            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Book, having for its subject <hi>Precedency,</hi> should have, for its Patron, that KING from whom our <hi>Precedency</hi> flows, as Rays do from the Sun: And beside the nobleness of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions here discuss'd, wherein Crowned-heads are oft-times the Clients, and Honour the Prize; These Discourses have the great Charms of newness and variety, which do singly so delight this Age, without any other advantage. I know, <hi>Sir,</hi> that Dedications have degenerated into Panegyricks; but why should I say any thing of You, of whom the most of Your Subjects be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve better things, than the most eloquent of Your Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats can express? It being amongst the other wonders of Your life, that You are the best lov'd, though not the best obey'd King in Christendom; the one being the effect
<pb facs="tcp:51654:3"/>
of our Conviction, and the other of Your admired Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency. And yet I might be allowed to say as much of Your Majesties merit, as some others of Your Subjects; having in those many occasions I had of attending You upon our publick Concerns, been oftentimes both pleas'd and asham'd to find You understand my Trade (that great Art of Reasoning) far better than my self; discovering to me the weakness of some of my Reasons, and improving others. But what I admir'd more was, (for I admire Iustice more than Wit) to find Your Majesty alwayes more concern'd for Your Peoples Security, than for Your own Prerogative: So that if any Kingdom be happier than we, it is because they understand better their own Interest and not because they have a better King. Leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then, Sir, this beaten path, I hope all wise and just men may expect, that none who owe You and Your Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors the Interest they have in Your Kingdoms and Parliaments, because of the Titles You have bestowed upon them, will be so ungrate and imprudent as to oppose You, to please a Re-publican Party, who would turn them out of all that Interest they have now in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and punish them most remarkably, by levelling them with the Populace which some adore. There is not a Nobleman in these Nations, who has not been raised
<pb facs="tcp:51654:3"/>
by the Royal Bounty; all Preferments of the Army or long Robe, being the reflex of Your Favour upon their merit, and without which, their greatest Parts had been at best, but excellent Colours lodg'd in the dark: And therefore, when they get Precedency, Preferments, Matches, or Respect, for being Noblemen, they ought to consider to whom they owe all this, and to remember how little they signified when a Common-wealth prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: And if any of their Creatures us'd them, as some have done the Monarchy, we should hear that Eloquence, which is now us'd to decry the Government and Your Ministers, employed in railing against the ingratitude of those their Creatures. Nor is it to be feared, that the Nobility and Gentry, who value themselves so much upon the just descent of their Blood, will bear patiently that the Royal Line should be cut, or the Succession diverted from its just and royal Channel; since Your descent, <hi>Great Sir,</hi> has the advantage over not only all Subjects, but likewise over all Monarchs, that we know, when their Predecessors rose from among the Vulgar; whereas, the first thing History discovers of Yours, is, that they were Kings: God having wrapt up Your Origin in this wonderful mysteriousness, as it were, to teach Your Subjects, that <hi>You hold Your Imperial
<pb facs="tcp:51654:4"/>
Crown of Him, alone and immediatly</hi>; and in shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them how to reverence You, has oblieged You to depend upon His Divine Majesty, the only and immediat Author, as well as Support, of Your Power and Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; and who has heap'd upon You so great, and so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable mercies, as may in letting Your enemies see his just indignation against them, let you also see, what sincere and exemplary Piety He, as Your kind and om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent Master, expects from You. I know, <hi>Sir,</hi> that You will allow me to own, that I hate Slavery, and love Property, as well as any of our high pretenders: But, I think our Freedom and Property securer under Your Majesty, whose Right cannot be shaken, without the ruine of ours; it being Your great interest to maintain that Law, which makes so many thousands obey You, in spight of their ambition and avarice. And I still see, that the true Proprietar is the kindest Master; whereas, on the other hand, it is certain, that they who oppose most the Government, are those who did themselves cruelly oppress us under the late Vsurpers, or their impenitent Children; Those, who being picqu'd at want, or loss of Preferment, are acted by revenge and malice; or these who are so easily fool'd, as to believe those who are such, and who inveigh against Your just Power, that they themselves may thereby
<pb facs="tcp:51654:4"/>
become arbitrary; many of whom are themselves greater grievances than any they exclaim against, and greater judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments than any they threaten. So that all we can expect is, to empty our Veins and Purses, for the liberty of being sold or trampled upon, as formerly, by such as have neither so great interest in us, nor affection for us; whilst You, <hi>Sir,</hi> generously pity what You may chastise, and suffer our extravagancies to grow up to be their own punishment. None of us can say, that we, or our predecessors have for six hundred years, felt the tyrannie of any of our Kings: nor can any of us deny, that all our Miseries and Civil Wars have sprung from the ambition and factiousness of Subjects, who design'd indeed to govern them and us; which should in reason make us rather jealous of our own factiousness, than of our Monarchie. And therefore, <hi>Sir,</hi> That God may alwayes teach Your Subjects to be just to Your Merit, and to remember the last Age; and may make Your Ministers careful to maintain, but not to stretch Your Prerogative, shall be the constant and ardent Prayer of,</p>
            <closer>May it please Your Sacred <hi>Majesty,</hi>

            <p>BEing desired to prove, that from Chronology it is Impossible, that <hi>Kenneth</hi> 3. King of <hi>Scots,</hi> did row <hi>Edgar</hi> King of the <hi>English</hi> Saxons over the <hi>Dee</hi>; I prove it thus: <hi>Kenneth</hi> the 3. did not Succeed to the Crown of <hi>Scotland,</hi> till the Year 977. At which time, <hi>Ethelred, Edgars</hi> youngest Son, did Reign in <hi>England: Ethelred</hi> having begun his Reign, <hi>Anno</hi> 975. two Years before <hi>Kenneths</hi> coming to the Crown of <hi>Scotland.</hi> It is also remarkable, that <hi>Heylen</hi> relates, that the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> was ordained at the Council of <hi>Constance,</hi> to precede the King of <hi>Castile,</hi> as being one of the five absolute Monarchs; which was inconsistent with his being a Tributary, or Homager Prince. This was done in Presence of the King of <hi>Englands</hi> Ambassador, who reclaimed not, as certainly he had done, if the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> had been Vassal to his Master. By all which we see how solidly <hi>Heylen</hi> writes upon this Subject. And the learned <hi>Speed</hi> doth in his History of Great <hi>Britain</hi> most Solidly, and Modestly, in many Parts thereof, clear us from this pretension; and especially in the Life of <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror, who, to clear Marches between <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> did set up a Cross at <hi>Stranmoor,</hi> with the Arms of <hi>England</hi> on the South side, and the Arms of <hi>Scotland</hi> on the North side; The King of <hi>Scotland</hi> doing only Homage for <hi>Cumberland.</hi> And in the Life of <hi>Edward</hi> the first, when some of the Great Men of <hi>Scotland</hi> waited on <hi>Edward</hi> in <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland,</hi> in the Controversie betwixt the <hi>Bruce</hi> and <hi>Baliol</hi>; he sayes, that <hi>Edward</hi> made then claim to the Superiority of <hi>Sotland,</hi> alledging that the Crown of <hi>Scotland</hi> was holden of him. To whom the <hi>Scots</hi> replyed, that they were ignorant, that any such Superiority belonged to the King of <hi>England,</hi> neither could they make answer to such things without a King, &amp;c. And that thereupon the King delivered to them his Letters Patents, in which he acknowledged, that the coming of those <hi>Scots,</hi> on this side the Water of <hi>Tweed,</hi> should not be at any other time urged to prejudice them, for coming again into <hi>England</hi>; That is, (sayes he) that their example should not so be drawen to an Argument of King <hi>Edwards</hi> right over them, as if they were to come again upon Duty: So prudently jealous (sayes this Author) were these Patriots of their Countries Liberty. And a little after, he acknowledges, that King <hi>Edward</hi> was then Plotting this Homage, because <hi>Scotland</hi> wanted a Head. He also confesses, that <hi>Baliol</hi> lost the love of the <hi>Scots,</hi> by the Homage he had made, and that by Letters to King <hi>Edward,</hi> he did afterward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce this Homage as being contrary to his Oath, as extorted by violence, and as being made without consent of the three Estates. And speaking of King <hi>Edwards</hi> big Oath, as that he swore by the Lord, he would consume all <hi>Scotland</hi> from Sea to Sea, if he heard any more debate in that; adds, that the <hi>Scots</hi> did boldly enough reply, that in this Cause they would shed their blood, for defence of Justice, and their Countries liberty. And further, in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, he observes, that this short lif'd pretence, was renounced by that King, who quitted <hi>Scotland</hi> of all claim and pretence of right to the Superiority thereof, and delivered up the Roll, called <hi>Ragmans</hi> Roll, wherein were contained the Names of those few <hi>Scots</hi> who had been forced to acknowledge this Superiority.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>ENS Ambition, as well as Curiosity, doth breed in them a Desire to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand this Subject, which is a part of the Civil Law, and Law of Nations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> exceeding as far all other parts of the Law, as Honour exceeds Money; But the same Ambition, which makes men very curious to know this Subject, will make them very unwilling to hear any thing that may decide against them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: And so such as writ upon it run a great risque of Displeasing those whom they intended to Satisfie. But my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe being to defend, and inform my own Countrey, I shall be little disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, though I want praise and esteem, since I do not deserve, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect either: And he is an unworthy man, who does not think the serving his Countrey a sufficient Sallarie, for greater Pains than I have here bestowed.</p>
            <p>Amongst those who are Supreme, Kings have the Preference from Commonwealths; and amongst Kings, the Emperour is allowed the first place, by the famous Ceremonial of <hi>Rome,</hi> as succeeding to the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours, who are alleadged to have been Universal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs; Because in Scripture they are said to <hi>have taxed the whole world.</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:51654:11"/>
And therefore the <hi>German</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> Lawyers, who are subject to the Empyre, have with very much Flattery, asserted that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour is the Vicar of GOD in Temporals, <hi>Bald. in l.</hi> 1. <hi>c. de Iure aur. an.</hi> And that Jurisdictions are derived from him, as from the Fountain; calling him, <hi>Dominum &amp; Caput totius Orbis</hi>: And for this they do very impertinently cite several Texts of the Civil Law, which being Laws made by the <hi>Romans</hi> themselves, cannot bind or prove against other Nations. Nor is the Translation of the old <hi>Roman</hi> Dignity upon <hi>Charles le maigne</hi> by <hi>Leo</hi> the 3. of greater Authority, amongst such as acknowledge the Pope to be no infallible Judge. And whatever may be debated against other Kingdoms, which were once Subject to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empyre; Yet his Plea against <hi>Scotland</hi> is very ill founded, since in the opinion of <hi>Scalliger,</hi> and the best of Historians, <hi>Scotland</hi> nor its Kings were never sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empyre, nor conquered by them; for they, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themselves against the <hi>Scots,</hi> were forced to build a Wall, called <hi>Vallum Adriani,</hi> which is Extant to this day as an undenyable Proof, that <hi>Scotland</hi> did set Limits to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empyre: And thus as <hi>Scal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liger</hi> observes, <hi>Romani Imperii fuit olim</hi> Scotia <hi>limes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is likewise pretended by the <hi>German</hi> Lawyers, that the Emperour ought to precede all others; because he is crowned with three Crowns, one of Iron at <hi>Aquisgrane,</hi> one of Silver at <hi>Milan,</hi> and one of Gold at St. <hi>Peters</hi> Church, <hi>Gloss. ad Clement.</hi> 1. And since the King of the <hi>Romans</hi> who is but Emperour in hope, debates with other Kings, as in <hi>anno</hi> 1533. he who is actual Emperour, ought to be preferred to them.</p>
            <p>For the Emperour it is also pretended, That in the <hi>Ottomon</hi> Court, and in all other Courts, the Emperours Ambassadors are still prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and that he only is still styled, <hi>your Majesty,</hi> in all Adresses made to him by all other Kings, as by <hi>France, anno</hi> 1628. by <hi>Pole, anno</hi> 1621. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that the Kings of <hi>Pole, Sweden, Denmark,</hi> and others have taken Confirmations from him, <hi>&amp; ab eo petierunt veniam aetatis, Hering. de fidejus. c.</hi> 2. And yet the Kings of <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>France</hi> may debate the precedency with him, because the Empyre is but Elective, whereas they are Hereditary, the Empyre is a Limited, but they have Absolute Monarchies, <hi>vide Peregrin. de jur. fise. tit.</hi> 1. <hi>num.</hi> 47.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> King debates his precedency with the King of <hi>Spain</hi>; the <hi>Spaniard</hi> contending that he ought to be preferred, because he is the most Catholick King, and King of maniest Kingdoms; and some of them are so foolish as to say, That the <hi>Spainish</hi> Nation is more ancient than the <hi>French,</hi> as owing their Origin to <hi>Athamaricus,</hi> one of the first Governours amongst the <hi>Goths.</hi> But for the <hi>French</hi> it is answered,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That they are the most Christian Kings.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That they are Consecrated and Anoynted.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That <hi>Swardus</hi> was first King of that Nation, in the Reign of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> the Great.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That they were preferred in many General Councils to the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> as in the <hi>Lateran</hi> Council, <hi>anno</hi> 1215. in the Council of <hi>Constans, anno</hi> 1416. and in the Council of <hi>Basil, anno</hi> 1433. That the <hi>Venetians</hi> preferred the <hi>French</hi> after much Debate, <hi>anno</hi> 1558. the Case being sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by both to that Senate; and <hi>Pius</hi> the IV. preferred him at <hi>Rome, anno</hi> 1564. the King of <hi>Spain</hi> having appealed from the <hi>Venetian</hi> to him.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51654:11"/>
And though the Emperour has of late decided in favours of <hi>Spain,</hi> yet that Decision is little considered, because of the Relation which the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour has to the <hi>Spainish</hi> Crown; And therefore the <hi>French</hi> King does very wisely send only Envoys and Residents to the Imperial Court, lest if he sent Ambassadours, the <hi>Spainiards</hi> might be preferred to his. Nor was this Precedency ever acclaimed by the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> till the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> the V. who being both Emperour and King of <hi>Spain,</hi> did begin this Debate; which after many Contests, the <hi>Spainiard</hi> has at last ceded, having commanded his Ambassadour, the Marquess <hi>de la Fuente,</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the same to the most Christian King, in Satisfaction of the Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry done to his Ambassadour, in <hi>anno</hi> 1661. at <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King of Great <hi>Britain</hi> founds his Precedency to both, upon 1. His being King of that Isle, which was first Christian. 2. Upon his being Anointed, and one of the <hi>quatuor Vncti,</hi> which were before all other Kings. 3. That having conquered <hi>France,</hi> in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the V. he has Right to all the Precedency which <hi>France</hi> can acclaim. And to <hi>Spain,</hi> the King of <hi>England</hi> was preferred in the General Councils of <hi>Pisa, Constans,</hi> and <hi>Basil.</hi> I find likewise in <hi>Golstad. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 30. That Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> the II. decided, after debate, in favours of <hi>Henry</hi> the II. King of <hi>England,</hi> against <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the V. <hi>Caspar. Eup. thesaur. polit. part.</hi> 3. <hi>apot.</hi> 63. And therefore in the Book of <hi>Roman Ceremonies,</hi> 1504. <hi>England</hi> was placed before <hi>Castil.</hi> nor can it be denyed, but that <hi>Charles</hi> the V. in ranking the Knights of the <hi>Golden Fleece,</hi> did give the right hand to the King of <hi>England,</hi> and the left to the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> And though of late the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> has decided in favours of <hi>Spain,</hi> yet that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the dislike that <hi>Rome</hi> had to <hi>England</hi> for its Separation, and the great Esteem which dayly grows there for <hi>Spain</hi>; because <hi>Spain</hi> has ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver indulged any who have left the Romish Church.</p>

            <head>CHAP. II. Of the Precedency due to the Kings of SCOTLAND.</head>
            <p>I Must here crave Leave to say, That the King of Great <hi>Britain</hi> may justly claim the Precedency from all those Kings, as he is properly King of <hi>Scotland.</hi> For it is an uncontroverted Ground in Law, <hi>That amongst those of equal Dignity, he, who first attained to that Dignity, is to be preferred, L.</hi> 1. <hi>C. de Consul. Quis enim prior esse debet in eodem genere Dignitatis, nisi qui prior eum adeptus est, L.</hi> 1. <hi>ff. de albo scribendo.</hi> With which agrees the Canon Law, <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. <hi>de major. &amp; ob.</hi> And this is declared the uncontraverted Test of Precedency, by <hi>Crus, de jur. preced. pag.</hi> 66. <hi>Menoch. concil.</hi> 51. <hi>&amp; Cuj. ad L.</hi> 2. <hi>C. de Consul.</hi> And
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51654:12"/>
we see that this Rule holds in all other Dignities, without respect to Riches, or multitude of Possessions: And thus amongst Dukes or Earles in all Nations, the first who attained to the Dignity, is still preferred; though others be much richer, and have suceeded to moe Earldoms.</p>
            <p>This being then the true and solid Ground of Preference, I may truly subsume, That the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> being equall in Dignity, with the Kings of <hi>England, France,</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> attained to that Dignity, before either of these. For our King <hi>Fergus</hi> came into <hi>Scotland</hi> 330. years before the birth of CHRIST; Whereas <hi>Polydor</hi> an <hi>English</hi> Historian, confesses that <hi>Egbert</hi> the first King of <hi>England,</hi> did begin his Reign eight hundred years after our Saviours birth, and the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> marryed the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Ambrosius Aurelius,</hi> who was the first King of the <hi>Britans,</hi> and whose Reign preceeded the Origin of the <hi>English</hi> Kingdom.</p>
            <p>As to the Monarchy of <hi>Spain,</hi> and their Race of Kings, they are no older than <hi>Rudolphus</hi> King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> elected in the year 1273. by whom the house of <hi>Austria</hi> did rise to this Dignity.</p>
            <p>As to the Kings of <hi>France</hi> who now Reign, they are only descended from <hi>Hugh Capet,</hi> who usurped that Throne in <hi>anno</hi> 987. And not being descended of either the <hi>Carolovingian</hi> or <hi>Merovingian</hi> Races, they cannot compet with our Kings, <hi>Achaius</hi> King of <hi>Scotland</hi> having been contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary with <hi>Charles le maigne,</hi> the first of the <hi>Carolovingian</hi> Race; and yet <hi>Achaius</hi> was but the 65. of our Kings, and the Leagues betwixt <hi>Achaius</hi> and the said <hi>Charles,</hi> are asserted not only by our Historians and the <hi>French,</hi> but confessed by all Strangers.</p>
            <p>To evite this Argument, some Historians have of late asserted, that we had no Kings before <hi>Fergus</hi> the II. and <hi>Cambden</hi> observes, that the <hi>Scots</hi> were unknown till the dayes of <hi>Constantine</hi> the great, which is a most unjust and groundless Calumnie; since four Monastries of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>viz. Melrose, Pluscarden, Paisley</hi> and <hi>Scoon,</hi> did keep constant and distinct Annals of all that past in this Nation, after the Establishment of the Christian Religion, which was in <hi>anno</hi> 199. and have transmitted to us what was delivered to them, by the pious and remarkable Christians of those first Ages of the World, who, as they were eye-witnesses of what past since our Christianity, so are not to be presumed to have recorded any thing of what preceeded their own age, without sufficient Warrand: And as it is incredible, that so Sincere and Pious men would have lyed, so it is not imaginable, that so many Societies would have conspyred to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, in a whole Tract of so circumstantiat a History as ours is; and there can be nothing brought to convell the Faith of so large a History, but what may, with the same force, be urged against the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, few or none having related what is said in the <hi>Roman</hi> History, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the <hi>Romans</hi> themselves: Whereas <hi>Galdus</hi> (or as <hi>Tacitus</hi> names him, <hi>Galgacus</hi>) opposed <hi>Agricola</hi> under <hi>Domitian</hi>; and that he was a <hi>Scot,</hi> is clear by <hi>Lipsius</hi> Notes upon that Place, <hi>Egregium membrum, &amp; qualta multa in corpore hujus Orationis Galgaci Scoti</hi>: But the Text makes this most clear to me, for this Discourse is said to have been made, <hi>ad mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem Grampium,</hi> which is known to be a <hi>Scottish</hi> Tract of Hills, dividing the North and South of <hi>Scotland. Hegesippus,</hi> who lived in the dayes of <hi>Hadrian</hi> the Emperour, and so an hundred and ten years before <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> does write of the <hi>Scots</hi> as a warlike People, to whose Authority
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51654:12"/>
               <hi>Cambden</hi> can make no answer, but that he contraverts the Authority of the Translation or Impression; by which answer, all Antiquity may be confounded; and seing that Translation was the work of St. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> it cannot but be above all censure. <hi>Claudian</hi> does make the Scots to have Reigned in the dayes of <hi>Honorius,</hi> for in his second <hi>Consulat</hi> he has,

And <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Westminster</hi> confesses, That we came into <hi>Britain</hi> in the 77. year after CHRIST: <hi>Beda</hi> likewise another <hi>English</hi> man, makes us to have been in this Isle, before the dayes of <hi>Iulius Caesar.</hi> And as it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denyed, that we were still subject to Monarchy, so no Historian can pretend, that we obeyed any Race, save that which now Reigns: Whereas we can condescend, where the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>French</hi> were conquered by Strangers, and had their Royal Line dethroned, and inverted.</p>
            <p>Another Ground of Precedency may be adduced for the King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> from his being the undoubted Lineal Sucessour of 110. kings: whereas the Lyne of <hi>France</hi> runs no higher than <hi>Hugh Capet,</hi> who lived in <hi>anno</hi> 987. and did in that time dethrone the former Race: The kings of <hi>Spain,</hi> are only descended from the Counts of <hi>Tierstiem.</hi> And the present kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> are descended from <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour. So that whatever may be pretended for the Antiquity of those kingdoms, yet their kings are not so ancient as ours: and Precedency ought to be given, amongst Equals, to the Eldest Race, and not to the eldest Kingdom. In such Dignities, the preference must be given, either according to the Antiquity of the People or Countrey, or Race which Reigns there. If the Countrey be considered, there can be no Precedency acclaimed by any; for as all countreys were created at the same time, so none can know which of these kingdoms were first inhabited: and that none can be preferred upon the Antiquity or Riches of their countrey, is clearly determined by Lawyers, <hi>Regionis, Locique, cui Principes praesunt, ratio, &amp; sic de eorum locorum prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantia, veterum elogia necquicquam ad praecedentiam faciunt, Gothofred. de praeced. cap.</hi> 3. <hi>num.</hi> 30. If we consider the Antiquity of the People, who are commanded, though that could give Precedency to them, or to any who represented them, yet that ought not to give precedency to the king; for, <hi>principum precedentia metienda est ex sua dignitate, non extra:</hi> And the Learned <hi>Speronius Speronii,</hi> hath proved this in a large Discourse, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the <hi>Italian</hi> Tongue; but if this be considered as a ground of prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, then we ought to be preferred to the <hi>English</hi>; for we are still the same People and Nation, but the <hi>English</hi> are not the old <hi>Britans,</hi> but are a mixture descending from <hi>Danes, Saxons,</hi> and <hi>French</hi>: And so we being the Eldest People, our King ought to have the precedency upon that account. Even as our king was preferred to the late kings of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> though they commanded the people who now live in <hi>Iudea,</hi> and who came in place of the ancient <hi>Iews,</hi> a kingdom very ancient formerly. But the Antiquity of the Race that Reigns, is the ground of precedency: For this reason it is, that the elder brother succeeds, without respect to the Greatness of Estate,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51654:13"/>
or Antiquity of those whom he commands. And though these considerations give preference <hi>inter impares dignitate,</hi> yet <hi>inter pares dignitate, familia quae prior dignitatent est adepta, semper praeferenda in incedendo, sedendo, &amp;c.

            <p>Since Christianity was established, Christian Princes have been preferred according to the date of their having received the Christian Faith, <hi>Gothofred. de jur. praeced. cap.</hi> 3. <hi>num.</hi> 23. <hi>Grotius de jur. bel. lib..</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. and that is the chief Ground of Precedency observed in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and especially in general Councils; but I conceive it ought not to be a Ground of Precedency any where else, since amongst Equals, the Antiquity of Blood ought to be preferred to the date of Christianity; Christianity ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther discharging all Care for Precedency: But even according to this Rule, the eldest Christian Race ought to be preferred, Religion having still Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to Christian parents; whereas on the other hand, it is of no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to any person, that he succeeds to an Estate which was formerly pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest by Christians, these having no Connection with one another: and a man should by the same Rule be preferred, because he dwells in a house where Christianity was first professed, which were in it self very ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous: And if the first Christian Race be allowed the Preference, the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> ought to be preferred; for <hi>Donald</hi> King of <hi>Scots</hi> imbraced the Christian Faith in <hi>anno</hi> 199. before either <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour succed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>England,</hi> or <hi>Hugh Capet</hi> to <hi>France,</hi> and long before <hi>Spain</hi> obeyed this Race of Monarchs; for which we can cite not only our own Historians, but <hi>Baronius ad annum</hi> 449. <hi>Duchesne,</hi> and many others, and particularly <hi>Beda</hi> and <hi>Polidor,</hi> the worthiest of <hi>English</hi> Historians. <hi>Beda</hi> relates, That <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buebantur a Scotis parvuli Anglorum, quin &amp; ipse Alsridus Anglorum Rex, in Insulis Scotorum operam dedit, &amp; sacras Literas didicit, lib.</hi> 3. <hi>hist. c.</hi> 27. <hi>Reges Angliae cupidi salutis aeternae, Legatos ad Eugenium quartum Scotorum Regem miserunt, ut ille digneretur Viros idoneos mittere, per quos illi Christianae Fidei Rudimenta docerentur, &amp; sacro Baptismatis fonte ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luerentur, quod ille haud gravate indulsit.</hi> Which clears fully, that our Kings were Christian before those of <hi>England,</hi> and so ought to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> by their own Arguments, and their own Authors.</p>

            <p>I cannot deny, but that in the Council of <hi>Constans, England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> were preferred to <hi>Scotland</hi>: but that proceeded, as <hi>Gothofred.</hi> observes, from the partiality of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which alwayes preferred those who were able to do them most Service; but if we consider the Principles of the Christian Religion: according to these, that Race ought to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, whose Title is justest; and I am sure, that according to this Rule, <hi>Scotland</hi> ought to be preferred, for its Kings have not Usurped over the People which they Governed. And not only does Religion consider this
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51654:13"/>
ground of Preference, as suteable to Devotion; but the Law considereth it, as suteable to Justice: And Lawyers have therefore thought a Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Kings, enjoying a just Title, free from Violence and Tyrrany, one of the chief Grounds of Preference and Precedency. And thus <hi>Vasquez. in praefat. ad illustres questiones,</hi> sayes, That <hi>multum ad nobilitatem &amp; praela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem confert, ex veris &amp; legittimis Regibus, &amp; non a Tyrannis descendisse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor does the Custome either of Courts or Councils, invert the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency which is founded upon Antiquity, and the right of Blood, from which Consuetude cannot derogat in the matter of Precedency, since that Consuetude is only respected in Law, <hi>quae in se rationabilis juri nec natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae nec gentium contrariatur:</hi> And likewayes since this matter of Preceden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is setled by Lawyers, upon these solid Foundations, for securing the publick Peace and Interest of mankind, it were unjust that the same should be so easily overthrown by the Partiality of Interested Church-men, or the Pride and Power of other Competing and Rival Princes; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to secure the Rights of Justice and Blood, against all such Invasions, Lawyers have unanimously concluded, that <hi>Consuetudine induci non potest ut prior in dignitate praeferatur posteriori, Crus. de praeemi. cap.</hi> 12. Which Principle they so farr assert as to conclude, that this could not be conceded even by express Paction, <hi>Rumellin. dissert.</hi> 1. <hi>thes.</hi> 18. even though that Paction were confirmed by an Oath, <hi>Rippa. ad l.</hi> 3. <hi>ff. de donat.</hi> And albeit it may seem that every man may renounce that which is introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in his own favours; yet to this it is answered, That men cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce what is introduced in their own favours, when that which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce was not principally introduced in their favours, but arose to them necessarily, by the Laws of Nature and Nations, or was introduced prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally, in favours of the common interest of Mankind, rather than of them, and in which, third parties would likewise be concerned: All which is clear not only by the principles of Reason, but by <hi>L.</hi> 3. <hi>ff. de pactis,</hi> and it cannot be denyed, but that the Precedency from the Antiquity of blood, is no such private Right as may be renounced, it being a priviledge not given by Law, but arising from nature, <hi>Lex non data, sed nata,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced for regulating the common Interests of mankind, and preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their differences or oppressions; whereas how unfortunate or irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar should men be? if subjects might force their Magistrates, or younger brothers the Elder, or stronger Princes the weaker, to Renounce by Pacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or might serue from them by Custom and Inadvertance, the Seniority and Precedency due to them; whereas now, the impossibility of prevailing in such Designes, takes happily away all lusting after them, and whatever may be ascribed to Consuetude or Decisions in that Precedency, which because it sprung meerly from Custome, may be regulated by it, or in dubious Cases, where a grain weight may cast a ballance; yet I see no Law nor Reason that can be adduced, for taking away by Decisions, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence, or Consuetude, a clear right of Precedency, founded upon the Antiquity of Blood. Especially since all who writ upon precedency are clear, That no man can prejudge his Successors, as to the precedency due to them by blood, <hi>Licet positus in dignitate suo ipsius facto, possit sibi prejudicium afferre, non tamen praejudicare potest quoad successores suos, Dec. consil.</hi> 21. <hi>num.</hi> 74. <hi>vid.

            <p>
               <hi>Vasquez.</hi> the illustrious <hi>Spainish</hi> Lawyer, did, at the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> adduce several Arguments for the precedency of the king of <hi>Spain,</hi> which, if they were well founded, would I confess, inferr a Precedency to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and which I shall the willinglier adduce and answer, that I have heard them urged for <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> against the King of <hi>Britain</hi>; and because they are the generall topicks and common places, which are necessary to be known, and understood for clearing not only the Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of Princes, but even of the Nobility and Gentry.</p>
            <p>The first is, That these who are most powerfull and greatest, ought still to be preferred, <hi>c. statuimus de major. &amp; obed.</hi> and he must be accounted most powerful, who is most powerfull, the time of the debate: <hi>Nam qualitas adjecta verbo, debet intelligi secundum tempus verbi, l. in dilectis § si extraneas ff. de noxalibus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second is, That those who command the noblest and best Subjects, are accounted the noblest and best, <hi>Authent. de defensoribus civitatum § nos igitur.</hi>
            </p>

            <p n="4">4. He is to be preferred in Dignity, whom generally men esteem the greatest.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Since Honour is the Reward of pains, and dangers, those who take most pains, and are lyable to most dangers for Christendom, and the Christian Faith, ought to have the precedency, in Christendom, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst Christian Princes: And that pains and dangers are grounds of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, is urged from <hi>l. semper § negotiatores ff. de jur. immunitat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. As all Goodness is the Nobler, the more communicative it be, so these must be concluded the Noblest, by whom most people have advantage: and therefore these Kings, under whom Trades flourish most, and who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow Sallaries upon, and give a livelyhood to most men, ought by Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to be preferred.</p>
            <p>To a'l which Arguments it is answered, that if preference were to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by choice, and did not descend from the Right of Blood and Antiquity, then the former Arguments were indeed considerable, and ought to direct the Electors; but where the Antiquity of Blood can be instructed, it still gives precedency, as is clear from the Authors above cited. And thus though we do confess, that the Kingdoms of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> are Richer, Greater, and more Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable upon these Accounts, than <hi>Scotland</hi> is; yet since the Race of our Kings is more Ancient than either of theirs, I conclude, That therefore they ought to be preferred.</p>

            <head>CHAP. III. That the <hi>CROWN</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> was not subject to <hi>England.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>SOme <hi>English</hi> Historians, Lawyers, and Heralds, do too frequently abuse the World with a most Groundless Tradition; by which they contend, That the Kings of <hi>Scotland</hi> were Vassals to the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> and did them Homage for the Crown of <hi>Scotland</hi>: Which if it were true, would have taken from the Kings of <hi>Scotland,</hi> not only the Precedency, for which I have been debating, but would have placed them after the Kings of <hi>Castile,</hi> and many others to whom they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred. And therefore, not only to remove this Objection, but to free my Country from this most unjust Imputation, I am Resolved (with very much Respect to the <hi>English</hi> Nation, whose Wit, Courage, and Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, I very much esteem) to inform the Curious, how unjust this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is; and to which I have been not only inclined, but forced, upon the Reading of a Rapsodie printed lately, by Mr. <hi>Prin, in Vindication</hi> (as he speaks <hi>pag.</hi> 487.) <hi>of the Dominion of the English Kings, against the Vngrate, Perfidious, and Rebellious Kings of</hi> Scotland. In which none of the Learned or Discreet <hi>English</hi> are concerned, since I find none who deserve that praise, engaged in this Debate, which has been agitated only by such of that excellent Nation, as have had more Humor than Discretion. I deny not, but that the Kings of <hi>Scotland</hi> did hold the Lands of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland, Cumberland,</hi> and <hi>Westmerland, in capite,</hi> of the Crown of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and that they did them Homage for it, which was not Dishonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to <hi>Scotland,</hi> that being most ordinary amongst Soveraigne Princes: For thus, <hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> and severall others of their kings, did Homage to <hi>Philip,</hi> and other kings of <hi>France,</hi> for the Provinces possest by them in <hi>France</hi>; and the king of <hi>Spain</hi> does at this day Homage yearly to the Pope, for <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily.</hi> And yet the Homage done for these Countrys, has been the occasion of an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Mistake in some, and a malicious pretext for others, to misrepresent the Homage done for these Counties, as done for the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland.</hi> And the Occasion of getting these Provinces from <hi>England,</hi> is too Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to be denyed by us; it being most undenyable, That the <hi>Scots</hi> being called in to assist first the <hi>Britans</hi> against the <hi>Romans,</hi> and thereafter the <hi>Saxons</hi> against the <hi>Danes,</hi> they had these provinces bestowed upon them, as a Reward of what they had done, and an Encouragement to them to continue their Friendship for the future. And by a Statute made by St. <hi>Edward,</hi> and ratified by <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour, as <hi>Holinshed</hi> observes, the <hi>Scots</hi> were for that Service likewise Naturalized <hi>English,</hi> for which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalization that Statute gives two Reasons, one, <hi>quia omnes ferme</hi> Scoti

            <p n="1">1.

And albeit all Domestick proof ought to be rejected in all cases, as suspect and partial; yet the <hi>English</hi> can adduce nothing, for obtruding this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude upon us, save the Testimonies of their own Historians, Lawyers, and Heralds.</p>

The Natural and Legal way of proving any man to be a Vassal, is by production of the Feudal Contract, betwixt the Superiour and Vassal; all Feus requiring necessarily writ in their Constitution: Nor can Vassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage be legally prov'd otherwise; whereas here the <hi>English</hi> can produce no formal, nor original Constitution of this Fue; such as is to be seen betwixt the Pope, and the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> the Emperour, and the Princes of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyre, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For all they can adduce, is only posteriour acknowledgements of this Vassalage, <hi>via facti,</hi> which is but a begging of the question; and these, being but Accessories, and Consequential Inferences, cannot subsist, except the original Constitution be first proved, no more then the payment of Feu Duties to a Superiour, either by Force, Ignorance, or Mistake, could prove the Payer to be Vassal for the future, except the originall Feu were produced: And as this is necessary in Law, so it cannot be imagined in Reason, but that some Obligation in Writ, or Feudal Contract, would have been taken by the <hi>English,</hi> who were a very wise people, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted very prudently their own Securities in every thing else: And if this Contract had been once entred into, it had been yet extant, since the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> cannot alleadge, that ever they lost any of their Monuments, or Records: And it is clear that we had Charters for these Lands we held in <hi>England,</hi> and that <hi>England</hi> had Charters at the same time, for the Lands they held in <hi>France</hi>: And it is very observeable, that in the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the 1. that King stiles himself, <hi>Rex, &amp; superior Dominus Regni Scotiae;,</hi> during his violent Usurpation over <hi>Scotland</hi>; whereas never any King of <hi>England</hi> did so formerly: And yet, if they had had any such pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions, they had assumed the same Titles; but this imaginary Title be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, and ended with the Force, which only maintained it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>English</hi> cannot condescend upon any Reason, which might have prevailed with the <hi>Scots,</hi> to have become Vassals to <hi>England,</hi> nor any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular time when they first became Vassalls; and all they can alleadge is, That upon some impressions of Force, some of our own Kings being prisoners, or some of our people being opprest, they did elicite from them acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgements of a Vassalage, formerly stated: Whereas Force, renders all
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51654:15"/>
acknowledgements null; and that these acknowledgements were null upon many other Accounts, and that the Kings of <hi>England</hi> have been forced, to grant the like to other Princes, shall be proved clearly, in answer to the Instances which the <hi>English</hi> adduce.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Scotland</hi> has been habite, and repute, and acknowledged to be a free Monarchie, and their Kings Independent and Supreme; and that not only by all Forreign Princes, (the best Judges in this Case) who have received and preferred their Ambassadours, as the Ambassadours of free Princes, but even in General Councils, the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> has been preferred to the Kings of <hi>Castile, Hungary, Pole, Navarr, Cyprus, Bohemia, Denmark</hi>; and thus they were ranked by Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> the II. <hi>anno</hi> 1504. <hi>vid. Besold. sinop. doct. politicae. lib.</hi> 20. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. Which could not have been done, if he had been only a Feudatory Prince; since all free princes, are preferred to all feudatory princes: Yea, and if <hi>Scotland</hi> had been Vassals to <hi>England,</hi> for the Crown of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Kings of <hi>England</hi> had certainly craved, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the precedency from other Kings upon that account, since he had been <hi>Rex Regum.</hi> And since <hi>France</hi> craved to be preferred to <hi>Spain,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the king of <hi>England</hi> was his Vassal, as <hi>Chassanaeus</hi> observes, <hi>part</hi> 5. <hi>consider.</hi> 19. so much rather ought the Kings of <hi>England</hi> to have been preferred; because they might have alleadged, that there was a Crown holden of them, whereas they held only some Feu-Lands of the kings of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Not only Christian Princes and Councils, but even Popes have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared <hi>Scotland</hi> to be a Free Kingdom, and Independent from <hi>England.</hi> And thus Pope <hi>Honorius</hi> allowed to <hi>Scotland,</hi> That is Subjects should not be obliged to answer, by way of Appeal, to any Court without their own Kingdom, <hi>salva solummodo authoritate sedis Apostolicae.</hi> 2. <hi>Edward</hi> king of <hi>England</hi> having petitioned Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the IV. that the Kings of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> might not be Anoynted or Crowned, without his Knowledge, <hi>quod non posset se facere, ipso inscio in Regem coronari vel inungi,</hi> the said Pope did refuse the same, <hi>presentibus procuratoribus parium in Consilio Lugdunensi, satis per hoc determinans Regnum</hi> Scotiae <hi>Regno</hi> Angliae <hi>non subesse.</hi> 3. The King of <hi>England</hi> having likewise petitioned the same Pope <hi>Innocent,</hi> that he might have Liberty to Collect the Tiths of <hi>Scotland,</hi> since he had Right <hi>terrarum omnium suae jurisdictioni subjectarum,</hi> the same was also refused. 4. Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the eight, does in a Letter to <hi>Edward</hi> king of <hi>England,</hi> Declare, That <hi>ad celsitudinem regiam potuit pervenisse, qualiter ab antiquis tempori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, &amp;c. quodque Regnum</hi> Scotiae <hi>(sicut accepimus) a progenitoribus tuis, Regni</hi> Angliae <hi>Regibus feudale non extitit, nec existit, &amp;c.</hi> The copy of which Letter I have at present. and <hi>Duchesne</hi> writing the History of Great <hi>Britain,</hi> does, <hi>pag.</hi> 661. relate, That <hi>le mesine Pape renvoya d' autres Lettres au roy d' Anglterre, pour soustenir que le royaume de Escosse ne depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doit point d' Anglterre, &amp; que contre le droit Divin, &amp; la justice il s' en vindicoit la subjection.</hi> That is to say, <hi>The same Pope sent Letters at the same time, to the King of England, in which he maintained, That the Kingdom of Scotland was no way subject to that Kingdom, and that his seeking to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject it to him as superiour, was contrare to the Law of GOD and Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. By the Feudal Law and Law of Nations, a Vassal cannot Mortifie any part of his Feu, without the consent of his Superiour; because the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour, by the Mortification, looses the Services due to him out of his
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51654:16"/>
Feu, Church-men being obliged to no <hi>reddendo,</hi> but <hi>Praeces &amp; Vota</hi>: And therefore in all Mortifications made by Vassals, the Superiours Confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is still required; and it cannot be imagined, but that if <hi>Scotland</hi> had been a Feu holding of <hi>England,</hi> the Popes, their Conclaves, and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastries themselves, would have sought Confirmations from the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> of the Mortifications made by the Kings and Subjects of <hi>Scotland,</hi> there being more Erections of that kind in <hi>Scotland,</hi> than in any Nation of equal Revenue; and yet never any such Confirmation was sought or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to: But on the contrare the Pope still confirms these Erections, as made <hi>per Reges Scotiae,</hi> as he does in all other Nations, or the Kings of <hi>Scotland</hi> confirm these Erections, if they be made by any of his Vassals: and it is observable, that the Pope does in these Confirmations designe our King, <hi>Regem Scotiae,</hi> and not <hi>Scotorum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. The Historians also of other nations, did concurr with those of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in asserting this freedom; and thus <hi>Arnisaeus,</hi> the best Lawyer who has writ upon these politick questions, does look upon this pretence, as a meer fiction, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. <hi>Anglus Scotorum regem habebat sibi fiduciarium sive ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione aliquot regionum, sive ratione ipsius regni, ut nimis audacter asserit. Math. Steph. Nam haec vetustate temporis, &amp; obscuritate authorum sunt incerta.</hi> And <hi>Duchesne pag.</hi> 21. speaking of <hi>Scotland,</hi> asserts positively, That its Kings does recognosce no Superiour but GOD, and is every way a Soveraign Prince, notwithstanding of the old pretentions of <hi>England, Le Roy le possede en toute souverainté sans recognoistre au cun superieur que dieu, bien que c' estoit an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cienne praetension des Anglois, que le Roy D'escosse est vassal de leur couronne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. Not only have forreign Princes, General Councils, and the Lawyers and Historians of other Nations, declared <hi>Scotland</hi> to be a free Kingdom, but even the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> have acknowledged this freedom, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency; as may appear by these instances. 1. The King and Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> have treated with the Ambassadours of <hi>Scotland</hi>; whereas no Superiour can treat with his own Vassal, as a forreigner; nor can a Vassal send Ambassadors to his Superiour; for an Ambassadour must be equal to him, to whom he is sent, and is, in Law, no way lyable to his Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

The same King <hi>Alexander,</hi> being to make homage in <hi>England</hi> to king <hi>Edward,</hi> for the Lands of <hi>Penrith</hi> and <hi>Tindale,</hi> which he held of king <hi>Edward,</hi> he did publickly protest, <hi>Quod non pro Regno Scotiae, sed pro terris in Anglia, dictum Homagium facie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat; Rexque iste Angliae hujusmodi Homagium admisit: per quod praesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitur talia fuisse, &amp; similia prius facta homagia, Regno Angliae per Reges Scotiae: Nam talia fuisse praesumitur, quale fuit illud declaratum &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positum Homagium; nam talia sunt subjecta, qualia praeadicata admittunt.</hi>

which are the very Words used in the Answer made by the <hi>Scots,</hi> before the Pope, where all the former four instances are fully discus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and were offered to be proved by Witnesses, beyond all Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the Writs themselves having been designedly taken away by king <hi>Edward.</hi> And <hi>Fordon</hi> has in his History, unprinted Copies of several Letters, written by the said Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> and others, declaring that those Instances consisted in their knowledge, and some of those Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are fully repeated, by <hi>Duchesne pag.</hi> 661. who is to be believed, since he is a Stranger: And even <hi>Matthew Paris,</hi> a Learned <hi>English</hi> Historian, does declare, That king <hi>Richard</hi> the first did, when he was going to the Holy War, disclaim this pretended Superiority over <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, anno</hi> 1188. Which Disclamation is likewise observed by <hi>Hovedean,</hi> another Historian of the same Nation: And when <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> speaks of the Homage done to the king of <hi>England,</hi> he makes it only to be for his Lands in <hi>England, Rex</hi> Scotorum <hi>Willielmus, fecit Homagium Regi</hi> Anglorum <hi>Ricardo de jure suo in Anglia.</hi> Which is ordinarly the stile used by Historians, when they writ of this Subject: And thus <hi>Duchesne</hi> sayes, that <hi>Alexander</hi> made Homage to <hi>Henry</hi> the third, for his possessions in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but refused to make him Homage for <hi>Scotland</hi>; and that king <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> sent a Cartell to king <hi>Henry,</hi> for asserting that he had made him Homage for <hi>Scotland.</hi> The Copy of the Homage is yet extant at <hi>Rome,</hi> and the minute of it is thus exprest, in the Records of our old Abbacies, <hi>Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randum, anno Gratiae milesimo ducentesimo septuagesimo octavo, Apostolorum Simonis &amp; Iudae apud Westmonasterium, Alexander Rex</hi> Scotiae, <hi>fecit Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magium domino Edwardo Regi</hi> Angliae, <hi>filio Regis Henrici sub his verbis, Ego devenero hominem vestrum pro Terris, quas de vobis teneo in Regno</hi> Angliae, <hi>de quibus Homagium vobis debeo, salvo regno meo; tunc dixit Episcopus Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vicensis, &amp; salvum sit Regi</hi> Angliae, <hi>si jus habuerit ad homagium vestrum de regno; cui Rex statim respondit, aperte dicens, ad homagium regni mei</hi> Scotiae <hi>nullus jus habet, nisi solus</hi> DEUS, <hi>nec de ullo teneo nisi solo</hi> DEO. 4. King <hi>Alexander</hi> having dyed without Males, <hi>Edward</hi> the first, treated for a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, betwix <hi>Margaret,</hi> Princess of <hi>Scotland,</hi> called the Maid of <hi>Norway,</hi> and <hi>Edward</hi> his son: In which there are many pregnant Acknowledgements of this Freedom, <hi>Volentes &amp; concedentes, quod deficientibus praedictis Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardo &amp; Margarita, vel eorum altero, absque Liberis extantibus, in omni casu &amp; eventu, in quo ad proximiores haeredes regnum praedictum debeat de jure reverti, integre habere, absolute absque ulla subjectione, revertatur &amp; restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atur iisdem.</hi> And in the close of that paper it is said, That there shall be no prejudice done to either of the kingdoms, <hi>Quin libere habeant statum suum</hi>: And in the Deputation given by the Governours of <hi>Scotland,</hi> dated at <hi>Melross, anno</hi> 1289. for treating that Marriage, this express Reservation is insert, <hi>Salvis tamen in omnibus &amp; singulis, &amp; per omnia, Libertate &amp; Honore Regni Scotiae</hi>: Which Reservation is likewise insert, in a Warrand granted by king <hi>Edward,</hi> for treating the said Marriage. And it is obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, That in all the <hi>Scottish</hi> Addresses to him, and accepted by him, he is only designed <hi>Rex Angliae, Dominus Hiberniae, &amp; Dux Aquitaniae,</hi> but never designes himself, <hi>Dominus superior Scotiae,</hi> till after the War; which shews, that his former airie Title was very unjust.</p>
            <p n="9">9. As the kings of <hi>England</hi> have acknowledged the <hi>Scots</hi> to be no Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals, so have their Laws and Lawyers. For it is contented by these, That
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51654:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the <hi>Scots</hi> were Aliens to <hi>England,</hi> and could not have succeeded to any Estate in <hi>England,</hi> without being Naturalized; whereas <hi>alibi genitura,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposes, that the <hi>alibi nati,</hi> are not Vassals: For this <hi>jus alibi geniturae,</hi> called by the <hi>French, droit d' aubeyne,</hi> is settled upon this Maxime of the Feudal Law, <hi>That because Feus are granted by Over-lords or Superiours, upon designe and promises, that their Vassals shal serve them upon all occasions, against all persons, and never reveal their secrets, nor conceal what may be their disadvantage</hi>; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Feudalists do justly conclude, That no man can be Leidge man to two supreme Superiours or Over-lords, because these Duties are imprestable to both; seing the secrets of the one, may be incompatible with the Safety of the other, and they may, by warring against one another, distract the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadgeance of their Vassal. And because men are more prone to serve their Native Prince, then others, therefore Strangers are alwayes suspect, nor have they allowance to sell the Feus, to which they succeed, lest they should carry away the price out of the Country, and possibly imploy it against the same Country. Which principle seems at first to have flowed from the <hi>Roman</hi> Law, by which, the Goods of Strangers dying in <hi>Rome,</hi> fell to the Exchequer or Fisk, <hi>&amp; fiebant caduca.</hi> With this foundation of the Feudal Law, founded upon so clear Reason, do the Customs of other Nations agree; who account not these Aliens, who live under the same Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadgeance: Thus <hi>Rageau pag.</hi> 67. <hi>Aubains sont estrangers, mais <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

And by the Custom of <hi>Milain,</hi> (the Expertest Feudalists of all the World) <hi>alibi genitura</hi> extends not to any, who have sworn Alleadgeance, and live within the <hi>Spainish</hi> Dominions, though not within <hi>Milain</hi>: since then the <hi>English</hi> would not allow us the Right of Sucession, nor the other benefits due naturally to Subjects, it was strangely monstruous and repugnant, that they designed to make the World believe that we were Subjects.</p>
            <p>It is also very remarkable, that if our Kingdom had been only a Feu holding of <hi>England,</hi> our Nobility could not have precedency from others, according to their Antiquity; for all the Nobility of the Superiour King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ought, in the opinion of such as writ of precedency, to be preferred to these, who live in the Vassal-kingdom.</p>
            <p n="10">10. If <hi>Scotland</hi> had been a Feu to <hi>England,</hi> the king of <hi>England</hi> as Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, would have had the keeping of our young Princes, and the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of them in Marriage, and the Feu would have been in his hand, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their Minority, that being implyed in the Right of proper Feus, by the Feudal Law: And this must be presumed to have been a proper Feu, as all Feus are presumed to be, except the Vassal can prove, that the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Feu was impropriated for the Vassals Advantage. But yet no king of <hi>England</hi> did ever pretend, to the <hi>Guardianship</hi> of our young Princes, nor to name Governours during their Minority: But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trare, <hi>Alexander</hi> king of <hi>Scotland,</hi> having left only a young Princess, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Margaret,</hi> who was Nice to the King of <hi>England,</hi> he did not pretend to the keeping of the young Princess, but intreated that she might be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, to <hi>Edward</hi> the second his son; and that if there should be no issue of that Marriage, <hi>Scotland</hi> should remain a free Kingdom, as it was formerly, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the dependent from all pretentions of the kings of <hi>England</hi>: Which is likewise another acknowledgement, made by the kings of <hi>England</hi> themselves, of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51654:17"/>
the independency of <hi>Scotland.</hi> And if the kings of <hi>England</hi> had been Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours of <hi>Scotland,</hi> there would have been some Vestige of this Superiority, to be seen in our Laws; whereas all our Laws call still our Crown, the Imperial Crown of <hi>Scotland:</hi> Or in our Coyne, all Coyns bearing some Impressions from the Superiour. And the Kings of <hi>England</hi> might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded from our Courts, or out of our Country, such as had committed crimes against their kings, or Laws: It being an undoubted principle of the Feudal Law, That <hi>qui habet dominium directum, potest jurisdictionem suam explicare, tam in territorio Vassalli, quam in suo: habet enim dominus jurisdictionem cumulativam cum Vassallo.</hi> But so it is, that it can never be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged, That the Kings of <hi>England</hi> offered to exerce any Jurisdiction in <hi>Scotland,</hi> or did require any criminals, who had fled into <hi>Scotland,</hi> to be delivered up to them: Nor did ever the <hi>English</hi> pretend to punish such <hi>Scotsmen,</hi> as were taken fighting against them abroad, as Traitors, and Guilty of Treason; as certainly they would have done, if they had been Vassals to <hi>England</hi>: But on the contrair, the <hi>English</hi> did also ransome them, and use them every way, as they did other Strangers and Forreigners.</p>
            <p n="11">11. The <hi>Scots</hi> having intended a Declarator of Freedome against <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the first, king of <hi>England,</hi> the Process was delegated by Pope <hi>Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi> the VIII. to <hi>Baldredus,</hi> one of the greatest Lawyers of that time, who considered very fully, the Reasons proponed <hi>hine inde,</hi> by both parties, and having made a full Report to the Pope, the Pope did very sharply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the king of <hi>England,</hi> and declared, that <hi>Scotland</hi> did not depend upon it, any manner of way; and that the <hi>English</hi> had attacked <hi>Scotland</hi> most unjustly, against all both Divine and humane Laws; as <hi>Duchesne</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves pag. 66.

            <p>In stating the Arguments, which are proposed by the <hi>English,</hi> for prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the kings of <hi>Scotland</hi> were Vassals, for their Crown, to <hi>England</hi>; I shall begin with these, which were insisted upon by King <hi>Edward</hi> the 1. in the former process.</p>
            <p>The first was, That <hi>Brutus,</hi> descended from the <hi>Trojans,</hi> did conquer <hi>Britain,</hi> and divided it amongst his three sons, to the Eldest of whom, called by Historians <hi>Locrin,</hi> or <hi>Locuus,</hi> as he is termed in that process, he left <hi>Logria,</hi> now called <hi>England</hi>: To the Second, called <hi>Albanactus,</hi> he left <hi>Albanie,</hi> now called <hi>Scotland</hi>: To the Third, called <hi>Camber,</hi> he left <hi>Cambria,</hi> now called <hi>Wales.</hi> But <hi>Humbert</hi> King of the <hi>Huns,</hi> having killed <hi>Albanactus, Locrin</hi> the elder, to revenge his brothers Death, did kill <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> and reunite <hi>Albanie</hi> to <hi>Logria</hi> or <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second was, That <hi>Donvall</hi> king of the <hi>Britans,</hi> killed <hi>Staterius</hi> king of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who rebelled against him, and became Master of the whole Isle; which <hi>Dunvall</hi> having two sons, <hi>Belinus</hi> and <hi>Brounus,</hi> he left the Superiority of <hi>Scotland</hi> with <hi>England,</hi> to the eldest, and the property only of <hi>Scotland</hi> to the second.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:51654:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>The third was, That <hi>Arthur</hi> king of the <hi>Britans,</hi> having overcome <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> he gave that kingdom to <hi>Angusell,</hi> who acknowledged him as his Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, and carried the Sword before him.</p>
            <p>The fourth was, That <hi>Aldestan</hi> king of <hi>England,</hi> having conquered <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> king of <hi>Scotland,</hi> did pray to GOD, that by the intercession of St. <hi>Iohn de Benlaco,</hi> he might by a miracle, be declared the just Superiour of <hi>Scotland</hi>: Whereupon he did strick with his sword, at a Rock near <hi>Dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar,</hi> and made a Gape in it a full yard in length.</p>
            <p>The fifth was, That <hi>William</hi> king of <hi>Scotland,</hi> did acknowledge himself Vassal, to <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour; <hi>Alexander</hi> king of <hi>Scots,</hi> acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged himself Vassal to king <hi>Henry</hi>: And that the Nobility of <hi>Scotland</hi> called in the said <hi>Edward,</hi> to arbitrate the Differences betwixt the <hi>Bruce</hi> and <hi>Baliol.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>Peter Heylen,</hi> speaking of <hi>Scotland</hi> in his Geographie <hi>pag.</hi> 1289. affirms, That the Kings of <hi>Scotland</hi> were still Vassals to the Crown of <hi>England</hi>; which he endeavours to confirm by these Arguments, 1. By the Homages, Services, and other Duties, done by the kings of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to those of <hi>England: Malcome</hi> the third doing Homage to <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour, as <hi>William</hi> one of his Successors, did to <hi>Henry</hi> the second; and that not only for three Counties in the North of <hi>England,</hi> or the Earldome of <hi>Hunting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doun</hi> (as is by some pretended) but for the very Crown it self: <hi>Kenneth</hi> the third being also one of those Titulary or Vassal Kings, who rowed king <hi>Edgar</hi> over the <hi>Dee.</hi> 2. By the interposing of king <hi>Edward</hi> the first, and the Submission of the <hi>Scots</hi> to that interposing, in determining the Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie of Succession, betwixt <hi>Bruce</hi> and <hi>Baliol:</hi> as in the like case, <hi>Philip</hi> the fair adjudged the Title of <hi>Artoys,</hi> which was holden of the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> and then in question betwixt the Lady <hi>Mawd,</hi> and her Nephew <hi>Robert:</hi> Or as king <hi>Edward</hi> the third, in the Right of the said Crown of <hi>France,</hi> determined of the Controversie, betwixt <hi>Iohn</hi> Earl of <hi>Montford,</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Bluis,</hi> for the Dukedom of <hi>Bretaigne.</hi> 3. By the Confession, and acknowledgement of Prelats, Peers, and others the Estates of <hi>Scotland,</hi> subscribed by all their hands, and seals, in the Roll of <hi>Ragman</hi>; wherein they did acknowledge the Superiority of the kings of <hi>England,</hi> not only in regard of such Advantages, as the sword had given him, but as his origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and undoubted Right: Which Roll was treacherously delivered into the hands of the <hi>Scots,</hi> by <hi>Roger Mortimer,</hi> Earl of <hi>March,</hi> in the begining of the Reign of king <hi>Edward</hi> the third. 4. By the tacite Confession of the kings themselves; who in their Coyns, Commissions, and publick Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, assume not to themselves the Title of kings of <hi>Scotland,</hi> but of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges Scotorum,</hi> or the kings of the <hi>Scots,</hi> and thereby imitating, that though they are kings of the Nation, yet there is some Superiour Lord (king <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramount</hi> as we may call him) who hath the Royalty of the Land. 5. By the Judgements, Arrests of the Courts of <hi>England,</hi> not only in the times of king <hi>Edward</hi> the first, but in sometimes since: For <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hen <hi>William Wallace,</hi> a Scotsman by birth, and the best Souldier of that Country, was taken prisoner, and brought to <hi>London,</hi> he was adjudged to suffer Death as a Traitor; which had been illegal and unrighteous judgement, had he been a prisoner of War, and not lookt upon by the Judges as subject to the Crown of <hi>England.</hi> The like done in the case of <hi>Simeon Fra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ll,</hi> another of that kingdom, in the same kings Reign. In like manner, in the time
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:51654:18"/>
of king <hi>Edward</hi> the third, it was resolved in the Court, in the Lord <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monts</hi> case, when it was objected, That one of the Witnesses was a <hi>Scot,</hi> and therefore as an Alien not to give his evidence, that his Testimony was to be allowed, because the <hi>Scots,</hi> in the Law of <hi>England,</hi> did not go for Aliens. And when one, indicted for a Rape, in the thirteenth year of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Reign, desired a <hi>medietatem linguae,</hi> because he was a <hi>Scots</hi>-man, and so an Alien; it was denyed him by the Court, because the <hi>Scots</hi> were not reputed here as Aliens, but as Subjects rather. So also, when <hi>Robert Vmsramville,</hi> Lord of <hi>Kyme,</hi> was summoned to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>England,</hi> in the Reign of king <hi>Edward</hi> the third, by the name of <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Angus,</hi> which is a Dignity in <hi>Scotland</hi>; and after in a Writ against him, was called by his own name of <hi>Vmsramville,</hi> without any Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of that Honour, the Writ was adjudged to abate; which I conceive, the Learned Judges had not done, if <hi>Scotland</hi> had not been reputed, to be under the Vassalage of the kings of <hi>England.</hi> 6. And lastly, by a Charter of Lands and Arms, which I have in my Custody, granted by king <hi>Edward</hi> the first, in the last year of his Reign, to <hi>Peter Dodge</hi> of <hi>Stopworth,</hi> in the Countie of <hi>Chester,</hi> one of the Ancestors of my mother: In which it is exprest, that the said Lands and Arms were conferred upon him, by that king for his eminent Services <hi>encontre son grand enemi &amp; rebel Baliol</hi> king of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and Vassal of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Answer to these Objections, founded upon the Reign of <hi>Brutus</hi>; I need say no more, save that <hi>Cambden,</hi> and the other Learned <hi>English</hi> Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, do look upon the same, as a meer fiction. And for proving the Crown of <hi>Scotland</hi> to hold of <hi>England,</hi> there must be authentick Documents in Writ produced, as has been formerly debated: And this does sufficiently an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer all that is said of <hi>Bellinus,</hi> king <hi>Arthur, &amp;c.</hi> But to refute these Fictions, and to show how much of Cheat is in all these Contrivances, I need only cite a passage, from the Learned <hi>Aylet Sammes,</hi> in his <hi>Britannia an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiqua, pag.</hi> 159. whose words are,</p>
            <p>
               <q>That which gave some Authotity to this Fiction, was the use king <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the first made of it, in vindicating his Title to <hi>Scotland,</hi> against the pretence of Pope <hi>Boniface,</hi> and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who laid claim to that kingdom by ancient Right, as part of St. <hi>Peters</hi> Patrimony, and that Churches <hi>Demesne.</hi> It appears, that the Monks and Friers had a great hand, in making out this Title by <hi>Brute,</hi> which story was now new vampt, and from all parts sent out of these shops, where at first it had been forged and hammered out. And this doth more evidently appear, if we consider many other parts of the same Letter, as it is found in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords cited by Mr. <hi>Prin</hi>; but especially that miracle of king <hi>Adelstane,</hi> who (<hi>in perpetuam rei memoriam</hi>) to give an evident signe of his Right to <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> with his sword, struck a blow upon a Rock near <hi>Dumbar,</hi> that he Cleft it at least an Elne wide.</q>
            </p>
            <p>As to the Homage made by king <hi>Malcome,</hi> to <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour, it is answered, That the matter of Fact is absolutely denyed: And not only do our Historians, and the Historians of Forreigners, mention no such sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, but they do on the contrair, relate, That <hi>William</hi> the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour having come with a Designe to conquer <hi>Scotland,</hi> he was forced by <hi>Malcome</hi> king of <hi>Scotland</hi> to a Peace, very Honourable and Advantagious for <hi>Scotland</hi>; one Article whereof was, That <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:51654:19"/>
should restore such of the <hi>English</hi> Nobility, as had fled to <hi>Scotland</hi> for shelter, to their Estates and Honours. And how can it be imagined, that <hi>Scotland</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then very Unite, and living under a most warlike Prince, would have submitted to a king, who had too much to do at home; or that King <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come</hi> would have submitted to him, whom he forced to restore even the <hi>English,</hi> who had Rebelled against him. And as the Constitution of Vassalage requires Writ, so if any such Vassalage had been acknowledged, he had accepted of a Charter holding of the Conquerour, as all the other Vassals did.</p>
            <p>As to King <hi>Williams</hi> Homage to <hi>Henry</hi> the second, it is Answered, That <hi>William</hi> having been treacherously made Prisoner, he was forced by a long and tedious Imprisonment, to make this Homage; and consequently, the Homage it self was null, being extorted by Force, and made by a person who was not <hi>sui juris,</hi> being in prison. It being certain by the Laws of all Nations, <hi>That Deeds done by Prisoners are null</hi>; but especially in this case, where the Deed was such, as that it would have been null however. For even the most absolute Kings, are so far from being able to alienate their Kingdom, or enslave it, that by so doing, (as some say) they forfeit their own Right, and make the Throne void for the next Successour, who is not obliged by what they have done. And if any such Act as this were binding, then <hi>England,</hi> by the same Argument, had remained a Feu of the Empyre; since <hi>Richard</hi> the first their King did Homage to <hi>Henry</hi> the Emperour, for <hi>England</hi>; and King <hi>Iohn</hi> his brother, did the like Homage to the Pope, and offered to hold <hi>England, in capite,</hi> of <hi>Murmelius</hi> a <hi>Sarazen.</hi> King <hi>Edgar's</hi> being rowed over the <hi>Dee,</hi> by <hi>Kenneth</hi> king of <hi>Scotland,</hi> is taken off by the former Answer, though it were true as it is not, nor can it be made appear, by a Chronological Computation, if the Enquiry were worth our pains.</p>
            <p>The great Instance founded upon the Homage made by the <hi>Baliol,</hi> is as weak; since it is known, that King <hi>Robert</hi> the <hi>Bruce</hi> refused to do Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to King <hi>Edward,</hi> choosing rather to want a Crown, then to be a Vassal for it: But <hi>Iohn Baliol</hi> the other Competitor, preferring his Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his Native Country, was therefore justly disowned by the Nobility, who (as <hi>Duchesne</hi> a Stranger to us observes) sent Ambassadours to King <hi>Edward,</hi> to show him that they did Revoke, and Disown the Homage made by the <hi>Baliol,</hi> and asserted their primitive Liberty. And so hateful an Act was this esteemed in him, that he losed the Crown by it; whereas had this pretence of <hi>England</hi> been founded upon any Justice, it could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have been so severly either opposed or punished. But though <hi>Baliol</hi> had been a lawful King as he was not, (King <hi>Robert</hi> the <hi>Bruce</hi>'s Title being preferable in Law;) yet could not the <hi>Baliol</hi> have subjected the Kingdom in Vassalage to <hi>England,</hi> since by the Feudal Law, a Superiour cannot su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perinduce or interpose another Superiour, <hi>nec sine Vassalli consensu alienare jus suum directum, c.</hi> 1. § <hi>ex eodem descendit de Leg. Lotharii.</hi> And though some debate, that by such Alienations of the Superiority, the Superiour forfeits his Right, yet all agree that the Alienation is null; <hi>nulla &amp; irrita,</hi> D. D. <hi>in cap. imperialem § praeterea de prohibit. alien. per Fredric. Curt. p.</hi> 16. <hi>num.</hi> 3. <hi>&amp; latissime Rosenth. cap.</hi> 9. <hi>conclus.</hi> 62.</p>
            <p>Whereas it is pretended, That the Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> consented; It is Answered, That any Parliamentary Consent is altogether denyed: For
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:51654:19"/>
though we have exact Records of all our Parliaments, yet there is not so much as Mention made amongst all our Statutes or Books, of any Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment held by <hi>Iohn Baliol.</hi> And albeit <hi>Prin</hi> has published all the Records, which the <hi>English</hi> have upon this Subject, yet he dares not so much as as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert, much less produce the Copy of any such Act of Parliament: And certainly if there had been such an Act of Parliament, not only the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of that Parliament, but that particular Act had been carefully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served and published; and that this Parliament and Statute is a meer Ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, appears not only by our own, but Forreigne Historians. And it is not imaginable, that the greater part of the Nobility and Kingdom, having immediatly disowned the <hi>Baliol,</hi> for acknowledging this Subjection, that they would themselves have ratified it in a free Parliament. But though this were true as it is not, yet there is not any Kingdom so Loyal, Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, or Invincible, but some few Cowards or Rogues may be found in it, who may assume the name of a Parliament, and disown the true Interest of the Kingdom, without any Warrand from the People for that effect. And I would very willingly know, if <hi>England</hi> remains still Vassal to the Pope, because a Monk prevailed with King <hi>Iohn,</hi> to hold his Crown of him? or if <hi>Portugal</hi> should not be acknowledged a free Crown, because <hi>Spain</hi> did once elicite from them a National Consent, by Force of Arms? Or if these three or four pretended <hi>English</hi> Parliaments, who acknowledged <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi> the Usurper, did settle a Legal Right upon him by their Concourse? Nor did Prescription Supply here the Original illegality of that Consent; for the <hi>Scots</hi> did immediatly reclame, and did within much fewer years, than Prescription requires, restore themselves to their Liberty, under the Conduct of that Glorious Prince, King <hi>Robert</hi> the <hi>Bruce,</hi> for whom GOD did so Miraculous things, as did Convince the World, how much the LORD of Hosts detasted the Bribry, and Cruelty of King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the first: <hi>Et ita res facile redeunt ad suam naturam, &amp; quae mox rediit divertisse non videtur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to show how great Aversion even that Generation had, for any such Submission to the <hi>English</hi> Monarchy, I have set down the Copy of a Letter yet extant, under all the Seals of our Nobility, directed to Pope <hi>Iohn,</hi> in <hi>anno</hi> 1320. Wherein they Declare, that if their King should offer to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to <hi>England,</hi> they would disown him, and chuse another. Not that the power of Electing Kings, was ever thought to Reside in our No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility; But because it was represented to them, as the Opinion of all Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, that a King could not alienat his Kingdom, or submit himself by his sole Consent, to a Forreigne Prince: Since by that Alienation and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, he does Forfeit his Right to the Crown. As to which Letter likewise I think fit to observe, to prevent any Mistake as to the Calculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the number of our Kings, that the Writers thereof have, as is usual with us, numbred amongst our Kings such of the Royal Family, as were for the time Regents or Viceroys. The Letter follows.</p>

               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:51654:21"/>This answers likewise <hi>Ragmans</hi> Roll; nor are we to consider who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to Slavery: Since it is known that not only the <hi>Dowglass,</hi> the <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hame,</hi> and <hi>Wallace,</hi> but Thousands of others, never yeilded even to that short Impression: And their Country preserved its Priviledges, by their Loyalty; it being an undoubted Principle in Law, That <hi>in re pari potior est conditio prohibentis, &amp; in re communi nemo dominorum juri quicquam fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere potest invito altero, l. subimus ff. ad exhibendum.</hi>

            <p>To that Argument by which it is urged, That our Kings did never as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume the Title of Kings of <hi>Scotland,</hi> but called themselves only Kings of <hi>Scots,</hi> It is Answered, That the Argument is very Ridiculous; for first it is founded upon a false Supposition, it being most evident from our Writs in the Reign of King <hi>David</hi> the Maiden, that our King was entituled, <hi>Rex Scotiae</hi>; but in the Confirmation of the Abbacy of <hi>Aberbrothick,</hi> King <hi>William</hi> is called <hi>Rex Scotiae,</hi> and his Queen <hi>Regina Scotiae.</hi> Like as in that Register, there is a Charter granted by King <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> wherein <hi>ad petitionem Willielmi Regis Scotiae,</hi> he grants a Liberty to the Monks of <hi>Aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brothick,</hi> to Transport their Goods through <hi>England,</hi> free from Custome: And <hi>Matth. Par.</hi> in many Treatises related by him gives them that Title: And Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the third, in an express Rescript in the body of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non Law <hi>cap.</hi> 4. <hi>decret. de immunit. Eccles.</hi> writes <hi>Innocentius III. Illustri Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi Scotiae,</hi> which behoved to be to King <hi>William,</hi> who did reign in that Popes time. Nor is this Argument from the Designation concluding, since it is not convertible; For even Feudatory Kings did, and do assume their Designation from the Kingdom they hold, as the Kings of <hi>Naples, Sicily, &amp;c.</hi> Which evinces that it follows not necessarly, that the Kings of these Kingdoms are Feudatory Kings; because they were designed <hi>Reges Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum,</hi> and not <hi>Scotiae.</hi> And in many places of his History <hi>Matth. Paris</hi> calls the Kings of <hi>England, Reges Anglorum,</hi> as in the whole Lives of King <hi>Iohn, Henry</hi> the third.</p>
            <p>It appears also, by the former Transaction betwixt <hi>Edward</hi> the first, and the Governours of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that <hi>Margaret</hi> is even by the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> constantly Designed <hi>Regina ac Domina Scotiae:</hi> And I observe, that in the Contract of Marriage, betwixt <hi>Henry</hi> the VII. for his Daughter Queen <hi>Margaret,</hi> and <hi>Iames</hi> the IV. that sometimes the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> is called <hi>Rex Scotorum,</hi> and sometimes <hi>Rex Scotiae,</hi> in the same paper; and the Commission granted by the King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> for compleating that Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, is called <hi>Commissio regis Scotiae pro matrimonio</hi>; in all which Contract, the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> is called, <hi>Charissimus noster frater,</hi> a Title never granted to a Feudatory King by his Superiour, and the people of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> are there called <hi>Subditi Regis Scotiae,</hi> whereas if the King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> had been only a Feudatory Prince, we had been Subjects to the King of <hi>England,</hi> and not to the King of <hi>Scotland.</hi> And there needs no other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument against <hi>Heylen,</hi> to prove that the Kings of <hi>Scotland,</hi> were oft-times called <hi>reges Scotiae,</hi> than the instance brought by himself, of the Charter granted by King <hi>Edward</hi> the first to <hi>Peter Dodge,</hi> wherein <hi>Baliol</hi> is confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by himself to be called <hi>Roy de Escosse,</hi> King of <hi>Scotland:</hi> And this proves that the said <hi>Heylen</hi> layes down Grounds, which are not only false, but inconsistent. But secondly, though this were true, yet it proves no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; seing the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi> were a free people; and yet their Kings were called <hi>Reges Pictorum &amp; Gothorum,</hi> which Phrase was ordinary
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51654:21"/>
amongst Conquering Nations, such as the <hi>Scots</hi> were, whose Princes ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at first no fixed Kingdom, did, whilst their people were spreading themselves in Collonies, rather assume a Title from the people, than from their Country. And seing Men are Vassals and not Land, it will follow, according to the terms used by Feudalists, that seing our Kings were <hi>reges Scotorum,</hi> that therefore the men were not Vassals; and so they hold not their Land of the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> nor were <hi>ejus subvassalli, aut Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vassores.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Argument urged from many Decisions in <hi>England,</hi> finding that we were punishable as Traitors in <hi>England,</hi> and that we were lookt upon as Subjects and not as Aliens, by their Judges, deserves no other Answer, then that since their Kings by their power, could not make us Vassals, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could their Parliaments or Judges treat us as such; And if their Gown-men could have made us such, they needed not have imployed Arms to have shed so much Blood in the quarrel: Nor can such Domestick Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies prove in a case of so great importance. And yet even the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Proceedings against those of our Nation shows, that their own Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories and Lawyers, consider us not as Vassals, but as the Subjects of a free and independent Kingdom. And amongst many other Instances, I shall only remember that of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> against whom that Nation proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not as a Vassal, but as a person who had made her self lyable to their Jurisdiction, <hi>ratione loci delicti.</hi> Which is very clear by <hi>Zouch. de judicio inter gentes, part.</hi> 2. <hi>sect.</hi> 6. whose very words I have here set down, to prove not only this, but that the Kings of <hi>Scotland</hi> were <hi>absoluti,</hi> and equal to, and independent from those of <hi>England,</hi> being both <hi>pares &amp; absoluti princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes,</hi> His words are, <hi>Erant boni rerum Estimatores, qui asperius cum illa actum affirmabant, eo quod fuerit Princips libera &amp; absoluta, in quam solius Dei sit Imperium, quod in majestatem peccare non posset, cui subdita non fuerit quod par in parem non habeat potestatem, unde judicium Imperatoris in Rober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum Siciliae regem, irritum pronounciatum est, quia Imperio ejus non esset sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditus. Alii aliter censebant, illam scilicet, subditam esse etsi non originariam, tamen temporariam; Quia duo absoluti principes quoad authoritatem, in uno Regno esse non possunt; parem in parem habere potestatem, quoties paris judicio se submiserit, vel expresse verbis, vel tacite contrahendo, vel delinquendo, intra paris scilicet jurisdictionem, &amp; Papam sententiam Imperatoris in Robertum Sicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lùm rescidisse, quod factum in territorio Imperiali non fuerit, sed Papali. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nique nullum magnum extare exemplum, quod non aliquid ex iniquo habeat.</hi> And in the Process against the Bishop of <hi>Ross,</hi> as it is related both by the Forreign Lawyers, and by <hi>Cambden,</hi> it clearly appears that he was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded against, not as a Subject of <hi>England,</hi> but as a meer stranger, who not being subject <hi>ratione originis,</hi> became subject <hi>ratione delicti,</hi> as they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged. And the Learned Author of the late <hi>jus maritimum, pag.</hi> 451. ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving spoken of the Jurisdiction of <hi>England</hi> over <hi>Ireland,</hi> has these words,
<q>But in <hi>Scotland</hi> it is otherwayes, for that is a Kingdom absolute, and not like <hi>Ireland,</hi> which is a Crown annexed by Conquest, but the other is by Union: And though they be United under one Prince <hi>ad fidem,</hi> yet their Laws are distinct, so as they had never been United; and therefore the Execution of the judgements in each other, must be done upon Request, and that according to the Law of Nations.</q>
Nor need I answer the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment brought from the procedure, against the Heroick <hi>Wallace</hi> and others,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51654:22"/>
for these instances show rather an excessive resentment upon present Hosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, then the Justice of those, who against the Law of Nations, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to murther such as were indeed prisoners of War, fighting for their own Native King and Country: And even the <hi>English</hi> of that age, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into Truces, Ransoming of Prisoners, and doing all other things (which are only allowable in a just War) may convince all Mankind, that in this and the like Instances, they succumb'd to the bitterness of their present Passion.</p>
            <p>I must here also crave Leave to assert, That though Vassals are not to be treated as Aliens, yet we find very frequently in History, that whole Nations have been Naturalized, and have had all the Priviledges of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects communicated to them, without being Vassals or Subjects: And thus the <hi>Pelopidae</hi> were naturalized <hi>Persians,</hi> by <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> King of the <hi>Persians,</hi> and allowed to enjoy all their Priviledges, in remuneration of the great Services done by them to the <hi>Persians,</hi> as <hi>Plutarch</hi> observes in the Life of <hi>Pelopidas</hi>: And thus the <hi>Athenians</hi> communicated their Priviledges to the <hi>Rhodians</hi>; and the <hi>Latins</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> as <hi>Livius</hi> observes <hi>lib.</hi> 25. And it is very clear, that the like was done by the <hi>English</hi> to us, by a Statute of St. <hi>Edward,</hi> which is yet extant in a Book called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> published by <hi>William Lambert, anno</hi> 1568. And Ratified by the Conquerour, amongst the good Laws of that Prince, as <hi>Hollenshed</hi> observes. Amongst others who are to be reputed of the same Nation with the <hi>English,</hi> we find the <hi>Scots</hi> mentioned in the Statute; for which two Reasons are given in it, <hi>quia om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nés ferme Scoti proceres ex Anglis conjuges coeperunt, &amp; ipsi rursus ex Scotis, &amp; sic sacti sunt duo in carne una</hi>; That is to say, Because most of all the <hi>Scotish</hi> Nobility did take Wives of <hi>English</hi> Extraction, and the <hi>English</hi> of <hi>Scotish.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second Reason added in that Statute is, <hi>quia simul &amp; in unum contra Danos &amp; Norwegos atrocissime pugnaverunt.</hi> And it is very well known to such as understand History, that untill these late and unhappy Wars, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned by the Shires of <hi>Northumberland, Westmorland</hi> and <hi>Cumberland,</hi> the <hi>Scots</hi> assisted the <hi>English</hi> in all their Wars; especially, as that Statute sayes, against the <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Norwegians,</hi> by whom they were called by those In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaders, to share in the Victory; but they refused the offer, and fought near two hundred Years against these Usurpers: In which Wars, they are said to have lost two Kings, with an hundred thousand Men; all which the <hi>Scots</hi> might have preveened, by suffering the <hi>Danes</hi> to pass peaceably to <hi>England,</hi> through their Territories. And it is observable in the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of both Nations, that the <hi>Danes</hi> were never expulsed from <hi>England,</hi> till they were first beat in <hi>Scotland</hi>; till at last they were forced to swear, that they should never return into this Isle; and in Return of which Assistance, we got from <hi>England</hi> this Priviledge in the same manner, that <hi>Lewis</hi> the XII. communicated to us a general Naturalization in <hi>France,</hi> with all the Priviledges competent to the Natives of that Kingdom, when we were forced to associat with it, to secure our selves against the invasions of our old friends.</p>

Yet others think him, upon that account, the less preferable, because he is thereby in a manner no free and Soveraign Prince; <hi>Peter King</hi> of <hi>Denmark</hi> having really become Vassal to <hi>Fredericus</hi> 1. Emperour, <hi>Otto. Fris. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 21. But <hi>Pontanus</hi> relates that the Emperour did upon this account give him the right hand, and thereby preferred him to <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</hi> I find also in the Council of <hi>Basil,</hi> that <hi>Ravallus</hi> Arch-bishop of <hi>Vpsale,</hi> did claim Precedencie to his Master the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> from all the Christian Princes, he being the true Successour of the <hi>Gothish</hi> Kings, who exacted Tribute even from the Emperours and Kings of <hi>France.</hi> Both <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Sweden,</hi> claim the Precedencie from the King of <hi>Pole,</hi> as an Elective and Limited Monarch: And in the Ceremonial of <hi>Rome, Pole</hi> is placed after the other two: And it is undenyable, that <hi>Sigismund</hi> King of <hi>Swed,</hi> being chosen King of <hi>Pole,</hi> he did in all his papers prefer always the Title of <hi>Sweden</hi> to that of <hi>Pole.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King of <hi>Pole</hi> has debated for Precedency with the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> in <hi>anno</hi> 1557. But at <hi>Rome,</hi> Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> the second, preferred <hi>Portugal</hi>: And yet the Debate was renewed under <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, In whose Reign, both their Ambassadours meeting in his Court at Church, and the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour of <hi>Portugal</hi> having possest the first place, the other made a sign, as if he would have spoken in private with him, at which the <hi>Portugal</hi> rose, whereupon the <hi>Polonian</hi> run in to his seat, <hi>Hottoman de Legat. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 21.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>Hungarie</hi> contests for Precedency with the King of <hi>Pole</hi>: But in the interview betwixt <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Emperour, <hi>Sigismund</hi> King of <hi>Pole, Vladislaus</hi> King of <hi>Hungarie,</hi> and <hi>Lodowick</hi> King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> in <hi>anno</hi> 1515. the King of <hi>Pole</hi> was preferred to walk on the Emperours right hand. But this Controversie being renewed at the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> They, as all other Kings were ordained to take place, not according to their Dignities, but according to the date of the Production of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions in the Council.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>Hungarie</hi> argues for the Precedency from the King of <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia</hi>: Because, amongst the Emperours Titles, <hi>Hungarie</hi> is set down before <hi>Bohemia</hi>; But <hi>Bohemia</hi> oppons the Golden-bull of <hi>Charles</hi> the fourth Emperour, Wherein it is ordained, that in all Acts which concern the Empire, <hi>Bohemia</hi> shall proceed all other Kings: So that it seems that the

King of <hi>Hungarie</hi> ought to preceed in all things not relating to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; But that <hi>Bohemia</hi> is to preceed in all that relates thereto.</p>
            <p>There are other Soveraigns who are not Crowned-heads, Such as <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy, Mantua, Florence, Ferara, Parma, Venice,</hi> who Debate also their respective Precedencies in this manner.</p>

And the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> did contend with him, though his Competition was not sustained, <hi>vid. Crus. pag.</hi> 511. And though the Title of Eminencie was bestowed upon the Dutchess of <hi>Mantua,</hi> by <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the second; Yet that was a Complement bestowed by the Emperour, rather with respect to her Sex, and her Relation to the Imperial Family, then to the true Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity due to her as Dutchess of <hi>Mantua, vid.

            <p>The Duke of <hi>Florence</hi> was still preferred to the Duke of <hi>Ferara,</hi> by <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, And <hi>Port. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Resp.</hi> Juris. 167. confesses, That <hi>Florence</hi> was acknowledged to be first, by the Emperour, by <hi>Rome,</hi> and by <hi>France</hi>: But yet <hi>Paul</hi> the third considering that the Dutchie of <hi>Florence</hi> was onely erected in <hi>anno</hi> 1531.

            <head>CHAP. V. The Precedencies amongst Common-Wealths.</head>
            <p>IT cannot be denyed, but that Kings and Crowned-heads have the Precedency from Common-wealths; though they contend that they being the Freest of all men, are the Noblest; And being in Effect a Countrey of Kings, ought to be preferred to any one King: Especially, since their Government is elder then that of Kings, men having drawn themselves into Societies, before they either submitted to Kings who assum'd that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by Force, or Elected Kings, because they could not agree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themselves.</p>
            <p>There are some Common-wealths who claim precedency, as having right to Kingdoms: And thus <hi>Venice</hi> claim'd the same precedency with Crown'd-heads in the Popedom of <hi>Vrban</hi> the eight, and <hi>Innocent</hi> the fifth, because they had right to the Kingdom of <hi>Corsica</hi>; But this was denyed.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>States General</hi> contend with <hi>Venice,</hi> and all other Common-wealths, as being the more powerful, and being a Society of Common-wealths. They pretend also to Precedency from all the Princes of the Empire, as being more Independent then they, and being equal to Kings; Whereas these Princes are but Subjects, which is delicately Debated by <hi>Besold. de praeced. cap.</hi> 2.

               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Whereas the Arch-bishop of <hi>Cullen,</hi> was to take place in all his own Dyocie, and in <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>France.</hi> And of old in the Election of the Emperour, the Bishop of <hi>Mentz</hi> was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred as Arch-chancellor of <hi>Germany</hi>: The Arch-bishop of <hi>Treves</hi> as Arch-Chancellour of <hi>France</hi>: And the Arch-bishop of <hi>Cullen</hi> as Arch-chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of <hi>Italy</hi>; Which Order was confirmed by <hi>Frederick</hi> the 1. <hi>anno</hi> 1158.</p>
            <p>The Secular Electors are Ranked thus, by the <hi>Golden-bull</hi> of <hi>Charles</hi> the fourth.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> carries the Sword, immediately in all Processions before the Emperour: The <hi>Count-Palatin</hi> the Imperial Aple, walking on the Emperours Right hand: The Marquess of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> the Scepter, on the Left hand; And the King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> was to follow him immediately. But when they sit at any Solemnity, by the same Bull, The King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> (being a Crowned-head) was to sit first, upon the Emperours Right hand, after the King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of <hi>Mentz,</hi> and <hi>Cullen</hi>: And upon the Left, after the Ecclesiastick Electors, the Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> had the first place, and the Marquess of <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburg</hi> the second. But yet I find <hi>Beutherus,</hi> and other <hi>German</hi> Lawyers, contend from old Manuscripts, That at first <hi>Brandenburg</hi> had the Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency from the Electors, <hi>Palatin,</hi> and <hi>Saxony.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> did of old Contend with the Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> in <hi>anno</hi> 1521. and their Debates continued by protestations for many years; And with the Elector <hi>Palatin,</hi> till the Emperour <hi>Lewis</hi> the fourth Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained the <hi>Palatin</hi> and <hi>Bavaria</hi> to preceed one another alternately: Though since the late Waries of <hi>Germany,</hi> the Elector <hi>Palatin</hi> having Usurped the Crown of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> was made the first Elector in his place, the Elector <hi>Palatin</hi> being now the last of the Electors.</p>
            <p>It is also observable, That if any of the Electors themselves be present, they
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:51654:24"/>
are preferred to the Ambassadours, and Representatives of all the absent Electors; as was Decided in <hi>anno.</hi> 1654. Excepting onely the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours of <hi>Austria,</hi> and the Ambassadours of Forreign Kings, were still al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to take place from all the Electors, except the King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> in all the Solemnities of the Empire. But the Ambassadours of Common-wealths having claimed the same precedency, The Emperour <hi>Leopold</hi> has Decerned against them, in favours of the Electors, <hi>Crus. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 4.</p>
            <p>The eldest Sons of the Electors preceed all the other Princes of the Empire.</p>
            <p>The Arch-dukes of <hi>Austria</hi> have the first Seat next to the Electors.</p>

            <p>The <hi>Roman</hi> Patriarch was by <hi>Phocas</hi> the Emperour raised above all the rest, in the year 606. since which time they have raised themselves by several Degrees to the <hi>Papacy,</hi> though it cannot be denyed but even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time, the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> had the first Seat in all Councils, as is clear by <hi>Iustinians Novella.</hi> 131. <hi>cap.</hi> 2.

us, <hi>lib.</hi> 98. That the Learned <hi>Brissonius</hi> President of the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> would not suffer the Popes Legat to preceed him. And at the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation of <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, the Pops Legat was denyed the precedency from the Electors.</p>
            <p>The Cardinals have Debated for Precedency with the Patriarchs, though by the <hi>Novella,</hi> 132. <hi>c.</hi> 2. <hi>Iustinian</hi> places Patriarchs next to the Pope: And <hi>Panormit. in cap. antiqua</hi> X <hi>de privileg. &amp; excess.

            <head>CHAP. VIII. General Observations concerning the Precedency of Subjects.</head>
            <p>NObility is devided with Us, as in <hi>England</hi> in <hi>Nobiles Majores &amp; Minores,</hi> the Greater and the Lesser Nobility: Under the Greater are comprehended all such as are Lords of Parliament: Under the Lesser are comprehended Knights and Gentlemen. And though all these be not Peers of Parliament, yet they are all Peers to one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; And thus a Gentlemen may be offered to a Dukes Daughter, whose Ward and Marriage falls to the King, as has been often decyded, nor can that Match be refused upon the account of Inequality: And it hath been found, that though Noblemen must be judged by their Peers, yet Landed Gentlemen may pass upon their Assyse; and a Nobleman is oblieged to accept of a Challenge from a Gentleman as his Peer, where Duels are Lawful. Under the word Barron all Our Nobility are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, as is clear by the 81. <hi>Act. Parl.</hi> 14. <hi>Ia.</hi> 2d. And the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of the first Parliament of K. <hi>Ia.</hi> 5th. where the Parliament is said to be holden <hi>per Regis &amp; Regni tutorem una cum Praelatis Barronibus &amp; Burgorum Commissariis.</hi> Albeit the Parliament of <hi>Rob.</hi> 1. was <hi>cum Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copis, Abbatibus, Prioribus, Comitibus, Barronibus, &amp; aliis Magnatibus,</hi> which shews, that there were other <hi>Magnates infra Barrones.</hi> It may be Doubted, Whether the Younger Son of Dukes, Marquesses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are to be Ranked <hi>inter Nobiles majores,</hi> since they sit not in Parliament; Or
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:51654:26"/>
               <hi>inter Nobiles Minores,</hi> since they are designed Lords, and take place from many of the <hi>Nobiles Majores.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Sons of the Kings of <hi>France</hi> were all Kings, and Soveraigns in the first two Races, Because, according to the old <hi>German</hi> Custom, the Few and Honours were devided equally amongst the Sons: As now all the Sons of a Duke are Dukes there, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But thereafter all the other Children, except the Eldest, got onely place and Precedency according to their Offices or Dignities, until <hi>Philip de Valois</hi> Succeeded as Prince of the Blood in a remot Degree; After which, the <hi>French</hi> thought fit to give Precedency to those, who might one day be their King: And so all the Princes of the Blood got precedency from all Subjects.</p>
            <p>With Us the Kings Children, Uncles, and Nephews, onely had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency from all Subjects; And in SCOTLAND no remoter Degree preceed as Princes of the Blood, For the Families of <hi>Hamiltoun, Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghorne, Fintrie,</hi> and others are Descended from Our Kings by lawful Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, but had no precedency upon that account.</p>
            <p>The first place next to the King is due to the Prince of SCOTLAND amongst Us, who is likewise Duke of <hi>Rothesay</hi>; as the second Son is Earle of <hi>Ross,</hi> that being an Appanage inseparable from him by Act of Parliament: But at present his Royal Highness is with Us Duke of <hi>Albany,</hi> as he is Duke of <hi>York</hi> in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It has been doubted, Whether the Kings Son, Uncle, Nephew, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have the Precedency from the Kings Officers in the actual exercise of their Office, as at Coronations, Riding of Parliaments, in which it is the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stables</hi> priviledge to ride upon the Kings Right hand, and the <hi>Marishals</hi> on his Left, in his return from the Parliament house: The Reason of which Difficulty is, because these are Acts which follow the office and not Blood, and the Nature of the Action requires that they should be posted, where they may be most serviceable. I find likewise, that this hath been Debated in <hi>France,</hi> whereupon in <hi>anno</hi> 1576. <hi>Henry</hi> the third emitted an Ordinance in Favours of the Princes of the Blood; And with Us, his Royal Highness the Duke of <hi>York</hi> at His <hi>Majesties</hi> Coronation preceeded all the Officers.</p>
            <p>Amongst the Princes of the Blood, the Last descended from the Royal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily has still Precedency accordingly; But though this hold in the Branches, yet the Eldest of the same Branch will preceed all of that Branch, and thus the Prince <hi>Palatins</hi> Grand-Child would succeed to the Crown before Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> his Brother, though Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> be several Degrees nearer.</p>
            <p>I find that of old all Church-men were Ranked together, and were first Ranked before all Laicks: And thus the Parliament of King <hi>Robert</hi> the first, was <hi>habito Solemni tractatu cum Episcopis, Abbatibus, Prioribus, Comi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus</hi>; and even before the Kings Sons, Brothers, or Nephews. Thus King <hi>Robert</hi> the first grants a Charter to the <hi>Abbacy</hi> of <hi>Aberbrothick,</hi> Confirming a Ratification made to them be <hi>Lundie,</hi> wherein the Witnesses are, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verendis</hi> Waltero <hi>&amp;</hi> Gilberto <hi>Episcopis, &amp;c.</hi> Davide <hi>Duce de Rothesay, Comite de</hi> Carrick, <hi>Carissimo nostro Filio primigenito,</hi> Roberto <hi>Duce de</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bania <hi>Comite</hi> Fyffe <hi>&amp; Fratre nostro</hi>: And even the Abbots and Priors were Ranked before them, and when any of them were Officers of State, they were named according to their Ecclesiastick preferments: Thus <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobo Sancti</hi> Andreae <hi>Episcopo,</hi> Galvino <hi>Archiepiscopo</hi> Glaseuensi <hi>Cancellario nostro.</hi> And in the Session when it consisted of half Church-men, half
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:51654:26"/>
Laicks, the Church-men sat on the Chancellors Right hand, and Voted first: But it does not follow from these Instances, that therefore of old any Church-man did take place from the Kings Son, no more then that a Bishop took then place of an Earl, because he was named before them.</p>
            <p>The Archbishop of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> was by a special Letter in <hi>anno</hi> 1626. and Renewed in <hi>Ianuary,</hi> 1664. Declared to have the Precedency from the Chancellor, and all His <hi>Majesties</hi> Subjects: In time of Popery, he was <hi>Legatus natus,</hi> and both then and now he is <hi>totius Scotiae Primas</hi>; But though by this Letter he is Ordained to take the place of all Subjects, yet I think it would not give him place from the Kings Sons, Uncles, and Nephews, though they be likewise Subjects; since the word Subjects must be here Interpret according to the Custom of Nations, by which these near Relations of Princes are preferred to all other Subjects. The Nobility of <hi>Scotland</hi> were either Declared such by Feudal Erections, their Lands being Erected by the King in a Dutchy, Earldom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which did of it self make him a Duke or Earl, in whose Favours the Lands were so Erected; Or else they got Patents of Honour, Declaring them Dukes, Earles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and this is a much later way, none being Nobilitated by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents amongst Us before King <hi>Iames</hi> the first.</p>
            <p>The third way of Nobilitating with Us, is by Creation and Solemn In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vestiture, the whole Form whereof will in all its Ceremonies be best known by the following Narration.</p>

               <p>The two Earles conveyed be the forenamed Noblemen in their respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Robes, and Crowns on their Heads:</p>
               <p>Coming before the King they made their Reverence; Then they were led up by the Master of Ceremonies some steps, and sitting down on their Knees on Velvet Cushions, the <hi>Lyon</hi> made an Harrangue, both to His <hi>Majesty</hi> and to them, Declaring to the Noblemen, That it pleased His <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty</hi> to promote them to that Dignity, and that he desired them to Fear GOD, and obey His Power: Then he took their Oaths, that they should obey GOD, his <hi>Majesty,</hi> and mantain the Religion then profest. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after the <hi>Lyon</hi> delivered to His <hi>Majesty</hi> the Patents, and His <hi>Majesty</hi> redeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered them to the <hi>Lyon,</hi> who gave them to the Noblemen, In token that they should obey GOD and His <hi>Majesties</hi> Laws: Afterwards, the <hi>Lyon</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered His <hi>Majesty</hi> the Marquesses Coronets, His <hi>Majesty</hi> redelivered them to the <hi>Lyon,</hi> The <hi>Lyon</hi> put the Crowns on their Heads, saying, <hi>Iohn</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess of <hi>Hamilton,</hi> Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi> Lord <hi>Even,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>George</hi> Marquess of <hi>Huntly,</hi> Earl of <hi>Enzie,</hi> Lord <hi>Gordon,</hi> and <hi>Badzenoch,</hi> &amp;c. The same was Proclaimed furth of the windows by the <hi>Heraulds</hi> and <hi>Pursivants,</hi> with sound of Trumpet: Then were they conveyed to their Seats, and placed above the Earles, upon the Kings left Hand, Trumpets sounding.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Lyon</hi> desired His <hi>Majesty</hi> to Honour the Gentlemen, who bare the Honours, with the Honour of Knight-hood, His <hi>Majesty</hi> consented: The <hi>Lyon</hi> caused them sit down on their Knees at the foot of all the Stage, and after he had made an Exhortation to them, and received all their Oaths, they holding up their Hands, and promising to obey all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions, The <hi>Lyon</hi> presented the Sword to His <hi>Majesty,</hi> who stroke each of them therewith on the Right shoulder, and Sir offered the Spur, the <hi>Lyon</hi> first proclaiming their Styls, and after the <hi>Heraulds</hi> and <hi>Pursivants</hi> at the windows with sound of Trumpet.</p>
               <p>I find this Difference in the Creation of many Earles from what is here set down, That the four Gentlemen bear the Honours thus, The first, the Penon; the second, the Standart; the third, Sword and Belt; the fourth, the Crown; and lastly, the <hi>Lyon</hi> bear the Patent in a Velvet bag: And that the <hi>Lyon</hi> offered first to His <hi>Majesty</hi> the Sword and Belt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it back, put it on the Person Nobilitat.</p>
               <p>As also when the King was not present, and after His going to <hi>England,</hi> The Ceremony was performed be His <hi>Majesties</hi> High Commissioner, if there
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:51654:27"/>
was one at the time; Or otherwise a Writ was direct to the Lord Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor appointing him Commissioner for that Creation, And then the first thing that was done after the person to be Created was brought in, the <hi>Lyon</hi> gave the Patent to the Commissioner, who gave it to the Register, or Clerk of Council to be read. And I Observe this in all Our old Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that if the person to be Dignified was a Lord formerly, he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed in be two Lords, and the Ceremony of the new Creation being over, was conveyed to his place by two of that degree to which he was advanced.</p>
               <p>The <hi>English</hi> Nobility are sometimes Created by being called in a Write to Parliament, under the Designations of Earles, Viscounts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which way is unknown to Us in <hi>Scotland,</hi> though the King may introduce it at His pleasure.</p>

               <p>The Precedency amongst Our Nobility differs nothing from what is here set down, <hi>England</hi> and We agreeing in all points since the Union of the two Kingdoms; And especially since the Coronation of King <hi>Charles</hi> the first, at which time, he Declared he would have it so: But to prevent Differences betwixt the Nobility of both Kingdoms, It was Ordered, That all those of the same Degree in <hi>England,</hi> should in <hi>England</hi> take place from all those of the same Degree in <hi>Scotland</hi>; And all those of the same De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in <hi>Scotland,</hi> should in <hi>Scotland</hi> take place of the <hi>English</hi>: That is to say, All the <hi>English</hi> Dukes should take place in <hi>England</hi> of all the <hi>Scots</hi> Dukes; And all the <hi>Scottish</hi> Dukes in <hi>Scotland,</hi> should take place of all the <hi>English</hi> Dukes, which was very Just and Suetable to the Laws of Nations.</p>
               <p>But as to the Ranking of Our Officers, We Differ much from <hi>England</hi>: For clearing whereof, it is fit to know, That with Us there were Officers of the Crown, and Officers of State: The Officers of the Crown were all Designed of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as <hi>Constabularius Scotiae, &amp;c.</hi> In King <hi>Malcom</hi> the II. his Parliament; The Offices then Extant were, The Chancellour, the Justice General, the Chamberlain, the Steward, the Constable, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishal; and they are thus Ranked and have their Respective Fees. But by the <hi>Act</hi> 31. <hi>Parl.</hi> 11. <hi>Ia.</hi> 6. The Offices of the Crown are Declared to be, The Thesaurer, Secretar, the Collector, (which Office is now joyned with the Thesaurers) the Justice General, Justice Clerk, Advocat, Master of Requests, Clerk of Register: And though these be called Officers of the Crown there, I conceive they Differ not from the Officers of State; And these words Officers of the Crown, and Officers of State are now Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollent Terms, so far that all the Officers of State are Officers of the Crown by this Act: But the High Chamberlain, Constable, Admiral, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishal, are Officers of the Crown, but are not Officers of State; The spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciality of Officers of State being, That in all Acts or Meetings which concern the State, they sit as Members by Vertue of their office, as in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, Conventions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where the Chamberlain and Admiral come not as such, nor the Constable and Marishal if they were not Earles.</p>
               <p>The Officers of State have oft contended for Precedency amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: And therefore King <hi>Iames</hi> did in Privy Council, upon the 17. of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:51654:28"/>
                  <hi>Iune,</hi> 1617. Declare, That in that and all other Parliaments, none should sit as Officers of State, save eight, and though there should be moe of the saids Officers by Deputation, Division, or otherwise; Yet eight onely should sit, which eight he did thus Rank by Act of Council; Thesaurer, Privy-Seal, Secretary, Register, Advocat, Justice Clerk, Thesaurer-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put, Mr. of Requests: And yet His <hi>Majesty</hi> having appointed Sir <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bald Atchison</hi> to be second Secretary, and he having contended that his place was to be next the principal Secretary; This was Opposed by the Register and Advocat, founding themselves upon the said Act of Council: It was answered thereto, That His <hi>Majesty</hi> might, notwithstanding of the said Act, have as many Secretaries as he pleased, and by that His <hi>Majesty</hi> was only Limited to eight Officers of State in Parliament; But that notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof, he might make use of any eight he pleased, and accordingly he had made use of the Chancellor, Collector, and Comptroller, as Officers of State in several Parliaments, notwithstanding that they are none of the eight Officers mentioned in this Act; Likeas K. <hi>Ia.</hi> had appointed the Lord Chancellor, being a Nobleman, to sit amongst the Noblemen, and not as Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, or an Officer of State: The Council did remit this Debate to the King.</p>
               <p>I find that upon the 20. of <hi>February,</hi> 1623. the whole matter of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency amongst His <hi>Majesties</hi> Officers and Counsellors is thus Stated:

               </p>
               <p>It is observable from this Act, that Lords of the Session have Precedency from Privy Councellors in <hi>Scotland,</hi> otherwise any Counsellor of an elder Admission would be preferred to them; And yet in <hi>England,</hi> Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors are preferred to all the Judges, and even to the chief Justices: And with Us I find no Privy Councellor take place as such, from any person whatsoever, which seems very strange; For since the Judicatur it self is placed before the Session, and that its President hath Precedency from the President of the Session, that therefore its Judges ought to preceed the Judges of the Session. 2<hi rend="sup">do</hi>. Though the Lords of Session are Lords of Council and Session, yet there being Secret Councellors, gives them a greater nearness, and Argues a greater Trust: And in all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Precedency, these are the Chief Topicks for Precedency. 3<hi rend="sup">o.</hi> In Law Counsellours are called by the Emperour, <hi>Pars Corporis nostri l. quisquis C. ad L.

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:51654:29"/>
                  <hi>Magni Concilii,</hi> and the Senators of the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> is De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated by <hi>Boerius,</hi> and he prefers the Counsellours; And in <hi>Sweden</hi> they have place from all the Nobility. 5<hi rend="sup">o.</hi> The Lords of Privy Council have more supereminent power, then the Lords of Session: For they can stop the Precedor of the Justices, they can Adjourn the Session, they can grant Precognitions, moderat punishments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Notwithstanding of all which, such Respect has Our Kings to the Lords of Session, who Distribute Justice Equally to the People, that they still preferred them to all the Subjects, except the Lords of Parliament, and their eldest Sons.</p>
               <p>It has been contended by the Younger Sons of Noblemen, That they ought to have Precedency from the Lords of Session; Because, sayes the second Son of an Earl, I have Precedency from the Eldest Son of a Lord, and yet he has place from the Lords of Session, and it is a certain Rule in Precedency, That if I preceed you, I must preceed him who preceeds you: And if an Earles second Son, and a Lords eldest Son, and a Lord of Session did meet together, the Earles second Son could not preceed the Lords eldest Son, except he preceeded also the Lord of Session. To which nothing can be answered, save that the eldest Sons of Peers, being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptive Peers, and such as will be Peers, It is fit that the Lords of Session, who have but a Temporary Precedency, should not preceed them.</p>
               <p>But I find that though in <hi>England,</hi> the younger Sons of the preceeding Rank, take still the place from the eldest Son of the next mediat, as the younger sons of Dukes, from the eldest sons of Earles, and the younger Sons of Marquesses from the elder Sons of Viscounts: And that all the Chain of Precedency is founded upon this Gradation, and that it seems that Nature has led men to this Establishment; Yet the eldest Sons of Our Lords (Lord Barons) refuse to Cede to the second sons of Earls, and it was so of old with Us, and that which may be given as a Reason for this, is, that it is unreasonable, That they who are to be Peers, and to have a constant Title, should Cede to such as have but a Temporary Honour; But if this Reason were sufficient, the younger Sons of Dukes should not preceed the eldest Sons of Lord Barons.</p>
               <p>With Us the eldest Sons of Lord Barons are Design'd Masters, as the Master of <hi>Rosse,</hi> &amp;c. And of old the Uncles of Lords, after the Death of their elder Brother, though he left a Son, were called Masters, till the Nephew had a Son: For which I know no other Reason but that, because they wanted a Tittle, they took this: For their Father being Lord, there was no Degree below to take, as the elder Sons of Earles took that of Lord. And I believe, that thus the word Master was given in <hi>England</hi> to meaner People, when their name was not known: For though the word <hi>Dominus</hi> was refused by <hi>Augustus,</hi> as importing Slavery, which the <hi>Romans</hi> could not bear, rather then from a secret Impulse, as St. <hi>Augustin</hi> sayes, In respect Our <hi>SAVIOVR</hi> was then Born, who was the True Master, since <hi>Sueton</hi> tells, That <hi>Tiberius</hi> also refused this Title; yet in Complement even then such as were not known, were called <hi>Domini: Obvios</hi> (sayes <hi>Seneca) si nomen non succurrit, Dominos salutamus,</hi> and thereafter with the <hi>Roman</hi> Slavery this Title grew from being a Complement, to be a Duty: And thus the <hi>Grecian</hi> Emperour was called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and the eldest son <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: and from this Title of Master, came Meship amongst Us, which was given to all such as had not a special Title, as Lord, Sir, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Parliament 1. <hi>Charles</hi> the second, which Act of Parliament was made to declare that he was Presedent of the Exchequer, as well as of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Courts, this having been pretended to by the Thesaurer: He hath his title not from the power of Cancelling, as the old Gloss sayes, That <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellarius est qui habet Officium scripta responsaque Principis inspicere, &amp; male scripta Cancellare</hi>; For it is not imaginable that he would take his title from what he destroys, and not from what he does: But from the <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celli</hi> and Barres, within which the Judges did sit inclosed, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>I find that in the Laws of King <hi>Malcolm Keanmore,</hi> the Chancellour is placed before all the Officers, and sometimes many of the considerable Earles are placed betwixt him and the rest of the Officers: Thus King <hi>Alexander</hi> grantes a Charter, <hi>Testibus</hi> Willielmo <hi>de</hi> Bosco <hi>Cancellario meo,</hi> Malcolmo <hi>Comite de</hi> Fyffe, <hi>Alano Senescall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> Scotiae, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some think that there is a Difference betwixt <hi>Cancellario meo,</hi> whom they make Director of the Chancery, and <hi>Cancellario Regni,</hi> whom they make High Chancellour: And others make a Difference betwixt <hi>Cancella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium Regni &amp; Cancellarium Regis,</hi> as <hi>Spotswood</hi> in his <hi>History</hi> observes. But I find that the High Chancellour is called <hi>Cancellarius meus,</hi> as in the foresaid charter, and sometimes <hi>Cancellarius</hi> simply, and sometimes <hi>Cancellarius Noster,</hi> and sometimes <hi>Regni,</hi> and sometimes <hi>Cancellarius Scotiae</hi>; And the same <hi>Willielmus de Bosco,</hi> is in the <hi>Chartularies</hi> of <hi>Aberbrothick,</hi> and <hi>Calco,</hi> or <hi>Kelso,</hi> named under all these Designations.</p>
               <p>I find the Director of the Chancery, was onely a servant to the Chancellour of old: For in King <hi>Malcolms</hi> time, amongst the Fees to be payed to the Chancellours Clerks, there is a Fee to be payed to his Clerks for the Breeves, which Breeves belong to the Director of the Chancery; And therefore <hi>Skeen</hi> does justly Observe, <hi>hinc liquet Officium Directoris Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellariae apud majores nostros ad Cancellarium pertinuisse,</hi> and which is very clear by the Statutes of King <hi>Rob.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>vers.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>I find that in these Laws, <hi>Iusticiarius,</hi> that is to say, The Justice General is placed next the Chancellour, but afterward <hi>Scotland</hi> was divided in two
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:51654:30"/>
Justitiaries, on upon the <hi>South</hi>-side of <hi>Forth,</hi> who was called <hi>Iusticiarius Lothaniae,</hi> and in old Charters <hi>Iudex Laudoniae</hi>: And the other on the <hi>North</hi>-side of <hi>Forth.</hi> The Justice General is now neither Officer of the Crown, nor Officer of State; But yet he thinks he ought to have Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency from the President of the Session, the Justice Court being older than the Session; And being President of a supream Court, he is to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed any Inferiour Member of any other Supream Court: And the King by Declaring that he advanced the Register, when he made him Justice General, has clearly signified, that the Justice General ought to preceed the Register: This place likewise has been generally possessed by Noblemen, and is the same with Us, that the Chief Justice of the Kings Bench is in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>: And this Jurisdiction was amongst others possessed at <hi>Rome,</hi> by the <hi>Praefectus Praetorio,</hi> who was their chief Magistrat.</p>
               <p>The Justice Clerk by the foresaid Statutes of King <hi>Malcolm,</hi> appears to have been but his Clerk; And though by the foresaid Act of the 11. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament K. <hi>Ia.</hi> 6. The Justice Clerk be named before the Register and Advocat, yet that is onely <hi>ob continentiam causae,</hi> because they are set down, The Justice, Justice Clerk, and their Deputs. It is Observable by that Act, that the Justice General is put after the Thesaurer and Secretary, and there the Justice Clerk is not made his Officer, as in the Laws of King <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colm Keanmore.</hi> I find that <hi>Alanus, Iusticiarius Scotiae,</hi> Designs himself <hi>Hostiarius &amp; Iusticiarius Scotiae,</hi> which shews that <hi>Hostiarius</hi> was a prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Office: and this I take to be Commander of the Kings Hoast; For <hi>Ostiarius</hi> is not written with an <hi>H,</hi> and is a meaner Office then Justice Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral: This Charter is granted in <hi>anno</hi> 1253. to the Abbacy of <hi>Aberbrothick,</hi> and though others may mistake the Ranking of a mans Titles, yet the Bearer will carefully Rank his own Designations.</p>
               <p>The third Officer named in those Laws is the High Chamberlain, <hi>Came<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarius Domini Regis:</hi> And I find him in all the old Writes placed as Witness, before all the other Officers, next to the Chancellour. There was <hi>Magnus Camerarius,</hi> who was chief Judge over all the Burrowes; And there were other under Chamberlains, who are oftentimes Designed <hi>Camerarii,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the adjection of <hi>magnus</hi>; And I find in a Charter granted be K. <hi>David,</hi> in <hi>anno</hi> 1495. the witnesses are, <hi>Alexandro Domino Huyme, magno Camera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio nostro, Iohanne Domino Drumond Iusticiario nostro, Ricardo Murehead Secretario nostro, &amp; Waltero Drumond nostrorum Rotulorum, &amp; Registri, ac a Consiliis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is Observable, that the Officers were oft-times named according to the quality of the Bearers, and not according to the precedency of the Offices: But in the former Charter, <hi>Dominus de Huyme</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>Dominus de Drumond,</hi> being of the same quality, the Chamberlain is put before the Justice Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. This Office of Chamberlanry was possessed Heritably of late by the Dukes of <hi>Lennox,</hi> and the Badge was a Golden Key.</p>
               <p>This Office is the same with <hi>praepositus Sacri Cubiculi,</hi> mentioned by <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinian,</hi> and equall'd by him to the <hi>Praefectus Praetorio,</hi> and placed <hi>inter il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustres Palatinos,</hi> or Counts of the Palace, And is now in <hi>France</hi> called <hi>Grand Chambrier,</hi> and was constantly possessed by the Family of <hi>Burbon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I find the <hi>Magnus Camerarius</hi> placed before the Thesaurer in a Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, <hi>anno</hi> 1520. to the Abbacy of <hi>Aberbrothick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Senescallus Domini Regis,</hi> is next in these Laws, that is to say, The
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:51654:30"/>
High Steward of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Allanus Senescallus Scotiae,</hi> is very Famous in all the old Charters, and he is still placed before the Constable and Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>schal: And it appears, that the High Steward, and the Steward of the Kings House were the same, for those Laws mention only the Steward of the Kings House; but now the Prince is <hi>Senescallus natus Scotiae</hi>: Under him are there placed the <hi>Panetarius,</hi> who commands over all the Bakers, and <hi>Butte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larius,</hi> who commands over all the Keepers of Taverns, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I find the Lord <hi>Souls</hi> was <hi>Buttelarius Scotiae,</hi> in the Letter before set down, Directed from the Nobility of <hi>Scotland</hi> to the Pope, in the Reign of King <hi>Robert</hi> the <hi>Bruce</hi>; And I have seen a Charter, wherein <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Thomas Murrayes,</hi> sons to the Governour of <hi>Scotland</hi> Sir <hi>Andrew Murray,</hi> were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed <hi>Panetarii Scotiae,</hi> upon the Forfeiture of <hi>Iohn Cunning</hi> Earl of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teith,</hi> in <hi>anno</hi> 1348. which Earl of <hi>Monteith</hi> was formerly <hi>Panetarius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next to these are named in the foresaid Laws, the Constable and Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>schal: But now the Constable and Marischal take not place as Officers of the Crown, but according to their creation as Earls; The Reason whereof I conceive to be, because of old, Offices did not prefer those who possessed them, but they took place according to their Creation; whereas now the Privy-Seal precedes all Dukes, and the Secretary takes place before all of his own Rank: But the Constable and Marischal, being now the onely two Officers of the Crown that are Heretable in <hi>Scotland,</hi> continue to possess as they did formerly: But in <hi>France, England,</hi> and all other places, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable and Marischal take place as Officers of the Crown; and it seems very strange, that these who Ride upon the Kings right and left Hand, when he returns from His Parliaments, and who guard the Parliament it self, and the Honours, should have no Precedency by their Offices; And yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny, but that of old, other Earls were placed before them, for in the former Charter granted by King <hi>Alexander, Malcolm</hi> Earl of <hi>Fife</hi> is placed before them.</p>
               <p>And I conceive their Precedency has not risen of late to the same pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion with others; Because of late Our Armies have been commanded by other Officers, and so there was little use for the Constable and Marischal.</p>
               <p>The Constable with Us in these <hi>Northern-Nations,</hi> is the same Office that the <hi>Comes Stabuli</hi> was under the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, which may be confirmed by two clear Testimonies of great Antiquity, one is of <hi>Aimon. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. <hi>Land<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> gesilis Regalium praepositus equorum, quem vulgo Comes Stabuli vocant</hi>; The other is from <hi>Rhegino, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Annalium Burchardum Comitem Stabuli sui (quem corrupte Constabulum appellabis) cum classe misit in Corsicam:</hi> Though the Learned <hi>Cujac.</hi> does believe that this Title comes from the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which signifies, a company of Men of War, <hi>ad l. unic. de Comit. &amp; Tribun. Scolar.</hi> And there are some who derive it from the word <hi>Koning,</hi> which signifies a King; and <hi>Staple,</hi> which signifies a Hold, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause some Constables were Commanders of the Kings Houses: But I find that the High Constable did command the Kings Armies, but was expresly debarred from commanding either His Houses or Garrisons; as <hi>L'oiseau</hi> well observes, <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. Because, says he, It was a great power that one man should command both the Army, and the Garrisons: The Badge of his Office was, and is a naked Sword, which in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire was the Badge of the Office, <hi>Praefecti Praetorio</hi>; and <hi>Trajan</hi> giving the naked Sword to <hi>Suro Licinius,</hi> who was his <hi>Praefectus Praetorio,</hi> gave it with these words,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:51654:31"/>
                  <hi>Pro me si mereor in me</hi>; Which words were thereafter put by <hi>Buchanan,</hi> with a naked Sword upon the Money, Coined during the Minority of King <hi>Iames</hi> the sixth. The Constable with Us, was by the Laws of King <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colm cap.</hi> 6. Judge to all Crimes committed within twelve Miles to the Kings House or Habitation; Though <hi>Skeen</hi> observes, that the best Manuscripts bear only two Leagues: But now his Jurisdiction is only exercised either as to Crimes or otherwise, during the time of Parliament, which some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend likewise to all general Conventions.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Marischal</hi> is a <hi>German</hi> word and Office originally, as the Learned <hi>Tillet</hi> proves fully, <hi>a Marker of Camps</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Ax which he bears as the Badge of his Office, was that Instrument wherewith he did break the Ground, though now this part of his Office is delegated to the <hi>Marischal du Camp.</hi> The Marischal commanded the Horse as <hi>Tillet</hi> proves, whereas the Constable commanded both: But yet our Learned <hi>Craig</hi> calls the Constable onely <hi>Praefectus Equitum</hi>; And yet as <hi>Tillet</hi> observes, the Marischal was not under the Constable, else he could not be an Officer of the Crown: For it is es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential to all Officers of the Crown, and Officers of State, to depend upon none but the King. Of old I find the Orders in Military cases run, to Our Constable and Marischal.</p>
               <p>The Office of Marischal has never been out of the Family of <hi>Keith:</hi> But the Earls of <hi>Athol</hi> and several others have been Constables of <hi>Scotland</hi>; And therefore it is that the Earl <hi>Marischal</hi> hath no other Title; But the High Constable designs himself Earl of <hi>Errol.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We had no Knight <hi>Marischal</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> till King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firsts <hi>Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> in <hi>anno</hi> 1633. at which time it was Erected by a Letter to the Privy Council; by his Office he is to take place immediately after the younger Sons of Lords.</p>
               <p>The Thesaurer is not mentioned amongst these Officers of the Crown under King <hi>Malcolm Keanmore,</hi> and of old it has been thought but an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Kings House; For in a Confirmation granted to the Abbacy of <hi>Aberbrothick,</hi> in <hi>anno</hi> 1529. by King <hi>Iames</hi> the fifth, after <hi>Reverendissimis Episcopis,</hi> and <hi>dilectis consanguineis,</hi> are enumerate as Witnesses, <hi>dilectis Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliaribus nostris</hi> Roberto Barton, <hi>nostro Thesaurario &amp; Computorum nostrorum Rotulatore</hi>: Nor do I find a Thesaurer designed as Witness in any of the Kings Charters till then, though some foolishly think that <hi>Panetarius</hi> was Thesaurer. And though the word <hi>Familiar Counsellour</hi> be now given to all Officers of State, who are not Earls, because they cannot be called <hi>Cousins</hi>; Yet of old it was only given to those of the Kings own Family, and was derived <hi>à Familia,</hi> though now Familiar is thought to be the same with Intimate.</p>
               <p>Till of late, Thesaurer, Comptroller, and Collector of the Augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were three different Offices, but now they are all joyned in one: Comptroller is in the old Registers called <hi>Rotulator.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Thesaurer takes now place, as second Officer of State, next to the Chancellor; Next to the Thesaurer is the President of the Privy-Council; After him the Privy-Seal; but the Secetary is only first of his own Rank, that is, if a Duke, the first Duke, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of old the Secretary was a very Honourable Imployment; For as <hi>Cassio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>opist.</hi> 4. well observes, <hi>Honor hic datur egregiis, dum ad Imperiale Secretum, tales constat elegi, in quibus reprehensionis vitium non potest inveniri.</hi>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:51654:31"/>
But yet I find the Secretary onely named in the former Confirmation, <hi>inter Familiares:</hi> Of old I find he was Stiled, <hi>Clericus Regis,</hi> though some Interpret this <hi>Clericus Regis,</hi> to be either Clerk-Register, or the Kings Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor, and Clerk to His Closet, and some that he was <hi>Almoner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have no Master of Requests now, that charge being swallowed up by the Secretaries Office; Their Office with Us was, as at <hi>Rome,</hi> To represent to the King the complaints of the People, <hi>Referendarii</hi> says <hi>Cassiodor. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>dolores alienos asserunt, conquerentium vota satiant, &amp; per eos Iudices corriguntur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I find that <hi>Advocatus Fisci,</hi> now Our Kings Advocat, or Atturney-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, was dignified with the Title of <hi>Comes,</hi> which is now Earl, <hi>l. jubenius i. de Advoc. divers. jud.</hi> and with the Titles of <hi>Clarissimus &amp; Spectabiles,</hi> which was only bestowed on the chief Nobility, <hi>l.</hi> 4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6. <hi>eod. tit.</hi> and from this seems to have flowed Our calling them Lord Advocat; And the <hi>French</hi> calling them <hi>Messire,</hi> which Title only the Chancellor and Advocat there get: Upon this Officer, <hi>Rome</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Claudius</hi> the Emperour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed so much Honour, that he said, <hi>Tantum Honoris &amp; Authoritatis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessisse procuratori</hi> Caesaris, <hi>ut eum suis Legibus adaequaverit, volueritque ut quod ipse statuisset perinde ratum esset, ac si ab ipso foret constitutum:</hi> And of old they were still of the Order of Knights; for <hi>Tacitus</hi> in the life of <hi>Agricola,</hi> says, <hi>utrumque avum procuratorem</hi> Caesaris <hi>habuit quae equestris Nobilitas est.</hi> The Kings Advocat is with Us, as in <hi>France, Consiliarius Natus,</hi> that is to say, is by vertue of his Office a Privy Counsellor, in a more peculiar way than the rest: For I find by the Records of Council in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> time, that the Register and Justice-Clerk are expresly mentioned in the Commission of Council, but the Advocat is in all the Sederunts, though he be not named in the Commission. And though with Us it was not allowed to the Kings Advocat, till Sir <hi>Thomas Hope</hi>'s time, that he should be present at the Lords advising of Causes, where the Advocat was himself Interested; Yet I conceive, in Causes which he pleads meerly upon the Kings Account, he ought to be present even when the Cause is advising: This was allowed <hi>Advocato Fisci,</hi> for <hi>Trajan</hi> writing to <hi>Plinius,</hi> Commands <hi>eos adhibere in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silium à Praesidibus cum de causa Fiscali agitur,</hi> which explains very well, <hi>L.</hi> 7. <hi>de Iur Fisc.</hi> Where <hi>si Fiscus alicui status controversiam faciat, Fisci Advocatus adesse debet, quare si sine Fisci Advocato pronunciatum sit divus Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus rescripsit, nihil esse actum &amp; ideo ex integro cognosci opportere</hi>: Of which Office the Learned <hi>Budeus</hi> gives this Character, <hi>Magistratus is est in quem omnes suas actiones, Princeps, Populus, universi transcripserunt, asylum Legum, arx Iustitiae, innocentiae vim passae, aut Iudicio circumventae, propugnaculum, intercessor rerum malarum, suasor rerum bonarum, praesentis semper animi, Actor, &amp; Defensor, de sententia Iuris &amp; Equitatis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I find, that though <hi>per</hi> L. <hi>nemo</hi> C. <hi>de assessor.</hi> no man can be both a Judge and Advocat, yet the Kings Advocats in <hi>France</hi> have been allowed to be Judges at the same time they were Advocats; for it was thought that the Office of Kings Advocat, did naturally participate both of the Judge and Advocat, and so was not inconsistent with the Imployment of a Judge, <hi>l. ult. c. de Advocat. Fisc.</hi> and this was so decided by the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> in <hi>Iune</hi> 1605. And from this We probably in <hi>Scotland</hi> took occasion, a little after that time, to make Sir <hi>William Oliphant,</hi> and of late Sir <hi>Iohn Nisbet,</hi> both Advocats and Lords of the Session.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:51654:32"/>The <hi>Almoner</hi> with Us has no Precedency for ought I know, though in <hi>France, Le grand Aumosnier</hi> is thought to be an Officer of the Crown: He is very oft a Witness in all Our Charters granted be Our Kings, and some think that <hi>Clericus noster</hi> was <hi>Almoner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I find that <hi>Cockburn</hi> of <hi>Lanton,</hi> who was also <hi>custos magni Sigilli,</hi> in the second year of King <hi>Robert</hi> the thirds Reign, is made heretable <hi>Ostiarius nostri Parliamenti,</hi> that is to say, Usher of the Parliament. The <hi>Lyon</hi> and he does Debate who shall go next to the King, or His Commissioner, in Parliament and Conventions, The Usher pretending, that if he behoov'd to go after the <hi>Lyon,</hi> he behooved to go before the Heraulds, and so he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooved to walk between the <hi>Lyon</hi> and his Brethren, which were not decent, (though both in <hi>England,</hi> and with Us, I find, that several Degrees of Persons do in all Processions, walk between the <hi>Garter</hi> or <hi>Lyon</hi> and his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren Heraulds;) Likeas, it is implyed in the nature of the Ushers office, that he should immediately usher him to whom he is Usher; but in <hi>England,</hi> I find, that at the Cavalcad, when His <hi>Majesty</hi> entred <hi>London,</hi> in <hi>anno</hi> 1660. and at His Coronation, <hi>Garter</hi> King of Arms did walk in the midst, having the Mayor of <hi>London</hi> on his left hand, and the Knight of the Black-Rod on his right: And the Author of <hi>Les Memoirs des Ambassadeur</hi> tells Us, that in <hi>anno</hi> 1629. at the Procession, for Celebration of that solemn Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> the King of Arms did walk immediately before the <hi>French</hi> King, <hi>Le Roy d'armes marchant immediatement devant Le Roy.</hi> I am likewise informed, that in <hi>England,</hi> the Precendency runs thus, King of Arms, Usher of the Black-Rod, Master of Ceremonies, and after him the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Privy-Chamber, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Title of Duke came from <hi>Dux,</hi> a Leader and Commander of an Army, and was at first a Title of Office, but now is a Dignity given by Kings and Princes, to men of Blood and good Merit; And with Us, the Prince of <hi>Scotland</hi> (as is already said) is Duke of <hi>Rothesay.</hi>

               <p>The word Marquess was first appropriate to the Lords of the <hi>Marches</hi> and <hi>Frontiers,</hi> but is since become a Title of special Dignity betwixt a Duke and Earl.</p>
               <p>Earl came from the <hi>Saxon</hi> word <hi>Ear-ethel,</hi> which was abridged to <hi>Ear-el,</hi> and afterwards by Abbreviation <hi>Earl,</hi> with the <hi>Dutch</hi> called <hi>Eorle</hi>; and at this day the <hi>Germans</hi> use the word <hi>Grave</hi> for it: They are in <hi>Latine</hi> called <hi>Comites</hi> with Us, because in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, <hi>Comitatus</hi> was called the Court of the <hi>Prince, l.</hi> 43. <hi>de Testament. Militar. l.</hi> 13. <hi>ff. de re Militar.</hi> and those who attended the Emperor were called <hi>Comites,</hi> or his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions: They were appointed to be Governours of the several Countrys of the Empire, which were from them called <hi>Comitatus</hi> or Counties, and Earls are to this day designed Earls of such a Shire; But the Kings thereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, being desirous to have their Subjects depending immediately upon themselves, did appoint Sheriffs in their place to command the Counties, who are therefore still called <hi>Vice-comites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some were likewise appointed to command Towns, and so these <hi>Comites Vrbium,</hi> were of a meaner Degree, than the <hi>Comites Provinciarum</hi>; But now Earls who have their Designations from Towns, are in the same De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with those who have their Designations from Provinces.</p>
               <p>Counts <hi>Palatine</hi> were such as had Office in the Kings <hi>Palace,</hi> and had their name <hi>à Palatio,</hi> as is clear by the whole Titles, <hi>C. de Palavinis sacrar.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:51654:32"/>
Largit. &amp; tit. de Castren. Palatinorum peculio</hi>: But it is fit to know that these Counts <hi>Palatin,</hi> or Officers of the Palace differed in the <hi>Roman</hi> Law from <hi>Domestici,</hi> for the <hi>Domestici</hi> these were properly and onely those who were of the Emperours guards, as is clear, by <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>c. de Protect. &amp; Domest.</hi> and <hi>Cujac.</hi> upon that law. The Counts <hi>Palatin</hi> in <hi>England</hi> were such as had Regal power within their own Jurisdictions, nor do I in my reading find any Counts <hi>Palatin</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> save <hi>Walterus Palatinus de Stratherne,</hi> who designs himself <hi>Atholiae &amp; Cathaniae Comes</hi>; he gives his lands of <hi>Cortowhy</hi> to the Bishop of <hi>Brichen,</hi> in <hi>anno</hi> 1429. And I believe the Reason why We have so few Counts <hi>Palatin</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> is, because Our Lords of Regality have the same power; But properly the Officers of the Kings house are onely now what the <hi>Comites Palatini</hi> were of old.</p>
               <p>For Regulating the Precedency amongst Earles and Lords with Us, K. <hi>Iames</hi> the 6. did grant a Commission to some Noblemen in <hi>March</hi> 1606. who upon Citation did pronunce the following Decreit, according to which Decreit these Noblemen are at present Ranked, and if any of the Noblemen therein prejudged do Reclaim, they use to raise a Reduction of the said Decreit before the Session, and Adject a Conclusion of Declarator, Craving it may be found and declared that they ought to have Precedency from the Noblemen whom they therein cite:</p>

                           <p>It is fit to know, that the Earl of <hi>Dowglas</hi> was by Act of Parliament, Declared to have the first Vote in Parliament, and the Carrying of the Crown, and leading of the Vanguard; But K. <hi>Iames</hi> did in <hi>anno</hi> 1582. prevail with that Earl, to suffer the Duke of <hi>Lennox</hi> to carry the Crown for that time, and in <hi>anno</hi> 1632. There is a Charter granted to the said Earl in life-rent, and to his Son in Fee, <hi>cum omnibus privilegiis,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>&amp; spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cialiter cum privilegio aciem ducendi, Coronam gerendi.</hi> &amp;c. But in <hi>anno</hi> 1633. the said Earl being Created a Marquess, it is Declared by Act of Council, that he did quite priviledge of having the the first Vote in Parliament, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Promotion; And yet the Marques of <hi>Dowglas</hi> still pretends, that any such Renunciation could not have prejudged the Family, since the Granter of that Renunciation was onely a Life-renter, his son having been in Fee.</p>
                           <p>I find there are some titles of Nobility in <hi>England</hi> annexed to places, so that whoever is in possession of that place, has right to the tittle: Thus it was found in the case of the Lord <hi>Abergavenny,</hi> that he in possession of the Castle, ought to have the title, albeit he be not Heir of Blood. Their Reason is, because it is a Barony-marchiere, and it has been found, that Baronies and Castles situate upon the Borders of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long alwayes to the Owners; the words of the Tenour being <hi>per servitium Patriae custodiendae.</hi> It is alleadged, as one of the Reasons in that caise, that the Owners of lands, holding <hi>in capite &amp; per Baroniam,</hi> have Precedency, albeit they be not next Heirs.</p>
                           <p>The next Degree to the Earles is that of Viscount, in Latin <hi>Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes</hi>; as being of old Lieutenant to an Earl, <hi>Vicecomites, olim dicibantur, quibus castri Dominus Vices suas committebat seu executionem Iurisdictionis.</hi> But afterwards Our King gave not the Government of Counties, or Shires, to
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:51654:34"/>
Earles, but appointed Sheriffs who depended upon their own Nomination; and were therefore called <hi>Vicecomites.</hi> In <hi>Bretagn</hi> Barons take place from Viscounts; But there are no Viscounts in <hi>Germany, Bourgrave</hi> being in their place, <hi>Speculat. tit. de Vicecometatu &amp; la Roque de nobilit. C.</hi> 83. We had no Viscounts in <hi>Scotland</hi> before 1606. for by the aforesaid Decreet the Lord is declared next to the Earl.</p>
                           <p>Barons according to <hi>Spelman, sunt Clientes Feodales, &amp; Vassalli Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tales, qui Pagos, Vrbes, Castra, vel eximiam ruris portionem, cum Iurisdictione acceperunt a Rege</hi>; And the word according to him comes from <hi>Vir</hi> or <hi>Vi,</hi> i. e. <hi>robur belli</hi>: But it is more probable that it comes from the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, <hi>gravis,</hi> they being chosen wise, and Discreet men. With Us, all are called Barons who hold their lands of the King <hi>in libera Baronia,</hi> and who have power of pit and gallows; and of old they were all heritable Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Parliament, as all Barons in <hi>England</hi> are, as is clear by <hi>Act</hi> 52. <hi>Parl.</hi> 3. <hi>Ia.</hi> 1. whereby all Barons are appointed to come to Parliament; and though this Act may seem to be abrogated by the 101. <hi>Act, Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> 7. <hi>Iames</hi> the first, whereby the Barons of each Shire are allowed to choose two wise men to Represent them, which is the custom at this day; Yet it is observable, that though by that Act they may for their conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency choose two, yet they are by no express Law discharged to come in greater numbers: And by the 78. <hi>Act Par.</hi> 6. <hi>Ia.</hi> 4. no Baron that had below the Rent of 1OO. Merks, was to be compelled to come to Parliament, unless the King particularly wrote for him. And when Taxations were laid on by the Council, I find by the old Records, as particularly in <hi>October</hi> 1562. that Noblemen and Burgesses are called, but no Barons: the Barons and Noblemen having been then represented promiscuously, and that long after the Act of Parliament, allowing them to send Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners. And this is the Reason, why Our old Barons, who are not Lords, and hold onely their lands in free Barony, have <hi>supporters</hi> in their Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and that with some reluctancy they yeeld the Precedency to Knights-Baronets, they being Originally heritable Counsellours to the King as Members of Parliament, and not Debarred. The several Degrees of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility before Treated of, did alwayes bear their respective Coronets, as in <hi>England,</hi> excepting the Lords, who had no Coronet till the year 1665. There being a Warrand under His <hi>Majesties</hi> hand, in <hi>Iune</hi> 1665. Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Barons or Lords of Parliament in <hi>Scotland,</hi> a certain Crimson Velvet Cape, with a Golden Circle, decored with six Pearles on the Top, equally distant one from another, which is the same with the Barons Coronet in <hi>England:</hi> But the figure of this Coronet on the margine of the principal Signator, is done far contrare to the words in the Body; The same having points like to that of the Earles, which has certalnly been a mistake and ignorance in the Painter, and ought to be adverted to be the Lyon, and Heraulds: This Warrand is Registrat in the books of Council, and in the Lyon Books.</p>

               <p>This is the Precedency stated by the present Rolls of Parliament, albeit it is not acquiesced in by all the Nobility: For the Earl of <hi>Sutherland</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends with all the Earles who are ranked before him, and generally such as are dissatisfied with these Rolls, do protest whilst the Rolls are called, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst such as they conceive are unjustly ranked before them. Sometimes also the Son has a different Precedency, from what was possessed by his Father; As the Earl of <hi>Lothian,</hi> who now as succeeding to his great Grand-father by the Mother, comes to have his Precedency next to the Earl of <hi>Wigton,</hi> though his Father taking place by a new Patent was ranked as in the above written Rolls. The Justice General pretends to
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:51654:36"/>
the same precedency with the Lord Chief Justice of the Kings Bench in <hi>England,</hi> by a report made by the Lord Thesaurer in the Kings name, the 17. <hi>Iune</hi> 1637. but neither is the Letter to which this report relates extant, nor has he been in possession since. And it is fit to observe, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of what is said before, <hi>page</hi> 42. (by a Servants mistake) that the Lord Privy-seal takes place with us as in <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>The Order of Baronet in <hi>Scotland</hi> was erected for advancing the Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>Nova Scotia</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> and for settling a Colony there, to which the Aid of these Knights was Designed. The Order was onely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended be K. <hi>Ia.</hi> 6. before his Death, for in his first Charter of <hi>Nova Scotia,</hi> in favours of Sir <hi>William Alexander,</hi> 10. <hi>Septem.</hi> 1621. And in another Charter granted to Sir <hi>Robert Gordon</hi> of <hi>Lochinvar</hi> of a part of <hi>Nova Scotia,</hi> Designed the Barony of <hi>Galloway,</hi> 8. <hi>Novem.</hi> 1621. there is no mention made of this Order: So that the same was onely erected by K. <hi>Charles</hi> 1. <hi>anno</hi> 1625. In the several Patents granted to Baronents, His <hi>Majesty</hi> did dispone to each of these Knights a certain portion of land in <hi>Nova Scotia,</hi> erecting the same in a free Barony with great and ample priviledges, unnecessary to be insert here. And moreover, for their encouragement, did Erect, Creat, Make, Constitute, and Ordain that Heritable State, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, Dignity, Name, Order, Title, and Stile of <hi>Baronet,</hi> to be enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed be every of these Gentlemen who did hazard for the good and increase of that Plantation: And so preferred them to that Order and Title, Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them and their Heirs Male heritable Baronets in all time coming, with the Place, Preeminency, Priority, and Precedency in all Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, Breeves, Letters-patents, Namings, and Writes, and in all Sessions, Conventions, Congregations and places, at all times and occasions what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somever before all Knights, called <hi>Aequites aurati,</hi> all lesser Barons com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called <hi>Lairds,</hi> and before all other Gentlemen: Excepting Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Alexander</hi> His Majesties Lieutenant of <hi>Nova Scotia,</hi> who (with his Heir, their Wives and Children conform) is not onely excepted in each of these Letters-patents granted to the Knights, his Consorts; But likewise the Charter granted to himself be King <hi>Charles</hi> 1. 1625. did bear expresly this exception and provision: As also, excepting Knights-Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerets who should be Created under the Royal Standard in His Majesties Army, and in open War, the King himself being present, and that dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Bannerets lifetime onely: And with Precedency before all of the same Order whose Patents are of a posteriour date. His Majesty did more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over Declare, and Ordain, That the Wives of these Knights, and of their Heirs Male, should have the Precedency aswell after as before the deaths of their Husbands, if they should happen to survive, before the Wives of all those of whom the Knights, Baronets, and their Heirs Male had the Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deny, and even before the Wives of Knights-Bannerets before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted; (the Degree of Baronet being heritable) And also that the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren Male and Female of the Baronets, should take place before the Bairns Male and Female respectively, of all persons of whom the Baronets and their Heirs Male had the Priority: And likewise before the Children of the Bannerets; and that the Wives of the Sons of the Baronets, and of their Heirs Male, should preceed the Wives of all persons whom their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands might preceed, and that aswell their Husbands being dead as living. And further, His <hi>Majesty</hi> did Declare, and Promise, That whensoever
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:51654:36"/>
the eldest Sons and appearand Heirs Male of the Baronets should attain to the Age of twenty one years, they should be by His <hi>Majesty</hi> and his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours created, <hi>Equites aurati,</hi> or Knights Batchelours, without payment of any Fies or Dues for the same, providing they should desire it. But here it is to be observed, that some of the eldest Sons of Baronets pretend to the title of <hi>Knight</hi> at their Majority, be vertue of this clause, without any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious desire or dubbing, which certainly is an errour, for if they will not be at the pains to desire it of His <hi>Majesty,</hi> or His Commissioner, they should not assume it. Likeas His <hi>Majesty</hi> did Declare and Ordain, That the Baronets and their Heirs Male should as an additament of Honour to their Armorial Ensigns, bear either on a <hi>Canton</hi> or <hi>Inescutcheon</hi> in their option, the Ensign of <hi>Nova Scotia</hi> being <hi>argent,</hi> a cross of St. <hi>Andrew azur,</hi> (the Badge of <hi>Scotland</hi> counterchanged) charged with an <hi>inescutcheon</hi> of the Royal Arms of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>: supported on the <hi>dexter</hi> by the Royal Unicorn, and on the <hi>sinister,</hi> by a Savage or Wild-man <hi>proper:</hi> and for the <hi>crest</hi> a branch of Laurel, and a Thistle issuing from two hands conjoyned, the one being armed, the other naked, with this Ditto, <hi>Munit haec &amp; altera vincit.</hi> And that they and their Heirs Male should in all time coming have place in all His <hi>Majesties</hi> and His Successours Armies in the middle Battel, near and about the Royal Standard for defence thereof. And that they and their Heirs Male may have two Attenders of the Body for bearing up the Pale, one principal Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and four Assistants, at their Funerals; And that they should be always Called, Intituled, and Designed be the name and title of <hi>Baronet,</hi> and that in all <hi>Scottish</hi> Speeches and writings, the addition of <hi>Sir,</hi> and in all other discourses and writings, a word signifying the same should be preponed to their names and other titles, and that the stile and title of <hi>Baronet</hi> should be postponed and subjoyned thereto in all Letters-patents, and other writes whatsomever, as a necessar addition of Dignity, and that each of them should be intituled, <hi>Sir A. B. Baronet,</hi> and his, and his Sons Wives, should enjoy the stile, title, and appellation of <hi>Lady, Madam,</hi> and <hi>Dame,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectively, according to the usual phrase in speaking and writing. And also His <hi>Majesty</hi> did thereby promise, That the number of the Baronets aswell in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as the new Colony of <hi>Nova Scotia</hi> should never exceed the number of 150. (albeit this number is at present somewhat augmented) and did likewise Declare, That He nor His Successours should never Create, nor Erect in time coming any other Dignity, Degree, Stile, Name, Order, Title, or State, nor should give the Priority or Precedency to any Person or Persons, under the Stile, Degree, and Dignity of a Lord of Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which should be, or should be presumed to be Higher, Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, or Equal to that of Baronet: And that the Baronet should have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to take place before any such who should happen to be created of any such degree or order; and that their Wives, Sons, Daughters, and Sons Wives should have their places accordingly: And that if any question or doubt should arise anent their places and prerogatives, the same should be decided and judged according to these Laws and Customs, by which other degrees of Heritable Dignities have their priviledges cognosced and determined. And finally, that none should be created Baronet, either of <hi>Scotland</hi> or <hi>Nova Scotia,</hi> till he had first fulfilled the conditions designed by His <hi>Majesty</hi> for the good and increass of that Plantation, and until he had certified the same to the King by His <hi>Majesties</hi> Lieutenant there.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:51654:37"/>These Patents were ratified in Parliament, and were always of this form till the selling of <hi>Nova Scotia</hi> to the <hi>French,</hi> after which time they were made much shorter, and granted in general terms with all the Priviledges, Precedencies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the former Baronets. And in the year 1629. His <hi>Majesty</hi> did allow these Baronets a particular cognisance, which will be best known by the coppy of the following Letter direct be his <hi>Majesty,</hi> K. <hi>Charles</hi> the first, to the Privy Council here.</p>

               <p>The order of Baronet in <hi>England</hi> was erected by King <hi>Iames</hi> the sixth, for advancing the plantation of <hi>Vlster</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and these Knights have Priviledges and Precedencie much like to those above set down; and there being a Contraversy for Precedency betwixt them and the younger sons of Viscounts, and Barons, managed in presence of King <hi>Iames,</hi> it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined in favours of the younger sons of Viscounts and Barons; But at the same time it was declared, That such Bannerets as should be made by His <hi>Majesty</hi> or Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> under the Kings Standard, displayed in an Army Royal, As also, the Knights of the Garter, Privy Counsellours, Master of the Court of Wards and Liveries, Chancellour and Under-Thesaurer of the Exehequer Chancellour of the Dutchy, Chief Justice of the Kings Bench, Master of the Rolls, Chief Justice of the Common-pleas, Chief Barons of Exchequer, and other Judges, and Barons of the degree of the Coif, should have place and precedency both before the younger sons of Viscounts, and Barons, and before all Baronets: by which some altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may appear from the Ranking appointed by <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth.</p>
               <p>Beside what has been formerly observed in the description of Knights, Baronets. I find that of old a Banneret (or a Ban-rent) has been with us a title higher than a Baron, for by <hi>Act</hi> 101. <hi>Parl.</hi> 7. <hi>Ia.</hi> 1. Barons may choose their own Commissioners, but Bishops, Dukes, Earles, Lords, and Ban-rents are to be summonded to Parliament by the Kings special precept; And it is probable that these Ban-rents were Knights of extraordinary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, who were allowed to raise a company of men under their own Banner, but now it is commonly taken for such as are Knighted by the King or Prince under the Royal Standard in time of War. But I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that those could not now sit in Parliament upon the Kings precept, the former Act of Parliament being <hi>in desuetude:</hi> They have the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency from Baronets, though their Wives have not, this being but a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary Dignity, and the other an heritable.</p>
               <p>Barons in <hi>England</hi> are Lords with us, but a Baron with us is properly he who has power of pit and gallows; And yet of old I conceive that Lords and Barons were the same, for the Statutes of K. <hi>Robert</hi> 1. bear to be made in his Parliament holden at <hi>Scoon,</hi> with Bishops, Abbots, Priors, Earles, Barons, and others his Noblemen of his Realm: And in Our old Original Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I find that the Lords and Barons are put in one column undistin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished and under the common name Barons; And in the first Parliament of K. <hi>Ia.</hi> the 4th. I find the Master of <hi>Glames,</hi> i. e. the Lord <hi>Glames,</hi> eldest son sitting <hi>inter Barones.</hi> Now the Lords are called the Great Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, and the rest are called Small Barons, in the 101. <hi>Act.</hi> 7. <hi>Parl. Ia.</hi> 1. and ever since; But yet I find by the 166. <hi>Act.</hi> 13. <hi>Parl. Ia.</hi> 6. every Earl or Lord payes 2000. pounds, for Lawborrows, and every great Baron 1000. pounds; but by great Baron there is meant a Baron of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:51654:38"/>
estate, because that Act was to proportion the Surety to be found to the estate of him who finds the Surety.</p>
               <p>The old Barons (or Lairds) amongst us especially where they are Chiefs of Clans, or the Representatives of old Families that were Earldoms, as <hi>Pitcurr</hi> is of the Earl of <hi>Dirleton,</hi> and as Chief of the name of <hi>Halyburton,</hi> have never ceded the Precedency to Knights-Baronets, much less to ordinar Knights. Though the other pretend that a Baron is no name of Dignity, and that Knights-Baronets have a special priviledge, that there shall be no degree betwixt them and Lords, except the Bannerets; And though <hi>militia non est per se dignitas, Chassan. fol.</hi> 344. yet generally it is believed, that next to Knights-Baronets succeed Knights-Batchelours, and next to them our Lairds, or Landed-Gentlemen, though a Laird in effect is but the corrupt word of a Lord.</p>

               <p>In Towns, These who inhabit Cities are preferred to such as inhabit Burghs, and generally those in the Metropolitan, or capital. City are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to all the rest: And those who have born Magistracy, are even when their Magistracy is over, preferred to all others. And so far is this Precedency observed, that 1<hi rend="sup">o.</hi> A younger Alderman or Bailie takes not Precedency from his Senior, because he is Knighted, or as being the elder Knight, as was found in the case of the Alderman <hi>Craven,</hi> who though all the rest of the Alderman were Knighted at the Coronation of King <hi>Iames,</hi> kept the precedency formerly due to him as Senior Alderman. But though this hold not onely amongst Aldermen, but that even all Knights of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, being Burgesses of a Town, do cede to these who have been their Magistrates in it, as to publick meetings relating to the Town; Yet it is doubted whether such a Knight will be oblieged to give place to an Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, or Baily in a neutral place. But it is determined in the Heraulds Office of <hi>England,</hi> that all such as have been Mayors of <hi>London,</hi> that is to say, Provosts with us, do take the place of all Knights-batchelours every where, because they have been the Kings Lieutenants.</p>
               <p>It is there likewlse remarked, That Sir <hi>Iohn Crook</hi> Serjeant at Law, was Knighted before any other Serjeant his Ancient, and standing upon Precedency by reason of his Knighthood, It was adjudged against him by the Judges, <hi>viz.</hi> that he should take place according to his Serjeancy, and not after his Knighthood, yet his wife took her place of a Lady before other Serjeants wives.</p>
               <p>The Members of Courts do take place amongst themselves according to the precedency of the Courts, where they serve; as the Clerks of the Privy Council take place of the Clerks of the Session.</p>
               <p>In Families likewise, the Chief of the Family takes place of any Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the Family: And though generally it be believed, that Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have no precedency one from another, yet Reason and Discretion do allow that a Gentlman of three Generations, should cede to a Gentleman of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:51654:38"/>
ten, if there be not a very great disparity betwixt their Fortunes, and that for the same Reason almost, that a Gentleman of three Generations claims precedency from any ordinary Landed-man, who was newly acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his lands.</p>

            <head>CHAP. IX. The Precedency due to Women.</head>
            <p>WOmen before their Marriage have Precedency by their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but there is this difference betwixt them and the Male-children, that the same Precedency is due to all the Daughters that is due to the eldest, though it is not so amongst Sons; and the reason of the difference seems to be, that Daughters would all succeed equally, whereas the eldest Son excludes all the rest; But if this be the adequat and true reason, then where the Estate and Honours are provided to the eldest Daughter onely, excluding the rest, they ought not to have the same Precedency that the eldest Sister has. And therefore I ascribe this difference rather to the custome of Nations meerly founded upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect due to that Sex.</p>
            <p>During the Marriage, the Wife regularly participats of the condition of her Husband by the Civil Law, and Law of Nations, <hi>L.</hi> 3. <hi>C. de Dignitat. Mulieres Honore maritorum erigimus, genere nobilitamus,</hi> and since she was to be sharer in his misfortunes, the Law thought it just that she should be sharer in his Advantages; And the Wife by the Canon Law is called <hi>Socia divinae &amp; humanae domus,</hi> and <hi>L. Foeminae, ff. de Senat.</hi> it is said, that <hi>Foemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis dignitatem clarissimam mariti tribuunt</hi>: But yet this rule has some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, for though in <hi>France</hi> the wives of those who have their Dignities by Offices, enjoy the same Precedency with their Husband, together with a communication of his title, and thus they say there, <hi>Madam la Chanceliere, Madam la Praesidente</hi>: Yet it is not so with us, who think, that Offices are bestowed on Husbands upon a personal account, which is not communicable to their Wives; and yet in some Temporary Dignities, such as that of a Knight-batchelour, the Wife participates of the Husbands title and prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency: Though I find by the Heraulds Records, that this proceeded ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally, rather from Courtesie than from Law, and that of old a Knights wife enjoyed onely his Honours during the Spousals, nor were they to be called in Law <hi>Dame Alice,</hi> or <hi>Dame Catherine, &amp;c.</hi> after the Marriage was dissolved.</p>
            <p>By our Law likewise, If a woman have Precedency by her Birth, or Descent, she retains still the same, notwithstanding she marry a person of inferiour dignity, contrare to the Rules of the ivil Law; And thus if the Heiress of a Dutchie, or Earldom, marry a Gentleman, she has still the precedency due to a Duke, or Earl, albeit by the Civil Law, <hi>L.</hi> 8. <hi>de Senat.</hi>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:51654:39"/>
it be exprest that <hi>Parentes donee Plebeiis nuptiis fuerint copulatae, &amp;c.</hi> the reason whereof is as <hi>Faber</hi> observes upon that Law, because it were most absurd that the Wife should have more dignitie then her Husband; and thus <hi>Livius</hi> observes, that <hi>Virginia</hi> daughter to a <hi>Patrician,</hi> or noble <hi>Roman,</hi> was debarred from the Honours due to her Birth, because she had married a <hi>Plebeian</hi>; And it seems indeed that he being her Head, it is most unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural that any part should be more honourable then the Head: Nor can there be any thing more contrare to that superiority, given both by the Law of <hi>GOD</hi> and Man to Husbands, nor any means fitter to make a Wife despise her Husband than this is. But I think this precedency has arisen from the Feudal Law, for the wife having once a noble Fee, she cannot forfeit the same by her Marriage, and therefore she must retain the dignity that is annexed to it, which is incommunicable to her Husband, because he is not in Fie. But it is observable, that if the daughter of a Nobleman marry another Nobleman, she will lose the precedency due to her by her Birth, though she would not have losed it if she had married a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and the reason of this seems to be, because by marrying a Nobleman she receives another Feudal dignity, which suppresses the first.</p>
            <p>I find it observed in Judge <hi>Cook. lib.</hi> 12. <hi>fol.</hi> 112. that if a Baron dies, having divers daughters, the King may conferr upon either of them the title; And thus the Lord <hi>Cromwel</hi> having died without heirs Male, <hi>Burchier</hi> who married the youngest daughter was made Lord <hi>Cromwel,</hi> of which we have no example in <hi>Scotland</hi>; for by our Law, if the title descend to Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males by the Patent, the eldest onely can succeed to the title, but if it descend not by the Patent to Heirs Female, then the King may admit nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the title, or either as he pleases.</p>
            <p>After the Husbands decease, the Wife did by the Civil Law enjoy her Husbands precedency during her Widowity, but if she marry to a person of inferiour quality, she loses that Precedency, <hi>L.</hi> 8. <hi>de Senat.</hi> which holds with Us and in <hi>England</hi>; And yet sometimes the King allows her the same Precedency, by a Letter, as he does also to the daughters of Dukes, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who have lost their Precedency by Marriage, which Letters, or Warrands, are direct to the Heraulds Office, and Registrated there. And the Queen never loses her former Dignity though she marry the meanest person after the Kings death. And generally, all the priviledges due to the King, are communicated to the Queen, <hi>per L.</hi> 31. <hi>ff. de Leg: Augusta, autem Legibus soluta non est, Principes tamen eadem illi privilegia tribunut quae ipsi habent.</hi> Notwithstanding whereof, Lawyers think that her Bastards are not Noble as the Bastards of Kings, nor does the Womb ever nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litate. The Countrey of <hi>Campaigne</hi> in <hi>France</hi> onely excepted, where it is sufficient that either the Father or Mother be Noble, which was allowed to the Ladies of that Countrey, upon the killing of all the Nobility at a great fight, <hi>Papon. de Nobles. num.</hi> 3. By the Civil Law also, a Widow living leudly, loses her former dignity, <hi>Arg. § Fin. in authent. de restit.</hi> but this holds not with us, <hi>vide Bon. de Curt. de Nobilitate, cap.</hi> 12. <hi>num.</hi> 194.</p>
            <p>It has been doubted, whether a mean woman marrying a Nobleman, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the priviledge due to her by her Husband, who has been degraded by forfeiture, or otherwayes, and <hi>Corbin</hi> cites a decision, 27. <hi>August.</hi> 1698. whereby it was resolved, that she retains still her former priviledge, since crimes are personal, which is also our Custom.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:51654:39"/>It has been likeways doubted abroad, whether a Noblewoman marrying a <hi>Plebeian,</hi> and thereby losing the Precedency due to her Birth, if she mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a Gentleman in the second Marriage, she will thereby recurr to her first Dignity, the person be whom she lost the first Dignity being dead; And it was found that she will not, for in Law that which is once extinct does not revive; and therefore Women in such cases take Letters of Resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, as they call them, or procure a warrand from the King, for that effect as the custom is with us, <hi>ut interveniet Principis restitutio quae plebeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis maculam abstergat, Traitte de la noblesse, pag.</hi> 324. But there would be no place for this question here, since with us a Noblewoman would not lose her Precedency by marrying a <hi>Plebeian,</hi> but the doubt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoov'd to be thus stated with us, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether a Noblewoman marrying a Nobleman of an inferiour degree, would recover her first dignity, she marrying thereafter a Gentleman: Or, whether a Knight-Baronets Lady marrying a Plebeian, could thereafter recover her dignity if she marry a Gentleman. For I conceive a Knight-baronets Lady, does not like a Noblewoman, retain her Precedency when she marries a person of inferiour quality, and I think neither of them would recover their former dignity without a special Warrand.</p>
            <p>I find that the Commissioners appointed to regulate Queen <hi>Anns</hi> Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, did upon the 20. of <hi>May,</hi> 1619. declare, That the Ladies of the Privy Chamber should in time of mourning, take their places as if the Queen were living, till the Funerals were ended, and that the Queens Chamberers should for the present Funeral go before Countesses women, without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to Countesses women, at any time thereafter.</p>
            <p>It is fit to observe, That the Wives and Daughters of all Dukes, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quesses, Earles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do take the same place that the Husbands and Sons do, conform to the Precedency formerly exprest, <hi>pag.</hi> 35. And I find in the Heraulds Office of <hi>England,</hi> an establishment settled thus amongst women, by <hi>Iasper</hi> Duke of <hi>Bedford,</hi> and other Noblemen, by warrand from <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth.</p>

            <p>From all which it is to be observed, that the wife of the eldest Son of any degree, takes place before the Daughter of that same degree, and both of them take place of the younger Sons wife of the preceeding degree; Thus the Lady of the eldest Son of a Marquess preceeds the Daughter of a Marquess, and both preceed the Ladies of Dukes younger Sons: <hi>Item,</hi> the Wife of the next degree as a Countess, preceeds the Lady of the eldest Son of the preceeding degree as of a Marquess, and the Daughter of a Marquess.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi rend="sup">o.</hi> This holds not only in comparing degrees amongst themselves, but also in comparing Families of the same degree amongst themselves, as for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, though the Marquess of <hi>Dowglas</hi> Lady would give place to the Marquess of <hi>Huntlys</hi> Lady, yet the Wife of the Marquess of <hi>Dowglas</hi> eldest Son would take place from the Marquess of <hi>Huntlys</hi> Daughter.</p>

                  <hi>QVESTION</hi> II. Whether a Kingdom becoming a Common-wealth, or a Common-wealth a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, does their former Precedency remain?</head>
               <p>This Question has two Branches wherein the Difficulties differ,</p>
               <p>The first is, Whether that Town or Place which was a Republick,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:51654:41"/>
having become a Monarchy or Principality, ought it to Retain the Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency due to the former Common-wealth? And that it ought to Retain the same Precedency may be Argued, Because, when one thing is surrogat in the place of another, that which is surrogat ought to have the same priviledge with that in whose place it is surrogat, <hi>surrogatum subit naturam surrogati</hi>; But so it is, that the subsequent Principality is surrogat in place of the former Common-wealth, and therefore ought to have the same Precedency: this Reason is likewise seconded by a Decision of <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, who in the Debate betwixt the Duke of <hi>Florence,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> did prefer the Duke of <hi>Florence,</hi> because the Republick of <hi>Florence</hi> was formerly preferred to <hi>Ferrara.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From this Decision some would distinguish betwixt the Case, where a Citizen of the former Common-wealth is preferred by common consent of his fellow Citizens, in which case they who Governed formerly still Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, Because they choose the new Duke, Prince or King: And the case wherein a Stranger comes in and Conquers, in which case the former Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is absolutely Altered, and none of those who Governed former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly continue to Govern: Nor does the Argument of Surrogation hold in this case, because that Argument onely holds where one thing is surrogat to an other by common consent, and where the Reason of the Priviledge pleaded in the one case remains in the other, neither of which can be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged where there is a Conquest; because there, neither is there a Consent, nor does the Government, nor State remain the same, And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently, ought not to have the same Precedency, seing the sameness of Precedency depends upon the sameness of the State, which ought to have the Precedency.</p>
               <p>The same is likewise to be concluded, where One of the same City or Republick Usurpes the Government; For in that case the former Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments hold: And though <hi>Aristotle libro quinto Politicorum</hi> sayes, <hi>eundem Statum Reipublicae manere, ubi rem suam &amp; summam Res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bublica<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Yet this requires two conditions, The one is, that one of the Citizens Govern; and the other is, That the Government be transmitted to him by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon consent of those his fellow Citizens who Governed formerly; An eminent Example therof We find in that famous <hi>Lex Regia,</hi> mentioned <hi>L.</hi> 1. <hi>ff. de Const. Princ.</hi> whereby the <hi>Romans</hi> transmitted all the power they had to the Emperour, <hi>quae de Imperio lata est qua populus ei &amp; in eum omne suum Imperium &amp; potestatem contulit,</hi> and upon this account it is, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours pretend the same Precedency that was due to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth of <hi>Rome,</hi> since the Common-wealth did surrender and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to them their power.</p>
               <p>The next Branch of the Question is, Whether a Kingdom being turned into a Common-wealth, ought to have the same Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency that was due to the former Kingdom? And it would appear that it ought not, since in becoming a Common-wealth, it is De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded from its former Dignity, Common-wealths being by the consent of all Nations postponed to all Kings, or Crowned-Heads; Nor does the Argument of Surrogation hold in the matter of Precedency, where there is not onely a substantial Alteration, but a Degradation: The former Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:51654:41"/>
of Surrogation does not likewise take place, where there has an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termediate Impediment interveened<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as for Instance, Though <hi>Spain</hi> had been formerly a Kingdom, and though <hi>England</hi> was really a Kingdom of old, yet both these having become afterwards Provinces to the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, they cannot Reassume the Dignities and Precedency due to them before they were subdued, and became Tributaries; since that Degrada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was a <hi>medium impedimentum,</hi> as Lawyers call it, Which hindred the present condition of their Kingdom to be drawn back to its old State: A thousand instances of which may be given in other cases, and even in the matter of Precedency, If a Family be Degraded, and continue so for a long time, if though they be thereafter restored; Or if an Earl should resign his title in the Kings hands, and so extinguish his title, though he were restored, yet he would not be restored to his former Precedency, in prejudice of those who had acquired titles <hi>medio tempore.</hi>

               <p>This question has been often Agitated, and may be of great Use a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst persons of all Degrees: It was first Debated in <hi>anno</hi> 1521. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Ambassadours of <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, who was then Elected Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and the Ambassadours of <hi>Francis</hi> the first King of <hi>France,</hi> who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged, that though <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth was Elected Emperour, yet not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Crowned and Anointed, the Election being but an incompleat Act, could not give him Preference; and that it could not was Argued from these Reasons. 1<hi rend="sup">o.</hi> Before the Emperours Admission and Consecration, he is not called Emperour, but onely King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and therefore he ought not to have the place as Emperour, for the King of the <hi>Romans</hi> is inferiour to the Emperour, and the Inferiour cannot have the Superiours place. 2<hi rend="sup">o.</hi> If Election could give the Precedency, there needed not any further Solemnity; For by the Election, the person Elected would be Emperour, for none can have the Emperours place but the Emperour. 3<hi rend="sup">o.</hi> That which is Imperfect cannot operat as much as that which is perfect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>L.

Notwithstanding of all which, I find that <hi>Gothofred.</hi> and others decide for the Emperour, and are of opinion that an Election has in it the Radical Power and Force of Admission, and so gives as much Precedency as Admission does; Yet with Us, We see that an Elect Bishop takes not the same place, that is due to him after he is Admitted: And therefore the Distinction
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:51654:42"/>
would be made here betwixt such an Election, as transfers all the power that Admission can, as We see in the Emperour, King of <hi>Poland,</hi> and others, who can receive no more Power after they are Elected, and delay their Coronation and other ceremonies for their own conveniencies; And the case of Bishops and inferiour Magistrates, who are oft-times to receive some further power beyond their Election; and so, their Election not being equivalent to an Admission, it gives not the same Precedency that the other can: and therefore I may conclude generally, that Precedency followes Power and Administration.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours have differed in this, for the Eldest and the Latest Emperours did think, that such repeated Elections did augment the Dignity to those who were Elected, and thus <hi>Valentinian novel.</hi> 48. and this was likewise <hi>Hadrians</hi> Opinion, as <hi>Spartianus</hi> Observes in his Life: But <hi>Theodosius</hi> the Younger thought, that these repeated Elections did shew the Merit of him who was Elected, but did not augment his Dignity, <hi>repetiti enim fasces virtutem sepe meritam comprobant, non augent, quia nihil est altius Dignitate, L.</hi> 1. <hi>C. de Consul. vid.

With Us also, I find that One who was been twice or ofter prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be <hi>Provost</hi> or <hi>Mayor,</hi> is preferred to him who has been onely once <hi>Mayor</hi>; and it is Reasonable that they both living in one place, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preferred by those of the same City, should be preferred in Meetings relating to the same City.</p>

                  <hi>QVESTION</hi> V. What Influence has the Conjunction of moe Dignities upon Precedency?</head>
               <p>There are some Lawyers who think, that he who has most Imployments ought to be Preferred to him who was but one: And thus they say, That he who hath two or three Dutchies, or Earldoms, ought to be preferred to him who hath but one, Even as two or three Lights are greater then one, and two or three Cords are stronger then one; And for this they cite <hi>L. Fin Cod. de edict. d. Adrian.</hi> and of this Opinion was <hi>Menochius, Consil.</hi> 902. And for this cause, <hi>Marz. Consil.</hi> 26. thought that the Duke of <hi>Ferrara</hi> ought to be preferred to the Duke of <hi>Florence</hi>; And <hi>Navarrus Consil.</hi> 1. thought that a Cardinal who was a Chancellour ought to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to an elder Cardinal who was not; And that a Doctor of the Civil and Canon Law, ought to be preferred to a meer Doctor of the Civil Law. But yet <hi>Gothofred</hi> is of a contrary Opinion, <hi>cap.</hi> 3. <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. And in Our Practice the greater Dignity is preferred to many lesser Dignities, yea, and the Elder in the same Dignity is preferred to him who was last Promoted to the same Dignity, though he have many lesser Dignities joyned to it; But betwixt two Dignities that are different, if it be not known to which of the Two the Precedency is due, the conjunction of the lesser Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities with the Dignity contraverted ought to prefer; Even as if it were doubted, which of two Bodies weighed most, or which of two Lights shined most, the least addition to either would certainly cast the Ballance and alter the Proportion: But if these many be all Inferiour to one Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they ought not to be preferred, no more then many little Pearles ought to be preferred to a great one; and yet if it be doubted which of two Pearles are of greatest Value, the addition of two or three little ones to either, will raise the Value of that one to which they are thrown in.</p>

               <p>Lawyers give divers instances of this, As first, a Judge is made a Privy Councellour, but thereafter the President of that Court, where he is a Member or Judge, is admitted to be a Privy Councellour; in that case though the other was first admitted to be a Privy Councellour, yet the President, though last admitted, will have the Precedency, and Vot first even in the Privy Council; Because it is indecent, that a Member should have the Precedency, or Vot before his own President: And thus <hi>Papon.</hi> tells Us, it was decided by the Parliament of <hi>Paris, vid. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>tit.</hi> 2. <hi>Art.</hi> 5. which is not unlike what <hi>Vitellius</hi> sayes, <hi>in Tacitus</hi> 19. <hi>Annal.

Theodos. de Consulibus</hi>: and is in Observance with Us, amongst whom the youngest Counsellor, being made an Earl, is preferred to elder Counsellors, and though the elder Counsellor be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after made an Earl, yet the eldest Earl will always be preferred; Though it would seem that upon the first Counsellors being made an Earl, he ought to be preferred, as in the former case where an Extraordinary is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, when he becomes to be in equal Dignity with the prior Ordinary Officer. But the Reason of the Disparity is, because Earles are always to preceed according to their Priority, but Officers are not, An Office being but a thing Temporary, and there being no Difference betwixt an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and Extraordinary Officer, but that the Ordinary has a Sallary, and waits more immediatly upon the King, but yet the Extraordinary Officer was truely of equal Dignity with the Ordinary.

It being pretended, that though he is to have the first Nomination, and the choise of all, yet that should not give his Bailie or Alderman the Precedency, in respect that by the constant Custom observed by all the Burrowes, when many are Elected to be Aldermen or Bailies at once, he who has been formerly a Bailie preceeds always him who was never.</p>

                  <hi>QVESTION</hi> XI. Whether does the apparent Heir his Assuming and Vsing the Title and Precedency of his Predecessor, make him lyable to his Predecessors debts, and Infer a Passive Title against him, as We speak?</head>
               <p>To this it is answered, That it makes him not Lyable, in payment according to the present Curent of Our Decisions, because Honour descends from the King, and is not any lucrative Accession, out of which Debt may be payed, and no man should be made lyable to Debts for enjoying that which cannot pay Debts: Nor does the Son possess this Title by his Father, but by his Family; And Lawyers have resolved that <hi>Filius retinet Nobilitatem etiam repudiata haereditate, Bart. in L. Iurisjur.</hi> § 1. <hi>ff. de Oper. lib. Iac. &amp; in L. si non sortem ff. de condict. in debit.</hi> But yet this decision may seem unsuteable to the Analogy and Principles of Law, For 1<hi rend="sup">o.</hi> Since Honour is by the first Patent and Erection granted to a man and his Heirs, It seems Just and Legal that none can enjoy the same, but such as are Heirs; so that this seems to be a qualified Right granted by the King, and consequently, can be enjoyed by none but such as Purge and Purifie the qualities and are Heirs. 2<hi rend="sup">o.</hi> We see that in other Rights granted to a man and his Heirs, no Successor can have Right with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being Heir, and since this holds in Accessions of the meanest Nature, Why should it not much rather hold in Titles and Dignities which are things of great importance? 3<hi rend="sup">o.</hi> We have no way nor method to know who is Heir, but by an Inquest, after which he who is served Heir is lyable to all Debts, and if he who is to use the Title, needs not be found Heir by an Inquest, any man may use the Title of a Deceist Peer, and if two contended for it, this could not be tryed without an Inquest and Service. 4<hi rend="sup">o.</hi> The making men lyable to their Predecessors Debts for using his Title, would be very advantagious for the Defuncts Creditors, and it is the Interest of the Common-wealth that Creditors should be payed; nor could the apparent Heir complain, since he may choose to use the Title or not as he pleases. 5<hi rend="sup">o.</hi> It were advantagious to the Common-wealth that none had a Title, but he who had the Estate which was given out with it, and out of which it was to be mantained, a Poor Nobility being a great burden upon a Common-wealth and a ruine to it: And I find that the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> did Degrade <hi>George Nevil</hi> from being Duke of <hi>Bedford,</hi> for want of an Estate suteable to his Dignity, which <hi>Statut.</hi> 17. <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. expresses the inconveniencies here mentioned, which are greater in <hi>Scotland</hi> than in <hi>England,</hi> because Our Peers have more Interest
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:51654:45"/>
in laying on Taxes than Lords in <hi>England</hi> have. 6<hi rend="sup">o.</hi> The Law considers not in other cases, whether the thing used by the apparent Heir, may be advantagious to him, Or whether he may pay Debt with it, for the using of meer Ornaments, which can yeeld no Money, Or things of the meanest advantage, do make him lyable, yea, and he would be lyable though he were a looser by the thing he used; whereas not onely are Honours and Precedency things of great Advantage, and which men would buy at any Rate; But if a man have Liberty once to use the Title of his Predecessor, it gives him a great Opportunity to inhance his Predecessors Estate by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct means: And the former Arguments prove onely that the Blood interest as to Honour is transmitted without a Service, but not that the Feudal Title of Earl can be so transmitted.</p>

And generally, whether the Nephew ought to be preferred to the Uncle who was his Fathers second Brother? And I find it Recorded that <hi>Lycurgus</hi> did decide for himself against his Nephew, being the Son of his eldest Brother: But I would distinguish here thus, First in the Families of Kings and Princes, all the Kings Children are preferred to the Kings Brothers, and all the Kings Brothers to the Kings Uncles, and thus it was decided in <hi>France</hi> by <hi>Henry</hi> the third, <hi>Rupanus pag.</hi> 508.

And though in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire before <hi>Alexius Comnenius</hi> the Emperours Son was still pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to his Uncle; Yet that Emperour desiring to put a Mark of Respect upon his own elder Brother, preferred him to his Son, and now the Sons of Princes are so farr preferred, that not onely they, but all the Princes of the Blood are preferred to all other Peers, though they be last Created, as was found by the Parliament of <hi>Paris, anno</hi> 1541. betwixt the Dukes of <hi>Neveres</hi> and <hi>Monpensier.</hi> 2<hi rend="sup">o.</hi> If in other Families the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be of a Dignity equal to his elder Brother, then the Brother will be preferred to the Nephew; as if the Brother be an Earl, and the Nephew a Lord as being an Earles Son, in this case Expectation will not prefer the Nephew, because there are other actual Degrees of Preferrence. 3<hi rend="sup">o.</hi> If the Uncle were a Lord by Creation, and the Nephew a Lord by Birth, in which case, if the Uncle was a Lord before the Nephew was born, the Uncle ought to be preferred as first in Time, but not if the Nephew was first born, and thus <hi>Baldus</hi> distinguishes, <hi>ad L. ut intestato C. de su. &amp; Leg.

apparent Heir are <hi>una &amp; eadem Persona</hi> in the Construction of Law, and that in many things that are Disadvantagious to the Son, he is look'd upon as Heir apparent, in the same way as if his Father were dead; it is therefore just, that as he has the Disadvantages of an apparent Heir, so he ought to have the Advantages of an apparent Heir: And thus We see that Our Statutes having Declared Comprisings bought in by the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Heir to be Redeemable by the Defuncts Creditors, It was found that a Comprising bought in by the eldest Son, even whilst his Father lived, was Redeemable from him and that he was an apparent Heir, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of Law; And therefore since the Law puts him in the same case, as if the Father were Dead, he ought to have the same Precedency, and consequently ought to be preferred to his Uncle, to whom he would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be preferred, if his Father were dead. It is remarkable that in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Uncle was of old acknowledged to be King during not only the Pupillarity of his Pupil; but during the Uncles own Natural Life, which being an Invasion upon the Natural Right of Our Kings, was abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated under <hi>Kenith</hi> the third.</p>

               <p>Lawyers have varied very much in this Point, For some have been of Opinion, that those that are born before the Dignity was attained, cannot pretend to the Precedency due to the Father, for he cannot be said (say they) to be the Son of a King, or Marquess, whom a King or Marquess did not beget; And since those who are born before a Crime is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, loose not their Dignity by the Fathers committing of the Crime, So by the Rule of Contraries, he who was Born before his Father was Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to a Dignity, ought not to participat of that Dignity: This they found likewise upon express Laws, <hi>L. si Senatus Cod. de Dignitat. L. Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralis Cod. de Nupt.</hi> and thus <hi>Darius</hi> was preferred to be King of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians</hi> to <hi>Artabazanes.</hi> Others do more justly conclude, that these are to be Preferred though Born before the Dignity was obtained; For, if he who was Born in that Condition can be called the Kings Son, he must be the Kings eldest Son; And it were very absurd that the Father should be Noble, and the Son not; And if a King had but one Son, he could not be King if this were allowed: and this is most clear <hi>L. Senatoris Filium ff. de Senat.</hi> where it is said, That he is aswell to be called the Son of a Senator, who was Begot before the Father was a Senator, as he who was Begot af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; And though this be true as to Succession, and as to the Degree of Nobility in general, yet many Lawyers are of Opinion, that they do not attain to so eminent a Degree of Nobility, as if they had been Born after the Father attained to his Nobility; For by the former Law, <hi>si Senator natus ex illustri ante Dignitatem adeptam, est clarissimus; solum natus postea, illustris</hi>: Others there are who say, That these who were Born before, may succeed
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:51654:46"/>
to Honours which descended from old Predecessors, but those which were acquired in the Fathers own time, should onely descend to such as were Born after these Honors were acquired. But now generally in <hi>Europe,</hi> and particularly with Us, even those who were Born before the Father attained to any Dignity, do participat of his Dignity, as if they had been born after the same was acquired in all cases.</p>

                  <hi>QVESTION</hi> XIV. Whether ought a Son who is in publick Imployment and Dignified, to Preceed a Father who is not?</head>
               <p>It is answered, That a Son being in publick Imployment ought to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed a Father who is not. And thus <hi>Fabius Maximus</hi> commanded his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to light down from his horse, when he was to meet him; and was praised for mantaining the Dignity of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire in this case: And the Son in this case is not a private person, but Represenrs the Prince or Common-wealth, who are to be preferred to any person; and therefore <hi>Laurentius Celsi</hi> was justly taxed at <hi>Venice,</hi> because he would not meet his Son when he was newly made Duke of <hi>Venice,</hi> least by being discovered before him he should lessen the Perogative of a Father.</p>
               <p>But it may be doubted, Whether though this hold in Employments, it ought to hold in Titles, since in these the Son Represents not the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth; And therefore in these cases the Laws of Nature ought to prevail above the Laws of Honour, especially, if there be none present but Father and Son; But if there be a third person present who will take the place from the Father, but not from the Son, then the Son must preceed the Father; because, though he yeeld to his Father, yet he should not yeeld to a third Party: And it is a general Rule in matters of Precedency, that I must preceed you, if I preceed him who preceeds you, which is not unlike that Maxime used in other parts of Law, <hi>qui vincit vincentem me, vincit me.</hi>

               <p>It may be alleaged that the Daughter of the Lord should not preceed, because, an Earles Daughter should still preceed a Lords Daughter, and this Ladies Father was never an Earl, nor are We to consider futur Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours in the matter of Precedency; And as she would not take it in her Fathers time, so neither ought she after his death: And as her Father himself, being a Lord though an Earles Son, would not have taken place from the younger Earl, so neither should the Lords daughter from the Earles daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he being a younger Earl then that Lords Father: And I find by the Heraulds Records in <hi>England,</hi> that Sir <hi>Thomas Lees</hi> daughter got a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand from the King, to take place as a Lords Daughter, her Father having died before his Father the Lord <hi>Lee,</hi> which proves that she could not have taken place otherwise, and this is commonly receiv'd in <hi>England.</hi> But yet it may be Debated, That the Daughter of that Lord should have the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency, since her Father would have been an elder Earl; And though she could not take place during her Grand-fathers time who was the elder Earl, yet <hi>per jus accrescendi,</hi> and the right of Representation, she comes after her Grand-fathers death, to be the Daughter of the elder Earl, for Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is but a part of Succession; and therefore as she might have right to her Fathers Succession, if she have not Brothers, she may by the same reason have Right to the Honours: And it were very ridiculous to Argue so, as that her elder Brother (if she had any) might take place as an Earles Grand-child, and that she could not take the same place as his Sister; and consequently, since he would take the place of that younger Earl, so should she of that younger Earles Sister or Daughter: And the Reason why she comes to a higher Degree of Precedency by the death of her Grand-father is, because by the right of Representation her Fathers Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily comes in the Grand-fathers place. And to shew, that this Argument, <hi>viz.</hi> Your Father had not the Precedency of me, therefore you cannot have it of my Daughter, is a weak Argument in cases of Representation, may appear from this, That if it were a good Argument, the younger Earl might aswell say to that Lords Son, Your Father never took the place of me, so neither can you; And though it may be Answered to this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that the Disparity betwixt the Brother and Sister lieth in this, That the Son Represents the Grand-father, but the Daughter does not; Yet if We consider it nearly, even this Answer is Fallacious: For though the Daughter Represents not the Grand-father, yet the Fathers Family Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents the Grand-fathers, and so participats all the Honours of the Grand-fathers

I find some Lawyers distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish betwixt such Defects as are Natural, and follow the Havers from their Birth, and these Defects do Exclude from the Succession, so that the next Heir has the same Precedency, as if his elder were dead, if the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession be of Kingdoms, or Fews that have a Dignity annexed to them: But in private Rights, and where the Defects are Accidental, they assert that the Right remains with the Heir though <hi>defectuus,</hi> and consequently he retains also the Precedency, <hi>Tiraquel. quaest.</hi> 23.</p>

               <p>This case did exist in a most illustruous instance in <hi>Scotland</hi>: For King <hi>Robert</hi> the second having begot a Son upon <hi>Elizabeth Mure,</hi> he thereafter Married <hi>Eupham</hi> Daughter to the Earl of <hi>Rosse,</hi> and had by her the Earles of <hi>Strathern,</hi> and <hi>Athol</hi>; after which having married the said <hi>Elizabeth Mure,</hi> that Marriage did Legitimate her Children, and by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment her Children were, by a Recognition and acknowledgement of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, preferred to the Children Born in the Lawful Marriage. The Reasons <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>contra,</hi> urged in that Debate at that time are now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known; But the Arguments which might have been urged in the case, are, 1<hi rend="sup">o.</hi> That a Son so Legitimated would seclude without all Contraversie all Uncles, and other Agnats, Therefore by the same he should Seclude his other Brothers, § <hi>si quis autem defunctis Authent. quibus mod. nat. cap</hi> 1. <hi>qui Filii sunt legit.</hi> 2<hi rend="sup">o.</hi> Legitimation is Retrotracted and drawn back to the time of the Nativity, <hi>cap. tanta qui fil. sunt legit.</hi> and Legitimation puts the Person so Legitimated in the same Condition as if he had never been a Bastard, <hi>L. si quis Filio § pen. ff. de injust. Test.</hi> and this is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed as a particular Respect upon Marriage and its Sacred Character, and to invite men to make Satisfaction for the wrong they have done. 3<hi rend="sup">o.</hi> By the <hi>Roman</hi> Law those that were born in Captivity were not capable of Succession, but how soon they were Ransomed and had returned, they were restored to the Right of <hi>primo-genitor,</hi> and preferred therein to those who were thereafter born at <hi>Rome:</hi> And therefore since such was the Force even of a Civil and unreasonable Fiction, much more ought greater Force to be allowed to Legitimation, which is founded upon so Just and Pious Principles. 4<hi rend="sup">o.</hi> 
                  <hi>Quo-ad</hi> the Right of Succession, the time of the Defuncts death to whom he is to succeed, does regulat the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Succession: And therefore since the Person Legitimated was capable of Succession the time the Defunct died, and was then likewise the eldest, he ought to Succeed as eldest, whatever his Condition was the time of his Birth, <hi>L. post Consanguineos § proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam ff. de suis &amp; Legit. nec enim prius debet de cujusque conditione que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri quam haereditas vel legatum ad eum pertineat, L. in opportet. ff. de Legat.</hi> 2. 5<hi rend="sup">o.</hi> The eldest Son was always eldest, and was onely hindred from this Right of <hi>primo-genitor</hi> and Precedency, by the Legal imperfection of his Birth, and therefore this impediment being removed by the same Law which put it, his Birth-right continues intire.</p>
               <p>But whether this Priviledge should be granted to such as are Legitima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Prince, and not by the subsequent Marriage, may be doubted?

               <p>In answer to this, It is generally concluded, that though both be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on the same day, and in the same hour, the Priority of His <hi>Majesties</hi>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:51654:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Subscription would prefer him in whose Favours His <hi>Majesty</hi> did first superscrib; which may be cleared by His <hi>Majesties</hi> own Declaration, for he being the fountain of Honour, he is the onely fit Judge in all Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies concerning it, or if his <hi>Majesty</hi> do not remember, the Declaration of His Secretary is undoubtedly to be believed, <hi>nam in his quae attingunt off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ium, officium gerentibus est credendum</hi>; But if both His <hi>Majesty,</hi> and His Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary were dead, some think that there were place left for the succeeding King to gratifie either, since the compleating of Rights depends absolutely upon him, who is the first Granter: And by the Feudal Law, and Ours, if Resignation be made at the same time in the Superiours hands, in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of several Persons at the same time, <hi>locus est gratificationi,</hi> as <hi>Craig</hi> also tells Us, and he may prefer either as he pleases.</p>
               <p>Some contend that where several Patents are granted in the same day, the King may prefer either, though it be known which of the two Patents were first signed and superscribed: For in Law, where the difference of time is so little, the Law looks upon it as no Difference at all, <hi>nam de minimis non curat praetor,</hi> and <hi>Albericus</hi> who has write a Treatise <hi>de minimis,</hi> is of this Opinion, and We see that the Law in other cases brings in equally such as approach so near one another in time, nor can the King be said to be <hi>functus officio,</hi> and to have denuded himself of the power of Prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, where the right of Preference is so small; as when the King super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes both the Patents at the same time, as that he does not intermix any other business, <hi>nec divertit ad alium actum,</hi> there indeed it seems that neither can claim Preference by the Priority of Signing, since it appears His <hi>Majesty</hi> had no design of Preferring the one to the other, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers are ordinarly presented to him by accident, as they fall in course. It may then be alledged, that in such dubious cases, where Preference cannot be known from the superscription of the Patents, and where His <hi>Majesty</hi> does not Declare the Preference by any posterior Act, but leaves both Parties to the Common Law, that there he who had the Preceden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy before these Patents ought to be continued in the Preference, since in all dubious cases the Law still prefers the Possessor, <hi>&amp; semper in casu dubio pro possessore respondendum</hi>; Nor can it be imagined that His <hi>Majesty</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to Degrade a person whom He hath actually Preferred; But so it is, that to postpone a man to him to whom he was formerly preferred, is somewhat to Degrade him: And since Accumulation and Conjunction of Titles has very many effects in the case of Preference, the least effect it can have, is to prefer the Haver in such a dubious case.</p>
               <p>I likewise conceive, That if two Patents were given at the same time, One to a Person who had served His <hi>Majesty,</hi> and much more to an actual Domestick, and the other to a Person who had not served, nor were no Domestick, that in these cases he who had served, or were a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestick would be preferred, because of the presumed affection of the Prince, and the former Service of the Receiver.</p>

                  <hi>QVESTION</hi> XXII. Whether is Precedency to be Ruled according to the date of the Provision, Investiture, or actual Possession?</head>
               <p>There are three several times from which ordinarly Precedency is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, The first is the time when the Honour is first granted, which is called by Lawyers <hi>tempus provisionis,</hi> If the Advancement be of one single Person to a single Dignity; or <hi>tempus Cooptationis,</hi> if the Person Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced be associated into any Society, as to be One of moe Judges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The second period of Time, is the time of the Investiture, as when a Nobleman is brought in in his Robs. The third is, the time when he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends actual Possession.</p>
               <p>These who write upon this Subject do conclude, That Precedency is to be given not from the time of Promotion or Provision, but from the entry to Possession, so that he who is last Provided or Dignified will have Precedency, if he first actually apprehended possession, <hi>Bald. in cap. cum olim. de consuetud.

               <p>Though this hold in Honours which require Administration, such as the being in a Judicatory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet it holds not in Honours where no Administration is requisit, And thus, if two be Advanced to be Earles, he whose Patent is first past the Kings hand will have the Precedency, though the other serve in the first Parliament, or be present there a day before the other, or have his Patent first Registrat; for it is the King, and not his Clerk, that makes Noble, but yet this is Debated by <hi>La Rocque, cap.</hi> 66. Lawyers likewise Observe that the former Rule, preferring him who has first Served to him who was first Provided or Invested, holds good, though he who was first Provided or Invested was not <hi>in mora,</hi> and did not delay to take Possession, but was hindred by some extrinsick Impediment, such as Sicknes; And this they say was decided the 27 of <hi>April,</hi> 1594. <hi>in Rota Romana,</hi> and this is observed to be the common Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion by <hi>Gonzales ad regulam</hi> 8. <hi>Cancel.</hi> and this they prove by the Analogy of other Feudal Rights, which being to be compleated by Possession, the Law considers not whether the Party who should have possest was hindred from attaining to Possession, but who first attained to Possession.</p>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d in that Case?</head>
               <p>To the first of these questions it is answered by some Lawyers, That the President being absent, the eldest Member in Dignity, may by his own Authority call the meeting <hi>Convocare Collegium,</hi> as they call it, and of this opinion are <hi>Hostiensis, Panorm. Bald. ad cap.</hi> 1. <hi>de Maior &amp; Obed</hi>: but others are of opinion that the Major part has only right to conveen the rest in that case <hi>Innocent. ad cap.</hi> 2. <hi>de operi. nov. nunc.</hi> But a third Sect of Lawyers do, for agreeing the former opinions, assert that in Ecclesiastick meetings, the eldest may by his own Authority call the rest, but not so in Laick meetings; and the reason of this Distinction seems to be, because Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are bound to give more Obedience to their Seniors, and there is less fear of Design amongst them, both because they are presumed to be more disinterested, and because in their meetings their Posterity is not to gain: But without any Distinction I should think, that the eldest may always Convocat, for there may be hazard in delay, if the greater part were requisit, for the question still recurrs who should call the greater part, nor can there be great hazard in calling, for the onely hazard is the packing of a Quorum, and this may be prevented, by imposing a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity upon those who meet to advertise the rest.</p>
               <p>To the second question it is answered, That this is much to be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Custom, and Our Courts in <hi>Scotland</hi> suffer not the eldest to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, but choose alwayes one to preceed in the absence of their constant President; and this seems to be most Reasonable, because every Member of a Court is not ordinarly fit to be a President: And yet there are some Lawyers who distinguish betwixt such Courts, to whom the chief Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrat has chosen no constant President; and in these they say the eldest cannot preceed, though they say he ought to preceed in these Courts where the King has choos'd a President, for as in these the members can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not choose a constant President, so neither can they choose a Vice-president, since <hi>surrogatum subit naturam surrogati,</hi> whereas the eldest is a President by the Magistrates tacit Election, since he has that Seniority from the King, or supream Magistrate, which does prefer him to be President: and we see that amongst Souldiers, the eldest Officer alwayes commands, when the superiour Officer is absent.</p>

               <p>It would seem that a Peer cannot be Degraded, though he hath not a suteable Estate, because the King may Nobilitate a person that wants an

               <p>But I find that <hi>Cook</hi> 4. <hi>inst. folio</hi> 355. and the Authour of <hi>Ius Imaginis, pag.</hi> 25. conclude that Poverty is a good cause for the Degrading of a Peer, an instance whereof, they give in <hi>George Nevil</hi> Duke of <hi>Bedford,</hi> who was Degraded by Act of Parl. 17. <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, of which Act this is the tenour, <hi>And forasmuch as it is openly known, that the said</hi> George <hi>hath not, nor by Inheritance may have any livelyhood to support the said Name, Estate, and Dignity, or any name of Estate, as oftentimes it is seen, that when any Lord is called to high Estate, and have not livelyhood convenient to support the same Dignity, it induceth great Poverty, and Indigence, and causeth often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Extortion, Embracery, and Maintenance to be had, to the great trouble of such Countries, where such Estate shall happen to be inhabited; Wherefore the King by Advice of his Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, Ordaineth, Establisheth, and Enacteth, that from henceforth the same Erection, and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the same Duke, and all the names of Dignity to the said</hi> George, <hi>or to</hi> John Nevil <hi>his Father, be from henceforth void, and of none effect,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>From which Act three things may be well observed,</p>
               <p>First, That the said Duke had not any Possessions to support his Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, yet his Dignity could not be taken away from him without an Act of Parliament.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The inconveniencies appear, where a great Estate or Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is not accompanied with a livelyhood.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This is a good Cause to take away the Dignity by Parliament.</p>
               <p>For reconciling which opinions, it seems indeed, that though a person who is noble by Birth should fall into poverty, yet that poverty can no more Degrade him from his Nobility, then it can taint his Blood; but though it cannot root out that Noble Character from his Blood, and make him no Gentleman, yet it seems a good reason why he may be De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded from being a Peer of the Realm: For the being a Peer, is no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessar effect of Blood, but a mark of the Royal bounty, bestowed for the better Government and Advantage of the Kingdom, Earles being by their Original <hi>Praepositi Comitatus,</hi> or Commanders of the County, and Counties or Shires are so called, because they are the Governments of a Count or Earl: And therefore when the King and Parliament find that they are not fit to bear this quality, they may justly take away that Honour that was given, nor can there be any thing so inconvenient, as that these should represent the Kingdom in its greatest concerns, and burden it with with Taxes, who have no interest in the one, nor can bear any share in the other. And that these Feudal Dignities and markes of Nobility may be taken off by the loss of the Fews, is clear by <hi>Bartolus in L. inam. Cod. de Dignitatibus,</hi> and that this is the custome of <hi>Sicily</hi> is clear, <hi>Afflictus. Col. non. in</hi> 6. <hi>not.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:51654:51"/>It may likewise seem reasonable, that as the King onely can bestow No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, so that it should be onely proper for him to Degrade; And since he may Create any Nobleman though he be poor, so he may continue him so, notwithstanding of his Poverty, specially seing the being a Peer is but to be the Princes Counsellour, nor can any judge who are fit to be his Counsellours, but himself; nor is the Parliament any thing but his great Council: But since this Degradation is a kind of Forfeitur, it seems that the Parliament onely can be Judges therein, since the King does not use to Forfeit by his own Authority; And though the former Arguments may prove that a Peer cannot be Degraded for poverty, except the King pleases, which is certainly true, since no Act of Parliament can pass with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Royal consent, yet they prove not that the King may Degrade a Nobleman by his own Authority, except he may Judge all cases immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately by himself.</p>

               <p>In answering to this case, We must distinguish betwixt such as derive their Nobility from their Fathers onely, and some think that in that case, the misbehaviour of the Father does extinguish the Nobility of the Race, and that the Descendants are no more Noble, except they be restored by an express Gift; Or otherwise the Nobility of the Race has descended from a long Series of Predecessours, and then the Fathers Deed does not prejudge them, since they do not owe their Nobility to him, and the Prince having Nobilitat such a man and his Posterity, they owe their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to the King, and derive it from him equally with the Father, which Distinction I find in the Learned <hi>Faber. Cod. L.</hi> 9. <hi>T.</hi> 28. <hi>Def.</hi> 1. But it seems that by this last reason, Even that Nobility which is begun in the Father cannot be lost by his fault: And therefore some Lawyers have been of Opinion, that that Nobility which descends by immemorial possession, and which flows not from a particular priviledge and Concession, can never be taken away by the Fathers baseness or crime, <hi>Warnaesius tom.</hi> 1. <hi>responso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:51654:51"/>
de Iure Pontificio Consil.</hi> 20. <hi>num.</hi> 7. and thus we find in the <hi>Roman</hi> Story, that <hi>Marcus Emilius Scaurus</hi> was found not to have lost his Nobility by his Fathers becoming a bearer of Coals, <hi>Curt. conjectur. jur. civil. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 20. and others think that as it is sufficient for acquiring Nobility, that the Grand-father and Father have been repute Noble; So by the rule of Contraries, it is sufficient for extinguishing Nobility, that the Father and Grand-father have been repute Ignoble; And though the rights of Blood cannot be lost by prescription, yet Nobility may be lost, as all other priviledges can, by not exersing or owning it time out of mind.</p>
               <p>It is fit to know, that in this Isle not onely that Nobility which comes by Succession and Immemorial possession, but even that which comes by priviledge and Concession can be Forfeited by the Fathers Crime; and in this We differ from <hi>Warnesius</hi> opinion, and therefore the Children must be rehabilitat and restored by the King; But the Fathers unworthiness in exercising mean shifts and Trades, does not amongst us Derogate from the Childrens Nobility, as in other Nations; Nor do I see any reason for the distinction used by <hi>Warnesius,</hi> for all Nobility must be acknowledged to have flowed originally from the King by Concession, and even that Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which comes by priviledge, does descend upon the Children by the Kings grant to them aswell as the Father, and so cannot be prejudged by any personal deed of his, except in the case of a Crime against the King, for that is still implyed in the Concession, and it is not just that the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Traitours should enjoy those titles, and that Nobility which might be useful to them in revenging their unjust quarrels.</p>

               <p>First, If the person who renounced his Dignity was preferred to a Higher or more Noble, in which case if he return to his first Imployment, he looses not the Precedency due to it, for a greater Dignity never prejudges the lesser, <hi>L.</hi> 3. <hi>C. de Dignitatibus Rupanus, lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 27. and contains in it the lesser, <hi>per eminentiam,</hi> as Lawyers speak, <hi>superveniens major Dignitas au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get non minuit statum,</hi> except the two Offices be incompatible in themselves, for then the lesser is extinguisht by the greater, <hi>L. si debitoris ff. de fidejussor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second exception is, If the person in whose favours the Resignation was made, will not accept, and upon his refusal the Resigner does pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:51654:52"/>
return to his Precedency, <hi>L. si forte ff. de Offic.

               <p>The third Exception is, If he who made the Resignation do presently repent, for in that case likewise he is in the condition, as if he Resigned not; And thus the Law takes not advantage of Our sudden and undigested thoughts, <hi>Et uxor quae mox rediit divertisse non videtur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth Exception given by him is, If he who Resigned reserved to himself his former Precedency: for which though there be several <hi>Roman</hi> decisions, yet it is very debateable, how far a man can by Protestation or Paction, distinguish and reserve a Precedency, when he has Resigned or Disponed the Imployment to which it was annexed; For since the Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency is onely due upon the account of the Imployment, it would seem that he who has Resigned the Imployment, cannot retain the Precedency, and to do so, were to retain <hi>accidens sine subjecto:</hi>

                  <hi>QVESTION</hi> XXX. Whether may a Nobleman resign his Honours in favours of a third Party? And if the Kings Confirmation thereupon will exclude the nearest Agnats, who would else have succeeded by their right of Blood?</head>
               <p>This question seems of great Importance and intricacy: For it may seem that he may transfer his title in prejudice of his nearest Heirs, because the title is onely a Fee, and all Fews may be alienated; nor is this a meer right of Blood, but a priviledge bestowed by the King, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly may be transferred by his consent: Nor can their be any thing more for the interest either of the Kingdom or of Noble Families, than that when the nearest Heir is unfit to succeed, wanting either Means or Wit suitable to such a Dignity, it should be in the power of the King, and the Noble person himself to choose a fit successor. Like as this was so decided in the case of <hi>Robert</hi> King of <hi>Sicily, Cl. pastoral. de re Iud.</hi> And many Lawyers have been of opinion, that even elder Brothers might resign their right of Succession and <hi>primo-genitur</hi> in favours of the third Brother, passing by the second, <hi>vid. c.</hi> 1. § <hi>praeterea tit. quib. mod. feud. amit. &amp; Bald. Consil.</hi> 389.</p>
               <p>But others conclude, That the nearest by Blood are not prejudged by such Resignations: Because this is a right flowing from the favour of Nature and Law, <hi>Naturae &amp; Legis donum quod non potest auferri, L. si ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogater, ff. § sed an ff. de Adopt.</hi> nor is Dignity exposable to sale or in Commerce, <hi>L. Iulianus ff. si quis omiss.</hi> Whereas if such Resignations or transmissions were sustainable, all titles might be sold, and the meanest Fellow if Rich, might by the favour of a Minister, and the folly of the present Possessor, exclude the Noblest Race: And by the Feudal Law, though a Vassal may denude himself, yet he cannot transmit his Fee in favours of remoter Heirs to the prejudice of the nearer, <hi>cap. Titius tit. si de feud. fuer. Contravers.</hi> this case is not decided with us; but the King upon a

Resignation from the late Earl of <hi>Caithnes</hi> in favours of <hi>Glenurchy,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the title in his favours, but by a new Patent, and without the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Precedency, and discharged by a letter the next Heir to use the title, till the matter should be decided by the Judge competent. But I find that in <hi>England Ed.</hi> 2. granted to <hi>Edmond de Lincourt</hi> upon his Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a Patent under the great Seal, impowering him to assign his Sirname, Arms, and Barony: But the Lord <hi>Hoe</hi> having assigned his Name, Arms, and Dignity without the Kings licence, the deed was adjudged void in Parliament; From which the Authour of <hi>Ius imaginis, pag.</hi> 27. concludes first, That the title of Nobility may be assigned: Secondly, That it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be assigned without the Kings licence: And yet I find that in the Vis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>Purbecks</hi> case, it was lately found by the parliament of <hi>England,</hi> that a Nobleman could not levey a fine upon his Honour in prejudice of his Heir, that is to say, That a Nobleman could not do any deed to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of his Honour, by alienating or surrendring the same to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of his Heir, though I am informed that there were very many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances adduced for clearing the contrare opinion.</p>

               <p>It seems that the Honour being in that case due upon the account of the Office, should cease with its cause: But yet such respect is given by the Law to those who have once enjoyed an Office, and used it well, that the former Dignity and Precedency is allowed them after they have resigned the Office, <hi>L. eam Legem ff. de excusat.

               <p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:51654:53"/>I find this to have been agitated in the Parliament of <hi>Savoy, anno</hi> 1590. in the case of the Bishop of <hi>Alby,</hi> who being called from being a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellour in that Parliament to a Bishoprick, and his place being filled by another, he thereafter was called back to be a Counsellour: And this may fall out with us in many cases, as for instance, If one should be called from being a Lord of the Session to be Justice General, and should there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after be returned to be a Lord of the Session: And I find it was decided in <hi>Savoy,</hi> that the person so recalled ought to preceed according to his first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stalment; but the reason there was that the Prince had expresly declared at his Demission, that if he returned he should return to his first Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, and that it were indecent that he who was first formerly in that Judicature, should therafter sit in the lowest place, meerly because he was once called away to a higher preferment: And in my opinion, If the Prince had not so expresly declared at the first Demission, the case might have been harder, but that Declaration made that those who were thereafter preferred, could not think themselves prejudged by this new readmission, since their instalment was still burdened with this tacit qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. I likewise think, that if he had returned before any others had been advanced, the difficulty had been much less, since there no third par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was prejudged of a right acquired <hi>medio tempore</hi>; albeit it might be alleaged that by his Translation, the other Judges formerly below him suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to his right of Precedency; For against this I conceive the former protestation could have easily guarded, albeit that protestation does seem <hi>contraria facto,</hi> and the quality adjected to be inconsistent with the nature of the thing, where the place was filled by another, since regularly two cannot preserve the same Rank or Degree, <hi>Arg. L. cum in Testamento ff. de haered. instituend.</hi> It may be likewise argued, that though this quality and protestation was admistable, where the party so called away was called to a higher Dignity of the same rank, that there the lesser was possest by possessing the greater, as if a Justice General should be called back to be a Lord; Yet this would not hold, notwithstanding of the former prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station and quality, where he is called away to a lesser imployment, or where he is called to an imployment of a different and incompatible Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as from being a Judge to be a Collonel: And yet all these questions seem of less difficulty with Us, where the Prince may certainly admit a Judge to be the first or last: And therefore amongst Us these questions would onely take place, where the person formerly installed was called away or preferred without any such Declaration of the King in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours.</p>

               <p>It is answered, Where two did exchange Imployments, and thereafter returned to their old Imployments, Lawyers are of opinion, that in that case they return to their former Precedency, and that their imployments are not looked upon as new imployments, because the one possest still by the other, and so the possession was still the same, as if it had been by themselves, <hi>L'oiseau lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. <hi>Rupan. lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 27. but though this may hold where both of them changed but for a time, since there indeed the one possest by the other; yet this seems harder, in the case where both of them exchanged absolutely and for ever: For there, their former right seems to have been extinguished, and the Imployments to be new as to both.</p>

               <p>To which it is answered by <hi>Gothofred. cap.</hi> 6. <hi>Thes.</hi> 45. That he is not by this Restitution to recover his former Precedency from which he was Degraded, but he must preceed by vertue of his new title onely: But I should rather distinguish betwixt these who are restored by way of Justice, in which case the Precedency ought to be the same, because the Restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be way of Justice takes away the Impediment and Degradation, as if it had never been; but where the Restitution is onely by way of Grace, there the Fault and Sentence still remains, though the punishment be taken off; and there the Restitution ought not to restore the Precedency, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of those who had acquired titles betwixt the Forfeitour and Resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution: A clear instance whereof we have in the Earl of <hi>Crawfurd,</hi> who being Forfeit for Rebelling against K. <hi>Iames</hi> the 2. at the Battel of <hi>Brichen,</hi> and being thereafter restored, he was not restored so as to take place from the Earl of <hi>Huntly</hi>?

                  <hi>QVESTION</hi> XXXVI. Whether have the Ambassadours of Monarchs the Precedency from other Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs or Princes themselves, if personally present, even as the Kings would do whom they represent? And if in all cases an Ambassadour ought to have the same Precedency that is due to his Constituent?</head>
               <p>To this it is answered, That though an Ambassadour represents the Monarch from whom he derives his Commission, and that some learned Lawyers do upon that account assert, that they are to have the same Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency that is due to their Master, and so to be preferred to all Kings and Princes though present, to whom their Constituents would have been preferred, <hi>Paschal. de Legat. cap.</hi> 38. yet the custom of Nations has run contrar to his opinion, in preferring even inferiour Kings and Princes: And it is decided amongst the Princes of <hi>Germany, Tit.</hi> 25. <hi>Aureae Bullae, Car.</hi> 4. And in <hi>anno</hi> 1542. the Ambassadours of <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth Emperour, were decerned to cede the Precedency to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the reasons are, 1<hi rend="sup">o.</hi> Because Princes found it their Interest to have no Subject compete with them, or to have their own presence lessened by such marks of Disrespect. 2<hi rend="sup">o.</hi> In a Prince who is present there resides True and Original Majesty; whereas an Ambassadour is onely dignified with a Supposititious and Representative Honour, shining (if I may so say) with borrowed rayes: And of this opinion are <hi>Brunus de Legat. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. and <hi>Costa Consil.</hi> 44. though <hi>Zouch. de Iure inter Gentes</hi> seems to favour <hi>Paschals</hi> opinion.</p>
               <p>It may be likewise doubted, whether an Ambassadour does retain the same Precedency due to him as Ambassadour, when the Prince who sent him comes to the place himself: And this was debated by the Earl <hi>Marishal</hi> who was sent over Ambassador to <hi>Denmark,</hi> when K. <hi>Ia.</hi> 6. went over in person there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, and brought over Chancellour <hi>Maitland</hi> with him, who challenged the Precedency from the Earl <hi>Marishal,</hi> alleaging that an Ambassadours Power evanishes upon his Princes appearance: Which debate was decided by King <hi>Iames</hi> in favours of the Chancellour, albeit the Earl contended, That as his Ambassie ceased upon the Kings coming thither, so did the others Office as Chancellour cease in a forreign Kingdom, and therefore that he should have preceeded as being an Earl.</p>
               <p>The former opinion preferring inferiour Princes when Personally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is so much the rather true, that Ambassadours are not, when they come to visit the Judicatures of the Nations where they
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:51654:54"/>
preceed allowed the same Precedency; And generally it is given as a rule by Lawyers, that <hi>in locis &amp; actibus Iudicialibus Legatis praecedentia solita non servatur, &amp; non pro dignitate Regis aut alterius a quo ablegati sunt, Gotho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred. de Iure praecedentiae, cap.</hi> 7. <hi>num.</hi> 47. so that though Kings themselves would sit above all these Judicatures, yet their Ambassadours sit but among them; Thus the <hi>Venetian</hi> Ambassadour was onely placed in the Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> after the Bishops, as <hi>Rupan.</hi> observes, <hi>lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>Though Ambassadours have the same Precedency that is due to their Constituents, yet Agents and Residents of Princes have not, nor has the Popes Nuncio the Precedency that is due to an Ambassadour, <hi>Gothofred<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ibid.</hi> for these in effect are sent oftentimes to prevent the Debates that might-fall amongst Ambassadours, and therefore the <hi>French</hi> King sends very rarely his Ambassadours to the Emperours Court, because he knows that Court would give the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ambassadours the Precedency, which he thinks is due to his Ambassadours.</p>

               <p>To which it is answered, That though after an honourable Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is over, whether by Dimission, or by the expyring of the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, the Precedency thereto annex'd ceases with it; Yet the Prince some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times gratifies the person with a continuance of some Precedency and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: And in the Records of the <hi>Herauld</hi> Office in <hi>England,</hi> I find that in a Court <hi>Marishal,</hi> Sir <hi>Dudley Diggs,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Smith,</hi> were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged to have the Precedency from other Knights-Batchelours of their own Degree, because they had been Ambassadours, though their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission was expired.

               <p>It would seem that as Ambassadours have the same place that is due to him whom they represent, so those who represent Subjects, as Viccars who represent the Bishop, Deputs who represent Judges, ought to have the same place that is due to those whom they represent: I find that <hi>L.</hi> 7. <hi>de Bonorcodicil.

Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectorum, Proconsulum, Vicariorum, &amp; Exconsularium.</hi> And certainly in those Acts, wherein they represent their Constituent, they have the same Precedency that is due to him, <hi>Felin. in cap. cum olim de Offic. de Legat.</hi> And thus by the Canon Law, the Bishops Viccar is preferred to the Dean,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:51654:55"/>
and Arch-dean, and not onely are these representative Dignities preferred in the acts of their Jurisdiction, but even in all other deeds, which neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily preceed or follow them; And some Lawyers are of Opinion, that they are to be preferred to the same Dignity, in all promiscuous and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different Acts which fall in during the time of the Representation, and thus <hi>Cautuccius decis.</hi> 582. is of Opinion, that the Bishops Viccar sent by him to hold a Synod, is to have Precedency before all the Chapter, not onely in the Synod it self, but likwise in all other Assemblies, Visits, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments, during his Commission: But the contrare of this is mantained by <hi>Menoch, Consil.</hi> 51. And in my Opinion, these Doctors may be thus reconciled, <hi>viz.</hi> If the Representation flow immediately from the Law, as for instance, If the Council should Delegat any man to be Sheriff, there the person substitut would have in all cases during his Commission, the same place that is due to him in whose place he was surrogat, for there <hi>Surrogatum sapit naturam surrogati</hi>; But if the Representation flow from the person himself whom he Represents, in that case the Representative has onely the Precedency, whilst he is exercising the Office, or in Actions thereto relating; And thus Sheriff-deputs with us have onely the Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency due to their Constituents, whilest they are exercising these Acts which relate to their Office: And yet I think, that those Representatives of Subjects have even in all extrinsick and indifferent Acts the Precedency due to their Constituents, when they meet with others of the same De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and thus amongst Sheriff-Deputes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Precedency is to be given according to the Precedency that is due to the Principal Sheriffs.</p>

               <p>I conceive that Assessors chosen by a Judge get no Precedency thereby, since Subjects cannot bestow Dignities; but that where the Prince names any man Assessor to a Judicature, the person so named has thereby the Precedency next to the Judge to whom he is named Assessor, <hi>nam est ejus umbra,</hi> his shadow as the Law speaks, and the shadow should follow the body: And with Us when the Council names Assessors to the Justices, the Assessors vote onely after the Justices; And yet in <hi>France</hi> I find that Assessors take place after the President, and before the other Councellours, and so it was decided at <hi>Paris,</hi> 1608.</p>

               <p>But it may be urged on the Kings part, that the King being the onely fountain of Honour, he may do therein as he pleases, except in so far as he is limited by Law; And therefore since there is no Law with us limiting the King in this point, he may do therein as he pleases. 2<hi rend="sup">o.</hi> The King by Act of Parliament, <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, is limited as to this point in <hi>England,</hi> so that he can grant no such Preference; And therefore it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that this was formerly in his power even there, and that since he is not limited here, his power is here intire as to this point, whereof many instances are given in answer to <hi>quest.</hi> 35. and since that statute, it is thought that His <hi>Majesty</hi> may ordain the last Knight to preceed all the rest formerly dubb'd and created, because Knights are not exprest in that statute. 3<hi rend="sup">o.</hi> We see the King in <hi>Scotland</hi> does impower Countesses to retain their former Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency, though they marry a Husband of a Rank inferiour to their first Husband; And Dukes Daughters even after their Marriage to retain the Precedency due to them as Dukes Daughters. 4<hi rend="sup">o.</hi> His <hi>Majesty</hi> does by new Confirmations transfer the Honours to Hiers Female, though the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents at first were onely granted to Hiers male, and so by the not existing of the Hiers Male, those Earles who have the next Precedency might aswell alleadge, That the King could not by any new right in favours of the Hiers Female prejudge them. 5<hi rend="sup">o.</hi> His <hi>Majesty</hi> does sometimes appoint any of His Officers of State to preceed other as he pleases, though these may likewise alleadge, that there is <hi>jus quaesitum</hi> to them by their prior Gifts: 6<hi rend="sup">o.</hi> His <hi>Majesty</hi> restores the Sons of persons forfeited to their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Precedency, notwithstanding of the <hi>jus quaesitum,</hi> by others <hi>medio tempore.</hi> 7<hi rend="sup">o.</hi> The King has oblieged himself not to prefer the Knights of <hi>Nova Scotia,</hi> or Knights-Baronets, otherwise then according to their Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which had been unnecssar, if the King could not have preferred them by His Royal prerogative: Sometimes also His <hi>Majesty</hi> confirms to the Nobility the entails of their Estates, whereby they have power to name their Successour with the Precedency due to themselves, which right being ordinarly ratified in Parliament, uses to establish and transfer the Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency upon the Heir or Successour so nominated; But since Ratifications pass without observation, and oftentimes without reading, it may be doubted whether such a Ratification should prejudge even these who were Members of Parliament, but much more such as were not present, or such as were Created thereafter, these Ratifications not being properly publick and Legistative statutes, and so can bind onely such as consented.</p>

                  <hi>QVESTION</hi> XLI. Whether if the King should creat an Earl with Precedency to all other Earles, during his life? Or if when an Earl is Forfeited, will his Lady in either of these cases retain the Precedency she formerly enjoyed during her Husbands life?</head>
               <p>To which it is answered, That as to the first it was expresly decided in <hi>England,</hi> in the case of the Earl of <hi>Notingham,</hi> that he upon the surrender of the Admirals Office, being by King <hi>Iames</hi> allowed the same Precedency that belonged to <hi>Iohn</hi> Lord <hi>Moubray</hi> his predecessour, That therefore his Lady should enjoy the same Precedency if she survived him, because this was not a Dignity of Office, but a real Dignity settled in his person; and generally in all real Dignities such as those of <hi>Dukes, Marquesses, Earles,</hi> &amp;c. the wives participat the Husbands honour even after his death, for it is not the Patent that confers the Honour upon her, for else she could not enjoy the same except she were therein mentioned, but her right flows from the Common-Law which illustrates the Wife with the Husbands Dignity, because Marriage is <hi>individua vitae consuetudo</hi>; And in the Law, the Husband and Wife are one person, and for the same reason we see likewise that the Wives of Knights-Batchelours, and Knights of the Bath, enjoy the same Precedency that was due to their Husbands, though they enjoyed the same for Life: And whereas it may be objected that the Husband having the Honour but for Life, it cannot be continued longer then for the time limited, or to be transferred to the Wife after the death of her Husband. It is answered by the same rule and proportion no wife whatsoever should enjoy the title of her Husbands honour after his deceas, but then all the honour and place should surceas, for she challenges no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but from her Husband: The Honour for perpetuity to the Heirs, concerns onely the Descendents and they are thereby Enobled; But to her a state for Life, and a state to the Heirs is all one. I find also that Sir <hi>William Heram</hi> having married the daughter and Heir of the Lord <hi>Saye,</hi> and so being in her right a Baron, and by reason of that Marriage sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned to the Parliament as a Peer of the Realm, having survived his wife, albeit he had no Issue by her, he notwithstanding enjoyed that title and dignity during his life.</p>
               <p>To the second branch of this question it is answered, That the wife of a person forfeited enjoyes the same title and dignity that was due to her before the forfeiture; for though it may seem that the dignity of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily is extinguished, and consequently she cannot enjoy it; Yet the crime punishes onely the person, and corrupts onely the blood <hi>quo-ad</hi> the Descendents, but not <hi>quo-ad</hi> the Wife: And though the honour be extinguished, yet being extinguished upon a personal account, the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ought not to reach further then the crime.</p>

                  <hi>QVESTION</hi> XLII. Whether amongst those of the Royal Line, does the next to the Royal Stock preceed? Or does the Precedency belong to the eldest of that Branch?</head>
               <p>The reason of this doubt is, Because as in other Nobility the first who is dignified has still the Precedency, as being farthest removed from the Dreggs and Lees of the Vulgar; So amongst those who are descended of Kings, the last is still preferred as being nearer to the Common-Stock, by which all are Enobled: And therefore the Uncle, it seems, should preceed his Nephew by the elder Brother, as being a Degree nearer to the Stock, as was alleaged by the Cardinal of <hi>Bourbon</hi> Uncle to <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth; But yet it was justly decided for <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, because though the younger Branch be still preferred, yet amongst these of the same Branch the eldest is still preferable, for by the right of Representation he Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented his Father, which Father would have been preferred, and here again the right of Birth-right still returns: And this holds not only in <hi>France,</hi> as <hi>Tillet</hi> observes, but with us in <hi>Britain,</hi> and generally in all Law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 6. and 1. <hi>Cron.</hi> 4. <hi>vid.

               <p>To this it is answered, That amongst both the <hi>Iews, Greeks,</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> where three were either sitting or walking, the midle-place was thought the chief place; but where two were without a third, the right Hand was concluded the more Noble amongst the <hi>Iews:</hi> and thus the Scripture tells us, <hi>That such as are to be saved shal sit at the right hand of GOD</hi>; And yet in <hi>Iacobs</hi> Blessing <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Manasseh,</hi> the left hand was preferred, <hi>Genes.</hi> 48. <hi>vid.

                  <hi>QVESTION</hi> XLIV. Whether in Improbations raised to secure Precedency, can Certifications be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, aswell, against Patents of Honour as against other Writes?</head>
               <p>This question having occurred in a Debate <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1672. betwixt the Earl of <hi>Sutherland</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Errol,</hi> It was urged that in Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratours of Precedency, and Improbations raised for securing thereof, no Certification could be granted, because 1<hi rend="sup">o.</hi> such Certifications were one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly granted where the Right and Title to be improven was constitute by Write; But so it is, that the Dignity and Honour of <hi>Dukes, Marquesses, Earles,</hi> &amp;c. was not onely established by Patents, or Infeftments, but might be acquired by bringing them in to Parliament in their Robes, and such other formes of Creation, as have been practised both amongst us and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations, against which no Certification could operat. 2<hi rend="sup">o.</hi> Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations are onely allowed where the Pursuer of the Improbation has a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect title to that whereof the Right is to be improven, exclusive of all others: But so it is that the Earl of <hi>Sutherland,</hi> nor no other has an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press, and explicite Right to be the first Earl of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and any right he has to the Precedency; arises onely consequentially. 3<hi rend="sup">o.</hi> Improbations being onely a remedy introduced by our Law and the native designe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of being to secure real rights, and private Estates: it ought to be extended to no such case, as that of Dignities and Honours, to which it has never heen applyed, during these many years that Improbations have been used here, and to which certainly our Predecessours would have applyed them, if the nature of the action would have allowed it.</p>
               <p>To which it was answered, That Certifications being introduced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us, to secure the Pursuer against any Evidents in the Defenders hand, which might prejudge the Pursuers right, they ought to be exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to Honours established by Patent, or Infeftment, these being rights that are transmitted by Write, and this being the nature of those Certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, they ought to take place every where except where express Law or Decisions have restricted them. And therefore, since there is no Law nor Decision, Declaring that Certificationss shall not be granted against Patens, or Infeftments which transmit Honour: they ought to be granted against these, aswell as against other rights. Nor is it craved, that these Certifications should run against Honours transmitted <hi>via facti,</hi> such as <hi>Robing,</hi> and <hi>Belting,</hi> and though the Pursuer be not designed by his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feftments the first Earl, yet that cannot hinder him from removing by this Certification, all Writes, or Evidents, which may hinder him to be the first, Upon which Debate, the Lords refused to grant Certification against such Patents, or Infeftments.</p>

               <head>Courses taken by Princes and Iudges, when they intend to shun the decyding of Contraversies concerning Precedency, and to preserve the Rights of all the Competitors.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> They ordain the Competitors to preceed one another by turns, and alternatively: And thus the Emperour <hi>Lewis</hi> the fourth did in <hi>anno</hi> 1328. decide betwixt the Prince <hi>Palatine,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and so the Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> decided in <hi>anno</hi> 1616; but lest the first turn should give the Precedency that uses to be decided by lot. And I find this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternation very old, for the <hi>Thebans</hi> did so decide betwixt the Brother-Kings, <hi>Etheocles</hi> and <hi>Polinix</hi>; and <hi>Plutarch</hi> observes the same betwixt <hi>Thye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes</hi> and <hi>Attreus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> They use to assigne one of the Competitors a place out of all Rank; as was done to the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ambassadour in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and is frequently done in Our Parliaments; But though this preserves the Right, it insinuates a Ceding: And therefore the juster way is to place both so without the Benches, as that neither of their seats can shew any Preference, as was done at the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> betwixt the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours Ambassadour and the Cardinal of <hi>Trent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> They use to cause them enter by several doors, as was observed betwixt the Queen of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Margaret</hi> sister to <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, as <hi>Guicciardin</hi> observes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> They use round tables, or to write the names of the Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in a circle, an example whereof we have in <hi>Gaius, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Institut.</hi> and Pope <hi>Vrbane</hi> having desired the <hi>Franciscans</hi> to give him three of their number out of which he might chuse one to be Cardinal, they wrote down their three names circular-ways; but in this case, the names should be written down exactly in the midle of the table or paper; for else as <hi>Crantzius</hi> observes, he whose name is next to the top of the paper has thereby some Precedency.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The eldest of the Competitors is still ordained to preceed: Of which <hi>Livius</hi> gives an instance, <hi>lib.</hi> 42. and King <hi>Iames</hi> the sixth decided so between several Families in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and particularly between the Lairds of <hi>Blair</hi> and <hi>Balthaok.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Sometimes he who was first promoted to a Benefice or Office is preferred, where the difference is betwixt the Offices or Benefices; and thus it was decided betwixt the Sees of <hi>Rheims</hi> and <hi>Treves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sevently,</hi> Sometimes also the Competitors are preferred according as they produce their Commissions, as was done in the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> betwixt the Ambassadours of <hi>Portugal</hi> and <hi>Hungary</hi>; and the <hi>Polonians</hi> do frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Competitions between Ambassadours, prefer him who first enters their Territories, <hi>Bodin. de Repub. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eightly,</hi> Sometimes also the Competitors are ordained to give their suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage and preceed according to the respect due to the Nations, and not to the persons: as was decided in the Council of <hi>Constans</hi> and <hi>Basil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ninthly,</hi> It is observed that <hi>Octavius Farnesius</hi> Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> and <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centia,</hi> to shun the difference of Precedency betwixt his two Towns of <hi>Parma</hi> and <hi>Placentia,</hi> did write himself Duke of P.

the sixth to shun any debate that could have been between <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> assumed the title of <hi>King of Great Britain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tenthly,</hi> Some use to secure themselves against such contests by Protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which certainly do interrupt prescription, and preserve the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters right, <hi>L.</hi> 14. § 8. <hi>ff. de Relig.</hi> but in that case the protestation must be presently interposed, for protestations after the deeds contraverted are ended and past, are concluded to be of no value, <hi>Carpzol. def.</hi> 22. for protestations cannot be drawn back: But it has been doubted whether the person against whom the protestation is taken, does prejudge himself, when he does not protest in the contrar, for this seems to infer an acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>escence that the protestation is just, since <hi>qui tacet consentire videtur,</hi> and this is the occasion, why in our Judicatures when one protests, the other ordinarly protests in the contrare; But yet it is generally concluded that Silence in that case does not prejudge him against whom the protestation is taken, since he knows that in Law the protestation secures his right, <hi>Tusc. tom.</hi> 6. <hi>Conclus.</hi> 941.</p>
