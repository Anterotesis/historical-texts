            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

thouſand tun was forc'd to laver about, till in the night the wind comming about, and blowing a ſtiffe gale in his ſterne, he ſpoond before the waves, and by that it was cleare day light, ours had a view of the Daniſh Arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do, who fail'd on, as if they had notice, intended to fall over for the North coaſt of England, then to trouble the Coaſt of Holland. But on the deſcriall of our fleet, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay they prepar'd for fight, their admirall <hi>Erfurt</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding his navy into three ſquadrons, two wings him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in the midle with his muſters Royall ſhips, making as it were the body of his battell. <hi>Van Trumpe</hi> came on almoſt in the ſelfe ſame forme, onely his wings keepe cloſer to the maine of his Armado, and ſo with fearfull ſhouts on both ſides, the Danes as is their cuſtome, drinking large carrowces to make them more couragious, they ſent loud meſſages of death to each other, by thoſe fatall imbaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors, their great Ordnance, the Conſtables of our ſhips being far more experienc't markeſmen than the Daniſh gunners, none of thoſe fire-bals were ſent in raigne, but went either through and through the ſides of their veſſels, or light upon their maſts, ſplitting them, and ſhearing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder their tacklings, our light and nimble ſhips turning dexterouſly about, ſaluteng them with two broad ſides and ſinking ſome ſix of the right wing, the reſt ſhockt up to their Admirall. Who was not unmindfull nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his honour, nor to invade our navy, upon which he ſent out not in vaine, his great Artillery, which ſeemed to change the ſea into a flame, at laſt finding our Ordnance from our vice admirall <hi>Hans Hiem</hi> the ſon of that Peere <hi>Hiem</hi> that tooke in 29 the Spaniſh plate-fleete in the <hi>Iames.</hi> to gall him ſhrowdly twixt his decks, truſting to the multitude of his men, they being now within halfe musket ſhot he ran his ſword with much violence upon his ſterne, and grapling after a turne or two, his ſhip to that of <hi>Hans Hiem,</hi> he laid him abord with ſome kindred of his reſoluteſt Souldiers. When ſuddainly the murderers from the great Cabbine going off, and fire being given to the

traine under the falſe Decks, up flew thoſe Danes into the ayre diſmembred, and others by the Admirall being clapt on in their roomes, were with the Murderers from the Cooke-roome ſtraight cleared the Decks, and ſent thoſe Danes to drinke an everlaſting health with their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. The Admirall perceiving that there was likelyhood of taking that ſtrait ſhip, deſerted her, and tooke about to the ayd of his right wing, which under the command of the Duke of Holſtein was undertaken by <hi>Van Trump</hi> himſelfe, who like a right Neptune, as if he only would be Lord of thoſe waters, beſtirs himſelfe among the Danes, powring into their boſomes ſhowres of lead like haile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones, and throwing over pots of wilde fire and hard Granado's into their quarters and tacklings. You might have in an inſtant ſeen as it were a fiery contention for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority between thoſe two oppoſite Elements, fire and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the burning ſhips, as it were ſtriving to ſet fire upon the roomes: Which in ſcorne to be vanquiſhed in their proper dwellings, as the veſſels ſhould have ſuffered a double death, inſinuated into their holds, and ſinking them extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed the audacious flames; the ſame ſhips at one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant (ſtrange yet true) being burned and drowned, <hi>Van Trumpe</hi> boarding the Duke of Holſtein, was twice repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, rather by multitude then valour; thoſe Bacon-eating Danes wiſhing themſelves at home againe carowſing ſtrong waters; On the ſudden, were ſent to their long home, where they had plenty of liquor; deſtiny ſeeming to be courteous to them in affourding them plenty of that in their deaths which they had ſo doted on in their lives. <hi>Hans Hiem</hi> with the Rere-Admirall and his ſquadron, in the interim falling in upon <hi>Erfurts</hi> left wing, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of Lubecke mariners, they inſtantly cryed out for quarter, yeelding themſelves without ſtriking one ſtroake, with their ſluggiſh ſhips, to the number of ſix and thirty, a large thirſt of the Fleet; with which cowardly treachery of theirs, <hi>Erfurt</hi> amazed and diſcouraged would have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for his ſafety by fight; but he was as well ſurroun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

with enemies as waves, and therefore impoſſibilitated of his purpoſe, like a valiant ſouldier reſolves to fight it out, and ſet his life at as deare rate as poſſible, rather, then betray the truſt repoſed in him by his King, by betraying the ſhips Royall into the hands of his enemies, cheerfully therefore and ſuddenly hee made upon <hi>Van Trump</hi> charging his Ordnance great and ſmall; you might have ſeen there all the horrours incident to mortality, men lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping there from one to another, death, fire, water, and ſword, and all the Elements and Engines of deſtruction contriving their ruine. At laſt, by the ſingular skill and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of <hi>Van Trump,</hi> and the valour of <hi>Hiem</hi> and others, moſt of the Fleet that before threatened the Seas was ſunk or taken. The Duke of Holſtein ſeeing us goe to wracke, as <hi>Hiem</hi> informed, being in a good and ſtrong ſhip, vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly cut his paſſage through our Fleet, and eſcaped old <hi>Erfurt,</hi> after he and his ſouldiers had ſhewed as much va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour as ever was expreſſed, that Nation beholding his ſhip boarded, on all ſides ready to be taken, and himſelfe led into captivity, more deſperately then Chriſtianly getting downe into the Gun-roome, gave fire to thoſe veſſels of powder which were there; he blew himſelfe, ſouldiers and enemies that were then aboard, with his ſhip into pieces; that old Commander like <hi>Aiax,</hi> diſdaining that any ſhould conquer him but himſelfe; after which the reſt of the ſhips crying out for quarter, were received into the poſſeſſion of <hi>Van Trump,</hi> who now had a competent victory. Of all that great fleet not one eſcaped that I can heare of but the Duke of Holſtein, there being thirty ſixe ſunke and torne a pieces in the fight, and ſome ſixty taken and made prize of, we having not loſt above three ſhips, and thoſe not very conſiderable, and not above three hundred men, they foure thouſand, there being of mariners and ſouldiers betweene ſixe and ſeven thouſand priſoners. This is the true Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that great and fearefull battell, then which has not been fought a more conſiderable one to this State. The
