            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>WE the Deputies in the Generall Aſſembly of the Reformed Churches of France and the Principalitie of Bearn, perſecuted by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Eſtate and of their Religion, who abuſe the Kings mind and conſcience, ſeeing that to our great griefe we are conſtrained by the violence of oppreſſion to haue recourſe vnto naturall and lawfull meanes (by a neceſſarie defence) to preſerue the libertie of our conſciences and the ſafetie of our liues againſt theſe our implacable enemies: We proteſt in the name of the ſaid Churches before God and men, inuiolably to remaine vnder the ſubiection of our King, acknowledging that he is giuen vs of God to be our ſoueraigne Lord. And that all the world may take notice that as this obedience, next vnto the worſhip of God, is the onely aime of our intention, ſufficiently manifeſted by our former fidelitie ingrauen in the pillars of our Eſtate, and in the crownes of our late Kings, raiſed vp againe by our predeceſſors and our ſelues, notwithſtanding the endeuors of our enemies factions: alſo the hatred and perſecution which we now endure, is raiſed vp for no other cauſe by our enemies, but for this holy and iuſt action; whereunto they know we are inſeparably bound, by the rules of our
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:14707:3"/>
Religion, by the example of our progenitors, and the right of our owne conſeruation.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all then we beſeech the King and all true French men, as alſo all Kings, Princes and Potentates, friends and confederates of the Crowne, and generally all men who are touched with the zeale of Gods glorie, with commiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of innocencie troden vnder foote, and with griefe for the miſeries which at this day threaten France: to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme themſelues here of our iuſt complaints, that in them they may ſee the perfidiouſneſſe of our enemies and their crueltie, and which (whether we will or no) they pull out of our boſome, and binde vs to publiſh for the iuſtification of our innocencie, and to let all ſuch as loue iuſtice and truth ſee, that the refuge of our defence whereunto we are brought, is both neceſſary and iuſt; our enemies being thruſt forward by no other motiue to kindle the fire in this kingdome, then to put out the light of our Religion, and to ouerthrow the moſt ſure reſiſtance which in the Eſtate may be oppoſed to forrein enterpriſes. But becauſe by their wonted ſubtilties they haue here followed the common courſe which tends to violence and crueltie, making to themſelues a way by falſe accuſations to the oppreſſion of a iuſt cauſe. And for a pretence to inuade vs, they haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed vs rebels and ſeditious; and to ſpread euery where this accuſation, they employ the Edicts and declarations of the King and of the Parliaments, yea and the mouth of Ambaſſadours in forrein parts. To the end that the ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie of thoſe who are leaſt informed either of the hatred, or of the power, or of the craft of our enemies, might not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue ſome ſiniſter impreſſion of vs; touching the dutie of obedience and fidelitie towards our King and country: we will ſhew here that all the pretences and iniurious crimes wherewith they charge vs, are meerly artificiall diſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings borrowed as a veile to couer the outrages done to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie. For as to inflame the hatred of Kings and the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the people againſt the Goſpell, they haue heretofore accuſed the firſt Chriſtians, &amp; our fathers in theſe laſt times
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:14707:3"/>
of like crimes, namely that they tranſgreſſed againſt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees <note place="margin">Act. 17. 7.</note> of <hi>Ceſar,</hi> moued ſedition among the people, and did ouerthrow the royaltie of Princes. Vnder theſe ſuppoſed accuſations they haue cauſed them to ſuffer euery where the violence of the ſword, the burning of fire, the crueltie of maſſacres, the futie of warres, and the horror of all ſorts of exquiſite torments. It is true, that as our fathers were more weake and naked, or expoſed to a more eaſie ſlaughter, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion then was directly charged with theſe crimes, and then they haue perſecuted and made open war vpon them for their profeſſions ſake. But now by a ſubtiltie fitted to their intentions, our enemies haue altered the method. They enterpriſe warre vpon the perſons, to breake in vpon Rel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. And becauſe that after ſo many perfidious and cruell practiſes, the arme of God hauing raiſed vs vp, as out of our fathers aſhes, and by the miraculous proſperitie of the late King (conducted by our ſidelitie vpon the throne of this monarchie) the breaches of the Eſtate being repaired, that there might be eſtabliſhed a firme peace, an Edict was gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vs for the libertie of our conſciences, and places of ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to preſerue our goods and liues againſt the violence which the former euils made vs feare for the time to come: truly it were now too an apparent violating of peace, and they ſhould too manifeſtly declare themſelues enemies of the quiet of France, if openly this Edict made in fauour of vs, ſhould be reuoked, and it they ſhould make war vpon vs for Religion. It were alſo to ingage too many perſons in one ſelfe ſame cauſe. For theſe cauſes to couer their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected purpoſe of the ruine of this Eſtate through ours, to arme the King againſt vs, and to deſtroy vs with greater eaſe then other wiſe they could poſſibly do. They haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed vs rebels and offenders, they haue endeuoured to make this cauſe more particular; they call the warre they make vpon vs a chaſtiſement of ſeditious perſons. But when we ſhall haue here made plaine to the eyes of all the world the purpoſe of thoſe who are authors of theſe troubles and confuſions; the long oppreſſion we haue hitherto endured
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:14707:4"/>
with all patience; the euidences of our right in the courſe we haue held in our complaints, and moſt humble ſuites made to our King, now laid againſt vs as a crime: Laſtly y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> open perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which at this inſtant they inflict vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs by the armies already raiſed againſt vs in all the parts of this kingdome where they thinke we are able any way to reſiſt, We hope that we ſhall cleare our innocencie from theſe ſlanders, ſhall approue our iuſt and neceſſary defence, which we vndertake, waiting for the help and bleſſing of the Almightie. And finally we ſhall obtaine fauour and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance from all ſuch as loue his glorie and the truth: and the ſuccour and helpe of whoſoeuer they be that deſire the conſeruation of this poore kingdome.</p>

But not being able to promiſe to themſelues that the good inclinations of the King, and the wiſedome of his Mother then Regent, and all well affected Frenchmen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d in the peace of the kingdome, would conſent, or could ſuffer an open breach of the Edict, they ſought to gaine by peece-meale that which they could not obtaine in the whole ſumme: and by fleights and more ſecret pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes to cauſe things to fall into the gulfe, whereinto now they haue throwne them.</p>
            <p>The firſt groundworke of their plot did bewray it ſelfe with aſtoniſhment and iuſt apprehenſion of all of vs, when in the coronation of the King they made him take this oath: <hi>I will truly endeuour to my power to exclude from my iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction and lands vnder my ſubiection, all heretickes ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by the Church.</hi> As if he took his Crowne vnder this
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:14707:4"/>
condition and vnder this law, that he ſhould roote vs out when he could do it. The blood of that great <hi>Henrie</hi> crieth yet for vengeance for the furious and abominable murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, who proteſted and affirmed that the onely reaſon why he murthered him, was becauſe he was a fauourer of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, that he ſuffered them in his kingdome, that he put them not to the ſword: and here they haue cauſed his ſon and ſucceſſor, to promiſe that he ſhall employ all his power to roote vs out. By this powerfull and effectuall reaſon they did ingraue in the Kings heart from his moſt tender yeares the neceſſitie of hating and deſtroying vs; and beſides the horror of the example of his Father cruelly ſlaine for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining peace with thoſe who are called hereticks, they take of him a ſolemne promiſe to raigne and ſit vpon his throne vnder this condition to perſecute thoſe whom his father conſerued and kept. For who is ignorant that vnder the name of heretickes, they meane vs? That we are proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and ſtiled ſuch by the Roman Church? And therefore if the King be bound to the obſeruation of this oath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their intention, what may we not then feare? Wherefore vpon former experience ought we not to feare againe the vnhappie bloodſheds which ſuch impreſſions and impoſed neceſſities vpon the conſciences of Kings, haue cauſed vs to feele?</p>
            <p>The like proiect of our enemies hath yet openly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted it ſelfe, when endeuouring to make a fundamentall law to paſſe, and an vniuerſall principle of conſcience, that we ought not to be ſuffered in France; they obtained in the laſt Eſtates held at Paris, that the houſes of the Clergie and Nobilitie ſhould expreſly demaund by their roles the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of this oath of the King, as alſo the reception and publication thereof by the Councell of Trent. A Councell which hath bin heretofore reiected publikely by thoſe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates which were held when the moſt bloodie and violent troubles haue bin ſtirred vp againſt vs in this kingdome. A Councell which will not endure that Kings ſhould raigne, if they permit life and libertie in their dominions to thoſe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:14707:5"/>
who are called heretickes.</p>
            <p>But the moſt apparent and moſt ſenſible proceeding of the proiect of our malignant enemies, is principally fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by the ſeditious ſermons of the preaching Ieſuites and other Monkes, who, ſome yeares ſince, by an vnbridled licence and a manifeſt conſpiracie, contrary to the Edicts and their authoritie, did take vpon them to calumniate vs in their pulpits, and to make vs odious, preaching furie and ſedition, nouriſhing the people in hatred of vs, inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting them to haue vs in ex<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cration, and inſpiring in their mindes warres and murthers, do diſpoſe and prepare them vpon all occaſions to annoy vs. Hence it is that we conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually feele ſo many violatings of the Edicts of peace, ſo many br<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aches which are made in vpon our ſafetie, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny outrages againſt our libertie. Notwithſtanding we may yet boldly affirme, that our patience might haue ouercome and as it were ſmothered the greateſt part of theſe euils, or at leaſt we might haue conceiued ſome good hope that in the end ſome remedies would haue bin prouided for vs by the bountie of the King and the wiſedom of his moſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Counſellers, if the Ieſuites were not exalted to the height of power whereunto they are come. For it doth eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appeare, that by all ſorts of violent meanes they haue hitherto procured the rooting out of our Religion, and the ouerthrow of this Monarchie. Principally ſince their power hath growne to the proportion of their euill will, and that they ſee all obſtacles which heretofore were oppoſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their hardy enterpriſe to be now broken downe or to yeeld vnderneath their power: what other expectation is reſerued for vs, but to feele the danger wherinto ſo long a time they haue proiected to plunge vs? The miſerable face of Chriſtendom at this day almoſt rent in peeces with warres and horrible confuſions, doth manifeſt ſufficiently to all the world what power their wicked and artificiall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions haue to ſtirre vp a warre of Religion, almoſt vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall. And who can preſume that France alone (which they haue made ſo often to feele ſo mournfull wounds by

There is no man ſo vnacquainted with their deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeines, who hath not heretofore foreſeene or foretold, that the miſerie and ruine of France drew neare when the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of Ieſuites ſhould preuaile.

The feare of falling into theſe euils, hath cauſed vs to heare many aduertiſements from the wiſeſt and beſt affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed French men, which ſo long time haue withſtood it with all their power. The force of the Parliament of Paris hath oft oppoſed its authoritie againſt their enterpriſes. And the remarkable documents which the iudgement thereof hath ſpread throughout France ſoone after the death of the late King, touching the danger and pernicious conſequences to the Eſtate, if they attained to greater credit, did guide the wiſedome of the Kings Mother to reſtraine their ouerbold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in the Court and in the managing of affaires.

And euer ſince it hath appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the gouernment of the State, what power the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites haue gotten ouer the Kings affections.

            <p>All France may well remember, that three dayes after this Ieſuite had got the Kings eare, they cauſed his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell to cancell the Act of Parliament, by the which the opening of their Colledge in Paris was interdicted them, vntill ſuch time as they had publikly renounced their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the ruine of States and killing of Kings. And to ſhew that all oppoſition to their violence ſhould thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth be vaine, by an Order from the Councell (by them ſet vp in euery quarter of Paris in ſigne of triumph) they cauſed the Decrees of the Vniuerſitie (which had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what reſiſted them) to be annulled. With like facilitie, and at the ſame time, they obtained an Act in fauour of the Biſhops of Bearn the 25 of Iune 1617. for the reſtoring of all Eccleſiaſticall goods of that Country, which by a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne eſtabliſhment decreed by the Soueraigne and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, were ordained for the maintenance of our Paſtors, Colledge, Garriſons, Officers, and other charges of the country. 15 yeares together the Biſhops had followed this ſuite with all poſſible inſtance. The late King ſundry times ſollicited from Rome in their behalf, knowing wel the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of ſuch a change, bound alſo by his oath to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouate nothing (beſide the libertie of Exerciſe giuen to the Roman Catholicks, with reſtitution of ſo much Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall goods as was needfull for them, granted by Edict, and executed in the yeare 1599) had alwayes refuſed it them. The Queene mother of the King, for like conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and becauſe of the ſame oath taken by her Maieſtie now raigning, for the maintenance of the ancient eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (confirmed ouer and aboue by twelue ſeueral Patents
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:14707:6"/>
and Declarations obtained againſt the inſtance that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops made on the contrary) would not meddle with it. The proiect of our enemies could not be better aduanced then by a blow of this nature. For they knew that the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of this Reſtitution would draw after it (as, alas, it is come to paſſe) the ſubuerſion of the countrey, and the vtter ruine of our Religion in the ſame, with hope that with the ſparkles they ſhould kindle there, they might ſet all France on fire. Wherefore they drew the King by his conſcience, and by vrging his oath, touching the rooting out of all Religion contrary to his, to make that Decree by prerogatiue: which for this cauſe (though giuen raſhly, without the aduice of the principall Officers of the Crowne and State in a buſineſſe of ſuch conſequence, and againſt the courſe of Law vpon the onely purſuite of the Biſhops, without hearing the Deputies of the country) would neuer be called in, notwithſtanding all the remonſtrances and ſupplications that could ſince be preſented, which haue not bene otherwiſe anſwered, then that the authoritie and conſcience of the King ſtood engaged in it. Thence we ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered a wofull experience of the Kings inclination in thoſe affaires that moſt concerne his State and our ſafetie. Seeing that this Ieſuite held all his affections bound with reſpects of Religion, and that deuotion vnto which his Maieſtie out of an inbred goodneſſe is naturally giuen, was as a ſpring vnto his conſcience, by the which he incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth his whole will to what pleaſeth him beſt. Hee hath made himſelfe the Counſel of the Kings conſcience (to vſe his owne phraſe): and in this Counſell can he propound other Maximes then thoſe of Rome? that may be all redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to this head of the ſubuerſion of this State and our ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine. He giues him for a law the determination of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Conſtance; <hi>That faith is not to be kept with hereticks.</hi> That whatſoeuer Edicts he hath made or ſworne, bind him not. That therefore he may, nay that he ought to br<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ake them. And the better to induce him, he reades him no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lecture then the oath of his Coronation. Propounds
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:14707:7"/>
him no greater merit to be rewarded with Paradiſe, then the rooting out of Heretickes. Incites him to ſeeke that way a more glorious renowne, then euer S. <hi>Lewis</hi> got by warring with the Infidels. Theſe and ſuch like are the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of conſcience of this Ieſuite. By the which his Maieſtie ſetting aſide all other conſiderations of his gouernment, hath let himſelfe be caried away, and hath often ſaid, <hi>It is better to loſe his Eſtate then his ſoule.</hi> Taught (it ſeemes) to hold it for a Maxime, that there are occaſions of ſauing his ſoule with the loſſe of his kingdome. Now from the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the Kings will, encloſed thus within the hand of the Ieſuites, they haue drawne to themſelues by a neceſſary conſequence, the whole gouernment of the State. Which they haue compaſſed the eaſier, by reaſon that all the ſage and old Counſellors and Officers that ſerued the late King, and France, in the eſtabliſhment and maintenance of the proſperitie and greatneſſe which it was raiſed to vnder his reigne, being now (as we ſee) put from all managing of affaires; they to whom the Kings abundant ſauour giues all authoritie in the gouernment, do willingly conſent, that the directing of the Counſell be committed to the Popes Sollicitors, Cardinals and Biſhops. And ſuch as yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, or as are newly brought in, ſome nurtured with the leuen of old Spaniſh factions and affections, others won with the aduantageous liberalities of the new, or with Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh honours (whereof the Ieſuites are the chiefe brokers) concurre all together in one and the ſame conſent, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſubuerſion of whatſoeuer the late King had eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, but chiefly for ſo much as concernes vs. And theſe allurements haue bene of ſuch efficacie, that he from whom the beſt expected an vnvariable affection to peace and good gouernment, in hope of a Church-dignitie, hath deuoted himſelfe to be an inſtrument of the firſt breach, through which, perſecution hath ruſhed in vpon vs. On the other ſide, the high and inferious Courts, and all Magiſtrates of the kingdome are filled with ſuch perſons as are wholy ſubiected to them, either by ſuperſtition, or by intereſt of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:14707:7"/>
fortune. The people haue no other affections then ſuch as they ſuggeſt vnto them by their ſermons or by their priuate confeſſions.</p>
            <p>The power then of our enemies being ſuch, we haue <note place="margin">How hardly we are dealt withal</note> alſo, to our dammage, felt the effects of it by a contrary vſage to that that we found vnder the late King. For ſince they haue got this authoritie (we might very well ſay, ſince their reigne) there is no more fauour nor acceſſe at Court for thoſe of our Religion. Many to whom their fathers ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices and their owne had thitherto preſerued them the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of ſome places neare the King, haue bene put by them. The greater part are conſtrained to rid themſelues of them, vnder this command, <hi>Change your Religion, or leaue your Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</hi> It is told them that the King cannot with a good eye ſee the Huguenots about his perſon. In the Priuie Councel our greateſt oppoſites are our Iudges; and they whom we petition, are our ſworne enemies. We are ſhut out of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in all Courts higher or lower, againſt the freedome of the Statutes. If any one that is now in place turnes of our Religion, preſently the Attourneys Generall or their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes oppoſe his ſitting. The Courts conteſt with him, and repulſe him. And how many are there in the Court of Parliament at Paris and elſewhere, who are detained from comming to vs by the oppreſſion of this libertie? But when ſhould we haue reckoned vp all the kindes of iniuries done vnto vs? The ſeditious inſolencies dayly committed to hinder the free exerciſe of our Religion in thoſe places where we are tollerated. The attempts and enterpriſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch places as haue bin giuen vs in cuſtody for our ſecuritie. The ſecret practiſes to debauch the Gouernours of them, as it is newly confirmed in the Gouernours of Clermont, Ledeue and Argenton. The refuſall of proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for the reſtitution of thoſe places. The riots and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages that thoſe of our Religion ſuffer in citie and country by the fury of the people, prouoked by their Preachers. The rauages and firing of our Churches and Church-yards. The inhumanities exerciſed in digging vp our dead, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:14707:8"/>
their buriall. The violence offered ſick-folkes conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, euen in the agony of death, thereby to force them to renounce their Religion. The crueltie exerciſed on our poore and ſicke, who are caſt out of Hoſpitals. The vniuſt force practiſed in robbing vs of our children to bring them vp in the Roman Religion, againſt their fathers intent and laſt will. To be ſhort, all maner of wrongs and violences are done vs, againſt the Kings authoritie, and publik peace and tranquillitie.</p>
            <p>In all theſe miſchiefes we haue no other recourſe then to our complaints, which we continually direct to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, either of the Prouinces or of the high Courts. But there, alas, in ſtead of remedies we finde poiſon. For not onely they ſend vs backe, and doe vs no right; but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtice wherewith they aggrauate the former iniury, aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments their boldneſſe that did vs the wrong, encouraged by their impunitie, and by the law that they gather from the Iudges themſelues.</p>
            <p>Our laſt refuge is to the Kings iuſtice and Officers of State, whither (forced by the hard vſage we finde euery <note place="margin">Our procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, which now is imputed vnto vs as a crime.</note> where) we flie as to our ſanctuary: and there our enemies oppoſe our acceſſe with their vtmoſt violence. They per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that the Kings protection would defend vs againſt all their iniuries. They know that our courſe by complaints, which nature opens vnto euery one, would ſhroud vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the couert of his iuſtice, where both our reſt and the publike tranquillitie ſhould be preſerued. And therefore we finde their conſpiracie to be the more malicious. For not onely they ſtop his Maieſties eare, and barre vs from all paſſage thereunto; but when we offer to approach it by our moſt humble petitions and requeſts, they lay for vs by a more then diuelliſh ſubriltie, the ſnare of their calumnie, to make vs fall into the blame of a pretended diſobedience. They turne our complaints into crimes: they terme vs ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious and rebels. This is the accuſation for the which they purſue vs criminally. This is the accuſation, for the which they now perſecute vs. We here call heauen and earth to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:14707:8"/>
witneſſe betweene our enemies and vs, deſiring that the procedure of our complaints to his Maieſtie, which we wil here truly and fully lay open, being knowne to all, men may iudge of our innocencie, and of the calumnie of their accuſation; and finally of the vniuſt warre and perſecution which our aduerſaries vnder this pretext haue raiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs.</p>
            <p>For the maintaining of the Edict of peace and reparation of the breaches thereof, the late King did eſtabliſh accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his equitie an order among vs, by the which we might from time to time with his permiſſion and grant aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble our ſelues by Deputies out of all the Prouinces, to tender him our complaints of all ſuch grieuances as might be done vs, and receiue from his bountie reaſonable an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, and ſuch as ſhould be neceſſary for the keeping of his Edicts. According to this order, feeling a more vrgent neceſſitie then euer, we addreſſed our ſelues vnto his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie by our Deputies generall in the yeare 1619, and it pleaſed his Maieſtie to grant vs, according to our moſt humble requeſt, a Briefe, by the which we were permitted to aſſemble ourſelues in the Citie of Loudun the 25 of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember. <note place="margin">The Aſſembly of Loudun,</note> Where being met together out of all the Prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the kingdome and Soueraigntie of Bearn, our bils of complaints being drawne, we preſented them in all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie to his Maieſtie, beſeeching him that by a fauourable anſwer to the principall articles and moſt important grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uances they might carry backe into all the Prouinces, by the teſtimonials of his good will towards our protection, ſome aſſurance to his ſubiects of the Religion, againſt ſo many threats and feares as doe apparently inuiron them. There would neuer be an end, if we ſhould here diſplay the ſeuerall heads of all thoſe complaints.

That iuſtice could not be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained for the exceſſiue outrages done to ſome of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion at Baugenci, and for ringing the Allarum bell againſt them; and that the Offenders that threw two men out of a garret, and ran one of them through with a ſword, haue bin heard as witneſſes to the informations made by the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Generall in the iuriſdiction of Orleans; and that though the cauſe was referred to the Parliament of Paris, yet notwithſtanding the Attourney Generall in the ſame hath let the ſuite fall.

And in caſe theſe promiſes were not performed within the time, it ſhould be lawfull for vs to meete againe, to re-demand iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of his Maieſtie vpon our grieuances. Now becauſe that vpon the condition of theſe promiſes, vpon the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance with the which they were ſet forth vnto vs, and vpon the true intent promiſed in the performance of the ſame, dependeth the maine iuſtification of our procedure follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for the which we are vniuſtly declared faultie, and dealt withall by the rigor of armes; let all the world ſee here vpon what ground we build our ſinceritie and plaine mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and what right we had to reaſſemble our ſelues. For confirmation of the promiſe made vs to this purpoſe, we were ſhewed that it was the very firſt thing the King on his word promiſed to his ſubiects of the Religion, ſince he came to the Crowne. The Lord Conſtable, added that his comming in betweene, would be worth Briefes vnto vs, and happily more. The King himſelfe out of his owne mouth confirmed it ſince at Fontainebleau to the Deputies that certified the King of our ſeparation, in preſence of the Lord Duke <hi>de Leſdiguieres,</hi> who had aſſured vs as much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Had it now bin lawfull for vs to deſire or imagine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny better licence then the Kings ſacred word, the firſt that euer he gaue vs?

And certainly we ſhould haue held our ſelues vnworthy of our Kings fauour, and iniuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to his authoritie, if we had required greater aſſurance for this permiſſion then his owne word. Thus our Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly broke vp the 13 of April, 1620. after an Act drawne among vs of our obedience, containing all conditions and promiſes aforeſaid, with order giuen to thoſe of Rochell for the calling of another Congregation, if need ſhould be, in ſuch a place as they ſhould thinke moſt conuenient. The
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:14707:11"/>
Deputies, after they had withdrawne themſelues, and giuen account in the Prouinces, were continued, or others ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to them, to meete together againe, in caſe of vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of things granted according to the condition of the promiſes. This was done in all the Prouinces openly, to his Maieſties knowledge and the Lords of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell. It was not miſliked. The King made no declaration to the contrary. And yet this is moſt certain, that if there were any enterpriſe or attempt againſt the Kings authoritie, it was the nomination of the Deputies. But as that was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged lawfull by permitting it, becauſe of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: ſo alſo our Deputies Generall ſuing the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of things promiſed, did nor ſticke to adde alwayes this remonſtrance to the Lords of the Councell; <hi>Do vs iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and ſaue vs the labour of another meeting.</hi> The Prince his Highneſſe being diuers times preſent in Parliament to confirme the Kings command for the admiſſion of the Councellors, ſhewed vnto them the permiſſion we had to reaſſemble our ſelues, which they themſelues occaſioned by their refuſall.</p>
            <p>Now the prefixt time of ſixe moneths for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of promiſes expiring, the 13. of October, without <note place="margin">The execution of the order of reſtitution in Bearn anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and an alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration made in the country of the ſuretie and libertie in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</note> any effect, the King being gone into Guyenne in Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, was ſollicited by our enemies to enioyne thoſe of Bearn to execute the order of Reſtitution, and to confirme it in the Parliament of Pau. The terme agreed vpon for their remonſtrances, which his Maieſtie promiſed to heare from the mouth of their Deputies, extended to the 13. of Nouember: which cauſed the Parliament of Pau. vpon the Kings command, to order that the Deputies ſhould make their remonſtrances to his Maieſtie, within the time agreed vpon (confirmed again by a letter dated the 21 of Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber from his Maieſtie to the ſaid Parliament) otherwiſe the time being expired, the order of Reſtitution ſhould be confirmed. His Maieſtie not contented with this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, before the remonſtrances of thoſe of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try were heard, was put on by our enemies to go him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:14707:11"/>
thither. And although the Parliament by a ſecond De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of confirmation, had preuented his Maieſties coming; yet through the induction of our enemies, he entred into the country with his armie.</p>
            <p>We would here willingly conceale the diſloyaltie of our enemies, and the cruelties there practiſed by their induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, if their calumnious accuſations and the bitter an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of our miſeries did not now conſtraine vs to open our mouthes for our owne iuſtification, and to call on ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance before God and men. We will not ſpeake of the alteration made in the country, by the vniting of it to the Crowne of France, though it be euident it was not ſo much for any aduantage to France, as to make way for the alteration of our Religion. We will onely touch in few words ſo much as hath bin done directly for the ruine of the Goſpel. The King then being at Nauarenx, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing to keepe his promiſe with <hi>Monſieur de Sales,</hi> made firſt at Bourdeaux, and ſince confirmed in the country, that he would ſtill maintaine him in the gouernment of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, in conſideration of his long ſeruices, and the ready o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience he ſhewed by all manner of ſubmiſſion vnto his Maieſtie: yet for all this, vrged by our enemies to take the gouernment from him and giue it to a Papiſt, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held by the religion of his promiſes, the Ieſuite that is ſtill at his elbow interpoſing his counſell of conſcience (or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without conſcience) perſwaded his Maieſtie that it was lawfull for him to breake his promiſe, by an equiuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, truly deſeruing the indignation of God and men. <hi>Your promiſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Sir, is either of State or conſcience. Of conſcience</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it cannot be, for it is contrary to the good of the Church. Seeing then it is of State, your Maieſtie ought to beleeue your Counſellours, who ſhew you, that for the good of your ſeruice, it is neceſſary that this place be no longer in the power of an Huguenot.</hi> Thus the King led by the Maiſter of his conſcience, who will be a ſuretie for him to God for all he ſhall do by his counſell, commanded <hi>Monſieur de Sales</hi> forthwith to reſigne his gouernment to <hi>Monſieur de Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ane</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:14707:12"/>
ſworne enemie to thoſe of our Religion. And then the Towne-gariſon being firſt remoued, and the inhabitant diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed, there were brought in foure hundred ſouldiers Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts vnder <hi>Monſieur de Poyanes</hi> command. This done, to take away all that might yet any wayes ſecure thoſe of the Religion, the ſix Captaines of the Parſans were caſſiered, and the Townes of Sauueterre, Orthes, Oleron and Nai filled with Papiſt-gariſons. The King being come the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time to Pau, gaue the Biſhops the preſidencie in the Aſſembly of Eſtates there called, that ſo they might ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſway the whole country. And God grant he trie not the ſame experiment of their perfidie that chaſed his father thence in his infancie; and that the neighbour-enemies practiſes finde not in them a ready way into France through that doore where our fidelitie hath alwayes beene a bulwarke. Now that no part of the ſecuritie and libertie of our Religion might remain vnviolated, the Papiſts were made maſters of all our Churches, notwithſtanding the condition of the reſtitution it ſelfe, bearing this reſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the Churches ſhould remaine ours till ſuch time as others were prouided vs. Theſe alterations made out of hate to our Religion, and to baniſh it the country, ſo aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented their boldneſſe who are continually taught and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited to miſchiefe vs, that whereas reſpect of the Kings pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence ſhould haue reſtrained them, yet their licentiouſneſſe ſo ouerflowed, that whereſoeuer they came, our Churches could not be ſaued from infinite rauages and ſcandals, ſo far, that euen within the Citie of Pau (the King himſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there) after they had broken downe the pulpit and ſeates of the Church, they burned publikly the Bible and New Teſtament. The Miniſters were in diuers places out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, and diuers perſons conſtrained againſt, their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences to kneele to Proceſſions. The ouerplus of the inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences, violences and riots that this poore Country endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, was innumerable, and ſuch as the moſt ſauage enemies could exerciſe in the midſt of a conqueſt. Hereupon for triumph <hi>Arnoux</hi> makes a booke, titled, <hi>The King in Bearn;</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:14707:12"/>
where, not able to containe himſelfe for ioy to ſee his deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeignes ſo forward, he plainly ſhewes how far he purpoſeth they ſhall entend, and what we muſt expect will be the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quele of them. The King (by his reckoning) is not to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe till he hath quite extinguiſhed the Religion that hee ſo much abhorreth: and highly extolling him for this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement and purſuit of the deſſigne, aboue the late King his father; leaues to be vnderſtood that the death of that good King hauing bin haſtned for refuſing to do as much; his Maieſtie is to looke for more fauourable vſage at their hands ſo long as he will continue.</p>
            <p>Bearn brought to this pitifull eſtate, the King vpon his returne left part of his army in Guyenne, and ſcattered the reſt in Poictou, filling all our Churches with terror: And thenceforth no talk but of the ruine of all Huguenots. All the diſcourſe at Court is of the ſiege of Rochell. They ſay, it is not a three moneths matter; they ſtay but for weather. In the meane while all the promiſes made at Loudun be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neglected, the time paſt, and nothing performed, (ſaue the deliuery of the Briefe for the keeping of places) not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the earneſt purſuit of our Deputies Generall all this while; the congregation of Deputies nominated by the Prouinces (and bound to meet to preſent their requeſts to his Maieſtie vpon the vnperformance of promiſes) as called at Rochell againſt the 25 of Nouember. We will not omit that after the alterations made in Bearn, the Towne of Leytoure was reſtored to a Gentleman of the Religion; but let all in different perſons iudge, whether a Papiſt gariſon being left-there, and, againſt the order of the former go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of the Towne, a Lieutenant eſtabliſhed, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer had the approbation of the Synod of the Prouince, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the intent of his Maieſties Briefe for the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of places of ſafetie, this be the ſquare dealing that was promiſed vs. Againe, we leaue it to be iudged, whether af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that the ſafetie of a whole country hath bin wreſt<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

We endeuor to preſent vnto the King our moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble remonſtraces, to purge vs of the falſe accuſations and crimes laid vpon vs by our aduerſaries, who abuſe the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of his name to breake his word with vs. To ſhew vnto his Maieſtie the vrgent neceſſitie of our iuſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints: To beſeech him in all humilitie that it would pleaſe him to deliuer our Churches from ſo many alarums and frights as do now enuiron them on all ſides. In a word, that he would ſhew himſelfe our Protector againſt ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent an oppoſition as is generally practiſed againſt vs ouer all his kingdome, to the preiudice of the authoritie of his Edicts, and againſt the open threats of our ruine, which by the example of the calamities of Bearn are made more fearfull. But we finde that our enemies had ſtopt his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties eares againſt all our requeſts, which are reiected; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will any thing be receiued or heard on our ſide. And at the ſame time we are criminally arraigned in Parliaments and other Courts of iuſtice. This Towne and all of vs are threatened with warre, as rebels and ſeditious perſons. Whereupon iudging by experience of what is paſt, and by our enemies method, which to our coſt we haue but too well learned and experimented, that this accuſation and theſe, threats were to authorize a refuſall and demall of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:14707:13"/>
and to make vs loſe all hope of euer obtaining any thing hereafter in our moſt iuſt and neceſſary complaints; we inſiſt at ſeueral times on the iuſtification of our innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and continue to beſeech his Maieſtie, and to lay downe our moſt humble petitions at his feete. But as all acceſſe is interdicted vs, and that to bring our proceedings into ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred euen with thoſe of our owne ſide, and to ſaue diuiſion in our Churches, our enemies cauſed it to be told our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties Generall and diuers others among vs, that the King, though reſolued to heare nothing from vs, would notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding deale fauourably with his ſubiects of the Religion, and do them iuſtice. That he was willing to heare our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints by the Deputies Generall, and in the name of the Churches. To trie what would be the effect of theſe words, we ceaſſe all purſuite in our owne name, are ſilent, and put it ouer wholy to our Deputies Generall, to follow it in their owne name and in the name of the Churches. And certainly we may boldly adde, that if the eſtate of our cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities increaſing daily, and threatning worſe, had not aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented our apprehenſion and iuſt miſtruſt, ouercome with ſo many vexations, repulſes, threats, and with deſpaire of any ſucceſſe, we could deſire nothing more then to retire our ſelues; and it may be our Churches would haue pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vs. But at the ſame time the fraud of our enemies did further diſcouer it ſelfe, and the perſecution proiected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs, breaking out in diuers places, hath manifeſted their deſſignes by ſo many perfidies and outrages, that being forced for iuſtification of our innocencie and lawfull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence againſt the warre they make vpon vs, here to lay o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen their proceedings before the eyes of all the world, we would be ſcrupulous for the honour of France to publiſh deeds ſo odious, if withall it were not knowne that the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of them are France's greateſt enemies, and haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired her ruine and ours.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all, vnder colour of theſe faire promiſes, that the the King would keepe his Edicts made in fauour of his ſubiects of the Religion, and would ſatisfie their complaints

of vnperformance of promiſes, my Lord Duke <hi>de Leſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guieres</hi> is drawne to the Court, by perſwading him that his mediation would be a great furtherance vnto the buſineſſe, and all the Lords and perſons of greateſt note among vs are entertained with the ſame hopes.

and more ouer hauing diſpatched diuers new commiſſions, dated the morow after <hi>Sieur de Reaux</hi> his ariuall there, he aſſiegeth Vals another place of ours in Viuarets, where e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the ſaid <hi>Sieur de Reaux</hi> himſelfe, whiles <hi>Monſieur de Chaſtillon</hi> reſted vpon his word, that <hi>Monſieur de Montmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renci</hi> ſhould performe couenants, aſſiſted in perſon, and was ſpectator of the battery. This little and weake place, without any defence but the inhabitants, hauing endured a hundred cannon ſhot, yeelding vpon honorable compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, directly contrary to the capitulation all manner of cruelties, violences and barbariſmes haue bin there practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vpon an infinite company of poore innocent perſons cruelly murthered or rauiſhed. And againe, contrary to the ſaid articles the like hath bin done at Valons a place neare vnto the other. Theſe frauds and breaches of counterfeit contracts, do manifeſt vnto the world that the Kings word and apparent command, haue bin vſed but as a ſnare for our plaine meaning, and vnder a ſecret approbation of all that <hi>Monſieur de Montmorenci</hi> ſhould doe to the contrary, to make vs loſe thoſe places.</p>
            <p>Moreouer at the ſame time <hi>Monſieur de Poyane</hi> hauing fortified himſelf in Bearn to beate out <hi>Monſieur de la Force, Monſieur de la Saladie</hi> is ſent from the King to <hi>Monſieur de la Force</hi> to command him to diſmiſſe thoſe troupes that he kept by him for his owne ſafetie and to maintain the Kings authoritie in his charge of Gouernour of the country a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the violent enterpriſes of the ſaid <hi>Sieur de Poyane.</hi> But the ſaid <hi>Sieur de la Saladie</hi> in ſtead of carying backe <hi>Monſieur de la Forces</hi> anſwer to the King, as he ſeemed, went into Guyenne to <hi>Meſſieurs d'Eſpernon, de Vignoles,</hi> and diuers others to arme, ſo that in an inſtant all Guyenne was filled with troupes, beſides thoſe that were left there before.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, at the ſame inſtant the troupes left in Poictou drew neare vnto this Citie and S. Iohn d'Angely. And by order from the Councell all Courts of Audit for Receits were remoued from all our places of ſafetie, where
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:14707:15"/>
they were eſtabliſhed; a palpable argument that though the citie of Rochell onely was threatned, yet all the reſt were aimed at, by a generall deſſigne of warre againſt vs ready to be put in execution; this remouall being to no other end, then to take from vs the meanes of helping our ſelues with thoſe profits in our owne defence when the perſecution ſhould come, which by conſequent they inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded againſt vs.</p>
            <p>Now as by theſe new alterations of our peace by theſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces, by the open oppreſſion &amp; perſecution in ſo many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, we did foreſee well enough the ſtorme y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hung ouer our heads and ready to fall, knowing beſides y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our enemies puft vp with their ſucceſſe in the rauage &amp; deſolation of Bearn, did ſtay for nothing but a fit ſeaſon to continue our ruine by an open warre; which was too eaſie to be learnd by their open talke, vpon the returne from Bearn, of the ſiege of Rochell, of the meanes and facilitie of taking it. By the diſcourſe which the King was hourely entertained with of the ruine of Huguenots: by the calumnies laid vpon vs for a pretext; by the threats that followed; and by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations viſibly made for that purpoſe. Neuertheleſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was ſome ſpeech of the Kings good will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his ſubiects of the Religion, and the authoritie of his Edicts, our Deputies Generall (to whoſe charge the whole purſuite was referred) preſented vnto his Maieſtie a bill of complaints, requeſting ſatisfaction for ſome of the moſt important grieuances, with a ſpeedier execution for the peace and ſafetie of our Churches.</p>
            <p>But after many inſtances and delayes, after diuers ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and ſupplications of all the chiefeſt among vs, euen of the Lord Duke <hi>de Leſdiguieres</hi> himſelf preſent at Court, our Deputies generall could neuer obtaine any anſwer.

               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:14707:15"/>
did perſwade himſelfe (for the King, howſoeuer our Churches were giuen to hope that he would maintaine his Edicts, did not here ſo much as paſſe his word, neither by mouth, nor by any Officer of State) that if we would firſt ſeparate our ſelues, we ſhould obtaine the retraite of troupes from all places where we did miſtruſt them. That the gouernment of the places in Dauphine ſhould be ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and deliuered vs in ſix moneths if it could be found.

And moreouer, that he was promiſed aſſuredly that nothing ſhould be attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted during the time that ſhould be requiſite for the returne of our reſolutions. But as we were about them, we were informed by <hi>Monſieur de Chalas</hi> the other of our Deputies generall, that the next day after, contrary to the ſaid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, our enemies had wrought the King to an abſolute and open reſolution of making warre againſt vs. That or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was giuen for the leuying of an armie of one and forty thouſand foote and ſix thouſand horſe. And that the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of Bearn was taken from <hi>Monſieur de la Force,</hi> and giuen to Monſieur the Marſhall de Themines, and the office of Captaine of the Guard, which his ſonne <hi>Monſieur be Marquis de la Force</hi> had, was giuen to the Marquis <hi>de Mauny,</hi> and that <hi>Monſieur de Manpauillan</hi> another of his ſonnes was commanded to leaue the Court.</p>

It happened in the citie of Tours the 19 of April laſt, that one <hi>Martin le Noir,</hi> (not long afore conuerted to our Religion, for the which he ſuffered many iniuries and reproches, ſo farre, that the people hauing made an effigie of ſtraw, and ſometimes cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

it by his name, ſometimes by the name of <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> did burne it publikly, and no iuſtice could euer be obtained for ſo outragious an inſolence) died: and as he was caried to his graue, the people made a head, and after they had abuſed his corpſe and thoſe that accompanied it, after they had committed all ſorts of indignities and in humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the digging vp of his graue, ſeeking to do worſe, ſtirred a more violent ſedition. So that hauing broken down and razed a houſe neare the Church-yard, they run to the Church, being halfe a mile thence, they fire it, they enter the Sextons houſe, and they pill and ranſacke it; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing increaſed to the number of a fearfull multitude, they continue three whole dayes together in firing and pulling downe our Church, without the Magiſtrates interpoſition, and comming too late he was not able to repreſſe ſo raging a violence. From thence the example of this ſedition paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth preſently vnto the Towne of Poictiers, where the people tranſported with like furie, haue razed to the very ground the walls of the Church-yard where they of the Religion bury their dead, broke and battered all the ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, and had committed the like violence vpon the Church, if the more carefull Magiſtrate had not ſtopped their courſe.</p>
            <p>Now the order of our enemies counſels and actions hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, and chiefly theſe tragicall and horrid vprores, the great preparatiues for warre, the vniuſt and rigorous dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with <hi>Monſieur de la Force</hi> and his ſonnes, contrary to the late aſſurance, with the croupes ready vnder <hi>Monſieur d'Eſpernons</hi> command for the inuaſion of Bearn, witneſſed and ſhewed ſufficiently, that he houre of a generall perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution was come, and that the deſſigne of our ruine ſo long a hatching now appeared. Wherefore our enemies, that their perfidies might play their part and performe their vtmoſt, promiſe that the King will ſee iuſtice done vpon the ſedition of Tours; and to take away all ſuſpition elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, or to lull aſleepe the more confident ſort, they cauſe a declaration to be confirmed in all Courts of Parliament

the 27 of April, ſhewing that though the King would cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſe ſome of his ſubiects of the Religion (ſuch as are ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med rebels and ſeditious) yet he meant and promiſed to keepe his Edicts with the reſt as long as they ſhould remain in their obedience, and that he would maintaine and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue their libertie and ſafetie according to the contents of the Edicts. And finally they aſſure <hi>Monſieur de la Force,</hi> that if he would leaue Bearn, he ſhould no ſooner ſend <hi>Monſieur d'Eſpernon</hi> word of it, but he ſhould preſently withdraw himſelfe. Now we will ſhew what was the effect of theſe promiſes. We will begin with the laſt, which was firſt violated. After <hi>Monſieur de la Force</hi> had with drawne himſelfe, and had certified <hi>Monſieur d'Eſpernon</hi> of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arming and retrait by the Baron <hi>d'Arros,</hi> preſently <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur d'Eſpernon</hi> entred the country with his armie, and ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed all townes and places where they of our Religion were moſt in number, filled them with ſtrong gariſons, razed the Caſtle of Montanay, and brought the people to ſuch a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable eſtate, that moſt of them, yea the chiefeſt haue bin forced to flie to quit their goods and country; diuers vnarmed and naked perſons were murthered, and the reſt remaine at this preſent reſtrained vnder a miſerable ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, ſuffering all ſorts of iniuries and cruelties. On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, the King ſetting forward for the execution of the menaces publiſhed againſt this Citie, after he had ſpred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad his aſſurances, that he went not againſt his ſubiects of the Religion in generall, and made particular promiſes to the Gouernours of ſome of our places of ſafetie, that comming to them he would innouate nothing, paſſing by Tours, where the ſedition being renewed and growne ſtronger, and the Commiſſarie ſent to execute iuſtice, dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen out of the Towne, the priſoners fetcht out of priſon by violence, the houſes of thoſe of our Religion (who frighted with the firſt tumult had withdrawne themſelues) pild and ranſackt, onely the Kings reuerence violated, hath with much ado bin expiated by the execution of fiue poore beggerly rogues; (and that yet to entertaine their credulitie
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:14707:17"/>
whom our enemies would feed with hope that the keeping of Edicts ſhould be continued.) His Maieſtie came to Sau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur, where <hi>Monſieur du Pleſſis</hi> relying vpon the expreſſe promiſes made him, that nothing ſhould be altered in the gouernment, and vpon the truth of the Declaration pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed three weekes before, hauing opened the gates of the Citie and Caſtle to the King, experimented to our great dammage the frauds and perfidies of our enemies, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the King to take away the gouernment from him, and to put a gariſon of foure hundred ſouldiers of his Gard in the Caſtle, and another in the Fauxbourg' of the greene Croſſe, and by this meanes to make vs loſe this place of ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. With what horror and indignation can all France ſee the enemies of her peace and the Kings ſeruice abuſe thus perfidiouſly his name and word to commit theſe ſo deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſloyalties? It is but ten moneths ago that by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties expreſſe grant, the keeping of places of ſafetie was continued vnto vs for foure yeares. Of all others, the citie of Saumur was one of the moſt important for our ſafetie. It had bin in our cuſtody euer ſince the late King being King of Nauarre, requeſted by <hi>Henrie</hi> the third, came accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with thoſe of our Religion to deliuer him from the captiuitie and tyrannie of the leagne. That Towne was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him for his paſſage; and it remained thenceforth in our keeping, as a token of our good ſeruices and fidelitie to this Crowne. This place ſeated on the Loire was to ſerue vs, in the perſecutions and confuſions which the enemies of this Eſtate haue now ſtirred vp, for a retrait or commodious paſſage for ſo many poore diſtreſſed flocks, to ſaue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues from the future furie of fire and ſword. This Towne during the peace of theſe later yeares, was a nurſery of the Church, and was the ſeate of a flouriſhing Vniuerſitie. For theſe cauſes our enemies crueltie hath cauſed the King to begin this warre, in the which they carry him headlong a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs, by this terrible blow, ſo great, that to giue it vs with greater facilitie, all the precedent calumnies, all the pretexts of diſobedience and rebellion, all the particular
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:14707:17"/>
declarations againſt our Aſſembly and this Citie, all frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulent declarations and promiſes made in fauour of ſuch as ſhould remaine in their obedience to the King haue bin ſet on foote. For can it be ſaid, that <hi>Monſieur du Pleſſis,</hi> whoſe long and faithfull ſeruices done to the late King and his Maieſtie now reigning, are knowne to all men, ſhould haue committed any act of diſobedience or rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion? Nay rather did he not paſſe all meaſure of confidence in the diſloyaltie of our enemies, out of his reſpect to the Kings bare name? And hoping to auoide the ſtorme that hung apparently ouer our heads, did he not himſelfe pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the benefit of that deceitfull declaration; and to make the firſt triall of it, opened with ſuch confidence the gates of the Towne and Caſtle to the King? Wherefore the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne being thus vnmasked, our enemies were now pleaſed to manifeſt that it was intended againſt all in generall. For as ſoone as the King was at Saumur, newes came how that all the Proteſtants throughout all the principall cities of Normandie were diſarmed. Were they alſo traitors? Or haue they ſince the Declaration committed any act of rebellion or diſobedience? Beſides all this, whiles the King was yet at Saumur, <hi>Monſieur Arnaut</hi> comes to S. Iohn d'Angely on Saturday the 15 of this moneth, to command the Lord Duke de Rohan and <hi>Monſieur de Soubize</hi> to come to the King, who deſired their aduice for the taking vp of the preſent affaires. This was done to two ends: firſt, that vnder hope of iuſtice, the great ones and common people of our Religion might be withheld as they haue bin hitherto, whiles the preparatiues for warre againſt vs were euery where a haſtening. Secondly and chiefly, that there might be the leſſe ſuſpition of the Kings troupes led by <hi>Monſieur d' Auriac,</hi> who the very next day entring the ſuburbes of S. Iohn with three thouſand and fiue hundred men, aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the towne and gates, and would haue gone further, and taken it, if he had not found reſiſtance. Was this Towne al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo guiltie of treaſon? Could the Towne be guiltie, and not the Lords of it? And yet the King writes to Monſieur the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:14707:18"/>
Duke de Rohan, as to his faithfull and affectionate ſeruant and his Lieutenant Gouernour in the Prouince of Poictou, which ſurely he would not do to a rebell and traitor. What other crime then hath this Towne committed, to be thus aſſailed and threatned with a ſiege, and forced to expect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her wals the Kings cannon and armie, which maketh towards it with all diligence and ſpeed? What crime alſo may the Towne of Iargeau (another place of ſafetie) haue committed, which was at the ſame time beſieged, other then our enemies oath to haue no mercie? then the hate of our Religion, whoſe ruine they haue conſpired?</p>
            <p>This is that which we lay downe before the eyes of all our Countrymen, and not of them alone, but of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, whom we here appeale vnto to iudge of our inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie, and of the violent perſecution that we vniuſtly ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer. And though this true narration of our enemies procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings againſt vs, and of ours towards our King, witneſſeth ſufficiently the calumnie of their accuſation, by the which they proclaime vs rebels; yet that we may not leaue any ſhadow that might alienate from vs the fauour of good mens equitable iudgements, their compaſſion of our miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and their helpe in our iuſt and neceſſary defence: we can eaſily ſhew that as in vs there is neither appearance nor ſuſpition of the crime of rebellion which they lay vnto our charge. God forbid that any one ſhould thinke that the complaints which violence and oppreſſion doth extort from vs, do any way concerne our King, in whom we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge &amp; reuerence with our hearts the image of God here on earth. But if laying vpon ſuch as abuſe his affections and conſcience, the iniuſtice of the which we complaine, we would name who, and tell what they are that accuſe vs, all France that groanes oppreſſed with the intollerable bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of their tyrannie, would witneſſe for vs that we ſhould not ſpeake it by way of recrimination nor calumnie. But it ſhall ſuffice our innocencie, that we onely purge our ſelues of the accuſation. They accuſe vs of rebellion and diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and ſay that we kicke againſt the Kings authoritie.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:14707:18"/>
Thankes be to God, the Religion that we profeſſe, and which we haue from time to time declared by a ſolemne confeſſion preſented to our Kings in witneſſe of the puritie of our ſeruice to God, and the ſinceritie of our obedience to them, hath long ſince acquitted vs of that imputation. We acknowledge no power on earth aboue our Kings. We ſweare not to any other. We deteſt all doctrine that teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that either directly or indirectly we may be freed from the allegiance we haue ſworne vnto him. The holy profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of theſe principles, hath euer been the ſquare and rule of all our fathers and our actions. When was it found that any of vs did bathe an execrable knife in the blood of our Kings? or ioyne ſwords with the great enemie to ſpill our countries intrailes? Or rather after ſo many wounds as France hath heretofore receiued from him, did not God vſe our fathers armes to raiſe her euen from the graue? And now that the ſame conſpiracie is newly reuiued, that they who haue ſworne mortall hatred to our Religion, and with the like furie haue vowed the ruine and deſtruction of all the Eſtates of Chriſtendome, and particularly of this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie, gouerning at their pleaſure the Kings heart and wil by their ſuggeſtions to his conſcience, do induce him to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard his State to vndo vs: we dare ſay, that time and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience will yet make him acknowledge that he hath not in all his kingdome a ſurer prop for his Crowne then our fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie. And certainly there can be nothing more plaine to all ſuch as looke vpon vs, then that the intereſt of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation is vnſeparably nailed to the peace and tranquilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of this kingdome, and ſtrength of our Prince's authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. It is vndoubtedly true, that according to the humane meanes that God vſeth for the aduancement of his worke, the conſeruation and growth of our Religion in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, do wholy depend on the libertie and ſafetie of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts vnder which we liue; the maintaining of theſe Edicts, on the Kings abſolute authoritie. Witnes the happie reigne of <hi>Henrie</hi> the Great, whom as God had raiſed in abſolute power and authoritie higher then any other of the Kings
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:14707:19"/>
of Chriſtendome, ſo alſo vnder that proſperitie and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of this Monarchie, our Churches were ſeene to flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh and replant themſelues, and the Goſpell to fructifie with ſo great ſucceſſe, that our enemies burſting for ſpight, neuer left till they had perfidiouſly depriued France of this ſo abſolute King. And though now for a pretext to inuade vs and ſtirre vp warre againſt our Religion, they haue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed vs of diſobedience; haue we done any thing elſe then complaine of the infringing of the Kings authoritie and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts, and demand redreſſe? And is there in this any ſhadow of rebellion againſt our Prince? We aſſembled our ſelues to demand iuſtice of him. Had we not need and right to do ſo? We haue already iuſtified it by the eſtate of our cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and the condition of the promiſes made vs. Haue we paſſed the limits of complaint? If being denied, we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten returned, and diuers times endeuoured to lay downe our moſt humble petitions at our Kings feete; alas! who can diſtaſte it, or blame vs, when we behaue our ſelues to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our King. Gods image vpon earth, euen as God him ſelfe hath commanded vs? And becauſe many Deputies out of all the Prouinces, deſirous to carry backe from the Kings bountie and grace the effect of his good will towards vs, continued together; is it not a malignant and iniurious pettifoggerie, that to authorize a deniall of iuſtice, we ſhould be accuſed of ſhadowing the Kings authoritie? And for a ſpeciall preſident for the ſaid deniall, our enemies al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that the Parliament after the preſentation of their bils, breakes vp, and ſtayeth not for an anſwer. But what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion is there betweene vs and a Parliament? All our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands are particular. We demand not that ſuch rules be preſcribed vnto the State, or ſuch new lawes and orders, wherein certainly the Monarchicall authoritie would be diſparaged and quartered if the Parliament ſhould do more then aduice. But all that we demand, is, that our burnt Churches may be repaired; that the exerciſe of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion let and hindered vs, be re-eſtabliſhed; That Townes giuen vs by the King, and taken from vs by violence, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:14707:19"/>
vs; That officers may be admitted; That children ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by force out of their fathers armes be giuen them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine; and the like. Wherein ſhould the Kings authoritie be diſparaged, if he ſhould command out of hand that in euery one of theſe points iuſtice ſhould be done vs? If a priuate man to whom an iniury is done, may iuſtly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of it, and expect iuſtice from the King; why, if the if the iniury be done out of hate to a generalitie, may not a generalitie do the ſame? Can there be then any greater iniuſtice then to accuſe vs of rebellion and diſobedience, becauſe we complained and demanded iuſtice in this ſort? any greater crueltie, then to perſecute vs for this cauſe, and make warre vpon vs? But this is ſufficient to ſhew that the far fetcht pretexts of our enemies are but coloured ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to execute the old deſigne of making warre vpon our Religion, and to plunge France in confuſion and trouble.</p>
            <p>Wherefore conſidering the iuſtice &amp; vrging need we had to haue recourſe by our complaints vnto the Kings prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: The right and permiſſion granted vs to reaſſemble our ſelues to that end in ſuch expreſſe and ſolemne termes: the failing and breach of promiſes, cauſed by the fraud of our enemies. Their violence in hindring our acceſſe vnto our King, and in cauſing all our ſuites to be reiected. The iniuſtice of their accuſation, and the ſlanderous crime of rebellion that they impoſe vpon vs. The diſloyaltie of their proceedings co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered, whiles they temporize vpon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſall of doing vs iuſtice, that they might take from vs three Townes at once in Viuarez, by the fraud of a treatie and breaking their publike faith. The inuaſion of the whole country of Bearn, contrary to ſuch an expreſſe ſtipulation, and ſo fully performed on our ſide: And after that to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſuch bloodie and inhumane acts of hoſtilitie. And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this infamous perfidie conſidered, that vnder the ſhadow of a Declaration authorized with the Kings ſacred name, &amp; confirmed in all the Courts of Parliament of France, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing libertie and ſafetie by maintaining the Edicts vnto all ſuch as ſhould remaine in their obedience; the Towne
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:14707:20"/>
of Saumur was ſeized on, where the gates were opened with ſo much obedience and reſpect vnder expreſſe and particular promiſes (beſides the publicke faith of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration) that nothing ſhould be innouated. That by a like fraud and trecherie the Towne of Iargeau was at the ſame time inuaded, S. Iohn d'Angely aſſaulted, and now is in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of a ſiege. All Proteſtants diſarmed throughout all the chiefe Townes of Normandie, to prepare them, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las! for a more eaſie ſlaughter. If all theſe things, we ſay, be rightly conſidered together, we doubt not but it will eaſily appeare that we ſuffer this perſecution for iuſtice ſake, and by the hatred of our Religion, which a generall conſpiracie throughout all Europe now threatneth to deſtroy.</p>
            <p>Wherefore being forced for the libertie of our conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and out of loue to our Country, to ſeeke in our ſelues, and towards the friends of our Religion and this State, a iuſt and neceſſary defence: we here yet againe preſent our ſelues with teares before our King, beſeeching him in all humilitie to conſider and beleeue, that the vowes and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent deſires that we continually powre forth vnto God in our prayers, are for the proſperitie of his perſon and State. And that it would pleaſe him to remember that our fathers taught by their Religion the true obedience due vnto their King, haue neglected the ſefetie of their owne liues, to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and aduance the labours of <hi>Henrie</hi> the Great, in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couery of his kingdome, perfidiouſly ſold and expoſed to the enemie, by the very ſame pretexts of hatred and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution againſt our Religion and vs. And that he would vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that we following our fathers ſteps, as heires of their affections, haue neuer forſaken the dutie we were borne to, nor refuſed the true obedience and ready ſeruice that our Religion teacheth vs to yeeld him. And would to God, Sir, that your Maieſtie moued with the true intereſt of your greatneſſe, and out of your, naturall generoſitie, would for the ſetling of your Crowne and diginitie of your kingdome, turne your armes vpon the enemies of your State, and vſe our fidelitie in the defence of ſuch a cauſe.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:14707:20"/>
We will boldly ſay for our ſelues, that in ſo glorious an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation betweene your beſt ſubiects, we would cary away the priſe from them all. But we ſay now with teares of blood, and in the bitterneſſe of grones that teare our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trals, that the enemies of your Crowne and perſon, Sir, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing induced you to draw your ſword againſt vs, and to bathe it in the blood of your loyalleſt ſubiects, will vndo both your Crowne and perſon altogether. They are your vndoubted enemies, that kindle your hatred againſt vs, to fire your Eſtate, and burie you in the ruines. Who hauing cruelly murthered the greateſt King of the world, your glorious father, becauſe he would not hate vs, and that his goodneſſe and iuſtice did protect vs as his truſtie ſubiects; do now induce your Maieſtie to hate and deſtroy vs, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerwhelme yourſelfe with the fall of this Monarchie. And if in this tempeſt which they haue already ſtirred vp, and which we feele comming downe vpon vs, we are conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for our owne defence and preſeruation to betake our ſelues vnto naturall remedies, we here proteſt, Sir, before God, before you, and before all men, that our purpoſe is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermore to preſerue your authoritie and the reſpect of your obedience among vs; and that we will do our beſt ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours to ſaue your ſacred perſon and kingdome from pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing. God, who is the God of mercie and reuenge, and who according to the decrees of his counſell, ſometimes hath powred out his wrath with diuers examples of horror on the heads of Kings and nations riſen againſt him. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times hath preſerued and reconciled to himſelfe the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt perſecutors of his Church, grant, according to our vowes, that your Maieſtie ſecure from all dangers, may acknowledge the Religion and fidelitie of thoſe perſons whom you now hate and know not.</p>
            <p>In the meane while we call here by our moſt humble ſupplications all Kings, Princes and Eſtates intereſſed in the innocencie of good and faithfull ſubiects oppreſſed, but eſpecially bound in conſcience before God to defend the cauſe of his truth. And requeſt them to prop with their
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:14707:21"/>
helpe and ſuccour the weake defence that of neceſſitie we oppoſe to the many and puiſſant forces of our enemies, who hauing choſen this time of purpoſe, now that they haue ſet on fire the greateſt part of the Eſtates from whence they imagine we might haue expected ſuccour, hope to oppreſſe vs with greater facilitie. But our chiefeſt truſt is in the arme of the Almightie, who ouerthroweth the deſſignes of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and blaſts the enterpriſes of people conſpiring againſt Iſrael. And ſince that for the glorie of his Name we are ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and that to ouerthrow his truth our ruine is ſought af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, we aſſure our ſelues that he will make vs feele the ſame deliuerance that our fathers haue proued by his ſuccour, which we call vpon from the bottome of our ſoules. <hi>Keepe not thou ſilence, O God; hold not thy peace, and be not ſtill, O God.
