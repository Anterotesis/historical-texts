         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">U</seg>Pon the firſt day of November 1650. (towards evening)
came one <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> (that called himſelf a Warrenner)
one <hi>Iohn Collins</hi> a Glover, one <hi>Wyberton,</hi> and four others
to the houſe of one <hi>Middleton,</hi> at the <hi>David and Harp</hi>
in Moor lane, in the parriſh of <hi>Giles Creplegate, London,</hi>
where ſome of them being known, they were ſoon admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into the beſt room in the houſe, and entertained by the woman of the
houſe, who long before was ſuſpected to be one of the Ranting crue. When
they had continued many hours in the houſe, and it grew ſomething late in
the evening, when the ſtreet was void of noiſes, and ſober men prepared to
go to bed, theſe people were heard to ſing blaſphemous ſongs in the tune of
<hi>Davids</hi> Pſalms, and many uncivil words and actions were perceived and
heard to paſs amongſt them; which put it into the hearts of ſome of the
neighbours to acquaint the Conſtable therewith; who being as deſirous
to ſuppreſs diſorders, as willing to bring ſuch wicked perſons to condign pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
he took ſome others with him to apprehend them; but to make
the fuller diſcovery of this wicked pack, one that had ſome acquaintance
with an active Ranter, went alone to the door where this wicked company
were, and enquired of <hi>Iohn Collins</hi> that opened it, whether ſuch a one were
not amongſt them? who replied, he was not there yet, but was expected;
asking him if he was of his acquaintance? to which the party anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that he was: then <hi>Collins</hi> took him about the neck, and kiſſed him,
ſaying, <hi>Welcome fellow creature.</hi> With this the party came into the room,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:115485:4"/>
where the like ceremony was offered by the reſt (ſome Women being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> amongſt them:) preſently after, one of the men let his breeches ſlip down
in the middle of the room, and another ran and kiſt his buttock, and called
to the reſt to come and kiſſe their <hi>God.</hi> And after the paſſing away of a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
more time in blaſphemous words and uncivil behaviour, a joynt of meat,
and ſome other things were brought and ſet upon the table, about which they
flackt like bruit beaſts, without any order, or ſign of reverence; but on the
contrary; one of them laid hold on the meat, and tearing it to pieces like a
dog, both for himſelf and the reſt of his fellow creatures, in a beaſtly manner
he let a great Fart, and as it gave report he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               </gap> theſe words, <hi>Let every
thing thing that hath breath praiſe the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the middeſt of which prophane and wicked words and behaviour,
came in the Conſtable and apprehended them, who thinking them to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
over to commit all manner of wickedneſſe, thought good to ſearch their
pockets, for fear they might have ſome dangerous weapons about them to
do miſchief, and in ſearching them, he found two written papers ſtuffed
with very blaſphemous matter, which are not fit to be made publick, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
untill ſuch time as they have received their tryall, when this was done
the Conſtable brought them down ſtairs into another room, and himſelf and
others reproved them for their wickedneſſe, in the midſt of which reproof,
one of them, that were taken took a candle and made as though he did ſeek
for ſomething that he had loſt, and being asked what he ſought for, in a
jeering and diſdainfull manner he anſwered, <hi>That he ſought for his ſins but
there were none,</hi> and that which they thought ſo great unto him, was ſo
ſmall, that he could not ſee it, by which it appears that they hold forth an
opinion, that <hi>Sin is no ſin,</hi> for which opinion an Officer of the Army was
lately caſhiered, and his ſword broken over his head, at the head of the
Regiment. But to return to that which I was relating before, the Conſtable
finding them deſperately incorragible and hardened in their iniquity, carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the ſaid <hi>Collins, Shake ſpear,</hi> and five others to the Compter, (who
had been accompanied with Mrs. <hi>Middleton</hi> her ſelf, had ſhe not privately

            <p>The next morning they were brought before Sir <hi>Iohn Wolaſton,</hi> and
charged with the matters before recited; as alſo that they had ſung vile and
filthy ſongs to the tune of Pſalms, and uttered many oaths (or aſſeverati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of oaths) and execrations: ſome of which were, <hi>Ram me, Dam me,</hi>
&amp;c. and it being demanded of one of them what they meant by theſe words,
he ſaid by the word <hi>Ram,</hi> they meant <hi>God:</hi> and many other things of this
nature were confeſſed by them: whereupon Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> ſent them to Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,
where for a time they beat Hemp; and are bound over to anſwer for
their offences, according to Law the next Seſſions.</p>

Having given you the true relation of this meeting, with the manner of
their diſcovery, and ſome paſſages concerning their examinations, I ſhall
proceed to ſome other inſtances to ſhew the vanity of this mad crew (of
which there be too many) for all pleaſures which are not reduced to honeſty
and neceſſity, are reproachfull and evill and eſpecially thoſe two of touching

as all occaſions and opportunities, whereby the people are trained
and drawn away to live diſhoneſtly, ſhameleſſely, wickedly, and intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
are to be ſhunned and avoided, take in the next place ſome perticulers
of another meeting which they had near Thames-ſtreet (not long before the
Act was made againſt blaſphemy, and another act for whoredome, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi>
as ſoon as they came together they coupled men and women) chooſing
their mates, and when they had fitted themſelves in that kind, there comes
into the room a man with a pottle of ſack, and a glaſſe in his hand uttering
theſe words, <hi>viz. Where doth God want any wine,</hi> to which preſently an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
one that had his minion on his knee, <hi>here, here,</hi> at which words the
glaſſe of ſack was given him, and he drank to his fellow creature (as he
called her) and ſo it went round, after this they fell to ſinging filthy ſongs
and catches which are not fit to be publiſhed, yet, for ſatisfaction ſake, I ſhal
give one of their ſongs to the firſt Scene, when they began to act upon the
Devils Stage, what every one pleaſed, according to the fulneſſe of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

A Gent. of quality (as I am credidibly informed) meeting with a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman
of his acquaintance, after a ſalutation how do you, and a little famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar
diſcourſe, he told her he was indifferent well in health, but wanted a ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack,
whereupon ſhe replied that if he pleaſed to come to her lodging the
next day, ſhe doubted not but ſhe ſhould find ſomething to which he had an
appetite, for which courteous invitation, in a civil manner he returned thanks,
and promiſed a viſit the next day about 11 of the clock: at which time accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to appointment he made good his promiſe; and being invited up unto
her chamber, he found her in her night array; and after the firſt greeting was
over, ſhe asked him how he found his ſtomack? he replied, that it was as
when he left her the day before; ſhe then ſaid, that ſhe hoped it would ſoon
be regained: and on the ſudden, inſtead of putting on her day apparel, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robed
her ſelf of what ſhe had on, and appearing in nothing but her
ſmock, asked him how he liked her, and whether his ſtomack would not
come to him? to which he replied, that he underſtood not her meaning;
but he hoped to have a ſtomack to his victuals when it was before him: then
ſhe ſaid, <hi>I will try that preſently;</hi> and immediately preſented her ſelf to
him naked, ſaying, Fellow Creature, what ſayeſt thou to a plump leg of
mutton (ſtriking her hand upon her thigh) with the cates that are now in
thy view? which ſtrange carriage of hers, did ſo appal this vertuous Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
that he (in bluſhing wiſe) departed, wondring at the ſhameleſſe
uncivil carriage of her, of whom he had better confidence; which may
be read and commended for a badge of his Vertue and Chaſtitie, and
characterize the deſerved infamy of the laſcivious behaviour of her that was
empty of all goodneſſe, and diſcover her to be a true Proſolite of <hi>Cop</hi> and
<hi>Claxton</hi> and the reſt of that infernal gang which have been the diſpercers of a
Diabolicall opinion that there is neither heaven nor hell, for otherwiſe ſhe
could not be ſo audacious.</p>
            <p>Having named <hi>Cop,</hi> I cannot let it paſſe without a word or two of
what he is; he is one that not long, ſince aſſumed the Pulpit in a noted
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115485:6"/>
Church in London, and in a moſt wicked manner blaſphemed and curſt, for
an hour together ſaying, a pox of God take al your prayers hearing, reading,
faſting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And being charged before he came down with uttering blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy,
he ſaid that he would anſwer what he had done, and for this and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things of like nature laid to his charge, he is now in Newgate, and to
diſcover what might be ſaid of him alone, would fill many ſheets of paper,
at this time I have promiſed brevity; therefore I ſhall onely ad to that in the
pulpit. a paſſage of his on an ale-houſe bench, which is this, when he had
drunk very hard and the woman of the houſe, to avoid diſorder, deſired him
and his company to depart the houſe, he ſaid <hi>God Dam me,</hi> thou needſt not
fear, <hi>The Divel confound me,</hi> thou art in heaven, <hi>By Gods Bloud and
Wounds,</hi> thou art ſav'd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which put the woman into ſuch a fright, to hear
his curſes and blaſphemies, that ſhe trembled and quaked ſome hours
after.</p>
            <p>I thought to have given you many other particulers, but I hope theſe are
ſufficient to ſatisfie all good people concerning the wicked practiſes and
blaſphemous opinions of this generation which have too long increaſed, and
from what hath been ſaid by way of diſcovery, take warning and avoid their
company which may prove dangerous to the body as well as to the ſoul: for
I am able to juſtifie that one <hi>Evan ap Bevan</hi> born of good Parentage near
Biſhops-Caſtle in the County of Salop, was for many years a conſtant
hearer of the word, yet afterwards fell into ſtrange opinions &amp; would admit
of no Scrament, no Baptiſm, no Duty, no Obedience, no Divell, no Hell,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> in a ſhort time after his fall into theſe grand errours (the Divel grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſtrong with him) that for no other cauſe but that they were conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and finding an opportunity, he cut off the heads of his own mother and
brother, for which he was hanged in chains near Shrews-bury.</p>
