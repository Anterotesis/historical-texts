            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou are now presented with my
larger Survey of <hi>Kent</hi> (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
in my Epistle to my
late brief Survey of the same)
wherein (among severall
things) (I hope conducible
to the service of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty)
you will finde mention
of some memorable acts done, and offices of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
<pb facs="tcp:61838:3"/>
trust borne, by severall of your Ancestors,
other remarkeable matters touching them, and
the Places of Habitation, and Interment of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them. For the ready finding whereof, I
have added an Alphabeticall Table at the end of
this Tract. My Obligation of Gratitude to that
County (wherein I have had a comfortable sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence
for above Thirty five years last past,
and for some of them had the Honour to serve
the same) pressed me to this Taske (which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
finished) If it (in any sort) prove servicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
thereunto, I have what I aimed at; My
humble request is; That if herein any thing
be found (either by omission or alteration)
substantially or otherwise different from my a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid
former Survey, you would be pleased
to be informed, that the same happened by
reason of further or better information (tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to more certaine truths) than formerly I had.
Those differencies, and the rectifying of the
same, are contained in a parcell of this Tract
(towards the end thereof) which I now added;
That thereby Correction may be made of my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Survey, which will be more conveniently
portable (for ordinary use) than this. What
is found defective herein, be pleased not to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
to wilfull errour; But either to misappre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension,
or misinformation (both which I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to avoid) And as to the distances of
Parishes (herein specified) be pleased to know
<pb facs="tcp:61838:3"/>
that I meane the same by a straight line from
Church to Church, taking the Station for the
view at <hi>Newenden,</hi> being the middle of the
South-side of the County, as they stand in
that best Map thereof extant, made by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<hi>Phillip Symonson</hi> (sometime Resident there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in)
which I the rather doubt not to call the best
for that (by comparing the same with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers)
I finde it so to be; and the like Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
(in effect) was long since set upon the
same, by that Learned, Judicious and Laborious
Gentleman, <hi>William Lambard,</hi> Esquire, whose
Monument of Piety and Charity, in this County
Directory to the peaceable Government of
the same, and painfull and able performance of
his <hi>Perambulation</hi> thereof, have rendred and will
perpetuate his Memory Famous. The last
whereof hath left very little matter of addition
(but much of imitation) both for my self, and all
others that shall succeed him in works of this
nature, which was the principall cause that I
endeavoured brevity herein, being unwilling
too far to lengthen this Tract with repetition of
what hath been better set forth by others,
though in works of this nature all ingenuous
persons know, much use must be made of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
of our Predecessors. (There being no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way to enable treating of matters long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our being) Now that the Errata's of the
Presse may first be corrected by what is at the end
<pb facs="tcp:61838:4"/>
of this Tract (for that purpose) prepared, before
the Tract be read, and that (in reading the same)
other smaller errours of the Presse may also be
corrected, and that the passages herein may be
well weighed, before censured, and the veile of
love cast over what is (either in truth or in the
Readers conceit) defective, or mistaken, is the
humble desire of.</p>

not generally so healthy as the most part of the rest of the

            <p>The commodious scituation of this County may justly

            <p>How far this County is otherwise equall to (if not
excelling) any other County of this Nation, I shall offer
to the Readers judgement these considerations.</p>
            <p>First, Concerning Religion, I know that <hi>Glastenbury</hi>
in the County of <hi>Somerset</hi> doth pretend (and not pretend
only) that about the 31<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. year after the death of Christ,
12. of the Disciples of the Apostle <hi>Philip</hi> (of which <hi>Ioseph</hi>
of <hi>Arimathea</hi> was cheif) came into this Nation, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
the knowledge of Christian Religion to <hi>Arviragus</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:61838:7"/>
then King thereof) (which though he consented not to
embrace) yet he permitted them to have a Church at this
<hi>Glastenbury,</hi> and there began the plantation of Christian
Religion in this land (which being admitted) yet it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
appeareth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That (for many years) the same had but
little successe of en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ale and no King of this Nation em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
the same, till King <hi>Lucius</hi> (who raigned about
150. years afterwards, and built a Church in <hi>Dover Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle</hi>
in this County, for the exercise of Christian Religion,
from whence may be inferred, that that Religion was
the embraced here, But most part of the Nation revolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>om that Religion, and becoming Pagans till the
year 596. (In the time of the <hi>Heptarchy) Augustine</hi> the
Monk was sent from Pope <hi>Gregory,</hi> to convert this Na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ion
to the Christian faith, and first landed in this County, and
converted and baptised many of the people of the same,
and likewise converted <hi>Ethelbert,</hi> (then King thereof)
who upon <hi>Whitsunday</hi> in the year 597. was by him here
baptised, was the first Christian <hi>Saxon</hi> King, and this
County was the first County that generally received the
Christian faith; afterwards <hi>Edwin</hi> (King of the <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi>
Marrying from hence <hi>Edelburg</hi> (Daughter of the said
King <hi>Ethelbert) Paulinus</hi> (afterwards Bishop of <hi>Rochester</hi>)
went from hence with her into her husbands Kingdome
(for the conversion of the people thereof) where in some
part he prevailed, but in the year 633. (<hi>Edwin</hi> being slain)
that people revolted from that Religion, and <hi>Paulinus</hi>
was forced to returne again hither, and Christian Religion
was again (as it were) confined to this County, Nor were
succession of Christian Bishops in this Nation (other than
of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>Rochester</hi> (both in this County) for
many years afterwards, and instrumentally from thence
sprang the after-conversion of the rest of the Nation to the
Christian faith; But the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>version of the West <hi>Saxons</hi> (with
in whose Dominion <hi>Glastenbury</hi> was) was not till about
40. years after the conversion of this County (At which
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61838:7"/>
time <hi>Kingils</hi> their King was converted and baptised by
<hi>Byrinus</hi> an <hi>Italian</hi> Bishop.</p>
            <p>This County (as before appeareth) had in it two
Bishops Seas (one whereof, <hi>viz. Canterbury,</hi> was the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
and Metropolitan of all <hi>England:</hi> And his Church
very anciently called the Nurse and Metropolis of
the same) By which, and by what is hereafter said, may
be collected th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t the rise of that common proverbe <hi>(Kent
and Christendome)</hi> was not (as vulgarly mistaken) that
<hi>Kent</hi> was conceived diffinct from Christendome, but that
it was famous as <hi>Kent,</hi> and famous as Christendome.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Concerning the ancient dignity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderableness
of this County: In the time of <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi>
(about 1700. years since) it was in Four petty King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
governed by Four Kings (viz. <hi>Cingetorix, Cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,
Taximagulus,</hi> and <hi>Segonax.</hi>)</p>
            <p>Afterwards King <hi>Vortigern</hi> (about 1200. years since)
set over the same a Guorong or Vice-Roy.</p>
            <p>Afterwards, this was the first of the Kingdomes of the
Heptarchy, and no one County of <hi>England</hi> had a King of
it self but this (whose Kingdome began about the year
455. and continued about 372. years, in the succession
of 17. Kings.)</p>
            <p>By that learned Antiquary Mr. <hi>Camden,</hi> it is called the
key of <hi>England,</hi> and in it is Four of the Cinque portes of
this Nation (viz. <hi>Sandwich, Dover, New Romney,</hi> and
<hi>Hith</hi>) as also that famous Castle of <hi>Dover,</hi> the confide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rableness
whereof <hi>Phillip</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> well weighing,
when (in the time of King <hi>Hen. 3.) Lewes</hi> his son, had
took divers townes and fortes in <hi>England,</hi> and hearing
that he could not take this Castle (the same being vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly
defended by <hi>Hubert de Burgh</hi>) protested that then
his son had not one foot of land in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, The civility of the people (still treading
in the steps of their Ancestors) who in the time of the
aforesaid <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> were by him accounted, and so
stiled, the most civilized people of all this Nation:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:61838:8"/>Fourthly, For the ancient valour of the people of this
County, they claime, and are allowed the front in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes.
And they onely of all <hi>England</hi> obteyned and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne
the name of <hi>VNCONQVERED:</hi> For (as if
all the antient English valour were remaining in them)
they only resisted King <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour, (when
all other Counties submitted) and (capl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ulating with
him) reserved to themselves and their posterity, their anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Customes and Liberties.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Which is the next confideration offered, <hi>viz.</hi>
Generally the tenures of the lands in this County, are (if
not the freest) yet as free tenures as any in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixthly, The royal Navy usually riding in the <hi>Downes</hi>
of this County, in which County also are those three fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Shipdocks of <hi>Deptford, Woolwich,</hi> and <hi>Chetham;</hi> in
the two first whereof, the principall part of the Royall
Navy is usually repaired, and in the last, the same is usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
also repaired, and laid up.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, Four houses lately belonging to the Kings
of <hi>England,</hi> viz. <hi>East Greenwich, Eltham, Otford,</hi> and
<hi>Dartford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Eighthly, The severall good commodities for the use
of man, with which it is richly furnished and famous for,
<hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Plenty of Fowl and Fish of all sorts (by advantage
of the aforesaid Seas and fresh Rivers.)</p>
            <p>2. Fertil lands, for feeding cattle of all sorts (and
more especially those famous levels of <hi>Romney,</hi> and <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
Marsh.)</p>
            <p>3. The Drapery of this County, which hath here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
for above three hundred and twenty years; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
which the bowels of this County are well stored
with Fullers earth, and many fulling mills not far distant
from the same.</p>
            <p>4. The Fruit (plentifully sent from hence to the
chief City, <hi>London,</hi> and places adjacent.)</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:61838:8"/>5. The great plenty of grain (of all sorts) growing
therein, and more especially in the North, and East parts
of the same.</p>
            <p>6. The Plenty of wood, but more especially in the
Weald, wherein also are many Iron mills, floring with
Iron <hi>London,</hi> and the other places adjacent</p>
            <p>Some Chronologers affirm that King <hi>Alfred</hi> divided
this Nation (and among the rest this part thereof) into
Shires, Counties, or Provinces; but that is controverted
by others, and alledged that it was so divided short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after the inhabiting of this Island, and in the tra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

               <p>And first touching that which is of most dignity (the

of <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi>) built according to the <hi>Romane</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

was called <hi>Caesars</hi> Castle, and the <hi>Romans</hi> Court, and so
continued for about 80. years; at which time (the same
being in decay) <hi>Arviragus</hi> (King of <hi>Britain</hi>) having posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
it, reedified &amp; inlarged the same, &amp; fortified it against
the Romanes (calling it <hi>Ledonnegio</hi>) and he stopped the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient

called <hi>De à Fore,</hi> or stopt before, or stop out;

name (among the <hi>Britains</hi>) for all Waters (touching
which, I leave the Reader to his election.)</p>
               <p>This Castle after falling to decay, was repaired by
<hi>Withred</hi> King of <hi>Kent</hi> (about 950. years since) and at the
coming in of King <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour was (on the
behalf of King <hi>Harold</hi>) kept against him by <hi>Stephen Ash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borneham</hi>
(a Baron) and <hi>Alan</hi> of <hi>Evering</hi> his Lieurenant,
but (the same being taken by the Conquerour) they
were both beheaded, and afterwards that King made
<hi>Iohn</hi> Lord <hi>Fynes</hi> (his kinsman) Constable thereof by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:61838:45"/>
gave him very many Knights fees, for his bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
mainteyning of the same, and the said Constable af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
made the work on the hanger of the hill there,
and also made eight chief Captains or Lieutenant Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
of this Castle whose names do follow) and to
them such Knights fees were assigned, and for the same
they warded in this Castle yearly as followeth, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Albrance,</hi> otherwise <hi>Albrank</hi> had one and
twenty Knights fees, and warded twenty eight weeks.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Arsick</hi> had eighteen Knights fees, and
warded twenty four weeks.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Fulbert</hi> of <hi>Dovor</hi> had fifteen Knights fees, and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
twenty weeks.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Iefferey Peverell</hi> had fourteen Knights fees, and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
twenty weeks.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>William Mamouth</hi> had twenty foure Knights fees,
and warded thirty two weeks.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Robert Porth</hi> had twelve Knights fees, and warded
twenty four weeks.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Hugh Crevequer</hi> had five Knights fees, and warded
twenty foure weeks.</p>
               <p>And Sir <hi>Adam Fitzwilllams</hi> had six Knights fees, and
warded twenty four weeks.</p>
               <p>And by this means there were alwayes 1000. men in
the same for the Guard thereof (which Guard was so kept
for fear of the <hi>Danes,</hi> and by reason of the distrust which
that King had of the men of this County) and these Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
built and repaired their severall Towers in this
Castle.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Iohn</hi> afterwards recompenced the heire of <hi>Fynes</hi>
for the same, and took it into his hands, and afterwards
(in the time of King <hi>Hen.</hi> 3.) this personall service of
Castle-guard was turned into a contributory payment of
money (towards guarding the Castle) and sworne War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
were appointed for that service, and in those dayes
there belonged to the same many Souldiers (both Horse
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:61838:45"/>
and foot) and therefore the Arches, Vaults, and Barbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans
were made there for them to issue out at.</p>

               <p>This Parish is very populous, and one of the greatest
Parishes in the County (not having a Town therein) and
it so appeared to be, for that antiently upon Collection
of the number of Communicants in every parish in the
County (onely foure Parishes in the same) <hi>viz. Maidstone
Cranbrooke, Feversham,</hi> and <hi>Goudherst</hi> (all which have
Townes in them) were found to have more Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants

20. years last past) at the least, 1400. Communicants,
but it hath very many poor therein (the charge where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
in the year, 1653. was 209l. 9s. 3d. whereas in the

               <p>The Abbot of <hi>Battel</hi> was Patron of the Church, and

the mariage of <hi>Thomas Scot</hi> with <hi>Mildred</hi> (daughter and

the house is still there extant.</p>
               <p>In this Chappell also (in the North Windowes of the

wives kneeling. <hi>viz.</hi> three at the bottom of each of the

               <p>These windowes having been broken, and more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially

reported to be owners of the twelve Denns, which are
held of <hi>Wye,</hi> but that cannot be, for that onely seven
of the said twelve, are in this Parish, and it is (as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said)
yet discernable, That three of them were <hi>Ockley,
Cockshot</hi> and <hi>Badcock,</hi> none of which were of the said
twelve Denns (though very antient inhabitants in this

inhabitants in this Parish, at the time of the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

               <p>In the great Window of the middle Chancell, were

               <p>In this Parish is part of a Castle (<hi>viz.</hi> the Outmost gates,
and the old Mill.) But the rest of the same is in <hi>Bromfield:</hi>
Touching the foundation of which Castle, I finde, That
one <hi>Ledian</hi> (a chief Councellour of King <hi>Ethelbert</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond)
about 800. years since, raised there a Pile or Fort
for his safety (which was afterwards wasted by the <hi>Danes</hi>)
and so continued till the time of King <hi>William</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour;
and then Sir <hi>Hugh Crevequer</hi> (a <hi>Norman</hi> Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and one of the eight chief Captains or Lievtenant
Govenours of <hi>Dovor</hi> Castle) having that place allotted to
him (about the year 1071.) began the building thereof
the Castle, and called it, by the old name, <hi>Leeds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the Northwest part thereof, he built a Chappel; in
which he put three Channons, which afterwards were
(by Sr. <hi>Robert Crevenquer</hi> his son) removed into the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory
in this Parish: And <hi>Adam Crevequer</hi> (son of the said
Sir <hi>Robert</hi>) finished that Castle (which flourished till the
time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the second) who took the same from
<hi>Bartholomew</hi> Lord <hi>Badlesmer</hi> (to whom he had formerly
given it, in exchange for other lands) which taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
thus happened. In the year 1321. about <hi>Michaelmas,</hi>
Queen <hi>Isabell</hi> (wife of King <hi>Edw.</hi> 2.) in her journey in
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:61838:87"/>
this County, personally desired lodging in this Castle;
but in the absence of the Lord <hi>Badlesmer,</hi> Owner thereof;
then being in Arms for the Barons against that King, she
was, by the then present Governour) denyed entrance,
at which that King, hearing thereof, was incensed, and
laying siege thereunto (about the end of <hi>October</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
took it: And therein <hi>Thomas Culpeper</hi> (the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour)
whom he hanged, with five more of the chief per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
which he found therein; and the Lord <hi>Badlesmers</hi>
Wife and Children he sent to the Tower, and seized
his Estate; and it continued in the Crown till the time
of King <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. (at which time it being run to ruine) S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.
<hi>Henry Guldeford,</hi> at that Kings charge, reedified the same;
and it came afterwards to be the possession of St. <hi>Leger</hi>
(by grant from the Crown) in the year, 1417. Queene
Dowager <hi>Ioane</hi> (second wife of King <hi>Hen</hi> 4. was (upon
a charge of Treason) committed to this Castle; And
King <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. (after resignation of his Crown) was first
committed hither, before he was sent to <hi>Pomfret.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Priory was built and endowed in this Parish by the
aforesaid Sir <hi>Robert Crevequer,</hi> and <hi>Adam</hi> his son, about
550. years since, who dedicated the same to the honour
of our Saviour and St. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> and placed therein black
<hi>Channons</hi> regular, of the Order of St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> (which
at the suppression was valued at 362l. 7s. 7d. <hi>per annum.</hi>

               <p>The East division doth abut to the German Ocean
