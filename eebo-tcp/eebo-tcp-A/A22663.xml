            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:19452:5"/>
that you writ to me euen by the

the ſame queſtion; both requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me to deliuer my reſponſiue opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
&amp; yet not being ſilent your ſelfe
in deliuering your owne dictamen: for
you ſay the motions of thoſe religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
&amp; faithfull minds which procure
theſe matters, ſieme to you not to be
vaine: &amp; you adde that it canot
be voide of cauſe that the vniuerſal
Church accuſtomes to praye for the
deceaſed, in ſo much that hence it may
alſo be coniectured that it profites one
after his deth, if for the interment of
his bodie ſuch a place is prouided by
the faith of his frends in which euen
this manner of procured aſsiſtance of
Saints may appiere. But althou' this
be thus, yet you ſignifie you know
not ſufficiently how that ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce o'the
Apoſtle is not contrarie to this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<hi>We shall all ſtand at Chriſts Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
that euerie one may receiue according
to that which he performed in his bodie,
be it goud, or euill.</hi> For ſurely this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical
ſentence admoniſhes vs, that
muſt be performed afore deth, which
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:19452:5"/>
may profit vs after our deceaſe: not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euerie one is to receue according
to that which he did afore his deth.</p>
            <p>But this queſtion is thus reſolued
viz. that it is acquired by a certeine
manner of life during the time we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
in this bodie, that theiſe things
may ſom'at helpe the deceaſed, and
that by this meanes, they ar ſuccor'd
according to thoſe matters which they
performed by their bodies, by thoſe
things which are religiouſly perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
for them after their bodies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe.<note place="margin">Marke me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ackow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged in this: &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places by Saint Auſtin: yet reiected, &amp; renounced by preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers.</note>
For this cauſe it is that theſe
matters auaile not thoſe who ether
haue ſo ill merited that they deſerue
not to be ſuccor'd by them, or els
who haue merited ſo well that they
niede not ſuch ſuccors. Whence it is
concluded that it is the manner of
life which one has exerciſed by his
bodie, which is the cauſe why theiſe
matters profite, or profite not him for
whome they are performed after he
has left his bodie. For if no me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
is acquired in this life by which
theſe matters may profite one, it is in
vaine to procure it after this life. Thus
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:19452:6"/>
it is effected that nether the Church nor
the care of ones owne frends exhibites
in vaine what Religious acts they ar
able to performe for the deceaſed, &amp;
yet is it true that euerie one ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceue
according to that he performed
by his bodie, be it goud or be it euill,
our Lord rendring to euerie one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his operations. For it is
acquired in this life which he led in his
bodie, that, that which is exhibited
may profite him after the deth of his
bodie. Now this my briefe reſponſion
might ſufficiently fatisfie your demand,
yet in regarde I haue other motiues

            <p>Whence it was that in my firſt bouke
o' the Citie of God, I ſpake that
which, as I ſuppoſe, is ſufficient to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:19452:7"/>
ſtop their mouthes, who imputing to
Chriſtian times that barbarous ruine
eſpecially which <hi>Rome</hi> ſuffered, obiecte
that vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that Chriſt did not thier
ſuccore his owne people: who, when it
is anſerd them that, the ſoules of thoſe
his fidelious people were receued by
him according to the merits o' their
Faith, then they inſulte about their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſepulcherd
bodies. For this cauſe I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated
this whole place of Scripture
in ſuch termes as thieſe. For nether
indiede could they poſsible be buried
in ſuch a great ruine of Carcaſſes, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
does a pious man imbracing the
predicted ſentence of our Sauiour,
much feare this; nor that beaſtes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring
them ſhall hurte thoſe bodies
which ar to be reſuſcitated, an of which
one heire o' theirs ſhal not periſhe. For
veritie would in no ſorte haue ſaid,
<hi>feare not thoſe who kille the bodie, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
kille the ſoule,</hi> if anie of that which
an enemie would doe to the bodies of
the Saints, did anie way preiudice the
future life. Except peraduenture ſome
one is ſo abſurd as to contend that we
muſt not feare afore our deth thoſe
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:19452:7"/>
who kille the bodie leaſt they kille it:
&amp; yet that we muſt feare after deth leaſt
they ſhould ſuffer it to be buried when
it is a' redie killed. <hi>Ergo,</hi> that would be
falſe which Chriſt ſayes. <hi>Who kille the
bodie, &amp; afterwards haue no more to doe,</hi>
if they haue ſo much to doe about bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies:
God defend that ſhould be falſe,
which veritie pronounced. It is ſaid
that they doe ſom' at when they kille
the bodie, in regard there is ſenſe in a
bodie which is to be killed, but that
afterwards they haue no more to doe,
cauſe there is no ſence in a bodie killed.
wherefore manie bodies of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
haue not bin couerd with erth, but
none euer ſeparated anie o' them from
both Heuen and erth, which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhes
totally with his preſence
who knowes whence he is to reſuſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
that he created. It is indiede ſaid
in the 78. Pſalme, <hi>They expoſed the
bodies o'thy ſeruants for meite to the
birds o' the ayre, the flesh o' thy Saints
to the beaſts o'the erth: they effuſed
their blud like water round about Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,
&amp; there was none who would
burie them.</hi> Yet this was vtterd to am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifie
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:19452:8"/>
the crueltie o'thoſe who did
thieſe things, &amp; not to declare anie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felicitie
in thoſe who ſufferd them. For
althou' thieſe matters ſieme cruel, &amp;
horrible in the viewe of men,<note place="margin">Pſal. 115.</note> yet <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
is the deth of his Saints in the viewe
of our Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For this cauſe all thieſe particulars,
that is the prouiſion of a funeral, the
qualitie o'the ſepulture, the pompe of
Exequies, ar rather comforts for the
liuing, than helpes for the ded. If a
pretious ſepulture profites the impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
a poure one, or none will preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
the pious.<note place="margin">An argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in a contrarie abſurditie.</note> Agreat companie of
ſeruants made a ſumptuous funeral for
the purpled rich one in the viewe of
men, but the Miniſterie of Angels
made the vlcerous poure one much
more ſumptuous exequies in the
viewe of our Lord, who did not
exalte him to a marble tumbe, but
carried him into Abrahams boſome:
They againſt whome I interpriſed
the defenſe o'the Citie of God, laffe

when they died for their tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Countries, nether cared where af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
their bodies were to lye, or

the Poets had licence to ſay plauſible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
touching this matter. <hi>Heuen couers

               <note place="margin">Lacan.</note> How much leſſe
ought they to inſulte ouer Chriſtians
touching their inſepulchred bodies to
whome the reformation o'their fleſh

is promiſed to be reſtored &amp; redinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grated,
not only out o'the erth, but

thoſe of iuſt, &amp; faithfull people, which
the Holie Goſt has vſed as inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts &amp;
veſſels for all goud works. For if the

            <p>Whence it is that the funerals o'the

with officious pietie, their exequies

himſelfe being to reſuſcitate the third

for that ſhe effuſed a pretious

Authorities admoniſhe vs not that
there is anie ſence or fieling in Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſes,

bodies of the ded perteine to Gods
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:19452:9"/>
prouidence (whome ſuch offices of
pitie pleaſes) for confirmation o'the
faith o'the Reſurrection. Whence it
is alſo profitablely lerned how great a
rewarde thiere may befor the almeſſes
which we exhibite to thoſe who liue
and ar ſenſible, if nether this office,
&amp; diligence periſhes with God, which
is performed for the examinated mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of people.</p>
            <p>Thiere are indeed alſo other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
which vtterd by prophetical Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
the holie Patrlarches would haue
vnderſtanded touching ether the bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sferring their bodies: but this
is no place to treate o' them, ſince that
which we haue deliuered ſuffices. But
if thoſe things which are neceſſarie to
the ſuſtenance o'the liuing, as ar victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
&amp; apparell, althou' they be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
with great difficultie, yet they
violate not virtue in goud people, nor
extirpate pietie out o'the mynde, but
reuiue it, &amp; make it more abundant,
how much leſſe doe thoſe matters
which vſe to be exhibited for perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of the funerals, &amp; burials of
the bodies of the deceaſed, when
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:19452:10"/>
they are wanting, make thoſe miſera-ble
whoe are a'redie quietly placed in
the ſecret ſeates o'the pious.</p>
            <p>And according to this whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thieſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
wiere wanting to Chriſtian Corps
in the vaſtatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ether o'that great Citie,
or elſe of other Townes, it is nether the
faulte o'the liuing which could not
exhibite them, nor anie paine to the ded
which could not be ſenſible o'them.
This is my opinion touching de cauſe
&amp; reaſon of Sepulture, which I thiere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
transferd into this bouke out of
an other of my owne, in regarde it was
more eaſie for me to repeate this, than
to deliuer it in an other manner.</p>
            <p>Which if it be true, ſurely alſo the
prouiſion of place for the buriall of
bodies at the monuments of Saints, is
apart of goud humane affection tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards
the funerals of ones owne frends.
For if it is ſome ſort of religion to burie
them, it canot be noe religion to haue
a care whiere they be buried. Yet when
ſuch comforts o'the liuing are required
by which the pious affection o'their
frends towards, them may appiere, I
perceiue not what helpes they be for
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:19452:10"/>
the ded, ſaue onely that whyle they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
where the bodies o'thoſe they
affect,<note place="margin">Note praver to Saints for the ſoules of the decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</note> are placed, they may recommend
them by praier, to the ſame Saints as
to Patrones, whom they haue receued
to aſsiſte with our Lords which in
diede they may performe althou' they
could not interre them in ſuch places.
But nether be thoſe places which
being adorned ar made the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
o'the ded, called <hi>Memories,</hi> or
monuments for anie other reaſon than
bycauſe they by way of admonition re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newe
the memorie, &amp; cogitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> o'thoſe
whoe are ſubſtracted by deth from the
eyes o'the liuing, leaſt they be ſubſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
alſo from the harts of people by
obliuion. For eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the name of <hi>Memorie,</hi>
moſt plainely declares the ſame, &amp; is
called a Monument for that it moues
the mynd, that is in regarde it admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes
vs. For which cauſe the <hi>Grecians</hi>
alſo call it <hi>Mnymeion,</hi> which wie calle a
memorie, or a monument, cauſe the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie
it ſelfe by which we remember,
in their language is called <hi>mnymy.</hi>
When therefore the mynde remembers
whiere the bodie of ones deare frend
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:19452:11"/>
is buried, &amp; the place occurres which
is venerable for the name o'the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr,
the affection o'the rememberer,<note place="margin">Obſerue praver to Saints for the decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</note> &amp;
praier recomends the ſoule it loued, to
the ſame Martyr: which affection
when it is exhibited by their faithfull
and moſt deare frends to diceaſed peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
they themſelues merited that it
ſhould profitte them. But if anie neceſ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ſitie
giues noe leaue, or permits not,
bodies either to be interred at all, or
not be interred in ſuch places, as thoſe,<note place="margin">Note the publique praier o'the Church for the ded, befides the deuotions of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſons.</note>
yet thoſe prayers for the ſoules of the
ded ar not to be pretermitted, which
the Church has ingaged her ſelf to
performe vnder a general commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
for all that are ded in Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
&amp; Catholique Communion, euen
without particular mention o'their
names, to the end that thoſe praiers
may be exhibited to thoſe, by one
pious common mother; who ar ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected
touching thieſe matters, by
their parents, Children, Couzens, or
frends. Yet if theſe ſupplications
were wanting which are performed in
a right faith, &amp; pietie, for the ded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:19452:11"/>
not in anie ſorte auayle their ſoules in
how holle place ſoeuer their examma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
bodies were putte.</p>
            <p>Wherfore when, the faithfull mother
deſired to haue the bodie of her faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
child putte in the Church of a
Martyr, for her to haue had this faith,
was a kynde of prayer, ſince that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed

this was that which profited, if profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table

For it does not improfitably concerne

them, &amp; he could innumerable wayes
haue terrified the crueltie of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
ſo that they ſhould not haue dared
ether to deſtroye thier bodies by fyer,
or diſperſe their aſhes. But nether was
this triall to be awanting to the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
multiplicite o'their temptations,
leaſt their fortitude in Chriſts Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion
whcih was not to yield to the
barbarous rigor of the perſecution,
for the ſafetie of their bodies, ſhould
tremble for the honor of a ſepulcher,
&amp; finally leaſt faith o'the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſhould feare the deſtruction of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
bodies. Thieſe matters theirefore
wiere alſo to be permitted to the intent
that after thieſe ſo great examples of
honour, feruent Martyrs in Chriſts
Confeſsion, might alſo be witneſſes of
that veritie according to which they
lerned that, thoſe who killed their
bodies, had afterwards no more to
doe with them, in regarde that what
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:19452:16"/>
euer they ſhould doe to their defunct
bodies, doubtleſſe they ſhould effect
nothing, ſince that in inſensible fleſh
nether hie who thence departed, could
fiele, nor hie who created it could
loaſe anie thing. But althou' among
thieſe matters which paſſed touching
the bodies o'thoſe who wiere killed,
the Martyrs not fearing them ſufferd
with great fortitude, neuertheleſſe
their Chriſtian brothers wiere much
grieued for that they had no meanes
ether to performe their duties, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the funerall o'the Saints, nor yet
did the ſtraite vigilancie of the cruell
kiepers permitte them to ſubtracte
anie part of them, ſecretly, as the ſame
Hiſtorie teſtifies. So that when no mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie
did touche thoſe who were killed,
ether in the tearing a pieces the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of their bodies, in the combuſtion
o'their bones, or in the diſperſion of
their aſhes, yet thieſe who could not
burie anie part of them, were miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
afflicted, ſince that they in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine
manner felt that of which the
Martyrs wiere in noe ſorte ſenſible, &amp;
whereas no ſuffering was in thieſe, yet
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:19452:16"/>
in the other there was a moſt miſerable
compaſsion.</p>
            <p>According to this which I called a
miſerable compaſsion they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended,
&amp; praiſed by K. <hi>Dauid,</hi> who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
the mercie of Sepulture to the
drye bones of <hi>Saul</hi> &amp; <hi>Ionathas;</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Reg. 22</note> yet what
mercie is afforded to thoſe who ar not
ſenſible? Is this peraduenture to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to that opinion, that inſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherd
people cannot paſſe the infernal
riuer? Let this be farre from Chriſtian
faith, otherwiſe ſuch a great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of Martyrs whoſe bodies could
not be buried, were in a miſerable caſe;
&amp; veritie fallaciouſly pronunced. <hi>Feare
not thoſe who kille the bodie, and haue no
more to doe,</hi> if they could ſo much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice
them as to impedite their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
to their deſired places. But bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
this without all doubt, is moſt
falſe, nether does ſepulture denied,
to their bodies indomage faithfull
people, nor profitte Infidells if they
haue it? Why therefore are thoſe
who buried <hi>Saul</hi> and his Sonne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
for this by the pious King,
ſaue onely for that the hearts of the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:19452:17"/>
               <hi>commiſerators,</hi> ar well affected when
they grieue at that which happens to
the ded bodies of others, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that affect by which none
euer hated his owne fleſh, they will
not haue done after their deth to their
owne bodies: &amp; precure whyle they
remaine ſenſible, to haue that exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
to others who be not ſenſible,
which they will haue exhibited to
them ſelues when they ar not to be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</p>
            <p>Certaine viſions ar recounted which
ſieme to cauſe no irregardeable queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in this diſputation. For ſome ded peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
ar related to haue appiered to the
liuing ether in their ſliepe, or in ſome
other manner, &amp; ſhewing the places in
which their bodies laye vnburied, to
thoſe whoe were ignorant of it, &amp; to
haue admoniſhed them to exhibit the
Sepulture to them which they wanted.</p>
            <p>If we replye that theſe things ar
falſe, wee ſhall ſieme impudently to
contradicte both the writings of ſome
Chriſtians, and alſo the dictamen
of thoſe who affirme they happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
vnto them: but it is to be reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponded
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:19452:17"/>
or anſerd that, we muſt not
imagine the ded ar ſenſible of theſe
matters for that they ſieme to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
ether to ſignifye, or demaunde
them in their ſliepe. For euen the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
appiere often tymes to the liuing
being a ſliepe, when they knowe them
ſelues that they appeare, &amp; they heare
them relate theſe particulers which
they dreamed, &amp; affirming that they
had them, in their ſliepe doing, or
ſpeaking ſom'at. If therefore one can
ſie mee in his ſliepe declaring ſom'at
which is ether aredie effected, or els
prenuntiating ſome future matter
whyle I am totally ignorant of it, nor
yet care not a iot, not only what he
dreames but nether whether he be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake
whyle I ſliepe, or sliepe whyle I
wake, or whether we ſliepe both, or
wake, at one &amp; the ſame tyme, in which
he has a viſion in which he ſies mee.
What meruelle is it if ded people ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
knowing, nor fieling theſe things,
yet ar viewed by the liuing in their
dreames, &amp; vtter ſomething which
thoſe who ar awake knowne to be
true. Wherefore I ſhould thinke it
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:19452:18"/>
to be effected by Angelical operations,
whether it be permitted, or commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aboue that theſe ſhould ſieme
to vtter ſom'at in their ſliepe touching
the buriall o'their bodies, althou' they
ble quite ignorant whoſe bodies they
be. And this is ſometymes profitably
effected, whether it be to giue ſome
sort of comfort to the liuing to whome
thoſe ded people apperteyne whoſe
repreſentations appiere to the drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers;
or to the intent that by theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions
the humanitie of Sepulture
may be recommended to humane gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
which althou' it helpes not the
deceaſed, yet is it culpable irreligioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e
to neglect it.</p>
            <p>Yet ſometimes people are carried
to great errors by fallatious viſions,
who iuſtly deferue to ſuffer ſuch illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions;
as for example if one ſhould
viewe that which <hi>Aeneas</hi> by poeticall
falſitie is related to haue ſiene in the
infernal regions, &amp; that the figure
of ſome unſepulcherd perſon ſhould
appeare vnto him, &amp; vtter ſuch par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
as <hi>Palinurus</hi> is recounted to
have vtterd to <hi>Aeneas,</hi> &amp; that when
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:19452:18"/>
he awakes he ſhould finde his bodie in
the ſame place in which he heard it
to be, whyle he dreamed, &amp; was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed
&amp; requeſted to burie it when
he had found it, that in regard he
perceiued it to be true, he ſhould for
that cauſe bilieue that, the ded are
therefore buried that their ſoules may
paſſe to thoſe places. Does not he who
bilienes theſe matters very much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitate
from the way o'trueth? For
ſuch is humane infirmitie, that when
anie one ſies one ded in his ſliepe, he
imagins, he ſies his ſoule, but when he.
Sembleably dreames of anie one aliue,
he doutes not but that nether his
bodie, nor his ſoule, but the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of a man appiered to him, as if
not the ſoules, but the ſimilitudes
o' people ſoules being in the ſame ſort
ignorant, could not appiere to thoſe
who dreame.</p>
            <p>When I was at <hi>Milan,</hi> I heard for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine
that when a dette was demanded
of one by producing the bond of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
deceaſed (which det had bin paid
vnknown to his ſonne) he began to be
very much co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>triſtated, &amp; to admire that
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:19452:19"/>
his Father dying had not declared his
dets vnto him, ſuppoſing he made
a will. Then his Father appeared to
him being very much perplexed, in his
ſliepe, &amp; ſignifyed where it was recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that the bond was cancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led:
which being found, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
the young man not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
the calumniation o'the falſe
dette, but alſo receued the acquittance
which his Father had not receued
when he paied the money. In this caſe
therefore it is conceued that the ſoule
o'the Father had care of his Sonne, &amp;
to haue come to him being a ſliepe, to
the intent that teiching him that which
he ignored, he might deliuer him from
a great moleſtation. Yea &amp; amoſt at
the verie ſame tyme, at which we
heard this, that is, I being at Milan,
<hi>Eulogius</hi> the Rhetoritian of Carthage,
who was my Scholler in the ſame Art,
as himſelfe after my returne into Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca
related to me, when he expounded
to his Schollers <hi>Cicero's</hi> books of Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torique,
peruſing the leſſon which he
was to deliuer to them the day inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
he founde a certeyne obſcure place
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:19452:19"/>
which not vnderſtanding he could
ſcarce ſliepe for care, to whome being
in a dreame that might, I expounded
that to him which he did not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
yea not I, but my figure, I igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
it, &amp; ether imployed in farre dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
matters beyond the ſeas, or not
caring a iot for his cares. Howe theſe
things are effected I knowe not, but
in what euer manner they are effected,
why bilieue we not they are effected
in the ſame manner that one viewes
one in his ſliepe ded, in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as it is effected that he viewes one
aliue, certeinly nether o'them ether
knowing or caring, where, when
or who dreames o'their figures, or
ſhapes.</p>
            <p>Sembleable to dreames are alſo ſome
viſions of the liuing who haue their
ſenſes troubled, as are thoſe of fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique
people, or in anie ſort furious,
for theſe alſo ſpeike to them ſelues as
if they ſpake to thoſe who are really
preſent, as well with the abſent as the
preſent whoſe figures they viewe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a liue or ded. But euen as thoſe
who liue know not that they are view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:19452:20"/>
by them, or that they ſpeake wi'the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
for that inrealitie they are nether pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
nor diſcourſe wi'them, but only
being people troubled in their ſenſes,
they ſuffer ſuch imaginarie viſions: in
the ſame faſhion thoſe who haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
this life, to people thus affected
ſeeme to be preſent when they are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
not knowing at all whether anie
bodie, imaginarily viewes them.</p>
            <p>Of this ſame nature is alſo that other
matter, vizt; when people ar ſubſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
from their corporal ſenſes, &amp; poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
with ſuch viſions more profund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
than if they ſliepe. An to theſe alſo
appiere the reſemblances both o'the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,
&amp; the ded, but when they returne
to their ſenſes who euer they affirme
they haue ſiene ded, they are truly cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited
to haue bin with them: nether
conſider they who heare theſe matters
that ſembleably the reſemblances alſo
o'ſome liuing ar viewed, they remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
abſent &amp; ignorant o'the ſame.</p>
            <p>A certeine ordinarie perſon <hi>Curina</hi>
by name, in the Incorporation of <hi>Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie</hi>
which is verie neare to the Cittie
Hippon, a poure officer, &amp; ſcarce in the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:19452:20"/>
ranke of a <hi>Diumuir</hi> in that place, &amp; an
abſolute ruſtique being ſick &amp; depriued
of his ſenſes he laye ſome certeine daies
amoſt ded, yet a very ſmal breath remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in his noſe which by putting tou
ones hand was ſcarce perceiued, ſerued
for a ſlender ſigne of his life, which as
one aſtoniſhed ſufferd him not to be
buried. He moued not one member, hee
recelued no ſuſtenance, he perceiued
nothing with his eyes, nor felt anie
paine he was put tou in anie other of
his corporal ſenſes: neuertheleſſe he ſae
manie things in his ſliepe which at
length after manie daies awaking he
related. And in primis as ſoune as he
open'd his eyes: let ſome bodie goe
(quoth he) to <hi>Curina</hi> the ſmith's houſe,
&amp; know what is done there: when the
meſsiuger came thither, he was founde
to haue died at the ſame moment in
which this man was reſtor'd to his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
&amp; had reuiued a moſt from deth.
Then he ſignified to thoſe who were
preſent with attention, that <hi>Curina</hi> the
ſmith was commanded to appiere at
the time of his owne diſmiſsion: &amp;
that he heard in the place whence he
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:19452:21"/>
returned that, not Curina the <hi>Curial,</hi>
but Curina the Smith was commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to be adduced to thoſe places
o'the ded. Therefore in thoſe viſions
as in his dreames, it was aduertiſſed
that among thoſe deceaſed people
which he ſae, ſome were treated
according to the diuerſitie o'their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.
Alſo ſome he obſerued whome he
had knowne alyue. But I perhaps,
ſhould haue bilieued them to be ded,
if he in thoſe his, as it were dreames,
had not ſiene ſome who are yet alyue
at this preſent, vizt; ſome preiſts of his
countrie; by whoſe preiſt ther, he was
inſtructed to that purpoſe that he
might be me baptized at Hippon,
which he ſaid was performed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he ſae in that viſion a preiſt, cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes,
&amp; my ſelfe not yet ded, in which
ſame viſion he alſo ſae ſuch as were
ded. Why ſhould he not be ſuppoſed
to haue ſiene them as well as vs, both
of vs, being abſent, &amp; ignorant of this,
&amp; accordingly not to haue ſiene the
perſons themſelues, but their reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances,
or figures, as alſo the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances
o'the places? for he both ſae
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:19452:21"/>
the field in which that preiſt was,
with the clerkes, &amp; the Citie Hippone
where he was as it were baptized. In
which places certainely he was not
when there he ſiemed to bee. For he
knew not what was done ther at that
tyme: which doutleſſe he would haue
knowne if verily he had bin there.
Therefore theſe matters were ſiene
which ar not preſented in the things
as they ar in their nature, but as they
ar adumbrated, or ſhadowed in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
images of things.</p>
            <p>Finally, after manie things which
he viewed, he related that he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced
in to Paradyſe, &amp; that it was
ſaid to him at the tyme of his diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
redie to returne to his frendes:
goe be baptized if thou wil be in that
place o'the bleſſed. Further more
being admoniſhed to be baptized, he
anſerd it was a'redie done. To whome
he with whome he ſpake replyed goe,
quoth hee, &amp; be truly baptized, for
thou ſaeſt that in a viſion. After this
he recouer, &amp; went to Hippon: Eaſter
now approached, he deliuerd his
name among other <hi>Competents</hi> with
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:19452:22"/>
verie manie others in lyke manner vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne
to vs. Nether had he care to
notifye his viſion to mie, or to anie of
myne. He was baptized; &amp; the holie
dayes being paſt, he returnd home.
After a yeare or two tranſacted, or
more, I knewe all theſe particulars
firſt by a frend of his &amp; myne at my ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
when we diſcourſed aboute ſome
ſuch matters. Then I vrged, &amp; cauſed
him to relate theſe things in preſenſe
to me, his honeſt citticens teſtifying
both his ſtrange infirmitie, how he had
layne almoſt ded, for the ſpace of
manie dayes, &amp; o'that other Curina
the Smith which I aboue mentioned,
&amp; when he related me all theſe matter,
they alſo then rememberd, &amp; auerred
that they had heard them of him.
Wherefore as he ſae his owne bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme,
&amp; mie; &amp; the Cittie Hippone,
the Church, &amp; the fonte, not in the
things them ſelues but in certaine
ſimilitudes, ſo alſo did he view ſome
other certaine lyue perſons they not
knowing it.</p>
            <p>Why therefore might he not viewe
thoſe ded perſons they not knowing
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:19452:22"/>
it? why bilieue we not theſe operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to be Angelical by the diſpenſation
of Gods prouidence who vſes well
both goud &amp; ill things according to the
inſcrutable profunditie of his iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
whether mortal mens myndes
be hence inſtructed, or deceiued, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they be comforted, or terrified: as
to euerie one ether mercie is to be exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited,
or reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge to be irrogated by him
to whome the Church ſings mercie &amp;
iudgement not in vaine. Let euerie one
take as he pleaſe that which I wil ſaye.</p>
            <p>If the ſoules o'the ded were preſent

quyet whome the inquyet lyfe o'the

which God promiſed for a great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:19452:23"/>
to the moſt pyous King <hi>Ioſias,</hi>
that he ſhould dye afore, leaſt he
ſhould ſie thoſe miſchiefes which he
menaced futurely to happen to that
place, &amp; people? which wordes of God
are theſe. <hi>Thus ſayes the Lord God of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael:
my words which thou dideſt heare, &amp;
feared afore my face whyle thou hear deſt
them, which I ſpake o'this place, &amp; thoſe
who inhabit in it, that it be left deſolate
&amp; in malediction: and thou dideſt tiere
thy garments and cryed in my conſpect,
and hearing, and the Lord of Sabath
ſaid: not ſo, loe I will put the with thy
Fathers, and thou ſhalt be placed with
peace; and thy eyes shall not view all
thoſe miſeries which I will induce into
this place, and to the people which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habite
in it.</hi> This King being terrifyed
with Gods comminations, had cryed;
&amp; tore his garments, &amp; was ſecured
from all future euils by the accelerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of a haſtie deth, that he ſhould ſo
reſt in peace as he ſhould not ſie them.
Therefore the ſpirits of the deceaſed
exiſte there where they ſhall not view
thoſe things which ar done, or chance
to people in this lyfe. How then ſie
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:19452:24"/>
they their owne ſepulchers, or their
owne bodies, or whether they lie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buried,
&amp; abiected? How are they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
at the miſeries of the liuing, ſince
that ether they ſuffer their owne euils
if ſuch merits they haue contracted, or
reſt in peace (as was promiſed to this
<hi>Ioſias</hi>) where they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ſteine no euils ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by ſuffering them ſelues, nor by
compaſsionating others, freed from all
thoſe euils which they ſufferd whyle
here they liued.</p>
            <p>Perhaps ſome one will ſaye, if the
ded haue no care o'the liuing, how did
that rich one whoe was tormented in
Hell praye Father <hi>Abraham</hi> to ſend
<hi>Lazarus,</hi> to his fyue brothers yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue,
&amp; to deale with them, leaſt they
alſo ſhould come to the ſame place of
torments? But did the rich one bicauſe
he ſaid this, therefore knowe what his
brothers did after or ſuffer at that time?<note place="margin">Prayet for the ded is to be vſed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thou we knowe not diſtinctlye the actions which they exerciſe in the other life.</note>
ſuch was his care of the liuing althou
he knewe not at all what they did, as
we haue care of the ded, althou? we
are quite ignorant what they doe. For
if we cared not for the ded, ſurely we
would not pray to God for them.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:19452:24"/>
Finally, nether did <hi>Abraham</hi> ſend <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus,</hi>
but anferd that they had <hi>Moyſes,</hi>
&amp; the Prophets hiere, whom they ought
to heare to the end they might not
come to thoſe puniſhments. Where it
recurres to be obſerued, how Father <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
knew not what hiere was done
where he knew <hi>Moyſes,</hi> &amp; the Prophets
to bee, that is their boukes by obeying
to whome, people might auoide thein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal
torments: where in concluſion,
he knew that rich one to haue liued in
deliciouſnes, but poure <hi>Lazarus</hi> in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor,
&amp; paines For this alſo he ſaies vnto
him. <hi>Reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber ſon that thou haeſt receiued
houd things in this lyfe, but Lazarns euil.</hi>
Therfore he knew thieſe things which
verily were done about the liuing, not
about the ded: yet not when they were
done about the liuing, but they being
ded he might knowe them by <hi>Lazarus</hi>
meanes leaſt it ſhould be falſe which
the Prophet affirmes. <hi>Abraham knew vs
not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Furthermore it is to be confeſſed
that indied the ded knowes not what
is done here, but this is while it is
done hiere for afterwards they heare of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:19452:25"/>
thoſe who dying departe hence, &amp; paſſe
to them: not indeed al things, but thoſe
which they are permitted to diſcloſe,
who alſo are permitted to remember
them, &amp; ſuch as thoſe muſt heare to
whome they notifye them.</p>
            <p>The ded alſo may by the Angels
which ar preſent at thoſe things which
here ar done, heare ſome thing which
he to whome all things are ſubiect,
iudges neceſſarie for them to heare?
For vnleſſe there were Angels which
could be preſent both in the places
o'the liuing, &amp; the ded, our Lord Ieſus
would not haue ſaid, <hi>it chanced that
poure man dyed, &amp; was caried by Angels
into the boſome of Abraham.</hi> Therefore
they could be now here, &amp; now there,
who caried away him whome God
would haue them. Alſo the ſoules of
the ded may knowe ſome things done
here which Gods Spirit reueling them
are neceſſarie for them to know, and
which it is not neceſſarie for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not to
knowe, not onely paſt, or preſent, but
alſo future matters. As not all ſortes of
people but the Prophets knewe while
they liued here: nether knew they all
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:19452:25"/>
things, but thoſe which the diuine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence
iudged neceſſarie to be reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
vnto them. An diuine Scripture al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
teſtifyes that ſome o'the ded are ſent
to the liuing, as contrarily that <hi>Paule</hi>
was rapt from the liuing into Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radyſe.
For the Prophet <hi>Samuel</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
deceaſed, <hi>predicted</hi> future things
alſo to King <hi>Saul</hi> alyue: althou'ſome
are of opinion it was not hee who
could be <hi>euocated</hi> by art magique, but
ſome ill ſpirit agreable to ſuch an ill
action; which repreſented his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
ſince that the bouke of Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticus
which Ieſus the Sonne of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rach</hi>
is deliuered to haue writte, and
is affirmed to be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Salomons,</hi> for ſome
ſimilitude in the ſtyle, conteines in
the commendation o'the Fathers, that
<hi>Samuel</hi> euen being ded, prophicyed.
But if contradiction be made vnto<note place="margin">The Iewes reiect the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que, but S. Auſtin places it in the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an canon. lib. 2. de doctrin. Chriſt. cap. 8.</note>
this bouke by the canon o'the Iewes
(for it is not extant in it) what ſhall
we ſay of <hi>Moyſes</hi> whoe certainely
is red both in the Deuteronomie to
haue binded, &amp; in the Euangel to haue
appiered to the liuing with <hi>Elias</hi> who
is not ded.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:19452:26"/>
Hence alſo that other queſtion is
ſolued, vizt, in what manner the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs
ſignifye by the benefits which ar
conferred to thoſe who praye, that
they ar preſent at humane buſineſſes,
if the ded knowe not what the liuing
doe. For we haue heard not by incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
rumors, but by ſure witneſſes,
that Felix the Confeſſor appiered to
the inhabitants of Nola, which he
piouſly loued when it was oppug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the Barbarians, not only by
the effects of his benefits, but alſo
to the viewe o'the people. But thieſe
things ar exhibited by diuine opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
farre different from the vſuall
courſe, which is attributed to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
ſorte o'creature. For we muſt
not therefore not diſcerne the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
which is betwixt the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of water in its proper order of
elements, &amp; the raritie, or rather
ſingularitie o'this diuine operation,
cauſe our Lord where he pleaſed
ſodainely turned water into wyne.
Nether bicauſe ded <hi>Lazarus</hi> rize a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
therefore euerie one ded, riſes
when he will, nor is he in the ſame
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:19452:26"/>
manner reuyued by one liuing, when
he is aſtoniſhed, in which he is awaked
when he is a ſliepe by one who is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake.
Wherefore one thing is the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
of humane matters, &amp; an other
the ſignes of diuine power, thoſe
things which ar naturally effected,
ar one, &amp; thoſe which miraculouſly,
an other: althou' God both aſsiſts na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
that it may haue exiſtence, &amp; alſo
nature is not awanting to miracles. It
is not thierefore to be imagined that
euerie diſceaſed perſon can be preſent
at the affaires o'the liuing, cauſe Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs
ar preſent ether to cure, or ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>core
ſome particular people: but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it is to be knowne that Martyrs
are therefore preſent at the affaires of
the liuing by diuine power cauſe the
deceaſed canot by their owne proper
nature be preſent at the affaires o'the
liuing. How be it this queſtion ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciedes
the powers of my intendiment,
how it is that the Martyrs helpe thieſe
who are certainely helped by them:
whether they by themſelues are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
at the ſame time in ſo diuers, &amp;
ſo farre diſtant places, ether where
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:19452:27"/>
their <hi>memories</hi> ar, or in other places
beſyde their monuments where ſoeuer
they ar knowne to be preſent, or elſe
whether, they exiſting in a place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable
to their merits, remote from
all conuerſation of mortal men, &amp; yet
generally praying for the neceſsities
o'their <hi>Supplicants,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Marke. It is expedient to the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of Chriſtian faith for God to vſe the mediation of his Saints for the cure, &amp; conforte of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in their neceſſities.</note> as we praye for
the ded to whome neuer the leſſe
we ar not preſent, nor knowe where
they bie or what they doe; God
omnipotent who is preſent in euerie
place, &amp; nether commixed with vs,
nor remote from vs, hearing the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of his Martyrs, by Angelical Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie
euerie way diffuſed, exhibites
to people theſe ſolaces, which he
iudges neceſſarie to be exhibited, who
by ineffable power, and bonitie co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
the merits of his Martyrs where
he will, when he will, &amp; as he will, &amp;
chiefely by their memories, in regarde
he knowes this is expedient to the
edification o'the faith of Chriſt for
whoſe confeſsion they ſufferd. This
matter is hyer than I can atteine to, &amp;
more abſtruſe than I am able to ſearch
out &amp; therefore which o'theſe twoe,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:19452:27"/>
or elſe whether perhaps both is ſo,
vizt; that ſome tymes by the verie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
o'the Martyrs, &amp; ſometymes by

dare not determine, I would rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyre
theſe matters o'thoſe who
knowe them; nether is ther none whoe
knowe theſe matters, nor none who
fieme to them ſelues to knowne them,
&amp; yet knowe them not: for theſe ar
Gods donations, who liberally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferres
ſome to one, &amp; ſome to others
according to the Apoſtle who affirmes
that the manifeſtation o'the ſpirit is
giuen to euerie one for their profitte.
To one, quoth he, is giuen by the ſpirit
the worde of <hi>Sapience,</hi> to an other is
giuen, by the ſpirit the worde of
knowlige, to an other the worde of
ſcience according to the ſame ſpirit,
but to an other faith in the ſame ſpirit,
to an other the guifte of cures in one
ſpirit, to an other operations of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
to an other Prophecie, to an other
diſcernement of ſpirits, to an other
diuerfitie of languages, to an other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-pretation
o'wordes: but one, &amp;
the ſame ſpirit operates all theiſe, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyding
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:19452:28"/>
to euerie one that which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to them, as he pleaſes. To whome
euer is conferred the diſcernement of
ſpirits, he knowes theſe things as they
are to be knowne.</p>
            <p>Such a one it is to be bilieued Iohn
the Monke to haue bin, whome Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſius
the greater conſulted touching
the euent o'the ciuille warre, bicauſe
he had alſo the gift o'prophecie. For
nether doute I but that not onely eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
one in particular may haue euerie
one o'theſe <hi>Dones,</hi> but alſo that one
may haue manie; wherefore this Iohn
ſaid to a certaine woman verie Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,
impatiently deſyring to fie
him, &amp; vehemently inſtanceing by her
husbands meanes to obteine her deſyre,
when he refuſed in regarde he neuer
permitted this to women, goe, quoth
he, tell thy wyfe ſhe ſhall fie me the
next night, but in her ſliepe: &amp; it was
performed. He admoniſhed her tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
all that which a fidelious wyfe
ought to be admoniſhed. Whoe when
ſhe awaked, ſhe fignifyed to her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
ſhe had ſiene the man of God in
ſuch a forme as ſhe had knowne him.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:19452:28"/>
He who had knowlige o'this from
them, related it to mie, a graue &amp; noble
perſonage, &amp; who verie much deſerued
to be credited. But if I my ſelfe had
ſiene that ſaintlie Monke, in regarde,
as it is reported, he moſt patiently ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferd
himſelfe to be interrogated; &amp; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerd
moſt diſcrietly, I would haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyred
of him that which perteines
to this queſtion: whether he, that is, his
ſpirit in the figure of his bodie, came
to that woman in her ſliepe, as we drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
of our ſelues in the ſhape of our
bodies: or elſe he being otherwyſe oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupyed,
or if he ſlept, otherwiſe drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
whether by an Angel, or in anie
other manner, ſuch a viſion was made,
&amp; that he knew afore by prophetical
ſpirit reueling, it was afterwarde
to come to paſſe that he ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe
it. For if he was preſent to
the dreamer, certainely he had pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to doe it by admirable grace,
not by nature, &amp; by Gods donation,
not by his owne proper forces. But
if he ether being in other matters im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed,
or elſe in a dreame, and
buſied with other viſions, the woman
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:19452:29"/>
ſae him in her ſliepe, verily ſome ſuch
matter was effected, as that which we
riede in the Acts of the Apoſtles where
our Lord Ieſus ſpeikes to <hi>Ananias</hi>
touching <hi>Sanl,</hi> &amp; ſignifies to him that
<hi>Saul</hi> ſae <hi>Ananias</hi> coming to him when
<hi>Ananias</hi> himſelfe did not knowe it.
Whether euer o'theiſe that man of
God ſhould haue anſerd me, I would
alſo prociede to inquyre of him tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the Martyrs, whether they ar
preſent in ſliepe, or to thoſe who ſie
them in anie other facion, in what
forme they pleaſe, &amp; chiefely when
the Deuils confeſſe they ar tormented
by them in peoples bodies, &amp; praye
them to ſpare them: or whether theiſe

by Angelicall powers in honor
and comendation o'the Saints for the
profit of men, they remaining in ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine
reſt, and attending to an other
much better viſion; ſeparated from vs,
and praying for vs.</p>
            <p>For at <hi>Milan</hi> at <hi>S. Geruaſius</hi> &amp; <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſius</hi>
