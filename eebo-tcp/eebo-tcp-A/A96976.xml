            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F the Enemy of mankinde did not ſhew unto Sectaries the face of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in a falſe Glaſs; in which he makes the very Spouſe of Chriſt (ſhe that is ſo beautifull, with ſo lovely features, and of ſo comely a comportment in her ſelf) appear to the delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded eyes of ſo many ſouls ill-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, ugly, and in a manner monſtruous; and on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſets out other Sects (though never ſo contemptable in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) for beauties, moſt gracious and attractive: diſputes and <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>arrels about Religion would
<pb facs="tcp:119650:3"/>be ſoon compoſed: for the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall comlineſſe of the one, and the uglineſſe of the others (covered onely with a painted exteriour) would eaſily diſcover themſelves.</p>
            <p>My endeavour therefore ſhall be to unbeguile theſe people, and ſhew them both parties, as they are in their own native colours: for effecting of which, I have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen a new <hi>medium,</hi> or at leaſt a new manner ofpropoſing the old: many Elaborate works have been publiſhed in Vindication of the true Faith, and in confutation of falſhood; which undoubtedly were convincing enough: but becauſe both experience, and the ingenuous acknowledgement of many, teach, that though the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect in many thouſands reſt convinced; yet the will holds back, and will not execute what the underſtanding dictates ought to be done: Therefore I (reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb facs="tcp:119650:3"/>not to be backward in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing my endeavours towards the common good) thought it not a miſſe to handle this great buſineſſe of Religion, by way of Meditation (rather than by that of argumentation;) as being the moſt efficacious way to move the will; beſides, its being the moſt clear and eaſie way of propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things to the underſtanding: eſpecially, ſince the ſubject I take in hand, is both ſpiritual, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for Meditation; to wit, the marks of the church. For who can doubt but Sanctity of life and Doctrine; the gift of Miracles and of Propheſying; converſion of Souls, Martyrdome, and the like, are a very connaturall matter for Meditation.</p>
            <p>But as the beſt maſters of ſpirit adviſe, that in delivering matter to Meditate upon, ſome points, or conſiderations be ſuggeſted to
<pb facs="tcp:119650:4"/>the exercitant, thereby to facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the buſineſſe for him; and yet that all that may be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon ſuch a ſubject, be not ambitiouſly introduced, leaſt the others underſtanding be preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and foreſtalled: So have I in this little work endeavoured to proceed; ſetting down upon each matter only ſome chief con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, which may give the Reader occaſion to ſearch further himſelf. I have alſo added ſome affections and Colloquies thereby to further the motions of the will.</p>
            <p>As for the matter of the enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Meditations, to wit, the Marks of the Church; this I may truly ſay of them, that as they are in themſelves a moſt noble matter, and moſt worthy of a Chriſtians Meditation and Study: ſo are they of all other, the moſt facile <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> forcible means, whereby to
<pb facs="tcp:119650:4"/>finde out the true Church: That Catholick who hath a deſire to make a quick diſpatch of his Adverſary, let him encounter him with theſe Weapons: they are an unknown treaſure, and not unlike to <hi>Ariſtoles</hi> To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks, in that they are as it were common places, or foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, out of which reaſons and arguments, both to impugn falſe Sects, and alſo to defend the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Religion, are eaſily at any time drawn: Art thou demanded the reaſon, why thou art a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick? Anſwer: <hi>Becauſe that Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath the marks of Chriſts true church upon it; and conſequently is it.</hi> Art thou deſirous to find out that onely ſoul-ſaving Faith of Chriſt? look where thou canſt finde theſe marks, and there thou haſt it; and where theſe are wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; aſſuredly, there the true Church is not: Haſt thou a mind
<pb facs="tcp:119650:5"/>truly to underſtand how incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable a benefit God hath beſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed upon thee, in making thee a member of that church, out of w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> no ſalvatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can be hoped for; read and meditate this matter, which will inform thee. Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks indeed have more and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er texts out of the propheticall &amp; &amp; apoſtolick writers, than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sect can introduce in their own behalf; yet the latter have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways evaſions, either by appealing from one ſentence to another, or elſe by inſiſting upon their own private expoſition; reduce them therefore to this matter of the marks of the Church, and you will ſoon have them faſt.</p>
            <p>One thing is worthy, yea neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be well underſtood by all: and this is that the marks of the Church (which are the motives in point of religion) may be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red two ways; to wit, either as they
<pb facs="tcp:119650:5"/>are antecedent to faith; or as they are ſubſequent, and things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves believed with divine faith: for all chriſtians, who receive the the ſcriptures for divine, muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve with divine faith, that Chriſt gave to his church the gift of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king miracles, &amp; of propheſyings &amp; that the church is but one, and antienter than all other Sects a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt chriſtians; that in it there are holy members; that its doctrin is holy, and efficacious to convert ſouls; that it hath continued ever ſince chriſts time, &amp; ſhal do ſtil un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the world have an end; that the propheſies of the old law are ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled by chriſt, and his church: all theſe, or the moſt of them, muſt be believed as divine truths by chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; for they are expreſſed in the holy ſcripture; as will appear in the firſt point of the ſucceeding meditations. So that ſectaries muſt believe the true Church to be, where theſe marks are.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:119650:6"/>
            <p>But the ſame things may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo conſidered as they are prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding divine Faith, and go before it; yea, or wholly independent of it; and in this acception only they are motives of credibility; yet moſt powerfully perſwaſive: For by demonſtrating to Athieſts, Pagans, or other non-Chriſtians, out of humane hiſtory, and out of the ſcriptures (received only for books of humane authority, yet held by thouſands of prudent, and learned men for authenticall, and of great credit) that ſuch and ſuch prodigious things, or miracles (and the like may be urged in ſtrange predictions of future things contingent fulfilled, in a ſtrange contempt of worldly things, and in ſome other ſuch like rareties) are recounted by ſo many authors of the greateſt humane authority: this cannot but convince them, that there is
<pb facs="tcp:119650:6"/>a Deity; that this Diety rules the World by a moſt wiſe Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; that the ſame Deity (by order of good conſequence) is to be worſhipped by ſome form of Religion; and that that is in all likelihood, yea in all certainty, the moſt credible and true, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of which are conſpicuous by ſuch things, as out reach the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of nature or art: for ſuch perſons queſtion leſſe have confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and hold correſpondence with God: and <hi>de facto,</hi> Inſidels were brought to embrace the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Faith, by theſe motives, as the cheifeſt inducements.</p>
            <p>The truth is, That it is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in all mens opinion morally, but as many learned Divines teach metaphyſically impoſſible, that that Religion ſhould be falſe, which God hath confirmed with his own Hand and Seal; I mean, with theſe Arguments, Motives,
<pb facs="tcp:119650:7"/>and Marks, which the abſolute power of God onely could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce: for otherwiſe it would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that God ſhould induce men into error, and be the author of falſhood; a thing which implies a contradiction, and is incompatible with the goodnes and veracity of God: and would make the divine will repugnant to it ſelf, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding men to ſerve him in the true Religion, and yet leading them to a falſe one, by the whole complex of ſuch, and ſo extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary motives as theſe are.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the inſtruction, and conviction of non-chriſtians, and ſuch as do not admit the holy ſcripture to be the word of God. Concerning which people I adde, that when any of them are come ſo far, as to believe with humane faith (which may be in every ones power to do) that theſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
<pb facs="tcp:119650:7"/>convince that to be the true church, which is confirmed by thoſe divine ſignes; and when they do accept of that Church for ſuch: God will undoubtedly raiſe their humane Faith up to be divine; by infuſing into them the auxiliary forces of his ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral grace, and light, with the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of divine faith.</p>
            <p>Now for the better underſtanding how from humane faith, a man may aſcend to an act of divine faith: Note the diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt theſe four principles, into which an act of faith may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved. Firſt the <hi>extrinſical mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives:</hi> and theſe are not, nor can they be the efficient cauſe of an act of divine faith: but they are diſpoſitions: that is they are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, or cauſe why that Religion, or ſuch a point, is accepted on for the truth.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:119650:8"/>
            <p>Secondly, The <hi>Authority of the Churchs</hi> and ſhe doth onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound what is to be believed, and gives order and direction how to proceed in the carriage of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The <hi>Veracity of God revealing</hi> to the Church, and by the Church to us, divine truths: and this is the formall object, or cauſe, why the underſtanding aſſents to ſuch a thing as a divine truth: for therefore we believe that ſuch Books are Divine, becauſe God hath revealed to the Church, that they are ſo.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The <hi>habit of Divine Faith,</hi> together with divine grace: and theſe are the efficient cauſe of an act of Divine Faith.</p>
            <p>All theſe four principles inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene in the <hi>analyſis</hi> of theologicall Faith; but with ſubordination to one another, and not as ſo many independent firſt principles of
<pb facs="tcp:119650:8"/>Faith: for the firſt, immediate, and indemonſtrable cauſe of mans aſſent, is God revealing; though the cauſe of accepting ſuch a faith muſt be the motives of credibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
            <p>I conclude this Preface, with giving the Reader notice, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I begin with the Meditations of the particular Marks (of which I have choſen out onely 16.) I thought fit to premiſe 4 Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which are both of moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary ſubjects in themſelves, as alſo preparatives for the more fruitfull peruſage of thoſe which follow: And for a clearer demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration to Sectaries, that ſuch and ſuch are put for marks of Chriſts Church by ſcripture it ſelf; I have of ſet purpoſe cited the proofs u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſally out of the Proteſtants own Bible.</p>

                  <head>The third Point.</head>
                  <p>Conſider now what uſe is to be made of this ſo admirable means, and proviſion for mans ſupernatural end: and firſt thoſe, who are already incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated members of the true Church, have reaſon to render praiſes to God eternally, for ſo facilitating the work of their Salvation by theſe ample means: Secondly, an oblation (and that a great one) is upon them, of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponding with their indeavours to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a diligent application, and a well ordered uſe of thoſe means; for aſſuredly they ſhall be reſponſible to God for the intereſt of thoſe ſo many, and great Talents, with which they are intruſted. <q>

                  </p>
                  <p>As for thoſe, who are not members of the true Church of Chriſt: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſome content themſelves with the bare <hi>extrinſecall denomination</hi> of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant, Presbyterian, or Independent;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:119650:13"/>not troubling themſelves with the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents of theſe Sects; nay, nor ſo much as knowing how many, or what they are: Others, are of a <hi>Religion ut ſic;</hi> a Platonick <hi>Idea</hi> they have in their heads, and thats all: of ſome one they are, but of no one in particular: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (like <hi>individua Vaga</hi>) run from Sect to Sect, will be of every Religion; &amp; are carried about with every whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winde of new Doctrine: and others (to omit other varieties of new faſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Sects in theſe our mad times) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themſelves with <hi>Negations;</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the little better than non-exiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of their Religion, by the onely Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives of the Roman Catholike affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative Tenents. All theſe (I ſay) and ſuch as are not members of Chriſts true Church, or doubt how the caſe ſtands with them in point of religion; let them ask, and anſwer themſelves, whether or no, they ſeriouſly love, and long for life eternal: if they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it: then let them love, ſeek for, and finde out the true Church; for that alone is the means to acquire that happy end: if they be careleſſe, indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent,

                  <p>Hence inferre, of what infinite mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is deliberation, and choice of Religion: to hit right, or miſſe that mark, is to hazard the winning, or loſing heaven: Heaven is the Wager, Reſolution ſhoots the Arrow, the true Church is the white, let delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration take right aym, and earneſtly beg the direction of the Almighty, <q>(<hi>who hath alſo bent his how and prepared it</hi>) by ſaying, Lord, <hi>demonſtrate unto me thy wayes, and teach me thy paths: ſend forth thy light and thy truth,</hi> that they may lead me unto thy holy mountain and into the Tabernacles of thy Church. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <head>The firſt Point.</head>
                  <p>Conſider firſt, what Faith is, both in reſpect of the habit and the act: <hi>Habitual Faith,</hi> is a ſupernatural ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, infuſed by God into the ſoule of man, by which his underſtanding is illuminated, inabled, and inclined to believe ſtedfaſtly all thoſe things to be true, which God hath revealed to his Church: It differs much from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther intellectuall habits: as from Science, which relyes on the evidence of the thing, Faith on Authority, to wit, of God: From opinion, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, ſuſpicion; which do not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisſie the underſtanding; Faith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth it, from civil, or humane faith, which is ſubject to error; but Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logicall and divine Faith is that, <hi>cui non poteſt ſubeſſe falſum:</hi> no falſhood dare inſinuate it ſelf into the company of Divine Faith: <hi>Actuall Faith,</hi> is no
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:119650:15"/>other thing but the exerciſe, or act proceeding from the habit of Faith: it is a firm aſſent of the underſtanding, believing ſuch particulars revealed by God (to wit, that one and the ſelf ſame nature and eſſence of God, is in three diſtinct perſons; that Chriſt is both God and man, and yet not two, but only one thing; that there is hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that there is hell, and the like) to be true: ſo that the material things believed are the objects of thoſe acts.</p>
                  <p>Conſider ſecondly, The inſallible certainty, which an act of divine faith hath in it: the certainty of it hangs upon theſe two cardinal attributes of divine wiſdome and goodneſſe: by the former of which, we are warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that God cannot by ignorance be deceived; by the ſecond, we are ſecured that he will not deceive, by revealing that for a truth, which is falſe; ſince both theſe perfections are in him infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite: This infinite authority there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of God revealing, being the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, or formal object of an act of faith (for therefore we believe ſuch a thing to be true, becauſe God hath revealed
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:119650:15"/>it) makes theſe acts moſt true.</p>
                  <p>Gather hence what an admirable benefit the gift of divine Faith is; and not the habit onely, but the acts alſo are ſuch; ſince to the producing of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of them, is required a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous cogitation, and a pious affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the will (beſides the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mans endeavour) both which are favours from Almighty God.

                  <p>Conſider now the neceſſity of this virtue of Divine Faith; firſt, from the Teſtimonies of holy Scripture: <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith</hi> (faith Saint <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to pleaſe God.</hi> He that ſhall be found at his death devoid of this virtue, ſhall not onely not pleaſe God (a miſery great enough) but ſhall moreover in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably incur the greateſt of all miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, eternal damnation: <hi>He that will not believe ſhall be condemned;</hi> fearfull words, but ſpoken by Chriſt himſelf:

                  <p>Conſider alſo, that as the eye is the light of the body, and the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the natural eye and light of the Soule; ſo Divine Faith, is the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural light of the underſtanding: <hi>Niſi credideritis non intelligetis:</hi> what ſay you (<hi>Socinians</hi>) to this Oracle of divine Truth? <hi>unleſſe you believe:</hi> what?

                     <note place="margin">Eph. 2.8.</note> acts are rational, and it an intellectual habit: but this is not to make natural reaſon the formal object, or baſis, and ultimate reſolution of maters of faith: Mans intellect hath but a ſmall ſphere of activity in Order to a perception of divine things, but ſo ſarre forth as it is elevated by Divine Faith: As for us, who hope we are true believers, let not us content our ſelves with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane.

                  <p>The <hi>Affirmative Precept,</hi> obligeth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one to believe actually and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſome particular points of Faith; and the reſt implicitly, or in general; that is, all whatſoever the holy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church believes: yet ſo in general; that every one is bound to be in a readineſſe and diſpoſition, to embrace and aſſent to the other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, when and accordingly, as they ſhall be ſufficiently propounded by the true Church.</p>
                  <p>Now for a better information of what particulars are expreſly to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved; Note, that of theſe materiall objects, or points of Faith, ſome are ſo eſſentially requiſite to ſalvation, that a pure non-knowledgement, or not believing them expreſly, and in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:119650:17"/>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 6.</note> is deſtructive of ſalvation: theſe are called neceſſary <hi>neceſſitate medii:</hi> ſuch are theſe two, which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> mentions in theſe words: <hi>but without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God; for he that cometh to God, muſt believe that he is,</hi> (to wit, that there is a God) <hi>and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him.</hi> Here it is expreſly ſet down, that there is no coming to God, no enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, without believing that there is a God, and that he is a rewarder: and theſe two are to be believed by all, even <hi>Ethnicks</hi> and <hi>Infidels:</hi> But thoſe to whom the Evangelicall law hath been ſufficiently propounded, muſt believe (beſides theſe two) Chriſt and the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Trinity. Other things are onely neceſſarily to be known, and expreſly to be believed, <hi>neceſſitate proecepti;</hi> that is by reaſon of a precept obliging thereunto; ſuch are the <hi>Creed, the Ten Commandements,</hi> and thoſe of the Church, our <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> and the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments:</hi> Now lgnorance or want of actuall belief of theſe, is not inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with ſalvation: though negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in that point is ſeldom without ſin.</p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:119650:18"/>
                  <p>The <hi>Negative precept</hi> of Faith, is of a ſarre different nature from the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative; and obligeth all Chriſtians not to deny, or disbelieve any one point of Faith, ſufficiently propoſed by the Church, as a truth revealed by God: This admits no limitation, or latitude; the affirmative precept ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth from the material Points or Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; from which alſo (as they are more or leſſe neceſſary to be expreſly known, and believed) ariſeth that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of them into points Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental and not Fundamental: but the negativeprecept is taken from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Object, which is the infallible teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of God revealing; which being the ſame in allpoints, it makes all fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentalls a like: and here the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned diſtinction hath no place.</p>
                  <note place="margin">Note</note>
                  <p>Hence may be inferred what a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it is to deny, or disbelieve any one point, which the Church propoſeth as a revealed truth: It belongs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly to the goodneſs of Gods providence over his Church and m<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Firſt, becauſe otherwiſe men would be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually perplexed, full of frights and fears, and alwaies doubtful what were revealed, and to be believed, what not: Secondly, God commands us to belive under pain of damnation; therefore to disbelieve any one Propoſall of the Church is dangerous becauſe a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer of even any one point is neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er incurring that dreadfull ſentence, than he who disbelieves nothing: The Tenents of Roman Catholikes are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative; thoſe of Sectaries are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all negative; and conſequently not acts of belief: Hence alſo they are in greater danger of that Sentence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove mentioned; were not that alſo a hard ſentence, and repugnant to the ſweet mercy of God, unleſſe he ſhould by ſome means declare unto usplainly and clearly, what particulars we were to believe under ſo dreadful a penalty?

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:119650:19"/>eaſie means; for it hath never yet, nor can poſſibly end the many main Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverfies about points of Faith ſo long in agitation: This is a Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration therefore, that the Churches living, and clear voice, muſt do the deed; What She ſayes is true, is ſo?</p>

                  <head>The ſecond Point.</head>
                  <p>Conſider firſt, how that the Son of God deſcended from heaven, and inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted himſelf with humane nature, thereby to work that great work of mans eternal ſalvation: but by what means, and after what manner? One drop of his deified blood was a more than ſufficient ranſome for the whole World: any one of thoſe theandrical actions of his was a ſufficient ſumme for the purchaſe of eternal felicity for all mankind: for what end then was it, that he ſpent all the moments, which were contained in thirty three years ſo preciouſly? Why, did he ſhed every drop (even till water iſſued out of his ſacred ſide) of that his royall blood? The holy Doctours will tell us, that he did this for two ends, in order to us: Firſt, to make himſelf a perfect <hi>Prototypon</hi> (for man to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate) of all perfection, by the long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of all virtues; of which he left ſo many, and ſo rare examples: The ſecond was, that he might Found a Church, adorn it with all the requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:119650:21"/>proprieties, and priviledges which might beſeem ſuch a Church of ſuch a Founder; and that he might leave in it the infinite treaſures of his merits, to be diſpenced out by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors of it; and by means of the holy Sacraments applied to each member of the ſame. St <hi>Paul</hi> ſaies (and that in moſt weighty words) <hi>That the Church is ſuch a thing as coſt Chriſt the ſpending of his precious blood:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Acts</hi> 20, 28</note> which argues, that it is a rarer thing than Sectaries make it to be.</p>
                  <p>Conſider ſecondly, What this Church is: It is a body, a morall, or politick body; the members whereof are men, as the members of a Common wealth, or a City, or a Colledge are: Chriſts true Church therefore is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of People, called out (for ſo the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:119650:22"/>lineally from Chriſt and his Apoſtles, by a legall and continued ſucceſſion) whereof one is the Head, governing under Chriſt, and his Vicar.</p>
                  <p>Conſider thirdly, ſome inferences which may be drawn from what hath been conſidered: and firſt, a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of who are members of Chriſts true Church, and who are not: Three things are requiſite in the members thereof: 1. One and the ſame Faith and Belief of all revealed truths, and disbelief of no one; to wit, in thoſe who are come to the uſe of Reaſon, and have them ſufficiently propounded: Now for want of this Unity of Belief all Hereticks are excluded and Infidels. 2. Communion together in the ſame Sacraments, and form of worſhip; for want of this Catecumens (ſuch as are onely in preparation for Baptiſm) are not yet members of it. 3. Obedience and ſubjection to lawfull Paſtors; and for want of this Schiſmaticks are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded: And here now, you (poore ſouls) of ſo many ſeveral Sects; try what you are by theſe touch-ſtones.</p>
                  <p>Gather out of the precedent point
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:119650:22"/>three things; firſt, how dangerous it is in matters of Faith to follow their own judgment, and private interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Scripture: 2. What a miſery it is to make no uſe of the holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: 3 What madnes it is to take for the directours &amp; guides of their ſouls, men who can give no account of their lawfull Calling and Miſſion; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Letters Patents from ſome higher ſpiritual Superiour, bring one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their own bare word to prove what are.</p>

                  <head>The third Point.</head>
                  <p>Conſider now the rare excellency, and nature of the Church of Chriſt: this may be evidenced by 3 things moſt worthy to be remembred and medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon: <hi>The 1. whereof is the</hi> marks <hi>of it, which are rare endowments, privileges, &amp; proprieties, diſtinguiſhing it moſt clearly from all other ſects whatſoever; theſe marks are handled in the enſuing meditations: The 2. is the manifold &amp; admirable means &amp; helps, which it affords thoſe who are members of it, in order to their eaſie procuring their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſalvation, ten of theſe (moſt full of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort) are briefly handled in the ſecond point of the firſt Meditation.</hi>

                     </note> is the brave <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gium's,</hi> and great Characters, by which the holy Scriptures moſt deſervedly extoll it. This Church is ſtiled (and that by Truth it ſelf) the Kingdome of Chriſt; yea, the Kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: this is the body of Chriſt, and the Spouſe of that heavenly Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom: Chriſt cals this his Dove, his beloved, his perfect one, his onely one; this is his Vineyard, and his Harveſt: this is his Houſe: the Houſe of God, the Temple of God, the Tabernacle of God, and the City of God: This is a high Mount, the Mount of our Lord in the top of Mountains, mount <hi>Sion,</hi> and a holy Mountain: This for its Light is that Candle upon a Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick, fair as the Moon, choice as the Sun; that Woman cloathed with the Sun: this (for the means, and marks it hath) is a holy way, and ſo direct a way, that even fools ſhal not err there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: This for its ability to confute and conquer Hereſies, is, an Army ſet in battell ray: This for its infallibility, is a Pillar and Firmament; it is a Houſe built by the Wiſe man upon a
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:119650:23"/>Rock; in ſine, it is the Church of Chriſt, againſt which all the Forces of Hell ſhall never prevail: For which, <hi>O may thy name be ever glorified, O King of glory; and ſince thou art a Lord ſtrong, and powerfull, a Lord ſtrong in battaile;</hi> diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate thoſe Nations which will have Wars, <hi>wars againſt thy Church, thy City founded upon a rock, and ſituated upon a hill; or rather, ſince thy mercies are above all thy works, gather together (thou good Shepheard) theſe diſperſed, (if not loſt) ſheep, and reduce them back into the ſheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold of thy Church, Amen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Collect out of this point, Firſt, how great the ingratitude of thoſe is towards Chriſt, who derogate from the honour of his Church, either by laying falſe aſperſions upon it of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, defection, and teaching falſe doctrine; or at leaſt bear not that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and reverence towards it, which they ought, both in regard of its excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, and Chriſts charity in founding it. Secondly, how great reaſon there is, that every one, that is not a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of it, but of ſome other Sect (though they imagine themſelves to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:119650:24"/>be truly of the true Church) do not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding parallel their Sect with that Church, of which the Scriptures give ſuch noble characters: aſſuredly if paſſion, partiality, prejudicate opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and love of worldly things be laid aſide, reaſon will tell them, they are wrong: and ſince notwithſtanding ſome one (for there can be but one) of the different religions now on foot in Europe, muſt be it; (for Chriſt hath a true Church upon earth) the reſult of that deliberation will be, that the Roman Catholikes alone have it.</p>

                  <p>Conſider therefore that the end and intention, which Chriſt prefixed to himſelf, when he founded the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church, was the glory of God, and the ſalvation of Soules:
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:119650:24"/>Theſe two are like the two Poles; for all the created Univerſe move for them: theſe are that <hi>negotium ſeculo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> that work of ages; that <hi>primum</hi> or firſt and chiefeſt thing, which muſt be ſought for; that <hi>unum neceſſarium,</hi> for which all other things muſt be ſet aſide.</p>
                  <p>But conſider withall, that this Church is founded for the ſalvation of Mankinde, not ſo, as a thing indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, but as eſſentially requiſite, and out of which no ſalvation can be had; thus ſpeak the Fathers, thus the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and thus the Figures, which repreſent the Church: All that were not within the <hi>Ark</hi> of <hi>Noah,</hi> periſhed in the Deluge; the member, which is cut off from the <hi>body,</hi> cannot live, the branch which is not united to the <hi>Vine Tree</hi> can bring forth no fruit, muſt needs wither; is onely fit for the fire: the Sheep which remain not in this <hi>Sheepfold</hi> will be devoured by the hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Wolves. And none received that myſterious penny (the Symbol of eternall reward) but thoſe that laboured in the VINEYARD.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:119650:25"/>Its of infinite conſequence therefore, whether or no the Sect you are on, be the true Church, pray, read, meditate, conſerre, compare Sect with Sect, till you finde out the true Church: for (as truly ſaid Saint <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and Saint <hi>Auſtin) He ſhall not have God for his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who will not have the Church for his Mother;</hi> to wit, the true Church; Chriſt's Church.</p>

                  <head>The firſt Point.</head>
                  <p>COnſider firſt, what is meant by the Marks of the Church; a mark in general is that by which we know a thing, and are able to diſtinguiſh it from other things, by the direction of that mark: ſo the divine Wiſdome ſet certain marks upon his Church, by means of which it might be made no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious and eaſie to be found out, as alſo by the ſame means eaſily diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able from all other Sects whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>Conſider ſecondly, that the marks of the true Church muſt needs have one propriety, and that is clarity: They muſt be things (though they be rare and extraordinary) yet clear: known, apparent, and free from ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity and uncertainty in themſelves: and therefore they are called ſignes
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:119650:26"/>and notes; by reaſon of their facility of being obſerved and taken notice of; but if they be defective in this, they are no marks, but things as much ſubject to be queſtioned and controverted, as that very thing (to wit the Church, or its infallible authority) whoſe marks they are pretended to be: but mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, propheſies, and ſtrange converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Nations; alſo Unity, Sanctity, Univerſality, and Apoſtolical ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (which foure laſt are mentioned in the <hi>Nicen Creed:</hi>) theſe are plainly convincing arguments and marks, by which Chriſts Church may be found out, and diſtinguiſhed from all falſe Sects that have them not.</p>
                  <p>Hence inferre, that all modern Sects ſhew themſelves guilty of maintaining a bad cauſe; and that Chriſts true Church is not amongſt them; becauſe they aſſigne no ſuch marks as theſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove mentioned; but other obſcure things and points controverted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them and the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes: Such are lawfull adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacraments, and ſincere preaching of the Word of God, and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:119650:26"/>the like: theſe are no marks, but we muſt finde out where theſe are, by the forementioned marks: they make themſelves, by this, guilty alſo of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fault, which is called <hi>petitio prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipii,</hi> or begging the queſtion; by taking that for an argument in their own behalf, which very thing is the queſtion to be argued.

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:119650:27"/>which he made uſe of to the aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of both Nations; all being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced thereby, that he was a man of God: nor did God ſend any other of his Prophets upon any great deſigne, but he authorized them with the gift of miracles, prophecy, eminent ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity, or ſome one of them; by means of which, credit was given to their words, that they were the words of God, revealed to them.

                  <head>The fourth Point.</head>
                  <p>Conſider laſtly, ſome inferences, which may be drawn out of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent points: Firſt, thoſe that are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready members of the Catholike Church, have much to thank God for, in being made members of that Church, which is ſo very conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous with theſe rare endowments, and proprieties. Secondly, ſince theſe marks (here-briefly touched, but in the enſuing pages, more particularly to be looked into apart) are on the one ſide ſo neceſſary, and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo ſufficient, and ſatisfactory to reaſon: it behoves every Proteſtant, Presbyterian, Independent, Anaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſt, and all theſe late Euthuſiaſticks, to try the truth of their ſeverall Sects by theſe touchſtones. Thirdly, That he who makes a ſearch after the true Religion, by the direction of theſe marks, proceeds moſt prudently, and cannot be obnoxious to errour in his enquiry. Fourthly, that this is both the moſt convincing, and alſo the moſt
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:119650:30"/>eaſie way of compoſing all Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies: for by this you may eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the true Church; which being found out, all are obliged to embrace it, and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap>and to its verdict in all things: and the Scripture (whoſe obſcure texts abuſed, and variouſly interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, have given occaſion of theſe, and of all Hereſies) will by this means need no ſearching into. Laſtly,</p>
                  <p>For a preparation to the enſuing meditations, infer what dictamen, and diſpoſition a man is to come with, that will benefit his ſoul by reading them: Firſt, he muſt obſerve that there is a great difference betwixt Affirmative and Negative Propoſitions in this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: for it is evident, that that Sect or Religion is not the true Church, which is devoid of theſe marks: why? becauſe they are inſeparable from the true Church; as will hereafter ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear out of the firſt points of many of the Meditations. Yet on the contrary, you muſt not think, that whereſoever any of theſe marks is to be found, there is the true RELIGION:
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:119650:31"/>for God can give a man power to work miracles, or propheſie truly, though he be of a falſe Sect, but not in confirmation of that falſe Sect: So <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian the Apoſtate,</hi> going to ſacrifice to the heatheniſh Gods, and terrified with the ſudden apparition of the devill, he inſtantly drive him away by making the ſigne of the croſſe, which he had learned when he was a Catholike; thus writes St. <hi>Greg.

                  <p>Secondly, he muſt come with indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency; otherwiſe he cannot be an impartial and fit judge; without any prejudicate opinion, without paſſion, and without obſtinate reſolution of perſiſting where he is, be his Sect what it will be; for this were affected igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, which is malice; and ſuch an

                     <hi>Theſe ſignes</hi> (ſayes our Saviour of his Church) <hi>ſhall follow them that believe in me: in my name ſhall they caſt out Devils, they ſhall ſpeake with new tongues, they ſhall take up Serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it ſhall not hurt them; they ſhall lay hands on the ſick, and they ſhall recover:</hi> Here's the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of that power, and behold the performance of it: <hi>Matt.</hi> 16.20. <hi>They went forth and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming their word with ſignes following:</hi> And that this power of working Miracles was to remaine perpetually in the Church, it is acknowledged by the Proteſtants (in their Bible, Printed
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:119650:32"/>
                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1576.) in their Comment in the Margent upon theſe words of S. <hi>John,

                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:119650:33"/>
                  <p>Firſt, The Authours who relate them, or wrote in defence of them, or urge them as an argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Heathens and Hereticks: Such are St. <hi>Ireneus,</hi>

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:119650:37"/>done by the Roman Catholikes, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have none themſelves: and by good conſequence they have not the true Church amongſt them; ſince they have not this mark, which the Scripture attributes to Chriſts Church: Secondly, that the above mentioned holy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were all Roman Catholicks, even for this very reaſon(if there were

                  <head>The ſecond Point.</head>
                  <p>To underſtand how truly true San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity and perfection hath been taken to heart alwayes amongſt Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, Conſider theſe <hi>three things</hi> following; Firſt, the means their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion affords them, for the acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of true Sanctity; Secondly, The uſe they make of ſuch means: Thirdly, The number and multitude of their Saints. Conſider therefore, 1. That all the helps and requiſites, which the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of perfection can ſtand in need of, are to be had amongſt them; to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the benefits of divine grace and juſtification, as alſo to increaſe the ſame, and to recover them again be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loſt, As 1. The holy <hi>Sacraments</hi> are the main means; now, who makes any doubt, but that the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks make moſt frequent and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious uſe of theſe; but eſpecially the holy SACRAMENT of the ALTAR,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:119650:39"/>and that of Confeſſion (which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes accompanied with the exerciſe of many Acts of other vertues, as hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, ſorrow, good purpoſes, victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry over ones ſelf, Faith, Hope and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity) they find by daily experience to be great helps to vertue.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Their form of worſhip, and that divine Sacrifice of holy <hi>Maſſe</hi> (which all antiquity ever honoured) is both a motive to all acts of vertue, a means to obtain vertue, and a work upon which all vertues attend: it is both impretatory and propitiatory in the higheſt degree.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Another great furtherer, &amp; moſt efficacious means to vertue, is <hi>Prayer,</hi> both mentall and vocall; to the good and frequent performance of which, as the Roman Catholicks are moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the Counſell of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, by being moſt addicted to it of all other ſorts of people; ſo have they moſt excellent inſtructions given them by holy and learned men.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Faſting,</hi> (ſo much commended, and extolled by holy ſcripture in the lovers of it) how can it but be very
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:119650:39"/>conducing to vertue; ſince it weakens vertues adverſaries (the rebellion of the Fleſh, inordinate paſſions, and the malignant humours both of body and ſoul) ſo much, as experience teaches, the Roman Catholicks ſurpaſſe all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in this.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Another great advantage they have above all others, and that is the direction of their ſpiritual Paſtors, and <hi>Ghoſtly Fathers;</hi> upon, whom as there is a moſt ſtrict charge laid, that they have care of their ſpirituall chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſo they diſcharge that duty moſt exactly.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The <hi>Doctrine</hi> they teach (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally that of good Works, Works of Supererogation, Penance, and Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction) is a great ſpurre and mover to perfection.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. To omit other inſtrumental cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of vertue and devotion, that admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and plainly divine invention, and inſtitution of <hi>Religious Orders</hi> (dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering one from another in their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of living, but moſt unanimous in beliving) is plainly an admirable means to get vertue by; yea, that ſtate of life
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:119650:40"/>is properly the ſchoole of perfection it ſelf; and by theſe you ſee how abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly the Roman Catholicks are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with means for attaining to ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity: to theſe alſo may be added other particular helps, mentioned in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond point of the firſt Meditation.</p>
                  <p>Conſider ſecondly, how Catholicks correſpond with theſe great helps they have for the expulſion of Vice, and purchaſe of Vertue: The Church commands each one thats come to the years of diſcretion, to approach once a year to the holy Communion, but commends a more frequent acceſſe: What do they do? hundreds in every great Town, yea, thouſands in ſome, repaire not once a year, but once every week to that divine banquet: they are commanded to confeſſe their ſins to the Prieſts (whoſe power to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give ſins was moſt aſſuredly given by Chriſt, in theſe expreſſe and clear words,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Jo.</hi> 20.23. <hi>Mat</hi> 18, 18,</note> 
                     <hi>Whoſe ſoever ſins ye remit, are remitted unto them.</hi>) Once a year: yet thouſands of them go to that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment once every week: They are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be preſent at holy Maſſe
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:119650:40"/>every Sunday and Holyday; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe dayes, thouſands of them in every great Town perform that act of Religion every day; is not this a true compliance with the forementio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned means? Are not theſe works of Supererogation a fair way to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Theſe inſtances alone, argue how much theſe people are addicted to prayer, what good they get by their ſpirituall directors, and how they fulfill that doctrine of good Works; As for Faſting (that ſoveraigne anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote againſt the ſins of the Fleſh) Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholicks are admired by all Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries for this; as for upright deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in civill contracts; they have the repute of being generally the left in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious or unjuſt: nor does any ſort of peoples word go further than theirs, even in treating with thoſe who are averſe from their opinions: And truly to ſee ſo many of them (families of great worth) in this our Nation, live ſo contentedly amongſt the ruines of their great Fortunes, which they might have kept intire in great part by once going with
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:119650:41"/>thoſe of a different Religion to Church, or ſwallowing over that one Oath, yet would not; this muſt needs argue a great fidelity to their religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Principles, and a great eſteem of vertue and piety in them; as for theſe holy inhabitants of religious Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, they live as if they would win heaven (which <hi>ſuffers force</hi>) even by ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry violence; ſuch is their ſtudy of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſection, ſo intenſe their prayers, ſo protracted their faſtings, ſo long their watchings, &amp; ſo continual their ſtudy of ſelf denial, carrying their croſſes, and following their Saviour (the things ſo much recommended by him to all) by an exact imitation of heroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call vertues. Who now can deny but the Roman Catholicks take to heart the ſtudy of perfection, and that <hi>ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Saints,</hi> which is ſanctity. Compare theſe and Sectaries together, and ſee what ſequels follow.</p>
                  <p>Conſider thirdly, the number of their Saints: behold a ſhort Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of ſome few of them in every Age, beſides the Apoſtles, Diſciples, and others, theſe following lived in the

<note place="margin">Note.</note> and ſalvation: in fine, all the means they pretend to get ſanctity by, is faith alone: this <hi>medium</hi> of faith, the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholicks have; and beſides it, all the other comfortable helps menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned before: Who can now but be afraid of the ones condition, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the other.</p>
                  <p>Conſider ſecondly, what Saints they have; they will not now ſurely own that Calender of <hi>John</hi> for any more; ſince Father <hi>Parſons</hi> examination proves it a ridiculous falſe thing; the chief of their forefathers were <hi>Luther,</hi>

Did he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe it? Did he become a Saint? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold what he did; he caſheer'd Faſting, Prayer, Watching, his Vows, his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery and the Pope; and inſtead of theſe took a Nun (called <hi>Catherine Bore</hi>) for his Concubine; and gave himſelf wholly to Luſt, Gluttony, drinking of Wine, and ſenſuality: What he writ, was conformable to the temper, which theſe Vices put him in to; and ſo he perſiſted to his dying day. <hi>Calvin</hi> was not onely given to

                  <p>To underſtand how agreeable to Piety, and Verity, the doctrine of the Roman Catholicks is, take theſe <hi>three conſiderations</hi> for matter of the frequent meditation: The firſt, is, That tenents of the Roman Catholicks (about thoſe matters, which are controverted betwixt them and other Sectaries) are more beſeeming Almighty God and his Church; much more advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the honour of both; and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter expreſſions of divine perfections, than the adverſary opinions are: Is it not better to have more means for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining divine grace (and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more Sacraments, the inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall cauſes of it) than fewer? to receive the real body &amp; blood of Chriſt, is not that a more noble memorial of Chriſts
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:119650:47"/>a thing more beneficiall to man, and more honourable to God, than a bit of Bread onely, and a ſup of Wine? Is it not farre more beneficial for frail and ſinfull men, that Chriſt give Prieſts power to remit, and forgive them their ſins, than otherwiſe? that the Church of Chriſt be conſpicuous and viſible in all Ages; that it be liable to no defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, or fallibility; that it have eaſie and acceſſible means for the deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Controverſies; that ſome ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and majeſticall form of worſhip be exhibited to the divine Majeſty; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that a ſacrifice of ſome rare thing (ſuch as is the precious body &amp; blood of Chriſt) be offered daily to that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite deity; that there be an Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Hierarchy, aſcending by different degrees up, till it come to one ſupream head, to whom all are to yeeld obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: do not theſe make more for the Churches perfection, Gods honour and glory, than the contrary? Frame to thy ſelf a lively <hi>Idea</hi> of the congrui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of theſe particulars with Gods and his Churches greater honour; look upon theſe inſtances with a judicious

<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Note.</hi>
                     </note> whether the affirmative or negative opinion were truer in theſe points; yet ſince one of the two muſt be embraced, chooſe that which is moſt conducing to the honour of God and his Church.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond conſideration is, that the opinions of the Roman Catholicks (theſe in particular now urged, and others which will be mentioned here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after) are more ſuitable and conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the holy ſcriptures, than their contradictories are: For the better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of which, obſerve theſe two <hi>rules,</hi> whereof the firſt is, clear places of ſcripture muſt be preferred in point of proof before hard and obſcure ones: the other is, many texts of Scripture muſt be a greater argument than fewer, <hi>caeteris paribus:</hi> theſe two rules can be rejected by none, but ſuch as (conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of their own unjuſt plea) will come to no try all at all: Now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formably to theſe rules, it is apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evident, that Roman Catholicks bring more and clearer places out of the ſcriptures, to eſtabliſh the truth
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:119650:48"/>of the forementioned opinions, and others which they hold, than their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries can poſſibly bring to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: Read any Catholick book of Controverſie, and you will ſee the truth of what is here affirmed; and by the way note alſo how this conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſtrengthens and fortifies the truth of the former.</p>
                  <p>The third conſideration is, that the tenents of Roman Catholicks are more conducing to the ſecurity of mens ſalvation, than the Negative opinions are: in this corruption of humane nature (vitiated by that Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal ſin of our protoparent <hi>Adam</hi>) the fleſh wages war continually againſt the ſpirit, and the inferiour againſt the ſuperiour portion of the ſoul; and the iſſue of the war would be the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing of the nobler part, unleſſe it had continuall recruits and ſupplyes, both of auxiliary forces from heaven, and made uſe alſo of Faſting, Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſelf-denial, and other aſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and mortifications: for theſe are the ordinary arms, with which the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious paſſions &amp; vicious inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:119650:48"/>muſt be curb'd; theſe are the things ſo much recomended in the ſcriptures both Propheticall and Apoſtolicall; theſe are the things recommended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us all by Chriſt himſelf, when he bid us <hi>deny our ſelves, take up our croſſes &amp; follow him;</hi>

                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 24</note> as alſo when he bid us go in the <hi>narrow way,</hi> and enter in at the <hi>ſtrait gate:</hi> Now this is the very do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Roman Catholicks, and only of them: They both in their Pulpits, and with their pennes inculcate theſe vertues continually; witneſſe the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny rare Treatiſes written by their Prieſts upon that ſubject; as alſo of the angelical vertue Chaſtity; and of the Sacrament of Confeſſion, which is accompanied with the exerciſe of moſt virtuous acts of Contrition, Penance purpoſes of emendation, of ſatisfying for injuries done, and removing the occaſions of relapſes; all which vertues, as they are contrary to ſelf-eaſe, &amp; the wild liberty of fleſh and blood, ſo they keep off ſin, &amp; ſecure ſalvation ſo much the more: and thus you ſee how their doctrine teaches to <hi>decline from evill</hi> by the aforeſaid means; &amp; as for <hi>doing good,</hi>
                     <pb n="80" facs="tcp:119650:49"/>which is the ſecond part of the works of Chriſtian duty; it is moſt certain that their doctrine favours this, and leads to this moſt effectually; for they teach that the commandements of God may be kept, and that the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of obſerving them is not inſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; They teach, that man hath a free liberty of will, not onely to doe evill, but good alſo: They teach that mans works (done in vertue of Chriſts merits, and united with them) may be good and meritory of an increaſe of grace and glory: Theſe opinions can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but animate a man towards the keeping of divine precepts, and doing all the good he can; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bring a greater ſecurity of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <hi>Which if thou takeſt to heart truly, thou muſt like, love and embrace this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</hi>

                  <p>Conſider now, whether or no, the doctrine of other Sectaries (now ſwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in <hi>England</hi>) be holy and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome; and how helpfull it is to the ſaving of ſoules: this will appear
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:119650:49"/>by a ſhort ſurvey made of thoſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, which are commonly held by them all: firſt, behold what a pitiful, poor, and naked thing they make <hi>the Church of Chriſt:</hi> (by w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> Church is here meant, not this or that Church, which either Roman Catholicks, or other Sects call Chriſts Church and theirs; but preſcinding from controverſie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout whoſe, or where it is; we mean the Church of Chriſt <hi>ſecundum ſe;</hi> and which all Sects muſt grant Chriſt hath upon earth:) this they deveſt of all the ornaments, which become it, and the founder of it.

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:119650:50"/>is ſo great an act of Religion as it is, by depriving the Church of Chriſt of this, they undervalue the Church, and monarchicall government (which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> a heathen could define to be the beſt for keeping of order) they deny Chriſts Church: a man would think that God (who does all things in <hi>number, weight, and meaſure</hi>) ſhould have made the Church a maſter-piece of his wiſdome, power, and goodneſſe: the Roman Catholicks indeed ſay it is ſo; but other Sectaries deprive it not of comely ornaments onely, but even requiſites; and have leſt in it nothing but one Sacrament, to wit, baptiſme (for their other things is but bare Bread and Wine) and that now omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and abuſed by many; no form of Worſhip, but ſome one of their ill tranſlated Pſalms, and that not uſed by all; and Preaching, common to all ſorts (and even Sexes) of People.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they teach things which are plainly paradoxical, and aſyſtata; things not onely repugnant to moſt clear texts of Scripture, but quite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive of good Works, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:119650:50"/>of the means for ſalvation: for by their <hi>private ſpirit,</hi> and each mans own interpretation of ſcripture, they meaſure and ſquare out the whole bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines of Faith and Religion: in this if they erre (and how can they be free from errours?) they not onely run hazard of but plainly incur damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for he that will not believe ſhall be condemned. <hi>Amay with this pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and preſumptuous tenent, let the Church be your guide; hear Her, Shee's expoſed to no illuſions of ſelf-conceipt, or of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſpirits, whoſe transfiguring themſelves into angels of light ſhe can diſcover, you cannot.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They deny alſo that man can <hi>merit</hi> by his good Works; a tenent evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrary to all places of ſcripture in which the word <hi>reward</hi> is extant: for merit and reward are correlatives; they inferre one another: to ſay that Chriſt, amongſt the other things he me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited, merited alſo this, that mans good works (done in relation to hi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Many of them hold that the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements</hi> of God cannot poſſibly be kept, O blaſphemy! <hi>Whats this, but to impeach the divine Majeſty of tyranny:</hi>

                  <p>And to omlt other their aſſertions diſhonourable to Chriſtian Religion, they hold that an act of Faith alone, works that great work of <hi>mans juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation:</hi> that great change (which the Prophet <hi>David</hi> cals the work of the <hi>right hand of him that is on high</hi>) of a ſoul transferred from the ſtate of being found guilty of mortal fin,

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:119650:52"/>or ſanctification; it is indeed a diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, but ſo is fear, penance, hopes and an act of the love of God; by which act the ſoul is much more uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to God, than by an act of Faith: of mans juſtification therefore, the effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cauſe is God, the formall cauſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace, and the meritory cauſe is Chriſt; to wit, by his merits and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The bad ſequels are many which that opinion of faith alone juſtifying brings: firſt, it hinders the exerciſe of many other vertues, much recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded unto us in the holy Scripture; as filiall fear offending God, ſorrow for having offended him, and good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of amendment: ſecondly, it is a great let and impediment to good Works, and the ſtudy of vertue: for if I can be ſatisfied and conſequently ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, by producing one act of Faith on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; what need is there of ſpending my time, and taking pains to pray, faſt, watch, do penance, give alms?

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:119650:53"/>Chriſtian duty, (<hi>decline from evil</hi> and <hi>do good</hi>) and preſcribes the means: the other gives occaſion to ſinne freely, and puts a barre againſt vertue: the one hath a pleaſant taſte at firſt, and ſeemingly relliſheth well, but in the operation proves rank poyſon to the ſoul: the other ſeems harſh, and hath ſomewhat of the bitter in it, but in effect it proves a true cordiall; the teachers of the one are thoſe (of whom our Saviour bids us beware) <hi>that come in the ſheeps cloathing</hi> of ſoft indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and condeſcending Doctrine, but the effects of it proves them to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriourly <hi>ravenous wolves;</hi> the others are like good ſhepherds; who reſtrain, yet feed their ſheep, and govern them well.

                  <p>Conſider now the efficacy of the Roman Catholick doctrine. And firſt a <hi>priori,</hi> as from the cauſe. Mans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellective faculty aimes at truth, and ſeeks to perfect it ſelfe in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof, as being it's naturall object; and for the rationall appetite, the will, good is that which it hunts after. Now certaine it is that the Church of Rome teacheth the moſt noble, and ſublime things, that can be ſtudyed or conceived. Such are the nature of the Divine effence, and its perfections; the eternall beatitude of man, and the moſt comfortable, and efficacious means to obtaine it, and how to remove the letts and impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the purchaſe of it. Add to theſe the excellency of Chriſts Church, and its holy Sacraments and Sacrifice, together with the doctrine contained in the Second point of the former me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation.

                  <p>COnſider firſt, that as Chriſt our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour founded the Catholick Church, ſo as that it ſhould laſt to the end of the world; ſo alſo he ordained, that in it there ſhould be lawfull Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, ſucceeding one another, ſo long as the Church was to continue; this the ſcripture teacheth in expreſſe terms:

                  <p>Conſider thirdly, the manner of this legall Calling, which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes muſt be from God, as <hi>Aaron</hi> was; divine calling, or vocation, is twofold, <hi>extraordinary,</hi> and <hi>ordinary:</hi> the former is, when God by himſelf immediately cals one, as he did the Prophets, <hi>Moſes</hi> and the reſt: and this extraordinary manner of calling was abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in the firſt plantation of the Church: For the firſt Paſtors, (to wit the Apoſtles) could not be called o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe; becauſe they were the very firſt themſelves. The Ordinary cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is alſo from God; but not done by him immediatly, but by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currance of others: The firſt, of the line of thoſe which were ordinarily called, was called after the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary manner, by God immediately; ſo was <hi>Aaron</hi> called; but <hi>Aarons</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors were ordained by others: ſo the Apoſtles (who were called extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily)
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:119650:63"/>ordained other Biſhops and Prieſts; and theſe Biſhops after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards made others, according to the order preſcribed by Chriſt, to be held in his Church; and thus both voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were truly from God.</p>
                  <p>Now to underſtand the better what the lawfull calling of a true Biſhop or Prieſt is; and by this means, to be able the better to diſtinguiſh who are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Paſtors, and who not: Conſider, theſe things; firſt, the <hi>Election,</hi> or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation of the Perſon, and this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs properly to Church men; though the People, or ſecular Princes, have been ſometimes permitted to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, and propoſe to the Church ſuch perſons as they deſired &amp; thought ſit; but this makes not a man either Biſhop or Prieſt: the next thing after Election or Approbation, is <hi>Conſecration,</hi> or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination; and this act is to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med onely by Biſhops: this act is it which makes a true Biſhop or Prieſt; and without this conſecration, all the Princes of the world, by any their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of perſons to Epiſcopall, or Prieſtly Function, can never make
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:119650:64"/>them true Biſhops or Prieſts. The third thing is <hi>Juriſdiction,</hi> which is given by a Superiour Prelate to the Conſecrated perſon, and this is called Miſſion; for he is ſent with faculties to govern ſouls, and feed them with the holy Sacraments, and the word of God. Theſe faculties (for ſo they are called) are the Prieſts Commiſſion; and the giving of them with leſſer, or greater limits, as alſo the aſſigning him theſe ſubjects in particular, and not others, is only in the hands of Spiritual Prelats, and in no tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Princes power whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>Gather out of the premiſſes; Firſt, that that Church cannot poſſibly be Chriſts Church which wants Biſhops: Secondly that theſe are only true Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and Prieſts; who are lawfully deſcended from the Apoſtles: Thirdly that thoſe only are legally deſcended from the Apoſtles, who have theſe two things, Succeſſion, and Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; both Apoſtolicke. A true Paſtor muſt ſucceed to ſome one of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, ether immediatly, as Saint <hi>Liuus</hi> ſucceeded Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and as Saint
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:119650:64"/>
                     <hi>Policarpe</hi> ſucceeded Saint <hi>John:</hi> or elſe mediatly, as S. <hi>Ignatius</hi> ſucceeded S. <hi>Evodius,</hi> who was ordained Biſhop by S. <hi>Peter:</hi> his Conſecration alſo muſt be Apoſto lick; that is, this Prieſt muſt be conſecrated by a Biſhop, which Biſhop muſt be conſecrated by other Biſhops, and theſe by others, till at length an aſſent by degrees be made up to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles. Fourthly, that Spiritual dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is of a far higher nature than tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, both by reaſon of its lineal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent (and that never interrupted) from Chriſt; as alſo by reaſon of its Function, which is about things Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and Divine.</p>

                  <head>The ſecond Point.</head>
                  <p>To under ſtand how lawfully the paſtors of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; Conſider firſt that the Proteſtants doe not ſtand in denial of this, but plainly grant it: yea they pretend for the lawfulnes of their own calling no greater argument then that they have their ſucceſſion from the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> conſcious, to wit, that there can be no true power, either of order, or Juriſdiction, nor any true legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlative power Eccleſiaſticall at all,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:119650:65"/>but it muſt deſcend by ſucceſſion from Chriſt, and his Apoſtles; and this they acknowledge the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to have; pretending with all that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are united to the ſame line of Communication in that Apoſtolick ſucceſſion.</p>
                  <p>Conſider ſecondly, this their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full calling confirmed by this Negative Argument: Chriſt muſt have, and hath a Viſible Church upon earth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where; this Church muſt have a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſucceſſion of Paſtors; for this is the main thing in which chiefly the viſibility of the Church appears; ſince where the ſucceſſion of Paſtors ceaſeth, there the flock is leſt ungoverned, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed, expoſed to diſperſion and periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and thus the Church would come to faile, not onely in viſibility, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in its exiſtency: Now this Viſible ſucceſſion muſt be derived from the Apoſtles, and that without ever being interrupted; otherwiſe the Church would not be Apoſtolick, (contrary to the ſcripture, and the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed) nor remain the ſame unto the end of the world; contrary to our Saviours
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:119650:65"/>promiſe, and St. <hi>Pauls</hi> forementioned words: And ſince there is not any ſect which either doth or can with any ſhew of probability pretend to have a See Apoſtolick, or a never interrupted viſible ſucceſſion from the Apoſtles, but onely in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> there it muſt be, and conſequently their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling(yea only theirs) lawfull: True it is, the <hi>Greek</hi> Church had Apoſtolick Sees; to wit, at <hi>Hieruſalem, Antioch,</hi> and <hi>Alexandria;</hi> each of which had an Apoſtle or Evangeliſt, for its firſt Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop: but for the ſpace of theſe laſt nine hundred years (ſince the begining of which time, the <hi>Perſians, Sarazens</hi> and <hi>Turks</hi> have kept poſſeſſion of thoſe Countries) the ſucceſſion in theſe hath been obſcure, interrupted, as good as none: And this by the juſt judgement of God, for the Schiſme and perſidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church; as alſo to make the <hi>Roman</hi> See Apoſtolick, more clearly to appear to be the Mother and Miſtreſſ of all Churches.</p>
                  <p>Conſider thirdly, that the lawfull Calling of Paſtors amongſt the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks is, further poſitively de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrable
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:119650:66"/>from the ſucceſſion of their Popes. For the better underſtanding of which, note firſt, That the ancient Fathers were moſt exact in regiſtering the names of the Popes, as they ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded one another; ſo did Saint <hi>Ireneus, Tertullian, Euſebius,</hi> S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> S. <hi>Hierom</hi> and others; the like diligence hath been uſed by other <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks in all ſucceeding ages, even to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Popes dayes, who is called <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi> the 10. and is the two hundred thirty and nine from S. <hi>Peter.</hi> Note ſecondly, that the forementioned holy Fathers, uſed to produce the ſucceſſion of Popes, as an impregnable argument to prove that to be the onely true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which had theſe chief Paſtors on its ſide: Now if the ſucceſſion of twenty or thirty of them, were of ſuch force(in the judgment of theſe learned Doctors) to convince Hereticks; how forcible an argument againſt theſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Sects, muſt a long Catalogue of 239 make. Note thirdly, that none were ever acknowledged by the <hi>Roman</hi> church for true and lawfull Biſhops or Prieſts, but ſuch as were ordained
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:119650:66"/>either immediately by the Apoſtles, or by their ſucceſſors; now conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blely to theſe truths, here noted; this follows, and is moſt certain, that from every true Pri<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

This orderly ſeries or ſcale of ſucceſſion proves evidently the Paſtors of the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion to be lawfully called and ſent. <hi>Here's ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity, heres ſecurity; thoſe that will get out of their labyrinths of errours, doubts, or fears, muſt do it by the conduct of this line: begin, go on; this is your way to the Apoſtles and Chriſt.</hi>

                  <head>The third Point.</head>
                  <p>Conſider now, how the caſe ſtands with other Sects, in point of lawfull calling; and firſt for <hi>Luther,</hi> the ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leader of all modern ſects; that his calling was not extraordinary, it is certain; for he could never ſhew his extraordinary Commiſſion, to wit, Miracles, the giſt of Prophecy, or theſe
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:119650:67"/>other ſupernatuall endowments, which God alwayes gave to his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles, whom he ſent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily; and that this exacting of Miracles in this caſe is moſt juſt and reaſonable; it is hence proved, if ſome new upſtart ſhould pretend he were immediately ſent by God to preach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch or ſuch a Sect; the onely means that Sect could uſe for ſilencing and confuting ſuch an one, were to demand Miracles of him: and if ſome new impoſtor ſhould pretend he were Chriſt; or urge his being ſent extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily to Preach againſt Chriſt, or any other myſtery of Faith, which were believed by all Chriſtians (as the myſtery of the Incarnation, or Paſſion, the reality of ſupernatural Faith, and divine grace, or the like) againſt ſuch a fictitious pretender, not onely <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Catholicks, but all other Sects a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Chriſtians, alſo ought to bid him ſhew his Commiſſion ſealed with Miracles.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Luthers ordinary calling;</hi> true it is, he was lawfully ordained Prieſt by the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> but a Prieſt
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:119650:67"/>cannot ordain other Prieſts, much leſſe Biſhops: ſo that no ſucceſſion could be propagated by him: It is true alſo, that he had juriſdiction (which muſt flow from the ſpring head of all true eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction, Chriſt and his Vicar; and was lawfully ſent (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his being conſecrated) to govern and ſeed ſouls: but his faculties, or commiſſion were given him with theſe limits and conditions, which not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Eccleſiaſtical Prelat, but even ſenſe and reaſon requires; to wit, that he ſhould uſe that power <hi>for the edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and not to the deſtruction</hi> of that Church which gave him it; that he ſhould Preach and Teach her doctrine, that he ſhould adminiſter her Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but he went beyond his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, yea, quite contrary to it; he preached doctrine contradictory to that of the Church; he taught her do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine was falſe in many of the maineſt points, and that her Sacraments were not ſo many, and ſo efficacious cauſes of grace, as they were; he could have no commiſſion for this: yea, his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt and rebellion againſt the Church
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:119650:68"/>quite annull'd his former Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and deveſted him of all the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which had been delegated former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to him: as for <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> though ſome of his clients ſtiled him Biſhop of <hi>Wittenberg,</hi> (as <hi>Oecolampadius,</hi> whoſe Grave ſtone expreſſeth him the firſt Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Baſil,</hi> and <hi>Zuinglius</hi> of <hi>Tigur,</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> of <hi>Geneva</hi>) yet neither he, nor theſe other ever gave out, or pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they had Epiſeopall Conſecration, or juriſdiction from the <hi>Roman</hi> Church or from any precedent Biſhops: ſo that what they acted in this kinde was by a uſurped power and invalid.</p>
                  <p>Conſider ſecondly, <hi>the calling of the Engliſh Miniſtry;</hi> the Proteſtant titular Biſhops urged alwayes againſt their Catholick Antagoniſts, that they were true Biſhops: their proof was becauſe they were conſecrated by the old Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Biſhops: <hi>Mark here (for your comfort) Catholicks; that your Biſhops, and by conſequence your Prieſts, are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged for true and lawfull, even by their adverſaries:</hi> But you (Proteſtants) mark in order to your amendment, that this very means (and the onely
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:119650:68"/>argument, by which they muſt prove, themſelves lawful Biſhops) which they make uſe of to eſtabliſh your cauſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys it; and with all confirms that the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, are the onely true Church: For ſince that main thing which Chriſt gave his Church, (to wit, power to ordain Biſhops and Prieſts, and to ſend them to ſeed ſouls with the word of God, and the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) is granted to be in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> it follows evidently, that it is the true Church of Chriſt; and that its doctrine and Sacraments are onely true: for Chriſt could not give that Church commiſſion to Preach doctrin contrary to his; nor could the Church (which confeſſedly hath this power) ordain others, and give them commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to Preach againſt it ſelf: Hence alſo it followeth (if theſe ſuppoſed Proteſtant Biſhops were ordained by the old Catholick ones) by going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their commiſſion, and preaching and acting againſt that Church, which gave them their power; firſt, that their former true commiſſion ceaſed, and was annulled: Secondly, that Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:119650:69"/>and their Biſhops were, and ſtill are guilty of Schiſme, by not holding communion with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and thirdly, that they are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of hereſie (theſe Biſhops and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, to wit) in believing and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Doctrine contrary to the Roman Church, which they ſay, gave them their power. Fourthly, that they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred the Eccleſiaſticall cenſures, for the forementioned reaſons, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, could not give orders law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully; ſo that their Succeſſors were not lawfully ordained. Fifthly, that ſince the Proteſtant Biſhops, neither uſed the true form, nor matter, in the conſecration of their later Biſhops and Miniſters, with which the firſt of them was ſuppoſed to have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated with, by the old Catholick Biſhops, even upon this ſcore, the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter were no true Biſhops nor Prieſts. Sixthly, that ſince none can lawfully ſucceed in a Biſhoprick, unleſſe the former Biſhop be either dead, or cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nically depoſed; even upon this ground all the firſt of the Proteſtant Prelates were unlawfull; becauſe the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:119650:69"/>old Biſhops were living and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, when the later uſurped their Sees, or were intruded by others.</p>
                  <p>But the truth is, theſe firſt Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants took to themſelves that Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical honour,

                  <head>The firſt Point.</head>
                  <p>Conſider firſt, that antiquity is a mark of Chriſts Church: this is moſt clear out of ſcripture, all thoſe places in which the indefectibility and infallibility of the Church is foretold, promiſed or intimated; prove alſo the Antiquity of it: <hi>And I will make this my covenant, ſaith the Lord my ſpirit, that is upon thee,

                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat. 28.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>I am with you all the dayes, even untill the conſummation of the world;</hi> moſt expreſſe words of our Saviour, who alſo ſaid, <hi>That after the ſower had ſown</hi> good ſeed, <hi>then came the enemy and ſowed</hi> cockle <hi>upon it:</hi>

                        <hi>Mat. 13.</hi>
                     </note> the good ſeed of Catholick doctrine was firſt ſowen by Chriſt, and afterwards the devill ſowed the cockle of falſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and hereſie upon it.</p>
                  <p>Confider ſecondly, the antiquity of Chriſts Church, gathered from other reaſon: And firſt its very names im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port thus much, it is called the Church of Chriſt; becauſe he founded it when in mortall fleſh he converſed with men; and therefore it would imply a contradiction to grant it to be Chriſts Church, and yet deny it antiquity: it is alſo called Catholick, not onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it imbraceth all places, but all times alſo; and it is called Apoſtolick,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:119650:73"/>becauſe it begun in the Apoſtles, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains their doctrine, and keeps their ſucceſſion. 2. Reaſon, dictates to all, that truth is precedent in time to falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, which is nothing elſe but a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyall of truth; and conſequently po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriour in time to it; for the Father of lyes brought falſhood into the world, when he tempted our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, after their creation in the ſtate of Grace and Knowledge of Truth, 3. The holy Fathers alwayes urged this mark of the antiquity of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church,
<note place="margin">Lib. cont. cp. fund. cap. 4.</note> againſt the Novelliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of the Hereticks, and their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming after that the Church of Chriſt was begun: ſo did Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> urge this mark againſt the Manicheans; and Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>Pamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence infer, firſt, that that Sect can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſible be, yea or conceived to be Chriſts true Church, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> begun in ſuch or ſuch a year after that Chriſts Church was inſtituted: Why? becauſe this poſteriority of times argues diverſity, which excludes identity. Secondly, that that ſect cannot poſſibly be the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:119650:73"/>true Church of Chriſt, which (though it began in Chriſts, or his Apoſtles time) yet hath not continued, but is now annihilated, and why? becauſe its antiquity (which muſt not onely be derived from Chriſts time, but the ſame muſt alſo be, without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption continued, till the worlds end) is come to an end, Chriſts Church having ſtill its being.</p>

                  <p>Conſider now the Antiquity of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> by which Church is underſtood, not onely that Congregation of the faithfull, which in the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the adjacent places, adhere to that Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Biſhop; but all others alſo, diſperſed, over all the earth, that are united to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> by the ſame belief, by communion in the ſame Sacraments, and by obedience to the ſame Supream head under Chriſt: the Antiquity therefore of this Church, is firſt demonſtrated out of the Scripture it ſelf. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> writ that famous Epiſtle of his, to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in which he gives
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:119650:74"/>the members thereof many great Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giums:

                  <p>Conſider now, what may be drawn out of all the precedent points: firſt, that antiquity is not onely a mark of the true Church; but it is one by which even the moſt ignorant ſoules may eaſily finde out, which is the true Church; and which are late ſects, and conſequently falſe; for a ſmal enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry will bring them to the knowledge of which Religion is of the longeſt ſtanding, and a far leſſe will diſcover unto them which are of the lateſt; for of <hi>Luther,</hi> above mention is made: <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> begun at <hi>Geneva, anno</hi> 1538. and Proteſtant Religion in <hi>England</hi> begun under Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> (though ſome ſymptoms of falling into it, were dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in her predeceſſor <hi>Edward</hi> the

                  <p>Conſider firſt, that the true Church of Chriſt is but one: The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Councels, Fathers, Hiſtory, and Reaſon, prove this truth; imprint in thy minde the many divine Oracles, with which the true God of Wiſdome hath confirmed this: <hi>One is my Dove, my perfect one;</hi> Cant. 6. <hi>One God, one Faith, one Baptiſme, one body, one ſpirit;</hi> ſayes Saint <hi>Paul, Epheſ.</hi> 4. who alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends to all Chriſtians moſt earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtly, that they will <hi>ſtand faſt in one ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, with one minde:</hi> Phil. 1.27. and that they will be <hi>like minded, having the ſame love, being of one accord, and one minde:</hi> Phil. 2.2. in all which places, and many more, he exhorts to unity in Faith, Judgment, and opinion: Our Saviour every where ſpeaks of his Church in the ſingular number; (<hi>tell the Church, upon this rock will
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:119650:81"/>I build my Church!</hi>) intimating thereby, it is but one: the General Councell of <hi>Nice</hi> and <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> (received by Proteſtants) define, and profeſſe in their Creed, that the Catholick Church is but one; the holy Fathers all una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly fight for the unity of Chriſts Church againſt Hereticks and ſchiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks; and Hiſtory delivers unto poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, the continued ſucceſſion of Popes Biſhops, Prieſts, Doctours, Confeſſors, Virgins and Martyrs, for fifteen cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies of years together and more; all whoſe lives, deaths, books and blood, have publiſhed, ſigned and ſealed their atteſtations, that there is but one Church, the Roman Church, which is the Catholick Church.</p>
                  <p>Conſider ſecondly, and that ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what forces natural reaſon brings to eſtabliſh this Unity; verity it ſelf is but one, and that indiviſible; and propoſitions contradictory cannot poſſibly be both true: how then can Sects, or Religions contradicting one another in one and the ſelf ſame points, be more than one of them true? Different Nations, people of different
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:119650:81"/>callings and qualities, may meet in conjunction together, and make one and the ſame body in Faith, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; as it happened in the Primitive Church: But different Sects, and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of a contrary beliefe about the ſelf ſame material objects, or points of Faith (for example about the real pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Chriſts body in the Euchariſt about Juſtification, about Purgatory, about the infallible Authority of the Church and ſuch like) cannot poſſible be both true, whileſt they remain both contradictory: for that would deſtroy that Principle which naturall Reaſon dictates to all men, which is, that <hi>the ſame thing cannot be and not be at the ſame time:</hi> the ſame point can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be true and falſe; nor the Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and Affirmative opinion about the ſame point both true and falſe together.</p>
                  <p>Hence infer, Firſt, that of all Sects and Opinions contradicting one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, there can be but one True. Make a ſearch for this, finde it out, embrace it. Secondly, that this Unity of Faith and Religion requires;
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:119650:82"/>that all the members belive all, and every one (at leaſt implicitly) of the particular Points propoſed by the true Church; and disbelieve no one of them.

                  <p>Conſider ſecondly, the <hi>admirable <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> and concord which is amongſt the <hi>Roman</hi> Cotholicks, in all the other things which concerne their Religion.

As for the function of <hi>Preaching</hi> the word of God to the People, their Unity is wonderful; all that are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited to that office (for none takes it upon him on his owne accord) have their Commiſſion, and are ſent either immediatly, or mediatly from one; to wit the ſupream Biſhop in the world, the Pope: and in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Preaching, no one of them teacheth different points of Faith, or teacheth otherwiſe of matters of Faith than the reſt doe.

<hi>form of worſhip,</hi> and Lyturgie (which is Maſſe, moſt religious and majeſticall every where) their practice is moſt uniform: As for their <hi>Ceremonies</hi> (great incite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to devotion) they keep a great decorum in the uſe of them; and that variety is not without great uniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: and as for <hi>Prayer,</hi> as the Prieſts have every one a ſet portion of their breviary, to be recited every day; ſo for the lay peoples comfort, and devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, moſt excellent prayers (and thoſe many) have been compoſed by that Church; and the ſelf ſame are uſed by all the members of that Church, where ever they reſide in any part of the world: Nor are theſe Enthuſiaſtes of our times for their prayer, <hi>extempore,</hi> to be compared with the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, who perform that kinde of Prayer, both more diſcreetly, more frequently and more religiouſly: in fine, their Unity, and uniformity ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears

                  <p>Secondly, it is the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks only; becauſe in them only is verified that which the name Catholick im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports: The word <hi>Catholick</hi> is a Greek word, and it ſignifies <hi>

                  <head>The third Point.</head>
                  <p>Conſider and ponder, the reaſon why Sectaries have no right to that honorable and Antient appellation of Catholicks: The firſt is, becauſe there is no congruity betwixt the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of the word Catholick and any one of theſe ſects, for they are not Univerſall in any of the four wayes
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:119650:95"/>mentioned in the former point; much leſſe in them all.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they can pretend no more why they ſhould be called Catholicks, than the <hi>Donatiſts, Arians,</hi> or other Sects could formerly: which not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding were oppoſed and confuted in this very point, by Saint <hi>Auſtin,</hi> S. <hi>Hierom,</hi> Saint <hi>Chryſoſtom;</hi> as alſo by <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cianus,</hi> S. <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> S. <hi>Cyrill,</hi> and <hi>Juſtin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The practice of all ſorts of people (yea of thoſe who are of the particular Sects themſelves) is to give Sectaries their names, either from the authors name, who firſt broached that Sect; as the <hi>Arians, Pelagians, Donatiſts, Montaniſts, Manicheans, Lutherans, Calve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> and others: or, elſe from ſome principall Tenent which they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; Hence the <hi>Monothelites, Proteſtants, Puritans, Independents,</hi> and <hi>Presbyterians</hi> have their names; or from ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploit, or genious of the perſons; as the <hi>Iconaclaſts, Geuſes, Quakers:</hi> none ever gave theſe the name of Catholick.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Sectaries do not, nor dare they own the name of Catholick at ſuch times, as fidelity to their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:119650:95"/>moſt requires; as firſt, when they are brought before any Juſtice, Judge, or Tribunal, either upon ſcore of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or to give evidence in Court upon any other action: true it is, in time of diſputation about the name Catholick, who ſhould have the beſt title to it; then being conſtrained by their Adverſaries to a forc't put, and poſitive anſwer to the queſtion; they will let fall theſe, or the like propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; we are Catholicks as well as you; we are all Catholicks; all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are Catholicks: ungroundedly ſpoken, and ſooner ſaid than proved; unleſſe taking the queſtion for the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument be good proof.</p>
                  <p>In like manner, when any <hi>Proteſtant, Presbyterian, Independent,</hi> or the like (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about to die) is deſired to declare himſelf in point of Religion; he will not ſay thus; <hi>I die a Catholick,</hi> for the

                        <hi>Note.</hi>
                     </note> ſpectatours and auditours would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately conclude that he dyed a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt; but he would declare himſelf thus: <hi>I die a Proteſtant, Presbyterian, or the like; or I die a member of the Church of</hi> England; which is in effect to ſay,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:119650:96"/>he dies a <hi>Proteſtant:</hi> and thus the titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterburie</hi> Mr. <hi>Laud</hi> and ſome other great Perſonages that died the ſame death, before and after him, declared themſelves, at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, which was both moſt unſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for diſſembling, and at which pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod a man ſhould be ſerious, if ever; and yet theſe great Perſons, to hold an argument, whileſt they were in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe upon who had the beſt claim to the honourable title of Catholick, would undoubtedly have ſtood for it themſelves.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. That thoſe who deſire to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Catholicks by all Sects and

                  <p>FOr a perfect information, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of this truth, that the priviledge of propheſying is a mark of Chriſts Church; Conſider firſt the infallible teſtimony of Gods word; <hi>Your ſons and your daughters ſhall prophecy, and your young men ſhall ſee viſions,</hi> Joel 2. Behold Gods promiſe by his Prophet: and that this was made to the Church of Chriſt, witneſſe the Prince of the Apoſtles Saint <hi>Peter;</hi> who cites theſe very words of <hi>Joel, Acts</hi> 2. to prove whats here intended: Nor is Saint <hi>Paul</hi> inferiour to Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in the proof of this point: for in his indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the graces given to the Church <hi>Gratis,</hi>

                  <p>Conſider ſecondly, the excellency of this endowment, and how ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:119650:97"/>able it is to notifie unto us which is the true Church: Prophets are called <hi>videntes,</hi> by reaſon of that kind of intuitive knowledge which they have of future things, not as at a diſtance onely, but as actually preſent; they need no ſuch window in mans breaſts, as that <hi>momus</hi> wiſhed for, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to ſee into mens hearts: they anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate what the ſucceſſion of time brings to others; and the celeſtiall ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets which others have from the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond or third hand, they have them immediately from the divine Wiſdom; and certainly the knowledge of future things contingent is not attainable either by the nature or art of man; it can only be had from God: and who have it, may deſervedly be held for great correſpondents with him: and this truth is expreſſed to the full in theſe words following: <hi>Declare the things that are to come, and we ſhall know that ye are Gods:</hi> Iſa. 41.

                  <p>Conſider firſt, (for prevention of objections againſt the gift of prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies being an argument, that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church is the true Church) that though God may, or have revealed things to come by perſons not known to be of the true Church, or in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours; as he did by <hi>Balaam</hi> Number 24. v. 17. foretell the Star which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared at our Saviours birth; and by
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:119650:100"/>the <hi>Sybils,</hi> whoſe acroſtick Poem is full of moſt clear predictions about our Saviour: Yet he will never permit a thing contingent to be foretold, and fulfilled, in confirmation of a falſ reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: Beſides, this makes nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the intent of this Meditation; which is to ſhew, firſt, that the gift of propheſie is a mark of Chriſts true Church; and this is proved by ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: 2. That this gift is found to be eminent in the Roman Church; and ſo it appears evidently proved in this point going before: 3. That that Sect cannot poſſibly be the true Church, which is deſtitute of this gift; becauſe it wants this mark, which is inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from the true Church: for the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative here (as in all other marks) ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits no latitude; but excludes all ſects devoid of theſe marks, from poſſibility of being the true Church: and to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand how truly Sectaries are deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the gift of Propheſie.</p>
                  <p>Conſider ſecondly, that in reall truth they could never inſtance any particular Propheſies, delivered by members of their Sects in confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:119650:101"/>of their doctrine; nor indeed have they any perſon endowed with the gift of any true propheſie at all: True it is, that <hi>Luther</hi> propheſied once, that if he
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>cochleus in aun.</hi> 1525.</note> lived but to preach his doctrine two years longer, the Pope, Cardinals, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Monks, Nuns, Towers, Bels, and Maſſes, would all vaniſh away: he preached afterwards, according to his manner, not onely two years, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt twenty two; yet theſe things are al extant; none of them vaniſhed: hence infer that <hi>Luther</hi> proved himſelf a falſe prophet by this, and his doctrine falſe: according to what is Writ in Deuter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onomy, <hi>cap.</hi> 18. of falſe prophets: and that of <hi>Jeremy: Thy Prophets</hi> (England) <hi>have ſeen falſe and fooliſh things,</hi> Lam. 2.</p>

                  <p>To underſtand how eaſie and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious means the true Church of Chriſt hath for the compoſing of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies: Conſider firſt, that it belongs to the divine providence (which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it ſelfe to a care over every the leaſt individuum of the moſt contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible ſpecies amongſt natural things) not to let his Church want any thing of thoſe which are required <hi>ad melius eſſe,</hi> much more to ſupply it with whats abſolutely neceſſary; as means
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:119650:103"/>clear and eaſie for the judging of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies is.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, what perfection the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſh Synagogue had in this kinde, that <hi>à fortiori,</hi> is to be ſuppoſed in Chriſts Church; for it was but the handmaid, this the Spouſe; if the ſhaddow, this the Sun; if the type, this the reall thing prefigured; if it had a living judge, an infallible judge (who was to ſhew <hi>the truth of judgment</hi>) and a judge to whoſe final ſentence that people was to ſtand, upon pain of death: ſhall the Church of Chriſt (in which the moſt weighty controverſies of divine Faith and eternal ſalvation, are raiſed every foot by Hereticks) want ſuch means? Aſſuredly no.</p>
                  <p>Conſider thirdly, the many Texts of Scripture (yea and as clear in the confirmation of this, as of any point whatſoever) by which the Church of Chriſt is impowred with an infallible authority for deciding Controverſies, even of the higheſt nature: <hi>All power is given to me in heaven and in earth; goe ye therefore and teach all Nations,</hi> Mat. 28. in which words, the <hi>emphaſis</hi> of that

                  <head>The third Point.</head>
                  <p>Conſider now, that ſince the true
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:119650:104"/>Church of Chriſt (where ever it be now) hath his infallible power of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving all doubts in matters of Faith; as the forementioned places of ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture (beſides many more) confirm: and ſince ſome one of the various reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions now extant in the world muſt be Chriſts true Church, and have this power; for ſtill there is a Church, and it the Ground and Pillar of <hi>Truth,</hi> Tim. 1.3. let us ſee what Church ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathizeth beſt, or rather is (as ſome one muſt be) identified with Chriſts true Church in this point, and by good conſequence in all others.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, therefore this infallible judge, and compoſer of all controverſies in Chriſts Church formerly, could be no other, than either the head of it, or ſome repreſentative body of the Church, or both joyntly together; no other means of having a living judge can more probably, yea or poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be affigned; for all the mombers of the church, men, women &amp; children cannot be collected together into one conſult; we ſee alſo that a Parliament, in w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> ſome one is preſident above the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:119650:105"/>is the repreſentative body of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, or Common wealth: and what it (being a law full one) acts, is the act of the whole Nation: we know more over, that in the primitive Church this judge was no other, but ſuch an one as is here intended, to wit, the chief paſtor and head of the Church, or a General Councel, or both; and by ſuch a judge was <hi>Arius</hi> condemned, to wit, by the Councel of <hi>Nice,</hi> in which <hi>Hoſius</hi> (Biſhop of <hi>Corduba</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi>) was Preſidentin the place of Pope <hi>Silveſter,</hi> who ſent him and confirmed the acts of that Councel: So was <hi>Macedonius</hi> condemned in the firſt Councel of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople:</hi> So <hi>Neſtorius</hi> in the <hi>Epheſine</hi> Councel: ſo <hi>Eutiches</hi> in the Councel of <hi>Calcedon:</hi> ſo in all ſuceeding ages, Controverſies (as they riſe) were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided, and Hereticks condemned af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the foreſaid manner: therefore that living judge, ſo neceſſary, muſt be ſuch an one.</p>
                  <p>Conſider ſecondly, that the ſame praxis hath alwayes been held in the Roman Church, and is held ſtill; eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen general Councels have been called
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:119650:105"/>and confirmed by the ſupream Biſhops or Popes of Rome; the firſt whereof was the <hi>Nicene</hi> Councel, and the laſt the Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> in which ſate ſix Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinalls, four Legates, three Patriarks, thirty two Archbiſhops, and Biſhops two hundred and twenty eight, beſides Abbots, Generals of Religious orders, and a great number of divines, ſent by ſuch Biſhops, as for infirmity, or other juſt reaſons, could not be preſent: And that this Councell was not of as great Authority as any of the firſt four were, can never be proved; all that can be urged againſt this Councell, muſt be grounded upon that falſe, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded (but dreadfull, fince all Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries venter their ſalvation upon, on the ſame) ſuppoſition, that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church hath fallen from the true and Primitive Faith. <hi>Prove this your ſuppoſition (you miſerable men) which you could never yet prove, or be converted; or looſe your ſouls; of which you run a moſt deſperate hazard, by forſaking that Church (which is acknowledged by your ſelves to have been once the true Church) meerly upon</hi> Luthers <hi>hare word that it hath loſt the true faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:119650:106"/>
                  <p>Conſider thirdly, that ſince there is no other Church now in the world; but the Roman Church, which holds the ſame way and manner of deciding controverſies which the Primitivs church held; nay, nor hath any means to procure ſuch a judge (for want of a head, to call and confirm a Generall Councel, and Biſhops to conſult, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act, and ſee that the inferiour Paſtours put in execution what was enacted) Hence it follows, that the Roman Church is the onely true Church of Chriſt.</p>

                  <head>The fourth Point.</head>
                  <p>Conſider laſtly, that ſince Sectaries reject the authority of the Popes, nor can have General Councels, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently no living judge; they muſt fly either to ſcripture alone, or to the private ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>As for the ſcripture; firſt, it cannot perform the Office of a Judge; which is clearly to pronounce ſentence, ſo that both parties which conteſt about the thing controverted may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and acknowledge who is caſt, who hath got the better. 2. There is
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:119650:106"/>a difference betwixt the written laws, and the judge in civill matters; the one is the rule acording to which the judg muſt give ſentence; but the other (to wit the judge) muſt give the ſentence; he is the mouth of the law, and muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret its, land the legiſlatours mind: now the ſame Analogy and compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon holds betwixt the holy ſcripture (and the written law of God) and the eccleſiaſtical judge. 3. About the ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelf, ariſe many controverſies, which have been long agitated to and fro; as what Books are Canonical, which Apocriphal; the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks ſay the books of <hi>Judith, Toby, Wiſdome, Eccleſiaſticus,</hi> the firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of the Macchabees, are canonicall ſcripture; the Proteſtants deny them to be ſo: Now, how ſhall this great controverſie be decided: the ſcripture cannot give ſentence, for it hath not a living voice; in like manner, about the ſenſe and meaning of many places of the canonical ſcriptures, many long quarels have been amongſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Sectaries themſelves, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them and Roman Catholicks;
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:119650:107"/>the ſcripture it ſelf can never compoſe theſe controverſies, for want of a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving voice.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 The old Hereticks had never been convinced, nor condemned, i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>As for the private ſpirit, this muſt either be ſuppoſed to be an infallible judge, or not, if not; Sectaries can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have their controverſies truly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided; for this judge may erre, give a falſe reſolution, and ſo expoſe poore ſoules to an evident danger of fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently <note place="margin">

                  <p>Conſider firſt, that what our Saviour foretold, begun ſoon to be verificd; of men that perſecuted Chriſts church, the Jews, Pagan Princes &amp; hereticks are the chief.

                  <p>Ponder firſt, that all who are out of the true Church, are incapable (whileſt they remain ſo) of this great pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of martyrdome: for without Catholick and true faith, it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to pleaſe God; and without plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing God, as little poſſible to be a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr: Now thoſe who are not mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſts true Church, cannot have true faith, whileſt they remain ſo.</p>
                  <p>Hence infer, that though Sectaries ſuffer upon ſcore of Religion, as ſome of ſeverall Sects have; yet none of them are martvrs: for as amongſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Sects of believers, there can be but one true Church; ſo amongſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſorts of ſufferers, theres one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">

<pb n="206" facs="tcp:119650:112"/>be ſuffereth, makes a Martyr:</hi> Let him ſuffer torments and death, never ſo willingly, and that upon account of Religion; yet he can be no martyr, unleſſe his Religion be the true one: <hi>Occidi poteſt, coronari non poteſt;</hi> ſayes that holy Father.</p>
                  <p>Infer ſecondly, that he who will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Primitive Martyrs to have been of the ſame Religion with the Roman Catholicks which now are, muſt poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively prove in what, and when the Roman Church (which was once the true Church even by the Confeſſion of all Sectaries) did fall from being the true Church: This fall, this change, this tranſition is inconceptible; and yet Sectaries are obliged to prove it, or elſe return to that Church again.</p>
                  <p>Ponder ſecondly, that in caſe it were ſuppoſed that Sectaries might be capable of being truly Martyrs: yet no one ſect, no nor all ſects together, (out of all which <hi>Fox</hi> makes his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs) could make up a Martyrologe comparable to what is in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>

                  <p>COnſider firſt, that not only the the Prophets of the old law, but Chriſt himſelf alſo foretold many things of great concernment, which were to be veriſied, and fulfilled in his Church, or by it: in theſe propheſies alſo many large promiſes of ample privilegies and prerogatives made in reference to the ſame Church, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded; which were afterwards ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed: And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> often in
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10, 11</note> his Epiſtles intimateth that the Jewiſh Synagogue with its ſacrificies and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies was a Symbol or Figure of Chriſts church, and its proprieties.

                  <p>As for particulars: the <hi>Manna</hi> of the Iſraelites, with its proprietits, was a type of the Sacrament of the reall body of Chrift, and its effects; this is truly fulfilled in the Roman Religion.

                  <head>The firſt Point.</head>
                  <p>To underſtand how temporall fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity may be one mark, amongſt the reſt, which diſcovers the Church of Chriſt from all other Sects: Conſider firſt, the difference betwixt the <hi>ordinary</hi> and <hi>extraordinary providence</hi> of God: The firſt is that, whoſe effects we ſee and feel, in the production, conſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and operation of creatures: It appears alſo in the effects of mans mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, induſtry, or art; and in the natural effects of all ſecondary cauſes: The ſecond appears to us chiefly in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects which are ſurpaſſing the forces of naturall cauſes: the one confers ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, honours, victories, kingdomes, and the like, after that manner which
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:119650:119"/>we have daily experience, ſee, or hear of: <hi>By me Kings do raigne;</hi> Prover. 8. verſ. 15. ſayes God; and he cals them <hi>Miniſters of his Kingdome,</hi> Wiſdome 6. verſ. 5. and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, <hi>There is no power but from God,</hi> Rom. 13. By the other he give principalities, and victories miraculouſly, when, and to whom he pleaſes; and without the cocourſe of ſecondary cauſes any way proportionable to thoſe prodigious effects: Thus he gave the Jews Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries moſt miraculouſly; as to <hi>Joſu, Gedeon, Judas, Machabeus</hi> and others: which, as they were extraordinary ſignes both of the Divine Protection over the Synagogue, as alſo that it was then the true Religion: ſo the ſame Argument holds in behalf of the Church of Chriſt; that that people is it, on which God beſtows the like victories and benefits after a miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous manner.</p>
                  <p>Conſider ſecondly, (for the avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of errour in the weaker under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings) that theſe temporall fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licities are not to be ſuppoſed a mark
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:119650:119"/>of Chriſts Church in themſelves; but onely ſo far forth as they are confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red after a miraculous manner: for certain it is, that poverty is as condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing a means to eternal ſalvation, as riches: yea, heaven is far caſilier at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable by poverty (if it be imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced not only patiently, but willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) than by riches: yet they are in themſelves both gifts originally ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing from the hand of God: <hi>The Lord hath given, the Lord hath taken away;</hi> ſayes <hi>Job chap.</hi> 1. <hi>The Lord maketh poore and enricheth; he bringeth low and lifteth up,</hi> 1 King. 2. v. 7. <hi>Poverty and honeſty are from God:</hi> Eccleſ. 11.24. <hi>He humbles this man, and he exalteth that man,</hi> Pſal. chap. 74. So that there is no doubt of this: But we ſpeak here of the manner of Gods diſpenſing out theſe temporals; which, when it is miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, it argues which Religion is moſt favoured by Almighty God, and conſequently is his.</p>

                  <p>Conſider therefore, that the Sectaries ſince <hi>Luthers</hi> time, and particularly Proteſtants, do grant and acknowledge many things in behalf of the Roman Catholicks: Firſt, they confeſſe that the Fathers and Doctours of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church, believed and taught the ſame things which the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks now hold, and in which they and other ſectaries differ: Firſt, That Saint <hi>Peter</hi> was ordained, by Chriſt the head of the Apoſtles, and of the whole Church. 2. That the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> ſucceeded S. <hi>Peter</hi> in the Primacy of the whole Church. 3. That the Books
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:119650:134"/>of <hi>Toby, Judith, Eſther, Wiſdom, Eccleſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticus,</hi> and two firſt of the <hi>Machabees,</hi> were truly Canonicall ſcripture. 4. Traditions. 5. The reall preſence and Tranſubſtantiation. 6. That Maſſe was a ſacrifice truly propitiatory for the living and the dead. 7. That Chriſt gave Prieſts power to forgive ſins, and the necſſity of auricular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. 8. Pardon or Indulgences. 9. Purgatory and Prayer for the dead. 10. Praying to Angels and Saints. 11. Placing Chriſts image, and his Saints in Churches, and reverencing them. 12. Reverence to the relicks of Martyrs and other Saints. 13. That ſuch as were made Clergy-men could never afterwards marry. 14. That not only Faith, but alſo good works do truly juſtifie; and that theſe are meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious of grace and glory: Theſe, and diverſe other Tenents of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholicks, are acknowledged by chief Proteſtant Writers to have been taught, believed, and practiced by the antient Fathers: That the proteſtant. Writers confeſſe theſe points (which indeed is a ſtrange thing, and utterly
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:119650:135"/>ruines their cauſe) thoſe learned and laborious works, to wit, the <hi>Proteſtants Apology;</hi> the <hi>Progeny of Catholicks and Proteſtants;</hi> as alſo many other Authors do moſt amply declare; and cite the very words of all the chiefeſt Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Writers moſt faithfully about the the forementioned points.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they confeſſe that Roman Catholicks dying Roman Catholicks may be ſaved; this, the moſt of all Sectaries grant, both in their Writings and in their ordinary diſcourſe: tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as this acknowledgment ought to bring no ſmal comfort to Catholicks, when they reflect that they are of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which even in the opinion of their Adverſaries is ſoul-ſaving: ſo me thinks it ſhould make a great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion upon others which are not Roman Catholicks, and move them to embrace that religion in which all parties think and ſay men may ſaved: and this acknowledgment did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce this effect in that honourable Lady, the Counteſſe of <hi>Buckingham;</hi>
                     <pb n="253" facs="tcp:119650:135"/>which was preſent at that publick diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation betwixt Mr. <hi>Fiſher</hi> a Jeſuit, and Maſter <hi>White</hi> a Miniſter, held by the Kings order: For Mr. <hi>Fiſher</hi> demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Mr. <hi>White,</hi> whether or no, he thought that one dying a Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick might be ſaved? and he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering, that upon his ſoul, he thought ſuch an one might be ſaved: preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon this, ſhe reſolved to become a Roman Catholick; and what ſhe then purpoſed, ſhe ſoon put in execution, as many thouſands could witneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, They confeſſe that Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholicks do not erre in any fundamentall point of Faith; and that they want none of the things eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially requiſite to ſalvation: and therefore the moſt learned Adverſaries grant that Roman Catholicks are a true Church, or members of the true Church, though not the true Church to wit alone: The conſideration of this alſo (as of the former) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but comfort ROMAN CATHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LICKS, whileſt they remain ſo:
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:119650:136"/>Now what a madneſſe is it to fall from that Religion, in which all parties a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that ſalvation may be had: Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a prudent man will not venter his temporal eſtate upon a probable ſecurity, if he can have a certainty (provided alſo that it be lawful) much leſſe his eternall: No man can in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience expoſe his ſoul to hazard; if he may make ſure work:
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Note</hi>
                     </note> For though in things which are neceſſary <hi>neceſſitate pracepti</hi> only, a probable opinion of Doctours will ſave a ſoul harmleſſe; yet in things which are <hi>abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fary,</hi> and means without which ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cannot be had (as the being a member of the true Church is) the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt way is to be choſen.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, that very thing, which hath been by me prefixed to my ſelf as the end of my endeavours, in theſe twenty Meditation (which was to

                     </note> ſhew that the marks of Chriſts Church were to be found onely amongſt the Roman Catholicks, and conſequently that Chriſts true Church, was onely with them) is by many of the chief proteſtants Writers granted, by gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:119650:136"/>thoſe things which really are the marks of Chriſts true Church: They grant that S. <hi>Malachy,</hi> S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> S. <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis,</hi> S. <hi>Dominick</hi> &amp; others, were Roman Catholicks, that they were Saints, and that they wrought Miracles; they grant the mark of Antiquity; and that no known beginning of the Roman Church ſince the Apoſtles time (which is a convincing argument, that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun in the Apoſtles time) can be aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: They grant that the Roman Church never went out of any Society of Chriſtians, ancienter than it ſelf: They grant that no particular time can be aſſigned, in which any innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Faith was introduced, or change made in the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> which three things notwithſtanding they ought not onely to deny; but are obliged poſitively to prove the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; or elſ grant that their forſaking the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and calumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it, is moſt unjuſt; as moſt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is: Beſides this, in granting (as they do) that the holy Fathers of the Primitive Church held the ſame fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned opinions, which the now
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:119650:137"/>exiſtent Roman Catholicks hold; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently they muſt grant theſe two to be both one; as alſo the Roman Catholicks to have thoſe, who were eminent in Sanctity, Miracles, Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie and the like, (for the holy Fathers of the Primitive Church, were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons priviledged with all theſe great endowments) and by good conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to have the marks of Chriſts true Church: In brief, it hath been moſt amply proved by Catholick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors (as by the Proteſtants Apology, and other learned Books) that the ableſt proteſtant Writers grant thoſe things to be amongſt Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks; which are truly the marks of Chriſts Church: Read alſo the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth and thirteenth chapter in every Century of the <hi>Magdeburgians,</hi> and you will ſee how effectually the Proteſtants (like good advocates) plead the cauſe of the Roman Catholicks: who may truly ſay with <hi>Moſes, Our enemies are judges,</hi> of the equity of our cauſe.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt they diſclaim from the antient Fathers, and will not own them. That <hi>Luther,</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> and the <hi>Centuriſts,</hi> doe ſo, it is well knowne to all that read theire workes. And that many of the Engliſh Proteſtant writers doe the ſame, their works do witneſſe. True it is, many of them doe pretend to appeal to the Fathers; but ſince as many, or more of them, doe not, but the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; it appears by this that the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants are divided amongſt themſelves in this main point. Therefore, <hi>Mittam Egyptios, contra Egyptios, I will put the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptions, againſt the Egyptions,</hi> belongs to them. And ſince (of the forementioned Proteſtant Authors,) many do plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cenſure, and condemne the Fathers for holding popiſh tenents; hence alſo it followes, that they muſt grant them
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:119650:138"/>to bee all one with the now Roman Catholicks.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they grant that the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Fathers condemned in the ancient hereticks many opinions, which are held by the proteſtants themſelves now a days: This is inſtanced at large by the author of the Progeny; and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: that the aſſertions of the old he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks were condemned; and that notwithſtanding the Proteſtants now hold the ſame, is evident; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are forced to grant it; in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular about the Sacraments, the Scriptures, Freewill, Faith, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works, Mariage of Prieſts, Monachiſm and divers other points.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they grant that the four firſt generall Councels lawfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned <hi>Arius, Neſtorius, Eutyches,</hi> and <hi>Macedonius,</hi> and that theſe were truly hereticks: and yet ſome of them erred but in one point. Therefore, ſince to deny any one point ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded as a truth revealed by God, makes an heretick; and this by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:119650:138"/>own conſeſſion: let any prudent man judg whether the proteſtants do not expoſe their ſules to evident danger; Firſt by denying ſo many points now held by the Roman catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, and the ſame held by the antient Fathers alſo. Secondly by not having amongſt themſelves one, and the ſame body, or number of things to bee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved: but on the contrary taking to themſelves all liberty in belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; and being actually ſo various, and diſagreeing in matters of faith, as every where they are amongſt them ſelves: and ſo by granting theſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer to have been truly hereticks, for their denial of ſome one point (as they muſt grant it, ſeeing the four firſt general councells are received in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land) hence it followes that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne, and undo themſelves, and their own cauſe.</p>
                  <p>Founthly they grant that when <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> began, there was neither true prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, nor true paſtors, nor true do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in the world. Which thing though it be moſt falſe: yet by grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:119650:139"/>this, they grant that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves had no Church till <hi>Luther</hi> began, and what Church began then onely, could not be the true Church of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for want of Antiquity, apoſtolical ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, Viſibility and Indefectibility; which proprieties <hi>Chriſts</hi> Church muſt have. True it is, that <hi>Prideaux</hi> (as alſo ſome others) troubled at this ſequel,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lect.</hi> 9 <hi>de viſibil.</hi>
                     </note> denyes the former propoſition, &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends that the proteſtant Church was viſible in every age. But, firſt neither he, nor any other could ever yet prove any ſuch viſibility. Secondly, this argues that the proteſtants are here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, as in other points, at variance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly they confeſs (and in confeſſing this alone, they grant enough to undo themſelves and eſtabliſh the truth of the Roman Church) that they went out from the Roman Catholicks. The thing indeed in it ſelf is moſt true; and it hath been often proved by Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, that <hi>Waldo, Wicliffe, Hus, Luther, Calvin</hi> and the cheif of theſe new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formado's were ſirſt Catholicks and
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:119650:139"/>members of the Roman Church, before their change: But the thing now to be conſidered is their own conſeſſion of this truth. As for <hi>Luther,</hi> he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth in many places of his Works, that he had been a Papiſt, and went out from them.

                  <head>The third Point.</head>
                  <p>Conſider laſtly, Some inferences which may be drawn out of the two former points: firſt by their granting that they went out of the Roman Church (acknowledging alſo that thoſe who dy in the ſame Church may
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:119650:140"/>beſaved) they evidently make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves guilty of ſchiſme. 2. granting in this manner Salvation to Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, whom they confeſſe alſo not to erre in fundamentals (the latter of which is alſo inferred out of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer) nor to want any of thoſe things which are eſſntial requiſites to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; it followes that theſe other are not only guilty of Schiſme; but of hereſie alſo, if they hold any thing (as they hold many) contradictory to theſe confeſſedly foule ſaving te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents of Roman Catholicks. 3. This grant of their going out from the Roman Catholicks (which thing is evidently proved alſo in the third point of the meditation of antiquity) this alone makes the proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion guilty of novelty, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of falſhood: for the true church of chriſt began in the time of the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles: theirs comming after that time, could not be it, by reaſon of its po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriority; but ſome other falſe ſect. 4. The whole ſum of what they have granted in behalf of the Roman ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:119650:140"/>and againſt themſelves, proves evidently, that the Roman catholicks are the only true church of chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Since therfore in this great ſuite betwixt Sectaries (eſpecially Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants) and Roman catholicks about the true church of chriſt, and whoſe it is by right, we have not only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that the marks of it and of that of the Roman catholicks, are all one; and conſequently that theſe two are not in reallity two but one and the ſame church: but our adverſaries have moreover given us a judgement, by confeſſing in ſubſtance, that our claims are good, and their own ill grounded: what remaines but execution: not that which the miniſters of divine juſtice doe upon the wicked; which God avert: but that rather (for ſuch are my cordial wiſhes) which the equity of this cauſe exacts to be done by convicted perſons upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; by putting in execution that (true converſion to the catholicke faith) to which the evidence of theſe moſt <hi>credible teſtimonies</hi> (the markes
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:119650:141"/>of the true church muſt needs incline an impartial reader. Confident I am that the ſubſtance of theſe meditations cannot but convince, that the markes of chriſts true church are to be found amongſt the Roman Catholicks, and only amongſt them. If paſſion, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicate opinions, &amp; obſtinacy be laid aſide; if ſelf-ends, and temporal inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts be not prevalent, and diſturb rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; undoubtedly the teſtimonies of theſe markes will make it give ſentence for the catholicke party. Away with theſe fears of ſequeſtration, or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral incumbrances; heaven is a happy purchaſe, though it coſt you theſe; yea life it ſelfe. Such premiſſes as the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xis of your belief and life prepare, ſuch concluſions will death draw out in the end: Nor can either belief or life be good in a Religion which is bad. Chooſe therefore the beſt, whatſoever it coſt; ſince thy ſalvation depends upon thy Election in point of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: Mean while, Let this be the laſt (though not the leaſt) of the ſequels which may be drawn out of the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:119650:141"/>Meditations; to wit, a ceſſaſion of perſecution. Can reaſon, yea can nature chooſe but cry out, in ſeeing Catholicks perſecuted, where all Sects are tolerated; and in behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe mens blood ſhed, or ſought for, even by thoſe, for the good of whoſe ſouls theſe others are ſo piouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prodigall of their own blood.</p>
