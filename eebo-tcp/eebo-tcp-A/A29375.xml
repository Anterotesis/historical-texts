            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Secondly, your work is good, for you are the Miniſters of Reformation. I read of a King of Meth, ſometimes in Ireland, that being asked how certain noyſome birds that came flying into that countrey and bred there might be deſtroyed: Was anſwered thus, <hi>Nidos eorum ubique deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endos:</hi> The way to be rid of them was to deſtroy their neſts. Now for a long ſeaſon many noyſome birds have been flying over into this Kingdom, and have bred here; the work of theſe times, is to deſtroy thoſe neſts of Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites and Jeſuited perſons, and it is that work which now you are upon. <note place="margin">Foelix neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas quae ad me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Offenſio patientis,</hi> and for that you have matter too much, and your enemies too little, the great cauſe of their armes is but ſome peece of prerogative (if they pretend truly) a cauſe infinitely beneath ſo unkind &amp; bloodie a war as this is. Thirdly, <hi>Intentïo boni convenientis,</hi> and for that I dare ſay you are <hi>bellando pacifici,</hi> your war being to prevent warre, and your preſent bleeding to prevent ſome great ſickneſſe which this State would ſink under.</p>

            <p>Fifthly, If you do overcome, you ſhall not make your ſelves ſlaves by your own victories; we may truly ſay of ſome, <hi>Dum vincunt victi ſunt:</hi> when they have overcome others, they are ſlaves themſelves; your Religion, Laws, and Liberties ſtand all readie to reward your prowes.</p>
            <p>And ſixthly, If you be overcome and die, you die for God and your Countrey; who can bring his life into a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter market? bleſſed are thoſe that dye for the Lord, ſo that word <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore as heretofore ſo now much more labour to hold forth the vertues of him that hath called you to this great imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. As Souldiers are more honoured then others, ſo they ſhould be more vertuous; he had need carry much grace in his heart that doth daily carrie his life in his hand; and your Souldiers ſhould as well overcome the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys with their good examples, as the Enemies with their ſwords.

Secondly, that the Author of the Anſwer living farre from London, it was much longer before he could have the ſight of it: After he had it, he ſoone diſpatched his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, which he left in the hands of ſome friends here, a moneth ſince, to be publiſhed, but new Licencers being appointed, much time was ſpent in carrying of it from one to another for leave to travell ſafely: as alſo Printers being full either of buſineſſe or negligence, it comes to paſſe, that it hath been much longer in the birth then in the breeding. I hope it comes not too late to ſatisfie the conſcience of the well-affected, or to encourage thoſe that are engaged in this ſo neceſſary a defenſive warre; and it may be much more ſeaſonable then if before, whiles peoples mindes are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally inclined to goe up with one unanimous conſent perſonally to maintain the true Religion, Life and Liberty of the Subiect, which ſeems to be the likeliest way to put an end to our unnaturall uncivill warres, and happy ſhall that man be called, that ſhall help forward that great worke, and be a meanes to ſtill the ſtorme, the end of a inſt warre being peace, as the lancing of the wound is for the cure of it.

                  <p>Firſt, when God gave the power of the Sword to men, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9 6. he gave it <hi>indiſcriminatim,</hi> without difference, to all the world, <hi>Noah</hi> and his ſonnes being all the men that were then alive in the world; and he gave not the Sword onely to <hi>Noah,</hi> but to all his ſonnes that then were upon the face of the earth; not that every one might ordinarily uſe it, but that they might, as they thought fit, appoint one or more who might exerciſe that power that was given to all, as the firſt ſeat of it.</p>

                  <p>Thirdly, becauſe the <hi>Fluxus</hi> and <hi>Refluxus</hi> of civill authoritie, is from and to the people: If the authority of ruling in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth be given by the people to him that ruleth (I ſpeake what is <hi>Jure &amp; Regulariter)</hi> and returneth to them againe to ſee

juſtice done in caſe that there is no particular ſupreme Magiſtrate left to rule then the firſt ſubject ſeat and receptable of ruling po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer muſt needs be in the people. Now ſo it is, that both theſe are true, which I ſhall prove one after another: As firſt, The <hi>Fluxus</hi> of civill authority is from the people, civill government or authority is derived from the people to the Prince, or him that ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth: they ordinarily and regularly doe and are to communicate that governing power where with ſuch or ſuch a perſon is ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted: therefore ſaith the Lord, <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Where we ſhall ſee, that the whole power of appointing and ſetting a King over them, was given unto that people (as other Nations had it) by God himſelfe. For firſt, God directing them herein, doth not ſay thus: When thou dwelleſt in the land which I ſhall give thee, Take heed that thou do not ſet a King over thee, which thing belongs not to thee; but as a matter belonging to the people, he ſaith, when thou ſhalt ſay, I will ſet a King over me, be ſure that he be a good one, and ſuch as is pleaſing to me. Secondly, <hi>In that he doth take away the power from them of making a ſtranger, he granteth them a power to make a brother,</hi> as<note n="l" place="margin">Auferendo poteſtatem ad faciendum ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternum ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit ad facien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem nam qui poteſtarem ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam excipit ad regem ex pere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grina natione conſtituendum plane illam ſupponit ad conſtituendum expropria. <hi>Mendoza in Sam. 1. 8. 12.</hi>

                     <hi>Mendoza</hi> well obſerves. Now ſaith God to them, thou mayeſt not ſet a ſtranger over thee, which is not thy brother. Thirdly, what can be more plaine then the words themſelves? In the 15. verſe the words are reduplicated, <hi>Ponendo pones,</hi> according to the Hebrew, in placing thou ſhalt place: And that there might bee no miſtake in the matter, God is pleaſed to explaine the former word <gap reason="foreign">

                     </note>. Thirdly, this derivation of authority from the people will appeare alſo, if men do ſeriouſly conſider the ſtate of Jewiſh government. There was no people nnder heaven whom God did ſo immediatly reigne over, as their King; yet if we obſerve thoſe Kings that were the moſt immediatly appointed by God himſelfe, we ſhall finde the intervening choice of the people, inſomuch as it is ſaid of <hi>Saul</hi> expreſly, that the people did chuſe him, 1 Sam. 12. 13. <hi>Behold your King whom you have choſen and deſired,</hi> upon which words <hi>Mendoza</hi> obſerves, that by the word <hi>choſen</hi> cannot be meant <hi>deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</hi> becauſe that word was added too, as different from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, yet it is ſaid, 1 Sam. 11. 15. <hi>That all the people went to Gilgall, and there they made Saul King:</hi> Whereupon, ſayes<note n="o" place="margin">Quil aper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius neque e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim videtur aliter eum Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Mendoza, What is more plain? Neither could they make him King otherwiſe, then by conferring Kingly power upon him.</hi> I doe not ſay that God did not make a deſignation of his perſon to the Crowne, there is much difference between the deſignation of perſon, and collation of power. When the Iſraelites were under the government ofthe Judges, they deſired &amp; choſe a new way of government, ſaying to <hi>Samuel: Now make us a King to judge us, like all the Nations,</hi> 1. Sam. 8 5. And when God had yeelded to them, and had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned <hi>Saul</hi> over them, the people alſo came in with their electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſufftages.

And now ſecondly, for the reflux of authority, ſo it is, that in caſe there have been a ſupreme Magiſtrate in a State, and all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars ceaſe, and the Royall line be ſpent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and juſtice to be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, it returnes to the whole body to ſee to it. As when <hi>Joſua</hi> and divers Judges had ruled in Iſrael yet we read that after them, Judg. 19 1. There was no King in Iſrael, and then was the great ſinne committed by the men of Gibeah with the Levites Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubine: whereupon all Iſrael did take the ſword of juſtice, and they ſaid Judg. 20. 13. to the men of Gibea, Deliver us the men the children of <hi>Belial,</hi> which are in Gibea, that we may put them to death; which Gibea refuſing, they did all as one man, goe up in Armes againſt them, God himſelfe approving their act. And what had all Iſrael to doe to execute juſtice, if the power of the Sword did not returne to the people, <hi>vacante magistratu ſupremo:</hi> Neither can it be objected, that though Iſraell had no King and ſupreme Magiſtrate amongſt them, yet they had ſeverall heads of the Tribes, by whoſe power they did come together for the execution of juſtice, as it might ſeeme to be Judges. 20. 2. For ſometimes the chiefe of the Tribes doth in Scripture phraſe ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie thoſe that are chiefe in age, wiſedome and riches, not ſuch as were chiefe in authority.

                  <p>But the Doctor tells us, that<hi> Kings at firſt were not by choice of the people, but that election was a defection from, and a diſturbance to that naturall way of deſcent of governing Kingly power by a paternall right, </hi>pag. 9. of his Reply.<hi> That Monarchicall government is not a meere invention of man, as Democracie and Ariſtocracie are; but that it is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther </hi>ductunaturae,<hi> though not </hi>jure naturae,<hi> we being led there unto through the veines of Nature in a paternall or fatherly rule, </hi>pag. 8.<hi> as is plaine by the Booke of God, that the firſt fathers of mankinde, were the firſt Kings and Rulers: For we ſee </hi>(ſaith he)<hi> that the earth was divided amongst </hi>Noah<hi> and his three ſonnes, and ſtill as they increaſed, new Colonies were ſent out, who had the government both Regall and Sacerdotall, by primogeniture; whence it appeares, </hi>(ſaith he)<hi> that Monarchy was the firſt government, it being late ere any popular rule Ariſtocraticall or Democraticall appeared in the world: And that Monarchy, how ever we cannot ſay that it was </hi>jure divino,<hi> yet it was </hi>exemplo divino,<hi> the government which God ſet up over his people, being Monarchicall ſtill in </hi>Moſes, Judges<hi> and the </hi>Kings<hi> of Iſrael, </hi>pag. 8.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, whereas the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> ſaith, that <hi>the firſt Kings were not by the choice of the people at the firſt,</hi> p. 8. <hi>And that popular election was a kinde of defection from and a diſturbance to that naturall way,</hi> &amp;c. I refer Doctor <hi>Fern</hi> unto Doctor <hi>Fern,</hi> who ſaith both in his firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond book, pag. 67. of his Reply, <hi>It is probable that Kings at firſt were by election here as elſwhere.</hi> This I have ſpoke to already, and ſhall ſpeak to yet afterwards; neither doe we take it unkindly that the Doctor cannot agree with us, ſeeing he cannot agree with himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, whereas he ſaith,<hi> Monarchicall government is not a meere invention of Man, as Ariſtocracie and Democracie are, </hi>I refer him to what he ſaith himſelfe: For in his firſt booke, pag. 13. 14. he ſaith: <q>
                        <hi>We muſt diſtinguiſh power it ſelfe, and the qualification of that power in ſeverall formes of government: If we conſider the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of this governing power, and the manner of executing it, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſeverall formes of government, we granted it before to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53006:11"/>
be the invention of man. And when ſuch a qualification or forme is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly agreed upon, wee ſay it hath Gods permiſſive approbation.</hi>
                     </q> Yet in his Reply he makes this forme of Monarchicall government, rather an appointment of God, both <hi>ducta natura,</hi> and <hi>exemplo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vino,</hi> and not a meere invention of man, as other formes of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment are. Here I muſt leave him to agree with himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, whereas he ſaith; <q>That the firſt Fathers of mankinde, were the firſt Kings and Rulers: for we ſee the earth divided amongst Noahs three ſonnes, &amp;c.</q> I referre him for information to the 1 Chron. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 10. where it is ſaid expreſſely of <hi>Nimrod,</hi> that <hi>hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be mighty upon the earth;</hi> whereas if <hi>Noah</hi> and his ſonnes were Kings, their dominions being greater before the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And what his might was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is declared to us, Gen. 10. 10. <hi>And the beginning of his kingdome was Babel,</hi> &amp;c.

                  </p>

                  <p>This doctrine <hi>Pineda</hi> proves by examining the ſeries of all the Kings, inſtancing eſpecially in <hi>Solomon</hi> who was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed King by <hi>David,</hi> notwithſtanding he was not <hi>Davids</hi> eldeſt ſonne; and <hi>Abiah</hi> who was appointed by <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> though <hi>Rehoboam</hi> had many elder children<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as he clears from 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 11 18, 19, 20, 21 22.</p>

For though ſome of the Judges were called Kings, yet as <hi>Druſius</hi> and others obſerve, the word King was taken either more ſtrictly for Monarchs, or more largely for ſuch Captains and Governours as did rule over them; Surely God at the firſt, by all we can read in the Scripture, was pleaſed to appoint Magiſtracie it ſelfe and left the children of men free to ſet up that way and forme of government, which in prudence might beſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond with their condition, ſtill making people the firſt ſubject and receptacle of civill power: In proofe whereof I have ſtayed the longer, it being the foundation of all this controverſie.

                  <p>ANd as the Prince hath no more power then what is communicated from the communitie; ſo the people or communitie cannot give away from themſelves the power of ſelfe-preſervation. Becauſe the ſame Commandement that faith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill:</hi> doth alſo ſay, Thou ſhalt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve. Precepts that forbid evill, do command the contrary good. Now the morall naturall Law of God forbids a man to kill himſelfe, and therefore commands him to preſerve himſelfe: and as by a poſitive act men cannot make a Law to kill themſelves, no more can they not to preſerve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; the one being as ſtrongly commanded by the morall Law, and as deeply ſeated in Nature as the other. Secondly, becauſe if the communitie ſhould give away the power of ſelf-preſervation, the ſtate ſhould not be in a better but in a worſer condition then before. The King and Prince is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into Office for the good of the people, therefore called <hi>Pater patriae, &amp; Pastor gregis:</hi> not becauſe he may arbitrarily rule in the Common wealth as a Father doth in his familie; but becauſe of his tender care that he is to have over his people; and that the people might live more ſecure and peaceably in all godlineſſe and honeſtie: But if the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie ſhould give ſuch a truſt to any one that they might not at all defend themſelves beyond his actuall appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they ſhould be infinitely in a worſer condition then before, becauſe before ſuch truſt they ſhould be freemen; but after the truſt they ſhould be ſlaves, unleſſe it pleaſes the King through his own gratious condiſcention to let them be free ſtill: for what is a ſlave but ſuch a one who is ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely at the power of anothers command, that he may be ſpoiled, or ſold, or put under the Gallies, and there beaten daily, having no power to make any reſiſtance or ſelfe-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. Thirdly, it is agreeable to the Law of Nations and Reaſon, that no inferiour Court can undo what a ſuperiour Court hath done, As where an eſtate is ſetled upon children by Act of Parliament, no inferiour Court of Juſtice can cut off the intayle. Now ſelfe-preſervation is enacted in the Court of Nature, as he that hath read but <hi>Magirus</hi> unbound, I meane common naturall principles, will grant, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no act of a communitie can cut off this intayle from their poſteritie, or make ſuch a deed of Conveyance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by themſelves and their children ſhould be ſpoyled of ſelf-preſervation.</p>

                     <hi>Ob.</hi> But though by nature a man is bound to preſerve himſelf, yet he may deſtroy or put himſelf upon that which will be his deſtruction for the publick good; doth not <hi>natura particularis</hi> go croſſe to its own diſpoſition, <hi>ne detur vacuum?</hi>

Wherefore if the ſeat of power be in the community, and therefore no more power in the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme then was and is derived from the communitie, and the people cannot give away the power of ſelf preſervation: Then in caſe the Prince doth neglect his truſt ſo as not to preſerve them, but to oppoſe them to violence, it is no uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation for them to look to themſelves, which yet may be no act of juriſdiction over their Prince, or taking away of any power from him which they gave him, but is in truth a ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up acting and exerciſing of that power which alwayes was left in themſelves.</p>

               <p>2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, As the King and Conqueror came into the Kingdome by this claim, ſo we finde, that in thoſe times the conſent and choice of the people was in uſe for the eſtabliſhing of Kings amongſt them: For when <hi>William</hi> the firſt ſent to <hi>Herald</hi> to make good his promiſe, <hi>Herald</hi> anſwered, that he was right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full King, as being ſo by the conſent and choyce of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as is reported in <hi>Cambden</hi> in his <hi>Britannia,</hi> thus: <hi>As con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the promiſe of King</hi> Edw. William <hi>is to underſtand, that the Realme of England could not be given by promiſe, neither ought I to be tied to the ſaid promiſe, ſeeing the Kingdome is fallen to me by election, and not inheritance. And as for his own ſtipulation,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>it was extorted from him by force; neither he if he could, nor might if he would, make it good, ſeeing it was done without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the people.</hi> Yea, Hiſtories tell us, that when <hi>William</hi> the firſt had beaten <hi>Herald</hi> in the field, the people ſtill were in doubt whom they ſhould chuſe and ſetup for their King: For ſayes <hi>Culiel. Malmsburienſ Edwin and Morcard came to London and ſolicited the Citie that they would preferre one of them to the Kingdome; and the reſt of the Nobles would have choſen</hi> Edgar, <hi>if the Biſhops would have ſtuck to them: But the Engliſh, who then might have healed the ruines of the Kingdome, whileſt they would</hi>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:53006:14"/>
                  <hi>none of their owne, brought in a ſtranger.</hi> So that though <hi>William</hi> the firſt had gotten the field, yet was not he brought to the Crown, but with the conſent and choyce (though much over-pow'red and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-awed) of the people. So ſayes <hi>Speed</hi> expreſſely, <hi>Conſent thus got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, &amp; all voices given for</hi> William, <hi>he was crowned King at Weſtminster.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, As the Crown in thoſe dayes was obtained by the conſent &amp; choice of the people, ſo I ſay, that even <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour did not come to the Crown without all conditions: for the Kentiſh men would not receive him but upon co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition, which they propoſed thus, <hi>Moſt noble Duke, behold here the Commons of Kent are come forth</hi>

If theſe bee denied, they are here preſently to abide the verdict of battell, fully reſolved rather to die then to depart with their lawes, or to live ſervile in bondage, which name and nature is, and ever ſhall be ſtrange unto us, and not to be exdured. The Conquerour driven to theſe ſtreights, and loath to hazard all on ſo nice a point, more wiſely then willingly granted their deſires, and pledges on both parts given for performance.</hi> So ſaith <hi>Speed</hi> in his Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles, ſo that it is plain, that even <hi>William</hi> the firſt came not to the full Crown of England, without all conditions, and therefore our Kings and Princes pleading their right from him, cannot be Kings and Princes without all conditions. I know D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>F.</hi> tells us, that the Kings oath imports no condition, but is taken for confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſtrengthning of mutuall duties: whether that be true, let any judge who reads but theſe things. And indeed, if the Kings of England were ſuch abſolute Monarchs, as that no reſiſtance might be made to their commandments for the taking up of Arms for the defence of the country, when enjoyned by Parliament, then the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and people of England muſt loſe this power of ſelfe-defence: (for they once had it all men by nature having a power to defend themſelves) either by conqueſt, as being by force ſpoyled thereof, or elſe they gave it away by ſome indenture at the election of the Prince (for inheritance is but ſucceſſion of election inheritance or immediate donation from God, or elſe God hath forbidden this forcible reſiſtance by Scripture. If it bee ſaid that this people are ſpoiled thereof by conqueſt, and are as a people meetly conquered, then any other ſword that is longer then the Princes, may fetch back that power again. If it be ſaid that this people gave away this power by Indenture at the firſt election of their Prince, then let men ſhew us ſuch Indenture. If it be ſaid, that God hath forbidden ſuch a forcible reſiſtance by Rom. 13. 1, 2, 3. or the like Scriptures, then it muſt be affirmed that the Parliament are not the higher po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53006:15"/>
which D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Ferne</hi> granteth: for if the Parliament come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compaſſe of thoſe words <hi>(higher Powers)</hi> then that Scripture Rom. 13. doth not reach them, but rather requires others to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient to them; yea, if by the higher powers is underſtood onely the King, then the two Houſes may not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> make any forcible reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance againſt any petty Conſtable that comes in the K<hi rend="sup">•</hi> authority to do violence to the two Houſes. Surely therefore this and the like Scriptures are much abuſed, the meaning being only to command obedience to authority in all things that tend to the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of good, and puiſhment of evill; and therefore there is ſuch a power in the ſubjects, both by the law of nature, and conſtitution of the kingdome, to take up Arms when the State or two Houſes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe it; not withſtanding the expreſſion of any one man to the contrary.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> There needs no great skill to untie this knot, not mediator to make us friends, the Parliament hath raiſed this Army by an act of judgement and juriſdiction, not over their Prince, but in regard of Delinquents: ſo the ſame act may be a work of juriſdiction in regard of others, and yet an act of preſervation in regard of our ſelves. The execution of any malefactor in an ordinary way of Law is both preſervation to the State, and a work of juriſdiction in regard of the offender, ſo here; yet I do not ſay it is a work of juriſdiction over our Prince, but in regard of delinquents that are about him.</p>
               <p>Dr.<hi> F. Mr. Bridge gives us proofes for this way of ſelf-preſervation from the Law of Nature, it being naturall to a man, and ſo to a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie to defend it ſelf. And were this argument good, then might private men and the people without the Parliament take up armes and reſiſt, for ſelf-preſervation is naturall to them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> It follows not, becauſe, though I ſay every thing may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it ſelf by nature, yet I ſay alſo it muſt do it <hi>modo ſuo &amp; naturae ſuae convenienti;</hi> we ſay that all creatures do defend themſelves, and it is naturall ſo to do; yet we do not therefore ſay that a beaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends himſelf in the ſame manner as a man doth, or a man as a beaſt, but in a way ſutable to every nature. Now if a private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be in danger to be oppreſſed by a Prince, flying is more fit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence for him, and therefore ſaith our Saviour, <hi>If they perſecute thee in one City, flie to another:</hi> but if the State be wronged and oppreſſed, which is a publick grievance, then the State, and thoſe that repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent them are more fit to take up Armes for its preſervation. For Nature in generall teacheth ſelf-preſervation; Nature ſpecificated teacheth this or that preſervation: now the nature of a communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and of a particular perſon are diſtinct, and therefore though I ſay a community is to defend it ſelf becauſe <hi>ſui tutela</hi> is naturall to every thing; yet I do not ſay, that a particular private perſon may ordinarily defend himſelf in that way which is moſt ſutable to the communitie as the taking up of Armes is, yet I ſuppoſe no mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate man will denie this that the Subjects (though) not inveſted with authoritie have a power to keep out an enemie from landing incaſe of forrain invaſion, yea though the Kings Officers ſhould be negligent therein; or ſo malitious and treacherous as to forbid them to defend themſelves and their Countrey.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſaith the Doctor,<hi> He proves it by Scriptures, </hi>1 Chron. 12. 19.<hi> where the Word of God ſaith expreſly, that </hi>David<hi> went out againſt</hi>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:53006:16"/>
Saul<hi> to battell, but he was </hi>Sauls<hi> ſubject at that time; A deſperate under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking to make people beleeve this is expreſſe Scripture for ſubjects to go out to battell againſt their King. But he ſhould have added what is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed there, it was with the Philiſtines that he went out, and that he helped them not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for he did but make ſhew of tendring his ſervice to Aciſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Here I need give no other anſwer then repeat thoſe words fully that he replyes to (which were theſe) which Scripture I bring not to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> prove that a Subject may take up armes againſt the King, but that the Subjects may take up arms againſt thoſe that are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant about the Kings perſon, notwithſtanding the Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to the contrary. For ſeeing that <hi>Davids</hi> heart ſmote him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly for cutting of the lap of <hi>Sauls</hi> garment, and yet it is ſaid in expreſſe words in this text that he went out againſt <hi>Saul,</hi> its likely that his intentions were againſt thoſe that were evill and wicked about him.</p>
               <p>Then the Doctor brings in another peece of my argument, not the whole reaſon or the ſenſe of it, thus, Be ſubject to the higher powers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. but the Parliament is the higheſt Court of Juſtice. <hi>pa.</hi> 3. To which he replies <hi>(modo ſuo) well aſſumed,</hi> and ſo it is, for is not the higheſt Court of Juſtice an higher power; <hi>We grant</hi> (faith the Doctor) <hi>there is a ſubjection due to them,</hi> and <hi>if he meant by the Parliament the</hi> 3. <hi>Eſtates concurring all manner of ſubjection is due unter them.</hi> It's well he will acknowledge any ſubjection due to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament without the third eſtate. And if any ſubjection then they have ſome authority; but none they can have, if not power to bring in the accuſed to be tried before them. And if they have power to bring in 20 by force, then 100. then 1000. then 10000. which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be done without raiſing an Army.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then he undertakes, </hi>ſayes the Doctor, <hi> to ſhew out of Scripture, that Kings receive their power from the people, and hath the ill hap to light on Saul, David and Salomon for examples.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Doctor hath the ill hap alwayes to miſſe the argument which lay thus: If it be the duty of the King to looke to the ſafety of the Kingdome, and that becauſe he is truſted therewith by the Common wealth; then if the Parliament be immediatly truſted by the Common-wealth with the ſafety thereof as well as the King, though not ſo much, then are they to looke to it, and to uſe all means for the preſervation thereof, as well as the King. But ſo it is, that the King is bound to look to the ſafety thereof, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is intruſted therwith, as was <hi>Saul, David</hi> and <hi>Salomon,</hi> who came to their government by the conſent and choice of the people. Whereupon the Doctor replies, <hi>He hath the ill hap to light on Saul, David and Salomon.</hi>

The Doctor Replies: <hi>Therfore In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Courts have a power to raiſe Armes.</hi> (Anſwer) this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes not? For though I ſay every Court hath power to force in the accuſed; yet it muſt be in a way ſuitable: Now this raiſing of Armes is not ſuitable unto an Inferiour Court, but to the Parliament being a more Nationall and publike Court then any other is. The Dr. tells us indeed that other Courts have their <hi>poſſe comitatus.</hi> So the Parliament have their Orders<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to fetch and force in the accuſed, which are eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by law, aſwell as his <hi>poſſe Comitatus</hi> is: But ſaith the Dr. <hi>I did not know before that all the Parliament Souldiers were Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geants at Armes.</hi> Anſwer, how doth hee catch at the word, and let the ſence goe; the ſence, ſcope and drift of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was to ſhew that as they might ſend forth one who by force ſhould fetch in the accuſed; by the ſame reaſon they might ſend forth ten, and by the ſame Reaſon that they may ſend forth, 10; they may ſend forth 20, ſo 100, ſo 1000, ſo 10000: The Dr. puts off the Argument with a Jeere, becauſe hee hath no liſt to meddle with the Reaſon.</p>

               <p>Then the Doctor comes downe to the example of <hi>David:</hi> And whereas it is urged by us that <hi>David</hi> did take up Arms to defend himſelfe from the violence of his Prince <hi>Saul,</hi> the Dr. replies now as before, <hi>that Davids example was extraordinary.</hi> Well but when it is ſaid that <hi>David</hi> having advantage of <hi>Saul,</hi> did not lay hands upon him to cut him off as he might have done; what if wee ſhould ſay, that Act of <hi>Davids</hi> was extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary would not the Doctor tell us that our Anſwer was but ordinary: he tells us, <hi>pag.</hi> 31. <hi>of his Reply, that Conqueſt, one of the meanesiby whch Godiranſtates Kingdomes, and that</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid

Would not the Doctor take it for a poore ſhifting Anſwer from us; When we ſay any pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice is extraordinary, we muſt alſo prove by circumſtance, that there was an extraordinaries in the fact, or elſe acquies in it for our example: But be it ſo, that <hi>Davids</hi> example was extraordinary, is not our caſe now extraordinary? Is <hi>Englands</hi> caſe ordinary: hath it bin thus ordinarily, that Arms have bin taken up againſt the Parliament, and Delinquents kept from legall tryall by force of Armes? has this bin for many yeares? ſee how the Doctor helps himſelfe by this extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Anſwer. He tells us in his firſt Book <hi>p.</hi> 8. that this work of <hi>David</hi> was a meer defence without all violence offered to <hi>Saul;</hi> and is not this ordinarily lawfull for ſubjects to doe ſo much; the Doctor grants it himſelfe, <hi>p.</hi> 9. of his firſt Book, <hi>That perſonall defence is lawfull againſt ſuddaine and illegall aſſaults of the Prince himſelfe, thus farre, toward his blowes, to hold his bands,</hi> &amp;c. and the like; But the Doctor in his Reply has thought of a new reaſon to prove <hi>Davids</hi> example extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, <hi>becauſe elſe may private and ſinglemen do ſo too.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw:</hi> not ſo, <hi>David</hi> was not as every private man, hee was anointed of the Lord one that fought the Lords Battells the great States-man in the Kingdome; with whom were joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Ionathan,</hi> and many other chief of the Tribes therefore it followes not from <hi>David</hi> to every private man, but to the Parlaiment rather, who though not anointed as King and as <hi>Saul,</hi> yet with ſome anointment from the Lord into the place of Magiſtracy, eſpecially being as the <hi>Dr.</hi> confeſſeth, Co-ordinate with the King in Supremacy, ſo farre as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes Nomotheticks.</p>
               <p>I ſaid before, if <hi>Davids</hi> example were extraordinary, then hee had an extraordinary command for what he did; If ſo, how doth the Dr. ſay, there is no command or warrant in Scripture for ſuch a practice or kind of reſiſtance.</p>
               <p>To which the Dr. replieth,<hi> as if all extraordinary warrants, and inſtincts given to ſpecial perſons, ſhould be written in Scripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> So then this works of <hi>Davids,</hi> which before was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Dr. a meere defence is now come to be a matter of ſpecial inſtinct though acts done by ſpeciall inſtinct, had not
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:53006:22"/>
alwaies warrant from written Scripture before they were done, yet being done and recorded in Scripture, there is ground and written warrant for the lawfulnes of our actions, upon the like occaſions. I did not ſay, why then doth the <hi>Dr,</hi> ſay, there was no warrant in Scripture for <hi>David,</hi> but why then doth the Dr. ſay there is no warrant, or ground out of Scripture now for us to doe what we doe? though it might be inſtinct then, and without written Scripture yet it may be written warrant now.</p>
               <p>Then whereas that Scripture is urged (though not to take up Armes againſt our King as the Doctor ſuggeſts) 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 1219. Where it is ſaid expreſly, that <hi>David</hi> went out to Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell againſt <hi>Saul,</hi> the Dr. Replies <hi>Deſperate ſhifesthat theſemen are put to, when pretences and ſimulations, muſt bee Scripture ground for Co ſcience.

The Scripture faith, <hi>totidem verbis</hi> that he went out to Battell againſt <hi>Saul</hi> that this was but a ſimulation is not ſaid in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but the Scripture doth not ſay that <hi>David</hi> was mad, but that he fained himſelfe ſo; is there then the ſame reaſon of the one and the other?</p>
               <p>The example of<hi> Vzziah </hi>is next to be cleered: We find that the Prieſts are commended for valiant men, becauſe they thruſt out K.<hi> Vzziah </hi>from before the Lord, 2<hi> Chron. </hi>26. To which inſtance the Dr. ſaith,<hi> that </hi>Uzziah<hi> the King was ſtricken with Leproſie, and by the Law the Leper was to be put out of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and awell apart, which is not conſiſtent with Government, therefore it is ſaid of the King; he was a Leper, and dwel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Verſe 'tis ſaid, <hi>the King dwelt in a ſeveralt houſe, and</hi> Jotham <hi>the Kings ſon, was over the Kings houſe, judging the people of the land,</hi> not Reigning in his ſtead as the <hi>Dr,</hi> reads it then at the 6 and 7 Vertes, the Scripture having ſpoken further of the King his deeds and death at the end of the ſeventh it is added, <hi>and Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham his ſon Reigned in his ſtead,</hi> theſe words being annexed to his death as a conſequent thereof; and the <hi>Dr.</hi> takes them and annexes them to the 5 Verſe at the mentioning of his Lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, as if upon his Leproſie his Sonne Reigned, whereas 'tis plaine he only governed and not Reigned, untill his Father died; Here I cannot but wonder, that the Doctor ſhould ſo boldly venture to lay violent hands upon Scripture, that hee may lead mens Conſciences into his owne ſentence: But I hope the Conſciences of thoſe that feare God, will take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of ſuch dealing as this, and abhorre that ſentence, that muſt be borne up with ſuch practices; He would perſwade us alſo, that the Prieſts here are ſaid to bee valiant men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their home reproofe which they gave to the King or becauſe of their withdrawing from him the holy things which hee was not to meddle with, but let him ſhew us any one place of Scripture, where valour being joyned with an expreſsion of force (as here it is, it being ſaid that they thruſt him out) doth only note faithfullnes in ones place, by giving reproofe or the like.</p>
               <p>At laſt the <hi>Dr.</hi> comes to his owne Arguments, and labours to recrute them; and firſt he tels us that <hi>none might blow the Trumpet for warre amongſt the People of Iſrael, but the ſupreme Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, and therefore the</hi> Parliament <hi>may not take up arms or blow the Trumpet for warre, as now they doe;</hi> To this Argument di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Anſwers unanſwered have been given, yet hee is not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied but ſtill replieth, and I wonder that he ſhould, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring there is no ſuch matter that I can find as hee alleadgeth
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53006:23"/>
in the 10. Chap of <hi>Numbers.</hi> Tis true the Lord ſpeakes there unto Moſes, ſaying, Verſe 5, <hi>when yee ſound an Alarm;</hi> and ver. 6. <hi>when you blow an Alarm the ſecond time,</hi> and Verſe. 7. <hi>when the Congregation is to be gathered together, yee ſhall blow.</hi> and verſe 9 <hi>If yee goe to warre in your Land, yee ſhall blow an Alarm with your Trumpets,</hi> but theſe words in the Hebrew are all in the plurall number, ſhewing that the blowing of the Trumper belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed aſwell to the State and Princes, of whom he ſpake Ver. 4. It is not ſayd that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould uſe thoſe Trumpets exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively hee and not they; but rather hee joyned with them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he comes for his defence to that place of<hi> Samuel; </hi>I Sam. 8. 18. where ſaith he,<hi> it appeares that the people had no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy againſt their unjuſt Kings, but their crying to the Lord. Mr. </hi>Bridge<hi> anſwers ſaith he, </hi>Samuel,<hi> tels them not what ſhould be their duty, but what their puniſhment, the Lord will not heare you, &amp;c. It was indeed </hi>ſaith the Doctor,<hi> their puniſhment, becauſe all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy they had, which was by crying to the </hi>Lord<hi> ſhould not help them, which had not been ſuch a puniſhment, if they had had means to help themſelves by power of Armes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here the <hi>Dr.</hi> ſaith, that all the remedy this people had was by crying to the Lord, which Scripture he brings againſt our reſiſtance to prove what is our duty and how farre it extends: yet Page 49. of his Reply, he will not owne ſuch a Speech as this, ſaying, <hi>the Dr. had no where ſaid, that prayers and teares, are all the Subjects remedy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly it appeares plainely that this Scripture I <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. is not ſpoken of the Kings right, what he might doe; but of his fact what he would doe, for the King had no ſuch right o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his Subjects as to take their Childrens fields, and vineyards from them, for which <hi>Ahab</hi> was ſo ſeverly puniſhment, yet ſaith this Text of <hi>Sam. hee ſhali take your Daughters fields, and Vineyards,</hi> &amp;c. Neither can it be objected, that the word uſed in the Hebrew is <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, which ſignifies <hi>Judicium,</hi> Judgment, or, right ſeeing; it alſo ſignifies <hi>Conſuetudo,</hi> order or manner, as it is well tranſlated in the Engliſh, verſe 9.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, though it be ſaid, ver. 18. <hi>then ſhall yee cry out in that day becauſe of your King which yee ſhall have choſen, and the</hi> Lord <hi>will not heare you on that day.</hi> Yet it doth not follow that they had no other remedy but crying to the Lord, that's ſaid in Scripture that the People being oppreſſed with Forraigne E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:53006:24"/>
ſhould cry unto the Lord in their diſtrcſſe and becauſe of their ſinnes the Lord threatens not to heare them, but bids them goe to their Idols, and let them helpe them if they can; doth it therefore follow that they might not detend themſelves againſt forraigne Enemies, no ſuch matter: 4. Whereas the Doctor ſaith in this Reply, <hi>It was no ſuch Judgement to cry and not be heard, if yet they had a power to defend themſelves by taking up Arme;</hi> This anſwere is very ſtrange from one that calls himſelfe a Divine: for ſuppoſe that God ſhould ſay to his people, that had a power to take up Armes againſt their forraigne <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nemies, that they ſhould notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their power cry unto him, and hee would not heare them, nor deliver them from their oppreſſors; was this no ſuch judgement, becauſe they might take up Arms alas what will all our taking up of Armes doc, either way if God will not heare our cryes and prayers.</p>
               <p>The Doctor for his owne defence, and the Defence of his Cauſe ſayd in his firſt Booke,<hi> that if ſuch a Deferce as we now uſe were Lawfull, it is a marveilous thing that ſo many prophetsre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending the Kings of Iſrael and Iudah for Idolatry, cruely, and oppresſion, none ſhould call upon the Elders of the People for this reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, page 10.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I anſwered, ſee the Propher <hi>Eliſha</hi> expreſſely calling on the Elders to impriſon the Kings Meſſenger, 2 <hi>King</hi>

one. It is no ſinne not to obey unlawfull Commandements, but the Apoſtle makes it a ſinne here to reſiſt, and therefore the reſiſtance forbidden doth not relate unlawfull Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements but if lawfull.

               <p>IN the tenth Sect. of the Doctors Reply. I find little to hold us long; I had told him in my former Book that the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amentary proceedings were an Act of ſelf-preſervation, and uſed the Similitude of a ſteeres man ſhewing that in caſe hee do not his duty, even the very paſſengers in time of a ſtorme,

               </p>
               <p>This is to hang upon the word, and let goe the ſence, for<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> the reaſon holds to him that ſtands above, and commands as well as the Steerſ-man, neither will common reaſon ſay; that he is unofficed, becauſe the paſſengers for the preſent deſire or cauſe him to ſtand by, that they may looke unto their own ſafetie in the time of a ſtorme.</p>
               <p>Then he comes to prove that Authoritie and Magiſtracie, abſtractively conſidered from the qualification or ſeverall formes of Government, is of divine inſtitution. Wherein we do all agree, onely I excepted againſt ſome of his<hi> Media, </hi>that he uſed to prove it thus,<hi> By thoſe words the powers that are ordained of God; </hi>the Doctor underſtands,<hi> the power it ſelfe of Magiſtracie diſtinguiſh'd from the qualification thereof, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation of perſons thereto, </hi>how then did he ſay,<hi> Sect. </hi>2.<hi> The high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er power in </hi>Paul<hi> is the ſame with the King, at Supream in </hi>Peter; the Dr. replies,<hi> the power of Magiſtracie abſtractively taken, may by theſe words be proved to be of God, though the higher powers here be underſtood concretively with Connotation of the perſons that beare the power, for they are here propoſed as objects of our obedience which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be directed but upon power in ſome perſon, </hi>And here it is ſaid, a <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>In the after lines of this page the Doctor ſaies, that both the <hi>Fuller Anſwer,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Bridges,</hi> every where takes it for granted by me, that Monarchy, Ariſtocracie and Democra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie are equally the inventions of men? <hi>Anſw.</hi> I doe indeed, and the truth of it may appeare from your owne words, <hi>p.</hi> 13, 14. of your firſt Book as I have ſhewed already.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, ſaith the Doctor, Maſter <hi>Bridges</hi> concludes that my proving of the governing power to be of God, but the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of it, and deſignation of the perſon to be of man, gaineth nothing againſt reſiſtance, or depoſing a Prince that doth not diſcharge his truſt: for ſtill the people may ſay, we may alter the Government, and depoſe the perſon, becauſe hew as of our deſigning.

                  <note place="margin">Anſw.</note>This ſeems to prove that people cannot depoſe their Prince or alter the Government that is ſet up amongſt them; But what is this to the reaſon that he pretends an Anſwer to? to which was thus: If the Doctor grant that the qualification of the power is from man, and the deſignation of the perſon, then though the power it ſelfe be confeſſed of God by the Doctor, yet his adverſaries that are for the depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Princes, (if any ſuch be) may aſwell plead a power to depoſe the Perſon, or alter the Government, aſwell I ſay, as if the power it ſelfe was appointed, or ſet up by men. Now the qualification and power of deſignation is granted by him to be of man: And therefore he helps himſelfe nothing by proving that Authority or Magiſtracie in the abſtract is of God. To take away this, he proves that the people cannot depoſe their Prince, or alter the Government; I will not ſay a wild but ſurely a wide Anſwer as ever came from a Dr. D.

               <p>I ſaid not ſo, but that there is a difference between things diſpoſed by way of donation or ſale and things diſpoſed of by way of truſt: Things diſpoſed of by way of ſale or donation are not in our power to recall, things diſpoſed of by way of truſt are in our power to look to when the truſt is neglected: I would this Doctor would but doe us the favour as to alledge our words rightly.</p>
               <p>The 67. and 68. of his Book, are ſpent in proving aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the ſame things that he had ſayd before onely <hi>pag.</hi> 67. he confeſſeth it is likely that Kings were at firſt by election, which acknowledgement we receive: but how doth this agree with what he had ſaid before <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. <hi>pag.</hi> 8, 9 where he had ſaid, <hi>that election was a defection from that government that God ſet up at the firſt;</hi> In the 69. <hi>pag.</hi> he commeth to the matter of the <hi>Kings Covenant and Oath,</hi> which (ſaith the Doctor) <hi>is no conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on which the Kings of this Land are admitted to the Crown, but a confirmation and ſtrengthening of their mutuall duties by Oaths and promiſes, as it was with the Kings of</hi> Iſrael.</p>
               <p>The nature of this Oath we muſt leave unto the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Lawyers, who better know then we how it is taken, and on what termes, only thus much I read in <hi>Speeds</hi> Croni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, <hi>that the</hi> Kenciſh <hi>men would not admit</hi> William <hi>the Conqueror to the Crowne, but upon condition as I have ſhewed before;</hi> And if the taking of the Oath were only for Confirmation carrying no condition with it, why ſhould it be taken at the firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming unto the Crowne, and not rather afterwards.</p>
               <p>What elſe remaines in that Section is ſo eaſie, that the dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt eye that hath conſcience in it, may ſee thorough, for who knows not, that it is a greater evill for a Comittee to be wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by a particular perſon, then for a particular perſon to be wronged by a Comittee. <hi>Bonum quo communius eo melius, malum quo Communius eo pejus.</hi> And why doth not nature teach, that a Prince who is married unto his people, is to be faithfull to them as well as that the husband is to be faithfull unto his wife, and therefore that conditions are implyed, though not expreſt between the King and his Subject, aſwell as between a man and his wife; And ſo I paſſe from that Section to the Doctors two laſt.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> Surely upon your ſelfe, for there is no Church of Chriſt, but whil'ſt it remaines a Church hath a power left in it (though the exerciſe may be long ſuſpended) to ſee to it ſelfe, and its owne preſervation, I ſay a power from Chriſt to excommunicate, though it ſhould bee denied from men; and it ſeemes a ſtrange thing to mee, that the Churches of England have no power left, becauſe the High Commiſſion

               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> Neither doe we goe about to cut off our head, but ſay in the generall; if the Head ſhould bee diſtempered through ill vapours that ariſe from inferiour parts, ſo that it cannot diſcharge its Office, it's lawfull for thoſe that are in place, to give Phyſick to the body, that even the very head it ſelfe may be the more healthfull.</p>

Secondly, how can the people as eaſily <hi>renounce</hi> their truſt gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Parliament, when the People themſelves conclude and ſay, that what is done by the Parliament is Law; which they doe not ſay, as concerning the Prince, but rather know that for Law he is directed by them; <hi>but ſaith the Doctor this is to make them arbitrary, and to lead the people after them by anim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> The Doctor is much againſt the implicite Faith of the People, both in this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and his former Booke: It were well that men of his ſtrayne had been ſo much againſt implicite Faith in the matters of the Church, where it is more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, where they were not, witneſſe the &amp;c. as now they are againſt the implicit Faith in the Common-Wealth, where

it is of leſſe danger. Againe, why will this make the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment arbitrary, or caſt the people into an implicite Faith? it's granted by all that the King and both Houſes may enact Lawes, whereby the people are to be ruled, beleeving that thoſe Lawes are beſt for the Common-wealth; doth this make the Government of King and Parliament arbitrary, or rayſe the people to an implicite Faith? no more doth it here. An arbitrary government is where a King may rule <hi>pro a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>) if that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Browniſts, and Anabaptiſts, which are now ſo prevalent in the Armes taken up againſt the King, ſhould get the upper hand, what would become of the Kings Supremacy and Government?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> Here is a loud cry againſt Browniſts and Anabaptiſts, but who are Browniſts? not all thoſe that are againſt Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, and not for the Engliſh Common Prayer Book; for then all the Reformed Churches are Browniſts. And as for Anabaptiſts, I wiſh it may bee conſidered, whether they doe not take ſome footing for their opinion from the Common Prayer Booke: They deny Baptiſme to Infants, upon this ground, becauſe actuall Faith and Repentance is pre-required to Baptiſme; and doth not the Common Prayer Book ſeeme to acknowledge as much, when as before Baptiſme, the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes in name of the Infant muſt anſwer to theſe Queſtions, doſt thou beleeve? doſt thou renounce the divell and all his workes? I muſt nakedly profeſſe my judgement againſt that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, yet were it not good, that the very Common prayer booke ſhould come under conſideration upon this and other Reaſons.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if men were ſo much for Proteſtant Religion, and againſt Papiſts, as is here pretended, they would never be more afraid of Browniſts, and Anabaptiſts, then of Papiſts; ſeeing they are of the Proteſtant Religion, and differ not from us in fundamentalls, as the Papiſts doe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, ſuppoſe that that Army ſhould prevaile, wherein there are Browniſts, &amp; Anabaptiſts, as you ſay, yet is there not
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:53006:31"/>
ſo much danger that they ſhould prevaile to miſlead the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, who are three or foure hundred; as that Papiſts, ſhould prevaile to miſlead one.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, though there ſhould be Anabaptiſts, and Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts in the Army, yet they doe not ſight againſt the Kings Supremacy and his Government as the Papiſts do againſt the Proteſtant Religion, and being of Parliaments, whoſe Powder Treaſon is famous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or rather Infamous to all Generations.</p>
               <p>At laſt the<hi> Dr. </hi>tells us<hi> concerning Supremacy, that the King is Supreme, not ſo much in oppoſition to particular perſons, as in relation to the whole body Politique, of which he is head.</hi>

               <p>We ſay the King is Supreme and head of Kingdome ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and joyntly conſidered, Dr. <hi>Ferne</hi> indeed tels us, <hi>that the two Houſes of</hi> Parliament <hi>are in a ſort Co-ordinate with his Majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to ſome act or exerciſe of the Supreme power, that is to making laws, by yeelding their conſent.</hi> And if they bee Co-ordinate in that act of Supremacy, <hi>Paraeus</hi> and others will tell him that the Nomothetick part of Supremacy is the higheſt.

                  <hi> page </hi>89<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the<hi> Dr. </hi>ſaith, Mr.<hi> B. enters upon a looſe Diſcourſe againſt Epiſcopall Government, I reſerve him for his better inſtruction to a Booke entituled </hi>Epiſcopacy aſſerted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> No other looſe Diſcourſe then what his looſe Treatiſe lead mee into; and for the Drs better inſtruction I refer him to Mr. <hi>Baynes</hi> his Dioceſan, Mr. <hi>Parkers</hi> Eccleſiaſticall poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieor <hi>Altare Damaſcenum.</hi> And whereas I ſaid, now the Dr. ſhewes himſelf, he had rather the Kingdom ſhould be imbru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a bloody Warre, then Epiſcopacy ſhould down, becauſe he had ſaid in his Treatiſe page 25. <hi>that the King has Reaſon by power of Armes, to divert the aboliſhing of Epiſcopall Government.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Dr. Anſwers<hi> Nay, Mr. </hi>Bridge,<hi> you and your party in arms ſhow your ſelves what Spirit you are of, who will have this Land im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broyl'd</hi>

                  <hi>in a bloody Warre, rather then Epiſcopacy ſhall not down.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not ſo Doctor, there is not the ſame Reaſon, why you ſhould retort theſe words upon us, for I had no where ſaid, the Parliament hath Reaſon by power of Arms, to divert the evill of that Government; yea I am ſo farre from it, that I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe freely that if the King and Parliament would eſtabliſh that Government ſtill to be continued, that the people is not bound to riſe up in arms, to root it out, though I judge it evill: Yea if any Man be of that opinion I think he is to be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to live, enjoying himſelfe and his eſtate here.</p>
               <p>Then pag. 56. the Dr. ſaith to that of<hi> Sauls </hi>ſpeare reſtored; Mr.<hi> Bridge </hi>Replies,<hi> though reſtored before demanded, yet not before </hi>Saul had humbled himſelfe to<hi> David </hi>ſaying, I have ſinned,<hi> &amp;c. We know, </hi>ſaies he,<hi> what you looke for, his Majeſtie hath not bin aſhamed to doe it with great condiſcention.</hi>

And <hi>Zedekiah did that which was evill in the ſight of the</hi> Lord <hi>his</hi> God, <hi>and humbled not himſelfe before</hi> Jeremiah <hi>the Prophet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And though His Majeſtie had yeelded and humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe yet lower, he would be no loſer thereby, we know what the old Counſellors ſaid, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 10. 7. <hi>If thou be kind to this people, and pleaſe them, and ſpeake good Words to them, they will be thy ſervants for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Finally<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereas I had ſhewed that <hi>Ziba,</hi> and thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted to David in his diſtreſſe, were not of another Religion, and by Law to bee diſarmed, as the Papiſts now are; who have entertainment in His Majeſties Army: The Doctor anſwers, <hi>though by law</hi> Papiſts <hi>are not to have Arms at their diſpoſe, yet are they not quit of the duty and ſervice of Subjects.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They owe no more duty to King but according to Law, and by Law they are to bee all diſarmed; Wherefore good Dr. maintaine this illegall way no longer, give glory to God, and ſay you are convinced of this truth; which indeed you cannot but be; if you doe not ſhut your owne eyes: for you told us in your former Treatiſe, that Subjects may lawfully for their owne defence, hold the Kings hands, and how ſo, (if he raiſe an Army) but by an Army. Neither can you be ſo weake as to thinke that the great Senate of the Kingdome, that all the Commons, Gentlemen, and Nobles, ſhould be ſo at the mercy of every meane perſon, inveſted with the Kings
