         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT will not be improper, to premiſe to this <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,</hi>
an Account of thoſe Treatiſes againſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
which were undertaken, and part of them
publiſhed near the end of the Reign of King
<hi>Charles</hi> the Second. It is not unknown to the
World, how great a Care, and truly Chriſtian Concern
the Clergy of <hi>London</hi> in particular, did diſcover for the
Intereſt of the Proteſtant Religion, and for a happy U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of all moderate Proteſtants within this Nation;
nor with what Moderation and Calmneſs, Learning and
Plainneſs ſeveral Tracts and Caſuiſtical Diſcourſes were
Penn'd for that good purpoſe, and how ſucceſsful they
were, by the Bleſſing of God, to the leſſening our Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences,
and removing needleſs Scruples, and perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
great Numbers to return and unite themſelves to
their Pariſh Churches.</p>
            <p>This happy Succeſs gave them hopes of reducing by
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100257:3"/>
the ſame Method, the Papiſts among us, and put them
upon deſigning and writing for their ſakes, a Set of
Tracts wherein the Controverſie was to be fairly and
calmly ſtated betwixt Us and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and
ſuch Arguments and Reaſons uſed, as might convince
all conſciencious Papiſts of the Errours and Danger in
their Church.</p>

end of the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second:</p>

to three Queſtions,</p>
            <p>I. How far we must depend on the Authority of the
Church, for the true Sence of Scripture?</p>
            <p>II. Whether a Viſible Succeſſion from Christ, to this day,
makes a Church, which has this Viſible Succeſſion, an
Infallible Interpreter of Scripture?</p>
            <p>III. Whether the Church of <hi>England</hi> can make out ſuch
a Viſible Succeſſion?</p>
            <p>By Dr. <hi>Sherlock,</hi> Maſter of the <hi>Temple.</hi>

Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> eſpecially as compared with thoſe

16. A Diſcourſe concerning Auricular Confeſſion, as it
is preſcribed by the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> By Dr. <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
Arch-deacon of <hi>Middleſex.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus far had the Clergy proceeded with theſe Diſcourſes
at the Death of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second: and now, upon
the Acceſſion of a King of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Perſwaſion to the
Throne, they were quickly forced to change their Method,
and to be upon the Defenſive Part, their Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
being freely ſtruck at under the Countenance of a
King of their own Communion, by the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prieſts;
and heavy things laid to their charge for having Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niated
and Miſ-repreſented the King's Religion: They lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
feared any oppoſition from the Clergy of the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> ſince they could not but judge them ſo cautious
at least, as not to face ſuch inevitable Danger, and mark
themſelves out for Deſtruction, by daring ſo much as to
mutter any thing, much leſs write against the King's Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
which it would have been very happy for the Prieſts
(who have come off ſo ſhamefully ſince) if they could have
made it High-Treaſon at first, which I am confident they
wanted no will to do.</p>
            <p>However, our Clergy valued their Religion and their
Church much more than their own Safety, or worldly Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest;
and a <hi>Romiſh</hi> Priest could not ſooner begin the
Quarrel, and open the way to that large Controverſie
which hath been managing ever ſince, by charging our
Church with Calumny and Miſ-repreſentation of the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> than he met with an Anſwerer, who did indeed
deſerve the Honour of being the Leader of our Clergy, in
this large Controverſie, wherein ſo many have been forced
to engage.</p>
            <p>I will first give an account of the Controverſie with
him who wrote the first Book, called, <hi>A Papiſt Miſ-repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
and Repreſented,</hi> and then proceed with my <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:100257:4"/>
as Methodically as I can. In Anſwer to that Book
was first written,</p>
            <p>17. The Doctrines and Practices of the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> truly Repreſented; in Anſwer to a Book en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled,
<hi>A Papist Miſ-repreſented and Repreſented,</hi>

            <p>18. A Papiſt not Miſ-repreſented by Proteſtants; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Reply to the Reflections upon the Doctrines and
Practices of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> truly Repreſented.
By Dr. <hi>Sherlock.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>19. Remarks on Popery Miſ-repreſented, with reference
to the Depoſing Doctrine. By Mr. <hi>A. Seller</hi> of <hi>Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>20. An Anſwer to a Diſcourſe intituled, <hi>Papiſts Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting

            </p>
            <p>21. An Anſwer to the <hi>Amicable Accommodation</hi> of the
Difference between the Repreſenter and the Anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
By Dr. <hi>Sherlock.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>22. A View of the whole Controverſie between the

            </p>
            <p>After this, the Author of a Papiſt Miſ-repreſented

off Writing, and ſet Anſwers in Print, which they
were now grown ſick of, and for betaking themſelves to
Verbal Conferences, hoping for more ſucceſs by their

Prieſt, was pleaſed to ſingle out himſelf for ſuch
purpoſes; but for his fitneſs or abilities, no body could
find any, except this may be reckoned one, that tho' he
was Maſter of very little or no Learning at all, yet he
wanted not the Gift of Aſſurance to encounter the very
learnedſt Men among us. On <hi>February</hi> the 21<hi>ſt,</hi> 1686,

about the ſame time with Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> Dean of

            </p>
            <p>About this time a more diverting Project was ſet on
foot by the Papiſts, to make the Clergy obnoxious to the
Government, or to ruine their Reputation among their
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100257:11"/>
own People: The Repreſenter, who had miſ-carried ſo much
in his Attempt of putting Varniſht Popery upon us, is
known to have had no ſmall ſhare in the New Project;
which was to Repreſent our Pulpits as perpetually filled
with <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntruths and Calumnies, with odious Repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Characters of Popery: this was done under the
ſpecious Pretence of giving <hi>Good Advice to the Pulpits;</hi>
in hopes, no doubt, that the Government would have done
as Queen <hi>Mary</hi> did, Silence the Preachers, who took ſuch
liberty of ſtriking at the King's Perſon thro' his Religion.</p>
            <p>But if this failed, then to try the other part of the
Project, which was to have perſwaded the Proteſtants of
<hi>England,</hi> that notwithſtanding the preſent Oppoſition of
the Clergy, there was in reality a very good Agreement
between the Church of <hi>England</hi> and the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi>
and this was to have got the People to have ſilenced their
Clergy by running away from them as Papiſts in their
hearts: But both parts of this very Hopeful, but very

Having now diſpatched the <hi>Catalogue</hi> of the ſeveral

now to thoſe publiſhed by our Non-conformiſt Brethren a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Popery during King <hi>James</hi> the Second's Reign;
which, according to my beſt Information, are theſe:</p>

                  <desc>•••…</desc>
               </gap> Tranſubſtantiation a peculiar Article of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Catholick Faith; which was never own'd by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Church, or any of the Reform'd Churches; in

            </p>
            <p>Theſe are all I find written by the Non-conformiſts, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
we must reckon among them the Book written by the
late <hi>Henry Care:</hi> Whether he was a Member of the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> or a Diſſenter, I cannot tell; howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
I am ſure neither Party ought to be aſhamed of the
Book, which does very well deſerve a place in this <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,</hi>

I need not here to beg our Nonconformiſt Brethren's
Pardon for this Slender Account of their Writings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>POPERY,</hi> during the Reign of King <hi>James</hi> the
Second, becauſe I have uſed great Diligence to attain
an exact Account of them: however, if there be any
Diſcourſes written by them, but omitted in this <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,</hi>
or if any of thoſe in the <hi>Catalogue</hi> whoſe Authors
Names I could not recover, do belong to them: If ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

to ſend the Titles of the Books, with the Author's
Name, to Mr. <hi>R. Baldwin,</hi> the Publiſher of this <hi>Catalogue,</hi>
they ſhall be inſerted into the next Edition of this <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,</hi>
