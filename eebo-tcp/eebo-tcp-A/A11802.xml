            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT may be thought (<hi>perhaps</hi>) by ſome, which shall vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe
to reade this following diſcourſe, that my generall

haue no force to raiſe ſtormes of action, but to participate
in paſſion, with ſuch gufts as fall from aboue. I am not ſo

if I purſue as eagerly (as he doth) the ſide, and cauſe I affect;

in a contrary courſe, and whet the edge of authority,
with all the arguments of their art, to shew it ſelfe sharpe
for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his cauſe, againſt <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and his adherents.
And let not their goodly diſcretion, and moderation, delude
the world any longer, with vaine expectations, and promiſes,
as if they were (like <hi>Iobs</hi> faint freindes) <hi>lob 12. 2. the only people,</hi>

            <p>For the ſecond objection, made by ſuch, as thinke I am
out of favour, &amp; intend hereby to flatter my ſelfe into grace
againe; I let ſuch know, that as I account the favour of my
ſuperiours, to be a great bleſſing, ſo (beleeving I never loſt it,
at leaſt by deſert) I profeſſe ſincerely not to ſeeke it, with
any corrupt or ambitious thought. If what I write offend not,
it is the yttermoſt extent, yea crowne of my happineſſe here;
being for the reſt contented, and holding it a thing indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
to liue in any ayre, and to be buryed in any ſoyle; Since
<hi>I liue by faith,</hi> and expect the <hi>reſurrection of the just.</hi> But the truth
is, that as thoſe who looke on, doe often ſee, what the Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
over-ſee; And as thoſe who ſtand in a direct lyne againſt
the mouth of the Cannon, cannot diſcerne the danger co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meing
ſwifftly vpon them, ſoe well as thoſe that ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d a-loofe
off, and obliquely: ſoe wee that ſtand removed from the
ſteeple, heare the noyſe of the bells diſtinctly, and where
they jangle, and where they ring round, and where they vary
with muſicall, and delightfull changes; which ſuch as ſtand
vnder, cannot ſo perfectly judge.</p>
            <p>And wee thinke wee ſaw the danger coming, and were
more ſenſible of it, then many ſeemed to bee, that ſtood with
in the dint: And now (hoping the greateſt ſtorme is over) wee
behold the deliverance with more admiration, then many
ſeeme to haue done, which ſtood neerer the danger. And to
this end wee write, that you may read, and ſee, and applaud
your owne felicity with ours, giving glory to <hi>God,</hi> and due ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
to the inſtruments, he hath beene pleaſed to vſe in this
<pb facs="tcp:24673:5"/>
great<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and miraculous worke of his mercy.</p>
            <p>For to this end the Lord doth all his workes of wonder, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
well of their ſervice, who ſet forth his <hi>praiſe with the
beſt instruments that they haue;</hi> denyeing only to be gratious to
ſuch, as neglect his workes, or paſſe them by, without obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
and threatning to punish ſuch ſeverely, who rob him
of his glory, either arrogating it to themſelves, or imputing

            <p>Herein, therefore, I do but, with <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſalute <hi>God</hi> with a
ſonge, having paſt the red ſea, looking back vpon it with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration,
and beholding <hi>Pharoh Exod.</hi> 15.and his Hoaſt in it,

            <p>This is the true end of writing this treatiſe, wherein if I
erre in any point of Divinity, Hiſtory, or Pollicy, either in
relation, or application, I referre my ſelf moſt humbly to
the favorable cenſure of the Church and State, not being
willing to commit a fault againſt either, or having done it, to
defend it with obſtinacy. Yet before wee part, giue me leaue
to ſay, that whilſt I hope wee are paſt the danger, I would be
ſo vnderſtood as a man that partly feared, wee were not.
Warre muſt be proclaimed with <hi>Spaine,</hi> before wee can be
fully reſolued; othevwiſe our <hi>offenſiue warres</hi> againſt the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
Bavaris,</hi> or any other, &amp; our <hi>defenſiue,</hi> and <hi>divertiue</hi> warres

be anſwerable to our expences, if wee meane to holde out:
for though the horſe be fat &amp; ſtrong, yet if wee ride him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
without provender, he will waxe weake, and leane,
and trye vnder vs. To warre with the <hi>Emperour</hi> &amp;, hold peace
with <hi>Spaine,</hi> is to fight with one of our hands, againſt the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

at this preſent, are both headed, and feathered; pluck
off theſe, and they hurt not. And the way to pluck off theſe,
and ſo to make peace, is to ſend out our <hi>Navie</hi> (as wee had
wont) to fish for gould in their ſeas. For our <hi>Navie</hi> is the <hi>right
hand</hi> of our State, of whole advantageous vſe, wee depriue our
ſelves, when wee warre in a cold and lame manner, only with
the <hi>left hand</hi> by <hi>defence,</hi> by <hi>divertion,</hi> and that by <hi>land,</hi> where the
enemyes ſtrength lyes. This is, to fight, and let him <hi>chooſe</hi> the
weapon, and to ſpend our blowes, where wee ſee him beſt
<hi>armed.</hi> It is the <hi>Navie</hi> that weakens the Enemy, by taking
from him, and ſpoiling, what he gets to ſpoile others. It is the
<hi>Navie,</hi> that cauſeth his <hi>Weſt-Indian Fleetes</hi> to be waſted home
with ſuch a guard, as eat's out the gaine of that <hi>voyage;</hi> though
they returne ſafe, but vndoes him, if they miſcarry. It is the
<hi>Navie</hi> that payes the troopes by land, &amp; fills the Ercheaquer
faſter, then all the cuſtomes, &amp; projects, vnprofitable peace
can invent, though it would ſtudy to exact ſtill from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious
Marchant, even to his vndoeing. Witneſſe our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
warres <hi>in Yreland,</hi> where there was no boote for the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diar,
as in other parts may be found, (if at leaſt wee ſerue
them, and theirs, as they did vs, and ours, in the <hi>Paltz.</hi>) but all
the Army was to liue (as wee ſay) vpon the <hi>penny.</hi> And yet for
all that expence in <hi>Yreland, Scotland, Sweden, Denmarke, France,</hi> in
the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and all other partes, where <hi>Antichriſt</hi> advanced
his counterfeit <hi>croſſe,</hi> againſt the croſſe of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> how rich was
the ſubject? how plentifull all proviſions? how quick all
trades, &amp; trading? how well ſtored was the Ercheaquer with
Coyne, the mint with Bullion, the Tower, and all other places
with ordinance, ammunition, plate, hangings, jewells? The
expence, and waſte, of treaſure ſince, meerely vpon the old
<pb facs="tcp:24673:6"/>
ſtock, without any equall, annuall, and certaine ſupply, the
rayſing and allaying of golde and ſilver, without curing our
generall wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t (which <hi>Spaine</hi> withall the Enemyes, &amp; warres our
<hi>Elizabeth</hi> had, could not make her do as her <hi>Epitaph</hi> tells you)
is a witneſſe of this truth beyond contradiction. If therefore
wee haue warres with the <hi>Emperour,</hi> &amp; <hi>Bavaria,</hi> (heare my folly
and pardon it; <hi>wiſemen</hi> may proffit by the prating of fooles)
let vs haue it with <hi>Spaine;</hi> If wee defend the <hi>States,</hi> and <hi>our
ſelves,</hi> with the <hi>lef hand,</hi> let vs fight with the <hi>right hand</hi> alſo,
and put <hi>Spaine</hi> to his fence; let vs vſe both hands, or neither;
let vs (to conclude) fight in good earneſt, or lay downe the
bucklers, and ſubmit our ſelves to their mercy, who will,
without queſtion, cut our throates in kindnes with the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
expedition, as they haue done our freindes, vpon the
ſame tearmes.</p>
            <p>Conſider I beſeech thee, adviſed <hi>Reader,</hi> how the <hi>Navy</hi>
(which I ſpake of) lyes now idle; a great &amp; continuall charge
to the ſtate, the <hi>Marriners,</hi> the <hi>Officers,</hi> the <hi>Seamen</hi> of all
ſorts, waſte away, are vnprofitable, forget their profeſſions,
when, if theſe were imployed (as I haue ſpoken) they would
recover our reputation, be a ſecurity to our ſelves, a terror
to our enemyes, make vs againe Maſters, not only of the
narrow ſeas, but of the Ocean, beare their owne charges, &amp;
helpe to defray others. In which regard (giue me leaue to
proceede in playing the foole) I ſuppoſe if the <hi>East-Indian
Fleete,</hi> and ſtock, were thus imployed, we would ſoone finde
the odds of the adventure, &amp; neither the ſtate, nor the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant,
would repent them of the change, although wee
bought ſpice at the ſecond hand, or ſpent leſſe then wee doe
(as other Countryes vſe,) or permitted voluntaryes to trade
in thoſe ſeas.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the <hi>Hollander</hi> who findes how hard, or booteles it
is to ſayle againſt the ſunne, ſees his owne fault, and begins
to ſteere a contrary courſe, and though he ſtill hold his
<pb facs="tcp:24673:6"/>
ground, and trade in the Eaſt, yet finding it a drayne for the
treaſure of <hi>Christendome,</hi> it is probable he will leſſen his dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
there,and ſeeke out Weſtward for gould and ſilver, to
feede that couetous Eaſterne climate, as wee may doe alſo, if
wee be not <hi>too wiſe</hi> to learne, and <hi>too proud</hi> to follow, when
they goe before.</p>
            <p>But ſome object, that what wee had wont to get alone in
the Weſt &amp; South-ſea, the <hi>Hollander</hi> now meete's withall, and
takes vp, by fore-ſtalling the market; ſo that there will not
bee ſufficient, to beare the charges of both Nations. As if
the <hi>Hollander</hi> tooke all, and no fish paſt his net: Nay aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
if both of vs went out vpon this errand, both should haue
more, whilſt one helped the other. Beſides the <hi>Hollander</hi> is
more numerous in shipping, and thoſe commonly of better
ſayle then ours, and ſo fit for ſcouts, to beate the water; ours,
are better built, better man'd, better armed, fitter for fight,
and ſo like to ſpeede better, if there should be fraude in fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship.</p>
            <p>Thus much I thought good to add, not as a Counſellour,
but as an Intelligencer, for my King, and Country; and if any

force to moue that heavy Engine, yet the <hi>necesſity</hi> of the caſe
makes me attempt it, and put my hand, to a multitude of
others, who wynne hearts, and hands to this end: And the
ſame <hi>Necesſity</hi> pleades my excuſe, whilſt I ſeeme to tranſgreſſe

way to make peace, or to ſaue the effuſion of Chriſtian blood

the three eldest ſonnes of Ishai went, and followed Saul to the
battell:</hi> Now as he was of mature age, and of a gooly
preſence ſo, it is like, he was an olde ſouldier, of
great experience in the warres: And that as others
eſteemed him, ſuch ſo he knew his owne worth, &amp;
value, wherefore like an olde, &amp; expert <hi>Commander,</hi>
he taketh vpon him to curbe in, &amp; reſtrayne, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitiue
ignorance, and rash foole-hardynes (as he
thought) of this ſilly shepheards lad, ſaying to him
(in anger) <hi>why cameſt thou downe hither? &amp; with whom haſt
thou left thoſe few sheepe in the wildernes? I know the pride, &amp;

the ſtouteſt would gladly withdrawe themſelues, if
they could with the ſafety of their honors? doeſt
thou thinke thy ſelfe able, to doe more then we can
doe, who are ſouldiers by profeſſion, men of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
of approved ſtrength, &amp; courage? Thou art
a babe, a ſuckling, an effeminate boy, a freshwater
ſouldier? Why; what a folly was it for thee, to leaue
the care of the sheepe, &amp; come hither; to looſe them
there, thy ſelfe here? This muſt needes proceede
from that ambitious, &amp; proude heart of thine, which
I knowe puff's thee vp, ever ſince thou wert enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned
to be one of <hi>Saules</hi> Muſitians: But thou art
much miſtaken; it is farr more eaſy to compoſe a

then to handle a ſpeare, the battell-axe, the ſworde,

of muſitians ſuits thee better, then a Company of
Souldiers; and that effeminate face of thine, doth
better become the foldes, and the sheepe-coates, or
the Court, and the prefence of fayre ladyes, then
the feild of <hi>Wolues,</hi> of <hi>Lyons,</hi> or of men, more terrible
then theſe. But thou art deſirous of noveltyes, to
ſee, and be ſeene, and here thou art come too

               <hi>His Relation:</hi> a brother, &amp; elder brother, even the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>

him:<note place="margin">Gen. 49. 3</note> 
               <hi>[Prior in donis, major in imperio.</hi> For not only the

<hi>God,</hi> as his parte, to be a perpetuall type, and figure
of <hi>Christ</hi> our King, and Governour, till he came in
the flesh; But alſo, amongſt all <hi>Nations,</hi> the rule of a
famil, or countrey, was confer'd vpon the eldeſt:
Vntill there were <hi>Kings,</hi> they were in ſtead of ſuch,
and when there were <hi>Kings,</hi> either they were choſen
out of theſe, or theſe were their ſubſtitutes, in ſuch
familyes, and places, where they reſided. Now <hi>Ishai</hi>
being a very olde man, and noted for ſuch in the
dayes of <hi>Saul,</hi> as wee ſee at the 12. <hi>verſe of this Chapter,</hi>
the care, both of houſe holde goverment, and of

And therefore <hi>David</hi> doth not anſwer him, as
<hi>Cain</hi> anſwers <hi>God,</hi> Gen 4. <hi>Am I my brothers keeper?</hi> what
haue you to doe with me, am I your shepheard? as

perſon, how much he regard's his admonition,
as alſo making an <hi>Apologie</hi> for him ſelfe, &amp; glauncing

not ſee the apparant cauſe at this time, enforcing

            <p>The occaſion of this diſcourſe, and argument,

The Army of <hi>Iſraell,</hi> and the Army of the <hi>Philistins,</hi>
having lyen longe in the feilde, and <hi>Ishai,</hi> having
in the Army, three of his Sonnes following <hi>Saul;</hi>
the olde man longing to heare how they did, and
deſirous to ſend them ſome fresh victualls to
releiue them, as alſo to procure for them the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of their <hi>Captayne,</hi> ſend <hi>David</hi> to viſite them, to
redeeme their pledge, and to ſalute their <hi>Captayne</hi>
with a preſent of ten fresh cheeſes, <hi>v.</hi> 17. 18. He, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
early to the Campe, finde's both the Armyes
ſet in array, ready to joyne in fight, and withall hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
a great shout, ſuch as they vſe to giue at the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:24673:11"/>
firſt onſet. The young man bring hardy (though
litle) and deſirous to be one in the number that
should fight for his Country, and religion, and asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to looke on, and giue ayme, whylſt others
vnderwent the hazarde, &amp; heate of the day; leaue's
the things which he brought with the <hi>wagon-maiſter,</hi>
and made all the haſthe coulde to reach the armye
before they reached each other: Comming thither,
he finds things in great diſtraction, by reaſon of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah,</hi>
a mighty Champion of the <hi>Philiſtins,</hi> who ſtood
boaſting againſt the whole armye of <hi>Iſraell,</hi> challend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
and deſyring an able and equal Oppoſite to be
ſent out to him. To this <hi>Bravado</hi> he adds blaſphemy
agaynſt <hi>God,</hi> and dishonour and diſgrace to the <hi>King:</hi>
He beholde's the pride and inſolency of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenish
army out of the confidence they had in
their vnmatchable Champion, and withall he ſee's
the baſe feare and cowardiſe of his owne Nation,
whoſe courage was quenched with the brauery of
one man: How then (thinks he) it is likelie that
they should ſtand agaynſt many? agaynſt all? To
behold this, his hart burnes within him; <hi>Zeale</hi> to <hi>God,
allegeance</hi> to his prince, <hi>loue, and dutye</hi> to his Country,
make's him inquiſitiue, what this shoulde meane,
how it shoulde happen that ſoe <hi>many</hi> shoulde be a
frayde of one, or that one shoulde dare to affront ſo
many: Thus at length his priuate thoughts breake's
forth into wordes: <hi>What</hi> (ſayth he, to the ſtanders by
who gaped, &amp; gazed vppon the <hi>Gyant</hi> and fled at his
words, at his ſight, as men frighted and out of their
witts) what shall <hi>be done to the man that killeth this Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtim,
and taketh away the shame from Iſraell? They anſwer, to
him that killeth him, the King will giue great riches: and will
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:24673:12"/>
giue his daughter, yea &amp; make his fathers houſe free in Iſraell</hi>
Perhaps theſe promiſes were the immaginations &amp;
pratlings of the people, the vnderhand whiſperings
of policye, to ſtirre vp ſome mans courage to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
the combat. For we neither heare theſe things
publiquely proclyamed, nor repeated, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,

               <hi>David</hi> had performed what he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke,

overbeare's his diſcourſe, how he, like an able Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion,

whoſe match the whole hoaſt afforded not, check's

            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> therefore, beholding all this with ſorrow,
and ſeeing ſuch a generall diſpoſition in the whole
army to faynt and fly, rather then to fight, or as
beaſts are, in droues, driuen to be butchered, when
being ſingle and out of the crowde they woulde

<hi>what haue I now done? Is there not a cauſe?</hi>

            <p>From the <hi>Manner</hi> of ſpeaking wee deſcend to the
<hi>Matter</hi> or ſubject of <hi>Davids</hi> ſpeech; which, in fewe but

cauſe of his famous attempt, &amp; atcheiuement
following immediatly after.</p>
            <p>For whilſt he ſayth <hi>Is their not a cauſe?</hi> he take'es the
cauſe as graunted and evident enough. Let vs then
labour to finde it out; for all actions (and ſoe this)
are warrantable, or wicked, as they haue an evident
cauſe to juſtifie or condemne them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>CAVSES</hi> are either <hi>ordinary,</hi> or <hi>extraordinary:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thoſe which we call <hi>ordinary,</hi> are all ſecond cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
which are readie at hande, lying open to the
eye of vulgar obſervation, and proceeding by a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall
&amp; common courſe of <hi>Nature. Extraordinarie</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
are either wholy hid, or farther remooved; ſo
that they are not ſeene <hi>at all,</hi> or, (at leaſt) not <hi>by all.</hi>
The higheſt among'ſt <hi>ordinarie</hi> cauſes (for wee
ſpeake of that <hi>ſpheare</hi> wherein the rule of man is
wholy buſied, and taken vp) is the <hi>ſovereigne,</hi> or
<hi>ſupreame</hi> Power, and all other powers <hi>ſubordinate</hi> to it.
This hath <hi>conveniency</hi> and <hi>vtility</hi> as the moſt proper
end of it's operation and ayme. For though it be
<hi>convenient</hi> &amp; <hi>profitable</hi> to haue ſuch ſubordinate power
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:24673:15"/>
ſetled, yet it is not of abſolute <hi>neceſſity</hi> that wee haue
them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Extraordinary</hi> cauſes, in this claſſe, or forme, haue
<hi>Necesſity</hi> for their proper and direct ende, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
onely to worke when there is defect of opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the ordinary cauſes: as <hi>Phyſick</hi> is adminiſtred
to helpe decayed nature, and expell malignant hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor.
Thus when <hi>Saul,</hi> the ſupreameſt amongſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
cauſes in the common wealth of <hi>Iſraell,</hi> is
ſlack in his office; <hi>God</hi> rayſeth vp <hi>David</hi> to quicken

and through indulgence ſuffers his ſonnes to abuſe
their office; <hi>God</hi> rayſeth vp <hi>Samuel</hi> to provoke him
to more dilligence. And thus, at all tymes, in defect
of ordinary paſtors, <hi>God</hi> hath rayſed vp prophets to
teach his people, and to publish his judgements o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly
and playnely,<note place="margin">It is (as I haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) very-vncertayn whether ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes were ever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded on no, by the King; becauſe wee never ſee them repeated, challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, or per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>formed by Saule to David af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke wrougt</note> though with the perill of their

            <p>If any man object (therfore) that the reward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
by the King <hi>ver.</hi> 25. was the principall
cauſe that excited <hi>David</hi> to vndertake this quarrell,
I doubt not to ſay they are much deceiued: For
though intiſements to vertue, and indowments for
vertue doe well; and though men come ſeldome to
the markett, where nothing but bloud, and blowes
are to be bought, and ſolde; yet true fortitude is
not <hi>mercenary,</hi> nor coulde all thoſe words, make our

combat, except a greater neceſſity call him
forth, then prayſe, or profitt, or pleaſure, or prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
It muſt not be an <hi>ordinary,</hi> but <hi>extraordinary</hi>
cauſe, therefore, that moue's this <hi>extraordinary</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:
and what other thing coulde that be, then the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:24673:15"/>
preſent daunger wherein he beheld the church and
ſtate involved, together with the deſperate ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the <hi>King,</hi> and Kingdomes honor. Hee ſee's
all theſe in hazard to receiue either a totall over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe,
or (at leaſt) a violent and vnrecoverable
blowe, by this <hi>Blaſphemer:</hi> For will it not ſtagger true
beleeuers when they ſee the enemy braue <hi>God</hi> (as it
were) to his face, and goe away vnpunished? The
wicked then encourage themſelues in infidelity,
and with open mouth deride, and diſcreditt the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
miracles of <hi>God</hi> ſoe much ſpoken of. For if <hi>God</hi>
doth not every day create new worlds, or confound
olde enemyes, or produce new miracles, man will
not beleeue that ever he made the world, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
the rebellious race of idolatrbus <hi>Gyants,</hi> or
ever did a miracle, or perhaps ſcarce thinke there
is a <hi>God</hi> to doe ſuch thinges; At leaſt, that he is not
the <hi>true God,</hi> except he marcheth away with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour.
For proſperity and externall glory ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicheth,
and dazeleth the eyes and judgements of
mortall men, as they cannot ſuſpect guilded fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shood,
nor embrace ragged truth. And therefore
<hi>Rabshakeh,</hi> comming agaynſt <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde
of <hi>Sanacherib King of Ashur,</hi> elevated with his
former victories, crye's out with an open and jmpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent

they trust and put confidence that they doe not preſently render
themſelues to the mercy of his Master? where (ſayth he) is the
God of Hamah? and of Arpad? where is the God of Sepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruaim?
or how haue they deliuered Samaria out of my hands?
whoe is he among all the Gods of theſe lands that hath deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
their Country out of my hand, that the Lord should deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:24673:16"/>
receiued no anſwere, till</hi> God ſtopt his mouth with a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle:
For all then, and there, were colde, benumde,
and ſilent, as perſons decayed in ſpirit, and fitted
for that defection and forreigne Captiuity, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
which not long after followed.</p>
            <p>But our Champions heart burne's more hott in

<hi>what haue I now done? Is there not a cauſe?</hi> And
thus much of the cauſe or matter here mentioned
to shew, that it was a cauſe of neceſſity which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peld'
his vndertaking for <hi>Is there not a cauſe?</hi> hauing
reference to nothing els then to the publique pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill

a cauſe more then ſufficient, to compell him that
is a true member of the myſticall body of <hi>Christ,</hi> to
shew his Spirituall life by ſtrugling for the generall
liberty. The concluſions therefore from hence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,

               <p>APriuate Perſon is hee that hath noe direct or
publique calling to the action he vndertake's:
In which ſenſe a publique perſon in one kind, may
be a priuate perſon in an other reſpect. <hi>Aron</hi> is a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blique
perſon to ſacrifice, but not to rule, and
<hi>Vzziah</hi> is a publique perſon to gouerne, but not to
ſacrifice. A magiſtrate is a publique perſon, but not
for all actions: for if he take vpon him to adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Sacraments, he therein becomes a priuate
perſon. Nay when he doeth any acte of Iuſtice wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hout
a Law, he then laye's by the prerogatiue, and
dignity of a publique perſon, and acts the parte of
a priuate man. Becauſe the lawe is the inſtrument,
&amp; ſword of the publique magiſtrate, without which
to ſtrike is to <hi>Tyrannize,</hi> and without which, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
in any puplique buſines, is to become priuate.
Thus wee ſee <hi>Mayors,</hi> &amp; other ſubordinate officers,
who are shadowes &amp; types of the ſupreame, goeing
abroad without their <hi>Swords &amp; Maces</hi> (the enſignes
of their offices) become priuate (for the preſent
time) till they aſſume thoſe types of their authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
agayne, which ſerue as publique and notable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
commanding all men to take notice of
them, and to obey them as publique executors of
the lawes. Soe the King ſaieth moſt excellently, in
the beginning of his ſpeach made to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the 26. of March, 1621. <hi>that the end why Kings

                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:24673:17"/>
Theſe are the executors of the law, which is the
will of the ſtate, wherof they are heads; and when
they doe their owne wills againſt, and not with the
will of the ſtate (that is the <hi>law</hi>) then they become
private perſons in thoſe perticulars, becauſe they

               <p>Now every man whither priuate or publique, is
a member of the <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> wherein hee liue's,
and ſoe hath noe <hi>power of his owne body,</hi> to diſpoſe of it
this or that way, eſpecially to hazard it in a ſingle

high excellent, &amp; emnient the perſon is, the leſſe

to hazard his perſon in a ſingle <hi>Duell,</hi> without mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt

               <p>WEe ſee in nature, that when the eye waxeth
blynd, the hand, grope's, the foote beat's for
way, and the eare, by liſtening, ſeeke's to guide the
body right, and to ſupplie the place of an eye; Soe
the eye (where men are deafe, and dumbe borne)
apprehend's by ſignes, and ſends back her owne
conceptions, by a viſible kind of language. One
member ſupplie's the place of an other in ſervice of
the whole body; neither doth the head (where rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
reſide's) find fault with the comunitie of partes,
and exchange of their portions. The mouth in caſe
of neceſſitie, think's noe ſcorne to become a draught
and purging place to the ſtomack by vomit: neither
doth the ſtomack (in caſe of neceſſitie) refuſe meate
that is ſent vp by gliſters. Nature makes vſe of any
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:24673:20"/>
parte in any office, for preſervation of the whole
man from ruine. In the reaſonable faculties of the
ſoule, the jmagmation ſtand's in ſtead of memorie,
by begetting newe <hi>Ideas</hi> in braines that be inclyned
to be ouer-hott, and drye, and the memorie ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie's
the defect of judgment, by following former
preſidents, where the brayne inclyne's to ouermuch
moyſture; and all parts bringing intelligenc to the
reaſonable ſoule (the <hi>Governeſſe</hi> of all) shee reject's
none before examination, nor cenſure's any for
doing the office which belong's to an other, whilſt
the other is defectiue, and this doth not neglect it's
proper function. Soe that the ſoule hauing neede of
all, maks vſe of all for the comon benefit: In-ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as if the foote by tripping giue's her warning
of that which the eye should haue ſeene, she doth
not therefore neglect to looke out, becauſe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
come's from a blynd guide, but therefore
she looke's out, to ſee if the foote ſay true or noe, &amp;
ſoe let's the eye ſee it's owne fault in the dilligence
of the foote. The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> vſeth this argument to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade

euery member partak's with the head and whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 26.</note> in paine or pleaſure, in houor or dishonor, the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore
it concern's euery member, to looke to the
preſervation both of themſelues in perticuler, and
of others in generall. Becauſe noe member can ſay
they are abſolute in themſelues, and haue noe needs
of another. The eye doth not ſee for it ſelf alone,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:24673:20"/>
but for the foote, and whole body. It concerne's
the <hi>Eye</hi> therefore to watch, that if the <hi>eare</hi> (by
accident) should be negligent or lett ſlip a remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keable
obſervation, which concernes neceſſarily
the whole body, that the <hi>eye</hi> might be in ſtead of an
<hi>eare,</hi> and giue notice to the ſoule by ſome viſible
motion. And thus wee ſee the <hi>eye</hi> ſteadfaſtly faſtned
vpon the ſpeaker, or any other object, keepes the
imagination from wandring, and makes the <hi>eare</hi>
more attentiue to the voyce, and apprehenſiue of
the meaning. And ſoe, whilſt the <hi>eye</hi> takes a napp, or
in the darke, when it cannot ſee, it concernes the
<hi>eare</hi> towatch for it ſelfe, for the <hi>eye,</hi> &amp; for the whole

As wee ſee in the elements though nothing be more
oppoſed then the fyre and water, yet they are mixt
in the ayre which is hott and moiſt; the fyre is hott
and dry, and the ayre is hott and moiſt: Now though
the ayre and fyre be diuerſe, yea meere contraries,
as the one is dry, and the other moiſt, yet they are
eaſely married together as they are both hott; Soe
the water is cold and moiſt, and the earth cold and
dry; as the one is moiſt, and thother dry, they haue
neede of each other, and yet they fall out and fight;
but as they are both cold, they eaſely agree and
are compounded in one body. And thus it is in the
members of the humane body, compoſed of theſe
elements, and thus is it in the Church and Comon-wealth,
which is a myſticall and politique body com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:24673:21"/>
of theſe men; Now therefore, hauing thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
the comunity of the parts even in nature, let
vs looke into a few examples, following this <hi>reaſon</hi> or
<hi>law of nature,</hi> and there ſee how actions, (otherwiſe
queſtionable) are warranted, and juſtified by neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,
when they reſpect the publique.</p>
               <p>The King of Sodome rebells againſt <hi>Chedorlaomer</hi>
King of Elam;<note place="margin">Gen. 14. 4.</note> It is vnlawfull to rebell, vnlawfull to
aſſiſt rebells, yet <hi>Lot</hi> takes his part, and is taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner;
<hi>Abraham</hi> thinks it noe injuſtice to joyne in
confederacy with this rebelling King, but that it is
lawfull to make an invaſiue warre to reſcue his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Lot.</hi> The reaſon is, nature bynds him to it, and
if hee should neglect his duty in this caſe he were
worſe then an infidell. Nay religion bynds him to
it, and a righteous family calls for helpe. Herein <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
though he aſſailes, doth but defend, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the law of nature; for if they had not firſt
inuaded the Church, and taken <hi>Lot, Abraham</hi> had
ſate ſtill, but now his aſſault is taken as a defence, for
otherwiſe the Church, &amp; faith of the church, could
not be defended.</p>
               <p>The Church is in diſtreſſe, &amp; in hazard to receiue
a blowe by this meanes: Hee is noe living parte
of the Church, that ſuffers any parte to fall, whileſt
his hand can vpholde it. I had rather pull the houſe

ſtayned, nor the edge bated, with any other ſpott
or ſtroke, then the touch of innocent blood. But
that (like as <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> eats into ſteele, or as the
blood of <hi>Goates</hi> ſoftens <hi>Diamonds)</hi> doth indeede ſof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
the mettall, and ſoe turnes the edge of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
that it cuts not at all, or only cuts the abuſer
and perverter of it. This wee ſee in <hi>Abraham</hi> who
after this very warre (and <hi>only then)</hi> is bleſſed by <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedesk,</hi>
the King, and Preift of peace. Yea <hi>Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deck</hi>
accepts the tythe of the ſpoiles, &amp; by his accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,

for had the goods beene ill gotten (as they
muſt needs bee were the warre vnlawfull) that <hi>King
of juſtice</hi> would not haue pertaken, nor receaued any

approues the action, and warrants our imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;

But who can know, whether an other man hath the

               <p>To conclude this point, though the actions of all

it probable, whileſt I conſider the weaknes, and
proclivity of frayle man, to take part with ſtrong
iniquity of the preſent time, againſt ſingle, and

<hi>Eliab</hi> in this reproofe, ſeconded ſome other great

preſent ſtate of things, and the cowardice of the

(like age,) is loth to looke in a glaſſe, for
feare of beholding it's owne wrinckles, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formityes)
or judging it vnfit that vnexperien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced

after matters of ſtate, or affaires of warre;
or that a shepheards lad, should ſtep beyond the
reach of his <hi>Sheep-hooke,</hi> and out of the ſent, or
ſmellof his <hi>Tarr-boxe,</hi> thought to quench this fiery
ſparke by a timely reproofe. But this water ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke's
it burne feyrcer, and flame brighter, for
hypocricy may, but ſincerity cannot, be thus
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:24673:34"/>
diverted from a direct courſe; ſince conſtancy, and
perſeverance alone, is that which diſcovoreth an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall,
fayned, and forced apparance, from a true

will continue without ſtayning.</p>
               <p>But perhaps neither ignorance, nor aſſentation,
but envye moved <hi>Eliab</hi> to reprove <hi>David</hi> in this,
being loth that his younger brother should be his
elder in honour; for he ſees this action would every
way tend to his prayſe: If he failed, yet to offer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
was honorable: if he fell, yet to dye ſoe, was
better then to liue otherwiſe: if he came of vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſafe,
and vpon equall tearmes, it was admirable: if he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
(as that could not be jmagined) the honour
that he should reape thereby, (beſides the reward)
was ineſtimable: whileſt he should remaine vnpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raleld.
Theſe ſeeds of envye are ſometimes ſowen,

becauſe vice hates vertue in whatſoever ſubject he

For this cauſe cowardes cannot abide another man
should be couragious; nor prophame perſons, that

action that is done, and ſay it ought not to be done,
becauſe they dare not doe it, and therefore it is faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and punishable, becauſe they did it not. I feare
that <hi>Eliab</hi> whileſt he challengeth his brother of this

May be juſtly taxed of malice and envye himſelfe:
as <hi>Aristippus</hi> tould <hi>Diogenes, thou reprehendeſt me of pride

               </p>
               <p>Not to reward ſuch is improvidence; <hi>Legibus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſita</hi>
(ſaith <hi>Cicero) ſunt ſupplicia viris, praemia virtutibus.</hi>
Actions are either ſuch as ought to be punished, or
rewarded, (for to be pardoned is a kind of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
and the lawes reſpect both. Now if this action
of <hi>Davids</hi> be not to be punished, becauſe he doth
therein nothing, but what proceeds from a ſupera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundant
meaſure of loue and duty to <hi>God,</hi> and to
his King and Country, then ought he to be rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
For as the royall ſcepter belongs to <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> to
ſtretch out in mercy toward <hi>Eſther,</hi> and the ſword to
ſtrike <hi>Haman</hi> in juſtice; ſoe alſo doth it belong to the
King, to watch, and read, and receiue information
of <hi>Mordocay</hi> his good ſervice, &amp; to remember, that
though it were regiſtred, it was not rewarded. As it
were injuſtice for this to punish <hi>Mordocay,</hi> ſoe is it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>providence,
not to rewarde him; for whileſt wee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect
ſuch as benefit, or endeavor to benefit the
Church and Common-wealth, wee shew our ſelues
vnthankefull to <hi>God,</hi> who rayſeth vp the inſtrument,
and vnthankefull to man, whoe was made the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:24673:35"/>
And ſoe to be moſt vnworthy of that benefit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
For he that is the meanes of ſaving the Princes life,
deſerves all that the Prince can doe for him; but he
that preſerves the life of the ſtate, or indevours to
doe it, preſerves both the Princes life, and his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
alſo, and more then that, all that his life and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
depends on, which is the preſervation of his
peoples liberty. This <hi>David</hi> here doth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
merit's whatſoever is propounded, though rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of ſtate (that myſtery of iniquity) delayde him in
all theſe points, and deludes his expectation, as it
vſeth to delay, and delude the expectation of the
beſt deſervers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Saul</hi> yet (if wee may build vpon the private diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of the private ſouldiers) propounds a reward
to any that performes this ſervice, viz; <hi>Great riches:</hi>
for he that should doe ſuch an acte as this, might
want wealth but was ſtored with native worth, and
nobility enough. For either titular <hi>Nobility</hi> was then
noe reward, or ells <hi>Fortitude</hi> was then the only <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>his daughter to wife:</hi> for he could not
place her better, she should receiue the addition
of honor by this marriage, rather then parte with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
Noble blood not then ran in ignoble veynes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>make his fathers houſe free in Iſraell:</hi> for he
well deſerved it, that by this act should make all
<hi>Iſraell</hi> free. Soe a Mouſe may deſerve liberty of a
Lion, and a ſubject more then a ſoveraigne can give.
And this is the reaſon (perhaps) that he went, and
others too often, goe vnrewarded, except it be with
injuryes and reproches: becauſe devilish policy
ſaith men may ſupererrogate, or deſerve too much,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:24673:35"/>

               <p>But this is a blind and beaſtly <hi>Paradoxe</hi> to quench

neither can a ſubject detract from his ſuperior by
doing honorably; ſince he is both the center, and
circumference of the Common-wealth, and (in the

and growes greater by their greatnes, as the body

whoſe happy hands were made (by <hi>Gods</hi> mercy)

ſince, in ſpeaking <hi>forbidden truth,</hi> without feare, or

a witneſſe, and evidence, of the truth of that ſervice,
beyond the power of Envy, Suſpicion, or Increduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

               <p>Let none thinke themſelues neglected that (from

skip to him, who was a long time held to be <hi>the child

our land for the future, when he went forth, the
whole continent ſeemed ſoule-les; recovering the
ſwound, wee ſought him whom our hearts loued, and
found him not; wee were beaten for ſeeking him,
and might not complaine. Hee ſeemed to turne his
back vpon vs, as if he had deſired a new loue, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning
our deſires, teares, prayers. Our hearts
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:24673:38"/>
were fild with jealouſy and indignation, even to that
height, that we were tempted by <hi>fraylety,</hi> and <hi>fury</hi> to
reject him, that had wholy caſt vs of. But <hi>loue</hi> and <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
would none of theſe breaches; his <hi>loue,</hi> our <hi>dutyes</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waked,
and wept, and were ſoone reconciled. Hee
returned <hi>alone,</hi> and shewed by his ſingle returning
<hi>alone,</hi> that he loued vs, and found none abroad ſoe
loving him as wee did. Wee welcomed his returne
with the joyfull shout that attends a Prince from
the mouthes of his faithfulleſt ſervants; and this was
ſtill the foote of our ſonge of thankſgiving, <hi>God be
prayſed that he is come home ALONE.</hi>
               </p>

large experience of <hi>Gods</hi> mercy, and knew his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtyes

in this match, when wee could ſee nothing elſe

Majeſty knew better then wee, whome he had to

it would fall heauily vpon his honour, herein to be
miſled or abuſed; ſince he ſtood <hi>alone,</hi> except the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
of ſuch hollow trunkes, as he choſe and vſed

the advantage of this match was like to be, and what
his Majeſtyes aymes were, what was the dowry pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,
whoſe price and value should recompence
all theſe hazards.</p>
               <p>For <hi>mony,</hi> it could not be any ſumme; for <hi>Spayne</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Strength by alliance</hi> could not be the ayme, ſince we

that would vſe our aſſiſtance to that end, for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment

               <p>For the <hi>reſtoring of the Palatinate,</hi> that was too poore
a conceite, for our hopes to ſtoope to: ſince when
the treaty was farre advanced, at leaſt on our ſide,
(as his Majeſty beleeued, and taught vs to beleeue)
the quarrell was not then begun with the <hi>Emperour,</hi>
much leſſe proſecuted, as afterward, with the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi>
force, and fury; and ſo that could not be in our
eye, as an object to ſatiſfy our thirſt for this match,
and for the portion expected by it. And wee had
hope that this treaty would haue ſtayed, and turned
the tyde, and torrent, of thoſe violent proceedings,
which fell out in the <hi>interim,</hi> and countermaunded
<hi>Spinola,</hi> (thereby to indeare our alliance, and to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
how ſerviceable, and profitable it would be to

ſteale vpon our ſecurity, and credulity, and by open

to take enough from the ſiſter, to make a convenient

               <p>Some therefore (who could not ſwallow theſe

of the Indyes, or both. Others more probably

For ſince his returne hee hath done the greateſt

who before ſeemed to be halfe abandoned to his

               <p>I should now conclude this gratious, and glorious

               <p>His Majeſtyes entrance into <hi>England,</hi> was as <hi>sho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:24673:47"/>
he might haue beene ours by choice, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong

ſince, hath beene only vnhappy in this, that
he hath over-loved peace, which is the happineſſe of
all ſtates, but hath beene our affliction. It may bee,
becauſe <hi>God</hi> himſelfe will <hi>haue no peace with the wicked,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eſ. 48. 22.</note>
much leſſe permit his ſervants to haue it. <hi>God,</hi> and
<hi>Baal,</hi> cannot dwell together. Or it may bee, becauſe
we <hi>croſt the will of God, with humane wiſdome,</hi> and would
needes haue peace, when he cald vs to warre. Or it
may bee, that wee <hi>ſought for that happineſſe here, which is
reſerved for the ſaints here-after:</hi> to liue in peace within
the <hi>militant Church,</hi> as the ſaints doe in the <hi>trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant.</hi>
Theſe, ſome, or all of them, may be a cauſe
why that bleſſing of peace, is turned to a curſe, to
weaken vs, which makes others ſtronger; to impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
vs, which makes others richer; to devid vs, which
vnites others: for woes, wants, and warres, abound

with their ſubjects, <hi>policy,</hi> and <hi>reſervednes,</hi> with ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers:
<hi>Chriſt</hi> ſpake to the <hi>Iewes</hi> in parables, but to his
owne, it <hi>was giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to know the myſtery of the Kingdome of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now, as if all before had not beene enough
to provoke a peaceable Prince to a juſt warre, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
what <hi>God</hi> hath permitted theſe fyre brands, and
boutefewes of Chriſtendome to attempt, by accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the Prince, the Duke, and whole ſtate of <hi>Treaſon,</hi>
Was there ever ſuch a practiſe jmagined? of what
do they preſume that dare be thus bolde, impudent,
impious? Is it of their owne power? Noe aſſuredly,
for they are in ours, whilſt they doe it. Is it of their
party here able to back them, and beare them out?
of our patience to ſuffer them whatſoever they doe?
or proclivenes to credit them whatſoever they
ſay? I know not whether they build vpon theſe, or
other groundes, of this I am ſure the plot equalls,
or exceede's the <hi>Gunpowder treaſon;</hi> becauſe, although,
that aymed at the lives of all, yet it did not touch
their honors; this ayme's at life, and honor of the
beſt, yea, of all, to ſet father, againſt the ſonne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the
ſovereigne againſt his ſubjects, one hand againſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:24673:48"/>
And to what end? that they in the meane
time may diſtract affavres, hinder reſolutions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
hearts, and hands, from ſuccouring the Kinges
children, and freinds, ready to perish by their Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannyes;
that they may arme their owne pernicious
faction, with pretence to be a <hi>guarde</hi> for the Kings
perſon, and ſoe, ſince they cannot rayſe a rebellion,
and devide the Prince, and people, that their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes
may enter to ſtickle betwixt them (as they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavored
in <hi>Spayne</hi>) now they would devide the <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
and the <hi>ſonne,</hi> and cleaue this knot by a wedge
of the ſame wood, I meane by the <hi>Hiſpaniolized,</hi> and
<hi>Romanized,</hi> natures in <hi>England.</hi> Since this, (by <hi>Gods</hi>
grace) hath fayled, I know not to what they can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
except it be to accuſe the King himſelfe, which
they will not fayle to doe, if it may fit their turne,
vnleſſe his Majeſty do juſtice vpon them, and make
an honorable preſident for all poſterity, that <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours</hi>
preſume not to doe, what their <hi>Maſters</hi> dare
not, and for which, even Kinges themſelues being
in foreigne Provinces, were liable to accounte. Wee
read how zealous <hi>David</hi> was in redeeming the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
of his owne <hi>Ambaſſadours,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Sa. 10. 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> becauſe they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,
and revenging theſe indignityes offered to
them vnworthily: Had they merrited evill, he
would never haue protected them, but doing their
dutyes, his honor was ingaged in them, &amp; for them.
And if he did thus for a few of his ſervants, what
would he haue done for all his ſervants, yea, for all
his ſubjects,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 24<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 17.</note> for <hi>whoſe ſafety he offers his life?</hi> Nay what
would he haue done for them, and for his ſonne, his

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:24673:49"/>
                  <hi>ſubjects,</hi> his <hi>ſonne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now therefore, to cloſe this wandring diſcourſe,
(mighty Sovereigne) ſince by thy ſervant, by thy
ſonne, by thy ſelfe, mouth to mouth, thou haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
thy fore-paſt actions, and paſſions, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
intents towards vs, and wee (with all the world)
are witneſſes of thy integrity; draw thy ſword, and
cut aſſunder this <hi>Gordions knot,</hi> which all thy wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
cannot vnty. And as that painter by caſting
his penſile (in a rage) from him, made (by chance)
ſuch a fome for a mad Dog, as he could not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
light vpon by art, &amp; induſtry: ſo <hi>God</hi> may bleſſe
thy hand, that going boldely on, whilſt he call's thee,
and leade's thee, and following him in ſimplicity, and
truth, without reliance, truſt, or dependancy, vpon
the ſecurity of thy owne head, or arme, thou ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yeſt
happily ariue, at that period, thou wouldeſt bee
at, and force that reſtitution, and peace, which thou
canſt neither beg, nor buy.</p>
               <p>There is nothing to feare but the <hi>Ieſuits</hi> hand, let
thy hand therefore fright them, and their adhaerents
farre from thee, out of thy Dominions. Hee that
ſtands vpon ſimple defenſe, ſtands but halfe armed,
nor altogether ſoe; but he that ſtands to offende,
doth (<hi>by that posture</hi>) ſtand ready for all aſſayes, both
guarding himſelfe, &amp; putting him to his guard, who
(like <hi>Ishmaël</hi>) hath his hand againſt every man. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
how thou art incircled with myriads of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and millions of <hi>Saints,</hi> &amp; <hi>Angells; God</hi> ſends theſe
to defend thee, and ſecure thy doubts. Looke vpon
the <hi>Prince,</hi> thy bleſſed Sonne, the <hi>Queene of Bohemis,</hi>
thy diſtreſſed Daughter, ſee how fruitfull shee is.
And <hi>thoſe children of hers, joyntly,</hi> are like oliue branches
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:24673:49"/>
round about thy table, a hedge of quickſet round
about thy walkes, a wall of flesh and blood, and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
round about thy life; and <hi>each of them ſeverally</hi> is
an armour, a guard, of thine. Who dares touch thee,
that conſiders who is thy ſucceſſor? and who dare
touch him, that conſiders her that followes? and
thus ſucceſſively, if malice be infinite, thy ſecurity is
noe leſſe.</p>
               <p>Thus they being thy guard, thou muſt needes be
theirs; they preſerving thy life next vnder <hi>God</hi> (for
beleeue it, <hi>O King!</hi> it had beene, and were now, worſe
with thee elſe, then with <hi>Henry 4. of Fance</hi>) thou muſt
needes preſerue their eſtates, with thy vttermoſt
power; and ſo protecting each other interchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
<hi>God</hi> that hath gratiouſly rayſed you for them, &amp;
them for you, will protect you <hi>all,</hi> with his omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
arme. And if any cavilling Enemy, that dares
not touch your perſon, shall dare yet to attempt
your honor, and fame, for falling from <hi>Spayne,</hi> and
ſayling a new courſe, you haue that buckler of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi>
to hold out againſt them, in defence of your

not a cauſe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus I haue brought the <hi>Prince,</hi> and <hi>Duke of Buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kingham</hi>
