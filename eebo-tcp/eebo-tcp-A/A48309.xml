            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Puritan Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F thou art such a one as doest confesse thy
selfe a Puritan (as the name is now unjustly
used) thou wilt soon find in this short Tract,
that my indevour has been to do thee right,
but not to humor thee; to take off unjust aspersions from
thee, but not to insinuate by flattery into thee. An Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dexter
I would not be in two contrary factions, by
seeking to please both; neither would I be a Neuter, if I
could avoyde it: but in things where I dissent, I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from both sides, rather then from that which I
think the truth. I shall not use the word Puritan facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
as if all Puritans were alike to be imbraced: but
cautiously, as if that difference and contrariety might
happen amongst Puritans in England, as did once
amongst the Disciples in our Saviours owne Schoole.
Charitie urges me not to censure any man in particular
for an hypocrite, yet wisdome teaches me not to free all
men in generall from being hypocrites: such charity
may well stand and agree together with such wisdome,
and such wisdome with such charitie; but if I doe not at
all scruple any mans integrity, this necessitates me not
therefore to ascribe an infallibilitie: for if I can easily
yeeld to hope and think well of all Puritans, yet it ought
not to be expected that I should yeeld my consent to all
Puritans in all things. I am free and open in declaring
my opinion aswell against the rigorous and necessary
urging of Presbyteriall as Episcopall Government in
all places, and at all times; but I relye upon proofe not
<pb facs="tcp:61021:3"/>
meere phansie, and my proofe being enervated by my
clearer judgement, it will be a pleasure to me to retract.
Variety of opinion and understanding (some say) has
place amongst those glorious spirits in Heaven, amongst
whom no other kind of discord can have place: and even
the Apostles themselves though inspired by God, yet
when they spake not by inspiration, they were not desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to lead captive the beliefes of other lesse-knowing
men. Heat and acrimony amongst such as dissent in
opinion has done more mischiefe in the Church of God,
then any thing that I can imagine besides; and certainly
'tis not the meere love of truth, but some other sinister
respect that workes thus violently in the minds of men
so naturally dimme, as we all are. For why should I burn
with indignation against another, because he is lesse un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
then I am? or why should I so farre pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
upon my selfe, if I think I am liable to errour, as
well as other men? can the meere love of knowledge
make me abhorre ignorance more in another then in my
selfe? or make me arrogate more freedome from errour
to my selfe, then to other men? Sure, truth has more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity
with charity then so, and charitie with humility.
For my part, I doe acknowledge my selfe not onely sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to much ignorance, but to much scandalous offence
too; my greatest enemie shall not charge me of more
staines, then I will my selfe; I will confesse my self the
chiefe of sinners, and that not only in regard of sinnes
past, as perhaps Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did, but also in regard of my
present sinfull condition; but certainely since sin and
ignorance are such things as cleave radically to all
men, and must be accounted <hi>sortis humanae;</hi> therefore
to beare mutuall reproofes, and to forbeare all bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and censure, ought to be professed as vertues, and
to be accounted <hi>Sortis Christianae.</hi> And since I my
<pb facs="tcp:61021:3"/>
selfe notwithstanding all my other defects<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> do not glory
in them, but confesse them to my shame, and since I doe
not maligne the graces of God in rigid Puritans, but
rather rejoyce thereat, I am persuaded, howsoever I
appeare to the eye of God, no man living ought to despise
me, much lesse to expunge me out of the booke of life. If
God does not give me so much grace as he does thee,
wilt thou say, He gives me not that which he accounts
sufficient? and if I am not in this or that so unblame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
as thou art, wilt thou say, my grace generally is not
equall with thine? if thou exceedest me in all other
vertues, and yet art by me exceeded in humility alone,
wilt thou upon this proceede to censure me? Puritans
have not made themselves more inexcusable by any
thing then by condemning other men: for though they
see not as God sees, yet they will often undertake to
judge as God ought to judge: and in this they have not
been greater enemies to themselves, then to the whole
state of Pietie and Religion. It does not appeare to the
contrary, but that the Pharisee in the Gospell, of whom
our Saviour put his case, might be a good man, and his
cause might be good to praise God for not leaving him
to the scandalous excesses of some other men: but when
he would undertake to judge particular men, more righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
perhaps in Gods sight then himself, we know what
judgement he received himselfe. And if it be not
lawfull to censure a Publican, much lesse will I censure
a Pharisee, except alone in that particular wherein hee
is himselfe censorious, and wherein our Saviour Christ
condemnes him: that doctrine therefore which I shall
recommend to all men both Pharisees and Publicans, is,
to be Charitable, to be Humble: to be Charitable, because
they are Christians, to be humble, because they are men.
<pb facs="tcp:61021:4"/>
The Times have lately received a very great and
wonderfull change, almost equall to that of <hi>Edw.</hi> the 6.
and yet still there is the same use of Charitie, as was
before. Lukewarmnesse that odious and nauseous bane
of Religion was hitherto decored and guilded over with
the title of Moderation: but now we are in danger to
suffer in the other extreme, for Moderation that blessed
pacificall vertue is now likely to be as much debased,
and defaced under the title of Lukewarmnesse: Both
wayes Charity is violated, both wayes Piety is opposed:
and what difference is it to Satan, if he prevaile, by
which extreme he does prevaile, whether he sinks us by
a Tempest, or confound us by a calme? For a remedy of
all mischiefes then let us embrace Charitie, and that
Charitie may dwell amongst us, let us all learne to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
despise, and abhorre our selves more, and other
men lesse hereafter.</p>

            <head>A
DISCOURSE
CONCERNING
PURITANS.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>Tis a common Maxim amongst Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,
that a State is maintained by Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusations,
but ruined by Calumnies: and
therefore (saies Marquesse <hi>Malvezzi)
Happy shall the Subjects be of that wise
Prince, which countenances Accusations,
and checks Calumnies: for the suffering
of Accusations to goe lesse in repute, and
Calumnies to get footing, hath beene the encrease of manslaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and the continuance of enmity in all ages.</hi> Many beleeve
that nothing which is done would be knowne, if this meanes
of dispersing privie calumnious speeches were not used, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
little is knowne because it is used: for falshood constantly
affirmed for truth, sometimes deceives, and when it does not,
but is knowne to be falshood, yet it forces to some suspension
of judgement, and makes us yeeld some way even to that
which we beleeve not. This is most apparant at this day in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61021:5"/>
this Kingdome in the Case of Puritans, for did accusation and
legall processe take place, few crimes would be proved against
Puritans, and did not malicious calumny prevaile, as few men
would be proved Puritans, whereas now nothing is so mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous,
which is not branded upon Puritans, and no man is so
innocent as to escape that brand. So great also is the audacity
of those which lacerate the fames of Puritans, and with so
much confidence doe they vent their obloquies, that they
which know the falsity thereof, and easily perceive that the
same aspersions are more truely due to the Autors and raisers
of them, yet they are dazeled, and driven to some doubtfull
admittance thereof. Neither could this audacity be so preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
amongst the vulgar, but that Scholars, and the greatest of
the Clergy are now become the most injurious detesters and
depravers of Puritans, having taken up in Pulpits and presses,
almost as vile and scurrilous a licence of fiction and detracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as is usuall in Play honses, Taverns, and Bordelloes. Some
men divide generally all Protestants into Puritans, and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puritans,
but I shall admit of subdivisions in both, for all men
are not alike, which either affect or disaffect, either Puritans
or Antipuritans. Antipuritans I shall thus divide. Some An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipuritans
are so tearmed, because they are no Puritans, but
such I dislike not, for I my self am neither the one nor other,
I neither merit the name of Puritan, neither doe I hate them
so as to professe my self an Antipuritan.</p>
            <p>Others are accounted Antipuritans, because they are of the
Romish Religion, and so professe themselves, but their enmity
is but a due antipathy, and as a necessary consequence of their
Religion, and such I take no notice of, I think Puritans expect
no other from them. Others again there are which are very
averse from some Puritanicall Tenets, and hold Puritans in
very many things erroneous, but yet they mean well them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and bear no hatred to the persons of Puritans, they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Puritans sound in the most and weightiest matters of
faith, they hold dissent in disputable things no ground of
malice, and they attribute no infallibility to themselves in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61021:5"/>
those things wherein they dissent: from these men I am but
little removed. The worst sort of Antipuritans, and they
which ought only to be so called, are they which bitterly hate
and persecute many good men under the name of Puritans, and
many goods things in those which are Puritans, whose antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
is to mens persons, as well as opinions, &amp; in opinions those
which are sound, as well as those which are erroneous. These
are the Antipuritans which I shall now strive to detect, whom
I now hold to be of great number and power in the State at
this day, whom we may account the chiefest causers, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curers
of all those mischiefs and plagues which now incumber
both Church and Commonwealth, and to be guilty of all
those crimes, which falsly they charge upon Puritans, being
therein like <hi>Caesars</hi> enemies which therefore onely hated him,
because they had deserved hatred from him. By such Antipuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans
is all love to goodnesse and zeal to the Protestant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and all hatred of vice, and dislike of Popish Superstition,
brought into contempt. For as they admit all true of Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans
which Papists object against Protestants, so they account
all Protestants almost (besides their own faction) Puritans. By
such is the Religion of the <hi>Scots</hi> made ridiculous; by such is the
amitie of the two Nations, and therein the Honour and safety
of the King, his Crown, and Progeny endangered. By such is
<hi>Calvin,</hi> &amp; the Reformers of our Religion for hearkning therein
to <hi>Calvin,</hi> traduced, and another reformation attempted; by
such is Antiquity preferred to obscure Scripture, Uniformity in
Ceremonies to the disadvantage of unity in hearts; by such is
the outside and walls of Religion trimmed and decored,
whilst the soule thereof is neglected and defaced; by such is
the Kings heart stolne from his Subjects, and the Subjects e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stranged
from the King: by such is the Name of Royalty pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
whilst a Papall Hierarchy onely is intended; by such
is dissention nourished in the State, that they may fish in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
waters: by such is truth in other men styled faction, and
faction in themselves styled truth; by such are innovations
preached and printed for necessary points, whilst necessary do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61021:6"/>
in other men are prohibited. In the power of such it
now remaines to teach and publish all things consonant to
their owne ends, and to quash and silence all gainsayers, and
either to promote or detrude all Suiters for preferment at
their discretion being absolutely possessed of Presses, Pulpits,
and the eares of great men; by such are many good men revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
and oppressed for their constancie to the true Religion,
whilst many factious, semipopish Dunces are unduly prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
every where for neutrality in Religion, or some worse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation;
by such are Puritans made as Sinks and Sewers to
unlode and discharge their own filth into, whilst their black
railing tongues expume nothing against Puritans, but what is
true of themselves. These things (if I am not deceived) will
appeare in this ensuing discourse.</p>
            <p>In all ages true Religion hath been odious amongst Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
and true devotion amongst Sensualists, Judaisme appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to Painims meer Superstition: Christianity seemed to the
Jewes grosse blasphemie: and now amongst Christians Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantisme
is nothing else but Heresie: and amongst Protestants
Zeal is misnamed Puritanisme; But in this word Puritanisme is
a greater mystery of defamation then ever was before, it may
well be called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, it is a word of depravation, fit
onely for these times, wherein the shine of the Gospel is at the
brightest, and the malice of Satan at the highest. This word
sprung up almost with the Reformation, no sooner had the

her issue, and she being fled into the Wildernesse, this streame
of infamy was spued forth after her to overtake her.</p>

1638. endeavours to make it credited, that Puritans have
increased since the Reformation by degrees, both in number
and malice: but the contrary is most apparently true.</p>
            <p>Dissent in Ecclesiasticall Policie about Ceremonies and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
smaller matters, being not of the substance of Religion,
first gave occasion to raise this reprochfull word Puritan in the
Church: but since that time mens minds being better satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61021:6"/>
and peace being more firmly setled about those indifferent
things, the more few Puritans remayned, and the more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately
those few became inclined, the more furiously their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
raged against them, <hi>Bastwick, Prin,</hi> and <hi>Burton,</hi> the
onely men which Law can take hold of, are Names now as
horrid in the world, as <hi>Garnet, Faux, Ravilliack. Precisians</hi>
have now wonne the Scene from <hi>Iesuites:</hi> Poysoning of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours,
massacring of Provinces, blowing up of Parliaments
are all now grown into oblivion, and drown'd in the stories of
Ceremony-haters. Howsoever as amongst Antipuritans, so
amongst Puritans (it must be confessed) there, are some diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
to be observed. Some Puritans think all Puritans alike
to be loved, and all Antipuritans alike to be hated, but sure
there is truer affinity in minde between some which are Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,
and some which are not, then between some Puritans and
others, or some of the contrary opinion and others. <hi>Paul</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted
equally opposes <hi>Peter</hi> as <hi>Simon Magus</hi> does, and
in regard of this joynt opposition, both are unanimous, but even
in this opposition both have their opposite ends. <hi>Magus</hi> oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
maliciously for ambition and lucres sake, but <hi>Paul</hi> igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly
seeking thereby the same Gods Honour whom <hi>Peter</hi>
serves in a truer way. Therefore in regard of the mayne end,
there is more unity and consent betwixt <hi>Paul</hi> the persecuter,
and <hi>Peter</hi> the persecuted, then betwixt <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Magus,</hi>
though both persecuters of the same cause. The like is now
visible in <hi>England,</hi> for every man which is an Antipuritan is
not so for the same Reasons, some have more of malice, others
are more ignorant, some are pestilent Engineers, and through
the sides of Puritans knowingly stab at purity it self, others are
but Engines misimployed, or by their owne blind zeal misled,
and these perhaps whilst they persecute Gods children, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
they doe God a gratefull service therein.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Samaria,</hi> from an unkindly mixture of <hi>Israelites</hi> and
<hi>Syrians,</hi> a strange <hi>heterogeneous</hi> of-spring different in Religion
from both did arise; and the like is now in <hi>England,</hi> nay, it
may be said here (as it was in <hi>Constantines</hi> dayes) There are
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61021:7"/>
almost as many Religions as Opinions, and as many Opinions
as Men. Papists have their differences, Protestants theirs,
therefore needs must there be many more differences where
Papists and Protestants live so confusedly blended together.
For examples sake, how many differences have we even about
indifferent Ceremonies; and that meerly amongst Protestants?
Some men loath Ceremonies out of Antipathy to Popery,
which too superstitiously extols them; others againe admire
them for Antiquities sake, which before Popery innocently
(yea, and perhaps profitably for those infant times of the
Gospel) used them. These two sorts of men, though different
are not dangerous. Again, some men are thought to disrelish
Ceremonies out of stomack to that authority which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
them; but if there be any such, I thinke they are very
few, and scarce visible to the eye of man. Others on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
give reverence to them for Poperies sake, which depends
so much upon them; and I feare there are many such amongst
us. Again, some men stand devoted to Ceremonies, as they
are the lightest things of the Law: like the Tythers of Mint
and Annis in the Gospel, embracing them instead of weightier
matters, and none are more unmercifull then these to scrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
minded men. Others in the mean while account all
things of the same moment, both great and small, pretending
to spie some faults, and some truths on either side, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they hold it indifferent to assent to either, or dissent from
either in any point whatever. But the wisest sort conceive there
may be errours on both sides, but not alike grosse and perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
and therefore such eschew the wrong, and apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to the right in either side, yet neither honour, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
either side alike. And these instances shew that all men
doe not professe, or condemne Puritanisme alike, or from the
same ends, and yet in the Chaos of this Countrey, as things
now stand.

I could wish therefore that all well meaning men would
take notice of these things, and affect by reason, not passion;
for since some good men are Puritans, and not all, and since
some ill men are Puritans, and not all, this ought not to be
a rule of love and hatred in all cases alike. That which is most
objected to Puritans, is fury, faction, and hypocrisie: if I see
these in a man reputed no Puritan, yet to me He is a Puritan:
and if I see not these in a man reputed a Puritan, as to me He is
no Puritan.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Gracchus</hi> be invective against Sedition, I censure him
by his actions, not by his words, and if <hi>Cato</hi> be accused of
mutiny, I censure him by himselfe, not by his accusers, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
none meerely because condemned by others; for it is
usuall for the Wolfe to sit on the Bench and condemne the
Lambe at Bar, for that which is most proper to the Wolfe
most unnaturall to the Lambe, and yet this proves the Wolfe
the more a Wolfe, and the Lambe the more a Lambe. I
cannot but professe it, there is nothing more scandalizes me
at this time, then to see Puritans being so few in number, so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicable
in condition, so harmelesse in example, so blamelesse
in opinion, yet sentenced and condemned in judgement, as if
they were the greatest Incendaries, and the only Innovators
in the Christian World. Doctor <hi>Heylin</hi> a violent pamphleter
against Puritans, calls <hi>Burton</hi> the great <hi>Dictator of Puritans,</hi>
and the Law hath past upon him with great severity, yet <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi>
crime was that He wrote against <hi>Altar-worship,</hi> and it
was adjudged that his style was seditious. It is not manifest
that his intention was seditious therein, and if it was so, it is
manifest that He was most vaine and absurd therein as our
State is now establisht, and as our King is generally revered,
They which pretend great danger to the King likely to ensue
out of such paper machinations as these, may have three mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous
ends therein. First, that they may be thought the only
solicitous men of the Kings safetie. Secondly, that they may
disparage the common peoples loyaltie. Thirdly, that they
may crush their adverse Puritanicall party; but, it is thought,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61021:8"/>
they which pretend most danger hereby to the King: doe
least believe themselves, and therefore they doe spin that affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and division out of the sufferings of <hi>Burton,</hi> &amp;c. which
his attempts could never have effected.</p>
            <p>My Lord of Canterbury in all his invectives against Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanisme,
ever made fury and turbulence the ground of all his
hatred and enmity against it, and yet let the whole world judge
if the earth ever brought forth any thing more furious and
turbulent then himself. At the same time whilst he adjudges
torture to that incendiary <hi>Burton,</hi> &amp;c. for writing a Pamphlet
against Altars, &amp;c. He himself is busie in sowing the Dragons
teeth (I may say the great red Dragons teeth) all over <hi>England
Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and putting all the three Kingdomes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a posture of warre, that like earthen vessels they may be
dashed to peeces by conflicting one against the other. To
whom can it be credible that <hi>Burtons</hi> quill should blow the
flame of warre amongst Nations so combined in spirituall,
carnall and politicall consanguinity; under the protection of
so peacefull a Prince, in such Halcyonean dayes of tranquilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
when even my Lord of Canterbury himself with all his
ill accomplices at home, and Spanish, Italian, French confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
abroad, ought for ever to be admired for his prevalence
in that vast stupendious dis-service? Howsoever, as the times
lately were, we beheld sedition grievously upbraided, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
in <hi>Burton</hi> by my Lord of Canterbury, and that old
verse applyed as a proverbe:
<q>
                  <l>Quis tulerit Gracchos de seditione loquentes?</l>
               </q>
But its no wonder that <hi>Burton</hi> should be an incendiary in that
mouth, wherein <hi>Calvin</hi> was a knave, Good God, could he
think the Reformed Religion any thing else but knavery,
when he calls Gods most sanctified and best inspired instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Reformation Knave? Because God doth not now
work by miracles, as he did in the first plantation of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel;
are not therefore his works as sacred, and his instruments
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61021:8"/>
as venerable? And since the Redemption, what work hath
God ever performed more noble, and for ever to be exalted
then the Reformation? for what was that worke, but a revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of lost salvation, and a new restauration of the buried
Gospel amongst us? and in that glorious worke who was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oynted
by God for a more egregious charge then <hi>Calvin?</hi> Is
it not therefore the same sin in kinde if not in degree so to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spurcate
and defile this blessed messenger of this blessed ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
with impure termes of obloquie, as it was to ascribe the
worke of our Saviour to <hi>Beelzebub?</hi> O the execrable gall of
that breast, and venome of that tongue, which through the
sides of <hi>Calvin</hi> did strive to defame the most gracious services
of <hi>Calvin,</hi> nay that most pure aud fiery Spirit of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
which enabled <hi>Calvin</hi> for those services! Needs must
he hate and prosecute all Puritans whatsoever, and reject
and disrelish all things whatsoever in Puritans, which is so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciously
bent against <hi>Calvin</hi> himselfe meerly because Puritans
have him in so high esteeme, for that holy Spirits sake which
rested so aboundantly upon him.</p>
            <p>But let us a little further search into the mysterious abuse,
and misapplication of this word Puritan. Those whom we
ordinarily call Puritans are men of strict life, and precise opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which cannot be hated for any thing but their singularity
in zeale and pietie, and certainly the number of such men is
too small, and their condition too low, and dejected: but
they which are the Devils chief Artificers in abusing this word
when they please, can so stretch and extend the same, that
scarce any civill honest Protestant which is hearty and true to
his Religion can avoid the aspersion of it, and when they list a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
they can so shrink it into a narrow sense, that it sha<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l
seem to be aimed at none but monstrous abominable Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes
and miscreants. Thus by its latitude it strikes generally,
by its contraction it pierces deeply, by its confused application
it deceives invisibly. Small scruples intitle mee to the name of
Puritan, and then the name of Puritan intitles me further to
all mischiefe whatsoever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:61021:9"/>
The <hi>Scots</hi> rise up against <hi>Episcopacie,</hi> it is questioned by
some, whether they so rise up, for the good of Religion, or for
the overthrow of wholsome Discipline.</p>
            <p>Answer is soone made, that Episcopacie cannot be unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to any but Puritans, there is no opinion can smell stronger
of Puritanisme, then that of a Church parity, and of Puritans
what good can be expected? but the Scots also desire redresse
in other grievances, and here their intention is againe question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Answer is as soone made again. That the Scots being decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
open Puritans, they must needs be enemies to Monarchicall
government, and that no redresse can ever satisfie them, but such
as shall debase royall dignity, and establish a popular rule a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them. But some of the Scots in some actions doe very
much misdemeane themselves, and here it's thought by some,
that this ought not to redound to the prejudice, or blame of the
whole Nation: but strait the Antipuritan steps in againe with
answer to the former purpose, that the same faction which
makes them all Puritans, makes them all mutiners, and that
there is no trust to be given, nor favour shewed to any whose
very religion is disobedience. Other the like examples may be
instanced in. Parliaments of late in <hi>England</hi> have beene jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
of religion, this laudable Zeale made them at first come
into contempt as Puritanicall, and then the imputation of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritanisme
made this laudable Zeale contemptible; and so by
degrees, as any thing else might be charged upon Puritans, as
disobedience, and disaffection to Monarchy, so nothing could be
charged but proceeding from Puritanisme. Some scrupulous
opinions make <hi>Say, Brooke, &amp;c.</hi> Puritans, Puritanisme inferres
them mutiners, mutinie makes all that they can doe or say,
all that they forbear to doe, or say, it makes their very thoughts
wicked and perverse. Thus wee see what a confused imposture
there is in this infamous terme of Puritan: but wee will yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
evidence by plaine instance how broad the devils net is in
the vast application of this word, and how deep his pit is by its
abominable sence, and the nature of its importance, that we
may the better discover that net which intangles so many, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61021:9"/>
shun that pit which ingulphs so sure. Puritans (as I said before)
were at first Ecclesiasticall only, so called because they did not
like a pompous or ceremonious kinde of discipline in the
Church like unto the Romish: but now it is come about, that
by a new enlargement of the name, the world is full of nothing
else but Puritans, for besides the Puritan in Church policie,
there are now added Puritans in Religion, Puritans in State,
and Puritans in morality. By this means whole Kingdomes
are familiarly upbraided with this sinne of Puritanisme: As
for example, All in <hi>Scotland</hi> which wish well to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
though some Papists, some Courtiers, and almost all the
whole body without exception have now declared themselves
for it, yet all these are manifest Puritans. So also in <hi>England,</hi> all
the Commons in Parliament, and almost all the ancient impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
temporall Nobility, and all such as favour and rellish the
late proceedings of both the houses, which is the maine body
of the Realme, Papists, Prelates and Courtiers excepted, nay,
and its likely all <hi>Scotland,</hi> and more then halfe <hi>Ireland,</hi> all these
are Puritans. They which deprave this great Councell of the
Kingdome, suggest to the King that the major part is gull'd
and dorde by the Puritan Party; but this is only because they
are ashamed to speake it out openly in grosse termes, that all
the major and better part in the Court of Parliament is Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanicall.
But this suggestion is utterly false and impossible, for
such as the major part in Parliament is, such are those that
chose them and sent them thither, and such are those that now
approve their actions there, and both in the elections of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
men, and in the consultations of Parliament affaires,
the Kings party is as wise, cautious and vigilant (if not more)
as the other party, and no subtilty could circumvent or cheat
them out of their votes, if the Puritans were so small and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable
a side, as now they make them. No man of what
capacity soever can admit this; it is to all undeniable, that the
blame of a Parliament, is the blame of a whole Kingdome.
But I returne to my Ecclesiasticall Puritan. Though it be
true that Ecclesiasticall Puritans are fewer now, then hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61021:10"/>
they have been, yet it is as true that Ecclesiasticall purita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme
is made a larger thing by farre then it was, being now
spread abroad like a net to ensnare the more, as our many late
additions and innovations testifie, which have crept into the
Church (as may be feared) for the vexation and molestation
of such men, as were not disquieted with former ceremonies.
It is generally suspected, that our Prelates have aimed at two
things in the novelties which they have lately induced into the
Church; first, the suppression of those which are enemies to
their pride, avarice, and ambition, by them tearmed Puritans:
secondly, their owne further ease, promotion, and advantage.
Both these ends seeme to be leveld at in sanctifying the Altar,
and unsanctifying the Lords day, in advancing auricular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
and corporall penances by externall mortifications, and
crying downe lecturing, and preaching; for if we marke it,
these new Doctrines doe not onely serve to terrifie and scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalize
tender consciences, and thereby to deprive, and silence
many painfull good Ministers, and to scare away into forreign
Plantations whole troups of Laymen, and to inwrap the rest in
opposition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but each of these doctrines besides hath a further
reach in it of benefit to the Clergie. The Communion Table
hath lately gained a new Name, a new Nature, a new Posture,
a new Worship that Emperours and Kings may be brought
againe to take notice how far the persons and offices of Priests
excell in sanctity the persons and offices of Princes. <hi>Theodosius</hi>
within one hundred yeares after Prelacie began to arrogate to
it selfe, was presently taught this lesson, for taking his seat in
the Chancell according to the Easterne and ancient fashion, a
Deacon was sent to him in great state, to let him understand
that none but men in holy Orders might presume to set their
feet on that sacred ground. This was then the Bishops Law,
not the Emperours, nor knowne in any other of his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
but <hi>Italy</hi> onely; but sure it was fit discretion, that much
should be ascribed by Bishops to that place, from which they
were to derive much, and which would be sure to repay their
homage with so great an advantage of homage back againe.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61021:10"/>
Preaching is now also grown too burthensome, and the Lords
Day to Priests according to that sanctity which Puritans al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
it, it requires too much praying, preaching, singing, which
are not onely to them tedious, but also apt means to encrease,
and foment Puritanisme amongst the people. Auricular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
also is a godly devise to bring the Laity into subjection,
and to make the people bow before the power of the Keyes,
and it may aptly force the consciences of Kings themselves to
feare the scourges of gowned men. Adde lastly Mr. <hi>Wats</hi> his
bodily mortification to Mr. <hi>Sparrows</hi> confession, and then
Laymen will be soone inured againe to finde out the fittest
penances, especially <hi>Praesbyteris, &amp; aeris advolvi,</hi> and so in
time their purses, their bodies, their consciences shall all bee
made sensible of the spirituall Scepter of Priests.</p>
            <p>Its no great wonder then if our Court Divines, and their
dependents doe what they can to draw us neerer dayly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Popery, under shew of Antiquity, Uniformity and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
for (without all doubt) of all Religions, Popery is the
most beneficiall to Priests, most tyrannous to Laymen. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is it strange that they pretend so much zeale and devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the Kings Crowne and Prerogative, as things now stand
in <hi>England,</hi> as if none truly affected the same but themselves,
for its cleare, that they cannot subject the people but by the
King, nor the King without the people: and so long as they
stand possessed of the Kings good opinion, no man shall have
power to confute them.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Iames</hi> is a great instance for Antipuritans, and a great
prop to the Episcopall Cause, its alleadged of him that Hee
hated Puritans for their hatred to Episcopacie, and loved E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopacie
for its amity to Monarchie: His Aphorisme was,
<hi>No Bishop, no King:</hi> Let us therefore appeale from King
<hi>Iames</hi> in their words to King <hi>Iames</hi> in his owne. In his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
before his <hi>Basilicon Doron</hi> his words are: <hi>The style of
Puritans properly belongs to that vile Sect of the Anabaptists,
onely called the Family of love, Such were</hi> Browne, Penry,
<hi>Howbeit there are others which participate too much with Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61021:11"/>
contemning civill Magistrates,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>It is onely this
sort of men which I wish my sonne to punish in case they refuse to
obey Law, and cease not to stirre up Rebellion. But I protest up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
mine Honour, I meane it not generally of all Preachers or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
which like better of the single forme of Policie in our
Church of</hi> Scotland, <hi>then of the many Ceremonies in the Church
of</hi> England, <hi>which are perswaded that Bishops smell of a Papall
supremacie, that Surplices, Caps, &amp;c. are outward badges of
popish errour. No, I am so farre from being contentious in
these indifferent things, that I doe equally love and honour the
learned and grave of either opinion, It can no wayes become mee
to pronounce sentence so lightly in so old a controversie. Since
wee all agree in grounds, the bitternesse of men in such questions
doth but trouble the peace of the Church, and give advantage to
Papists by our division.</hi> These were the golden words of that
peacefull, just Prince upon his second thoughts: ô that they
were now duly pondred, and taken to peeces word for word!
ô that they were esteemed, and understood in their owne
weight amongst us, that they might reconcile our present dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences,
and that the same peace which followed him to his
glorious Urne, might still blesse these our times! ò how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
are these mild words to the unnaturall suggestions of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipuritans!
Such as daily accuse all good men for Precisians,
and all precise men for Puritans, and all Puritans for the onely
Firebrands of the World, thus aiming the King against his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and by consequence raising Subjects against the King;
Puritans here are described both what they are, and what they
are not, the King had been misinterpreted before, writing ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
of Puritans, now to avoid all mistake, he expresses him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
plainely and definitely. A Puritan positively in King
<hi>Iames</hi> his sense, is He which imitates Anabaptists in rebellion,
turbulence and opposition to Law, and such are liable to Law;
but negatively a Puritan in the acception of King <hi>Iames,</hi> is not
He which dislikes Episcopacie, or the Ceremonious Discipline
of <hi>England.</hi> This King <hi>Iames</hi> protests upon his honour, though
to his great dishonour He be now often cited to the contrary.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61021:11"/>
As for those which rellish not Bishops and Ceremonies or the
<hi>English</hi> Policie, Wishes them to be at peace only with those
of the opposite opinion, Hee himselfe vowing equall love and
honour to the grave, and learned of either side, and not taking
upon him to be a Judge in so old and difficult a controversie;
He onely like a sweet arbitrator perswades both parties to
peace and amity. I wish our Bishops would now stand to
this arbitration, I wish they would neither condemne the <hi>Scots</hi>
discipline, nor urge the <hi>English;</hi> I wish they would put diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betweene seditious and scrupulous Puritans, and not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
the one out of the other; I wish they would either dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime
King <hi>Iames</hi> as a manifest favourer of Puritans, or else
imitate him in the same definition, and opinion of them. King
<hi>Iames</hi> further takes notice, that the reformation in <hi>Scotland</hi>
was far more disorderly, then in <hi>England, Denmark</hi> &amp;c. whilst
the mayne affaires there were unduly carried by popular tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults,
and by some fiery-spirited Ministers, which having got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
the guiding of the multitude, and finding the relish of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
sweet, did fancie to themselves a democratick forme
of policy, wherein they were likely to be <hi>Tribuni plebis.</hi> That
the Crown might be disincombred of these usurping ring-leaders,
the King advises the Prince to entertaine and advance
godly, learned, and modest Ministers, promoting them to
Bishopricks, but restrayning them heedfully from pride, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
and avarice. These things then are hence observable.
First, <hi>Scotland</hi> differs from <hi>England</hi> in turbulent Ministers:
Secondly, this is imputed to the iniquity of the times, not to
Puritanisme, as if by nature the Scots were more inclining to
Puritanisme then other Nations. Thirdly, notwithstanding
that iniquity of those times, there was a number sufficient of
worthy Ministers fit for preferrement. Fourthly, King <hi>Iames</hi>
erects Bishops Sees in <hi>Scotland</hi> for peculiar reasons, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
He speaks not of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> &amp;c. Lastly, notwithstanding
that peculiar reason, He advises the Prince to be indifferently
at warre with both extreams alike, as well to represse Papall
Bishops, as to curbe proud Puritans. For (sayes the King) <hi>the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61021:12"/>
naturall sicknesses which have ever troubled and beene the decay
of all Churches since the beginning changing the Candlesticke
from one to another, have beene pride, ambition, and avarice:
and these wrought the overthrow of the Romish Church in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Countreys.</hi> King <hi>Iames</hi> knew well how apt Churchmen
had ever beene to abuse their power and pompe, what ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
the High-Priests had beene to our Saviour, and what a
tyranny Bishops had erected over all Christendome ever since
<hi>Constantine</hi> almost, and therefore though he dislikes a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracie
in the Church, (as Hee had reason) yet Hee so li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
and circumscribes his Bishops both in power and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
that they might be as sensible of their chaines and fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
as of their Miters and Crosiers. I wish King <hi>Iames</hi> had
particularly signified what bonds and bounds Hee thought
fit to prefixe to Episcopacie, to preserve it from corruption,
and what his opinion was of a Prelacie so active in
secular affaires as ours is now in <hi>England,</hi> and how it
would have pleased him to see a Metropolitan amongst Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
almost a rivall to the French Cardinall. The
world, in my opinion, hath little reason to doate upon a
gowned Empire, wee have all smarted long enough under it,
men of meane birth commonly beare preferment with little
moderation, and their breeding having beene soft and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate,
in their malice and cruelty they neerest of all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
to the nature of Women: and by the advantage of
learning they extend their power, and win upon others more
then they ought.</p>
            <p>When the Church was at first under Heathen, or Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
Governours, which sought as enemies to ruine it, not
as Fathers to protect it, they which were within could not
live in peace and unity without some Politicall bonds, so at
that time there was a necessity of some coercive power
within, besides that which was without. The world is now
unsatisfied what kinde of power that was, whether Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
or Presbyteriall, or what Episcopacy, or Presbytery was
in those dayes. Yet me thinks what government so ever
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61021:12"/>
then was, it is not necessarily precedentary to us now.
The Episcopall faction at this day takes advantage by the
abuses of the Presbyteriall, and the Presbyteriall by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopall,
and most men thinke either the one power or the
other necessary, and some more favour the Episcopall as
K. <hi>Iames,</hi> some the Presbyteriall as M. <hi>Calvin;</hi> but sure the
Presbyteriall is lesse offensive then the Episcopall, and yet
neither the one nor other of necessity. Kings may grant
<hi>usuram quandam jurisdictionis</hi> either to Bishops or El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
but the jurisdiction it selfe is their owne property,
from which they ought not to depart, nor can without
wrong to their charge committed to them. For the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
which God gives the Prince, is not given for his use
alone, but for the peoples benefit, so that since He cannot
let it fall to decay without making it insufficient for
good and entire government which is mischievous to the
people, he cannot justly lessen it at all. And it is manifest
that except one supreme head be alone in all causes as well
Ecclesiasticall as Civill, humane nature must needs be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
of those remedies which are necessary for its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,
since power cannot be divided, but it must be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minished
to him which suffers that division, and being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minished
it proves insufficient. All confesse some go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
necessary for men in holy Orders, to whom the
power of the Keyes belongs, but some account Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
but as meere Temporall or Lay persons, and therefore
conclude against their authority over sacred Ecclesiasticall
persons as incompetent, especially in cases meerely Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall.
For this cause spirituall Governours have ever
beene in the Church to whom some have attributed a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
right depending from none but God, and subordinate
to none but God, but this hath beene controverted by
others, and no little debate and strife hath followed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.
But it seemes to me, that Princes do receive from
God a spirituall Unction, whereby not onely their persons
are dignified, and their hearts prepared and enlarged with
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61021:13"/>
divine graces fit for rule; but their functions also innobled
and sanctified above any other whatsoever, and higher
advanced then the sense of Laick or Secular will beare.
To Princes an assistance of counsell is requisite in spirituall
as in civill affaires, but that, that Counsaile ought to bee
composed onely of persons Ecclesiasticall, or that those
persons ought to bee invested with all those Ensignes of
Honour and Authority which our Bishops now claime
as of divine right, seemes not necessary. Clergy-men are
not alwayes the most knowing in all Ecclesiasticall cases,
neither are they at all indifferent and impartiall, in many
which concerne their owne honour and profit, (as the
world feeles to his regret) therefore for jurisdiction they
are not the most competent. But be they of what use so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
they may still remaine subordinate, and at the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
election, and admitted of <hi>ad consilium solum,</hi> not <hi>ad
consensum,</hi> and it had beene happy for all Christians these
many hundred yeares by past if they had not been further
hearkned to. The Sacerdotall function is not at all dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
by this subordination, for whether the order of
Princes be more sacred then that of Bishops, or not, it is
all one to Priests, for an obedience they owe, and must
pay, be it to the one Order or the other. Our Bishops at
this day stand much upon their Divine right of Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and they refer their style to the providence of God
immediatly, not to the grace of the King: and though in
words they acknowledge a Supremacie of power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
to the King; yet indeed I thinke they mean rather a
priority of order. Whatsoever Supremacie they meane,
if it be not such as makes them meerely subordinate, and
dependent, so that the King may limit, alter, or extinguish
their jurisdiction, as far as He may to his civill Judges, they
derogate much from his Kingly office.</p>
            <p>Bishops for their claime of Jurisdiction ought to prove
that they alone did exercise it over all in all causes from
our Saviours dayes, till the entrance of Christian Princes:
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61021:13"/>
and that being cleared, they must further prove, that those
times also are leading, and precedentary to ours. In both
these their proofes are lame, especially in the latter; for
neither is the power of the Keyes the same thing as Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
nor is jurisdiction now as it was in the Apostles
dayes, nor is the State of the times now the same as
then.</p>
            <p>In those dayes either Christians were to implead one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
before Infidel Magistrats whatsoever the case were,
criminall or civill, spirituall or temporall, or else they
were to erect some tribunall in the Church, or else they
were to await no justice at all: and because some judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
within the Church was most fit, therfore Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
according to the exigence of those times, did endow
his Church with a divine Oeconomy, which was partly
miraculous, and of use then but not now. The Spirit of God
did then internally incite such and such men at such times
to reside and preside in such &amp; such places; and some of the
Apostles at some times could judge by inspiration without
proofs and allegations, and could execute sentence of death
or other spirituall punishment upon secret hypocrites, not
intrenching upon temporall authority, but in these times
this discipline is uselesse, and therefore decayed. Whatsoever
the offence then was, what injury or trespasse soever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
brother and brother, the onely remedy was <hi>Dic Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiae,</hi>
and yet that precept serves as strong for temporall
as spirituall trespasses, so that it cannot be enforced now
to continue, unlesse wee meane to drowne all temporall
authority. As for the extent also of spirituall power in
those dayes, I will onely cite a learned Politician of the
Popish religion: who admitting (it seemed) that the keyes
of heaven were given to Saint <hi>Peter</hi> alone, and his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours,
and not to all Bishops and Ministers whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
thus proceeds. By the keyes given to S. <hi>Peter</hi> many
Holy Fathers mean, the one of knowledge, and the other of
power, and that that power ought not to be understood
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61021:14"/>
universally, but only concerning the Kingdome of Heaven
which is spirituall: for the Civill, Royall, and Temporall
power is expresly forbidden him by Christ. Even so that
also of knowledge, it is not to be understood of naturall, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litike,
or morall things, but as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, of Christs
mysteries only.</p>
            <p>Wherefore in matters of faith Ecclesiasticall authority
may approve, and Secular cannot condemne, but in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of policy what all the Prelates in the World approve,
Temporall authority may condemne. It is a great wrong
to pretend, because Christ hath given Saint <hi>Peter</hi> the cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance
and power of the Kingdome, and forbidden him
the earthly, contrary to this precept, to extend spirituall
things to temporall. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> often saith, <hi>That
Grace doth not destroy any thing in Nature, but leaveth her
all her owne; adding moreover divine perfection.</hi> The
Temporality hath of its owne nature, power to forbid all
things repugnant to publike quietnesse and honesty; and
Christ came not to take away this authority from Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,
He onely addes power to his Ministers in matters
of faith, not knowne by nature, but revelation. For ought
wee know, this power of opening or shutting Heaven,
of binding and loosing sinnes was miraculous, and so but
Temporary: but admit it in this Catholike Writers sense,
yet we plainly see, it is no prejudice at all to limit Secular
Princes thereby. The same learned Papist writes: That
the Easterne and Westerne Churches continued in unity
and charity for the space of nine hundred yeares after
Christ, and this peace was easily kept, because the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
power was then in the Canons, to which all
Churches acknowledged themselves equally subject. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall
Discipline was then severely maintained in
each Country by its owne Prelates, not arbitrarily, but
absolutely according to Canonicall rigour, none of them
intermedling in anothers government. No Pope of <hi>Rome</hi>
did pretend to conferre Benefices in other Bishops Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61021:14"/>
or to get money out of others by way of Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations
and Buls: but when <hi>Rome</hi> began to shake off all
subjection to Canons, then notwithstanding any ancient
order of the Fathers, Councels, or Apostles themselves,
in stead of her ancient Primacy she brought in an absolute
Dominion, free from any Law or Canon, and this made the
division. Neither could any re-union bee brought to
passe within these 700 yeares, because this abuse which
caused the Division is not remedied. Whilst the union
held, Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> doctrine was joyntly observed, that
<hi>Every one should be subject to Princes, no man pretended to
be free from punishment.</hi> Nay, and after the division, the
same opinion remained, that every Christian in temporall
businesses is subject to the Prince. And nothing is more
temporall then offence, because nothing is more contrary
to the Spirit. Amongst the <hi>Greeks</hi> also it is still held that
Bishops ought to judge what opinion is sound, what He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall,
but to punish those of hurtfull opinions belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to the Secular.</p>
            <p>The State of <hi>Venice,</hi> as well as other Catholike King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
walks between two extreams, betweene Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,
which have no other ayme but to diminish Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall
authority, and the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> which hath no
other aime, but to encrease it, and to make the Temporall
her servant.</p>
            <p>Those of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> making use of Religion
for worldly ends and respects under a spirituall pretense,
but with an ambitious end and desire of worldly wealth
and honour would free themselves from obedience due
to the Prince, and take away the love and reverence due
by the people to draw it to themselves. To bring these
things to passe, they have newly invented a doctrine that
talks of nothing but Ecclesiasticall greatnesse, liberty, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity,
and jurisdiction.</p>
            <p>This doctrine was unheard of, till about the year 1300,
then it began to be written scatteringly in some books, but
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61021:15"/>
till 1400, there were not written above two Bookes
which treated of nothing else; after this such Writers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
a little, but after 1560, there were scarce any
Bookes printed in <hi>Italy,</hi> but in diminution of Secular au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and exaltation of the Ecclesiasticall: And now
the people have scarce any other Bookes to read, nor have
the Confessors any other doctrine, or need any other learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Hence comes this perverse opinion, that Magistracy
is a humane invention, and to be obeyed for policy onely,
not for conscience: but that every intimation of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall
persons is equivolent to a divine precept; there
want not in <hi>Italy,</hi> pious, learned men which hold the
contrary, but they are not suffered to write, or print. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are forraine Books permitted, or ancient Authours
left ungelded of all which serves for Temporall authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
as appears by a book printed 1607, called <hi>Index Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purgatorius:</hi>
and <hi>Clement</hi> the Eighth in 1595, published
a rule in his <hi>Index,</hi> that all Catholike Writers Bookes since
1515, might be corrected not only by expunging but also
by interlining, and this hath beene practised though not
publikely above seventy yeares. Thus we finde the Court
of <hi>Romes,</hi> but not the Authors meaning, and finally, wee
are sure to have no book true. I have hitherto cited this
egregious Politician, for these purposes.</p>
            <p>First, That we may see how easie it is for Clergie-men
to wrest all authority out of the Temporalties hands, if
Princes will be so easie to be hood-winkt, and deluded by
them, and to resigne their judgements to them in such cases
as concern their profit and advancement.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That we may take notice how far the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edst
of Papists themselves doe discover, and detect the
errours and tyranny of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
way of deceiving, whereby all hope of remedy is cut
off. I observe this also the rather because our Prelates in
<hi>England</hi> at this day assume to themselves almost as vast and
unquestionable a power of stifling and repressing all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61021:15"/>
disputes, and of authorizing and publishing all ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
whatsoever favouring their cause, as the Court
of <hi>Rome</hi> does.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that I might produce the same Author against
himselfe in those points wherein he taxes Protestants. Wee
will yeeld that for the space of nine hundred yeeres the
See of <hi>Rome</hi> did not usurpe over other Sees, but did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
equall subjection to the Canons, and that the
division and separation of the Easterne Churches happened
when <hi>Rome</hi> arrogated above Canons; but withall we must
have it yeelded to us, that those Canons had been compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
only by Clergy-men, and that in too much favour of
Clergy-men, and too much abridgement of Temporall
Rights and Priviledges, and that they did concerne mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
more then meerely spirituall, and speculative, and
things known by meere revelation. So that though one
Prelate did not usurpe over another, yet all Prelates had
usurped over the Laity from the times of <hi>Constantine</hi>
almost.</p>
            <p>It is true, the Church had Bishops before in its times
of persecution, but of what power or pompe? It is said
of <hi>Calvin,</hi> that in regard of his sway in <hi>Geneva,</hi> he wanted
nothing but the Name of Bishop; and it may be as truly
said of the Bishops before <hi>Constantine,</hi> that they wanted
all but the Name.</p>
            <p>The power of Bishops before the installment of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Princes, was rather like that of Arbitrators then of
Judges, and that held in all cases alike, Civill and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall,
but in case of disobedience they did not intrench so
farre upon the Lay power, as to inflict any pecuniary, or
corporall punishment, but they did deny the Sacrament,
and eject delinquents out of the Congregation, and this
was then an abscission from Christ, being done <hi>Clave non
errante:</hi> that is, whilst God did inspire (according to his
promise) a miraculous power of binding and loosing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:61021:16"/>
The Priestly function was then an Office, not a juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
of sacred dignity, not power: but the Function of
a Prince was ever sacred both for honour and power, for
dignity and command. <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great was the first
Prince which tooke upon him the care and protection of
the Church, after that it had suffered contempt and pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
for 300 yeares: and now did even that authority and
protection cease, and devolve into his hands, which the
poore persecuted Bishops had but feebly managed before;
but such was the extraordinary indulgence of this pious
Emperour, as well to religious persons, as to Religion it
selfe, that taking little notice what the Church had gain'd
by him as its Head and Governour, He heaped up greater
Titles and Honors upon Bishops, Archbishops, Patriarchs,
and Popes, as if some other supreme Ruler more sacred
and competent then himselfe were necessary. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
it is thought, that this was as poyson poured into the
Church, and not Balme, for from that very time Clergy-men
began to be more glorious, but lesse gracious, more
rich outwardly, but more poore, and vile inwardly.
Within a little space after <hi>Constantine</hi> there was just cause
of complaint that excessive Honours had corrupted the
Church, and that Religion had prospered better in former
times, when it had wooden Chalices and golden Priests,
then now, when it had golden Chalices, but wooden
Priests. It is remarkable also, that soon after <hi>Constantine</hi>
the temporall power being too much restrained, and aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and the spirituall as much inlarged and exalted, the
whole face of Christendome began to be imbroyled with
wars, and poysoned with heresies, so that the Historians of
those times have almost nothing else to write of but the
forcible investing and devesting by armes of such Bishops
and Patriarchs, and of the oppositions of such and such
Councels and Synods, and of the Appeals, Iars, Schismes,
Excommunications, and Commotions of such, and such
Priests, and Monks. Nay, such were the ill effects of those
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61021:16"/>
ages, which were certainly more zealous then politike,
that they cannot yet be wholly rectified, and purged in
these our latter times, which are growne too too con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
being more politike then zealous: Thus did the
Church fare for 900. yeares till the <hi>Romane</hi> Bishops
began to Empire above all, and then did the greatest
part of the Clergie themselves, especially East from
<hi>Italy,</hi> make their departure and separation. Neither did
the Romish Vice-god after this great rent and division
in the world hang his head for shame, or seeke any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union
by letting fall his pompous, painted plumes, but
audaciates himselfe rather to mount higher yet, and to
detrude the Western Emperour quite out of the bounds
of <hi>Italy.</hi> And in this, his industry failes him not, for after
much bloud-shed in many cruell conflicts Hee gaines in
<hi>Italy</hi> a Temporall, and in all <hi>Europe</hi> besides a spirituall
Monarchy, making a triple Mitre shine as gloriously
upon the seven-hilled City, as the Diadem had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
During his warres with the Emperour of <hi>Germany,</hi>
He had other contestations also with <hi>England,</hi> and some
other Potentates at sometimes, but all dismaid him not,
only once He was heard to say, <hi>It was time for him to
compound with the Dragon, that he might crush the lesser
Adders at his pleasure.</hi> Yet after this even this Holy
tyranny growes too insolent and insufferable, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spires
its owne dissolution, so that many Countries in
the North-west parts lying more remote from <hi>Rome,</hi>
quite revolt from her Allegeance, and protest against
her. Amongst those other Countries also lesse distant,
which still in words confesse her Supremacy, her Reigne
is now but little more then precarious: <hi>Venice</hi> regards
not Buls and Anathemaes, <hi>France</hi> disdaines a yonger
brothers benediction, and <hi>Spaine</hi> being honoured with the
title of the Popes eldest Son, confesses him a Father but
imployes him as a Chaplain, gives verball, but reapes reall
honours by him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:61021:17"/>
               <hi>Augustus</hi> having cashiered an unworthy Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
gave him leave to say, that hee had cashiered <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus:</hi>
and so the Popes great sonnes shake off his
yoke by degrees, but conceale it, and give him leave to
doe the like.</p>
            <p>It is now very good policy in the Pope, not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to Temporall things as they stand <hi>in ordine,</hi> or
have relation to spirituall things, but rather to relinquish
his right to spirituall things, as they stand in order
to Temporall: it is eminent wisedome in him to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare
threatning, roaring, cursing, and sending his ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
Epigrams, out of his owne Territories: as he
was wont to doe: Nay, his very last refuge of sending
forth his poysoning and stabbing Ministers cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
in season much longer. But to returne to our
learned Statesman: as Hee justly taxes the Court of
<hi>Rome,</hi> so Hee unjustly taxes Protestants of the contrary
extreme, and this will appeare out of his owne words.
For He grants, first that the Secular Magistrates have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
diminished of their authority by Christs comming<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and it is cleare that Princes were absolute Governours
of the Church before Christ both in Spirituall and
Temporall Cases.</p>
            <p>In the next place He yeelds, that the power and
knowledge of Clergy-men, called the power of the
Keyes, is no other but such as Christ infuses in meere
supernaturall things, knowne onely by Faith and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
not by any physicall, or Ethicall Principles;
but it is easily proved by us, that such power can extend
to no proper jurisdiction at all in humane affaires, but is
a meere speculative Notion, and such we deny not.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Hee yeelds that in Jurisdiction there bee
three things distinct.</p>
            <p>First, matter of Law.</p>
            <p>Secondly, matter of fact.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:61021:17"/>
Thirdly, matter of execution: whereby retribution
is made to every fact according to Law. The first of
these, and that in Spirituall Cases alone being tryable
by Clergy-men only. Admit this and nothing followes,
but that things meerely Spirituall, are best knowne to
Spirituall persons, there is no power here concluded.
As for example. In case of Heresie, that I hold such
an opinion, must appeare by witnesses and proofes,
and herein all kindes of witnesses besides Clergy-men
are competent.</p>
            <p>Next, that this opinion is hereticall, requires the
judgement of Ecclesiasticall persons, but it does not
follow, if they be the fittest Judges herein, that they
must bee the supreme Judges herein, and not as well
Dependent and Subordinate as our Civill Judges are
in common actions. But in the last place, that such
an hereticall opinion, so dangerous and pestilent to the
Church and Common-wealth ought to bee corrected or
eradicated by such coercive force, and the raising of
that force whereby it is to be punished, is in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and in the power of the Supreme Magistrate,
for two Magistrates cannot have a Supreme power of
the same sword. Either the Secular must command
the Ecclesiasticall, or the Ecclesiasticall must command
the Secular, as to coercive power, or a worse confusion
then either must needs follow.</p>
            <p>So then, it is the Execution of justice alone, which
is essentiall to the Supreme Governour, Matter of
Law requires a Counsellour, Matter of fact a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
Matter of Execution alone intimates a Prince,
and that Principality cannot bee divided betwixt two
persons of a severall nature.</p>
            <p>From hence then it appeares plainely that no Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
differing from the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> ascribes more
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61021:18"/>
to Clergy-men, then this first poynt of adjudging
according to the Law of God in things Divine; and
this implyes rather a dependent, then an independent
condition in the judge: and in this Protestants joyne
with full consent. But all this while I finde my selfe
in a digression: my scope is not to proove that Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
doe attribute sufficient to Priests, it lies upon
mee to prove that they attribute too much to them, and
herein I am to undertake not onely the Episcopall, but
the Presbyteriall side also, not onely Protestant Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,
but even Master CALVIN that great Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prelate
also.</p>
            <p>Divines have much trumped the World hitherto in
not setting forth the true bounds and limits of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall
jurisdiction, but if I mistake not, the first
power (which they claime as most essentiall) they take
to be the power of the Keyes, though they define
not certainly, what that is, whether a power, or Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice;
or to whom belonging, or of what extent, and
continuance.</p>
            <p>The second power which they insist upon, as next
issuing out of the power of the Keyes, is in Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,
Ordination of Ministers, Exposition of
Scriptures, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The third and more remote kinde of causes wherein
they challenge an Ecclesiasticall power, is of such as
concerne Matrimonie, Testaments, Heresies, Fasts,
Tythes, and Immunities of Clergy-men, &amp;c. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doubtlesse they would proceed, but that these sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
so much of the Temporality, and discover their
trumpery; but I have said, if in all these cases Clergy-men
are necessarily more knowing and impartiall then
all men else, there is necessity of their Counsell to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
matter of Law, but not of their Consent in apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
coercive, and forcible remedies for the execution of
Law. I have said also that Clergie-men being as well Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61021:18"/>
of the Common-wealth, as sonnes of the Church,
and these Cases importing as well perturbance of the State,
annoyance to the Church, that there can be but one Head
which ought to have command over both, and in both. It
is manifest also that many Cases are partly temporall, and
partly spirituall, and that scarce any is so temporall, but
that it relates in some order to spirituall things, or any so
spirituall, but that it hath some relation to temporall
things, so that the true subject of Ecclesiasticall and civill
justice cannot rightly be divided. Further, also it is as
manifest that where any doubt, strife, or uncertainty may
arise betweene one Jurisdiction and another, neither ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
any supreme power of decision, no assured
peace can continue, and by consequence no stability or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent
subsistence to either, is to be expected. It is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
therefore to be inferred, that either the Temporall or
the Ecclesiasticall Magistrate must be in all Cases abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
predominant, and that since the Ecclesiasticall ought
not by Christs owne command, therefore the Temporall
ought, as hath been further proved by sundry arguments,
and Scripture proofes alledged out of this famous Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian.
So much of the temporall power, and its necessary
Supremacie: my endevour shall be now to maintain that
no Ecclesiasticall power is at all necessary in meere Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall
persons.</p>
            <p>Master <hi>Calvin</hi> according to the popish grounds main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
that spirituall jurisdiction differs from temporall, and
is not incompatible but assistant thereto, because it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
not the same ends, but severall, which by severall
meanes may be the better compassed. But the spirituall
Magistrate (as I conceive) can propose no other end, then
what the Secular ought to ayme at, for either the Prince
ought to have no care at all of the Honour of God, and
the good of men, and that which is the prime meane of
both, true Religion, or else his ends must bee the same
which the Prelate aymes at, <hi>viz.</hi> to vindicate Religion
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61021:19"/>
by removing and correcting scandalous offenders. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
to preserve the innocent from contagion by the
separation of open offenders. Thirdly, to prevent further
obduration, or to procure the amendment of such as have
transgressed by wholsome chastisement.</p>
            <p>This is beyond all controversie, as also that the person
and power of a Prince, are as sacred to effect these ends,
as the Prelates: and certainly, God did not so sanctifie
their persons and offices for any lesse end. And therefore
in ancient times Holy Bishops did preach and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
nothing more to Princes then the care of Religion,
though proud Prelates now arrogate this onely to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and though it be still apparant, that no offence is
so spirituall, but that it is a civill evill, as well as a ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
to Religion: forsomuch as true Religion is the
foundation of a State. And this could not bee, neither
were Princes answerable to God for the corruption of
Religion, if God had not given them a supreme power,
and that effectuall to bring all offenders whatsoever to
confession, satisfaction and contrition, or to expell them
the congregation by themselves, or their surrogates.</p>
            <p>Master <hi>Calvin</hi> instances in adultery and drunkennesse,
&amp;c. and sayes, <hi>That the temporall power punishes these by
externall force, and for publicke examples sake, as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes
the State, but the Spirituall Iudge punishes them
without force internally for the amendment of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent.</hi>
Hee might as well have named swearing, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
stealing, murdering, and all sinnes whatsoever,
and so have made all men twice punishable, and the
Ecclesiasticall Courts as full of businesse as the Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
to the great vexation of the State, and danger of
division, out of this false ground onely that Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
power hath not a competence for the amendment
of offenders, or for the care of Religion, but only for the
satisfaction of wronged parties, and the expedition of
Civill Justice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:61021:19"/>
This is a way to erect <hi>regnum in regno,</hi> and to maintaine such
concurrent jurisdictions, as cannot possibly stand together, for all
being subject to sin and offence, as well the Spirituall as temporal,
either the one or other must go unquestioned, and this may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
division, or else both; and that will cause most certaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion.
Both sides here seem strangely puzled, the rigidest of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopall
faction allow Princes a coercive power over Priests, and
Prelats, where they performe not what their duty is in their fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
or jurisdictions, and this power requires a higher power
of summoning, arraigning, and legally trying them: and yet the
moderatest of the Presbyteriall faction would have Princes que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable,
tryable and punishable by the Spiritualty. This is a grosse
confusion, which will appeare to be so more plainly in the sequel;
when it is more fully cleared, that to Princes alone God has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely
committed <hi>utramque tubam,</hi> and <hi>utramque tabulam</hi> too, as
our reverend <hi>Andrews</hi> says.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>'Tis true, as</hi> Calvin <hi>alleadges,</hi> Princes are sons of the Church,
they are in it, not above it: the word intending the Church universall,
such as is both militant and triumphant; past, present, and future;for
that hath no other head but Christ: to that all Princes and Priests are
equally sons: but take Church for such or such a Nationall, Locall
Church, and then the Prince is head thereof, under Christ; and the
Clergy are part of his charge, and under his protection.</p>
            <p>The same man also may in diverse respects be both father and
son to the same man without confusion of relations. A King, a
Bishop may heare the Word, and receive the Sacrament from an
inferiour Minister; a Subject may be naturall father to his Prince,
and in this respect, a filiall subjection is due from the Superiour,
and so a King may referre his own case to his Chancellor, yet this
destroyes not the greater, higher, and more generall superiority
in other things, at other times. And to me it seemes that even in
the exercise of the Keys, the Priest officiates under the Prince, as
the Chancellour does in matters of Law, even when the Kings
own case lyes in Iudgement before him, and when perhaps hee
makes a decree against his own Master, and contrary to his owne
Masters private advertisement: and yet the King is not properly
either Lawyer or Theologue, though both are actuated, and orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized
as it were, by the soule like commanding, over-seeing, and
over-ruling of his more sublime and divine power.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:61021:20"/>
Herein the Priest also may learne a limitation from the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer,
for though the Iudge bee bound to pronounce right Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
against his owne Master, yet this holds not in all cases a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like;
because of his limitted condition, for in Criminall cases
such as concerne the safety of the Kings own person, or the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
dignity of his calling, therein Iudgement must be utterly mute.
And therefore it is a weake argument of Master <hi>Calvin,</hi> though it
be his best: when he inferres a necessity of an Ecclesiasticall Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature
from hence, because else the Prince himselfe wanting
punishment, should escape free: for the reason is the same in
matters of Law; the King is not questionable, or responsible,
for personall crimes, and yet this is held no politicall mischiefe.
Besides if the Prince shall not go unquestioned, or undiscipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the Spirituall, yet the supreme Spirituall Magistrate must,
and this is an equall, if not a greater mischiefe: for both cannot
be equally lyable to the judgement of each other. Neither is it to
much purpose that the example of Bishop <hi>Ambrose</hi> so harshly, so
unreverendly treating pious penitent <hi>Theodosius,</hi> is so confidently
cited always by either faction Episcopall and Presbyteriall; for
though the name of <hi>Ambrose</hi> be great, yet I will crave leave to
speake as an Advocate against him in the name of the Emperour
<hi>Theodosius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reverend Sir, you take upon you to be a Iudge over me, and to
condemne me of a bloudy Massacre committed unjustly at <hi>Thessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonica,</hi>
and being so condemned, you proceed against mee
with your ghostly punishment, subjecting me to your Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall
severity: But I pray consider what mischiefes may follow
hereupon; if Emperours may be punishable by Bishops, then
common equity requires that Emperors have the benefit of a faire
hearing and arraignment, or else were their condition more mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
than the condition of the meanest vassals: for as Princes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
are more inscrutible, and their counsels more mysticall; so
also their ends are for the most part more lyable to envy, and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interpretation:
It is not possible for you without due discussion,
inquiry, and examination of impartiall witnesses, perfectly to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
all the true circumstances, reasons, and grounds of this
my fa<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>; and without this understanding it is not possible for
you to pronounce a just censure against me. It's necessary then
that some Tribunall be prepared for you, and some Barre for me,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:61021:20"/>
that upright Sentence may passe, and that Iustice may be done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandingly,
and upon this it must needs follow that I am your
meere Subject, and must lay down my Scepter to bow my selfe
under your Crosier, till this difficulty be fully ended. Admit
this also, and then you may use what procrastination you please in
this intricate decision; or in the like manner question mee of all
other enormities, and scandalous deviations, which rumor, envy,
or treason it selfe forges against me; and thus shall I have no lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to judge other men, it will be scarce possible for me to acquit
my selfe in judgment from other men: that power which God
hath put into my hands for the protection of so many Myriads,
will be utterly disabled by that higher power which is put into
your hands over me. By the same reason also that I am to render
an account to you in this place, I am to render the like to all your
superiours, equals, or inferiours in other jurisdictions, of all sins
whatsoever, whether reall, or imputable, Ecclesiasticall, or Civil,
so that no end is like to be of my tryals, purgations, or condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>You will say, my crime is sensibly evident; if I would deny
this, you could not prove it so; and if I would not confesse this,
you could not force me, for it was a politicall thing, and farre off
acted: and my meere confession can give to you no Iurisdiction.
But be my crime as manifest in it selfe as the disobedience of <hi>Saul</hi>
was to <hi>Samuel,</hi> or as <hi>Davids</hi> murther was to <hi>Nathan,</hi> or as <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons</hi>
incontinence was to all the World, or as <hi>Manasses</hi> his
Idolatry: yet why should I suffer more than they? What new
coercive, vindicative authority have Priests gained over Princes
by Christs Gospel, which the Iewish Priests never used, claymed,
or heard of? If Excommunication, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be now necessary, sure
it was in use before Christ; and then we should have heard of
some Kings Excommunicated, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by some Priests; for if the
Temporall power had not of its owne nature a competent force
and habitude to restraine all things repugnant to publique quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and honesty, a Spirituall power was necessary; and
yet we read of none such. But if there was a sufficiency in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
power, as is most manifestly apparent; then wee cannot
imagine that Christ came to take away any of this authority from
Magistrates: but that power which he added, was rather an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61021:21"/>
of grace and vertue in matters of Faith, and illumination.</p>
            <p>It cannot be alleadged by you, that that punishment is meerely
spirituall, and so no politicall evill: for as it puts other men into
the condition of Publicans, Heathens, and worse; so it further
yet degrades, disables and oppresses Princes. How shall he be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored
and obeyed as the Vicegerent of God in all causes, whom
the Layty sees ejected out of the Church, and expelled out of the
Communion of the Faithfull, as a rotten contagious member?
How shall hee be held more sacred than a Priest, whom the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
interdiction, and the confounding blow of a Priests spiritual
execration, shall render so contemptible, miserable and abominable
in the eyes of the world?</p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> being accused in matters of Doctrine, made his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale
to a wicked Heathen Emperor; and yet now a Christian
godly Emperor being accused by any Church-man, no appeale is
allowed, though in meere civill accusations. S. <hi>Peters</hi> Keyes did
either induce some new power not before known unto the world,
or not; if it did, then our Saviours Gospell came into the world
to the detriment of civill government, which is contrary to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and all reason: and if no new addition of power were
imported, then <hi>Tiberius</hi> himselfe, though a Heathen, and Tyrant,
remained as absolute as before; and yet in his time there was
more necessity of an Ecclesiasticall judicature, than is now. But
you will say, if Princes be not subject to some chastisement, then
some scandals must passe unremediable. Not so, for here God is
the revenger, and strikes often, as he did <hi>Vzziah;</hi> but if not, yet
either the Temporall or Spirituall Governour must passe uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiz'd,
which is all one; for two Supreames cannot be, nor no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
Government without some supremacy, nor no supremacy
without immunity, and exemption from judgement.</p>
            <p>The perpetuall conflicts and contestations betweene Princes
and Prelats, which are likely to ensue, will soone cleere this; that
either Princes must at last submit to the tribunals of Church-men,
and raigne at their discretion; or else Church-men must submit to
them: For both Tribunals cannot stand compatible. For my part,
I excuse so grave a Father as you are, of ambition herein; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I am the lesse cautious in summiting my selfe at this time:
but I conceive this Doctrine may bee the ground of dangerous
consequences to others, and therefore I desire it may not
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61021:21"/>
from mee passe into a president for the time to come.</p>
            <p>Let not proud Prelates from this my voluntary humiliation,
arrogate to themselves as if it had been due; or derogate thereby
from the more sacred order of Princes: neither let Princes from
this particular learne to yeeld to any Spirituall Monarchy what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever.
My beliefe is, that the Prince is the Head, the Fountaine,
the Soule of all power whatsoever, Spirituall, or Temporall;
wherein he ought not to indure at all any kind of rivality of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall
persons, nor can admit of any diminution in any part
of his Iurisdiction, without offence to God, dammage to his
charge, and danger to himselfe. So much for <hi>Theodosius,</hi> and so
much for that Iurisdiction, which is due to Prelats: I should now
speake of the exercise thereof, as it is granted by the favour of
Princes, but this is a very tender point.</p>
            <p>It seemes to some, that Princes ought not to incumber men in
Sacred Orders, in any kind of judicature which is not purely spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall;
nor that Prelates can accept of any Temporall imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
whatsoever, without dishonour to their Orders, and neglect
to their cure of Soules: and yet now none so greedy of such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment.
A sacred place may not be put to secular uses, that's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane:
but a sacred person may, that's honorable.</p>
            <p>A Bishoprick now adayes is but a Writ of ease, to dismisse from
Preaching, and attending Gods service; whereby the man is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
from the Church to the Court, from the Altar to some Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunall,
from Gods Spirituall to the Kings Temporall affaires. In
the High Commission, at the Councell Table, in the Star-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and the Chequer, Church-men are now more active than in
their own Consistories, and yet their ambition further aimes (as
'tis said) to the Chancery, Court of Requests, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which could
not chuse but redound to the scandall of Religion, the obstructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Iustice, and vexation of the Subject: if there were not lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and skilful men enough in Policy and Law to serve the King,
unlesse Divinity were deprived of some of her followers, there
were some seeming umbrage why the King might borrow of God;
as in the shady times of Popery it was usuall: when all learning
was as it were ingrossed by the Clergy, and purloyned from the
Layty: but when the clouds of universall Ignorance are now
dispelled as well from the Layty as Clergy; now the Clergy are
not so necessary in temporall affaires, unlesse we judge it fit that
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61021:22"/>
Gods more Holy Offices should be neglected, for this purpose on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that the Kings meaner businesse may be worse administred.</p>
            <p>The functions of Divines are too sacred for any secular person
to officiate, and therefore it should seeme, their persons also ought
to be too sacred for secular functions; for it seemes prepostrous,
that it should be thought an honour to Priests to relinquish spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall,
and adhere to temporall imployments. <hi>Nic. Machiavell</hi>
did observe that Christian Religion had long since falne to the
ground, had not the regular strictnesse of poore inferiour Priests
and Pryers held, and propped up the reputation of it in the world,
as much as the Pride and Luxury of the great Cardinals, and
Princelike Bishops, did strive to sinke and demolish it. The same
observation holds true amongst us Protestants at this day, for the
more our Prelats enjoy, the more still they seeke; and all our
three Kingdomes are growne so sick of their Pride, Injustice, and
Pragmaticall faction, that scarce any remedy but bloud-letting
can cure them. Wee finde in Scripture the most High and Holy
Offices of Religion performed by Princes, even amongst, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the greatest of Priests; but wee scarce finde any instance at
all where Priests intermedled with any State affaires, either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,
or under Princes: and yet with us now the imploying and
entrusting of Clergy-men in Temporall businesses, is held as po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litique
as it was in times of Popery: although no time could e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
justly boast of that use. But to passe over Temporall businesses,
how violent have our Bishops beene in their own Canons about
Ceremonies, and indifferencies? and what disturbance hath that
violence produced? They strive as for the beauty and glory of
Religion, to bring in the same formes of Liturgy, the same po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
of the Communion-Table, the same gesture at the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> in all our three Dominions; as if uniformity were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
beautifull: and yet we see, all men are created with severall
faces, voyces, and complexions, without any deformity to the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse.</p>
            <p>'Tis not externall variety, but internall dissention, which
spoyles the harmony of Religion; and dissention is more nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the harshnesse of Pastors over their flocks, especially over the
weake ones in scruples, than by permitting various Rites and
Formes in the externall worship of God. Certainly, liberty and
variety in indifferences, and Ceremonies is more favour'd in
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61021:22"/>
Scripture, than any universall similitude, or rigorous force what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,
over the perplexed, anxious consciences of weake men. We
see in <hi>Scotland,</hi> where there is no Ceremonies, they enjoy that u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niformity
without contention, which we ayme at only, and seeke
to purchase with infinite debate, and persecution; and under their
peace and unity, the Protestant Religion thrives, and Romish
Superstition utterly ceases: whereas under our strife and disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement,
Religion and true Devotion is over-run, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown,
like Corne choaked with weeds. Nay, it is thought that
if our Bishops had been more gentle-handed all this while to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
such as dis-relish't Ceremonies for Poperies sake, and had
rather pitied them as men of tender consciences, than persecuted
and defamed them, as seditious <hi>Puritans,</hi> these differences had
not lasted so long: for when the Reformation was not yet fully
perfected, the <hi>Puritans</hi> of those dayes were more fiery than now;
but not being so odious in the Church, lesse combustion followed
thereupon: whereas now they are so unmercifully treated, that no
moderate complyance can serve the turne.</p>
            <p>There seemes now little remaining of <hi>Puritanisme,</hi> but the
breathlesse carkasse of it, and yet till that too be interred and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed,
no truce can be admitted. The very sufferings of <hi>Puritans</hi>
now are sufficient guilt, and imputed as the effects of their owne
malice, their punishment is argument enough for the desert of
their punishment; the more they have borne, the more they must
now beare; and the more they now beare, the more they shall
hereafter. Fury is one of the maine things objected to <hi>Puritans;</hi>
but in truth, the World has not any thing more furious than such
as most pretend against them.</p>
            <p>Hence it is, that the hatred of <hi>Puritans</hi> flowes and descends
from the Highest of the Clergy to the lowest: and young Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
in the Vniversity know it now their wisest course to Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
the defamation of <hi>Puritans,</hi> as the first and most necessary
point of their Learning and qualification, and as their surest path
to promotion. And to make their detestation sure, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
irreconciliable, they must ingage themselves by some no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
service of novelty, quarrelling with some point of <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantisme,</hi>
or refining some point of <hi>Popery;</hi> they must taxe <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants</hi>
as some wayes injurious to Princes, or extoll <hi>Papists</hi> as
zealous observers of Antiquity. It must be maintained that royalty
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61021:23"/>
cannot stand without the prop of Episcopacy, though it never
yet found greater enemy; and that Puritanisme only hinders the
stretching of our Religion, or else Papists and we should soon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.
Those of vulgar wits which serve not for such straines, that
they may bee redeemed from suspicion of Puritanisme, must do
something factiously, or be vitious, or else their hopes of prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
are almost desperate.</p>
            <p>Charity to Papists, conformity to Ancient Fathers, and decent
uniformity amongst our selves, are the specious colours where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they dresse and deck all their pretences; for want of Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
living in these dayes, they racke out of their tombes <hi>Hacket,
Copinger, Brown,</hi> &amp;c. to upbraid us, for want of opposites enow
here in <hi>England,</hi> they calumniate the <hi>Scots</hi> to our dishonor; for
want of true imputations, they forge any crimes how monstrous
soever, and their most sure one is, that which is most undiscer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nible,
hypocrisie. Neverthelesse it must be believed that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipuritan
disparages not our Ancestors in the Reformation, but
for love of Antiquity; nor teares in sunder the bonds of Religion
Nature, Policy betwixt two the most close-united Nations of
the World, but out of love to unite: nor fils whole Kingdomes
with bloud, but out of love to Order. Such was sure <hi>Diogenes</hi>
his humility, trampling upon <hi>Plato's</hi> Couches; such was <hi>Nero's</hi>
uniformity, setting on fire the streets of <hi>Rome;</hi> such was <hi>Procru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes</hi>
his symmetry, cutting his guests according to his beds. And
therefore its thought <hi>Puritans</hi> are not so much hated for their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to Ceremonies, as Ceremonies are multiplied, and infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
for suppression of all zealous Christians, under the umbrage of
<hi>Puritans:</hi> and that for the same purpose the enemies of Piety have
blown those coales which they might have quenched.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hooker</hi> that sweet and noble Antagonist of Ecclesiasticall <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans</hi>
says much in defence of the Churches authority in impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of Ceremonies, but he says nothing in defence of the
Churches Charity in imposing many, and displeasing Ceremonies.
So S. <hi>Paul</hi> might have justified himselfe, as fitter to be subscribed
unto and complyed withall then his scrupulous brother, and
he might have justified his case concerning eating of such and
such meates: but S. <hi>Paul</hi> in wisdome, and Charity, would doe
neither. S. <hi>Paul</hi> made not his strength an Argument to make
his brother yeeld who was weake, but he made his brothers

weaknesse an Argument whereby to prevaile and win upon
him being strong. And why then does our Mother the Church
maintaine her authority against her own scrupulous and tender-minded
infants? If in Iustice and rigor they ought to obey her,
and conforme to her wise commands; does it therefore follow
that in Wisdome and Charity she ought not to pity, and preferre
their foolish, groundlesse doubts and jealousies? Is it honorable
for the Nurce to contest about authority with a forward Childe,
when by indulgence she may better still it? If Ceremonies bee
but things indifferent, they are not so valuable, as peace, for that
is necessary. Admit fit and decent Ceremonies to bee the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>workes
of Religion, the better to secure it from contempt, and
prophanation: Yet let not the outworks be too vast, least they
take up more admiration, than they repulse disregard. Neither
let us suppose that all times are alike liable to prophanenesse. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Moses,</hi> Religion was very naked and simple in her Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
and yet we must not thinke that God did then make ill
provision, or was carelesse of the government of his Church; but
under the Law, Ceremonies were strangely multiplyed to the
Iews, and that by Gods owne appoyntment; and yet in those
times, I cannot thinke that any Discipline could bee invented
more honorable for Religion. I shall desire therefore to walke
between two extremes, neither wholy condemning all Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
as superstitious, nor embracing many as necessary, besides
the Ceremonious use of water in Baptisme, and of Bread and
Wine in the Eucharist; the Gospell recommends no externall
rites, but such as the generall rules of decency inclose, to our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation:
but it seemes utterly to discountenance all Iewish,
carnall ordinances; yet certainly if multiplicity of pompous ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
had been very usefull where knowledge abounds, and to
be look't upon as the outworks of Religion, the Gospell would
not have been so silent as it is concerning them. Were we now
to plant a Church in the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> amongst rude Salvages, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
the externall splendour of our worship might bee as conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
as it was amongst the Iews to attract Proselytes: Or had
we now such a dreadfull presence of God residing amongst us,
as the Iews had in their <hi>Oracle,</hi> perhaps Musick Vocall, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentall,
and Statelinesse of attire, and fearefulnesse in our Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures,
and Postures would beseeme us in our solemn addresses and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:61021:24"/>
Festivall celebrations: but the difference betwixt these times
and those, and these Christian Countreys, and those that are Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
is very great. What manner of Divine Service the <hi>French
Protestants</hi> and the <hi>Scots</hi> use, and some other Nations I cannot tell,
but I hope it is not so nasty, and slovenly as some of our <hi>Formalists</hi>
would make us believe: for it seemes not impossible to me, but
that in times of so much Light, as these are, God may be very ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably
and zealously served without many Stately Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</p>
            <p>The Bishop of <hi>Downe</hi> makes a very sharpe speech to the <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi>

wondred at that the King thinkes ill of his subjects, or that <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
or <hi>Prin</hi> suffered worse than Traytors merits. Its rather to
be wondred at, that our streets do not runne with bloud dayly,
since this is the Gospell our Reverend Fathers of the Church
preach.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This Speech was thought worthy to bee dispersed in Print o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
all our Kingdomes in</hi> English; <hi>but since, because it redounds
so much to the honour of the three Nations, and the repute of</hi>
Protestant Religion, <hi>its Translated into Latine, and Coppies are
Printed for all Christendome to take notice of. In this Speech
its urged,</hi> that <hi>Puritans,</hi> who began about 80 yeares since, have
proceeded from bad to worse by sixe degrees; first they did dislike,
then contemne Bishops; then they did disobey their Jurisdiction; then
separate themselves; then they fell into the Heresie of holding no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between Bishop and Presbyter: lastly, they rebelled, and grew
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:61021:24"/>
more immoderate than <hi>Anabaptists: And here S.</hi> Cyprian <hi>is alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,</hi>
who says, that the contempt of Bishops is the beginning and ground
of all Heresies and Schismes.</p>
            <p>Here we see what <hi>Puritans</hi> are, the most cursed Miscreants on
earth; next we see who <hi>Puritans</hi> are, all such as hold not with
Episcopacy: that is in probability halfe <hi>Ireland,</hi> more than halfe
<hi>England,</hi> all <hi>Scotland,</hi> and many other <hi>Protestant</hi> Countryes.

fraudulently sought to perturbe the State, and make a factious se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration.
But here the difference of all <hi>Puritans</hi> is graduall only,
not substantiall: for dislike of Bishops is the beginning of all <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie,</hi>
and must needs end in <hi>Anabaptisme</hi> and rebellion.</p>

               </gap>es it here appeare, that Episcopacy is the true
<hi>Helena</hi> of all this war; and yet S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> is to bee understood of
the Pastorall function, not of the Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction of a
Bishop, or else in his sense the <hi>Genevans,</hi> and the greatest part of
<hi>Protestants</hi> are <hi>Heretiques,</hi> and King <hi>James</hi> made a frivolous di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction.</p>
            <p>Such stuffe as this had not mis-beseemed a <hi>Papist,</hi> but its very
odde in a <hi>Protestant</hi> Bishop; except we consider him, as one
who hath lookt back towards the <hi>Onions</hi> and <hi>Flesh-pots</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi>
and is inamored againe upon those glorious Titles and Ensignes
of Honour and Pompe, which <hi>Rome</hi> confers upon her Courtiers.</p>
            <p>But to conclude this point, I wish Princes would not allow
such Bishops to be carvers to themselves, and make them Iudges
in cases of their owne interesse: they are surely good spectacles
for Princes in Theologicall deliberations, as Temporall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors
are in State affaires; but miserable are those Princes whose
eyes cannot see without such spectacles. If Religion did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper
worse, if peace were not more violated, if persecution were
not more common in Countreys where Bishops governe, than
where they are expelled, we might suspect the <hi>Scots</hi> as Hereticall
and rebellious by nature; for chusing all the plagues of war rather
than Bishops: but when we see the contrary, we may as well li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten
to the <hi>Scots</hi> against Bishops, as to Bishops against the <hi>Scots.</hi>

There are many men amongst us now, which brooke Bishops
and Ceremonies well enough; and perhaps favourably interpret
our late innovations: and yet these may bee too grave to escape
the name of <hi>Puritans.</hi> To be a <hi>Protestant</hi> may be allowed, but to
dispute against <hi>Papists,</hi> smels of precisenesse: to hold the <hi>Pope</hi> fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
is tollerated, but to hold him <hi>Antichrist,</hi> is abominable <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritanisme:</hi>
to go to Church is fashionable, but to complaine
of the <hi>Masse,</hi> or to be grieved at the publique countenance of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,</hi>
whereby it intwines our Religion, and now drinkes up that

how farre some of our Divines are hereat conniving<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
if not cooperating, is a symptome of a deepe infected <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He that is not moderate in Religion, is a <hi>Puritan,</hi> and he that
is not a <hi>Cassandrian,</hi> or of Father <hi>Francis Synclers</hi> faith, is not
moderate: he favours too much of <hi>Calvins</hi> grosse learning, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded
now by our finest wits.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi> professes, that he stands much amazed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the magnificence of Churches built by our Ancestors, we their
Successors being scarce able to keep up the same: but that hee is
farther beside himselfe with exceeding marvaile, when he casts his
eyes back upon the excellent ground-worke of Religion laid by
our Fathers in the Reformation, and yet sees the same so ill built
upon, and so negligently seconded by us their children: But
this (he says) is not to be attributed to the hanging up of <hi>Pius 5.</hi>
his Bull upon the Bishop of <hi>Londons</hi> gate, or to that favour which
has been shewd to Priests, but it is the idlenes, and insufficiency of
many of our own teachers, conspiring with the peoples cold zeale,
that has wrought this apostacy. The Name of <hi>Recusant</hi> was
scarce known till the II. of Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> the <hi>Marian</hi> persequuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
being yet fresh in memory, and great zeale being begotten
thereby, and the finger-worke of God being so apparent in the
suddaine alteration of Religion. Then did the Layty and Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
with holy emulation, strive who should shew themselves most
affectionate to the Gospell: then were our Ministers as frequent
in great mens houses, and as active as <hi>Jesuites</hi> now are: then
were Praying and Preaching both equally pretious to great and
small. The name of <hi>Papist</hi> smelt then ranke even to themselves,
all sorts resorting dayly to Church, to avoyd the shame thereof,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:61021:25"/>
untill Arch-bishop <hi>Grindals</hi> disgrace, and <hi>Hatfields</hi> hard conceit
of Prophecies, brought the flowing of these good graces to a still
water: But when <hi>Sanders</hi> the <hi>Coripbeus</hi> of Catholicks had slily
pinned the Name of <hi>Puritans</hi> upon all such as were most forward
in encouraging, and couragious in opposing Catholiques, and
when he perceived that the word was pleasing to some ill affected
of our own side; He quickly heated some of us beyond the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of discretion. And now with the crosse tumults of both fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
in extreme choler vented in Pulpits, and Pamphlets, most
men grew to be frozen in zeale, and so benummed, that whosever
(as the worthy L. Keep. <hi>Bacon</hi> observed) in those days pretended a
little sparke of earnestnesse, seemed red-fire-hot in respect of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
Thus it betided <hi>Protestants,</hi> as those which fare the worse
for ill neighbours, for whilst they curbe <hi>Papists,</hi> or reproove idle
drones, they are incontinently branded with the ignominious
name of Precisians.</p>
            <p>See here Sir <hi>Robert Cottons</hi> Iudgement, as touching the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and originall of our Religious <hi>Puritans:</hi> and see also his cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of the State, as touching the same: For where hee taxes the
indiscreete zeale of those who were so violently incensed at <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
his nickname, so maliciously and subtilly fastened upon them
there in his Margin, his Note is this; If these mens zeale had
beene imployed otherwise, and a taske set them to do some good,
they might have been reformed, or made harmelesse by diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
            <p>But I passe from this kind of <hi>Puritan</hi> to another, whom I shall
call my Political <hi>Puritan;</hi> for the bounds of <hi>Puritanisme</hi> are yet
larger, and inclose men of other conditions.</p>
            <p>Some there are yet which perhaps disfavour not at all ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Ecclesiasticall Policy, or moderate <hi>Papists;</hi> and yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse
this is not sufficient to acquit them from the name of <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans,</hi>
if they ascribe any thing to the Laws and Liberties of this
Realme, or hold the Prerogative Royall to be limitable by any
Law whatsoever.</p>
            <p>If they hold not against <hi>Parliaments</hi> and with <hi>Ship-money,</hi> they
are injurious to Kings; and to be injurious to Kings, is <hi>propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um

<hi>Puritan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> are <hi>Puritans,</hi> and therefore enemies to Monarchy, the

both the Nations have been hitherto famous for their devout re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence,
and obsequious zeale to their Princes; but now <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritanisme</hi>
has infected them, and perverted them to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyalty.</p>
            <p>Thus is the Kings heart alienated from his Subjects, and by
consequence, the Subjects loyalty blunted towards him, to the
incomparable, almost irreparable detriment of both: neither is

the <hi>Recusant</hi> faction. <hi>Papists</hi> have now gotten the repute of the
best Subjects, and fittest for trust in places of eminent service;
nay 'tis almost necessary that forraine <hi>Papists</hi> be brought in for the
supporting of the indangered Royalty: for though the <hi>Popish</hi>
faction at Court be strong and active enough for matter of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell,
yet for matter of force, the <hi>Puritans</hi> in City and Countrey be

               <hi>The Bishop of</hi> Downe in his visitation speech layes all the calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

charging withall that rebellion upon <hi>Puritanisme.</hi> The first thing
<hi>(says he)</hi> that made me out of love with that Religion, was their inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
dealing with Kings, which I observed both in their Practice and
Doctrine. <hi>Hee taxes</hi> first their Doctrine, <hi>because they deny the
Kings supremacy in causes Ecclesiasticall, and allow Subjects to
resist, nay and depose their King, if he be a Tyrant Surely</hi> Ahab
<hi>could say little for himselfe, if he could not lay his owne crimes

            </p>
            <p>King <hi>James</hi> spoke not so confusedly as if <hi>Puritanisme</hi> were a

I would desire him to prove all Covenanters <hi>Puritans;</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyers
of the Kings supremacy: or to instance in any Kings
which have been deposed or murthred by Presbyteriall authority.
How far Bishops have incroached upon Kings, is knowne to all
the world: our <hi>Protestant</hi> Bishops lately have by Oath and
Canon, combined together to bind the Kings hands, though
hee bee Supreme, that hee shall not governe our Church but
by Arch-bishops, Bishops, Arch-deacons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And yet these
troublers of <hi>Israel</hi> have the face to taxe <hi>Elijah</hi> of their own
sinne.</p>
            <p>Presbytery indeed has heretofore passed her bounds, yet not of
late, but Episcopacy has ever from <hi>Constantine</hi> claimed an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance
of Divine right, till this instant. I conceive there are
not in all the Kings Dominions, three men, except <hi>Papists</hi> and
<hi>Anabaptists,</hi> which hold it lawfull to depose, or by any force to
violate the persons of Kings, how ill soever. The <hi>Scotch</hi> Divines
indeed maintaine that a great body of men may defend themselvs
against the unjust sword of misled Kings, because they cannot fly,
or otherwise save themselves; and this they take now to be their
own case; whereas our Court Divines in <hi>England</hi> hold, that in
such case, we ought all to yeeld our throats without defence. This
seemes unnaturall, and truth was never unnaturall, but I forbeare
to dispute a point so horrid to mans imagination.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Bishop</hi> next instances in the rebellious practices of Puritans, &amp;
reckons up some Fasts in <hi>Scotland</hi> appointed by the Presbytery, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nstance
is in the present <hi>Scotch</hi> insurrection; this he cals a rebellion of <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi>
and far greater than the Powder-treason: <hi>For (says he)</hi> that
plot was but the act of a few discontented Gentlemen, but in this rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
of the <hi>Puritans</hi> they have ingaged a great part of the Kingdome,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:61021:27"/>
so that this may be said to be the common sin of that Sect. <hi>What could
have beene raked out of Hell more slanderous to our Religion,
more Apologeticall for</hi> Popery?</p>
            <p>The Powder-Traytors are here preferred before the whole sect
of <hi>Puritans:</hi> The sin of the Powder-Traytors was, that they being
but an inconsiderable party, sought the destruction of their King
and his issue, and the flower of the Nobility, Gentry, Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty,
and the extirpation of the true Religion, by a most diaboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
bloudy practice and conspiracy. And it ought not to be charged
upon the meere actors, as a symptome of discontent, onely wee
know how far the <hi>Romish</hi> Religion it selfe favours and gives
ground to such damned feats, and how far it has owned some ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
proved prosperous, and justified the doing thereof in nature
as impious, though perhaps in degree not so hainous as this. For
take this as it was conspired, and questionlesse, since the crucify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Iesus Christ, the Light never discovered any treason more
ugly and horrible.</p>
            <p>Now to out-match this deed of darknesse, the <hi>Scotch</hi> Nation by
a strange general unanimity have armed themselves to oppose the
ill government of Bishops, and other alterations in the service of
God, and the administration of Iustice, and being invaded there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by another Nation, have used force to defend their lives; and
seeing that defence not safe in their owne Countrey, they have
since pursued it further by way of prevention in the Country of
their Invaders.</p>
            <p>That is the greatest act of Rebellion whereby the common
Peace and safety of a Kingdome is most disturbed and impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
but by the common act of a whole Kingdome, that mischiefe
cannot be effected: therefore the Bishop failes in his politiques
when he thinkes that the <hi>Major</hi> part disturbing the <hi>Minor,</hi> is
more trayterous, than the contrary.</p>
            <p>The unanimous act of a whole Kingdome ought to bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
to bee lesse injurious, and more wise than the act of any
small inconsiderable party, for it hath scarce ever been seen that a
whole Kingdome, or the majority thereof hath ever been treaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
to its selfe in procuring its own ruine.</p>
            <p>Many States have perisht by the machinations of a few ill-af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
ill-advised Counsellors, (scarce ever any perisht other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise)
but the totall body and collection has never been guilty of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:61021:27"/>
its owne ruine: and if it were, such Treason could not be so great
as that which is plotted by a few. Whilst the <hi>Scots</hi> contained
themselves within their owne territories, and were considered
as a kingdome within themselves, as they were when the Bishop
past his censure, they were not rightly so censured: neither was
he then privy to their intrusions, that they would infest our king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
with the same combustion, and so prove a disturbance to
the greater part of our British Monarchy, whereof they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
are but a member of lesse bulke and value. Cursed therefore
are those uncharitable exasperating censurers, whereby the King
is too far incensed, and by whose rash instigations the commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
themselves become the harder to be appeased.</p>
            <p>Great insurrections are like great fires, wherein delay is mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous,
and small remedies rather turne to fuell, then extinguish:
and violent counsell against an inraged multitude, is like oyle, or
pitch cast into the flame. The wise politician proportions his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
according to the mischiefe, if water will not prevaile, he
useth milke; if a little quantity will not suffice, he powres as the
combustion it selfe requires. Vnfortunate <hi>Rehoboam</hi> stands as a
Seamarke to warne all Princes how to shun this rocke of violent
counsell against a people violently inraged and aggrieved. Some
men have interpreted the designes of the <hi>Scots</hi> to have been trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
from the beginning, and wholy bent upon the spoyle and
havocke of the English Nation from their first stirring: Others
have wholly justified their intentions and proceedings hitherto
as defensive only, and inforced by necessity: both these, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
are too rash and head-long in their guesses. In so great a
body of men, there must needs be variety of opinions, and its
likely contrariety of affections; and therefore it behoves the King
to be the more tender, moderate, and circumspect in his delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as well for the one side as the other, especially since the
<hi>Scots</hi> have not evidently and universally as yet declared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
for the worse. We may at once be charitable in hoping the
best, and wise withall in preventing the worst; nay, a charitable
and sweet demeanor, if it be not too fond, may prove a great part
of our prevention: doubtlesse <hi>Rehoboam</hi> himselfe, had he not been
wilfully devoted to yong, rash, and violent Counsellors, might
have easily retained within his obedience many of his well-mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Subjects, and reclaimed others of more moderation; and by
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:61021:28"/>
that meanes have divided and dissipated the most obstinate,
headstrong, and furious of all the rebellious party. Some Princes
thinke themselves bound in Honour to do unwise things, and this
was the error of <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> his aged Counsellours advised him to
that which was most politick, concluding that to be most honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable;
but his <hi>Genius</hi> rather led him according to the advise of his
young Gallants, to conclude that most politick, which to his
haughty stomack seemed most honorable: but what was the event?
to avoid the scorn of young men, he incurred the scorn of old men;
to avoid the unjust censure of fooles, he incurred the just censure of
wise men; to gaine the honor of appearing stout, he purchased the
dishonour of being rash; to shew a contempt of danger he made
himself a prey to it; rather then to decline a blow by a gentle bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his body, he yeelded himself to be inevitably oppressed by it.</p>
            <p>At this time of revolt the <hi>Israelites</hi> were not so wicked, as their
revolt after made them; it may be so with the <hi>Scots,</hi> they are yet
<hi>Protestants,</hi> and perhaps may be retained so: and who can thinke
of <hi>Protestants,</hi> that so great a body of them, can at one fall so despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
tumble into the depth of mischiefe, as to make Fasting,
Praying, Oaths and Sacraments, meere instruments and traines
to commit murther, theft, sacriledge, treason, and the most unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
of all crying crimes? But to returne to our owne Nation,
and what we suffer by our owne Divine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Manwarings</hi> Doctrine is common at Court, and 'tis not long
since a Byshops Chaplaine in Tearme-time, challenged a Iudge of
Treason, for delivering Law according to conscience. And this is
now no prodigie, for Pulpits are not publike enough to preach
an unlimitable prerogative in; 'tis fit our learned Doctors should
mount the Benches of Iustice also; there to advance Logicke
instead of Law; for Law is growne injurious to Princes, and
smels ranke of <hi>Puritanisme.</hi> Divines themselves will loose nothing
to Princes, but all other men shall, that they may gaine the more:
and neither Lawyers nor States-men must direct them in any
thing, but both Lawyers and States-men must be directed by
them in all things: but let us a little examine how the conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
and absolute formes of government come within the circle
of Theologie. The <hi>Israelites</hi> were governed by Monarchs, but not
all alike absolute. The Patriarchs were not so absolute as the Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
nor the Iudges as the Kings, nor the Kings as those Heathen
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:61021:28"/>
Emperours, which at last made them tributary. The due of <hi>Caesar,</hi>
and the due of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and the due of <hi>Samuel,</hi> and the due of
<hi>Jacob,</hi> was not the same as to all points of State, or all degrees of
Royalty, and yet the nation was the same, and the forme of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
still remained the same: <hi>viz.</hi> monarchicall.</p>
            <p>It should seeme that God approved that degree of Soveraignty
best, which was by himselfe setled in the person of <hi>Moses,</hi> for
when that people afterwards desired a King, of a more awfull
and large prerogative, in imitation of other Nations, the thing
displeased God. <hi>Samuel</hi> also wrote a book of this subject, shewing
the just conditions of Regall power; (the losse whereof is much
to be lamented) for if it had been Gods will that all Kings should
be equally absolute in all respects, and free from all limitations
and obligations alike, <hi>Samuel</hi> needed to have written little
thereof; one word had determined all. But in Scripture, as it
now remaines, <hi>Samuels</hi> booke being not extant, our chiefest light
and guide now is by example, not rule; and example we finde
very various.</p>
            <p>The State and Soveraignty of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Kings in generall, we
find mild, and gratious; but much differing in particulars. <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
was heavy over his Subjects, and under his Son they would
not beare the like; yet <hi>Solomons</hi> pressure was not upon the estates
of his Subjects by taxes, and impositions, for He made silver in
<hi>Jerusalem</hi> as stones for plenty; nor did He vex their persons by
Military hazzards and services, for He was at peace with all the
world: Neither did He any way let fall, or lessen their honour
amongst other Nations; He made them rather a spectacle of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and prosperity to the world. <hi>Solomons</hi> harshnesse was onely in
imploying so great multitudes for his own pompous attendance,
and for the performance of such publike workes, and structures, as
did tend to the Magnificence and beauty of the State. Besides,
Scripture does not satisfie us, neither by rule, nor example, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Kings ought to be successive alwayes, or elective; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
primogeniture of Males, or unigeniture of Daughters, ought
to take place: many things are left so uncertaine, that it is not
alwayes safe for Kings wholly to rely upon examples; and for
the rule of obedience, it is generall, and no more advantagious for
free Monarchs, than conditionate Potentates; no more for su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame,
than subordinate commanders.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:61021:29"/>
The Law of Nature best determines, that all Princes being
publike Ministers for the common good, that their authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
ought to be of sufficient latitude for that common good; and
since Scripture is not expresse concerning that latitude, as to all
people, the same not being to all alike necessary, the severall Laws
of severall Countries best teach that certaine latitude. I could wish
therefore that Princes herein would not so much consult with
Divines, as Lawyers; or rather with Parliaments, which are the
grand Courts and Counsells of Kingdomes; for (as <hi>Cotton</hi> saies)
Every man in particular may deceive, and be deceived; but no
man can deceive all, nor can all deceive one. Ancient times are
not precedentary to ours by any necessity, for Lawes are now
more learned, exact, and particular; and Courts and Tables of
Iustice, and Policy, are more wisely and methodically composed
and elected, then they were; and therefore there needs not that
vocall power, or indisputable force to remaine in the breasts of
Princes, as was of old.</p>
            <p>The Courts of Parliament, and their unquestionable Acts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
Ordinances, and their infallible avisoes, are now in all well-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
Countries, the very Oracles of all Policy, and Law, they
are the fountaines of civill bloud, spirits, and life; and the sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
antidots of publike mischiefes. That Prince was never yet
deceived which relied upon them, nor can he chuse but be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
which thinkes he can be assisted with any more wise or
faithfull advertisement, then that which is given him by his
whole Realme united, and contracted in a lesse circumference.
What end can all the flower of the Nobility, Gentry, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty
of a Nation, being wise and religious, have in seducing
their Soveraigne, or in limiting that Soveraignty, by which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
they are protected? Or what one party of particular men
can better understand the true limits of sufficient Soveraignty,
and the profit thereof; then this collective universality, whole
rayes like the Suns, are every where dispersed; and yet whose bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of light is here as in a refulgent Globe concentred?</p>
            <p>Individualls may have many particular ends, severed from the
Princes or the States, but Communities can ayme at nothing but
the common good; as the lesser fountaines scatter their branching
streames up and downe in various Maeanders, whilst the Sea con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
it selfe in an intire body, within its constant bounds.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:61021:29"/>
Individuals also have but their owne particular set limit of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
and have judgements beside apt to be darkened by their
owne severall interests and passions; whereas the common body
enjoyes a confluence of severall perfections, and hath the lesse
force from abroad to overcloud them. Of all men therefore it will
most concerne Princes to suspect them which are enemies to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
assemblies, and to confide in them most, whose ends are not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
from the generalities; and as they tender their owne hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse,
to expect it chiefly from that generality, by which they
are Kings, to which they are Gods, from which their very Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dems
receive honour and sanctity, to which their very Royall
Order imparts life, and breath, and necessary subsistence. I come
now to my Ethicall <hi>Puritan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The name of <hi>Puritan</hi> must not rest here, for there may be some
moderate, well inclined, facile men, whose education may be
such that they are not much vers'd or insighted either in matters
of Religion, or matters of State; they may be such as are no waies
busie but in their own particular affaires, and yet it behooves that
these men too be brought in within the opprobrious compasse
of <hi>Puritanisme.</hi> To the Religious, Ecclesiasticall, and Politicall
<hi>Puritan,</hi> there must be joyned also an Ethicall <hi>Puritan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This detested odious name of <hi>Puritan</hi> first began in the
Church presently after the Reformation, but now it extends it
selfe further, and gaining strength as it goes, it diffuses its poyso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
ignominy further, and being not contended to Gangrene
Religion, Ecclesiasticall and Civill policy, it now threatens de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
to all morality also. The honest strict demeanour, and
civill conversation which is so eminent in some men does so
upbraid and convince the <hi>Antipuritan,</hi> that even honesty, strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and civility it selfe must become disgracefull, or else they
which are contrary cannot remaine in grace: But because it is
too grosse to deride vertue under the name of vertue; therefore
other colours are invented, and so the same thing undergoes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rision
under another name. The zealous man is despised under the
name of zealot, the Religious honest man has the vizard of an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite,
and dissembler put upon him to make him odious.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Here I may alledge even</hi> Hooker <hi>himselfe in justification of this
Ethicall</hi> Puritan, <hi>that good ingenuous man in these dayes,
though he opposed them in polity, yet honoured them in mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:61021:30"/>
and certainty if he were now living, he would strongly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh
against their opposers in this respect. He cites</hi> Aristotle <hi>in
his 5. booke of</hi> Ethicks, <hi>and 3. cap.</hi> that many men in domesticall
things may be vertuous, and yet offend <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, yea, I am
perswaded <hi>(sayes he)</hi> that of those with whom we strive in this cause,
there are whose betters amongst men could hardly be found, if they
did not live amongst men, but in some wildernesse amongst themselves.
And the cause <hi>(sayes he)</hi> of their disposition so unframeable to So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
is, for that what they thinke privately to be convenient and just
with some shew of probability, the same they thinke themselves bound
to practise and uphold, notwithstanding any Law of man to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary:
and thus by following the Law of private reason, where the
Law of publike should take place, they breed disturbance. <hi>See here
the maine taxation of</hi> Puritans <hi>amongst their honest and wise
opposers (such as I allow</hi> Hooker <hi>to bee,) is this, that in things
indifferent, they will not recede from their owne consciences,
for any command whatsoever, in all necessary points of mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
there cannot be found better men. I cannot tell, I am left
to pronounce here with the Poet.</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>Crudelis Mater magis, an puer improbus ille?</l>
                  <l>Improbus ille puer, crudelis tu quoque mater.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I will only wish that neither the child would be so disrespect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
of his mothers judgement in indifferencies, nor the mother
so unpittifull of her childes weaknesse in scruples. <hi>Hooker</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
in his preface confesses, <hi>that</hi> Puritans <hi>at first were pityed only
in their errors, and not much withstood by any: for the great hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
zeale, and devotion which appeared to be in them, was in all
mens opinions, a pledge of their harmelesse meaning. The hardest</hi>
(sayes he) <hi>that men of sound understanding, conceived of them, was
but this: O quàm honestâ voluntate miseri erant!</hi> and for this
cause <hi>Luther</hi> made request to <hi>Fredericke</hi> of <hi>Saxony,</hi> that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
his dominion they might be favourably dealt with, and spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
for that, (their error exempted) they seemed otherwise
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:61021:30"/>
right good men. So then whilst their meaning is honest, and
whilst their honest meaning tends onely to make themselves
miserable, that is, objects of scorne, and punishment, favour
ought to be shewed. Tis true, <hi>Hooker</hi> after complaines, <hi>that this
favour produced ill effects amongst</hi> Puritans, <hi>who by meanes of such
mercifull tolleration gathered more strength then was safe for the
State:</hi> but under favour, this does not appeare so with me: In
<hi>France, Scotland,</hi> and those parts of <hi>Germany</hi> where <hi>Zealots</hi>
have had most liberty, and favour, I doe not see any effects so
evident thereof, as these: that <hi>Popery</hi> hath the sooner vanisht,
and enmity beene the better prevented. It seemes to me, that
<hi>England</hi> of all <hi>Protestant</hi> countries has least cause to boast of
her rigorous discipline towards <hi>Puritans,</hi> having never yet
been either quiet, or safe til this instant, and now scarce being able
to beleeve, that great worke of deliverance, which God hath
mercifully wrought for us. It cannot be denyed, but the yet
unsettled condition of these times hath been scandalous in mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
of <hi>Anabaptisticall</hi> sectaries, whose severall conventicles
cry, here is Christ, and here is Salvation: but what? Is this the
blame of the Churches indulgence to weake brethren in nice
scruples? surely no: for it is to be hoped, that when govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is againe settled, as favour shall bee used in matters of
indifferency, so the rod shall be resumed againe against all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate
offenders in matters of weight.</p>
            <p>And who does not see, that these swarmes of conventiclers
which now sequester themselves from us, are but the dregges
of the vilest and most ignorant rabble, whose doctrines can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
prevaile though they meet with no opposition, nor sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
when authority once lifts up its hands or shakes its Staffe
against them.</p>
            <p>The feeble Flyes of Sommer, which every shower, and
cloud almost disperses, are not more contemptible, than
these wretched throngs, whose workes not being of God,
no nor scarce of Rationall man, cannot prosper in such an
age of Knowledge, Learning, and Piety, as this is. Let us not
then for some Gnats, or frogges sakes ungratefully mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure
against Sommer, or undervalue all the sweet influences of
the Sun, and the softer gales of Heaven.</p>

               <hi>Puritans</hi> by some are parallelled to Iesuites, Iesuites are called
Popish <hi>Puritans,</hi> and <hi>Puritans, Protestant Iesuites;</hi> yet this is not
indeed disparageable to them: For doubtlesse fiery zeale and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
were not blameable in <hi>Iesuites,</hi> were not their very Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
false; as celerity and expedition in a Traveller is not in it selfe
faulty, but commendable, though the Traveller being in a wrong
path, it causes him to stray the further from his journies end.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord of</hi> Downe <hi>professes</hi> that the first thing which made him
distast the Religion of <hi>Puritans</hi> (besides their grosse hypocrisie) was
sedition: <hi>So grosse hypocrisie, it seemes, was the first. What is
grosse or visible hypocrisie to the Bishop, I know not, for I can
see no windowes or casements in mens breasts, neither do I think
him indued with</hi> Saint <hi>Peters</hi> propheticall spirit whereby to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
and search into the reines, and hearts of hypocrites; but let him
proceed. It is a plausible matter <hi>(saies he)</hi> with the people to heare men
in authority depraved, and to understand of any liberty and power ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining
to themselves, The profession also of extraordinary zeale,
and as it were contempt of the world workes with the multitude. When
they see men goe simply in the Streets, and bow downe their heads
like a Bull-rush, their inward parts burning with deceit, wringing
their neckes awry, shaking their heads as if they were in some present
griefe, lifting up the white of their eyes at the sight of some vanity,
giving great groanes, crying out against this sin and that sin in their
Superiours, under colour of long prayers, devouring widdowes, and
married wives houses; when the multitude heares and sees such men,
they are carried away with a great conceit of them, but if they should
judge of these men by their fruits, not by outward appearance, they
should find them to be very far from the true Religion. See here the
froth of a scurrilous libeller, whereby it is concluded that he that is of
severe life, and averse from the common vanit<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es of the time, is an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite:
If these descriptions of outward austerity I shall not only shew
what is an hypocrite, but point out also who is an hypocrit, our Saviour
himselfe will hardly scape this description; doubtles our Saviour, and
many of his devoutest followers did groane shake their heads, and
lift up their eyes at the sight of some publick <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, and vanities, and
did not spare to taxe the vices of Superiours, and to preach to, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish
the meaner sort of the people; yet who but an <hi>Annas</hi> or <hi>Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas</hi>
will infer from hence that therefore their inward parts burne
with deceit, and that their end is meerely to carry away the multitude;
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:61021:31"/>
such as judge only by outward appearance, and have not their sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
exercised to discerne betwixt good and evill? It is likely the
High Priests and Pharisees did thus blaspheme in those dayes, and
that the rather, because from their owne fayned sanctity, they
were the more apt to suspect the same in others: But what I must
wee needs follow them, or this Bishop in this? But to proceed with
this Bishop, Saint <hi>Iames (sayes he)</hi> gives us a full description of true
Religion.</p>
            <p>Wisdome from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle and
easie to bee entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and Hypocrisie. None of these properties will agree with
the Religion of <hi>Puritans.</hi> It is not pure for it allowes Vsury, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge,
Disobedience, Rebellion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is not peaceable, for
these men are the incendiaries of Christendome, It is not gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
nor easie to be intreated, for they are more austere than <hi>Cato,</hi>
and not to be moved by perswasion or command. It is not full of
mercy and good fruits, for they are all for sacrifice, nothing for
mercy; for the first Table, not the second; for faith, not charity; they
pull downe Churches, but build no hospitals. It is not without judging,
for they are known to be most rigid censurers. And hee is an Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite
which spies a mote in his brothers eyes, and not a beame in
his owne.</p>
            <p>Here is a confused proofe, that such <hi>Puritans</hi> are hypocrites,
but no proofe at all, that this man is such a <hi>Puritan.</hi> If my Lord
<hi>Say</hi> be such a <hi>Puritan,</hi> this denotes him an hypocrite, but this does
not prove that my Lord <hi>Say,</hi> or <hi>Brooke,</hi> or <hi>Dod,</hi> or <hi>Clever</hi> &amp;c.
or any the most famous <hi>Puritan</hi> living is guilty of Vsury, Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
Rebellion, pulling downe of Churches, setting the World
on fire, or of renouncing the second Table and all works of justice
and charity, or of censuring and condemning malignantly other
men: If these things were true of particular men, calumny were
needlesse: Accusation would better suppresse them. And sure it is
not out of favour that Law proceeds not, for malice has often en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough
shewed her teeth, and would have bitten if she could, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
would she now calumniate if she could accuse.</p>
            <p>The Bishop expects not to be beleeved; if he puzzell, and work
some into doubt, it is sufficient: but since bitter censuring, and
calumnious condemning of others is s<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

how doth the Bishop wipe this off from himselfe? Can Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:61021:32"/>
speake worse of any, than he doth of <hi>Puritans?</hi> Sure they
may well joyne with him upon this issue, that the greatest slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer
is the greatest hypocrite; and yet seeke no further for slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
than this very speech, wherein he so eagerly inveighs against
slander; but if individuals cannot be thus convinced by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,
how shall these signes and symptomes be applyed to whole
Sects, Religions, Kingdomes?</p>
            <p>The most ordinary badge of <hi>Puritans</hi> is their more religious
and conscionable conversation, than that which is seene in other
mens: and why this should make them odious or suspected of
hypocrisie amongst honest and charitable men, I could never yet
learne. A seeming religious consists in doing actions outwardly
good, and the goodnesse of those actions is apparent to man; but
the false hypocriticall end of them is onely discerned by God:
and therefore with what conscience can I condemne that good
which is visible, for that evill which is not visible? <hi>Say, Brooke,
Dod, Clever, &amp;c.</hi> are knowne to me; yet no otherwise but as men
singularly devote, and as all the Prophets, and Appostles would,
if they were now living: and shall I conclude because they seem
so, therefore they are not so? I am so far from this, that my owne
conscience bindes me to honour them, and that in those things,
wherein I have not the grace to follow them. I have been a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
inquirer into <hi>Puritans,</hi> and have exactly tryed them three
wayes. First, in themselves; and so I finde them zealous, at least
seeming so outwardly, and distinguisht principally from other
men by their remarkeable, and singular zeale to God and the
Truth: and this to me is no ground of uncharitable censure. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
in those, which in these times thinke and speake charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
of them; and they are so many in number, and of so good
quality, that indeed to the Popish and Episcopall faction, all the
kingdom almost seems <hi>Puritanical;</hi> but for this I cannot think the
worse of them. But thirdly, when I consider <hi>Puritans,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
them with their common notorious adversaries, then their
goodnesse seemes most evident to me, and if it were legibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graved
in the open wickednesse and scandall of their chiefe op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers.
Nothing but Truth, Hollinesse, and Goodnesse, seemes to
me to be the cause, that <hi>Papists</hi> do so implacably abominate them:
that our proud <hi>Hierarchists, Ambidexters,</hi> and <hi>Neuters</hi> in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
do so uncessantly pursue their subversion; that Court-flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers

and time-serving Projectors, and the ravenous Caterpil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
of the Realme, do so virulently prosecute them with defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
and contumelies; that Stage-poets, Minstrels, and the
jesting Buffoones of the age, make them the principall subject of
derision: Lastly, that all the shamelesse rout of drunkards, lechers,
and swearing ruffians; and the scume of the vulgar are so tickled
with their reproach, and abuse. Certainely, nothing but an unap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaseable
antipathy could be the cause of all this, and no testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of goodnesse can be more sure, un-erring, and unanswerable
than such antipathy.</p>
            <p>Amongst wicked men there may be particular hatred, but not a
generall antipathy: One wicked man hates not another as wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
but rather loves him therefore, or else the World did not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
a decorum in loving her owne, and hating strangers: As
there cannot be division in Satans kingdome; so there cannot be
communion or compatibility betwixt Christs and Satans Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.
But tis a miserable thing to see how far this word <hi>Puritan</hi>
in an Ethicall sense dilates itselfe. Heretofore it was <hi>Puritanicall,</hi>
to abstaine from small sins; but now tis so to abstaine from grosse
open sins. In the mouth of a Drunkard, he is a <hi>Puritan</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuseth
his cups; In the mouth of a Swearer, he which feares an
oath; In the mouth of a Libertine, he which make any scruple
of common sins; In the mouth of a rude Souldier, he which
wisheth the <hi>Scotch</hi> warre at an end without bloud. It is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
that such men thinke themselves tacitly checked and affron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the unblamable conversation of <hi>Puritans,</hi> Byshop <hi>Lake</hi>
that good and godly man moved at the declining state of his
time, is said to have expressed his regret thus: <hi>We feare,</hi> saith he,
<hi>a relapse into Popish error, and superstition; but my heart misgives
me worse than so: Vtter irreligion and Atheisme, me thinkes, begins
to prevaile strangly amongst us: we are not so likely to lose the light
of truth, as the heat of zeale; and what benefit is in Religion, where
the name of it is honoured, but the power of it is not at all seene? where
Gods Will is truely understood, but his commands are wholy slighted?
where men know like Christians, but live like Heathens? The soule
of Religion is hearty devotion, and that growes dayly more and more
ridiculous amongst us; and yet Religion without the soule of it, is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a curse than a blessing to us. No impiety is so hainous in an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant</hi>
Sodomite, <hi>as want of Piety is in a right instructed</hi> Israelite.
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:61021:33"/>
In this wise I have heard that good Prelate did complaine; and
this makes me thinke, that he had in his complaint some respect
to this word <hi>Puritan,</hi> then which, certainely the Devill hath not
a more fatall engine whereby to confound religion, and to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
all true zeale, goodnesse, and devotion. Thus farre it appeares
what a vast circumference this word <hi>Puritan</hi> has, and how by
its large acception it is used to cast durt in the face of all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
Theologicall, Civill, or Morall: so that scarce any moderate
man can avoid its imputation. And thus it does mischiefe to men,
not commonly noted for <hi>Puritans,</hi> but if a man be so noted, though
perhaps irregularly, then it is farther otherwise abused: for
all such a mans evill shall be charged upon his <hi>Puritanisme,</hi> and
all his good defaced for his <hi>Puritanisme.</hi> Such a man is condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
for murther, and adultery; and at his death gives strong
assurances of unfaigned repentance, and contrition of heart. He
was a <hi>Christian,</hi> a <hi>Protestant,</hi> a <hi>Minister,</hi> a <hi>Puritan;</hi> yet this
crime is recorded and blowne abroad, not for the shame of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
Protestants, Ministers,</hi> but of <hi>Puritans.</hi> And as for his attesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of deepe humiliation, how excellent soever, the honour of
them, if any be acknowledged, shall redound to the <hi>Christian,</hi> the
<hi>Protestant,</hi> the <hi>Minister,</hi> to any thing else except the <hi>Puritan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Howsoever in the first place it ought to be observed, that an
uncleane streame does not alwayes receive it's uncleannesse from
the filth of the Fountaine, but in the second place a pure streame
necessarily infers a pure Source. Tis true, Trees are knowne
by their fruites, and so are men generally by their workes; but
this similitude holdes not in all men, at all times: for good men
sometimes commit soule sinnes, and bad men performe laudable
services. <hi>David</hi> defiles <hi>Vriahs</hi> wife, and to conceale it from the
world, makes drunke and murders <hi>Vriah;</hi> and together with
him casts away the lives of many other faithfull Souldiers: yet
nothing moved at this his owne mis-doing, at the same time he
sentences to death a Subject of his for damnifying a neighbour,
to the value of a poore lamb: what might <hi>Joab,</hi> and the other pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
<hi>Ministers</hi> of these his foule deeds, censure all this while of this
his externally professed sanctity, and purity, and strictnes in point
of justice to other men; or of his so great indignation against pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

offenders? what might they judge of the root, from whence
these fruits sprung? did they conclude these fruits, good? or did
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:61021:33"/>
they conceive that such fruits might grow upon a good stocke?
It's strange, that he which would be so rigid to a petty fellon,
should himselfe find no remorse at his owne murther and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
in spoyling so gallant a Commander, of his wife, of his
sobriety, of his life, and to continue so long a time without regard
either what himselfe had done, or what <hi>Vriah</hi> had suffered. But
it's well, <hi>David</hi> lived in those times when the name of <hi>Purita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme</hi>
was not invented to blast all goodnesse: had he lived a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us, he had been accounted a <hi>Puritan,</hi> and being a <hi>Puritan,</hi>
God might have forgiven him, but the world never would: but it
seemes the world was not then poysoned with the same base
word, though I beleeve under some other nicke-name goodnesse
was alwaies odious: for we read, that for that very sin of <hi>David,</hi>
Gods name was evill spoken of amongst the wicked. So <hi>Solomon</hi>
the Sonne of seduced <hi>Bathsheba,</hi> if we censure him by many of his
actions, perhaps <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> and <hi>Ahab</hi> that made <hi>Israel</hi> to sinne,
were not personally addicted to so much excesse of bodily lust,
and pollution, nay perhaps many heathens and <hi>Turkes</hi> have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested
his enormous lubricities.</p>
            <p>I speak not this to countenance sin, but to discountenance rash
censures of sinners, wishing all that thinke themselves fraile and
mortall, to turne their eyes inwards, and to lay their hands upon
their owne mouths, forbearing to censure all sins, but most espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the most latent and obscure of all sins, hypocrisie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Solyman</hi> the magnificent is held the honestest of all the Princes
which raigned in his time, not excepting Christian Princes, nay
not excepting the great Father of them all, the Apostolicke man
of <hi>Rome:</hi> yet this is no shame to Christianity, but to Christians ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
nay I wish it might be accounted rather a rebuke, than a
shame; rather a rebuke to humble them, than a shame to confute
them. For <hi>Christ</hi> tels us that many times the first are last, and last
first, God sees not as man sees, and yet he that will judge upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ought to see as God sees, and not as man. So much of the exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
infamy of this word <hi>Puritan,</hi> now of its intensive malignan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy:
but little more needs to be spoken hereof, for he which tels
you who is a <hi>Puritan,</hi> for the most part tels what is a <hi>Puritan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Papist</hi> we see hates one kind of <hi>Puritans,</hi> the <hi>Hierarchist</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
the Court <hi>Sycophant</hi> another, the sensuall Libertin another;
yet all hate a <hi>Puritan,</hi> and under the same name many times hate
the same thing. He which is an enemy to our Religion which
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:61021:34"/>
is the truth, hates the <hi>Puritan</hi> as an enemy to Truth; he which
is an enemy to Piety, Policy, Morality, charges the <hi>Puritan</hi> of
being the same: wherefore whatsoever is hated by the perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and disaffected in Religion, Piety, Policy, Morality, is a <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan,</hi>
and whosoever is a <hi>Puritan,</hi> is censured, hated, and slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
as a man perverted and disaffected in Religion, Piety, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy,
and Morality.</p>
            <p>This sufficiently appeares by the common slanders of all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in these dayes, and particularly by the Byshop of <hi>Downe,</hi> for
as he justifies <hi>Jesuites, Anabaptists,</hi> and the Powder-Traiters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Puritans;</hi> so he describes, and proscribes whole Religions,
Sects, and Kingdomes for <hi>Puritans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the yeare of grace 1588, when the <hi>Spanish Armado</hi> had mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried,
notwithstanding that his holines of <hi>Rome</hi> had so perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptorily
christned it, and as it were conjured for it, One of that
Religion was strangely distempered at it, and his speech was
as 'tis reported, God himselfe was turned <hi>Lutheran:</hi> By which,
for certaine, he meant Hereticall. 'Tis much therefore that my
Lord of <hi>Downe,</hi> now that Episcopacy is so foyled in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
has not raged in the like manner, and charged God of turning
<hi>Puritan:</hi> but surely, if he has spared God, he has not spared any
thing else that is good; and if he has spared to call God <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi>
he has not spared to call <hi>Puritan</hi> Devill: but to conclude,
if the confused misapplication of this foule word <hi>Puritan</hi> be not
reformed in <hi>England,</hi> and that with speed, we can expect no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but a suddaine universall downefall of all goodnesse what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever.
<hi>AElius Adrianus</hi> the Emperour, about an hundred
yeares after our Saviour, having beene certified by <hi>Serenius Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianus,
Proconsul</hi> of <hi>Asia,</hi> that the Christians in those partes
were illegally oppressed by the malice of unjust <hi>Sycophants,</hi>
sends this his Imperiall edict to the next successor <hi>Minutius
Fundanus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the Provincials can prove ought against the Christians, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
they charge them, and can at the barre of justice make good the
same, let them proceed in a juditiall course: but let them not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poach,
the Christians meerely for the name, by clamouring, and ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
scandals against them: For it is expedient, if any be disposed
to accuse, that the accusation bee throughly knowne, and judicially
tryed you; therefore if any accuse the Christians that they trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:61021:34"/>
the Lawes, see that you judge and punist according to the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the offence, but if any upon spite or malice by way of calumny

               </gap>st them, see you chastise such for their malice, and
repay them with condigne punishment. I began with a <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quesso,</hi>
I end with an <hi>Emperour,</hi> both read the same Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
both teach us a difference betwixt privy mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
calumny and open judiciall accusing,
or impleading; God sends us to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
