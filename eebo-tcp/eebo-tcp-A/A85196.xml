            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE GENERAL COVNCIL OF OFFICERS.</head>
            <head type="sub">The Repreſentation of divers Citizens of LONDON, and others Well-affected to the Peace and Tranquility of the Common-wealth.</head>
            <p>AS Wee doubt not but the words of your friends will find acceptance, ſo our Lives, Liberties, and All that is dear and near to us, being imbarqued in the ſame Bottom with yours, we cannot be ſo inſenſible, as not to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the ſtorm impending, nor ſo careleſs of our own Concernments, as not to lay down our Obſervations before you.</p>
            <p>When by the interrruption of Government you reduced theſe Nations unto that condition they are now in, Though you could not be ignorant, that what you did, would be very grateful to the Common Enemy; who alwaies had the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in an odious memory for the great things God hath done by them, and the little hopes they have of ever prevailing againſt their induſtry and prudence; yet we cannot in the leaſt ſuſpect, that you could (in that action) have before your eys the contentment of your malitious and implacable enemies; But rather a cordial and ſincere intention of ſettling thoſe things ſo long contended for, by a ſpeedier hand then that of the Parliament, (of whoſe grave, ſlow, pace you were impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent) exſpecting thereby to give full ſatisfaction to all your friends and adherents, to the uniting of them the firmlier to you. Other ends then theſe, we hope could not enter into the hearts of many of you; And therefore, taking this to be the caſe, and knowing that Experience is the beſt Teacher, We deſire leave to obſerve how little the ſucceſſe hath hitherto anſwered your Ends.</p>
            <p>It is viſible to all that have any occaſion to converſe with your enemies, that they are exceedingly rejoyced at your late tranſactions, not doubting, but by the diviſion of your friends, to have an opportunity to deſtroy both you and them.</p>
            <p>And it is alſo as viſible, that your friends are disſatisfied, not being able to go along with you in your preſent underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings; And that, not only as they are without any warrantable Call made out to them, but alſo, as they are againſt that acknowledged principle of all juſt Powers, being (under God) originally in the People, and derived from them; Beyond which, we cannot be free to act, or own any thing for Legal or unuſurped; Knowing, that what is ſettled by a party, will alwaies be unſtable, and ſubject to the wills, and alterations of that party; eſpecially, when it hath the Sword, as the reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Parliament, though done with the greateſt acknowledgment of duty imaginable, is now made uſe of by many (though weakly) for the juſtification of the late interruption.</p>
            <p>We cannot alſo, but in taking notice that you having already ſpent near half as much time upon the Government alone, without bringing any thing to maturity, as the Parliament did in that and all other affairs, hope you are (to the vindication of them) convinced of the greatneſs and difficulty of the work.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, we may obſerve, that if by rooting up foundations you muſt neceſſarily give the common Enemie a great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, you ought to be aſſured of a party able to oppoſe him; And that if all your friends united, be a body ſmall enough, for that end, you cannot rationally conceive that leſs then half will be ſufficient to maintaine your quarrell, now your Enemies are ſtrengthened with the addition of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> who without doubt are at this preſent vigorouſly at work.</p>
            <p>We might ſay much more upon this ſubject, but thinking it needleſs to perſons who will be equally concerned with us in any common Calamity, we ſhall not trouble you further then upon the whole to deſire (which we do with hearts full of ſorrow and feare) That ſince (as we do aſſert) the reſtleſs adverſary is not likely to be idle; That he cannot in all probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be oppoſed but by the union of your Friends; That there can be no union without reſtoring foundations; That the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of Government cannot be continued without weakening your hands to the ſtrengthening thoſe of your Enemies) That as the only way left us for our preſervation you would ſpeedily (leaſt otherwiſe it be too late) withdraw the force from the Parliament Houſe door, leaving the Members lately interrupted to return to the diſcharge of their truſt in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leing the deſtracted affairs of this Commonwealth, and making proviſion for future Parliaments; In doing which you will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unite the hearts of your Friends, oblige them to a Cordiall Conjunction with you in the oppoſition of the common ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and cauſe them once more to rejoyce in having the leſs reaſon to be afraid of what our adverſaries can do unto us.</p>
            <trailer>This Repreſentation was delivered by divers Citizens of <hi>London</hi> to the Lord <hi>Fleetwood</hi> 
               <date>the 6th, of this preſent <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> 1659.</date> to be by him Communicated to the Generall Council of Officers, as the only expedient to deliver this Nation from (otherwiſe) inevitable ruin and deſtruction.</trailer>
