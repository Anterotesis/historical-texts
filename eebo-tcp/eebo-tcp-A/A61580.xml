            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was the early <hi>felicitie</hi> of <hi>Moses,</hi> when exposed in an <hi>Ark</hi> of <hi>Nilotick papyre,</hi> to be adopted into the <hi>favour</hi> of so great a personage as the <hi>Daughter</hi> of <hi>Pharaoh:</hi> Such another <hi>Ark</hi> is this vindication of the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of that <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>excellent Person</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to the world in; and the greatest am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of the Author of it, is, to have it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into your <hi>Patronage</hi> and <hi>Protection.</hi>

But although the contexture and frame of this Treatise be far below the excellency and worth of the subject (as you know the <hi>Ark</hi> in which <hi>Moses</hi> was put, <hi>was of bulrushes daubed with slime and pitch)</hi> yet when You please to cast your eye on the matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it, you will not think it beneath your <hi>Favour,</hi> and unworthy your <hi>Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> For if <hi>Truth</hi> be the greatest <hi>Present</hi> which God could bestow, or man receive (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that of <hi>Plurarch)</hi>

               <hi>Truths</hi> deserve our most ready acceptance, which are in themselves of greatest impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and have the greatest evidence that they come from God. And although I have had the happiness of so near relation to You, &amp; acquaintance with You, as to know how little You need such discourses which tend to settle the <hi>Foundations</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> which you have raised so happy a <hi>Superstructure</hi> upon; yet withal I consider what particular <hi>Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> the souls of all good men bear to such Designs, whose end is to assert and vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Excellency</hi> of <hi>Religion.</hi> For those who are enriched themselves with the inestimable Treasure of true Goodness and
<pb facs="tcp:53276:3"/>
Piety are far from that envious temper, to think nothing valuable but what they are the sole Possessors of; but such are the most satisfied themselves, when they see others not only admire but enjoy what they have the highest estimation of. Were all who make a shew of Religion in the World really such as they pretend to be, discourses of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture vvould be no more seasonable then the commendations of a great <hi>Beauty</hi> to one vvho is already a passionate admirer of it; but on the contrary vve see how common it is for men first to throw <hi>dirt</hi> in the <hi>face</hi> of Religion, and then perswade themselves it is its natural <hi>Complexion;</hi> they represent it to themselves in a <hi>shape</hi> least pleasing to them, and then bring that as a <hi>Plea</hi> why they give it no better entertainment.</p>
            <p>It may justly seem strange, that true <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> which contains nothing in it but what is truly <hi>Noble</hi> and <hi>Generous,</hi> most <hi>rational</hi> and <hi>pleasing</hi> to the <hi>spirits</hi> of all <hi>good men,</hi> should yet suffer so much in its esteem in the world, through those strange and uncouth <hi>vizards</hi> it is represented under. Some accouting the life and practice of it, as it speaks <hi>subduing</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:53276:4"/>
our <hi>wills</hi> to the <hi>will</hi> of <hi>God</hi> (which is the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of all Religion) a thing too low and mean for their rank and condition in the World, while others pretend a quarrel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the principles of it as unsatisfactory to <hi>Humane reason.</hi> Thus <hi>Religion</hi> suffers with the <hi>Author</hi> of it between two <hi>Thieves,</hi> and it is hard to define which is more injurious to it, that which questions the <hi>Principles,</hi> or that which despiseth the <hi>Practice</hi> of it. And nothing certainly will more incline men to believe that we live in an <hi>Age</hi> of <hi>Prodigies,</hi> then that there should be any such in the Christian World who should account it a piece of <hi>Gentility</hi> to despise <hi>Religion,</hi> and a piece of <hi>Reason</hi> to be <hi>Atheists.</hi> For if there be any such things in the World as a true <hi>height</hi> and <hi>magnanimity</hi> of <hi>spirit,</hi> if there be any <hi>so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid reason</hi> and depth of <hi>judgement,</hi> they are not only consistent with, but only attainable by a true <hi>generous spirit</hi> of <hi>Religion.</hi> But if we look at that which the loose and profane World is apt to account the greatest <hi>gallantry,</hi> we shall find it made up of such pitiful <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients,</hi> which any skilful &amp; rational mind will be ashamed to plead for, much less to

mention them in competition with true <hi>goodness</hi> and unfeigned <hi>piety.</hi> For how easie is it to observe such who would be accounted the most <hi>high</hi> and <hi>gallant spirits,</hi> to <hi>quarry</hi> on such mean <hi>preys</hi> which only tend to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie their brutish appetites, or <hi>flesh</hi> revenge with the <hi>blood</hi> of such who have stood in the way of that ayery title, <hi>Honour!</hi> Or else they are so little apprehensive of the in ward worth and excellency of humane nature, that they seem to envy the <hi>gallantry</hi> of <hi>Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocks,</hi> and strive to outvy them in the <hi>gayety</hi> of their <hi>Plumes;</hi> such vvho are, as <hi>seneca</hi> saith, <hi>ad similitudinem parietum extrinsecùs cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti,</hi> vvho imitate the <hi>walls</hi> of their <hi>houses</hi> in the <hi>fairness</hi> of the <hi>outsides,</hi> but matter not vvhat <hi>rubbish</hi> there lies <hi>within.</hi> The utmost of their ambition is to attain <hi>enervatam feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citatem quâ permadescunt animi,</hi> such a <hi>felicity</hi> as <hi>evigorates</hi> the soul by too long <hi>steeping,</hi> it being the nature of all terrestrial pleasures that they do <gap reason="foreign">

Is it not more truly <hi>honourable</hi> and <hi>glorious</hi> to serve that God who commands the World, then to be a slave to those <hi>passions</hi> and <hi>lusts</hi> which put men upon continual hard ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and <hi>torment</hi> them for it when they have done it? Were there nothing else to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend <hi>Religion</hi> to the minds of men, besides
<pb facs="tcp:53276:5"/>
that tranquillity and calmness of spirit, that serene and peaceable temper which follows a <hi>good conscience</hi> whereever it dwells, it were enough to make men <hi>welcom</hi> that <hi>guest</hi> which brings such good <hi>entertainment</hi> with it. Whereas the <hi>amazements, horrours,</hi> and <hi>anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties</hi> of <hi>mind,</hi> which at one time or other <hi>haunt</hi> such who <hi>prostitute</hi> their <hi>Consciences</hi> to a violation of the <hi>Lawes</hi> of God, and the rules of <hi>rectified reason,</hi> may be enough to perswade any rational person, that <hi>impiety</hi> is the greatest <hi>folly,</hi> and irreligion, <hi>madness.</hi> It cannot be then but matter of great pity to consider that any persons whose birth and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation hath raised them above the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people of the World, should be so far their own enemies, as to observe the <hi>Fashion</hi> more then the rules of <hi>Religion,</hi> and to study <hi>complements</hi> more then themselves, and read <hi>Romances</hi> more then the <hi>sacred Scriptures, which alone are able to make them wise to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Sir,</hi> I need not mention these things to <hi>You,</hi> unless it be to let <hi>You</hi> see the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of your <hi>choice,</hi> in preferring true <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi> and <hi>Piety</hi> above the <hi>Ceremony</hi> and <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur</hi>

of <hi>Religion</hi> (which is easily mistaken, when men look upon the <hi>face</hi> of it in any other glass then that of the Scriptures) but likewise for maintaining a powerful sense of <hi>Religion</hi> in the souls of men, and a due valuation of it, whatever its esteem or entertainment be in the World. For though the true genuine spirit of <hi>Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> (which is known by the <hi>purity</hi> and <hi>peaceableness</hi> of it) should grow never so much out of credit with the World, yet none who heartily believe the <hi>Scriptures</hi> to be the <hi>Word of God,</hi> and that the matters revealed therein are infallibly <hi>true,</hi> will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have the less estimation of it.

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is neither to satisfie the importunity of friends, nor to prevent false copies (which and such like excuses I know are expected in usual Prefaces) that I have adventured abroad this following Treatise: but it is out of a just resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the affronts and indignities which have been cast on Religion; by such, who account it a matter of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to disbelieve the Scriptures, and a piece of wit to dispute themselves out of the possibility of being happy in another world: When yet the more acute and subtile their arguments are, the greater their strength is against themselves, it being impossible there should be so much wit and subtilty in the souls of men, were they not of a more excellent nature then they imagine them to be. And how contradictious is it for such persons to be am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious of being cryed up for wit and reason, whose design
<pb facs="tcp:53276:9"/>
is to degrade the rational soul so far below her self, as to make her become like the beasts that perish! If now the weight and consequence of the subject, and the too great seasonableness of it (if the common fame of the large spread of Atheism among us be true) be not sufficient Apology for the publishing this Book, I am resolved rather to undergo thy censure, tben be beholding to any other. The intendment therefore of this Preface is only to give a brief account of the scope, design, and method of the following Books, although the view of the Contents of the Chapters might sufficiently acquains thee with it. How far I have been either from tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seribing, or a design to excusse out of the hands of their admirers, the several writings on the behalf of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in general, or Christianity in particular (especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Mornay, Gro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Had I not thought something might be said, if not more fully and rationally, yet more suitably to the present temper of this Age then what is already written by them, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>theists imploy against Religion; the most papular pretences of the Atheists of our Age, have been the irreconcileable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the account of Times in Scripture, with that of the learned and ancient Heathen Nations; the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistency of the belief of the Scriptures with the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of reason; and the account which may be given of the Origine of things from principles of Philosophy without the Scriptures; These three therefore I have particularly set my self against, and directed against each of them a several Book. In the first I have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested
<pb facs="tcp:53276:9"/>
that there is no ground of credibility in the account of ancient times given by any Heathen Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions different from the Scriptures, which I have with so much care and diligence enquired into, that from thence we may hope to hear no more of men before <hi>Adam</hi> to salve the Authority of the Scriptures by, which yet was intended only as a design to undermine them; but I have not thought the frivolous pretences of the Author of that Hypothesis worth particular men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning, supposing it sufficient to give a clear account of things without particular citation of Authors, where it was not of great concernment for understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the thing its self. In the second Book I have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken to give a rational account of the grounds, why we are to believe those several persons, who in several ages were imployed to reveal the mind of God to the world, and with greater particularity then hath yet been used, I have insisted on the persons of <hi>Moses,</hi> and the Prophets, our Saviour and his Apostles, and in every of them manifested the rational evidences on which they were to be believed, not only by the men of their own Age, but by those of succeeding Generations. In the third Book I have insisted on the matters them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves which are either supposed by or revealed in the Scriptures; and have therein not only manifested the certainty of the foundations of all Religion which lye in the Being of God and Immortality of the soul, but the undoubted truth of those particular accounts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Origine of the Universe, of Evil, and of Nations, which were most lyable to the Atheists ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, and have therein considered all the pretences of Philosophy ancient or modern, which have seemed to contradict any of them; to which <hi>(mant ssae loco)</hi> I have added the evidence of Scripture History in the
<pb facs="tcp:53276:10"/>
remainders of it in Heathen Mythology, and concluded all with a discourse of the excellency of the Scriptures. Thus having given a brief view of the design and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of the whole, I submit it to every free and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced judgement. All the favour then I shall request of thee, is, to read seriously, and judge impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially; and then I doubt not but thou wilt see as much reason for Religion as I do.</p>

The question stated where the true History of ancient times to be found, in Heathen Histories, or only in Scripture? The want of credibility in Heathen Histories asserted and proved by the general defect for want of timely records among Heathen Nations; the reason of it shewed from the first Plantations of the World.

               <p>In order to the proving the truth of Scripture-history, several Hypotheses laid down. The first concerns the reasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of preserving the ancient History of the world in some certain Records, from the importance of the things, and the inconveniencies of meer tradition or constant Revelation<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The second concerns the certainty that the Records under <hi>Moses</hi> his name, were undoubtedly his. The certainty of a matter of fact enquired into in general, and proved as to this particular by universal consent, and settling a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth upon his Laws. The impossibility of an Imposture as to the writings of <hi>Moses</hi> demonstrated. The plea's to the contrary largely answered. <hi>page 107</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The third Hypothesis concerns the certainty of the matter of <hi>Moses</hi> his history; that gradually proved: First, <hi>Moses</hi> his knowledge cleared, by his education, and experience, and certain information. His education in the wisdom of <hi>Aegypt;</hi> what that was. The old <hi>Aegyptian</hi> learning en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired into, the conveniences for it of the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Priests. <hi>Moses</hi> reckoned among them for his knowledge. The Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical, Natural, Divine, and Moral learning of <hi>Aegypt:</hi> their Political wisdom most considerable. The advantage of <hi>Moses</hi> above the Greek Philosophers, as to wisdom and reason. <hi>Moses</hi> himself an eye witness of most of his history: the certain uninterrupted tradition of the other part among the fews, manifested by rational evidence. <hi>p. 119</hi>

Things may be true which depend not on evidence of the things. What that is, and on what it depends. The uncertainty of natural knowledge. The existence of God, the foundation of all certainty. The cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of matters of faith proved from the same principle. Our knowledge of any thing supposeth something incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible. The certainty of faith as great as that of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; the grounds of it stronger. The consistency of rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal evidence with faith. Yet objects of faith exceed reason; the absurdities following the contrary opinion. The uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of that which is called reason.

Why <hi>John Baptist</hi> wrought no miracles. Christs miracles necessary for the everthrow of the Devils Kingdom. Of the Daemoniaeks and Lunaticks in the Gospel, and in the Primitive Church. The power of the name of Christ over them largely proved by several Testimonies. The evidence thence of a Divine power in Christ. Of counterfeit dispossessions. Of miracles wrought among Infidels. Of the future state of the Church. The necessity of the miracles of Christ, as to the propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christian Religion: that proved from the condition of the publishers, and the success of the Doctrine. The Apostles knew the hazard of their imployment, before they entred on it. The boldness and resolution of the Apostles not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding this, compared with heathen Philosophers. No motive could carry the Apostles through their imployment, but the truth of their Doctrine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not seeking the honour, profit or pleasure of the world.

               </p>
               <p>Concerning matters of pure divine revelation in Scripture: the terms of Salvation only contained therein. The ground of the disesteem of the Scriptures is tacite unbelief. The Excellency of the Scriptures manifested as to the matters which God hath revealed therein. The excellency of the discoveries of Gods nature which are in Scripture. Of the goodness and love of God in Christ. The suitableness of those discoveryes of God to our natural notions of a Deity. The necessity of Gods making known himself to us in order to the regulating our conceptions of him. The Scriptures give the fullest account of the state of mens souls, and the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which are in them. The only way of pleasing God dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in Scriptures. The Scriptures contain matters of
<pb facs="tcp:53276:20"/>
greatest mysteriousness, and most universal satisfaction to mens minds. The excellency of the manner wherein things are revealed in Scriptures, in regard of clearness, authority, purity, uniformity, and perswasiveness. The excellency of the Scriptures as a rule of life. The nature of the duties of Religion and the reasonableness of them. The greatness of the encouragements to Religion contained in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures. The great excellency of the Scriptures, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining in them the Covenant of Grace in order to mans Salvation. <hi>pag. 599</hi>

Of Philosophical Atheism, and the grounds of it. The History of Antiquity very obscure.

The want of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility in Heathen Histories asserted and proved by the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral defect for want of timely records among Heathen Nations; the reason of it shewed from the first Plantations of the World.

Nay <hi>thirdly,</hi> whence came the <hi>study of Astronomy</hi> to be so lamentably <hi>defective</hi> in those ancient times, if they had such certain <hi>observations</hi> of the <hi>heavenly bodies</hi> gathered by so much experience of the persons who lived before the Flood? <hi>Fourthly,</hi> how comes <hi>Iosephus</hi> himself to neglect this <hi>remarkable testimony</hi> of the <hi>truth</hi> of <hi>Scripture-history</hi> in his <hi>books</hi> against <hi>Appion,</hi> if he had thought it were such as might be relyed on? <hi>Fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> how comes <hi>Iosephus</hi> so carelesly to set down the place in <hi>Syria</hi> where these pillars stood, that inquisitive persons might have satisfied themselves with the sight of the pillar at least, and what kind of <hi>Characters</hi> those <hi>observations</hi> were preserved in?

Manetho</hi> we have already made appear to have lived in the time of <hi>Ptolomaeus Philadelphus,</hi> and that, saith <hi>Vos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius,</hi> after the death of <hi>Soter.</hi> It is evident from what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of him in <hi>Eusebius</hi> his <hi>Chronica,</hi> that he not only <hi>flourished</hi> in the time of <hi>Philadelphus,</hi> but writ his <hi>history</hi> at the special <hi>command</hi> of <hi>Philadelphus,</hi> as manifestly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the <hi>remaining Epistle</hi> of <hi>Manetho</hi> to him, still ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in <hi>Eusebius.</hi> This command of <hi>Philadelphus</hi> might very <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Chr. Gr. p.</hi> 6</note> probably be occasioned upon the <hi>view</hi> of that <hi>account,</hi> which
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:53276:46"/>
the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> being then translated into <hi>Greek,</hi> did give of the <hi>world,</hi> and the <hi>propagation</hi> of <hi>mankind;</hi> upon which, we cannot <hi>imagine</hi> but so <hi>inquisitive</hi> a person as <hi>Philadelphus</hi> was, would be very earnest to have his <hi>curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity</hi> satisfied, as to what the <hi>Aegyptian Priests</hi> (who had boasted so much of antiquity) could produce to <hi>confront</hi> with the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> Whereupon the task was underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by this <hi>Manetho, High-Priest of Heliopolis,</hi> whereby those things which the <hi>Aegyptian Priests</hi> had to that time kept secret in their <hi>Cloysters,</hi> were now <hi>divulged</hi> and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed</hi> to the <hi>judgement</hi> of the <hi>learned world;</hi> but what <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction</hi> they were able to give <hi>inquisitive</hi> minds, as to the main <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>But all this will not perswade <hi>Kircher;</hi> for, whatever <hi>Scaliger,</hi> nay, what <hi>Manetho</hi> himself says to the coutrary, he, with the confidence and learning of a <hi>Iesuite,</hi> affirms, that this <hi>Manetho</hi> is elder then <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>great.</hi> For these are his words, <hi>Frequens apud priscos historicos Dynae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiarum Aegyptiacarum fit mentio, quarum tamen alium</hi>

All the business is, they quote him as an <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Writer;</hi> but what then? The Author of the Book <hi>Iuchasim</hi> was <hi>Abraham Zacuth</hi> a <hi>Iew</hi> of <hi>Salamancha,</hi> who writ in the year of our Lord 1502. and this book was first
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:53276:47"/>
printed at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> 1556. Might not this man then well mention <hi>Manetho</hi> as an ancient Writer, if he flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished above 1600 years before him, in the time of <hi>Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maeus Philadelphus?</hi> And what if some <hi>Arabick</hi> Writers mention him? are they of so great antiquity and credit themselves, that it is an evidence <hi>Manetho</hi> lived in <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> time to be <hi>praised</hi> by them?

But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>Kircher.</hi> It is freely granted that <hi>Iosephus,</hi> an Author of <hi>credit</hi> and <hi>age,</hi> sufficient to give his opinion in this case, doth very frequently cite <hi>Manetho</hi> in his <hi>Aegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptian History;</hi> particularly in his learned <hi>Books</hi> against <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion;</hi> but where he doth give the least intimation of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netho</hi> being elder then <hi>Alexander,</hi> I am yet to seek. But <hi>Kircher</hi> will not yet leave the matter so, but undertakes to give an account of the mistake; which is, that there were two <hi>Manetho's</hi> besides, and both <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by <hi>Suidas;</hi> one a <hi>Mendesian,</hi> who writ of the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration</hi> of the <hi>Aegyptian</hi>

                  </gap>, a kind of <hi>perfume</hi> used by the <hi>Aegyptian Priests.</hi> The other a <hi>Diospolitan,</hi> who writ some <hi>Physiological and Astronomical</hi> Treatises, whose works he hears are preserved in the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Florenee</hi> his <hi>Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie;</hi> and this was he (saith he) who lived in the <hi>times</hi> of <hi>Augustus,</hi> whom many by the <hi>aequivocation</hi> of the <hi>name</hi> have <hi>confounded</hi> with the ancient <hi>Writer</hi> of the <hi>Aegyptian Dynastyes.</hi> Is it possible so learned a <hi>Iesuite</hi> should dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover so little judgement in so few words? For <hi>first,</hi> who ever <hi>asserted</hi> the Writer of the <hi>Dynastyes</hi> to have lived in the time of <hi>Augustus?</hi> Yet <hi>secondly,</hi> if that <hi>Manetho</hi> whom <hi>Suidas</hi> there speaks of, lived in <hi>Augustus</hi> his time, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Kircher,</hi> then it must necessarily follow, that the <hi>Compiler</hi> of the <hi>Dynastyes</hi> did: for it is evident to any one that looks into <hi>Suidas,</hi> that he there speaks of the same <hi>Manetho;</hi> for these are his words: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c. Can any thing be more plain then that he here speaks of <hi>Manetho Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bennyta,</hi> who was the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Dynastyes,</hi> though he might write other things besides, of which <hi>Suidas</hi> there

speaks? But <hi>Kircher</hi> very wisely, in translating <hi>Suidas</hi> his words, leaves out <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, which decides the <hi>contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie,</hi> and makes it clear that he speaks of the same <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netho,</hi> of whom we have been discoursing.

For,</hi> saith he, <hi>at first Poetry was only in request, afterwards in imitation of that,</hi> Cadmus, Pherecydes <hi>and</hi> Hecataeus <hi>writ their histories, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving all other laws of Poetry, but only the measures of it; but by degrees writers began to take greater liberty, and so</hi>

And to this purpose <hi>Scaliger</hi> observes that some of their first <hi>Kings</hi> are reckoned <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Not. in Gr. Euseb. p.</hi> 406.</note> before the <hi>flood,</hi> which saith he, is denyed by <hi>Georgius Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus</hi>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:53276:61"/>
without any shew of reason: Thus far then we may admit of the <hi>Chaldeans Dynastyes</hi> as to some part of the tradition, but rejecting their names and computations as fabulous. The other way of explaining these <hi>Dynastyes,</hi> is by the several wayes of computation among them; For the learned <hi>Monks, Panodorus,</hi> and <hi>Anianus,</hi> understand those vast sums, not of <hi>years,</hi> but <hi>dayes,</hi> and so make a <hi>Saros</hi> to contain 120. months of 30. dayes a piece, which saith <hi>Scaliger,</hi> make ten <hi>Chaldee years,</hi> and a <hi>Nirus</hi> 20. <hi>equal months,</hi> and <hi>a Sosos two:</hi> according to which computation, the 100 <hi>Sari</hi> make but 1200. <hi>years.</hi> But this computation of theirs is rejected by <hi>Georgius Syncellus,</hi> because he sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth <hi>Eusebius</hi> so well versed in these things, that he would never have set them down for <hi>years,</hi> if the <hi>Chaldaeans</hi> had not understood them so, and therefore he would not trouble himself in reducing <hi>Fables</hi> to true <hi>History,</hi> as he expresseth it, whose words are at large produced by <hi>Scaliger</hi> in the fore-cited place; and it will appear more necessary to reject those <hi>Chaldaean computations,</hi> if we take the <hi>sums</hi> of their years in the sense which <hi>Salmasius</hi> gives of them in the preface to his book <hi>De annis Climactericis</hi> (from whom <hi>Pyrerius</hi> the Author of the <hi>Praeadamites)</hi> hath bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed most of his arguments as to these things.)

               <p>THe next thing to evidence the <hi>uncertainty</hi> of the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Chronology,</hi> is, <hi>the want of certain parapegmata, or</hi>

                  <hi>some fixed periods of time, according to which the account of times must be made.</hi> For if there be no certain <hi>Epocha's</hi> by which to reckon the <hi>succession</hi> of <hi>ages,</hi> the <hi>distance</hi> of <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valls,</hi> and all <hi>intervening accidents,</hi> we must of necessity <hi>fluctuate</hi> in continual uncertainties, and have no sure foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to bottom any account of antient times upon. The great reason of this defect, is the little care which those who lived in the <hi>eldest times</hi> had to preserve the <hi>memory</hi> of any <hi>antient tradition</hi> among themselves, or to convey it to posterity in such a way as might be least lyable to imposture. Of all kinds of <hi>Learning, Chronology</hi> was the most rude in eldest times; and yet that is well called by <hi>Scaliger, the life and soul of History,</hi> without which, <hi>History</hi> is but a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused</hi>

All the difficulty is in what year of sacred history the <hi>Olympi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ads</hi> began, which <hi>Scaliger</hi> thus finds out. <hi>Censorinus</hi> writes (in the year of Christ 238. which was of the <hi>Iulian period</hi>

Not that I think those Nations had lain in a perpetual sleep till the <hi>Romans</hi> waked them into some kind of civility, but that they had no certain way of conveying down the transactions of their own and former times to the view of posterity. On which account we may justly reject all those pretended successions of Kings h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For although <hi>Porcius Cato</hi>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:53276:69"/>
have in <hi>Dionysius</hi> the honour of finding out the first <hi>Pali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi> of the City of <hi>Rome</hi> (which was the Feast observed to the honour of the <hi>God Pales,</hi> in the time of which, the foundations of <hi>Rome</hi> were laid) yet there appears no great certainty in his undertaking; for therein he was after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted by the <hi>learned Roman Varro. Dionysius</hi> tells us that <hi>Cato</hi> found by the <hi>Censors tables</hi> the exact time from the expulsion of the Kings, to the time of the Cities being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the <hi>Gauls;</hi> from which time to his own, he could not miss of it from the <hi>Fasti Consulares;</hi> so that it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied but that <hi>Cato</hi> might have a certain account of times from the <hi>Regifugium</hi> to the time he writ his <hi>Origines.</hi> But what certainty <hi>Cato</hi> could have from the first <hi>Palilia</hi> of the City to the <hi>expulsion</hi> of <hi>Tarquin,</hi> we cannot understand. For the succession of <hi>Kings</hi> must needs be very uncertain, unless it be demonstrated from some publick monuments, or certain records, or some publick actions certainly known to have fallen out precisely in such a year of their several Reigns. Now none of these do occur in the <hi>Roman history</hi> in all that <hi>Interval</hi> from the <hi>Palilia</hi> to the <hi>Regifugium;</hi> so that not only the whole interval, but the time of every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>Kings</hi> Reign, are very uncertain. And therefore <hi>Varro</hi> being destitute of any demonstration of that time, had recourse to <hi>L. Tarrutius Firmanus,</hi> to see if by his skill in <hi>Astronomy</hi> he could certainly find out the first <hi>Palilia</hi> of <hi>Rome:</hi> His answer was, that he found that the City was built in the time of an <hi>Eclipse</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> which was in the third year of the sixth <hi>Olympiad,</hi> according to which account <hi>Varro</hi> proceeded, and thence arose the difference between the <hi>Palilia Catoniana</hi> and <hi>Varroniana;</hi> the latter falling out in the 23 of <hi>Iphitus,</hi> the other in the 24.

And thus much may serve to shew the great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of <hi>Heathen Chronology,</hi> as to the giving an account of ancient times.</p>
               <p>And yet were it only an uncertainty as to <hi>Chronology,</hi> we might better bear with it; for the mistake meerly in <note place="margin">

But that which adds much to the <hi>confusion</hi> and <hi>uncertainty</hi> of <hi>Heathen history,</hi> is, <hi>the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency of Impostures,</hi> which are more hard to be discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in that there are no authentick histories of those times extant, which hath both given occasion to variety of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posture, and much hindered their discovery. For the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity of men leading them back into a search after anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent times, it makes them exceeding credulous in embracing whatever pretends to give them any conduct through those dark and obscure paths of ancient history: And the world hath never been wanting of such as would be ready to abuse the simple credulity of well-meaning, but less wary men; but those ages have been most <hi>feracious</hi> in the <hi>production</hi> of such persons, which have pretended to more Learning then they had. The pretence of learning made such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons appear, and the want of it made them not be disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. Thus it was not only of old among the <hi>Chaldean</hi> and <hi>Aegyptian Priests,</hi> and the <hi>Graecian Poets</hi> and <hi>Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> of whom we have spoken already; but even among those who might have learned more truth from the <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> they professed, then to think it stood in need of their lyes. For there can be no greater disparagement offered to truth, then to defend it with any thing but it self, nothing laying truth so open to suspicion, as when falshood comes to be its <hi>advocate:</hi> And a false testimony discovered, doth more prejudice to a good cause, then it could any wayes

advantage it, were it not discovered; and therefore their labours have been as serviceable to the world who have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered <hi>Impostors,</hi> as those who have directly maintained truth against its open opposers, those being so much more dangerous, in that they appear in the disguise of truth, and therefore are with more difficulty discovered. Such a one was that <hi>ignis fatuus</hi> that appeared in a kind of <hi>twilight</hi> in the <hi>Christian</hi> world between the former darkness of <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rism,</hi> and the approaching light of <hi>knowledge;</hi> I mean <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius Viterbiensis,</hi> who like <hi>Hannibal</hi> in passing the <hi>Alps,</hi> not finding a way ready to his mind, sets himself to burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the woods, and firing the rocks, and dissolving them with vinegar to make a passage through them: So <hi>Annius</hi> being beset in those <hi>snowy</hi> and <hi>gray-headed Alps</hi> of ancient history, and finding no way clear for him according to his fancy, he labours to <hi>burn down</hi> all certain <hi>Records,</hi> to <hi>eat through</hi> the credit of undoubted Authors, to make a more free passage for his own history, which he deduceth suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to Scripture from the concurrent testimony of the eldest Historians. To which purpose, a New <hi>Berosus, Manetho, Philo, Metasthenes</hi> (as he mistook for <hi>Megasthenes)</hi> and <hi>Xenophon</hi> must put on a grave disguise, and walk abroad the world with a <hi>mantle</hi> of <hi>Antiquity</hi> about their shoulders, although they were nothing else but aery <hi>Phantasms,</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered over with the <hi>Cowl</hi> of the <hi>Monk</hi> of <hi>Viterbo.</hi> For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself somewhat more versed in the history of those elder times then generally persons were in the age he lived in, he made that unhappy use of his skill, to play the <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebank</hi> with his learning; and to abuse the credulity of those who have better <hi>stomacks</hi> then <hi>palats,</hi> and can sooner swallow down the <hi>compositions</hi> that are given them, then find out the <hi>Ingredients</hi> of them.

were carefully lockt up, and preserved among the <hi>Priests;</hi> and lest at any time others might get a view of them, they were sure to preserve them in a <hi>peculiar Character</hi> distinct from that in civil and common use.

For these learned men being strongly possessed with the opinion of the <hi>modern Iews</hi> concerning the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity</hi> of the present <hi>Hebrew Characters,</hi> and finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves pressed not only with the <hi>Testimony</hi> of some <hi>ancient Rabbins,</hi> but with the stronger evidence of the <hi>ancient she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kels</hi> about <hi>Solomons</hi> time, inscribed with the <hi>Samaritan let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> have at last found this <hi>Evasion,</hi> that the <hi>Samaritan let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> were in <hi>vulgar use;</hi> but the present <hi>Characters</hi> were then <hi>sacred,</hi> and not made <hi>common</hi> till after the time of the <hi>Captivity.</hi> But this seems to be a meer <hi>shift</hi> found out by some modern <hi>Iews,</hi> and greedily embraced by their Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, because thereby they are in hopes to evade the strength of the contrary arguments, which otherwise they can find no probable solution of. And a meer shift it will appear to be, to any one that considers on how little ground of reason it stands: For none of those reasons which held for such a distinction of Characters among the <hi>Heathens,</hi> can have any place among the <hi>Iews.</hi> For it was never any part of <hi>Gods</hi> design to have the Law kept from the peoples view. <hi>Truth</hi> is never so fearful of being <hi>seen abroad;</hi> it is only falshood that walks under disguises, and must have its hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding-places to retreat to: Nay, <hi>God</hi> expresly commanded it as a duty of all the <hi>Iews,</hi> to search and study his Law, which they could not do, if it were locked up from them in an <hi>unknown Character.</hi> Did not <hi>God</hi> himself promulge it among the people of <hi>Israel</hi> by the <hi>Ministry of Moses?</hi> did he not command it to be <hi>as frontlets between their eyes,</hi>

Again, if we suppose the <hi>Law</hi> to be among the people, but in the <hi>vulgar character,</hi> I would fain know, what <hi>sanctity, majesty,</hi> and <hi>authority,</hi> there was in that <hi>character</hi> more then in the words and matter? and if there were, how comes the <hi>vulgar</hi> use of it to be nowhere forbidden? and how durst <hi>Ezra,</hi> as is supposed, after the <hi>Captivity,</hi> profane so <hi>sacred</hi> a thing by exposing it to <hi>Common</hi> use? But granting them yet further, that it was <hi>lawful,</hi> but not <hi>useful</hi> to make use of that <hi>sacred character;</hi> I demand then, how comes that <hi>disuse</hi> to continue so punctually till the time of <hi>Ezra,</hi> and that it should never be divulged before? when there was so great reason to make it common, since the <hi>square letters</hi> are less operose, more expedite and facile, then the <hi>Samaritan,</hi> which is, when time serves, used as a plea for their great <hi>Antiquity.</hi> But yeilding yet more, that the Sacred <hi>Character</hi> was only used for the <hi>authentick coppy</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> which was to decide all differences of other coppies (which some run to as their last shift) I appeal to any mans <hi>reason,</hi> whether this be not the most improbable of all? For how could such a coppy be the <hi>Iudge</hi> of all others, which could not be read or understood by those who appealed to it? Or was the knowledge and reading of this <hi>character</hi> peculiar to the <hi>High Priest,</hi> and conveyed down as a <hi>Cabala</hi> from one to another? but how many incongruities would follow hence, in case one <hi>High Priest</hi> should dye before his son was capable of understanding the letters, and so that Sacred treasure must needs be lost; or had they it all by <hi>inspiration,</hi> and understood the <hi>Sacred Character</hi> by <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim?</hi> Thus every way, this opinion among the <hi>Iews</hi> is pressed with inconveniencies, but it was most suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the <hi>Heathens Priests</hi> to maintain a <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum</hi> between their own Character and the vulgar, For hereby they prohibited all prying into their mysteries by any, but those who had the same <hi>Interest</hi> with themselves, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were unlikely to discover any thing that might lessen their reputation. Whereas, had there been nothing but <hi>Truth</hi> in their <hi>records,</hi> or that <hi>Truth</hi> had been for their <hi>Interest,</hi> what need had there been of so great reserved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and privacy? but when the discovery of truth would

undeceive the world, it was their <hi>Interest</hi> to lock it up, and to give out such things to the <hi>vulgar,</hi> which might advance themselves and please them; which <hi>artifices</hi> of theirs give no small ground to <hi>Question</hi> the <hi>credibility</hi> of their <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories.</hi>
               </p>

How much do the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> tell us of the excellency of their ancient Laws and Government? and yet how evident is it, from their own Histories, that no such Laws were observed by their Kings as they speak of?

their eldest times? no less then 18000. when yet himself confesseth in the time of <hi>Ptolomaeus Lagi</hi> there were reckoned but somewhat above 3000 Cities, and then <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> was the most <hi>populous</hi> that ever it had been. How pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable doth this sound, that in those eldest times such vast multitudes of Cities should be erected? But the truth is, it is not unsuitable to their opinion of the production of the first men, which were caused, say they, by the <hi>heat</hi> of <hi>Sun,</hi> and the <hi>mud</hi> of <hi>Nilus;</hi> and it is certain then they might be the most <hi>populous Nation</hi> in the world: for there could be no defect as to either <hi>efficient</hi> or <hi>material</hi> cause, there being <hi>mud</hi> enough to <hi>produce Myriads,</hi> and the <hi>Sun</hi> hot enough to <hi>impregnate</hi> it. The <hi>partiality</hi> of other Nations hath been already discoursed of in our passage; and so likewise hath their <hi>mutual repugnancy</hi> to, and <hi>inconsistency</hi> with each other: Which yet might be more fully manifested from the <hi>contradictions</hi> in reference to the <hi>Aegyptian History</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Manetho, Herodotus, Diodorus, Dicaearchus, Era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tosthenes,</hi> and all who have spoken of it; as to the <hi>Assyrian Empire</hi> between <hi>Herodotus, Diodorus,</hi> and <hi>Iulius Africanus;</hi> as to the <hi>Persian Empire</hi> between <hi>Herodotus</hi> and <hi>Ctesias,</hi> and those in no inconsiderable things, as is evident in <hi>Photius</hi> his <hi>excerpta</hi> out of him.

For although nothing else be in its self necessary from <hi>God</hi> to <hi>man,</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to his salvation, but the bare <hi>revealing</hi> in a certain way the <hi>terms</hi> on which he must expect it; yet consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the unbounded nature of <hi>Divine goodness,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting not only the good of some particular persons, but of the whole <hi>society</hi> of <hi>mankind,</hi> it stands to the greatest reason that such a <hi>revelation</hi> should be so <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,</hi> as might be with equal <hi>certainty</hi> conveyed to the <hi>community</hi> of <hi>mankind.</hi> Which could not with any such evidence of <hi>credibility</hi> be done by <hi>private</hi> and <hi>particular revelations</hi> (which give satisfaction only to the inward sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of the partakers of them) as by a publick <hi>recording</hi> of the matters of <hi>Divine revelation</hi> by such a <hi>person</hi> who is enabled to give the world all <hi>reasonable satisfaction,</hi> that what he did was not of any private design of his own head, but that he was <hi>deputed</hi> to it by no less then
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:53276:75"/>
                  <hi>Divine authority.</hi> And therefore it stands to the highest reason, that where <hi>Divine revelation</hi> is <hi>necessary</hi> for the certain requiring of <hi>assent,</hi> the <hi>matter</hi> to be <hi>believed</hi> should have a <hi>certain uniform conveyance</hi> to mens minds, rather then that perpetually <hi>New revelations</hi> should be required for the making known of those things; which being once <hi>recorded</hi> are not lyable to so many <hi>impostures</hi> as the other way might have been under pretended <hi>Revelations.</hi> For then men are not put to a continual tryal of every person pretending <hi>Divine revelation,</hi> as to the evidences which he brings of <hi>Divine authority,</hi> but the great <hi>matters</hi> of concernment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing already <hi>recorded</hi> and <hi>attested</hi> by all <hi>rational evidence</hi> as to the truth of the things, their minds therein rest satisfied without being under a <hi>continual hesitancy,</hi> lest the <hi>Revelation</hi> of one should <hi>contradict</hi> another.</p>
               <p>For supposing that <hi>God</hi> had left the <hi>matters</hi> of <hi>Divine</hi>

                  <hi>revelation</hi> unrecorded at all, but left them to be <hi>discovered</hi> in every age by a <hi>spirit of prophecy,</hi> by such a multitude as might be sufficient to inform the world of the truth of the things; We cannot but conceive that an innumerable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of <hi>croaking Enthusiasts</hi> would be continually pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>commissions</hi> from heaven, by which the minds of men would be left in continual <hi>distraction,</hi> because they would have no certain <hi>infallible rules</hi> given them, whereby to difference the <hi>good and evil spirit</hi> from each other. But now supposing God to inspire some particular persons, not only to <hi>reveal,</hi> but to <hi>record Divine truths,</hi> then what ever <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences</hi> can be brought <hi>attesting</hi> a <hi>Divine revelation</hi> in them, will likewise prove the undoubted <hi>certainty</hi> and <hi>infallibility</hi> of those writings, it being impossible that persons employed by a <hi>God</hi> of <hi>truth</hi> should make it their design to impose upon the world; which gives us a <hi>rational account,</hi> why the <hi>wise God</hi> did not suffer the <hi>History</hi> of the <hi>world</hi> to lye still <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recorded,</hi> but made choice of such a <hi>person</hi> to record it, who gave abundant evidence to the world that he acted no pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate design, but was peculiarly employed by <hi>God</hi> himself for the doing of it, as will appear afterwards. Besides, we finde by our former discourse, how lyable the most certain <hi>tradition</hi> is to be corrupted in progress of time, where there
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:53276:76"/>
are no standing records, though it were at first delivered by persons of undoubted credit. For we have no reason to doubt, but that the <hi>tradition</hi> of the <hi>old world,</hi> the <hi>flood</hi> and the <hi>consequences</hi> of it, with the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>worship</hi> of the <hi>true God,</hi> were at first spread over the greatest part of the world in its first <hi>plantations,</hi> yet we see how soon for want of certain <hi>conveyance,</hi> all the antient <hi>tradition</hi> was <hi>corrupted</hi> and abused into the greatest <hi>Idolatry.</hi> Which might be less wondered at, had it been only in those parts which were furthest remote from the seat of those grand transactions; but thus we finde it was even among those <hi>families,</hi> who had the nearest residence to the place of them, and among those persons who were not far off in a lineal <hi>descent</hi> from the persons mainly concerned in them; as is most evident in the <hi>family</hi> out of which <hi>Abraham</hi> came (who was himself the tenth from <hi>Noah)</hi> yet of them it is said, <hi>that they served other Gods.</hi> How unlikely then was it, that this <hi>tradition</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Josh. 24. 2.</note> should be afterwards preserved entire, when the people <hi>God</hi> had peculiarly chosen to himself, were so mixed among the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> and so prone to the <hi>Idolatries</hi> of the Nations round about them, and that even after <hi>God</hi> had given them a written <hi>Law attested</hi> with the greatest <hi>miracles?</hi> what would they have done then, had they never been brought forth of <hi>Aegypt</hi> by such <hi>signs</hi> and <hi>wonders,</hi> and had no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain records left to preserve the memory of former ages? Thus we see how much it stands to the greatest reason, that so memorable things should be digested into sacred re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We have as great certainty that</hi> Moses <hi>was the author of the records going under his name, as we can have of any matter of</hi>

                  <hi>fact done at so great a distance of time from us.</hi> We are to consider that there are two very distinct questions to be thought of concerning a <hi>Divine revelation</hi> to any person at a considerable distance of time from us; and those are <hi>what evidences can be given that the matters recorded are of a true divine revelation; and what evidence we have of the truth of the matter of fact, that such things were recorded by such persons.</hi> They who do not carefully distinguish between these two questions, will soon run themselves into an inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricable
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:53276:76"/>
labyrinth, when they either seek to understand themselves, or explain to others the grounds on which they believe the <hi>Scriptures</hi> to be <hi>the Word of God.</hi> The first step in order to which must be the proving the <hi>undoubted certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the matter of fact,</hi> or the truth of the History, that such <hi>persons</hi> were <hi>really existent,</hi> and did either <hi>do</hi> or <hi>record</hi> the things we speak of: After this, succeeds the other to prove, not only the <hi>real existence</hi> of the things, but that the <hi>persons</hi> who <hi>recorded</hi> the things were <hi>assisted</hi> by an <hi>infallible spirit;</hi> then there can be no reason at all to doubt, but those re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords are the Word of God. The first of these, is, that which at present we enquire after, the certainty of the matter of fact, that the records under the name of <hi>Moses</hi> were undoubtedly his. And here it will be most unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for any to seek for further <hi>evidence</hi> and <hi>demonstration</hi> of it, then the <hi>matter</hi> to be proved is <hi>capable</hi> of. But if they should, I suppose we have sufficient reason to demonstrate the folly of such a demand, and that on these accounts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whoever yet undertook to bring <hi>matters</hi> of <hi>fact</hi> into <hi>Mathematical demonstrations,</hi> or thought he had ground to <note place="margin">1.</note> question the certainty of any thing that was not proved in a <hi>Mathematical</hi> way to him? Who would ever undertake to prove that <hi>Archimedes</hi> was kild at <hi>Syracuse</hi> by any of the <hi>demonstrations</hi> he was then about? or that <hi>Euclide</hi> was the undoubted Author of the <hi>Geometry</hi> under his name? or do men question these things for want of such <hi>demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?</hi> Yet this is all we at present desire, but the same liberty here which is used in any thing of a like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I demand of the <hi>person</hi> who denyes this <hi>moral cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi> to be <hi>sufficient</hi> for an <hi>assent,</hi> whether he doth question <note place="margin">2.</note> every thing in the world, which he was not present at the doing of himself? If he be peremptorily resolved to <hi>believe</hi> nothing but <hi>what</hi> he <hi>sees,</hi> he is fit for nothing but a <hi>voyage</hi> to <hi>Anticyrae,</hi> or to be soundly <hi>purged</hi> with <hi>Hellebore</hi> to free him from those <hi>cloudy humours</hi> that make him suspect the whole world to be an <hi>imposture.</hi> But we cannot suppose any man so destitute of reason, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

doth then <hi>firmly believe</hi> any thing, there must be supposed sufficient <hi>grounds</hi> to induce him to such a belief. And then what ground can there be to question the <hi>certainty</hi> of such things which have as great evidence as any of those things have which he most firmly believes? and this is all we desire from him.</p>

                  <hi>actions</hi> of mens <hi>lives,</hi> are built on no other <hi>foundation</hi> then this <hi>moral certainty?</hi> yet men do not in the least question the truth of the thing they rely upon: As is most evident in all <hi>titles</hi> to <hi>estates</hi> derived from <hi>Ancestors,</hi> either by <hi>donation</hi> or <hi>purchase:</hi> In all <hi>trading</hi> which goes upon the <hi>moral cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,</hi> that there are such places as the <hi>Indyes,</hi> or <hi>France,</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> &amp;c.

In short, then, either we must destroy all <hi>Historical faith</hi> out of the world, and believe nothing (though never so much attested) but what we see our selves, or else we must acknowledge, that a <hi>moral certainty</hi> is a <hi>sufficient foundation</hi> for an <hi>undoubted assent,</hi> not such a one <hi>cui non potest subesse falsum,</hi> but such a one <hi>cui non subest dubium, i. e.</hi> an <hi>assent undoubted,</hi> though not <hi>infallible.</hi> By which we see what little reason the <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Which I now come to prove, as to the subject in hand; <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 4.</note> viz. <hi>that the writings of</hi> Moses <hi>are undoubtedly his,</hi> which I prove by a <hi>twofold</hi> argument: 1. <hi>An universal consent of persons, who were best able to know the truth of the things in question.</hi> 2. <hi>The setling of a Commonwealth upon the Laws delivered by</hi> Moses. 1. <hi>The universal Consent of persons most capable of judging in the Case in hand.</hi> I know nothing the most scrupulous and inquisitive mind can possibly desire in order to satisfaction, concerning any matter of fact be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond an <hi>universal Consent</hi> of such persons who have a greater <hi>capacity</hi> of <hi>knowing</hi> the <hi>truth</hi> of it then we can have. And those are all such persons who have lived nearest those times when the things were done, and have best understood the affairs of the times when the things were pretended to be done. Can we possibly conceive, that among the people of the <hi>Iews,</hi> who were so exceedingly prone to transgress the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moses,</hi> and to <hi>fall</hi> into <hi>Idolatry,</hi> but if there had been any the least suspition of any falsity or imposture in the writing of <hi>Moses,</hi> the ringleaders of their revolts would have sufficiently promulged it among them, as the most <hi>plausible plea</hi> to draw them off from the worship of the true <hi>God?</hi> Can we think that a Nation and religion so <hi>maligned</hi> as the <hi>Iewish</hi> were, could have escaped <hi>discovery,</hi> if there had been any deceit in it, when so many lay in wait continually to expose them to all <hi>Contumelies</hi> imaginable? Nay, among themselves in their frequent <hi>Apostacies,</hi> and occasions given for such a pretence, how comes this to be never <hi>heard</hi> of, nor in the least questioned, whether the <hi>Law</hi> was <hi>undoubtedly</hi> of <hi>Moses</hi> his writing or no? What an excellent plea would this have been for <hi>Ieroboams Calves</hi> in <hi>Dan and Bethel;</hi> for the <hi>Samaritans Temple</hi> on <hi>Mount Gerizim,</hi> could any the least suspition have been raised among them, concerning the <hi>aut bentickness</hi> of the <hi>fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal records</hi> of the <hi>Iewish Commonwealth?</hi> And which is most observable, the <hi>Iews</hi> who were a people strangely <hi>suspitious</hi> and <hi>incredulous,</hi> while they were <hi>fed</hi> and <hi>clothed</hi> with <hi>mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> yet could never find ground to question this. Nay, and <hi>Moses</hi> himself, we plainly see, was hugely <hi>envied</hi> by many of the <hi>Israelites</hi> even in the <hi>wilderness,</hi> as is evident
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:53276:78"/>
in the <hi>Conspiracy</hi> of <hi>Corah</hi> and his complices, and that on this very ground, <hi>that he took too much upon him;</hi> how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely then is it, that amidst so many enemies he should dare to venture any thing into <hi>publick records,</hi> which was not most <hi>undoubtedly true,</hi> or undertake to prescribe a <hi>Law</hi> to oblige the people to posterity? Or that after his own age any thing should come out under his name, which would not be presently detected by the <hi>emulato<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Were not they able to understand the <hi>truth</hi> of it? What? not those, who were in the same age, and conveyed it down by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain tradition to posterity? Or did not the <hi>Israelites</hi> all constantly <hi>believe</hi> it? What? not they, who would sooner part with their <hi>lives</hi> and <hi>fortunes,</hi> then admit any <hi>variation</hi> or alteration as to their <hi>Law?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well, but if we should suppose <hi>the whole Iewish Nation</hi>

                  <hi>partial to themselves, and that out of honour to the memory of so great a person as</hi> Moses, <hi>they should attribute their ancient Laws and records to him:</hi> Which is all that <hi>Infidelity</hi> its self can imagine in this Case: Yet this cannot be with any sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of reason pretended.

               <p n="1">1. Who were those <hi>persons,</hi> who did give out this <hi>Law</hi> to the <hi>Iews</hi> under <hi>Moses</hi> his name?

nature could be forged of him. If <hi>after,</hi> then I demand, whether the people had observed the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moses</hi> before or no? if <hi>not,</hi> then they must certainly know it at the time of its <hi>promulgation</hi> to be <hi>counterfeit,</hi> for had it been from <hi>Moses,</hi> it would have been observed before their times; if <hi>it was observed before,</hi> then either <hi>continually</hi> down from the time of <hi>Moses,</hi> or not? If <hi>continually down,</hi> then it was of <hi>Moses</hi> his doing, if we suppose him to have had that <hi>authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> among the people which the <hi>objection</hi> supposeth; <hi>if not,</hi> then still the nearer <hi>Moses</hi> his time, the more <hi>difficult</hi> such a <hi>counterfeiting</hi> could be; because the <hi>Constitutions</hi> which <hi>Moses</hi> had left among them, would have remained in their <hi>memories,</hi> whereby they would easily reject all <hi>pretences</hi> and <hi>counterfeits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. How can we conceive the Nation of the <hi>Iews</hi> would have ever embraced such a <hi>Law,</hi> had it not been of <hi>Moses</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3.</note> his enacting among them in that state of time when he did?

               </p>
               <p>These <hi>considerations</hi> make it so clear, that it is almost <hi>impossible</hi> to conceive the Nation of the <hi>Iews</hi> could have <note place="margin">

               <p>HAving thus far cleared our way, we come to the third <note place="margin">

appear to the world, that he is one wholly forsaken of his own reason: which will be satisfactorily done, if we can clear these things: <hi>First, that it was morally impossible</hi> Moses <hi>should be ignorant of the things he undertook to write of, and so be deceived himself. Secondly, That it was utterly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible he should have any design in deceiving others in report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. Thirdly, That it is certain from all rational evidence, that he hath not d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Two</hi> things are requisite to prevent a mans being deceived himself. <hi>First, That he be a person of more then ordinary judgement, wisdom, and knowledge. Secondly, That we have sufficient information concerning the things he undertakes to write of.</hi> If either of these two be wanting, it is possible for a man of integrity to be deceived; for an <hi>honest heart</hi> hath not alwayes an <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> upon it; nor is fide<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

First, <hi>Then that</hi> Moses <hi>was a person of a great understanding, and suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently qualified to put a difference between truth and falshood,</hi> will appear; first, <hi>from the ingenuity of his education;</hi> secondly, <hi>from the ripeness of his judgement and greatness of his experience when he penned these things.</hi>

                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 2.</note> so much the repute of the antient <hi>Aegyptian Learning,</hi> as that the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in Scripture should take so much no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it, as to set forth a person (otherwise renowned for greater accomplishments) by his <hi>skill</hi> in this. For if it be below the <hi>wisdom</hi> of any ordinary person, to set forth a person by that which in its self is no matter of <hi>commendation,</hi> how much less can we imagine it of that infinite wisdom which inspired <hi>Stephen</hi> in that <hi>Apology</hi> which he makes for himself against the <hi>Libertines,</hi> who charged him with <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt</hi> of <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Law?</hi> And therefore certainly this was some very <hi>observable</hi> thing, which was brought in as a singular commendation of <hi>Moses,</hi> by that person whose design was to make it appear how high an esteem he had of him. And hence it appears that <hi>Learning</hi> is not only in its self a great <hi>accomplishment</hi> of <hi>humane nature,</hi> but that it ought to be looked upon with <hi>veneration,</hi> even in those who have excellencies of a higher nature to commend them. If a <hi>Pearl</hi> retains its <hi>excellency</hi> when it lyes upon a <hi>dunghill,</hi> it can certainly <hi>lose</hi> nothing of its <hi>lustre</hi> by being set in a <hi>crown of gold;</hi> if Learning be commendable in an <hi>Aegyptian,</hi> it is no less in <hi>Moses,</hi> where it is <hi>enameled</hi> with more noble per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, then of it self it can reach unto. All the question is, Whither the antient learning of the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> was such as might be supposed to improve the reason and understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of men to such an height, as thereby to make them more capable of putting a difference between truth and falshood? Whether it were such an overflowing <hi>Nilus</hi> as would <hi>enrich</hi> the <hi>understandings</hi> of all those who were in a capacity to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive its streams? The truth is, there want not grounds of suspicion, that the old <hi>Aegyptian Learning</hi> was not of that <hi>elevation</hi> which the present distance of our age makes us apt to think it was. And a learned man hath in a set discourse endeavoured to shew the great <hi>defects</hi> that there were in it; <note place="margin">

and the rest <hi>short</hi> of that <hi>improvement,</hi> which the accession of the parts and industry of after ages gave unto it. But yet it is again as evident, that some parts of learning were <hi>invented</hi> by the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> others much <hi>improved,</hi> and that the <hi>Greeks</hi> did at first <hi>set up</hi> with the <hi>stock</hi> they <hi>borrowed</hi> out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and that learning chiefly flourished there, when there was (I had almost said) an <hi>Aegyptian darkness</hi> of <hi>Ignorance</hi> overspreading the face of <hi>Greece</hi> as well as other Nations.</p>

Whence it is most natural and easie to argue, that certainly their learning must be accounted the greatest at that time in the world, or else it could not have been inferred, that <hi>Solomon</hi> was <hi>wiser</hi> then <hi>all men,</hi> because his <hi>wisdom</hi> excelled <hi>theirs,</hi> unless we suppose their <hi>wisdom</hi> to have been the <hi>greatest</hi> in that age of the world, when the <hi>wisdom</hi> of the <hi>Graecians</hi> (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in that time <hi>Homer</hi> is supposed to flourish) was not thought worthy the taking notice of.

                  <p>Moses <hi>considered as an Historian, and as a Lawgiver; his fidelity in both proved: clear evidences that he had no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to deceive in his History, freedom from private interest, impartiality in his relations, plainness and perspicuity of stile. As a Lawgiver, he came armed with Divine au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, which being the main thing, is fixed on to be fully proved from his actions and writings. The power of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles the great evidence of Divine revelation. Two grand questions propounded. In what cases miracles may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, and how known to be true. No necessity of a constant power of miracles in a Church: Two Cases alone wherein they may be expected. When any thing comes as a Law from God, and when a Divine Law is to be repealed The necessity of miracles in those cases as an evidence of Divine revelation asserted. Objections answered. No use of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles when the doctrine is setled and owned by miracles in the first revelation. No need of miracles in reformation of a Church.</hi>

               <p>THE second <hi>proposition</hi> contains the proof of <hi>Moses</hi> his <hi>fidelity, that he was as far from having any intent to</hi>

                  <hi>deceive others, as he was being deceived himself.</hi> Two wayes <hi>Moses</hi> must be considered, as an <hi>Historian,</hi> and as a <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver;</hi> the only <hi>inducement</hi> for him to deceive as an <hi>Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,</hi> must be some particular <hi>interest</hi> which must draw him aside from an impartial delivery of the truth; as a <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver</hi> he might <hi>deceive,</hi> if he <hi>pretended Divine revelation</hi> for those <hi>Laws</hi> which were only the issues of his own brain, that they might be received with a greater <hi>veneration</hi> among the people, as <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> and others did.

                  <hi>fidelity</hi> of <hi>Moses</hi> in every thing <hi>recorded</hi> by him.

For it is otherwise in <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals</hi> then in <hi>naturals;</hi> for in <hi>naturals,</hi> we see that every thing will leave its <hi>proper interest</hi> to preserve the <hi>common interest</hi> of <hi>nature;</hi> but in <hi>morals,</hi> there is nothing more common then <hi>deserting</hi> the <hi>common interest</hi> of mankind, to set up a <hi>pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar interest</hi> against it: It being the truest description of a <hi>Politician,</hi> that he is one who makes himself the <hi>centre,</hi> and the <hi>whole world</hi> his <hi>circumference;</hi> that he regards not how much the whole world is abused, if any advantage doth accrue to himself by it. Where we see it then the design of any person to <hi>advance himself</hi> or his posterity, or to set up the <hi>credit</hi> of the <hi>Nation</hi> whose <hi>History</hi> he writes, we may have just cause to suspect his <hi>partiality,</hi> because we then finde a sufficient inducement for such a one to leave the common <hi>road</hi> of truth, and to fall into the <hi>paths</hi> of deceit. But we have not the least ground to suspect any such <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality</hi> in the <hi>History</hi> of <hi>Moses;</hi> for nothing is more clear then that he was free from the <hi>ambitious design</hi> of <hi>advancing himself</hi> and his <hi>posterity.</hi> who notwithstanding the great <hi>honour</hi> he enjoyed himself, was content to leave his <hi>posterity</hi> in the meanest sort of <hi>attendance</hi> upon the <hi>Tabernacle.</hi> And as little have we ground to think he intended to <hi>flatter</hi> that <hi>Nation,</hi> which he so lively describes, that one would think he had rather an interest to set forth the <hi>frowardness, unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, unthankfulness,</hi> and <hi>disobedience</hi> of a <hi>Nation</hi> towards a <hi>Gracious God,</hi> then any wayes to <hi>inhance</hi> their <hi>reputation</hi> in the world, or to ingratiate himself with them by writing this History of them. Nay, and he sets forth so exactly the <hi>lesser failings</hi> and <hi>grosser enormities</hi> of all the <hi>Ancestours</hi> of this Nation whose acts he <hi>records,</hi> that any impartial reader will soon acquit him of a design of <hi>flattery,</hi> when after he hath <hi>recorded</hi> those <hi>faults,</hi> he seeks not to <hi>extenuate</hi> them, or bring any <hi>excuse</hi> or pretence to <hi>palliate</hi> them.

any observing reader may easily take notice, that he was carried on by a higher design then the <hi>common people</hi> of <hi>Historians</hi> are, and that his drift and scope was to <hi>exalt</hi> the <hi>goodness and favour of God,</hi> towards a <hi>rebellious</hi> and <hi>obstinate people.</hi> Of which there can be no greater nor more lively <hi>demonstration,</hi> then the <hi>History</hi> of all the <hi>transactions</hi> of the <hi>Iewish Nation,</hi> from their coming forth of <hi>Aegypt</hi> to their utter <hi>ruine</hi> and <hi>desolation.</hi> And <hi>Moses</hi> tells them as from <hi>God</hi> himself, <hi>it was neither for their number, nor their good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that God set his Love upon them, but he loved them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he loved them; i. e.</hi> no other account was to be given <note place="margin">Deut. 7. 7, 8.</note> of his gracious dealing with them, but the <hi>freeness</hi> of his own <hi>bonnty,</hi> and the <hi>exuberancy</hi> of his <hi>goodness</hi> towards them.

                  <hi>such as could not flow from the power of meer natural causes,</hi> and <hi>if the things he reveals be such as could not proceed from any created understanding.</hi> First then, <hi>for his actions,</hi> these striking most upon our <hi>outward senses</hi> when they are any thing <hi>extraordinary,</hi> do <hi>transmit</hi> along with the <hi>impressions</hi> of them to the <hi>understanding,</hi> an <hi>high opinion</hi> of the <hi>person</hi> that does them: Whereas the meer <hi>height</hi> of knowledge, or <hi>profoundness</hi> of things discovered, can have no such pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <hi>power</hi> and <hi>influence</hi> upon any, but such as are of more <hi>raised</hi> and <hi>inquisitive minds.</hi> And the world is generally more apt to suspect its self deceived with <hi>words,</hi> then it can be with <hi>actions;</hi> and hence <hi>Miracles,</hi> or the doing of things above the reach of nature, hath been alwayes embraced as the greatest testimony of <hi>Divine authority</hi> and <hi>revelation.</hi> For which there is this evident reason, that the course of nature being setled by divine power, and every thing acting there by the force of that power it received at first, it seems <hi>impossible</hi> that any thing should really alter the <hi>series</hi> of things, without the same power which at first produced them. This then we take for granted, <hi>that where ever such a power appears, there is a certain evidence of a Divine presence going along with such a person who enjoyes it.</hi> And this is that which is most evident in the <hi>actions of Moses,</hi> both as to the <hi>Miracles</hi> he wrought, both in <hi>Aegypt</hi> and the <hi>Wilderness,</hi> and his <hi>miraculous deliverance</hi> of the <hi>Israelites</hi> out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> this latter being as much above the reach of any meerly <hi>civil power,</hi> as the other above <hi>natural.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We therefore come to the <hi>rational evidence</hi> of that <hi>divine authority</hi> whereby <hi>Moses</hi> acted, which may be gathered <note place="margin">

Whether they are such undoubted <hi>credentials,</hi> that where ever they are produced, we are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:53276:92"/>
to receive the <hi>persons</hi> who bring them, as extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Embassadors</hi> from heaven, imployed on some peculiar <hi>message</hi> to the <hi>sons of men?</hi> For the full stating of this <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant question, two</hi> things must be cleared: First, <hi>In what cases miracles may be expected as credentials to confirm an immediate commission from heaven?</hi> Secondly, <hi>What ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal evidence do attend those miracles, to assure us they are such as they pretend to be?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> For <hi>the cases wherein these miracles are to be expected as inducements to, or confirmations of our faith, concerning the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1.</note> 
                  <hi>Divine imployment of any persons in the world.</hi> And here I lay down this as a certain foundation, <hi>that a power of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles is not constantly and perpetually necessary in all those who mannage the affairs of Heaven here on earth, or that act in the name of God in the world.</hi> When the <hi>doctrine</hi> of <hi>faith</hi> is once <hi>setled</hi> in <hi>sacred records,</hi> and the <hi>divine revelation</hi> of that <hi>doctrine</hi> sufficiently <hi>attested,</hi> by a <hi>power</hi> of <hi>miracles</hi> in the <hi>revealers</hi> of it, What imaginable necessity or pretext can there be for a contrived power of miracles, especially among such as already own the <hi>Divine revelation</hi> of the <hi>Scriptures?</hi> To make then a power of working miracles to be constantly resident in the Church of God, as one of the necessary <hi>notes</hi> and <hi>characters</hi> of it, is to put <hi>God</hi> upon that necessity which common nature is freed from, <hi>viz.</hi> of mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying things without sufficient cause to be given for them; and to leave mens faith at a stand, when <hi>God</hi> hath given sufficient testimony for it to rely upon. It is a thing too common and easie to be observed, that some persons out of their eagerness to uphold the interest of their own party, have been fain to establish it upon such grounds, which when they are sufficiently searched to the bottom, do apparently undermine the common and sure foundations whereon the belief of our common <hi>Christianity</hi> doth mainly stand. It were easie to make a large discourse on this subject, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may rip open the wounds that <hi>Christianity</hi> hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, through the contentions of the several parties of it; but this <hi>imputation</hi> cannot with so much reason be fastened on any party, as that which is nailed to a pretended <hi>infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible chair;</hi> for which we need no other instance, then this
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:53276:92"/>
before us. For while the leaders of that party make a <hi>power</hi> of <hi>miracles</hi> to be a necessary <hi>note</hi> of the <hi>true Church,</hi> they unavoidably run men upon this dangerous precipice, not to believe any thing as a matter of faith, where they find not sufficient <hi>miracles</hi> to convince them that is the <hi>true Church</hi> which propounds it to them. Which necessarily follows from their acknowledged principles, for it being impossible ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to them, to believe any thing with a <hi>divine faith,</hi> but what is propounded by the <hi>Church</hi> as an <hi>infallible</hi> guide, and it being impossible to know which is this <hi>infallible</hi> guide, but by the <hi>notes</hi> and <hi>characters</hi> of it, and one of those <hi>notes</hi> being a <hi>power</hi> of <hi>miracles,</hi> I cannot find out my <hi>guide</hi> but by this <hi>power;</hi> and this <hi>power</hi> must be <hi>present</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> (for nothing of former ages concerning faith, as the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> his <hi>resurrection,</hi> &amp;c. is to be believed, but on the Churches account) and therefore where men do not find sufficient <hi>conviction</hi> from <hi>present miracles,</hi> to believe the <hi>Church</hi> to be an infallible guide, they must throw off all faith concerning the <hi>Gospel;</hi> for as good never a whit, as never the better. And therefore it is no wonder <hi>At<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eism</hi> should be so <hi>thriving</hi> a plant in <hi>Italy,</hi> nay under, if not within the walls of <hi>Rome</hi> it self, where inquisitive persons do daily see the <hi>juglings</hi> and <hi>impostures</hi> of <hi>Priests</hi> in their pretended miracles, and from thence are brought to look upon Religion its self as a meer imposture, and to think no <hi>Pope</hi> so infallible as he that said, <hi>Quantum nobis profuit haec de Christo fabula?</hi> Such horrid consequences do men drive others, if not bring themselves to, when they imploy their parts and industry rather to uphold a <hi>corrupt interest,</hi> then to promote the belief of the acknowledged principles of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian faith. But as long as we assert no <hi>necessity</hi> of such a <hi>power</hi> of <hi>miracles</hi> to be the <hi>note</hi> of any true Church, nor any such <hi>necessity</hi> of an <hi>infallible guide,</hi> but that the <hi>miracles</hi> wrought by <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles,</hi> were sufficient <hi>eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> of a <hi>divine spirit</hi> in them; and that the <hi>Scriptures</hi> were <hi>recorded</hi> by them to be an <hi>infallible</hi> rule of faith, here we have more clear reason as to the primary <hi>motives</hi> and <hi>grounds</hi> of faith, and withall the <hi>infallible veracity</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in the Scriptures, as the last <hi>resolution</hi> of <hi>faith.</hi> And while we
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:53276:93"/>
assert such an <hi>infallible rule</hi> of <hi>faith,</hi> delivered to us by such an unanimous consent from the first delivery of it, and then so fully <hi>attested</hi> by such <hi>uncontroulable miracles,</hi> we cannot in the least understand to what end a power of miracles should now serve in the <hi>Church,</hi> especially among those who all believe the Scriptures to be the <hi>Word of God.</hi> Indeed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the great <hi>harvest</hi> of <hi>Converts</hi> in the <hi>primitive times</hi> were brought in, both of <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> sully setled in receiving the <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>Scriptures</hi> uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally, we find <hi>God</hi> did continue this power among them; but after the <hi>books</hi> of the <hi>New Testament</hi> were generally imbraced as the rule of faith among <hi>Christians,</hi> we find them so far from pretending to any such power, that they reject the pretenders to it, such as the <hi>Donatists</hi> were, and plead upon the same accounts as we do now against the <hi>necessity</hi> of it. We see then no reason in the world for <hi>miracles</hi> to be continued where the doctrine of faith is setled, as being confirmed by <hi>miracles</hi> in the first preachers of it.</p>
               <p>There are only these <hi>two</hi> cases then, wherein <hi>miracles</hi> may justly and with reason be expected. First, <hi>when any person</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 4.</note> 
                  <hi>comes as by an extraordinary commission from God to the world, either to deliver some peculiar message, or to do some more then ordinary service.</hi> Secondly, <hi>When something that hath been before established by Divine Law, is to be repealed, and some other way of worship established in stead of it.</hi> First, <hi>When any comes upon an extraordinary message to the world, in the name of, and by commission from God,</hi> then it is but reason to require some more then ordinary <hi>evidence</hi> of such <hi>authority.</hi> Because of the main importance of the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of giving credit to such a person, and the great sin of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing guilty of rejecting that divine authority which appears in him. And in this case we cannot think that <hi>God</hi> would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it as a <hi>duty</hi> to believe, where he doth not give suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>arguments</hi> for <hi>faith,</hi> nor that he will punish persons for such a fault, which an <hi>invincible ignorance</hi> was the cause of. Indeed <hi>God</hi> doth not use to <hi>necessitate</hi> faith, as to the act of it, but he doth so clearly <hi>propound</hi> the <hi>object</hi> of it, with all arguments inducing to it, as may sufficiently justifie a <hi>Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers choice</hi> in point of <hi>reason</hi> and <hi>prudence,</hi> and may leave all
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:53276:93"/>
unbelievers without excuse. I cannot see what account a man can give to himself of his faith, much less what <hi>Apology</hi> he can make to others for it, unless he be sufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, in point of the <hi>highest reason,</hi> that it was his <hi>duty</hi> to <hi>believe;</hi> and in order to that <hi>conviction,</hi> there must be some clear <hi>evidence</hi> given, that what is spoken hath the <hi>impress</hi> of <hi>Divine authority</hi> upon it. Now what convictions there can be to any sober mind concerning <hi>Divine authority</hi> in any person without such a <hi>power</hi> of <hi>miracles</hi> going along with him, when he is to deliver some <hi>new doctrine</hi> to the world to be believed, I confess I cannot understand. For although I doubt not but where ever <hi>God</hi> doth <hi>reveal</hi> any thing to any person immediately, he gives <hi>demonstrable evidence</hi> to the inward <hi>senses</hi> of the <hi>soul,</hi> that it comes from himself, yet this <hi>inward sense</hi> can be no <hi>ground</hi> to another person to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi> his <hi>doctrine divine,</hi> because no man can be a <hi>competent judge</hi> of the <hi>actings</hi> of anothers <hi>senses;</hi> and it is impossible to another person to distinguish the <hi>actings</hi> of the <hi>divine Spirit</hi> from strong <hi>impressions</hi> of <hi>fancy</hi> by the <hi>force</hi> and <hi>energy</hi> of them. If it be said, <hi>that we are bound to believe those, who say they are fully satisfied of their Divine Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Object.</note> I answer, <hi>First,</hi> this will expose us to all <hi>delusions</hi> imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable; <note place="margin">Answ.</note> for if we are bound to believe them <hi>because</hi> they say so, <note place="margin">1.</note> we are bound to believe <hi>all</hi> which say so; and none are more confident pretenders to this then the greatest deceivers, as the experience of our age will sufficiently witness. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Men must necessarly be bound to believe <hi>contradictions;</hi> for nothing more ordinary, then for such confident <hi>pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2.</note> to a <hi>Divine Spirit,</hi> to <hi>contradict</hi> one another, and it may be, the same person in a little time <hi>contradict himself:</hi> and must we still be bound to believe all they say? If so, no <hi>Philosophers</hi> would be so much in request, as those <hi>Aristotle</hi> disputes against in his <hi>Metaphysicks,</hi> who thought a thing might be, and not be, at the same time. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The <hi>ground</hi> of <hi>faith</hi> at last will be but a meer <hi>humane testimony,</hi> as far as <note place="margin">3</note> the person who is to believe is capable of judging of it. For the <hi>Question</hi> being, Whether the person I am to believe hath <hi>divine authority</hi> for what he saith, What ground can I have to believe that he hath so? Must I take his <hi>bare affirmation</hi>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:53276:94"/>
for it? If so, then a meer humane <hi>testimony</hi> must be the ground of <hi>divine faith,</hi> and that which it is last resolved into; if it be said <hi>that I am to believe the divine authority by which he speaks, when he speaks in the name of God:</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, the <hi>question</hi> will again return, how I shall know he speaks this from <hi>divine authority?</hi> and so there must be a progress <hi>in infinitum,</hi> or founding <hi>divine faith</hi> on a meer humane testimony, if I am to believe <hi>divine revelation</hi> meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the account of the persons affirmation who pretends unto it. For in this case it holds good, <hi>non apparentis &amp; non existentis eadem est ratio,</hi> if he be divinely inspired, and there be no ground inducing me to believe that he is so, I shall be excused, if I believe him not, if my wilfulness and laziness be not the cause of my unbelief.</p>
               <p>If it be said <hi>that God will satisfie the minds of good men</hi>

                  <hi>concerning the truth of divine revelation.</hi> I grant it to be wonderfully true, but all the question is <hi>de modo,</hi> how God will satisfie them? whether meerly by inspiration of his own spirit in them, assuring them that it is <hi>God</hi> that speaks in such persons; or by giving them <hi>rational evidence,</hi> convincing them of sufficient grounds to believe it. If we assert the former way, we run into these inconveniences; <hi>First</hi> we make as <hi>immediate</hi> a <hi>revelation</hi> in all those who believe, as in <note place="margin">1.</note> those who are to <hi>reveal divine truths</hi> to us, for there is a new revelation of an <hi>object</hi> immediately to the <hi>mind;</hi> viz. <hi>that such a person is inspired of God;</hi> and so is not after the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon way of the <hi>Spirits illumination</hi> in <hi>Believers,</hi> which is by <hi>inlightning</hi> the <hi>faculty,</hi> without the <hi>proposition</hi> of any new <hi>object,</hi> as it is in the <hi>work</hi> of <hi>Grace:</hi> So that according to this opinion, there must be <hi>immediate inspiration</hi> as to that <hi>act</hi> of <hi>faith,</hi> whereby we believe any one to have been <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely inspired,</hi> and consequently to that whereby we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <hi>the Scriptures to be the Word of God. Secondly,</hi> Doth <note place="margin">2.</note> not this make the fairest plea for mens <hi>unbelief?</hi> For I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, Is it the duty of those who want that <hi>immediate il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination</hi> to <hi>believe</hi> or no? If it be not their duty, <hi>unbelief</hi> can be no <hi>sin</hi> to them; if it be a <hi>duty,</hi> it must be made known to be a <hi>duty;</hi> and how can that be made known to them to be a <hi>duty,</hi> when they want the only and necessary means of
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:53276:94"/>
                  <hi>instruction</hi> in order to it? Will <hi>God</hi> condemn them for that, which it was <hi>impossible</hi> they should have, unless <hi>God</hi> gave it them? And how can they be left <hi>inexcuseable,</hi> who want so much as <hi>rational inducements</hi> to faith? for of these I now speak, and not of <hi>efficacious perswasions</hi> of the mind, when there are <hi>rational arguments</hi> for <hi>faith propounded.</hi> But <hi>last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3.</note> I suppose the case will be cleared, when we take notice what course <hi>God</hi> hath alwayes taken to give all <hi>rational satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction</hi> to the <hi>minds</hi> of men, concerning the persons whom he hath imployed in either of the fore-mentioned cases. <hi>First, for those who have been imployed upon some special mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage and service for God,</hi> he hath sent them forth sufficiently provided with manifestations of the <hi>Divine power</hi> whereby they acted: As is most clear and evident in the present case of <hi>Moses, Exodus</hi> 4. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. where <hi>Moses</hi> puts the case to <hi>God</hi> which we are now debating of. Supposing, saith he, that I should go to the <hi>Israelites</hi> and tell them, <hi>God</hi> had appeared to me, and sent me to deliver them, and they should say <hi>God</hi> had not appeared unto me, how should I satisfie them? <hi>God</hi> doth not reject this <hi>objection</hi> of <hi>Moses</hi> as favouring of <hi>unbelief,</hi> but presently shews him how he should satisfie them, by causing a <hi>miracle</hi> before his face, <hi>turning his rod into a Serpent;</hi> and <hi>God</hi> gives this as the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of it, <hi>vers.</hi> 5. <hi>That they may believe that the Lord God of their Fathers, the God of</hi> Abraham, <hi>the God of</hi> Isaac, <hi>the God of</hi> Jacob, <hi>hath appeared unto thee.</hi> It seems <hi>God</hi> himself thought this would be the most <hi>pregnant</hi> evidence of <hi>Gods</hi> appearing to him, if he wrought <hi>miracles</hi> before their faces. Nay, lest they should think one single miracle was not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, <hi>God</hi> in the immediate following verses adjoyns two more, which he should do in order to their satisfaction; and further, verse 21. <hi>God</hi> gave him a charge to do all those wonders before <hi>Pharoah,</hi> which he had put into his hand. And accordingly we find <hi>Pharoah</hi> presently demanding a <hi>miracle</hi> of <hi>Moses, Exodus</hi> 7. 9. which accordingly <hi>Moses</hi> did in his presence, though he might suppose <hi>Pharoahs</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand not to proceed from desire of satisfaction, but from some hopes that for want of it, he might have rendred his credit suspected among the <hi>Israelites.</hi>

For the <hi>doctrine</hi> is supposed to be already <hi>esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished</hi> by <hi>miracles,</hi> according to which we are to judge of the <hi>spirits</hi> of such <hi>pretenders.</hi> Now it stands to the greatest reason, that when a <hi>Religion</hi> is once <hi>established</hi> by uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouled <hi>miracles,</hi> we should not hearken to every whiffling <hi>Conjurer</hi> that will pretend to do great feats, to draw us off from the truth established. In which case, the surest way to discover the <hi>imposture,</hi> is to compare his pretended <hi>miracles</hi> with those <hi>true</hi> and <hi>real</hi> ones which were done by <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Christ;</hi> and the ground of it is, because every person is no competent <hi>judge</hi> of the truth of a <hi>miracle;</hi> for the <hi>Devil</hi> by his power and subtilty, may easily deceive all such as will be led by the nose by him, in expectation of some wonders to be done by him. And therefore as long as we have no ground to question the <hi>oertainty</hi> of those <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles</hi> which were wrought by <hi>Christ</hi> or <hi>Moses,</hi> I am bound to adhere to the <hi>doctrine</hi> established by those miracles, and to make them my rule of judging all persons who shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to work miracles: Because, 1.

                  <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                  <hi>wonders,</hi> whereby many should be deceived. Now this part of the doctrine of the <hi>Gospel</hi> is as certainly true as any of the rest; for it was confirmed by the same <hi>miracles</hi> that the other was; and besides that, the very coming of such <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles</hi> is an evidence of the truth of it, it falling out so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly according to what was foretold so many hundred years since. Now if this <hi>doctrine</hi> be true, then am I certain the intent of these <hi>miracles</hi> is to <hi>deceive,</hi> and that those are deceived who hearken to them; and what reason then have I to believe them? 3.

Were these truths sufficiently proved to be from <hi>God</hi> before or no?

               <p>If men pretend to deliver any doctrine <hi>contrary</hi> to the <hi>Scripture;</hi> then it is not only <hi>necessary</hi> that they <hi>confirm</hi> it by <hi>miracles,</hi> but they must manifest the <hi>falsity</hi> of those <hi>miracles</hi> on which that <hi>doctrine</hi> is believed, or else they must use another miracle to prove that <hi>God</hi> will set his <hi>seal</hi> to <hi>confirm</hi> both <hi>parts</hi> of a <hi>contradiction</hi> to be true.

Thus <hi>Origen</hi> in his excellent books against <hi>Celsus,</hi> shews the necessity of the <hi>prophetical office</hi> among the <hi>Iews</hi> from hence; <hi>for,</hi> saith he, <hi>it being written in their Law that the Gentiles hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kend unto Oracles and Divinations; but God would not suffer</hi>

First, for the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal and institution of these Schools of the Prophets.</hi> The first <hi>Seminaries,</hi> or <hi>places</hi> of institution among the <hi>Iews,</hi> were the <hi>Cities</hi> of the <hi>Levites,</hi> which were dispersed up and down in the several <hi>Tribes</hi> of <hi>Israel; God</hi> thereby turning that into a blessing, which was pronounced as a <hi>curse</hi> upon <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi</hi> by his Father <hi>Iacob,</hi> viz. <hi>that he should be divided in Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, and scattered in Israel.</hi> But though the fulfilling of that <note place="margin">Gen. 49. 7.</note> prophecie might be the primary ground o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>God</hi> sent the <hi>Prophets</hi> upon <hi>extraordinary messages,</hi> and then <hi>furnished</hi> them with <hi>sufficient evidence</hi> of their <hi>Divine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi> without being beholding to the <hi>Testimonials</hi> of the <hi>Schools</hi> of the <hi>Prophets.</hi> But besides these, <hi>God</hi> had a kind of <hi>Leiger-Prophets</hi> among his <hi>people;</hi> such were the most of those whom we read of in <hi>Scripture,</hi> which were no <hi>pen-men</hi> of the <hi>sacred Scripture;</hi> such in <hi>Davids</hi> time we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <hi>Gad</hi> and <hi>Nathan,</hi> and afterwards we read of many other <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Seers</hi> among them, to whom the people made their resort: Now these in probability were such as had been <hi>trained</hi> up in the <hi>Prophetick Schools,</hi> wherein the <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> did appear, but in a more <hi>fixed</hi> and <hi>setled</hi> way then in the <hi>extraordinary Prophets</hi> whom <hi>God</hi> did call out on some more <hi>signal</hi> occasions, such as <hi>Isaiah</hi> and <hi>Ieremiah</hi> were. We have a clear foundation for such a <hi>distinction</hi> of <hi>Prophets</hi> in those words of <hi>Amos</hi> to <hi>Amaziah,</hi> Amos 7. 14, 15. <hi>I was no Prophet, neither was I a Prophets son; but I was a herdman, and a gatherer of Sycamore fruits: And the Lord took me as I followed the stock; and the Lord said unto me, Go prophecie to my people Israel.</hi> Some understand the first words. <hi>I was not a Prophet,</hi> that he was not born a <hi>Prophet</hi> as <hi>Ieremiah</hi> was, not designed and set apart to it from his <hi>mothers womb;</hi> but I rather think by his not being a <hi>Prophet,</hi> he means he was none of those <hi>resident Prophets</hi> in the <hi>Colledges</hi> or <hi>Schools</hi> of them, not any of those who had led a <hi>prophetick life,</hi> and withdrawn themselves from <hi>converse</hi> with the <hi>world;</hi> nor <hi>was I</hi> (saith he) <hi>the son of a Prophet,</hi> i. e. not <hi>brought up</hi> in <hi>discipleship</hi> under those <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> and thereby <hi>trained</hi> up in order to the <hi>prophetick fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.

it may seem that when the <hi>Divine Spirit</hi> did overshadow the <hi>understanding</hi> of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> yet it offered no <hi>violence</hi> to their <hi>faculties,</hi> but left them to the free <hi>determination</hi> of their own <hi>wills</hi> in the <hi>execution</hi> of their <hi>office;</hi> but this must be understood of a lower degree of <hi>prophecy;</hi> for at some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times their <hi>prophecyes</hi> were <hi>as fire in their bones,</hi> that they <note place="margin">Jer. 20. 9.</note> were never at any rest till they had <hi>discharged</hi> their <hi>office.</hi> But withall by the example of <hi>Ionas,</hi> we see, that though the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>prophecy</hi> like the <hi>fire</hi> on the <hi>Altar</hi> could only be <hi>kindled</hi> from <hi>heaven,</hi> yet it might be <hi>destroyed</hi> when it was not <hi>maintained</hi> with something to feed upon; or when it met not with suitable entertainment from the <hi>spirits</hi> of those it fell upon, it might <hi>retreat</hi> back again to heaven, or at least lie hid in the <hi>embers</hi> till a <hi>new blast</hi> from the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> doth <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:53276:106"/>
unto them; but this <hi>Prophet</hi> could have no such <hi>certainty</hi> of the <hi>Divine revelation</hi> which was made to <hi>another,</hi> especially when it came <hi>immediately</hi> to <hi>contradict</hi> that which was so specially enjoyned him. 2.

He might have just <hi>cause</hi> to <hi>question</hi> the <hi>integrity</hi> of the <hi>old Prophet,</hi> both because of his <hi>living</hi> in <hi>Bethel,</hi> and not openly, according to his <hi>office, reproving</hi> their <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and that <hi>God</hi> should send him out of <hi>Iudea</hi> upon that very errand, which would not have seemed so probable, if there had been <hi>true Prophets resident</hi> upon the <hi>place.</hi> 4. The <hi>thing</hi> he desired him to <hi>do</hi> was not an <hi>act</hi> of that <hi>weight</hi> and <hi>importance</hi> on which <hi>God</hi> useth to send his <hi>Word</hi> to any <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> much less by one <hi>Prophet</hi> to contradict what he had said by another, and therefore <hi>Tertullian</hi> saith of him, <hi>poenam deserti jejunii luit, God</hi> punished him for <hi>breaking</hi> his <note place="margin">

                  <hi>fast</hi> at <hi>Bethel;</hi> and therefore that message of this <hi>Prophet</hi> seemed to <hi>gratifie</hi> more mans <hi>carnal appetite,</hi> then usually the <hi>actions</hi> of <hi>Prophets</hi> did, which were most times matters of <hi>hardship</hi> and <hi>uneasiness</hi> to the <hi>flesh.</hi> 5. However all these were, yet he <hi>yeilded</hi> too <hi>soon,</hi> especially having so much <hi>reason</hi> on his <hi>side</hi> as he had, being well <hi>assured</hi> that <hi>God</hi> had commanded him, he had reason to see some clear <hi>evidence</hi> of a <hi>countermand,</hi> before he altered his mind: if he had seen any thing upon tryal which might have <hi>staggerd</hi> his <hi>faith,</hi> he ought to have made his immediate <hi>recourse</hi> to <hi>God</hi> by <hi>prayer</hi> for the settlement of his <hi>mind</hi> and removal of this great <hi>temptation.</hi> But so easily to hearken to the <hi>words</hi> of a <hi>lying Prophet,</hi> which <hi>contradicted</hi> his own <hi>message,</hi> argued either great <hi>unbelief</hi> as to his own <hi>commission,</hi> or too great <hi>easiness</hi> and <hi>inadvertency</hi> in being drawn aside by the <hi>old Prophet.</hi> And therefore God made that <hi>old Prophet</hi> himself in the <hi>midst</hi> of his <hi>entertainment,</hi> as with a <hi>hand writing</hi>

                  <hi>When a Prophet speaketh in the name of the Lord, if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which the Lord hath not spoken, but the Prophet hath spoken it presumptuously; thou shalt not be afraid of him.

               <p n="1">1. <hi>That the events which are foretold, must be such as do exceed the reach of any created intellect;</hi> for otherwise it could be no evidence of a <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>true Prophecy;</hi> so that the <hi>foretelling</hi> of such <hi>events</hi> as <hi>depend</hi> upon a <hi>series</hi> of <hi>natural causes,</hi> or such as though they are out of the <hi>reach</hi> of <hi>humane understanding,</hi> yet are not of the <hi>Diabolical,</hi> or such <hi>things</hi> as <hi>fall</hi> out <hi>casually</hi> true, but by no <hi>certain grounds</hi> of <hi>prediction,</hi> can none of them be any argument of a <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Prophecy.</hi>

to <hi>ours,</hi> as the <hi>Prophecie</hi> of the <hi>Incarnation of Christ;</hi> the <hi>Prophecie</hi> of <hi>Praescience</hi> is of such things as <hi>depend</hi> upon the <hi>liberty</hi> of <hi>mans will;</hi> and the <hi>Prophecie</hi> of <hi>Commination</hi> only denotes <hi>Gods denunciations</hi> of <hi>heavy judgements</hi> against a people. But <hi>Aquinas</hi> doth better <hi>reduce</hi> the <hi>two former</hi> to <hi>one,</hi> and so the <hi>ground</hi> of the <hi>difference</hi> is to be fetched from the <hi>different ways</hi> whereby <hi>God</hi> knows <hi>things</hi> in the <hi>world;</hi> which is either as they are in <hi>their causes,</hi> and so they <hi>note</hi> the <hi>order</hi> and <hi>series</hi> of <hi>things</hi> in the world, with the <hi>mutual respects</hi> and <hi>dependencies</hi> they have one upon <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and this <hi>refers</hi> to <hi>Gods administration</hi> of <hi>things</hi> in the <hi>world;</hi> or else <hi>God</hi> looks upon them as they are <hi>in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi> or according to his own <hi>positive determinations</hi> of them; and now in this <hi>sense</hi> they are <hi>unalterable;</hi> but in the other they are not; but <hi>God</hi> may alter those <hi>respects</hi> of <hi>things</hi> when he pleaseth.

The possibility in general of a repeal of a Divine Law asserted; the particular case of the Law of</hi> Moses <hi>disputed against the Iews: the matter of that Law proved not to be immutably obligatory; because the ceremonial precepts were required not for themselves, but for some further end; that proved from</hi> Maimonides <hi>his confession: the precepts of the Ceremonial Law frequently dispensed with while the Law was in force. Of the Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over of</hi> Hezekiah, <hi>and several other instances.

Of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions seeming to imply the perpetuity of the Law of</hi> Moses. <hi>Reasons assigned why those expressions are used, though perpetuity be not implyed. The Law of</hi> Moses <hi>not built upon immutable reason, because many particular pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts were founded upon particular occasions, as the customs of the</hi> Zabii; <hi>many ceremonial precepts thence deduced out of</hi> Maimonides; <hi>and because such a state of things was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, with which the observation of the Ceremonial Law would be inconsistent.

                  <hi>the</hi> Jews, <hi>as sacrifices and oblations, were secundum intentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem secundam Dei, Gods secondary intention and design; but prayer, invocation, and the like, were nearer Gods primary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention: Now,</hi> saith he, <hi>for the first, they are no further ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God, then as all the circumstances of time, place, and persons are observed, which are prescribed by God himself; but the latter are acceptable in any person, time, or place. And for this cause,</hi> saith he, <hi>it is that we find the Prophets often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving men for their too great sedulity in bringing oblations, and inculcating this to them, that God did not intend these as the principal instances of his worship, and that God did not need any of these things.</hi> So 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 22. <hi>Behold to obey is better then sacrifice, and to hearken, then the fat of rams:</hi> Isa. 1. 11. <hi>To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the Lord.</hi> And especially <hi>Ierem.</hi> 7. 22, 23. <hi>For I spake not to your Fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them forth out of the Land of Aegypt, concerning</hi>

                  <hi>burnt-offerings; but this thing I commanded them, saying. Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and ye shall be my people.</hi> Of which words <hi>Maimonides</hi> saith, <hi>Scrupulum moverunt omnibus, quos mihi videre aut audire contigit;</hi> For say they, how can it be that <hi>God</hi> did not commandthem <hi>concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sacrifices,</hi> when great <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> is about them? But <hi>Maimonides</hi> well resolves the <hi>doubt</hi> thus, <hi>That Gods prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry intention, and that which he chiefly looked at was obedience; but Gods intention in sacrifices and oblations, was only to teach them the chief thing, which was obedience.</hi> This then is of the number of those things which are spoken <hi>absolutely,</hi> but to be understood <hi>comparatively,</hi> as, <hi>I will have mercy and not sacrifice.

First, <hi>That these precepts to which these expressions are annexed, should not be looked on as meer ambulatory Laws that did only concern them in their travels through the wilderness, and not continue obligatory when they were setled in Canaan.</hi> For which purpose we are to observe, that though all the <hi>Laws</hi> were given in one <hi>body</hi> in the <hi>wilderness,</hi> yet the <hi>obligation</hi> to <hi>all</hi> of <hi>them</hi> did not <hi>commence</hi> at the same <hi>time,</hi> neither were they to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue</hi> for the <hi>same duration;</hi> these three sorts of <hi>precepts</hi> may be <hi>observed</hi> among them; first such as <hi>concerned</hi> them <hi>only</hi> in their <hi>present condition,</hi> as that about the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> which was then a <hi>moveable Temple</hi> among them, <hi>suitable</hi> to their <hi>condition;</hi> but when they were setled, <hi>God</hi> was to have a setled <hi>house</hi> too. So that <hi>precept</hi> of going without <hi>the camp,</hi> Deut. 23. 12. had an immediate <hi>respect</hi> to their <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regrination. Secondly,</hi> such <hi>precepts</hi> as were given them, but they were not <hi>bound</hi> to <hi>perform</hi> them till their <hi>setlement</hi> in <hi>Canaan, as driving out the Canaanites,</hi> Numb. 33. 52.

                  <hi>building the Temple in the place which God should choose, erecting judicatories in their several Cities, choosing a King,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> there were such <hi>precepts</hi> as concern them where <hi>ever</hi> they were, whether in the <hi>wilderness</hi> or in <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an;</hi> now these are the <hi>precepts</hi> which are said to be <hi>perpetual.</hi> This is the account given of it by <hi>H.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> should be added to such <hi>things</hi> which were to <hi>continue</hi> till so <hi>great</hi> an <hi>alteration</hi> as should be on the <hi>coming</hi> of the <hi>Messias,</hi> especially if the <hi>coming</hi> of the <hi>Messias</hi> had been <hi>deferd</hi> so long as they falsly suppose it to be?

is, in such <hi>Laws</hi> which depend meerly upon <hi>Gods positive</hi> and <hi>arbitrary will.</hi> For in this <hi>case God</hi> allows <hi>none</hi> to <hi>alter</hi> any thing concerning his <hi>Laws;</hi> but <hi>indispensable obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> is our <hi>duty</hi> till <hi>God</hi> himself <hi>repeal</hi> his <hi>former Laws.</hi> And this we <hi>assert</hi> to be the <hi>case</hi> in the <hi>Gospel.</hi> So that it appears plainly that it implyes nothing <hi>inconsistent</hi> with the <hi>wisdom</hi> of <hi>God</hi> to <hi>repeal</hi> an <hi>established positive Law,</hi> though some <hi>expressions</hi> to <hi>prejudiced minds</hi> seem to imply a <hi>perpetuity</hi> in it.</p>

                     <hi>The great prejudice against our Saviour among Iews and Heathens, was the means of his appearance. The difference of the miracles at the delivery of the Law and Gospel. Some general Hypotheses to clear the subserviency of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles to the Doctrine of Christ.</hi> 1. <hi>That where the truth of a doctrine depends not on evidence, but authority, the only way to prove the truth of the Doctrine, is to prove the Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the revealer to be infallible. Things may be true which depend not on evidence of the things. What that is, and on what it depends. The uncertainty of natural knowledge. The existence of God, the foundation of all certainty. The cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of matters of faith proved from the same principle. Our knowladge of any thing supposeth something incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible. The certainty of faith as great as that of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; the grounds of it stronger. The consistency of rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal evidence with faith. Yet objects of faith exceed reason; the absurdities following the contrary opinion. The uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of that which is called reason. Philosophical dictates no standard of reason. Of transubstantiation and ubiquity &amp;c. why rejected as contrary to reason. The foundation of faith in matters above reason. Which is infallible Testimony that there are ways to know which is infallible, proved:</hi> 2. <hi>Hypoth. A Divine Testimony the most infallible. The resolution of faith into Gods veracity as its formal object.</hi> 3. <hi>Hypoth. A Divine Testimony may be known, though God speak not immediatly. Of Inspiration among the Iews and Divination among the Heathens.</hi> 4. <hi>Hyp. The eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of a Divine Testimony must be clear and certain. Of the common motives of faith, and the obligation to faith ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing from them. The original of Infidelity.</hi>

The repealing the Law of</hi> Moses, <hi>which had been setled by miracles. Why Christ checked the Pharisees for demanding a sign, when himself appeals to his miracles. The power of Christs mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles on many who did not throughly believe.

Of miracles wrought among Infidels. Of the future state of the Church. The necessity of the miracles of Christ, as to the propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christian Religion: that proved from the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the publishers, and the success of the Doctrine. The Apostles knew the hazard of their imployment, before they entred on it. The boldness and resolution of the Apostles not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding this, compared with heathen Philosophers. No motive could carry the Apostles through their imployment, but the truth of their Doctrine; not seeking the honour, profit or pleasure of the world. The Apostles evidence of the truth of their doctrine lay in being eye-witnesses of our Saviours miracles and resurrection. That attested by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; their sufficiency thence for preaching the Gospel. Of the nature of the doctrine of the Gospel; contrariety of</hi>

                  <hi>certainty</hi> of the <hi>doctrine</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> was this, that the <hi>doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Gospel</hi> was at first <hi>delivered</hi> to the <hi>world,</hi> by those <hi>persons</hi> who were themselves <hi>eye-witnesses</hi> of all the <hi>miracles</hi> which our <hi>Saviour</hi> wrought in <hi>confirmation</hi> of the <hi>truth</hi> of what he <hi>spake.</hi> They were such <hi>persons</hi> who had been them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves <hi>present,</hi> not only to hear <hi>most</hi> of our <hi>Saviours</hi> admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>discourses</hi> when he was in the <hi>world,</hi> but to see all those <hi>glorious things</hi> which were <hi>done</hi> by him, to make it <hi>appear</hi> that he was <hi>immediately</hi> sent from <hi>God.</hi> Let us now <hi>appeal</hi> to our own <hi>faculties,</hi> and <hi>examine</hi> a little what <hi>rational evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> could <hi>possibly</hi> be desired, that the <hi>doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Gospel</hi> was <hi>true,</hi> which <hi>God</hi> did not afford to the world?

                  <p>
                     <hi>The unreasonableness of rejecting the evidence from miracles, because of impostures. That there are certain rules of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishing true miracles from false, and Divine from dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical, proved from Gods intention in giving a power of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and the providence of God in the world. The incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of taking away the rational grounds of faith and placing it on self-evidence. Of the self-evidence of the Scriptures, and the insufficiency of that for resolving the question about the authority of the Scriptures. Of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended miracles of Impostors and false Christs, as</hi> Barcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelas David <hi>el-</hi>David <hi>and others. The rules whereby to judge true miracles from false.</hi> 1. <hi>True Divine miracles are wrought to confirm a Divine testimony. No miracles necessary for the certain conveyance of a Divine testimony: proved from the evidences that the Scriptures could not be corrupted.</hi> 2. <hi>No miracles Divine which contradict Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine revelation. Of Popish miracles.</hi> 3. <hi>Divine miracles leave Divine effects on those who believe them. Of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of</hi> Simon Magus. 4. <hi>Divine miracles tend to the overthrow of the devils power in the world: the antipathy of the doctrine of Christ to the devils designs in the world.</hi> 5. <hi>The distinction of true miracles from others, from the circumstances and manner of their operation. The miracles of Christ compared with those of the Heathen Gods.</hi> 6. <hi>God makes it evident to all impartial judgements that Divine miracles exceed created power. This manifested from the unparalleld miracles of</hi> Moses <hi>and our Saviour. From all which the rational evidence of Divine revelation is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested, as to the persons whom God imployes to teach the world.</hi>

But if we can make it appear, that, unless men through <hi>weakness</hi> of <hi>judgement</hi> or <hi>incogitancy</hi> deceive themselves, they may have certain <hi>evidence</hi> of the <hi>truth</hi> of <hi>miracles,</hi> then there can be nothing wanting as to the <hi>establishment</hi> of their <hi>minds</hi> in the <hi>truth</hi> of that <hi>doctrine</hi> which is confirmed by them. There hath been nothing which hath made men of better <hi>affections</hi> then <hi>understandings,</hi> so ready to suspect the <hi>strength</hi> of the <hi>evidence</hi> from <hi>miracles</hi> concerning <hi>Divine testimony,</hi> as the multitude of <hi>impostures</hi> in the <hi>world</hi> under the <hi>name</hi> of <hi>mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> and that the <hi>Scripture</hi> its self tells us we must not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to such as come with <hi>lying wonders.</hi> But may we not therefore safely rely on such <hi>miracles</hi> which we have certain <hi>evidence</hi> could not be wrought but by <hi>Divine power,</hi> because forsooth the <hi>Devil</hi> may sometimes <hi>abuse</hi> the <hi>ignorance</hi> and <hi>credulity</hi> of unwary men? or is it because the <hi>Scripture</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids us to <hi>believe</hi> such as should come with a <hi>pretence</hi> of <hi>miracles,</hi> therefore we cannot rely on the <hi>miracles</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> himself? which is as much as to say, because the <hi>Scripture</hi> tells us that we must not believe <hi>every spirit,</hi> therefore we must believe <hi>none</hi> at all; or because we must not entertain any <hi>other doctrine</hi> besides the <hi>Gospel,</hi> therefore we have no <hi>reason</hi> to believe that. For the <hi>ground</hi> whereby we are assured by the <hi>Scriptures</hi> that the <hi>testimony</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> was <hi>Divine,</hi> and therefore his <hi>doctrine true,</hi> is, because it was <hi>confirmed</hi> by such <hi>miracles</hi> as he did; now if that <hi>argument</hi> were <hi>insufficient</hi> which the <hi>Scriptures</hi> tell us was the great <hi>evidence</hi> of <hi>Christs</hi> being <hi>sent from God,</hi> we cannot give our selves a sufficient <hi>account</hi> in point of <hi>evidence</hi> on which we believe the <hi>doctrine</hi>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>From Gods intention in giving to any this power of doing miracles.</hi> We have largely made it manifest that the end of true <hi>miracles</hi> is to be a <hi>confirmation</hi> to the <hi>world</hi> of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine commission</hi> of the <hi>persons</hi> who have it, and that the <hi>testimony</hi> is <hi>Divine</hi> which is confirmed by it.

matter, and some <hi>objective reality</hi> must be supposed in order to the <hi>intellectual conception</hi> of these <hi>Anomalous entityes.</hi> By which we see that that strange kind of <hi>omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency</hi> which some have attributed to the <hi>understanding,</hi> lies not in a <hi>power</hi> of conceiving things wholly <hi>impossible,</hi> or fancying <hi>Idea's</hi> of absolute <hi>non-entityes,</hi> but in a kind of <hi>African copulation</hi> of such <hi>species</hi> of things together, which in <hi>nature</hi> seem wholly <hi>incompossible,</hi> (as the <hi>Schools</hi> speak) or have no <hi>congruity</hi> at all in the <hi>order</hi> of the <hi>universe.</hi> So that had there never been any such <hi>things</hi> in the world as <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>motion,</hi> it is very hard to conceive, how the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding</hi> could have formed within its self the <hi>variety</hi> of the <hi>species</hi> of such things, which are the <hi>results</hi> of those two grand <hi>principles</hi> of the <hi>Universe.</hi> But because it is so <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible</hi> for minds not very <hi>contemplative</hi> and <hi>Metaphysical</hi> to <hi>abstract</hi> from <hi>matter,</hi> thence it is we are apt to <hi>imagine</hi> such a <hi>power</hi> in the <hi>understanding,</hi> whereby it may form <hi>Idea's</hi> of such things which have no <hi>objective reality</hi> at all. I grant those we call <hi>entia rationis</hi> have no <hi>external reality</hi> as they are <hi>such;</hi> but yet I say, the <hi>existence</hi> of <hi>matter</hi> in the <hi>world,</hi> and the <hi>corporeal phantasmes</hi> of <hi>outward beings,</hi> are the <hi>foundation</hi> of the <hi>souls conception</hi> of those <hi>entityes,</hi> which have no <hi>existence</hi> beyond the <hi>humane Intellect.</hi>

hath? which I suppose <hi>none,</hi> who have a minde within them can question.

Now then is it not possible for a mans <hi>mind,</hi> proceeding in its ordinary way of <hi>intellection,</hi> to <hi>form</hi> a <hi>notion</hi> of such a <hi>Being,</hi> which hath <hi>wisdom, goodness</hi> and <hi>power</hi> in it, without any <hi>limits</hi> and <hi>bounds</hi> at all, or any of those <hi>abatements</hi> which any of these <hi>perfections</hi> are found with in <hi>man?</hi> For it is unconceivable, that the <hi>mind</hi> of <hi>man</hi> can <hi>attribute</hi> to its self <hi>absolute perfection,</hi> when it cannot but see its own <hi>defects</hi> in those <hi>things</hi> it excells other <hi>creatures</hi> in; and supposing it had <hi>power, goodness,</hi> and <hi>knowledge</hi> far above what it hath; yet it cannot but say, that these <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi> would be greater if it were <hi>alwayes</hi> possessed of them, and it were <hi>impossible</hi> that it should ever cease to be, or not have been. So that now joyning <hi>infinite goodness, wisdom</hi> and <hi>power,</hi> with <hi>eternity</hi> and <hi>necessity</hi> of <hi>existence,</hi> the <hi>result</hi> is the notion of a <hi>Being absolutely perfect.</hi> So that now who ever questions the <hi>suitableness</hi> of such a <hi>notion</hi> or <hi>Idea</hi> to the <hi>faculties</hi> of mens <hi>souls,</hi> must question the <hi>truth</hi> of his own <hi>faculties,</hi> and the <hi>method</hi> they proceed in, in their clearest <hi>conceptions</hi> and <hi>ratioeinations.</hi> And the <hi>mind</hi> of <hi>man</hi> may as well question the <hi>truth</hi> of any <hi>Idea</hi> it hath within its self, as of this we now discourse of.

                  <hi>perfect Being,</hi> be any thing else but the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings <hi>Plastick power,</hi> whereby it can <hi>unite</hi> all these <hi>perfections</hi> together in one <hi>conception,</hi> or doth it necessarily imply, that there must be such a <hi>Being</hi> really <hi>existent,</hi> or else I could never have formed such a setled <hi>notion</hi> of him in my mind? To this I answer, 1. It is as much as I desire at present, that the <hi>forming</hi> of such an <hi>Idea</hi> in the <hi>mind,</hi> is as <hi>suitable</hi> and <hi>agreeable</hi> to our <hi>faculties,</hi> as the <hi>forming</hi> the <hi>conception</hi> of any other <hi>Being</hi> in the <hi>world.</hi> For hereby it is most evident, that the <hi>notion</hi> of a <hi>God</hi> imports nothing <hi>incongruous</hi> to <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> or <hi>repugnant</hi> to the <hi>faculties</hi> of our <hi>souls;</hi> but that the <hi>mind</hi> will <hi>form</hi> as setled and clear a <hi>notion</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> as of any thing which in the judgement of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> his infallible <hi>senses</hi> did the most assure him of. So that there can be no shadow of a <hi>pretence,</hi> why any should reject the <hi>Being</hi> of a <hi>God,</hi> because of the <hi>impossibility</hi> to conceive any such <hi>Being</hi> as <hi>God</hi> is. If to this it be objected, <hi>that such things are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in this Idea, which make it unconceivable, in that all the perfections in this Being are supposed to be infinite, and infinity transcends our capacity of apprehension.</hi> To this I answer, 1. That those who deny <hi>infinity</hi> in <hi>God,</hi> must necessarily at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute it to something else, as to <hi>infinite space, infinity</hi> of <hi>successions</hi> of <hi>ages</hi> and <hi>persons,</hi> if the <hi>world</hi> were <hi>eternal;</hi> and therefore it is most <hi>unreasonable</hi> to reject any <hi>notion</hi> for that, which it is <hi>impossible,</hi> but if I deny that, I must attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute it to some thing else, to whose <hi>Idea</hi> it is far less proper then it is to <hi>Gods.</hi> 2. Least I should rather seek to avoid the <hi>argument</hi> then to satisfie it, I say, that though <hi>infinite</hi> as <hi>infinite</hi> cannot be comprehended, yet we may <hi>clearly</hi> and <hi>distinctly</hi> apprehend a <hi>Being</hi> to be of that <hi>nature,</hi> that no <hi>limits</hi> can be <hi>assigned</hi> to it, as to its <hi>power</hi> or <hi>presence;</hi> which is as much as to understand it to be <hi>infinite.</hi> The <hi>ratio formalis</hi> of <hi>infinity</hi> may not be understood clearly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly, but yet the <hi>Being</hi> which is <hi>infinite</hi> may be. <hi>Infinity</hi> its self cannot be on this account, because how ever <hi>positive</hi> we apprehend it, yet we alwayes apprehend it in a <hi>negative way,</hi> because we conceive it by <hi>denying</hi> all <hi>limitations</hi> and
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:53276:208"/>
                  <hi>bounds</hi> to it; but the <hi>Being</hi> which is <hi>infinite</hi> we apprehend in a <hi>positive manner,</hi> although not <hi>adaequately,</hi> because we cannot comprehend all which is in it. As we may clearly and distinctly see the <hi>Sea,</hi> though we cannot <hi>discover</hi> the <hi>bounds</hi> of it; so may we clearly and distinctly <hi>apprehend</hi> some <hi>perfections</hi> of <hi>God</hi> when we <hi>fix</hi> our minds on them, although we are not able to <hi>grasp</hi> them all together in our <hi>narrow</hi> and <hi>confined intellects,</hi> because they are <hi>Infinite.</hi> Thus we see that <hi>Gods Infinity</hi> doth not at all abate the <hi>clearness</hi> and <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctness</hi> of the <hi>notion</hi> which we have of <hi>God;</hi> so that though the <hi>perfections</hi> of <hi>God</hi> are without <hi>bounds</hi> or <hi>limits,</hi> yet it bears no <hi>repugnancy</hi> at all to mens natural <hi>faculties</hi> to have a settled <hi>Idea</hi> of a <hi>Being Infinitely perfect</hi> in their minds.</p>
               <p>To the <hi>Question</hi> I answer, It seems highly <hi>probable</hi> and far more <hi>consonant</hi> to <hi>reason</hi> then the <hi>contrary,</hi> that this <hi>Idea</hi> of <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 6.</note> 
                  <hi>God</hi> upon the <hi>mind</hi> of man, is no meerly <hi>fictitious Idea,</hi> but that it is really <hi>imprinted</hi> there by that <hi>God</hi> whose <hi>Idea</hi> it is, and therefore doth suppose a <hi>reality</hi> in the thing correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to that <hi>objective reality</hi> which is in the understanding. For although I am not so well satisfied that the meer <hi>objective reality</hi> of the <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>God</hi> doth exceed the <hi>efficiency</hi> of the mind, as that <hi>Idea</hi> is nakedly considered in its self, because of the unlimited <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>understanding</hi> in <hi>conception:</hi> Yet I say, considering that <hi>Idea</hi> in all the <hi>circumstances</hi> of it, it seems highly <hi>probable</hi> that it is no meer <hi>ens rationis,</hi> or <hi>fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of the <hi>understanding;</hi> and that will appear on these considerations. 1. This <hi>Idea</hi> is of such a <hi>nature</hi> as could not be <hi>formed</hi> from the <hi>understandings consideration</hi> of any <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal phantasms.</hi> Because whatever hath any thing of <hi>matter</hi> in it, involves of <hi>necessity</hi> many <hi>imperfections</hi> along with it; for every part of <hi>matter</hi> is <hi>divisible</hi> into more <hi>parts.</hi> Now it is a thing evident to <hi>natural light,</hi> that it is a greater <hi>perfection</hi> not to be <hi>divisible</hi> then to be so. Besides, <hi>corporeal phantasms</hi> are so far from helping us. in forming this <hi>Idea,</hi> that they alone hinder us from a <hi>distinct conception</hi> of it, while we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to them; because these bear no <hi>proportion</hi> at all to such a <hi>being.</hi> So that this <hi>Idea</hi> however must be a pure <hi>act</hi> of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellection,</hi> and therefore supposing there were no other <hi>facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
                  <pb n="373" facs="tcp:53276:208"/>
in man but <hi>imagination,</hi> it would bear the greatest <hi>repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy</hi> to our <hi>conceptions,</hi> and it would be according to the <hi>principles</hi> of <hi>Epicurus</hi> and some modern <hi>Philosophers,</hi> a thing wholly <hi>impossible</hi> to form an <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> unless with <hi>Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> we imagine him to be <hi>corporeal,</hi> which is to say he is no <hi>God.</hi> Which was the reason that <hi>Tully</hi> said <hi>Epicurus</hi> did on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>nomine poncre, re tollere Deos,</hi> because such a notion of <hi>God</hi> is repugnant to natural light. So that if this <hi>Idea</hi> doth wholly abstract from <hi>corporeal phantasms,</hi> it thereby appears that there is a higher <hi>faculty</hi> in mans <hi>soul</hi> then meer <hi>imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> and it is hardly conceivable whence a <hi>faculty</hi> which thus extends its self to an <hi>infinite object,</hi> should come but from an <hi>infinite Being:</hi> especially if we consider, 2. That the <hi>understanding</hi> in <hi>forming</hi> this <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> doth not by distinct <hi>acts,</hi> first collect one <hi>perfection,</hi> and then <hi>another,</hi> and at last <hi>unite</hi> these <hi>together,</hi> but the <hi>simplicity</hi> and <hi>unity</hi> of all these <hi>perfections</hi> is as necessarily conceived as any of them. Granting then that the understanding by the observing of several <hi>perfections</hi> in the world, might be able to <hi>abstract</hi> these severally from each <hi>being</hi> wherein they were, yet whence should the <hi>Idea</hi> of the <hi>unity</hi> and <hi>inseparability</hi> of all these <hi>perfections</hi> come? The mind may, it is true, knit some <hi>things</hi> together in <hi>fictitious Idea's,</hi> but then those are so far from <hi>unity</hi> with each other, that in themselves they speak mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual <hi>repugnancy</hi> to one another, which makes them proper <hi>entia rationis;</hi> but these several <hi>perfections</hi> are so far from speaking <hi>repugnancy</hi> to each other, that the <hi>unity</hi> and <hi>insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rability</hi> of them is as necessary to the <hi>forming</hi> of this <hi>Idea,</hi> as any other <hi>perfection</hi> whatsoever. So that from hence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that the consideration of the <hi>perfections</hi> which are in the <hi>creatures,</hi> is only an <hi>occasion</hi> given to the <hi>mind</hi> to help it in its <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and not that the <hi>Idea</hi> its self depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on those <hi>perfections</hi> as the <hi>causes</hi> of it; as in the clearest <hi>Mathematical truths</hi> the manner of <hi>demonstration</hi> may be necessary to help the understanding to its clearer <hi>assent,</hi> though the things in themselves be undoubtedly <hi>true.</hi> For all minds are not equally capable of the same <hi>truths;</hi> some are of quicker <hi>apprehension</hi> then others are; now although to slower apprehensions a more particular way of <hi>demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strating</hi>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>That they assert some things on far less reason then we do that there is a God.</hi> For if there be not an <hi>infinitely powerful God</hi> who produced the world out of nothing, it must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily follow according to the different <hi>principles</hi> of the <hi>Aristotelian</hi> and <hi>Epicurean Atheists,</hi> that either the <hi>world</hi> was as it is from all <hi>eternity,</hi> or else that it was at first made by the <hi>fortuitous concourse</hi> of <hi>Atoms.</hi> Now I appeal to the <hi>reason</hi> of any <hi>person</hi> who hath the free <hi>use</hi> of it, Whether either of these two <hi>Hypotheses,</hi> urged with the same or great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er difficulties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be not far more weakly proved, then the <hi>existence</hi> of a <hi>Deity</hi> is, or the <hi>production</hi> of the <hi>world</hi> by him.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>They run themselves into the same difficulties</hi> which they would avoid in the <hi>belief</hi> of a <hi>Deity;</hi> and nothing can be a greater <hi>evidence</hi> of an <hi>intangled</hi> mind then this is: To deny a thing because of some <hi>difficulty</hi> in it, and instead of it to assert another <hi>thing</hi> which is <hi>chargeable</hi> with the very same <hi>difficulty</hi> in a higher degree. Thus when they <hi>reject</hi> a <hi>Deity,</hi>
                  <pb n="376" facs="tcp:53276:210"/>
because they cannot understand what <hi>infinity</hi> means; both these <hi>Hypotheses</hi> are lyable to the same <hi>intricacy</hi> in <hi>appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending</hi> the nature of something <hi>Infinite.</hi> For according to the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> there must be an <hi>Infinite space,</hi> and what greater ease to the mind is there in <hi>conceiving</hi> an <hi>Idea</hi> of that then of an <hi>Infinite Being.</hi> And if the <hi>world</hi> be <hi>eternal,</hi> there must have been past an <hi>Infinite succession</hi> of <hi>ages,</hi> and is not the <hi>understanding</hi> as easily lost in this, as in an <hi>eternal Being</hi> which created the world? For if the <hi>course</hi> of <hi>Generations</hi> in the world had no <hi>beginning</hi> at all, (which necessarily follows upon the <hi>eternity</hi> of the <hi>world)</hi> then an <hi>infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> of <hi>successions</hi> are already <hi>past,</hi> and if <hi>past</hi> then at an <hi>end,</hi> and so we find an <hi>Infinite</hi> which hath had an <hi>end,</hi> which is a <hi>consequence</hi> becoming one who avoids the <hi>belief</hi> of a <hi>Deity,</hi> because <hi>Infinity</hi> is an <hi>unconceivable</hi> thing. Besides if the <hi>number</hi> of <hi>Generations</hi> hath been <hi>Infinite,</hi> these two <hi>consequences</hi> will unavoidably follow, which the <hi>reason</hi> of any one but an <hi>Atheist</hi> would <hi>startle</hi> at, that one <hi>Infinite</hi> may be <hi>greater</hi> then <hi>another,</hi> and that the <hi>part</hi> is <hi>equal</hi> to the <hi>whole.</hi> For let him fix where he please in the <hi>course</hi> of <hi>Generations,</hi> I demand whether in the <hi>Great-grand-fathers</hi> time the <hi>succession</hi> of <hi>Generations</hi> was <hi>finite</hi> or <hi>Infinite;</hi> if <hi>finite,</hi> then it had a <hi>beginning;</hi> and so the <hi>world</hi> not <hi>eternal;</hi> if <hi>infinite,</hi> then I ask, Whether there were not a longer <hi>suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession</hi> of <hi>Generations</hi> in the <hi>time</hi> of his <hi>great grand-children,</hi> and so there must be a <hi>number</hi> greater then that which was <hi>infinite;</hi> for the former <hi>succession</hi> was infinite, and this hath more <hi>Generations</hi> in it then <hi>that</hi> had; but if it be said that they were <hi>equal,</hi> because both <hi>infinite,</hi> then the <hi>succession</hi> of <hi>Generations</hi> to the <hi>Grand-father,</hi> being but a <hi>part</hi> of that which <hi>extends</hi> to his <hi>grand-children</hi> and <hi>posterity,</hi> the <hi>part</hi> is <hi>equal</hi> to the <hi>whole.</hi> And is not now the notion of an <hi>Infinite Being</hi> enough to stumble an <hi>Atheists</hi> reason, when it can so nimbly <hi>leap</hi> over so apparent contradictions? I insist not on this as an evident <hi>demonstration</hi> to prove a <hi>Deity,</hi> which pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly it may not amount to, because it may only <hi>demonstrate</hi> the <hi>impossibility</hi> of our <hi>understandings comprehending</hi> the nature of <hi>Infinity.</hi> But however it doth most evidently <hi>demonstrate</hi> the <hi>folly</hi> and <hi>unreasonableness</hi> of the <hi>Atheist</hi> who

3.

For in this case only an <hi>opportunity</hi> is <hi>watched</hi> for to <hi>shake</hi> off that which they account a <hi>yoke</hi> upon their <hi>necks;</hi> whereas when mens minds are possessed with a <hi>sense</hi> of <hi>duty</hi> and <hi>obligation</hi> to <hi>obedience</hi> out of <hi>conscience,</hi> the <hi>rains</hi> may be held with greater <hi>ease;</hi> and yet the <hi>people</hi> be better <hi>managed</hi> by them, then by such as only <hi>gall</hi> and <hi>inrage</hi> them. So that I grant <hi>true religion</hi> to be the most <hi>serviceable</hi> principle for the <hi>governing</hi> of civil <hi>societies;</hi> but withal I say, 2. It were <hi>impossible religion</hi> should be so much made <hi>use</hi> of for the <hi>governing</hi> of <hi>people,</hi> were there not a real <hi>propensity</hi> and <hi>incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> to <hi>religion imprinted</hi> on the <hi>minds</hi> of <hi>men.</hi> For as, did not men <hi>love themselves</hi> and their <hi>children,</hi> their <hi>estates</hi> and <hi>interests,</hi> it were <hi>impossible</hi> to keep <hi>them</hi> in <hi>obedience</hi> to <hi>Laws;</hi> but doth it follow, because <hi>Magistrates</hi> perswade <hi>people</hi> to <hi>obedience</hi> by suiting <hi>Laws</hi> to the general <hi>interest</hi> of men, that therefore the <hi>Magistrates</hi> first made them <hi>love themselves</hi> and their own <hi>concerns?</hi> So it is in <hi>religion,</hi> the <hi>Magistrate</hi> may make <hi>use</hi> of this <hi>propensity</hi> to <hi>religion</hi> in men for <hi>civil ends,</hi> but his making <hi>use</hi> of it doth <hi>suppose</hi> it and not <hi>instill</hi> it. For were <hi>religion</hi> nothing else in the <hi>world</hi> but a <hi>design</hi> only of <hi>Politicians,</hi> it would be <hi>impossible</hi> to keep that <hi>design</hi> from being <hi>discovered</hi> at one time or other, and when once it came to be <hi>known,</hi> it would <hi>hurry</hi> the whole <hi>world</hi> into <hi>confusion;</hi> and the <hi>people</hi> would make no <hi>scruple</hi> of all <hi>oaths</hi> and <hi>obligations,</hi> but every one would seek to do
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:53276:213"/>
others what mischief he could if he had <hi>opportunity,</hi> and <hi>obey</hi> no further then <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>force</hi> constrained him. Therefore no <hi>principle</hi> can be so <hi>dangerous</hi> to a <hi>state</hi> as <hi>Atheism,</hi> nor any thing more <hi>promote</hi> its <hi>peace</hi> then true <hi>religion;</hi> and the more <hi>men</hi> are <hi>perswaded</hi> of the <hi>truth</hi> of <hi>religion,</hi> they will be the better <hi>subjects,</hi> and the more <hi>useful</hi> in civil <hi>societies.</hi> As well then may an <hi>Atheist</hi> say there is no such <hi>thing</hi> as <hi>good nature</hi> in the world because that is apt to be <hi>abused,</hi> nor any such thing as <hi>love</hi> because that may be <hi>cheated,</hi> as that <hi>religion</hi> is nothing but a <hi>design,</hi> because men may make it <hi>stalke</hi> to their private ends. Thus we see how the <hi>Atheist by the force of those principles on which he denyes a God, must be forced to deny other things, which yet by his own confession are apparently true.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So I come to the third <hi>Proposition,</hi> which is, <hi>That we have</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That God hath imprinted an universal character of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self on the minds of men;</hi> and that may be known by two

things. 1. <hi>If it be such as bears the same importance among all persons.</hi> 2. <hi>If it be such as cannot be mistaken for the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of any thing else.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. I begin with the first, whereby I shall prove this <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter</hi> to be <hi>universal,</hi> because the whole <hi>world</hi> hath <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented</hi> in it. This <hi>argument</hi> we may rely on with the greater <hi>security,</hi> because it was the only <hi>argument</hi> which retained the <hi>Deity</hi> in the ancient <hi>School</hi> of <hi>Epicurus;</hi> which could he have thought of as easie way of <hi>evading</hi> it, as he thought he had found out as to the <hi>Origine</hi> of the <hi>universe,</hi> he was no such great <hi>friend</hi> to the very <hi>name</hi> of a <hi>God,</hi> as to have <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained</hi> it as an <hi>Anticipation</hi> or <hi>Prolepsis</hi> of <hi>humane nature.</hi> And this <hi>argument</hi> from the universal <hi>consent</hi> of the world, was that which bore the greatest <hi>sway</hi> among the <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,</hi> who went by <hi>nothing</hi> but <hi>dictates</hi> of <hi>natural light,</hi> which they could not so clearly discover in any <hi>things,</hi> as in those which all <hi>mankind</hi> did <hi>unanimously</hi> consent in. Two things I shall make out this by. 1. <hi>That no sufficient ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count can be given of so universal a consent, unless it be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be the voyce of nature.</hi> 2. <hi>That the dissent of any particular persons is not sufficient to controul so universal an agreement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That no sufficient account of it can be given, but only by asserting it to be a dictate of nature.</hi> In so strange a <hi>dissent</hi> as there hath been in the <hi>world</hi> concerning most of those things which relate to <hi>mankinde</hi> in common, as the <hi>models</hi> of <hi>government,</hi> the <hi>Laws</hi> they are ruled by, the particular <hi>rites</hi> and <hi>customs</hi> of <hi>worship;</hi> we have the greatest <hi>reason</hi> to <hi>judge</hi> that those <hi>common principles</hi> which were the <hi>foundations</hi> on which all these several different <hi>customs</hi> were <hi>built,</hi> were not the <hi>effect</hi> of any positive <hi>Laws,</hi> nor the meer <hi>force</hi> of <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> of <hi>education,</hi> but something which had a <hi>deeper root</hi> and <hi>foundation</hi> in the <hi>principles</hi> of <hi>nature</hi> its self. A <hi>common</hi> and <hi>universal effect</hi> must <hi>flow</hi> from some <hi>common</hi> and <hi>universal cause.</hi> So the <hi>Stoick</hi> argues in <hi>Tully,</hi> If there were no God, <note place="margin">

               <p>We see in all the <hi>alterations</hi> of the world, other vain opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions have been detected, refuted and shaken off; if this had been such, how comes it to remain the same in all ages and Nations of the world? <hi>Opinionum commenta delet dies, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae judicia confirmat.</hi> It is a great discredit to <hi>Time</hi> to make it like a river in that sense, that it <hi>bears</hi> up only <hi>lighter</hi> things, when matters of greatest <hi>weight</hi> are <hi>sunk</hi> to the <hi>bottom</hi> and past recovery; This may pass for a handsom allusion, as to the opinions and writings of particular persons, but cannot be understood of such <hi>things</hi> which are <hi>founded</hi> on the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal <hi>consent</hi> of the world; for these <hi>common notions</hi> of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature are so suited to the <hi>temper</hi> of the world, that they pass down the strong <hi>current</hi> of <hi>Time</hi> with the same facility that a well built ship, though of good burden, doth <hi>furrow</hi> the <hi>Ocean.</hi> So that if we must adhere to the <hi>Allegory,</hi> it is easily replyed, that it is not the <hi>weight</hi> of things which makes them <hi>sink,</hi> but the unsuitableness of their <hi>superficies</hi> to that of the water; so we see a small piece of wood will sink, when a stately ship is born up; so such <hi>things</hi> which have not that <hi>agreeableness</hi> in them to the <hi>dictates</hi> of <hi>nature</hi> may soon be lost, but such as lye so <hi>even</hi> upon the <hi>superficies</hi> of the <hi>soul,</hi> will still <hi>float</hi> above the <hi>water,</hi> and never be lost in the swiftest <hi>current</hi> of Time.

               <p>But now it is hardly conceivable, according to the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> how mankind should universally agree in <note place="margin">

And this is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evident in the vast difference of <hi>designs</hi> and <hi>interests</hi> which were carried on in the <hi>Heathen world</hi> upon this general ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of a <hi>Deity.</hi> How came the <hi>world</hi> to be so easily abused into <hi>Religions</hi> of all <hi>shapes</hi> and <hi>fashions,</hi> had not there been a <hi>natural inclination</hi> in mens <hi>souls</hi> to <hi>Religion,</hi> and an <hi>Indeleble Idea</hi> of a <hi>Deity</hi> on the <hi>minds</hi> of men?

to <hi>believe</hi> there was a <hi>God, did before, all believe there was none;</hi> and how can it possibly enter into the <hi>reason</hi> of any <hi>man</hi> to think, that <hi>people</hi> who had been brought up in the <hi>belief</hi> that there was no <hi>God</hi> at all, nor any <hi>state</hi> after this <hi>life,</hi> should all unanimously <hi>quit</hi> the <hi>principles</hi> of <hi>education</hi> which tended so much to their <hi>ease</hi> and <hi>pleasure</hi> here, to <hi>believe</hi> there was a <hi>God</hi> and another <hi>life,</hi> and thereby to fill them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves full of <hi>fears</hi> and <hi>disquietments;</hi> meerly because their <hi>Rulers</hi> told them so?

Did the <hi>designs</hi> of <hi>Governours</hi> and the <hi>credulity</hi> of all <hi>people</hi> fall out to be so <hi>suitable</hi> together?

yet whence should it come to <hi>pass</hi> that the <hi>world</hi> which is generally led more by the <hi>opinions</hi> of their <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers</hi> then by <hi>reason,</hi> should so <hi>cancell</hi> that former <hi>tradition</hi> that there was no <hi>God,</hi> that no remaining <hi>foot-steps</hi> of it can be traced in any history of those times?

It is manifest to our <hi>reason,</hi> that in all other <hi>beings</hi> which we apprehend the <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> of, nothing else can be <hi>implyed</hi> in the <hi>natures</hi> of them beyond bare <hi>possibility</hi> of <hi>existence;</hi> no, although the <hi>things</hi> which do apprehend, do <hi>really exist,</hi> because in forming an <hi>Idea</hi> of a thing, we abstract from every <hi>thing</hi> which is not implyed in the very <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>thing;</hi> now <hi>existence</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

only <hi>contingent</hi> and <hi>possible,</hi> as to any other <hi>being,</hi> it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be any <hi>ingredient</hi> of its <hi>Idea,</hi> because it doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to its <hi>essence;</hi> for we may fully <hi>apprehend</hi> the <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>thing,</hi> without attributing <hi>existence</hi> to it. But now in our <hi>conception</hi> of a <hi>Being absolutely perfect,</hi> bare <hi>possibility</hi> or <hi>contingency</hi> of <hi>existence</hi> speaks a direct <hi>repugnancy</hi> to the <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>kim;</hi> for how can we conceive that <hi>Being absolutely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi> which may want that which gives <hi>life</hi> to all other <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,</hi> which is <hi>existence?</hi> The only <hi>scruple,</hi> which mens minds are <hi>subject</hi> to in apprehending the <hi>force</hi> of this <hi>argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> lies in this, Whether this <hi>necessary existence doth really belong to the nature of that being whose Idea it is, or else it be only a Mode of our conception in apprehending God?</hi> For clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this, we must consider by what certain <hi>rules</hi> we can know when the <hi>composition of things</hi> together in the <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,</hi> doth <hi>depend</hi> upon the <hi>meer operation</hi> of the <hi>mind,</hi> and when they do <hi>belong</hi> to the things themselves and their <hi>immutable nature.</hi> For which we have no <hi>rule</hi> so <hi>certain</hi> and <hi>evident</hi> as this is, that in those <hi>things</hi> which depend <hi>meerly</hi> on the <hi>act</hi> of the <hi>mind</hi> joyning together, the <hi>understanding</hi> cannot only <hi>abstract</hi> one <hi>thing</hi> from <hi>another,</hi> but may really <hi>divide</hi> them in its <hi>conceptions</hi> from each other: but in such <hi>things</hi> which cannot be <hi>divided</hi> from each <hi>other,</hi> but the <hi>essence</hi> of the <hi>thing</hi> is <hi>quite</hi> altered, it is a certain <hi>evidence</hi> that those <hi>things</hi> were not <hi>conjoyned</hi> by the meer <hi>act</hi> of the <hi>mind,</hi> but do <hi>immutably belong</hi> to the <hi>natures</hi> of the <hi>things</hi> themselves. As for instance, when I conceive a <hi>Triangle</hi> inscribed in a <hi>square, a man walking,</hi> a <hi>horse with wings,</hi> it is evident I may <hi>understand</hi> the <hi>natures</hi> of all these <hi>things</hi> without these <hi>affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> of them, because I can fully <hi>apprehend</hi> the <hi>nature</hi> of a <hi>Triangle</hi> without imagining a <hi>square, a man</hi> without <hi>walking,</hi> a <hi>horse</hi> without <hi>wings;</hi> thence it necessarily follows, that the <hi>joyning</hi> of these <hi>things</hi> together was <hi>meerly</hi> an <hi>act</hi> of the <hi>mind;</hi> but now I cannot <hi>conceive</hi> a <hi>Triangle</hi> not to have <hi>three angles equal to two right ones,</hi> nor a <hi>man</hi> that hath not <hi>rationality</hi> belonging to him; for if I divide these <hi>attributes</hi> from them, I destroy their <hi>natures;</hi> and therefore the <hi>joyning</hi> of these together is not any meer <hi>act</hi> of the <hi>mind,</hi> but these are such <hi>things</hi> as are <hi>implyed</hi> in the very <hi>notion</hi> of them,
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:53276:222"/>
and therefore <hi>immutably</hi> belongs to them. So now, when I conceive the notion of a <hi>body,</hi> I can imagine all <hi>perfections belonging</hi> to it, without <hi>conceiving</hi> it <hi>necessarily</hi> to <hi>exist;</hi> for it may be a <hi>body</hi> still, though it hath not its <hi>being</hi> from its <hi>self;</hi> but when I conceive a <hi>Being absolutely perfect,</hi> it is <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible</hi> to imagine it should have its <hi>being</hi> from any <hi>other;</hi> and if it be from its <hi>self,</hi> it must of <hi>necessity exist.</hi> For though the <hi>mind</hi> still be <hi>apt</hi> to doubt, whether <hi>existence</hi> in this <hi>Idea</hi> be only a <hi>mode of cogitation;</hi> yet that doubt may be easily removed, if the <hi>mind</hi> doth but <hi>attend</hi> to this, that at least <hi>possibility</hi> of <hi>existence</hi> doth belong to all those <hi>Beings</hi> which we have a clear <hi>Idea</hi> of in our <hi>minds;</hi> and the reason why we attribute bare <hi>possibility</hi> to them, is because we apprehend some <hi>reason</hi> in our <hi>minds</hi> which keeps us from <hi>attributing necessity</hi> of <hi>existence</hi> to them, as that it is not <hi>implyed</hi> in its <hi>nature,</hi> or that it doth <hi>depend</hi> on some other <hi>being,</hi> or that it wants <hi>infinite power,</hi> &amp;c. Now all these <hi>reasons</hi> which make us <hi>attribute</hi> bare <hi>possibility</hi> of <hi>existence</hi> to any <hi>being,</hi> are taken away when we conceive a <hi>being absolutely perfect;</hi> for then <hi>existence</hi> is implyed among the <hi>number</hi> of <hi>perfections,</hi> and this <hi>being</hi> is <hi>dependent</hi> upon all others, and <hi>infinitely power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full;</hi> so that <hi>nothing</hi> can hinder its <hi>existence;</hi> and therefore we must <hi>conclude</hi> that <hi>necessity</hi> of <hi>existence</hi> doth immutably belong to the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>notion</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and is not any <hi>mode</hi> only of our <hi>conception;</hi> because if we take away <hi>necessity</hi> of <hi>existence</hi> from <hi>God,</hi> we lose the <hi>notion</hi> of a <hi>Being absolutely perfect.</hi>

The <hi>use</hi> of the <hi>hand</hi> is to <hi>take hold</hi> of any thing which man can <hi>use;</hi> now there being <hi>things</hi> of such <hi>different sizes</hi> which men may <hi>use,</hi> it had been impossible for the <hi>hand,</hi> if it had been one <hi>entire thing</hi> and <hi>undivided,</hi> that it could have held <hi>things greater</hi> or <hi>lesser</hi> then its self, but it must have been <hi>equal</hi> to it.

The other tells him, that every man is bred in the womb of one of the same kind with our selves, thus and thus formed; and that while we are in the womb we have a very little body, and there move, and are nourished, and we grow up by little and little till we come to such a bigness, and then we come forth into the world, and yet grow still till we come to such a proportion as we are of. Here presently this young man stops him and enquires, when we were thus little in the womb and did live, move, and grow, did we not eat and drink, and breath at our mouth and nostrils as we do now? did we not ease nature as now we do? If it be answered him, no; them he presently is ready to deny it, and offers to bring de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations</hi>
                  <pb n="434" facs="tcp:53276:239"/>
                  <hi>that it was utterly impossible it should be so. For, saith he, if either of us, cease breathing but for an hour, our motion and life is gone; how is it then possible for one of us though never so little, to live and move in the womb for so many months, when it is so close and shut up &amp; in the middle of the body? If one of us,</hi> saith he, <hi>should swallow a little bird, it would resently dye as soon as it came into the stomack, how much more if it were in the belly? If we should be but for few dayes without eating and drinking, we could not live; how can a childe then continue so many months without it? Again if one doth eat and not void the excrements of what he eats, he will be kild with it in few dayes; how can it possibly be otherwise with a child? If it be replyed that there is a passage open in the belly at which the child receives his nourishment, he will presently say that it is as impossible as the other; for if our bellyes were so open, we should be quickly destroyed. And again if the child bath all its limbs perfect and sound, how comes it not to open its eyes, use the feet, mouth and hands as we do? And so concludes it impossible that man should ever be born after this manner.</hi> Much after this way, saith that <hi>excellent Author,</hi> do <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>others</hi> argue against the <hi>production</hi> of the <hi>world;</hi> for if the <hi>world</hi> were produced, say they, it must have been <hi>thus</hi> and <hi>thus,</hi> and it is <hi>impossible</hi> that it should have been so: why? because we see things are otherwise <hi>now</hi> in the <hi>world.</hi> Which how <hi>infirme</hi> a way of <hi>arguing,</hi> it appears from the consideration of the former <hi>similitude,</hi> in which the <hi>argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> are as <hi>strong</hi> to prove the <hi>impossibility</hi> of that which we know to be <hi>true;</hi> as in the <hi>case</hi> about which we dispute.</p>

the nature of <hi>God,</hi> it would not be so with it. But there is this vast <hi>difference</hi> between them, that though <hi>God</hi> be <hi>essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> and <hi>necessarily good,</hi> yet the <hi>communications</hi> of this <hi>goodness</hi> are the effect of his <hi>Will,</hi> and not meerly of his <hi>nature;</hi> For were not the acts of <hi>beneficence</hi> and <hi>goodness</hi> in <hi>God</hi> the <hi>free acts</hi> of his <hi>will, man</hi> must be made as <hi>happy</hi> as he was <hi>capable</hi> of being, not only upon his first <hi>existence</hi> in the <hi>world,</hi> but as <hi>long</hi> as it should continue, by meer <hi>necessity</hi> of <hi>nature</hi> without any <hi>intervention</hi> of the <hi>will</hi> or <hi>actions</hi> of <hi>men.</hi> And so there could be no such difference as that of <hi>good</hi> and <hi>bad men</hi> in the <hi>world;</hi> for if the <hi>lettings</hi> forth of <hi>Gods goodness</hi> to the <hi>world</hi> be so <hi>necessary,</hi> all men must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>necessarily good,</hi> if <hi>Gods goodness</hi> be so great as to be able to make <hi>men</hi> so; which I suppose will not be questioned. By this then we <hi>see</hi> that the <hi>communications</hi> of <hi>Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> to the world are <hi>free,</hi> and depend upon the <hi>eternal counsels</hi> of his <hi>will,</hi> which is a <hi>depth</hi> too great for us to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, or look into; by what necessity then, if <hi>God</hi> be a <hi>free Agent,</hi> and of <hi>Infinite wisdom,</hi> as well as <hi>goodness,</hi> must we either assert the <hi>eternity</hi> of the <hi>world,</hi> or fear to deprive <hi>God</hi> of his <hi>essential Goodness?</hi> Whereas to make the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications</hi> of <hi>Gods goodness ad<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>extra necessary,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to make the <hi>world</hi> from <hi>eternity,</hi> that he might have an <hi>object</hi> to exercise his goodness on, is to take as much off from the <hi>Infinite perfection</hi> and <hi>self sufficiency</hi> of the <hi>divine nature</hi> as it would seem to <hi>flatter</hi> his <hi>goodness.</hi> For <hi>God</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be himself without his <hi>goodness;</hi> and if his <hi>goodness</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be without some <hi>creature</hi> to shew or <hi>display</hi> it upon, <hi>God</hi> cannot be <hi>perfect</hi> nor happy without his <hi>creatures</hi> because these are <hi>necessary issues</hi> of his <hi>goodness;</hi> and consequently we make the <hi>Being</hi> of the <hi>creatures</hi> necessary to his <hi>Being God.</hi> Which is the highest <hi>derogation</hi> from the <hi>absolute per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> of the <hi>Divine nature.</hi> We assert then so much <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> in <hi>God,</hi> as none can be imagined <hi>greater;</hi> we assert, that it was the <hi>communication</hi> of this <hi>Divine goodness</hi> which gave <hi>being</hi> to the <hi>world;</hi> but withall we acknowledge <hi>God</hi> to be an <hi>Agent infinitely wise</hi> and <hi>free,</hi> who dispenseth this <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of his in such a way and manner as is best pleasing to himself, though ever <hi>agreeable</hi> to his <hi>Nature.</hi> As God is

infinitely <hi>good</hi> in himself, so whatever he <hi>doth</hi> is <hi>suitable</hi> to this <hi>nature</hi> of his; but the particular <hi>determinations</hi> of the <hi>acts</hi> of <hi>Gods</hi> beneficence belong to the <hi>Will</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> as he is a most <hi>free</hi> and <hi>Independent Agent;</hi> so that <hi>goodness</hi> as it imports the necessary <hi>rectitude</hi> of the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> implyes a <hi>perfection</hi> inseparable from the true <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> but as it is taken for the <hi>expressions</hi> of Divine <hi>bounty</hi> to somewhat without, as the object of it, it is not implyed in our <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> as to his nature, but belongs to the free <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations</hi> of his Will.

For with what <hi>authority</hi> and <hi>Majesty</hi> doth <hi>God</hi> in the <hi>Scripture forbid</hi> all manner of sin? with what <hi>earnestness</hi> and <hi>importunity</hi> doth he <hi>woo</hi> the sinner to forsake his sin? with what <hi>loathing</hi> and <hi>detestation</hi> doth he <hi>mention</hi> sin? with what <hi>justice</hi> and <hi>severity</hi> doth he <hi>punish</hi> sin? with what <hi>wrath</hi> and <hi>indignation</hi> doth he <hi>threaten</hi> contumacious sinners? And is it possible, (after all this and much more, recorded in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> to express the <hi>holiness</hi> of <hi>Gods nature,</hi> his <hi>hatred</hi> of <hi>sin,</hi> and his <hi>appointing</hi> a <hi>day</hi> of <hi>judgement</hi> for the solemn punishment of sinners,) to imagine that the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures</hi> do in the least ascribe the <hi>Origine</hi> of <hi>evil</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> or make him the <hi>Author</hi> of <hi>Sin?

                  <hi>which the Scripture gives of the Origine of evil, doth any way charge it upon God?</hi> There are only two <hi>wayes,</hi> which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>history</hi> of the <hi>fall</hi> of <hi>man recorded</hi> in <hi>Scripture,</hi> whereby men may have any <hi>ground</hi> to <hi>question</hi> whether <hi>God</hi> were the <hi>cause</hi> of <hi>mans fall?</hi> either <hi>first,</hi> by the <hi>giving</hi> him that <hi>positive Law,</hi> which was the <hi>occasion</hi> of his fall; or <hi>secondly,</hi> by <hi>leaving him to the liberty of his own will. First, The giving of that positive Law cannot be the least ground of laying mans fault on God;</hi> because, 1. <hi>It was most suitable to the nature of a rational creature to be governed by Laws,</hi> or declarations of the Will of his Maker; For considering <hi>man</hi> as a <hi>free agent,</hi> there can be no way imagined so <hi>conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> to the <hi>nature</hi> of <hi>man</hi> as this was, because thereby he might <hi>declare</hi> his obedience to <hi>God</hi> to be the <hi>matter</hi> of his <hi>free choice.</hi> For where there is a <hi>capacity</hi> of <hi>reward,</hi> and <hi>punishment,</hi> and <hi>acting</hi> in the <hi>consideration</hi> of them, there must be a declaration of the will of the Law-giver, according to which man may expect either his <hi>reward</hi> or <hi>punishment.</hi> If it were <hi>suitable</hi> to <hi>Gods</hi> nature to promise <hi>life</hi> to <hi>man</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>obedience,</hi> it was not <hi>unsuitable</hi> to it to expect <hi>obedience</hi> to every <hi>declaration</hi> of his <hi>will;</hi> considering the <hi>absolute soveraignty</hi> and <hi>Dominion</hi> which <hi>God</hi> had over man as being his <hi>creature,</hi> and the indispensable <hi>obligation</hi> which was in the <hi>nature</hi> of <hi>man</hi> to <hi>obey</hi> whatever his <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So that <hi>God</hi> had <hi>full</hi> and <hi>absolute right</hi> to require from man, what he did as to the <hi>Law</hi> which he gave him to obey; and in the general we cannot conceive, how there should be a <hi>testimony</hi> of mans <hi>obedience</hi> towards h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s <hi>Creator,</hi> without some declaration of his Creators Will. Secondly, <hi>God had full power and authority, not only to govern man by Laws, but to determine mans general obligation to obedience to that particular positive precept by the breach of which man fell.</hi> If <hi>Gods power</hi> over man was <hi>universal</hi> and <hi>unlimited,</hi> what <hi>reason</hi> can there be to imagine it should not extend to
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:53276:263"/>
such a <hi>positive</hi> Law? Was it, because the <hi>matter of this Law seemed too low for God to command his creature?</hi> but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the <hi>matter</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> was, <hi>obedience</hi> to <hi>God</hi> was the great <hi>end</hi> of it, which man had testified as much in that <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> of it as in any other whatsoever; and in the <hi>violation</hi> of it were implyed the highest <hi>aggravations</hi> of <hi>disobedience;</hi> for <hi>Gods power</hi> and <hi>authority</hi> was as much <hi>contemned,</hi> his <hi>goodness slighted,</hi> his <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>faithfulness questioned,</hi> his <hi>Name dishonoured,</hi> his <hi>Maj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

If the <hi>Law</hi> were easie to be observed, the greater was the <hi>sin</hi> of <hi>disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;</hi> if the <hi>weight</hi> of the <hi>matter</hi> was not so <hi>great</hi> in its self, yet <hi>Gods authority</hi> added the <hi>greatest weight</hi> to it; and the <hi>ground</hi> of <hi>obedience</hi> is not to be fetched from the <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>thing</hi> required, but from the <hi>authority</hi> of the <hi>Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</hi> Or was it then because <hi>God</hi> concealed from <hi>man</hi> his <hi>counsel</hi> in giving of that <hi>positive precept?</hi> Hath not then a <hi>Legislator</hi> power to require any <hi>thing,</hi> but what he <hi>satisfies</hi> every one of his <hi>reason</hi> in commanding it? if so, what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of <hi>obedience</hi> and <hi>subjection?</hi> it will be impossible to make any <hi>probative precepts</hi> on this account; and the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislator</hi> must be charged with the <hi>disobedience</hi> of his <hi>subjects,</hi> where he doth not give a particular <hi>account</hi> of every thing which he requires; which as it concerns <hi>humane Legislators</hi> (who have not that absolute power and authority which <hi>God</hi> hath) is contrary to all <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Policy</hi> and the general sense of the world.

why may he not spare some to make them his <hi>instruments</hi> in the <hi>punishing</hi> of others, especially since after he hath used his <hi>rods</hi> he may cast them into the <hi>fire</hi> too? as was evident in the <hi>instance</hi> of <hi>Caesar,</hi> who after all his <hi>slaughters</hi> and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs was murdered in the <hi>Senate,</hi> and that by some who had been as <hi>active</hi> as any for him.

Therefore, another account why <hi>God</hi> may spare wicked men a great while, is, <hi>That divine providence might more remarkably be observed in the manner of their punishment afterwards.

                     <hi>All mankind derived from</hi> Adam, <hi>if the Scriptures be true. The contrary supposition an introduction to Atheism. The truth of the history of the flood. The possibility of an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal deluge proved. The flood universal as to mankind, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther universal as to the earth and animals; no necessity of asserting either. Yet supposing the possibility of it demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated without creation of new waters. Of the fountains of the deep. The proportion which the height of mountains bears to the Diameter of the earth. No mountains much above three mile perpendicular. Of the Origine of fountains. The opinion of</hi> Aristotle <hi>and others concerning it discussed. The true account of them from the vapours arising from the mass of subterraneous waters. Of the capacity of the Ark for receiving the Animals from</hi> Buteo <hi>and others. The truth of the deluge from the Testimony of Heathen Nations. Of the propagation of Nations from</hi> Noahs <hi>posterity. Of the beginning of the</hi> Assyrian <hi>Empire. The multiplication of mankind after the flood. Of the Chronology of the LXX. Of the time between the flood and</hi> Abraham, <hi>and the advantages of it. Of the pretence of such Nations, who called them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Aborigines. A discourse concerning the first plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of</hi> Greece, <hi>the common opinion propounded and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected. The</hi> Hellens <hi>not the first inhabitants of</hi> Greece, <hi>but the</hi> Pelasgi. <hi>The large spread of them over the parts of</hi> Greece; <hi>Of their language different from the</hi> Greeks. <hi>Whence these</hi> Pelasgi <hi>came; that</hi> Phaleg <hi>was the</hi> Pelasgus <hi>of</hi> Greece, <hi>and the leader of that Colony proved from</hi> Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius: <hi>the language of the</hi> Pelasgi <hi>in</hi> Greece <hi>Oriental: thence an account given of the many Hebrew words in the Greek language, and the remainders of the Eastern langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in the Islands of</hi> Greece, <hi>both which not from the</hi> Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicians <hi>as</hi> Bochartus <hi>thinks, but from the old</hi> Pelasgi. <hi>Of the ground of the affinity between the</hi> Jews <hi>and</hi> Lacedaemonians. <hi>Of the peopling of</hi> Amercia.</p>

And when our <hi>Saviour</hi> would reduce all things to the <hi>beginning,</hi> he instanceth in those words which were pronounced after <hi>Eve</hi> was formed, <hi>But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and</hi>

                  <hi>female; for this cause shall a man leave Father and Mother and cleave unto his Wife.</hi> Now nothing can be more plain and easie then from hence to argue thus; those of whom those words were spoken, were the first male and female which were made in the <hi>beginning</hi> of the Creation; but it is evident these words were spoken of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve: And</hi> Adam <hi>said, this is now bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 2. 23. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>therefore shall a man leave his Father and his Mother and shall cleave unto his Wife.</hi> If the <hi>Scriptures</hi> then of the <hi>New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> be true, it is most plain and evident that all mankind is descended from <hi>Adam;</hi> and no less conspicuous is it from the <hi>history</hi> of the <hi>Creation</hi> as delivered by <hi>Moses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For how necessary had it been for <hi>Moses,</hi> when he was <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 2.</note> giving an account of the <hi>Origine</hi> of <hi>things,</hi> to have disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by whom the world was first planted, if there had been any such <hi>plantation</hi> before <hi>Adam;</hi> but to say that all the design of <hi>Moses</hi> was only to give an account of the <hi>Origine</hi> and history of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Nation, and that <hi>Adam</hi> was only the first of that stock, is manifestly ridiculous, it being so clear, that not only from <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> but from <hi>Sem, Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Isaac</hi> came other Nations besides that of <hi>Iews.</hi> And by the same reason that it is said, that <hi>Moses</hi> only speaks of the <hi>Origine</hi> of the <hi>Iewish Nation</hi> in the <hi>history</hi> of <hi>Adam,</hi> it may as well be said that <hi>Moses</hi> speaks only of the making of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and that part of the <hi>heavens</hi> which was over it, when he describes the <hi>Creation</hi> of the <hi>world</hi> in the six dayes work. For why may not the <hi>earth</hi> in
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:53276:290"/>
the second <hi>ver.</hi> of <hi>Genesis</hi> be as well understood of the <hi>Land</hi> of <hi>Iudea,</hi> and the light and production of <hi>animals</hi> and <hi>vegetables</hi> refer only to that, as to understand it so in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the <hi>flood,</hi> and in many other passages relating to those eldest times? But the <hi>Author</hi> of that <hi>Hypothesis</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers, <hi>That the first Chapter of</hi> Genesis <hi>may relate to the true Origine of the world and the first peopling of it, but in the second</hi> Moses <hi>begins to give an account of the first man and woman of the Iewish Nation.</hi> Very probable! but if this be not a putting asunder those which <hi>God</hi> hath joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, nothing is. For doth not <hi>Moses</hi> plainly at first give an account of the formation of <hi>things</hi> in the first six dayes, and of his <hi>rest</hi> on the <hi>seventh?</hi> but how could he be said to have rested then from the <hi>works</hi> of <hi>Creation,</hi> if after this followed the <hi>formation</hi> of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> in the second Chapter? Besides if the <hi>forming</hi> of <hi>man</hi> mentioned, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 7. be distinct from that mentioned. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 27. then by all <hi>parity</hi> of <hi>reason,</hi>

Again further, if there had been any such persons in the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Adam,</hi> no doubt <hi>Adam</hi> himself was ignorant of them; or else it had been a false and ridiculous account which he gives of the name of his wife <gap reason="foreign">

But what ever the credit or authority of these <hi>versions</hi> be, this is most certain, that <hi>Adam</hi> had no reason at all to have given this name to his <hi>wife,</hi> as being <hi>the mother of all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,</hi> if there had been any of mankind existing in the world from other mothers, which had been long before <hi>Eve</hi> was formed. So that we find it plain and clear, that if the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port given of things in <hi>Scripture</hi> be true, the <hi>hypothesis</hi> of <hi>Prae-Adamites</hi> is undoubtedly false. And certainly who ever seriously considers the frequent reflections on the <hi>authority</hi> of the <hi>Scriptures</hi> which were cast by the <hi>author</hi> of that <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> and his endeavouring on all occasions to <hi>derogate</hi> from the <hi>miracles</hi> recorded in it, may easily suspect the design of that <hi>Author</hi> was not to gain any credit to his opinion from those arguments from <hi>Scripture,</hi> which he makes shew of (which are pittifully weak and ridiculous) but having by the help of such arguments made his opinion more plausible, his hope was that his opinion would in time undermine the <hi>Scriptures</hi> themselves. When he had made it appear that the account given in the <hi>Scriptures</hi> of the plantation of the world was unsatisfactory, since there were men before <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> which the <hi>Scriptures</hi> to please the <hi>Iewish Nation,</hi> take no notice of. So that after he had attempted to <hi>prostitute</hi> the <hi>Scriptures</hi> to his opinion, his next work had been to have turned them out of <hi>doors,</hi> as not of <hi>credit</hi> to be relyed on by any when they were so common to every opinion. But how impious, absurd and rude that attempt was upon the <hi>sacred</hi> and <hi>inviolable authority</hi> of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> hath been so fully discovered by his very many not unlearned adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, that it might seem needless so much as to have taken notice of so weakly grounded, and infirmly proved an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, had it not thus far lain in my way in order to the clearing the true <hi>Origine</hi> of <hi>Nations</hi> according to the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> The main <hi>foundations</hi> of which fabulous opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on lying chiefly in the pretended <hi>antiquities</hi> of the <hi>Chaldae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Egyptians,</hi> and others, have been fully taken away in our first <hi>bsok,</hi> where our whole design was to manifest the want of <hi>credibility</hi> in those <hi>accounts</hi> of <hi>ancient times,</hi> which are delivered by <hi>Heathen Nations</hi> in opposition to the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.</hi> There is nothing at all in <hi>Scripture</hi> from the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>

of <hi>Adam</hi> to the <hi>flood</hi> which seems to give any counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to that <hi>figment,</hi> but only what may be easily resolved from the <hi>consideration</hi> of the great <hi>conciseness</hi> of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saick History,</hi> in reporting that long interval of time which was between the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> and the <hi>Flood;</hi> By means of which conciseness such things are reported as speedily done, because immediatly succeeding in the story, which asked a very considerable time before they could be effected, and besides all things which were done before the Flood, being all quite obliterated by it, and all the numerous posterity of <hi>Adam</hi> being then destroyed (only <hi>Noah</hi> and his Family ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) to what purpose had it been any further to have reported the <hi>passages</hi> before the <hi>Flood,</hi> otherwise then thereby to let us understand the <hi>certainty</hi> of the <hi>succession</hi> of persons from <hi>Adam,</hi> and such <hi>actions</hi> in those times which might be remarkable <hi>discoveries</hi> of <hi>Gods providence</hi> and mans <hi>wickedness</hi> in it, which being most apparent at first in <hi>Cain</hi> and his posteriry, did by degrees so spread its self over the face of the then inhabited world, that the just <hi>God</hi> was thereby provoked to send a <hi>Deluge</hi> among them to sweep away the present inhabitants to make room for another <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration</hi> to succeed them.</p>
               <p>This therefore we now come to consider, <hi>viz. the History of the flood,</hi> and the <hi>certainty of the propagation of the world</hi>

much longer a <hi>space</hi> of <hi>time</hi> since the <hi>flood</hi> to this day, the earth is capable of receiving far more <hi>inhabitants,</hi> then now it hath. The only probability then left for asserting the <hi>universality</hi> of the <hi>Flood,</hi> as to the <hi>Globe</hi> of the <hi>earth,</hi> is from the destruction of all <hi>living creatures</hi> together with <hi>man;</hi> now though men might not have spread themselves over the whole <hi>surface</hi> of the <hi>earth,</hi> yet <hi>beasts</hi> and <hi>creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things</hi> might which were all destroyed with the Flood: For it is said, <hi>That all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl and of cattel, and of beast, and of every creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thing, that creepeth upon the earth, and every man.</hi> To what end should there be not only a note of universality ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but such a particular enumeration of the several <hi>kinds</hi> of <hi>beasts, creeping things,</hi> and <hi>fowls,</hi> if they were not all destroyed? To this I answer. I grant as far as the <hi>Flood extended,</hi> all these were destroyed; but I see no reason to extend the <hi>destruction</hi> of these beyond that <hi>compass</hi> and <hi>space</hi> of <hi>earth</hi> where men inhabited: Because the punishment upon the <hi>beasts</hi> was <hi>occasioned by,</hi> and could not but be <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant</hi> with the <hi>destruction</hi> of <hi>mankinde,</hi> but (the occasion of the <hi>deluge</hi> being the <hi>sin</hi> of <hi>man,</hi> who was punished in the beasts, that were destroyed for his sake, as well as in himself) where the <hi>occasion</hi> was not, as where there were <hi>animals,</hi> and no men, there seems no necessity of extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Flood</hi> thither. But to what end then it will be repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Did God command</hi> Noah <hi>with so much care to take of all kind of beasts, and birds, and creeping things into the ark with him, if all these living creatures were not destroyed by the Flood?</hi> I answer, because all those things were destroyed where ever the <hi>Flood</hi> was; suppose then the whole <hi>Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent</hi> of <hi>Asia</hi> was peopled before the <hi>Flood,</hi> which is as much as we may in reason suppose, I say, all the living <hi>creatures</hi> in that <hi>Continent</hi> were all destroyed; or if we may suppose it to have extended over our whole <hi>Continent</hi> of the <hi>anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently known world;</hi> what reason would there be that in the opposite <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>globe, viz.

by <hi>Gods power</hi> given to that <hi>material principle</hi> out of which they were formed, it may very well be supposed that many of the same kind were at first produced. For it seems very strange to imagine that in the whole <hi>Ocean</hi> there should be only <hi>two</hi> of a kind produced; but <hi>Fish</hi> and <hi>Fowl</hi> both arising from the <hi>water,</hi> we may have just reason to think, that the <hi>waters</hi> being separated before this <hi>prolifick vertue</hi> was communicated to the whole <hi>masse</hi> of <hi>waters,</hi> might in the several <hi>parts</hi> of the <hi>globe</hi> of the earth, bring forth both <hi>fish</hi> and <hi>fowl</hi> after their kinds. The same I say of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of <hi>Animals</hi> in the sixth days work, which are ranked into three sorts, <hi>Cattel, creeping things,</hi> and <hi>beasts</hi> of the <hi>earth</hi> after their kinds; now <hi>God</hi> saying, <hi>Let the earth bring forth her living creatures</hi> (and that after the waters had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided some parts of the <hi>earth</hi> from other, so that there could be no passage for the cattel, creeping things, and beasts out of one part into another, without the help of man) it seems very probable that at least those <hi>parts</hi> of the <hi>earth</hi> which were thus divided from each other, did bring forth these several living <hi>creatures</hi> after their kinds, which did after propagate in those parts without being brought thither by the help of man. If now this <hi>supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> be embraced, by it we presently clear our selves of many <hi>difficulties</hi> concerning the <hi>propagation</hi> of <hi>animals</hi> in the world, and their conservation in the <hi>Ark,</hi> which many have been so much to seek for satisfaction in. As how the unknown kind of <hi>Serpents</hi> in <hi>Brasil,</hi> the <hi>slow-bellied</hi> creature of the <hi>Indies,</hi> and all those strange <hi>species</hi> of <hi>ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals</hi> seen in the <hi>West Indies</hi> should either come into the <hi>Ark</hi> of <hi>Noah,</hi> or be conveyed out of it into those <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries</hi> which are divided from that <hi>Continent</hi> where the Flood was by so vast an <hi>Ocean</hi> on the one side, and at least so large a tract of <hi>Land</hi> on the other (supposing any passage but of one <hi>Continent</hi> into another, which yet hath not been dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.) Besides some kind of <hi>Animals</hi> cannot live out of that particular <hi>Clime</hi> wherein they are; and there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny sorts of <hi>animals</hi> discovered in <hi>America,</hi> and the adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Islands,</hi> which have left no <hi>remainders</hi> of <hi>themselves</hi> in these parts of the world. And it seems very strange that
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:53276:293"/>
these, should propagate into those remote <hi>parts</hi> of the <hi>world</hi> from the place of the <hi>Flood,</hi> and leave none at all of their number behind them in those parts from whence they were propagated. These things at least make that opinion very probable which extends the <hi>production</hi> of <hi>animals</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond that of <hi>mankinde</hi> in the old world, and that the <hi>Flood</hi> though it destroyed all <hi>mankinde,</hi> and every <hi>living creature</hi> within that compass wherein mankind inhabited, yet might not extend its self to those parts, and the <hi>animals</hi> therein, in which men had never inhabited. And by this means we need not make so many <hi>miracles</hi> as some are fain to do about the <hi>slood;</hi> and all those difficulties concerning the <hi>propagation</hi> of <hi>animals</hi> do of themselves vanish and fail to the groud.

And besides the <hi>rain-water</hi> runs most upon the <hi>surface</hi> of the <hi>earth,</hi> and so doth rather <hi>swell</hi> the <hi>rivers</hi> which thereby run with greater force in their passage to the Ocean, and doth not lodge it self presently in the <hi>earth,</hi> especially if it descends in a greater <hi>quantity</hi> which alone is able to fill such <hi>Cisterns</hi> supposed to be in the earth, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in mountains, which may keep a <hi>stream</hi> continually running. Although therefore we may acknowledge that the <hi>fall</hi> of <hi>rain</hi> may much conduce to the <hi>overflowing</hi> and <hi>continuance</hi> of <hi>Fountains,</hi> as is evident by the greater force of <hi>springs</hi> after continued <hi>rains,</hi> and by the decay of many of them in <hi>hot</hi> and <hi>dry weather</hi> (which yet I had rather im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute to the <hi>Suns</hi> exhaling by his continued heat those moist <hi>vapours</hi> in the earth, which should continually supply the <hi>springs,</hi> then meerly to the want of rain) and by the rise of most great <hi>rivers</hi> from such <hi>Fountains</hi> which came from the <hi>foot</hi> of <hi>mountains;</hi> where the ground is supposed to be of so hard and consistent a substance, as stone, or chalke, or something of like nature which might help to the conserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of water there, from whence it after ran in streams to the Ocean (which was the great argument of the famous <hi>Peireskius</hi> for this opinion) although I say, these things may argue thus far, that <hi>rain-water</hi> doth much conduce to the <note place="margin">

And thence as the <hi>blood</hi> with equal freedom and velocity ascends into the <hi>head</hi> as it <hi>runs</hi> into the <hi>legs,</hi> because it is equally <hi>dispersed</hi> into all the parts from the <hi>center</hi> of it; so in the body of the earth it is as natural for the <hi>water</hi> to ascend into the <hi>tops</hi> of <hi>mountains,</hi> as it is to fall down into the center of the earth. And that it is no more wonder to see <hi>springs</hi> issue out of <hi>mountains,</hi> then it is to see a man <hi>bleed</hi> in the <hi>veins</hi> of his <hi>forehead</hi> when he is let blood there. So in all places of the earth the parts of it are not disposed for <hi>apertion;</hi> for some of them are so <hi>hard</hi> and <hi>compact,</hi> that there seems to be no passage through them (which is the most probable reason, why there is no <hi>rain</hi> neither in those places, because there is no such exsudation of those moist <hi>vapours</hi> through the <hi>surface</hi> of the <hi>earth,</hi> which may yeild matter for <hi>rain,</hi> as it is in many of the san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy places of <hi>Africa,</hi> but usually mountainous Countryes have more large, and as it were <hi>Temple-veins</hi> through which the moist <hi>vapours</hi> have a free and open passage, and thence there are not only more frequent <hi>springs</hi> there, but <hi>clouds</hi> and <hi>rains</hi> too.) Now if this account of the <hi>Origine</hi> of <hi>springs</hi> in the earth be as rational as it is ingenious and handsome (and there is not much can be said against it, but only that then all <hi>fountains</hi> should be <hi>salt</hi> as the water is from whence they come) then we easily understand how the <hi>earth</hi> might be <hi>overflowed</hi> in the universal <hi>deluge;</hi> for then the <hi>fountains</hi> of the <hi>deep</hi> were broken up, or there was an <hi>universal open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of the <hi>veins</hi> of the earth, whereby all the water contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in them would presently run upon the <hi>surface</hi> of the

earth, and must needs according to its proportion advance its self to a considerable height. But because the salving the difference of the <hi>water</hi> in <hi>springs</hi> from what it is in the <hi>Sea</hi> is so considerable a <hi>phaenomenon</hi> in our present case, I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore rather take this following as the most <hi>rational</hi> account of the <hi>Origine</hi> of <hi>fountains.</hi> viz. That there are great <hi>cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes</hi> in the <hi>earth,</hi> which are capable of receiving a consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>quantity</hi> of <hi>water,</hi> which continually runs into them from the <hi>Sea</hi> (which as it continually receives fresh sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes from the rivers which empty themselves into it, so it dispatcheth away a like quantity through those <hi>spongy</hi> parts of the earth under the <hi>Ocean,</hi> which are most apt to suck in and convey away the surplusage of water) so that by this means the <hi>Sea</hi> never swells by the water conveyed into it by the <hi>rivers,</hi> there being as continual a <hi>circulation</hi> in the <hi>body</hi> of the earth of the <hi>water</hi> which passeth out of the <hi>Ocean</hi> into the <hi>subterraneous cavernes,</hi> and from thence to the <hi>mountains,</hi> and thence into the <hi>Sea</hi> again; as there is a <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation</hi> of <hi>blood</hi> in mans body from the <hi>heart</hi> by the <hi>arteryes</hi> into the <hi>exteriour parts,</hi> and returning back again by the <hi>veins</hi> into the <hi>heart.</hi> According to which we may imagine such a place in the heart of the earth like <hi>Plato</hi>'s <hi>Bara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrum,</hi>

disjoyned from each other by the <hi>heat,</hi> by reason of which they attain a greater <hi>celerity</hi> of <hi>motion,</hi> and so pass through the inner <hi>pores</hi> of the earth till they come near the <hi>superficies</hi> of it. Which when they have approached to, they are beat back again by the <hi>cold</hi> which environs the <hi>surface</hi> of the <hi>earth,</hi> or at least are so arrested by the <hi>cold</hi> and condensed by it, that they lose the form of <hi>vapours</hi> and become per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>water</hi> again. Which <hi>water</hi> being now more <hi>gross,</hi> then while it was a meer <hi>vapour,</hi> cannot descend again through the same <hi>pores</hi> through which it ascended before, because these are not now capable of receiving it: And therefore it seeks out some <hi>wider passages</hi> near the <hi>surface</hi> of the <hi>earth,</hi> by which means it moves in an <hi>oblique manner,</hi> and is ready to embrace any other <hi>vapours</hi> which are <hi>arrested</hi> in the same manner; now when these are grown to a consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>body</hi> in the <hi>surface</hi> of a <hi>mountain,</hi> or a <hi>plain,</hi> and find a vent fit for them, there appears a proper <hi>fountain</hi> whose <hi>streams</hi> are still maintained by the same <hi>condensation</hi> of <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours,</hi> which when they are once come abroad are in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual <hi>motion</hi> whereby <hi>rivers</hi> are made, which are still find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a passage through the <hi>declivity</hi> of the <hi>surface</hi> of the earth, whereby they may return to the <hi>Ocean</hi> again. Now according to this account, that grand <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> of the <hi>freshness</hi> of <hi>fountain water</hi> when the water of the <hi>Sea</hi> is salt, whence it originally comes, is sufficiently resolved. For meer <hi>transcolation</hi> may by degrees take away that which the <hi>Chymists</hi> call the <hi>fixed salt;</hi> and for the <hi>Volatile salt</hi> of it (which being a more spirituous thing, is not removable by <hi>distillation,</hi> and so neither can it be by <hi>transcolation)</hi> yet such an <hi>evaporation</hi> as that mentioned, may serve to do it, because it is evident that <hi>fresh water</hi> will fall from the <hi>clouds</hi> which hath risen from those <hi>vapours</hi> which have come out of the <hi>Sea;</hi> and besides these <hi>vapours</hi> or small <hi>particles</hi> of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in their passage through the earth (especially when they come near the surface of it) do <hi>incorporate</hi> with other <hi>sweet vapours</hi> as those which come from <hi>rain</hi> and others, by which means they insensibly lose their former <hi>acidity</hi> and <hi>sharpness.</hi> But those <hi>fountains</hi> which do retain their former <hi>saltness,</hi> as there are many such in the world, may very probably <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

supposed not to have come from these <hi>vapours</hi> condensed, but to be a kind of a breaking of <hi>vein</hi> in which the <hi>salt</hi> water was conveyed up and down the <hi>body</hi> of the earth. Now then considering that <hi>mass</hi> of <hi>waters</hi> and multitude of <hi>vapours</hi> arising thence which are in the earth, how easie is it for us to understand what the <hi>breaking open</hi> the <hi>fountains</hi> of the <hi>deep</hi> means in <hi>Scripture,</hi> and how by that means to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the <hi>falling</hi> down of the <hi>Cataracts</hi> of the clouds, and the letting <hi>loose</hi> of the <hi>Ocean,</hi> the whole earth might be overspread with an universal deluge. The possibility of which was the thing to be shewed.</p>
               <p>The next thing we come to concerning the <hi>flood,</hi> is, the <hi>capacity</hi> of the <hi>Ark</hi> for receiving the several <hi>animals</hi> which <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 7.</note> were to propagate the world afterwards. Concerning which, two things are necessary to be understood, what the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the <hi>Ark</hi> was, and what the <hi>number</hi> of <hi>animals</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it. The measure of the <hi>Ark</hi> must be determined by the <hi>proportion</hi> of the <hi>cubit,</hi> which there is no reason at all to suppose either with <hi>Origen</hi> and others to have been the <hi>Geometrical cubit,</hi> which contains six ordinary cubits or nine <hi>feet,</hi> both because we find no mention at all of any such <hi>cubit</hi> in <hi>Scripture,</hi> and because the <hi>Fabrick</hi> of the Ark would have been of too vast a proportion; Neither yet is it probable, which Sir <hi>W. Rawlegh</hi> supposeth, that this <hi>cubit</hi> must be of a proportion as much exceeding ours as the <hi>stature</hi> of a <hi>Gyant</hi> doth ours, both because there is no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>evidence,</hi> either from <hi>Scripture</hi> or <hi>reason,</hi> that the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion</hi> of men then did generally exceed what is now; and besides this tends not in the least to make the thing more plain. For according to that proportion, we must then have imagined <hi>beasts</hi> to have been as well as men; for the <hi>horse</hi> must have been <hi>proportionably</hi> as <hi>great</hi> to have been <hi>serviceable</hi> to men of that stature, and so the <hi>Animals</hi> would have taken up as much more room in the Ark as the <hi>cubit</hi> is supposed to be bigger. I suppose then that <hi>Moses</hi> speaks of the <hi>cubit</hi> most in <hi>use</hi> in his own time, (for he writ so that they for whose use he writ might be easily able to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand him) now this <hi>cubit</hi> by the consent of writers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a <hi>foot</hi> and a <hi>half</hi> in length; according to which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,

supposing the <hi>Ark</hi> by <hi>Moses</hi> his description to have 300. <hi>cubits</hi> in length, 50. in <hi>breadth,</hi> and 30. in <hi>height,</hi>

In stead of that therefore, I shall consider the pretences which can be brought against it, which are chiefly these three. 1.

That the most learned <hi>Heathen Nations</hi> pretend to be <hi>self-originated,</hi> and that they came not from any other <hi>Country.</hi> 3. That no certain account is given from whence <hi>America</hi> should be peopled.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The History of the <hi>Assyrian Empire</hi> seems inconsistent <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 9.</note> with the propagation of the world from the sons of <hi>Noah;</hi> for the reign of <hi>Ninus</hi> and <hi>Semiramis</hi> is placed by many <hi>Chronologers</hi> within the first Century after the flood, which seems a manifest inconsistency with the propagation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind from the Sons of <hi>Noah;</hi> for it seems utterly impossible that the <hi>foundations</hi> of so great an <hi>Empire</hi> should be laid in so small a compass of time by the <hi>posterity</hi> of three <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;</hi> and besides <hi>Ninus</hi> and <hi>Semiramis</hi> were not the first who began the <hi>Assyrian Empire;</hi> for <hi>Belus</hi> not only raigned fifty five years before <hi>Ninus,</hi> but according to the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dean Antiquities</hi> from <hi>Evechous,</hi> who they say first reigned among them, are reckoned 495. years.

to the <hi>Hebrew computation,</hi> in the compass of 300. years, <hi>viz.</hi> about <hi>Abrahams</hi> time, the world was so fully peopled, that we read of several Kings encountering one another, by which it is evident the world had been peopled sometime before, or else there could not have been such <hi>potent Kings</hi> as some of them were at that time. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the grand difficulty, to it I answer these things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is no such <hi>certainty</hi> of the beginning of the <hi>Assyrian Empire,</hi> as for the sake of that, to question the truth of the propagation of the world by the sons of <hi>Noah.</hi> I havealready largely manifested the want of credibility in the <hi>Chronology</hi> of the <hi>ancient Chaldeans,</hi> and that we have no certain grounds to rely upon in reference to it. Especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as to those seven first <hi>Babylonian Kings,</hi> which are cited out of <hi>Africanus</hi> by <hi>Eusebius,</hi> and <hi>Georgius Syncellus,</hi> viz. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vechous, Chomasbolus, Porus, Nechubes, Abius, Oniballus, Chinzirus,</hi> who are said to reign 225. years, two moneths; and alike fabulous, I suppose, is the other <hi>Dynasty</hi> of six <hi>Arabian Kings,</hi> whose Empire is said to have stood 215. years to the time of <hi>Belus,</hi> who expelled the <hi>Arabians</hi> and took the power to himself; And it is much more agreeable to reason to reject these two <hi>Dynastyes,</hi> which have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of them left in any <hi>History</hi> of the <hi>Assyrian Empire,</hi> but only in <hi>Berosus,</hi> whose authority in this case hath been dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussed already, then to follow our late excellent <hi>Primate</hi> of <hi>Armagh,</hi> who punctually sets down the reign of the Kings of these two <hi>Dynastyes,</hi> but cuts off at least eight <hi>Ages</hi> in the time of the <hi>Assyrian Empire</hi> from <hi>Ninus</hi> to <hi>Sardana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palus,</hi> which time he confines to 496. years, and placeth <hi>Ninus</hi> in the 2737. year of the world, according to the <note place="margin">

2. We have reason to think that there was a more then ordinary <hi>multiplication</hi> of the <hi>world</hi> from the sons of <hi>Noah</hi> after the <hi>Flood.</hi> For as <hi>God</hi> had before punished the world by destroying mankind in it by an extraordinary manner; so after the <hi>Flood,</hi> he doth in a particular manner bless <hi>Noah</hi> and his <hi>Sons,</hi> and said unto them, <hi>Be fruitfull and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, and replenish the earth,</hi> which may well be thought to have then had an extraordinary effect. Severall ways have been attempted by learned men to make appear, to what a vast number the posterity of <hi>Noah</hi> would increase in the space of two of three <hi>hundred years</hi> after the Flood. <hi>Peta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi> supposeth that the posterity of <hi>Noah</hi> might beget chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren <note place="margin">

                     <hi>Usser. Chronol.

Others suppose that each of the <hi>sons</hi> of <hi>Noah</hi> had <hi>ten sons,</hi> and by that proportion, in few Generations, it would amount to many <hi>thousands</hi> within a Century. Others insist on the <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel</hi> between the <hi>multiplication</hi> of the <hi>children</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi> in <hi>Egypt;</hi> that if from 72. men in the space of 215. years there are procreated 600000. how many will be born of three men in the space of an hundred years? some have said above 23000. but with what success in their <hi>Arithmetick</hi> I shall not determine. But whether all or any of these <hi>ways</hi>

               <p>The whole <hi>controversie</hi> concerning this part of the <hi>Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology</hi> of the world comes at last to this, whether it be more probable that the <hi>Iews,</hi> who lived under the <hi>second Temple</hi> (who then were the Trustees to whom were <hi>committed the oracles of God)</hi> whom the LXX. followed in their version, had the true <hi>reading,</hi> or the <hi>Talmudick Iews</hi> after their <hi>dispersion</hi> and <hi>banishment</hi> from their <hi>Country,</hi> when they were <hi>discarded</hi> by <hi>God</hi> himself from being his <hi>people,</hi> when he broke up <hi>house</hi> among them at the <hi>destruction</hi> of <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> and the <hi>Temple.</hi> But if the reader desire further satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction concerning this <hi>difference</hi> of the <hi>Chronology</hi> of the <hi>LXX.</hi> from that of the present <hi>Hebrew copyes,</hi> he may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult the learned <hi>dissertation</hi> of the late learned Bishop of <note place="margin">

                  <hi>Chester</hi> upon the <hi>LXX.</hi> and the later <hi>discourses</hi> of <hi>Isaac Vossius</hi> on this subject. Seting a side then the controversie between the present <hi>Hebrew copyes</hi> and the <hi>LXX.</hi> in point of <hi>integrity</hi> and <hi>incorruption</hi> which I meddle not with, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but subscribe to the judgement of our judicious histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, Sir <hi>W. Rawleigh: That if we look over all, and do not hastily satisfie our understanding with the first things offered, and thereby being satiated do slothfully and drowsily sit down, we shall find it more agreeable rather to follow the reckoning of the LXX. who according to some editions make it above</hi> 1072. <hi>years between the flood and</hi> Abrahams <hi>birth, then to take away any part of those</hi> 352. <hi>years given. For if we advisedly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the state and ceuntenance of the world such as it was in</hi> Abrahams <hi>time, yea before</hi> Abraham <hi>was born, we shall find that it were very ill done of us by following opinion without the</hi>
                  <pb n="558" facs="tcp:53276:301"/>
                  <hi>guide of reason, to pare the time over deeply between</hi> Abraham <hi>and the flood; because in cutting them too near the quick, the reputation of the whole story might perchance bleed thereby, were not the Testimony of the Scriptures supreme so as no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection can approach it; And that we did not follow withall this precept of St.</hi> Austin, <hi>that wheresoever any one place in the Scriptures may be conceived disagreeing to the whole, the same is by ignorance of misinterpretation understood. For in</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams <hi>time all the then known parts of the world were peopled: all regions and countryes had their Kings.</hi> Aegypt <hi>had many magnificent Cities, and so had</hi> Palestine <hi>and all bordering Countryes; yea all that part of the world be sides as far as</hi> India: <hi>and those not built with sticks, but of hewn stones, and defended with walls and rampiers, which magnificence needed a parent of more antiquity then those other men have supposed. And therefore where the Scriptures are plainest and best agreeing with reason and nature, to what end should we labour to beget doubts and scruples, or draw all things into wonders and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails? giving also strength thereby to common cavillers, and to those mens apish brains, who only bend their wits to find im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibilities and monsters in the story of the world and mankind.</hi> Thus far that excellent Historian, whose <hi>words</hi> deserve <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration.</hi> Thus much for the first <hi>objection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second is, <hi>From the great pretence of several nations that they were self-originated,</hi> or came not from any other <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 10. 2.</note> place. This was the <hi>pretence</hi> of the <hi>Aegyptians, Graecians,</hi> ancient <hi>inhabitants</hi> of <hi>Italy,</hi> and others. But how little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son we have to give credit to these <hi>pretences,</hi> will appear on these accounts. 1. <hi>The impossibility</hi> in nature that <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind</hi> should be <hi>produced</hi> in such a way as they imagined, which we have manifested already in our discourse of the <hi>Origine</hi> of the universe. 2. That the <hi>Nations</hi> which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended this, were never able to give sufficient <hi>evidence</hi> of it to any other <hi>Nation</hi> which demanded it; which is manifest: by their want of any certain <hi>records</hi> of their ancient times, which is fully proved in our discourse in the first book of the want of <hi>credibility</hi> in <hi>Heathen histories.</hi> 3. The only prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able reason, which induced these Nations to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves <hi>Aborigines,</hi> was, because they supposed themselves to
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:53276:301"/>
be the first <hi>inhabitants</hi> of the <hi>Countryes</hi> they lived in, which although I may allow to the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> and some other ancient <hi>Nations,</hi> yet I cannot do it to the <hi>Hellens</hi> or <hi>Greeks,</hi> who most vainly and arrogantly pretended to it. Which because it may give more light into the greatest <hi>antiquities</hi> of <hi>Greece</hi> and some other Nations then hath been yet dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered or taken notice of, and because it may further tend to clear the <hi>truth</hi> of the <hi>Scriptures</hi> as to the <hi>Origine</hi> of <hi>Nations,</hi> I shall more particularly enquire into the first <hi>Plantation</hi> of <hi>Greece.</hi> That it was first inhabited by some of <hi>Noahs posterity,</hi> is out of question with all those who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the most <hi>ancient</hi> and undoubted <hi>records</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fabulous impostures of mens brains. But by whose immediate posterity the <hi>Country</hi> of <hi>Greece</hi> was first inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, is not yet so clear as it hath been generally presumed to be, by most who had rather follow the dictates of others then spend time in such enquiries themselves: Which yet certainly are so far from being unworthy mens labour and industry, that nothing tends more clearly to advance the truth of <hi>Scripture-history,</hi> then the reconciling the <hi>anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities</hi> of the <hi>elder Nations</hi> to what we find delivered of the plantation of the world from the <hi>posterity</hi> of <hi>Noah.</hi> As to this particular therefore of the first <hi>plantation</hi> of <hi>Greece,</hi> I shall first propound the opinion generally embraced among learned men, and then shew how far it is defective, and what other more true account may be given of it. It is evident from <hi>Moses,</hi> Gen. 10. 5. that the <hi>posterity</hi> of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi> took possession of the <hi>Isles</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> i. e. accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Hebrew Idiome,</hi> not only such as are properly so calld, but all those <hi>Countries</hi> which lay much upon the <hi>Sea,</hi> being at any distance from <hi>Palestine,</hi> especially such as lay between the <hi>Ocean</hi> and <hi>Mediterranean Sea;</hi> and so both <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> come under the name of the <hi>Isles</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Among the sons of <hi>Iaphet</hi> none is conceived so probable to have first peopled <hi>Greece,</hi> as he whose name was preserved among the <hi>inhabitants</hi> of <hi>Greece</hi> with very little alteration. And so as the <hi>Medes</hi> from <hi>Madai,</hi> the <hi>Assyrians</hi> from <hi>Assur,</hi> the <hi>Thracians</hi> from <hi>Thiras,</hi> by the like <hi>Analogy</hi> the <hi>Ionians</hi> from <hi>Iavan.</hi> From which it is observable that
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:53276:302"/>
although among the <hi>Greeks</hi> themselves, the <hi>Ionians</hi> were but as one <hi>division</hi> of that <hi>people</hi> which inhabited <hi>Greece,</hi> yet other Nations comprehended all under the name of <hi>Ionians.</hi> For which we have sufficient evidence from <hi>Hesychius</hi> and the <hi>Scholiast</hi> on <hi>Aristophanes.</hi>

For although the name of <hi>Hellens</hi> at last spread its self over all the people of <hi>Greece,</hi> yet it was at first peculiar to that part of <hi>Thessaly</hi> called <hi>Pthiotis,</hi> and thence <hi>Homer</hi> calls them properly <hi>Hellens</hi> which followed <hi>Achilles</hi> from thence; and it appears by <hi>Homer</hi> that <hi>there</hi> was a City there called <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> came, and this <hi>Hellen</hi> lived in <hi>Pthiotis.</hi> But although they were first in <hi>Pthiotis,</hi> yet they dayly increasing in numbers and power, by degrees they got all <hi>Thessaly</hi> into their hands, of which one part was called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; afterwards under <hi>Dorus</hi> the son of <hi>Hellen</hi> they conquered <hi>Hestiaectis,</hi> that part of <hi>Thessaly</hi> which lyes under the mountains <hi>Ossa</hi> and <hi>Olympus;</hi> from thence they were beaten back by the <hi>Cadmeans</hi> into <hi>Pindus,</hi> where the <hi>Greeks</hi> were first called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as <hi>Herodotus</hi> tells us; from hence they went into <hi>Dryopis,</hi> and thence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Pelopponesus,</hi> and there had the name <hi>Dorians;</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their coming hither, they had first secured themselves of <hi>Hellens</hi> lying between <hi>Thessaly</hi> and <hi>Pelopponesus,</hi> and there they dispossest the <hi>Pelasgi</hi> in all the <hi>Attickregion;</hi> who were now forced to <hi>submit</hi> or to <hi>fly;</hi> they who submitted, as most of them did, were incorporated into the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and became one people with them, and so by degrees lost that former <hi>language</hi> which was peculiar to themselves and wholly distinct from the <hi>Greek</hi> tongue. That the <hi>Hellens</hi> did thus gradually come into <hi>Pelopponesus,</hi> is evident from the names of <hi>people</hi> and <hi>placts</hi> common to <hi>Thessaly</hi> and <hi>Pelop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponesus</hi>
                  <pb n="565" facs="tcp:53276:304"/>
which came from hence, that though the <hi>Greeks</hi> left the Cities behind them, yet they carryed most of the names along with them. Thus the <hi>Achaei, Ionians,</hi> and <hi>Aeolians,</hi> and <hi>Dorians</hi> in <hi>Pelopponesus</hi> came from those of the same <hi>names</hi> in <hi>Thessaly;</hi> and so likewise the names of these follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>regions</hi> and <hi>Cities</hi> were common to both, as <hi>Ellopia, Estiaea, Eretria,</hi> and <hi>Oropos, Graia, Larissa, Psophis, Iton, Occalia</hi> and very many others <hi>Salmasius</hi> seems to be of opinion, that the <hi>Pelasgi</hi> never used any language distinct <note place="margin">
                     <hi>De Hellen. p.</hi> 315.</note> from the <hi>Hellens;</hi> but besides that it is directly contrary to the testimony of <hi>Herodotus,</hi> the arguments he produeeth for it are very weak. The first is because the <hi>Pelasgi</hi> that went into <hi>Italy,</hi> did use the <hi>Greek tongue,</hi> from their calling <hi>Agylla Caere,</hi> from <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> a word pronounced from one on the walls; and because the <hi>Arcades</hi> used only the <hi>Greek</hi> language in the <hi>Aeolian Dialect,</hi> which <hi>Evander</hi> carryed with him into <hi>Italy,</hi> and from which most of the <hi>old Roman language</hi> was derived. But doth not <hi>Herodotus</hi> expresly say, that after the mixture between the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Pelasgi</hi> these by degrees lost their own proper <hi>language</hi> and made <hi>use</hi> of the common <hi>Greek tongue?</hi> Yet afterwards too it is evident from <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus</hi> in some places, as at <hi>Crotona,</hi> they did use a language different from the <hi>Greek.</hi> His other argument is, <hi>that the names of the eldest persons mentioned were originally Greek;</hi> but this is expresly denyed by <hi>Strabo</hi> who makes the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary one of his strongest arguments, that the <hi>Barbarians</hi> did anciently inhabit <hi>Greece;</hi> and instanceth in <hi>Cecrops, Codrus, Aeoius, Cothus, Drymas, Crimanus.</hi> Thus we have abundantly proved against the common opinion, that <hi>Greece</hi> was not first peopled by the <hi>Hellens,</hi> or the posterity of <hi>Elisa,</hi> although these did afterwards come to the full possession of <hi>Greece.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It remains that we shew whence these <hi>Pelasgi</hi> came, and of whose posterity they were, and what the <hi>language</hi> was <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 13.</note> which was used by them. He that gave the name to this people according to the <hi>Grecian fables,</hi> was one <hi>Pelasgus,</hi> which none will wonder at among them, whose constant custom it was, (partly by reason of their <hi>Ignorance</hi> of the true account of their names, and partly by their <hi>pride</hi> that

But this I will not only suppose, but offer these probabilities for the proof of it, the first is, the <hi>agreement</hi> of the ancient <hi>Greek</hi> language with the <hi>Hebrew</hi> in many of its primitive words; and here we have a most rational and probable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count given of it; which is the <hi>Greeks</hi> mixing with the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasgi,</hi> and both coming to be one people, they must needs retain many of the old words used by the <hi>Pelasgi</hi> in their
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:53276:306"/>
Greek language; which are evidently of an <hi>Eastern</hi> extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, the ground of which cannot with such probability be fetched from <hi>Cadmus</hi> and the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> because it is not so easie admission of a forraign Language after the <hi>perfection</hi> of their own, unless by long tract of time, or great numbers overrunning the former people, neither of which can be so truly affirmed of <hi>Cadmus</hi> and his company; for they were soon driven out of <hi>Greece,</hi> he himself ending his dayes in <hi>Illyricum;</hi> neither was their spread so large as that of the <hi>Pelasgi,</hi> who were before possessors of the Countrey; and it is continually seen how impossible it is for any Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, as the <hi>Greeks</hi> were, to bring their own language so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a place, where some of the former people are suffered to live, and not to retain many of their old <hi>words</hi> among them, and so make the Language mixt of both, as it is in all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons conquerd by the <hi>Romans;</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> not being purely spoken by any, but corrupted with a <hi>mixture</hi> of the sormer Language in use among them. The second Argument is from the different <hi>pronunciation</hi> and <hi>dialects</hi> in <hi>use</hi> in the <hi>Greek Language;</hi> of which no account so likely can be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as the mixture with different <hi>Language.</hi> This is most evident in the <hi>Dorick Dialect;</hi> for the <hi>Dorians</hi> inhabiting probably where most of the <hi>Pelasgi</hi> had been, their <hi>pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation</hi> and <hi>dialect</hi> comes the nearest to the <hi>Eastern</hi> of any of the <hi>Greeks:</hi> For in the <hi>Dorick dialect</hi> the <gap reason="foreign">

The third Argument is from the <hi>remainders</hi> of the <hi>Eastern tongues</hi> in those places, especially where the <hi>Pelasgi</hi> had been.

For in so great variety (as suddenly happened) of <hi>languages</hi> in the world, it cannot be conceived but such things which might be preserved in some uniform manner, had all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons used the same <hi>language,</hi> would through the diversity of <hi>Idiomes</hi> and <hi>properties</hi> of several tongues be strangely altered and disguised, as will appear afterwards. This <hi>alteratisn</hi> of <hi>languages</hi> in the world upon the confusion of tongues at <hi>Babel,</hi> brought as great a confusion into the original tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as it did among those who were the designers of that work.</p>
               <p>And because this <hi>subject</hi> of the <hi>Original</hi> and cause of this diversity of <hi>languages</hi> among men, doth both tend to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain <note place="margin">

Chiefly on this account, because it is pretended that such a <hi>confusion</hi> is needless which is delivered in <hi>Scripture,</hi> for the producing such diversities of languages, which would arise through meer length of time, &amp; the varieties of <hi>Climes</hi> and <hi>customs</hi> in the world. But if we only speak concerning the sense of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> about it, the enquiry is of greater difficulty then at first view it seems to be. For it is pretended that <hi>Moses</hi> nowhere speaks of a <hi>diversity</hi> of <hi>languages,</hi> as we understand it, but <note place="margin">

<pb n="580" facs="tcp:53276:312"/>
they had different <hi>apprehensions</hi> of it: some thinking it sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified one thing and some another: as <hi>Iulius S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

As if one called for <gap reason="foreign">

But supposing no such division of <hi>languages</hi> there, yet after their <hi>dispersion,</hi> which might be caused by the former <hi>confusion,</hi> by the different <hi>Laws, rites,</hi> and <hi>customs, commerce,</hi> and <hi>trading,</hi> and tract of <hi>time,</hi> there would have risen a division of their several tongues. But if there were such a <hi>division</hi> of <hi>tongues</hi> miraculously caused there (that as it is commonly said, all those who were of the same language, went together in their several companies) whence comes it to pass, that in their <hi>dispersisn</hi> we read of several families dispersed, which used the same language after their dispersion? as all the sons of <hi>Canaan</hi> mentioned, <hi>Gen.</hi> 10. 15, 16, 17, 18. used the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanitish</hi> tongue: in <hi>Greece, Iavan</hi> and <hi>Elisa</hi> had the same language. In <hi>Aegypt Misraim</hi> and <hi>Pathrusim;</hi> in <hi>Arabia</hi> the sons of <hi>Ioctan</hi> and <hi>Chus;</hi> in <hi>Chaldaea Aram</hi> and <hi>Uz</hi> the inhabitants of <hi>Syria, Mash</hi> of <hi>Mesopotamia, Nimrod</hi> of <hi>Babylon, Assur</hi> of <hi>Assyria:</hi> whence comes it to pass if their several tongues were the <hi>cause</hi> of their <hi>dispersion,</hi> that these several <hi>heads</hi> of <hi>families</hi> should use the same <hi>tongue?</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other <hi>reason</hi> against the common opinion, is this, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ch seems to have a great deal of force in it. If <hi>tongues</hi> were divided at <hi>Babel,</hi> as it is imagined; whence was it, that the nearer any <hi>Nation</hi> lay to those who had the primitive lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage the <hi>Ebrew,</hi> they did participate more of that <hi>tongue</hi> then those who were more remote, as is plain in the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans, Canaanites, Greeks,</hi> and others? whereas if their <hi>lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages</hi> were divided at <hi>Babel,</hi> they would have retained their own language as well as others. This very argument pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed so far with the learned <hi>Is. Casaubon,</hi> as appears by his <hi>adversaria</hi> on this subject (published by the learned Dr. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Diatrib. de</hi> L. <hi>Heb. p.</hi> 17, 18.</note> his son) as to make him leave the common opinion, and to
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:53276:312"/>
conclude the several <hi>tongues</hi> to be only some <hi>variations</hi> from the <hi>Ebrew,</hi> but yet so as many new words were invented too. Hence he observes that the <hi>Asiatick Greeks</hi> came nearer to the <hi>Ebrew</hi> then the <hi>European.</hi> And if this opinion hold true, it is the best foundation for deriving other <hi>languages</hi> from <note place="margin">

Thus we see there is no agreement in mens minds concerning the division of <hi>tongues</hi> at <hi>Babel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But having set down this opinion with its reasons, I shall <note place="margin">

And it seems to be grounded on these reasons. 1. That had it been left to mens own <hi>choice,</hi> there cannot be a sufficient reason assigned of the diversity of <hi>languages</hi> in the world. For there being one <hi>language</hi> originally in the world, whereby men did represent their <hi>conceptions</hi> to one another; we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not imagine that men should of themselves introduce so great an <hi>alteration,</hi> as whereby to take off that necessary society and converse with each other, which even nature it self did put men upon.

But to this it is said, <hi>that the long tract of time and diversity of customs might alter the language.</hi> I grant it <hi>much,</hi> but not <hi>wholly;</hi> and they would only therein differ in their languages, wherein their <hi>customs</hi> differed; so that there would remain still such an <hi>agreement</hi> as whereby they might understand each other; which it will be hard to find in many of the eldest <hi>languages.</hi> As for the <hi>length of time,</hi> though that doth alter much in reference to <hi>words</hi> and <hi>phrases,</hi> in which that of <hi>Horace</hi> holds true, <hi>Multa renascentur quae jam cecidere,</hi> &amp;c.

But that which I think deserves well to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidered
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:53276:313"/>
is this, that the greatest <hi>alteration</hi> of <hi>languages</hi> in the world hath risen from <hi>Colonyes</hi> of Nations that used another language; and so by the mixture of both together the language might be much altered; as the <hi>Hebrew</hi> by the <hi>Chaldees</hi> in <hi>Babylon;</hi> the <hi>Spanish, Italian</hi> and others by t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>Aegyptians</hi> were not backward to testifie their respect to <hi>Ioseph,</hi> as appears by <hi>Pharoahs</hi> rewarding of him; now it was the <hi>custom</hi> of the <hi>Aegyptians</hi>
                  <pb n="597" facs="tcp:53276:320"/>
to preserve the <hi>memories</hi> of their great Benefactors by some <hi>symbols</hi> to <hi>posterity;</hi> which were at first intended only for a <hi>civil use,</hi> although they were after abused to <hi>Superstition</hi> and <hi>Idolatry.</hi> 3.

               <argument>
                  <p>Concerning matters of pure divine revelation in Scripture: the terms of Salvation only contained therein. The ground of the disesteem of the Scriptures is tacite unbelief. The Excellency of the Scriptures manifested as to the matters which God hath revealed therein. The excellency of the discoveryes of Gods nature which are in Scripture. Of the goodness and love of God in Christ. The suitableness of those discoveries of God to our natural notions of a Deity. The necessity of Gods making known himself to us in order to the regulating our conceptions of him. The Scriptures give the fullest account of the state of mens souls, and the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which are in them. The only way of pleasing God dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in Scriptures. The Scriptures contain matters of greatest mysteriousness, and mest universal satisfaction to mens minds. The excellency of the manner wherein things are revealed in Scriptures, in regard of clearness, authority, purity, uniformity, and perswasiveness. The excellency of the Scriptures as a rule of life. The nature of the duties of Religion and the reasonableness of them. The greatness of the encouragements to Religion contained in the Scriptures The great excellency of the Scriptures, as containing in them the Cove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
