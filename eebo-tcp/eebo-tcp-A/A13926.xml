            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>I am glad to see you so strong in the Lord, deare brother, and most willingly I will do that you request; but I must tell you by the way, that you haue done full euill, in not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king your will in the time of your health, seeing your old age so to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, that by the course of nature your daies could not be long: and if God should haue taken you away so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainely, as he doth in mercy some of his deare seruants, then should you thereby haue bene perhaps the Author of bitter strife and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion amongst your children; which is one of the things so abhominable &amp; hateful in Gods sight,<note place="margin">Prou. 6.19.</note> namely to raise contentions among brethren. And how you can auoide that yet, though God in mercy do giue you time in this your sicknesse to make your will, I know not, except your children be

the better disposed, and louing one to another, and you distribute so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually vnto them, that none of them haue cause to finde fault. But if in the time of your health you had dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of your goods and lands, then should you haue seene perchance, whether any would haue bene dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content with your equall distributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and they that had without iust cause, bene offended, might by you haue bene depriued of that which otherwise they should haue had. The feare of which would haue bene haply one motiue to moue them all, to haue bene content. But seeing it is otherwise, I will aduise you what is best yet to do in this case: first, you shall do well to call all your children together, and such else of your friends as you would haue present.</p>

               <p>Yea surely for these causes prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally,

first, that all of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might haue your blessing with incouragement in all good and Christian duties, wherin they haue walked; and reprehension with admonition, for their euils. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, for the auoiding of strife, and the establishing of peace and loue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them; which is a thing much to be respected amongst all, much more of a father amongst his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Thirdly, all that a father shall say at that time to his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in reproouing and rebuking of sin, &amp; allowing and commending of vertue, shall be the more deeply imprinted in the hearts of his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, being so sole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nly done, and the last words, as it were, of their father, vpon his death-bed: yea we see often that they which are farre from being godly disposed, do by the light of nature, much respect the things giuen them in charge by their father vpon his death-bed. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is meete that all your children
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:19989:7"/>
should be present, and all this must be performed, by you with fatherly wisedome and iudgement without partiality: not punishing a small fault, with a great punishment, nor a great fault with a small punishment, but proportionable to the offence must the punishment be; for so doth God alwaies deale with his children, and so must earthly fathers with their children. A notable president of all this we haue, in that holy Patriarch Iacob and his sonnes, wherewith I know you are well acquainted. Gen. 49.</p>

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:19989:7"/>
for that, as before is said, they should be bettered, by their fathers last sharp reprehension, if any thing will preuaile with them.

Nay my selfe, though (I thanke God for his mercy) I haue learned some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing out of Gods word in all my dayes, little considered the weight of this poynt, as now I do see plainely by your godly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions.

               <p>It is indeede too much neglected, neither do any almost teach it, or write it effectually, that so it might be learned by all as it ought. But one thing is yet behinde, whereof I haue not yet aduised you from the Lord, and that is this, namely your remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring the poore members of Iesus Christ (your poore neighbours:) for all that you shall do vnto such,<note place="margin">Mat. 25.</note> our Lord Iesus Christ doth esteeme it, as done vnto himselfe, yea if one be able to giue but a cup of cold water, and hauing bene charitable, as euery true

member of Christ is, and must be, in your life; you shall do well to testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie at the end, when you are going to giue vp your account to God, that you are not lesse louing, and pittifull to the poore, than you haue bene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.

to giue to Christ in his poore members, can iustly looke for no part of that blessing of Christ which you menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned before. And most wofull is this, me thinkes, against all those, who haue little or no feeling of their poore distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed brethren. And alas, this is the most common charity now a daies, euen that which Saint Iames reproueth so sharpely: Go warme your selues,</hi>

               <p>We must do good vnto all, but especially to them that are of the houshold of faith: but those that are not yet called we must loue, as our selues, for they are our neighbours,

euen all men and women: as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the Samaritan doth nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly set forth; and therfore in distresse ought to be relieued. And who knoweth whether our kindnesse, and good example, as also Christian admonition, may not be an occasion to win them to Christ? Therefore what you will giue that way, commit the distribution thereof to some Christian neighbour, with generall direction from you, and in particular, if you know any poore Christians that haue more neede then other; or to whom by any speciall band, you are more neere then to other, them in particular you may nominate your selfe: and you may also referre the like disposing of some, to your Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian friends or ouerseeers, vnto such particular distressed Christians as they know stand in neede, besides the generall.</p>
