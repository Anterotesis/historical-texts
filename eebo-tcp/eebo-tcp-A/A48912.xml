            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>Loſing the dear Aſſociates of their Bed;</l>
            <l>But deeply cut with an afflicting Senſe,</l>
            <l>Let your ſad hearts their purple Streams diſpenſe.</l>
            <l>Hang down your wond'ring heads, and bluſhing ſhow</l>
            <l>Your deep amazement by your ſinking Brow.</l>
            <l>With Silence, Horror, and Attention wait,</l>
            <l>Whil'ſt my ſad Muſe doth the dire Tale relate.</l>
            <l>My Tongue-ty'd Muſe, which ne're before could ſpeak,</l>
            <l>Yet now muſt open, or my Heart will break.</l>

            <l>The diſmal Cauſe of my Poetick Flame.</l>
            <l>Fain I would ſpeak, and eaſe me, of my Pain,</l>
            <l>But my great Horror ſtrikes me dumb again.</l>
            <l>What Iron Tongue can with due Temper ſpeak,</l>

            <l>With awful Reverence and Terror ſtruck,</l>

            <l>Hell and <hi>ROME</hi>'s Emiſſaries did Combine</l>

            <l>
               <hi>ROME</hi> could not bear to have that Jewel loſt,</l>
            <l>Which to her thirſty Coffers brought in moſt.</l>
            <l>And ſince our Land forſook the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Yoke,</l>
            <l>And wiſely from her Curſed Fetters broke.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Rome,</hi> to recover her delightful Gain,</l>
            <l>Many a Plot did ſecretly maintain,</l>
            <l>To bring this Nation to her Foot again:</l>
            <l>But fruſtrated in ev'ry ſuch Deſign,</l>
            <l>By an o're-ruling Providence Divine,</l>
            <l>Your MAJESTY exalted to the Throne,</l>
            <l>Secure ſhe ſtood in ſo endear'd a Son,</l>
            <l>So firmly bound to her Religion.</l>
            <l>Who (when a Subject) to her firmly ſtood,</l>

            <l>And publickly avow'd the Holy Cauſe,</l>
            <l>Againſt the higheſt Int'reſt, and known Laws.</l>
            <l>What cou'd ſhe doubt of ſuch a zealous Son,</l>

            <l>Nor mention what it was ſhe did intend,</l>
            <l>When to her Arts ſhe did our Monarch bend.</l>
            <l>But humbly, and with bleeding heart implore,</l>
            <l>His MAJESTY would take her Part no more:</l>
            <l>But (having bought at moſt expenſive Rates</l>
            <l>This deareſt Eye-ſalve) would perceive her Cheats:</l>
            <l>Wiſely reflecting into what a ſtate</l>
            <l>Her Treacheries have brought the JUST and GREAT:</l>
            <l>And under the ſpecious Name Religion,</l>
            <l>The happieſt MONARCH of the Earth undone.</l>

            <l>Which perpetrates the worſt of Villanies,</l>

            <l>See then, <hi>O Royal Sov'reign,</hi> ſee</l>

            <l>And reſolutely break her ſlaviſh Yoke:</l>
            <l>Say but that healing word, and when 'tis ſpoke,</l>
            <l>Let the loſt Whore perceive ſhe is forſook.</l>
            <l>Tell all Your bleeding Nation, tell the VVorld,</l>

            <l>The ſev'ral Facts ſhe would have had You done.</l>
            <l>Nothing o'recomes like Free Confeſſion.</l>
