            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and had great pleasure to liue so styll, and so wold haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, had it not bene that by Gods goodnesse she myght in lawfull marriage haue issue, (for which it is our bounden duetie earnestlye to praye) to thintent y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all her louyng sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes therby myght be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, &amp; the whole realme pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued in peace and quietnes.

<pb facs="tcp:18060:86"/>
hym to put her in mynde of suche one, as his glory might be anaunced by, and all her subiectes haue good cause to reioyce in. For as for worldly pleasure, whice folkes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly take in marriage, she nothinge passed: but her care was only to marry with such one, as myght throughe his singuler vertue please god, through his greate wisdome helpe well to gouerne this realme, and for his noble ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage be occasion of muche ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and quietnesse to our countrye.

<pb facs="tcp:18060:116"/>
the anoynted of God.
For so shal he disappoynt the deuil of his purpose, and saue him selfe from peryll of perishinge. And yf the deuil wil not thus cease (most louyng countrye men) but still stirre vp oure hartes to make rebellion, yet lette vs consider, that what cause soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he putteth in our heades, and laboreth to make vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue, that it is a good cause, we oughte neuer to beleue hym, both because that whatsoeuer he telleth vs<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> it is but a lye, by reason that he is the father of lyinge, and also that no cause is there at all, for whyche we maye iustelye make commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Yea and thys wil I saye, that yf euer we Englyshe men had
<pb facs="tcp:18060:116"/>
cause to be quiete, and to loue oure heade and ruler, nowe is the tyme. For those that be poore, yf they be by anye manne wrongfully oppressed, the Queenes pleasure is, that they shall haue iustice, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer their right. Or if they be riche, she is gladde of it, and wisheth that they, (so that it be by honest meanes) waxe more riche. If they be gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, or men of honour<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> they may be assured to continue in their state and degre, so that they do their duetye to god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde, and beare alwayes a faythfull hart to their prince. But some percase wil say, that iustice is not so dewly execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as it oughte to be: And that moneye and frendshippe
<pb facs="tcp:18060:117"/>
maketh of a badde matter a good, and of a good matter a badde. And that there is as much bribery, and takynge of rewardes (which is a pitifull hearyng) vsed nowe a dayes, as euer was.</p>
            <p>All thys maye be true, and yet the Prince nothing to be blamed therfore. For seynge y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> her grace hath so often exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all suche, as be in aucthori<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie &amp; office to minister iustice without partialitie, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware alwaye of takynge of bribes, yf any cause be vniustly determined, or any bribes ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for anye matter<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> she is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged thereof, and the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den lyeth vpon their backes, that is the ministers of iustice, and whose handes are reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyshed
<pb facs="tcp:18060:117"/>
wyth brybes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes.</p>
            <p>Therefore sithen that her hyghnesse trauayleth by all meanes to see euerye man to haue his righte, and doubteth not by Goddes helpe, yf God sende her life, to redresse thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that are out of order, and so to prouide, that all her lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge subiectes shall haue a prosperous and happie life vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der her, me thynke, euery one of vs shuld most hartelye loue her, wyshe her longe lyfe and good helthe<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> praye God to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siste her, and to sende her strength to vanquishe her ene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mies, and not to hate her, not to wishe her death, not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell agaynste her, not to seke her bloud, as men of late haue

               <p>Doth she not seke alwayes possible to bringe al those that be infected wyth heresye, to their deare mother agayne, y<hi rend="sup">‚Ä¢</hi> spouse of Christ, whome they had of late vtterly forsaken? Doth she not study all that she can to saue vs both body and soule? Yea and she hartelye wisheth euerye one of vs as well to fare<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> as she would her selfe.

Besyde this she by all meanes seeth the good lawes of this Realme to be duely obserued. She gyueth also most straight charge to al her officers to execute iustice.
<pb facs="tcp:18060:119"/>
She monisheth all them that be in aucthoritie, to beware of briberye, &amp; taking of reward. And she exhorteth all the clar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gie of this Realme to be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in doynge their dueties.

What wold we haue her highnes to do? She laboreth for vs, she lyueth for vs, and she ruleth for vs. For elles why shoulde her grace take the vntolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble paynes, that she dothe, but for vs? She breaketh many a slepe, that we may slepe quiet lye. She taketh muche care &amp; anguishe to auoyde vs from care. She tosseth and turmoy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leth

Or why should she not wishe to be gone out of thys miserye, and to be at rest wyth our Lord &amp; sauiour Iesu Christe<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> but that she woulde fayne, or she wente hence, deliuer vs from mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? Her highnes is appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by almightye God to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne vs. For what purpose I praye you? To seke her owne pleasure, to satisfie her owne lustes, to studye for her owne priuate welthe? No no she knoweth that God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth of her, and of all Princes
<pb facs="tcp:18060:120"/>
likewise, that they fede the people, that they norish them, that they promote the good, and punishe the badde: That they loue their subiectes, and loke diligently to them. If we dyd considre, what greuouse cares, what broken slepes, what fearfull dreames, what doubtefull counseylles, what stormes and troubles she hath for our sakes, we shoulde haue iust cause hartelye to thanke her grace, that she wold leaue the quiete state of lyfe, that she was in before, and take thys vnquiete state vpon her, that she nowe lyueth in.</p>

they must nedes haue women which they called wyues. For it is not possible (sayd they) for a man to lyue chaste.

               </gap>. psalme, which is thus muche to say in Englishe.
<q>I haue determined with my selfe, that I will so directe and order my life, that I do not offende wyth my tounge: departed, and wolde in no wise heare the seconde verse, but sayd, that one verse was sufficient, if he could prac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tise it in dede.</q>
After that when he had taught hym this verse,
<pb facs="tcp:18060:165"/>
dyd rebuke hym, because he hadde not sene hym nowe the space of syxe monethes, he aun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>swered<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> that he hadde not as yet in dede learned y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> verse of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Psalme.

I haue scarcely learned to practise it. Wherby it well appeareth, that a man maye learne as much vpon one day, at one sermon, as he can well learne perfytly to practise in a whole yeare. Wherfore I haue oftentymes muche mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayled at vs Englishe men of late, that we came to the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che at the tyme of our English

seruice to heare only, and not to pray our selfes. By meanes wherof many folkes are so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ured, that they can hardlye frame them selfes as yet to pray in the churche, which, as our sauiour sayth is the house of prayer.<note place="margin">Mat. 21.</note> And moste mete were it for folkes comming to the churche, to pray earnestly them selfes, and both to think vpon their synnes. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they haue offended their lorde god, and to be sory for them, and to desire god to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyue them, yea and beside to gyue hym harty thankes for all his benefites bestowed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and to beseche hym to assiste them with his grace agaynst the assaultes of their aduersary the deuil. For thus
<pb facs="tcp:18060:166"/>
ought men to spende the holy daye, and thus ought they to bestow their tyme in the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che of God, when they come thyther. For what dyd Anna the doughter of Phanuell, (who had lyued with her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande .vij. yeares, and after his death continued widowe, tyll she was foure score and foure yeares old, and so died) is it not written of her by S.

The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>gelist telleth not, that there she was occupied in hearynge, but that she was occupied in praying.

they remembre it<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> yet they do not practise it: and one howre spente in practisynge, is more worthe to vs, then twentye spent in hearynge. Therefore when they come to Churche, and heare the priestes, who sayeth common prayer for all the whole multitude, albeit they vnderstand them not, yet yf they be occupied in godlye prayer them selfes, it is suffici<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ent for them. And lette them not so greatly passe for vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standynge, what the priestes saye, but trauayle them selfes in feruent praying, and so shal they hyghly please God. Yea and experience hath playnlye taught vs, that it is much bet<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter for them not to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande the common seruice of
<pb facs="tcp:18060:167"/>
the Churche, then to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande it, because that when they heare other prayinge with a lowde voyce in the lan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>guage, that they vnderstand, they are letted from prayer them selfe, and so come they to suche a slacknes and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in prayinge, that they at lengthe (as we haue well sene of late dayes) in maner pray not at al.

that it was lawfull for a man in a Christen commen welth, without imposition of ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>des of any bishop to preache open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.

And thus haue you heard (most entyerly beloued contrye men) a breue rehersal of the perillouse and pestilent fruites that our new doctrine hath brought forth here in our contrye these few yeares last passed. By means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Christes true religion hath

Which truly I am right sory to recite But (as Iosephus sayth) I shuld do my contry smal plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to leaue those miseryes vntouched in my wordes, that it hath suffred in dede. If a manne shulde likewise recken vp the great incommodities, that hath chaunsed to the com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>men welthe of this realme by reason of the same doctrine, he shuld be very longe and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>case tedious to. But thus muche will I say, and euery man, that is aboute thirtye yeares olde, shall witnes with me, that I say true, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we forsoke y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole catho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>like churche of god, and made vs a seueral and priuate chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che of our owne, our commen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>welthe

As for to pull downe churches and chappels, they counted it a good pastime. And they were sore agreued with images, that if they se a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny picture eyther in walles or in glase windowes. they wold vtterly deface it. But at leng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the when the citye was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, both the lewde king, that they had made, and all his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herentes, were taken withal, and burned at a stacke, and so receaued the reward of their wicked rebellion.
