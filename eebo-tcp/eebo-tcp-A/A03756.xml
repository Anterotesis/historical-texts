            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>Sleape once hath skarse the powre to close my wéeping wakefull eyes,</l>
               <l>In whiche longe lothsome nightes, my Pen full oft I blame,</l>
               <l>For that the wofull state of me t'indite he doth not frame:</l>
               <l>Whose youthfull yeares and daies, by nature were not ripe,</l>
               <l>When cruell fate them cleane cut of, at one most soden wipe:</l>
               <l>Though life do yet remaine to length my time in teares,</l>
               <l>Whiche fliyng fame seemes not to cease, to blow in each wightes eares,</l>

               <l>And eke a carefull minde, more troublously itost,</l>
               <l>Then is the shipman on the Sea, in daunger nie the lost:</l>

               <l>Which now longe times haue béen, so tossed with vnrest,</l>

               <l>Such prouidence for man, doth Fortune oft procure,</l>
               <l>When smilingly she séemes to trayne, with bayte of golden leure,</l>
               <l>By meane wherof she will, a canckred poyson lay,</l>
               <l>Full closely coucht in pleasant bayte, with that poore soule to tray,</l>
               <l>As I but lately tried, who doth her bayts so taste,</l>
               <l>That secretly I sup the smarts, whiche caufe me pine and waste:</l>

               <l>for lost of time in golden youth, this is the tried gaine.</l>
               <l>For toyling paines and labours longe, this fruitelesse endes that bee:</l>
               <l>alas this is the death of some, when Lordes ingrate they see,</l>
               <l>But cheefe when age, doth once appeare, that labour none they haue,</l>
               <l>the mistres cries what makst thou heare, be packing doting knaue:</l>
               <l>So are they like vnto the Dog in Hunt that runs his race,</l>
               <l>who hath in youth been well esteemde, and liuide in careles case,</l>
               <l>But when in age he weried is, that hunting all is past.</l>
               <l>go hange, they crie the cursed our, this is roward at last.</l>

This is the ende, this is rewarde for paines and lost of age:</l>
               <l>O learne yonge man that seruice then, in none inheritage.</l>
               <l>A signe of this of youth ill spent, an aged man am I,</l>
               <l>alas no refuge is for me, O death nowe let me die.</l>
               <l>O wretched state, O cruell course, O port of penurie,</l>
               <l>O pitte of pagnes, O pesilent race, O sincke of miserie,</l>

               <l>Retire my sonne this race to run, that life vnsertaine is,</l>

               <l>since seruing weights by dayly toyle, are praise of noble band,</l>
               <l>What is the state of noble troope, if saruants haue no powres,</l>
               <l>alone is knowen a princely porte, by traine of seruitoures?</l>
               <l>By seruice dew is well distinct, of state the right degrees:</l>
               <l>as seruants serue in hoping harts, and crouch with humble knees.</l>
               <l>Where are the men more courteous, then men of seruice free:</l>
               <l>what men are more of comely corps, then Courtly seruants be?</l>
               <l>Who knowes the course and trade of men, but seruants daily care?</l>
               <l>who are more feate or trim traind vp, then manerd seruants are?</l>
               <l>Who stronge or tall of personage, but men of seruants route?</l>
               <l>who beares the cares &amp; bront of wars, but seruants arms so stoute:</l>
               <l>What then of more necessitie, then seruitours full trewe:</l>
               <l>why then shall they haue ill rewards, in thend their states to rewe?</l>
