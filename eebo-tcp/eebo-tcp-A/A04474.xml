            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Erusinge a certaine booke lately set foorthe in the name of M. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge,
and weighinge the substance, and parcelles of the same, good
Christian Reader, I called to minde these woordes spoken sometime
by Socrates the Philosopher, touchinge his Accusers, in his owne defence before
the Iudges:<note place="margin">Plato in Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia Socratis.</note> 
               <hi>My Lordes, in vvhat sorte your affections haue been sturred vvith
mine Accusers eloquence, vvhile ye hearde them speake, I cannot tel. But vvel I
vvote, for mine ovvne parte, I mee selfe, vvhom it toucheth moste, vvas almost
persuaded to beleeue, that al, they saide, vvas true: yea, although it vvere against
mee selfe. So handesomely thei can tel their tale: and so likely, and so smoothely
they conueigh their maters. Euery vvorde, they spake, had appearance of truth.
And yet in good soothe they haue scarcely vttered one vvoorde of trueth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus then saide Socrates of his Accusers. Euen so may I say now of M. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.
For bothe in trueth of mater, and also in probabilitie of vtterance, they are
muche alike. Aristotle, touching the darckenesse, and doubtefulnesse of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
worldly thinges, saith thus, <hi>Quaedam falsa probabiliora sunt quibusda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
veris: Certaine fals heades (by meane of good vtterance) haue sometimes more
likelyhoode of Trueth, then Trueth it selfe.</hi> For Trueth is many times brought
in simple, and naked, in poore araye. But Falsheade must needes apparel, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiere
her selfe with al her furnitures. Thus, many times wee are deceiued, and
embrace Falsheade in steede of Trueth. And this is the miserie of the Simple.
For neither are they hable to teache them selues: nor haue they, where with to
discerne their teachers. There was neuer, neither errour so horrible, but the
Simple haue receiued it: nor poison so deadly, but the Simple haue dronken it. In
this sorte S. Hierome saithe,<note place="margin">Hieronym. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trae Luciferiae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos.</note> 
               <hi>Infidelitie vvas sometime published, emonge the
Simple, vnder the name of Faithe:</hi> And Antichriste shalbe adoured, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
in steede of Christe.</p>
            <p>Touchinge the state, and issue of the mater, where as I, vpon iust occasion of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
and onely in regarde of the trueth, sometime saide in great audience, that
in any of these cases here mooued, our Aduersaries are not hable to allege, either
any one sufficient clause, or sentence out of the Scriptures, Councels, or Ancient
Fathers, or any certaine vsage, or example of the primitiue Churche, M. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge
hath here alleged, and published, not onely one, or other, but, as he him self
saith, and as it is thought of many, great numbers of suche Authorities of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
Councelles, and Doctours, bothe Greeke, and Latine, and many anciente,
and euident examples to the contrary. The places are noted: the woordes are
cleare: It cannot be denied: and, as it is supposed, al the worlde is not hable to
answeare it.<note place="margin">

                  </gap>
               </note> It seemeth now an vndoubted trueth, that as wel these, as also al o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Doctrines, and Orders of the Church of Rome, haue beene deriued di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
from Christe him selfe, and his Apostles: and haue continued the space of
<pb facs="tcp:12563:3"/>
fifteene hundred, and thertie yeeres at the least. Therefore some haue wisshed,
my woordes had been more warily qualified, and vttered with more circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection.
Euen this is it, that Aristotle saide, <hi>The shevv of trueth beareth often
more likelyhoode, then truth it selfe.</hi> There is no way so easy, to beguile the
Simple, as the name, and countenance of Ancient Fathers. The Arian Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques
alleged for them selues the Ancient Father Origen: The Nestorian here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques
alleged the Councel of Nice: the Donatian Heretiques alleged S. Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian:
the Pelagian Heretiques alleged S. Ambrose, S. Hierome, and S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine:
Dioscorus the Heretique alleged Gregorius, Cyrillus, and Athanasius:
and complained openly in the Councel, euen in like sorte, and as iustly, as M.
Hardinge dooth now: <hi>Ego defendo dogmata Santorum patrum. Ego
illorum habeo testimonia, non obiter, nec in transcursu, sed in ipso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum

               </gap> muche more may
some others come in the name, and vnder the coloure of certaine Fathers.</p>
            <p>But, good Christian Reader, for thy better vnderstanding, least happily thou
be deceiued, it may please thee to know, that these Authorities, alleged here by
M. Harding, are neither new, nor strange, nor vnknowen to any man of meane
learning but haue beene bothe often brought in, and alleged by others, and also
weighed, and examined, and thorowly confuted longe a goe. In deede M. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

and yet not so much, nor suche, but it may easily be answeared, although not
with like eloquence, whereof in these cases there is no neede, yet at leaste with
more trueth. I trust, by indifferent conference hereof, thou shalt soone see

<pb facs="tcp:12563:3"/>
Kinge Agesilaus, when he vnderstoode his Enimies of policie, to coouer the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and weaknes of their bodies, had bomebasted, and embossed out their coates
with greate quarters, that they might seeme bigge, and mighty men, and that his
souldiers therewith were muche dismaide, after he had ouerthrowen, and slaine
them in the fielde, pulled of their coates, and stript them, and left them naked: and,
when he had caused his Souldiers to beholde the poore, lither, sclender, wearishe
bodies, nothing like that, they seemed before, then saide he vnto them: <hi>Lo, these
be they, of vvhom ye stoode so muche afraide: these be their greate bodies: these be
their mighty boanes.</hi> Euen so, good Reader, if thou stande in feare of these
M. Hardinges Authorities, and Argumentes, and thinke them terrible, and inuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible,
for that they are embossed, and wrought out by arte: take them, rippe them,
open them, searche them, weighe them, strippe them naked, shake them out, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
them with the places, from whence they were taken: consider the Causes,
and the Circumstances, what goeth before, what commeth after: marke the Storie
of the time: examine the Iudgemente of other Fathers: and thou shalt marueile,
wherfore thou stoodest so muche afraide, or euer thoughtest them to be inuincible.</p>
            <p>It were aboue al thinges to be desired of God, that his Heauenly Trueth might
passe foorth without these contrarieties, and quarrels of iudgementes: and many
godly wise men are muche offended, to see it otherwise. But thus it hath been euer
from the beginning. Cain was against Abel: Esau against Iacob: The Kinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Darkenesse was euer against the Kingedome of Light: The Scribes, and
Phariseis were greeued with Christe: Celsus, Prophyrius, Iulianus, Symmachus
were greeued with the Glorie of the Gospel. Christe him selfe is the stoane of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fense,
laide to the Resurrection, and ruine of many. But through these offenses,
and contentions the Trueth of God breaketh out, and shineth more glorious.</p>
            <p>Blissed therefore be the name of God, that hath offered this occasion. For I
haue no doubte in God, but of this necessarie conflicte, through his mercie, there
shal issue some sparkle, to the glorie of his holy name. For as Moses Rodde deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the Roddes of the Sorcerers, euen so wil the Trueth of God deuoure Errour.
Darkenesse cannot stande before the light. Tertullian saithe, <hi>Scriptura diuina

            <p>Notwithstanding, before he addresse him selfe to his seconde Booke, I would coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
him, first, to consider better the ouersightes, and scapes of his former Booke: and
further, to thinke, that, what so euer he shal write, it wil be examined, and come to
trial. And let him remember, it is not sufficient, to cal vs Sacramentaries, and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques:
or to condemne our Bookes for pelfe, and trasshe, and fardles of lies, before
he see them. For these thinges wil now no lenger goe for Argumentes. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
al thinges, let him write no moe Vntruethes: For thereof he hath sente vs ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
already: Let him nomore wreast, and racke the Scriptures: Let him nomore
neither misallege, nor mysconstrue, nor corrupte, nor alter the holy Fathers: Let him
nomore imagin Councels, and Canons, that he neuer saw: Let him nomore bring vs,
neither his Amphilochius, nor his Abdias, nor his Hippolytus, nor his Clemens, nor
his Leontius, nor any other like childishe forgeries: nor his Gheasses, nor his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
nor his Dreames, nor his Fables: Let him nomore bringe one thinge for
an other: And, to be shorte, let him bring no moe Contradictions in his owne tales,
nor be founde contrarie to him selfe. Otherwise, the more he striueth, the more he
bewraieth his owne cause.</p>

M. Hardinges Preface.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T misliketh you muche, M. Hardinge, that in so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and sundrie cases by mee mooued, wherin standeth the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
force of your Religion, I shoulde saie, You, and others of that
parte are vtterly voide, not onely of the Scriptures, but also of
the Olde Councelles, and Ancient Fathers, and that in suche an
Audience, I should so precisely, &amp; so openly discoouer the wantes,
and weakenesse of your side. And therefore, <hi>The greatter my heape riseth, the lesse,</hi>
saie you, <hi>is mine aduantage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereunto I may easily replie, The larger is mine Offer, the more wil your
discrete Reader mislike the insufficiencie of your Answeare: and the more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged
is your libertie, the lesse cause haue you to complaine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wise men,</hi> ye saie, <hi>woulde more haue liked greatter Modestie.</hi> Uerily, the men, that
you cal Wise, woulde haue thought it greattest Modestie, to haue dissembled, and
saide nothinge. But what may the same Wise menne thinke of your Modestie,
that hauinge so often made so large, and so liberal offers of so many Doctours,
are not hable in the ende to shewe vs one?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Neither looke wee so fiercely, nor shake wee the swearde so terribly,</hi> as you reporte vs.
This was euermore your, and your felowes special, and peculiar commendation:
Who bisides your fierce, and cruel lookes, and bisides the shakinge, and terroure of
your swearde, haue also hewen, and cutte, and slaine, and filled your handes with
the bloude of your Brethren.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, ye shoulde not take it in suche griefe, that, onely for distinctions
sake, by so Ciuile, and courteous a name wee cal you our <hi>Aduersaries.</hi> For, fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge
you armed with Swearde, and Fiere, and embrewed with our Bloude, wée
might wel haue spared you some other name. That I saide, Ye haue no suche
assurance of the Ancient Fathers, as ye haue borne vs in hande, and as your
frendes vpon your credite haue beléeued, I saide it not, neither of Ambition, as you
expounde it, nor of Malice: but forced thereto by your importunitie, and with great
griefe of minde.</p>
            <p>Therefore ye did mee the greatter wronge, to saie, <hi>I came vaunting, as Goliath, and
throwinge foorth my glooue, like a chalenger, and proclaiminge defiance to al the worlde.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In these woordes, M. Hardinge, Wise menne may finde some wante of your Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destie.
For, who so auoucheth the manifest, and knowen Trueth, and saieth, that
you bothe haue béene deceiued your selues, and also haue deceiued others, ought not
therefore to be called Goliath. And, notwithstandinge you haue aduentured
your selfe, to be the Noble Dauid, to conquere this Giante, yet for as muche as
ye haue neither Dauids slinge in your hande,<note place="margin">Extra. De Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitu. Licet.</note> nor Dauids stoanes in your scripp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>,
and therefore not likely to woorke greate maisteries, ye may not looke, that the
Ladies of Israel with their Lutes,<note place="margin">De Electio. &amp; Elect. potestate. Significasti. 9. quae. 3. Nemo.</note> and Timbrelles wil receiue you in triumphe,
or singe before you, <hi>Dauid hath conquered his tenne thousandes.</hi> He rather is Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liath,
that setteth his face againste the Heauens, and his foote in Emperours

these woordes into al the worlde,<note place="margin">De Maioritate, &amp; Obedientia: Vnam Sanctam.</note> 
               <hi>I cannot erre: I haue al lawes, bothe Spiritual, and
Temporal in my breaste: I am aboue as General Councelles: I may Iudge al men: but al the
worlde may not Iudge mee, bee I neuer so wicked: I am Kinge of Kinges, and Lorde of

               <hi>I am al, and aboue al: Al power

               <note place="margin">In Concil. Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran. Sub Iulio.</note> Ye knowe, whose woordes these bée,
<pb facs="tcp:12563:5"/>
by whom they are spoken, by whom they are defended, and to whom they are
applied. This séemeth to be the very expresse, and liuely Image of Goliath:
That Goliath, I saie, whom nowe you sée knockte in the foreheade, and fallinge
downe, not with force of worldly power, but onely with that litle roughe despiced
stoane of Goddes euerlastinge, and heauenly Woorde. Touchinge that moste
woorthy, and learned Father, sometime your Maister, D. Peter Martyr, whom
ye would séeme somewhat to commende, not for his Doctrine, from whiche you
haue so suddainely fallen awaie, but onely for his modestie: it cannot be doubted,
but he, beinge at Poissy in that woorthy assemblie, in the presence of the Kinge,
and of other the Princes, and Nobles of that Realme, bothe did, and spake, that
might stande with the trueth of the cause, and also might wel become his owne
personne. But beinge demaunded his iudgement in these cases, he would haue
answeared, euen as wee doo, and woulde muche haue marueiled, that any learned
man would saie the contrary. Not longe sithence ye made the Pulpites ringe,
that your Masse, and<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> al other your whole Doctrine, was assured vnto you by
Christe, and his Apostles, and that for the same ye had the vndoubted continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
and succession of fiftéene hundred yéeres, the consent of al the olde Councels,
Doctours, and Fathers, and al Antiquitie, and the Uniuersal allowance of al the
worlde. Thus ye doubted not then to saie, without feare of controlment of
God, or man. Many thousandes thought ye dealte simply, and woulde not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
them: and therefore were easily leadde to beleeue you.</p>
            <p>In this case Christian dewtie, and Charitie required, that the trueth, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie
of your tales shoulde be opened, that the simple mighte vnderstande, ye had
deceiued them, and that of al that your so large talke, and countenance of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie
you were, as you wel knowe, vtterly hable to auouche nothinge. Where
as it so muche offendeth you, that I shoulde so precisely auouche the Negatiue,
and require you to prooue your Affirmatiue, whereof ye woulde séeme so wel as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured,
it may please you to consider, that S. Gregorie writinge against Iohn the
Bishop of Constantinople, that had intitled him selfe the Uniuersal Bishop of the
whole world, reasteth him selfe likewise vpon the Negatiue. His woordes be these:

to vse this arrogante name: No Bishop of Rome euer tooke vpon him this name of
Singularitie.</hi>
               </hi> S. Augustine, when he had reckened vp al the Bishoppes of Rome,
before his time,<note place="margin">August. epis. 165.</note> added thereto by a Negatiue, <hi>In hoc ordine successionis nullus Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natista
Episcopus inuenitur: <hi>In this order of Succession there is founde no Bishop, that was
a Donatiste.</hi>
               </hi> Yet neither S. Augustine, nor S. Gregorie was euer condemned for
Goliath. By the like Negatiue, you, M. Hardinge, your selfe saie, although vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truely,
as ye doo many other thinges bisides, <hi>That neither M. Iuel, nor any one of his side
is hable to shewe,<note place="margin">In the 3. Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and in the 15. Diuision.</note> that the publique Seruice of the Churche in any nation, was euer for the space
of sixe hundred yeeres after Christe, in any other tongue, then in Greeke, or Latine.</hi> And yet
wée may not therefore cal you, either Goliath, or Thersites, or by any other like
vncourteous name. You saie, <hi>I take presumptuously vpon mee, to haue readde al thinges, and
to be ignorant of nothinge:</hi> onely bicause I saie, you in these cases can allege no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge.
And why so? Can no man discrie your wantes, and disclose your Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truethes,
without presumption? You say, ye haue the consent of al Doctours, of
al ages, and of al times, of your side, shal wee therefore saie, that you vaunte your
selfe of your knowledge? or, that you knowe al thinges, and are ignorante of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge?
You saie, <hi>Ye haue al the Doctours.</hi> I saie, and true it is, <hi>Ye haue not one
Doctoure.</hi> The difference of these saieinges standeth onely in this, that the one
is true, the other vntrue: That your Affirmatiue cannot be prooued: My Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
<pb facs="tcp:12563:5"/>
cannot bee reprooued. But, touchinge vaunte of readinge, and knowledge,
there is no difference.</p>
            <p>Howe be it, for as muche as, this Negatiue so muche offendeth you of our side,
let vs hardly turne it of your side: And let vs saie so, as it may bes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e like you, to
haue vs saie: That it cannot appeare, by any sufficient clause, or sentence, either
of the Scriptures, or of the Olde Doctours, or of the Ancient Councelles, or by
any Example of the Primitiue Churche, either, that the Prieste then receiued the
Holy Communion togeather with the people: or, that the Sacrament was then
ministred vnto the people vnder bothe kindes: or, that the publique Praiers were
euer saide in the Uulgare, or Knowen tongue: or, that the whole people thereto
saide, <hi>Amen,</hi> within the space of sixe hundred yéeres after Christe. Let vs saie
further, that Christe him selfe, and al his Apostles saide Priuate Masse, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
the Holy Sacramente seuerally alone: That al the Ancient Fathers mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred
the halfe Communion onely vnder One Kinde: That al the Common Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
were euerywhere saide in a strange Learned Tongue, vtterly vnknowen
vnto the People. This offer is frée, and liberal. And what can you desire more?
But perhaps it shameth you to saie so muche. For, al be it some of you haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
saide it, yet the vntrueth thereof is manifest, and sheweth it selfe.</p>
            <p>Onely ye wishe, <hi>I had vsed some greatter Modestie.</hi> And woulde you, that I

that yow your selfe sometime were that man, of whom Salomon speaketh: That
yow sometime were in a waie, that seemed right, and yet the ende thereof leadde
to damnation: That yow sometime bent your whole harte, and studie to deface the
Churche of God: That yow preached so many yeeres togeather directly contrary
to your conscience: That yow sometime witingly, and willingly, and of purpose,
and malice, deceiued Goddes people: That yow sometime were the Minister of

and the holy Apostles, and anciente Catholique Fathers haue trodden before vs.</p>
            <p>Touchinge your exhortation to humilitie, and the denieal of my learninge,
whiche, I trust, of your parte proceedeth from a meeke, and humble sprite, I maie
safely denie that thinge, that I neuer auouched. It cannot shame mee to saie, that
S. Hierome saide, <hi>Dicam illud Socraticum, Hoc tantùm scio, quòd nihil scio:<note place="margin">Hierony. in prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fa. in Abdiam.</note>
                  <hi>I wil saie, as Socrates sometime saide, This thinge onely I knowe, that I knowe nothinge.</hi>
               </hi>
In these cases, as I séeke no praise, so I feare no reproche. What so euer wante is
in mee, there be others, that can supplie it. How be it, I neuer vnderstoode, but
Ueritie, and Humilitie might wel stande togeather.</p>
            <p>Where yow saie, what so euer skil, or knowledge I haue, or had, I haue euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
bente it onely to the reproche, and sclaunder of the Churche, it is no greate
maisterie, M. Hardinge, to speake il. But I trust, God him selfe, that iudgeth
iustly, iudgeth otherwise. Yf there be in mee, I say not, any talente, but onely
any mite of a talente, my praier vnto God is, and euer was, it maie be bestowed
wholy to the honoure, and comforte of his Churche.</p>
            <p>And yet maie not yow, M. Hardinge, neither sette sutche stoare by your selfe,
nor so mutche abase, and discredite others, as though bisides yow, &amp; your felowes,
there were noman méete to be counted learned. When the Iewes, in contempte
of al others, boasted them selues to be the onely stocke, and Bloud of Abraham, S.
Paule by an humble kinde of presumption doubted not in al respectes to compare
with them in this wise:<note place="margin">2. Corin. 11.</note> 
               <hi>Hebrewes they be: and so am I. Israelites they be: and so am
I. The seede of Abraham they be: and so am I.</hi> Againe he saith, <hi>Thus doo I, and thus
wil I doo, that in the thinges, whereof they glorie, they maie be founde to be, as wee are.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I wil force this comparison no further. Sutche contention is but vaine. O
M. Hardinge, this saieinge is common vnto vs bothe: <hi>By the Grace of God wee are,
that wee are. O that his grace be not in vs in vaine.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Corin. 15.</note>
            </p>
            <p>For my parte, bothe at your requeste, and also without your requeste, I vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
denie my learninge. And touchinge my Bishoprike, yf that in any parte hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to gréeue you, I denie it too: I denie myne estimation: I denie my name: I
<pb facs="tcp:12563:8"/>
denie mée selfe. Onely the Faithe of Christe, and the Truethe of God I cannot
denie. Or with this Faithe, or for this Faithe, I truste, I shal ende. I cannot
withstande the Sprite of God. I cannot saie, the consente of al the Auncient Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique
Fathers was an heape of errours, and a linke of Heresies. Although
you, M. Hardinge, coulde denie al togeather at an instante, and vpon the suddaine,
yet beare with others, that cannot so easily doo the same.</p>
            <p>Touchinge D. Fisher, I scoffed neither at him, nor at any others. Onely I
laide out the imperfection of certaine their Argumentes: whiche if they were
weake, &amp; many waies faultie, the faulte was not mine: I made them not. D. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shers
Argumente was this:<note place="margin">Polydor. de In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent. rer. li. 8. c. 1.</note> 
               <hi>We are sure, there is Purgatorie: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Popes pardonnes
be good, and available.</hi> I shal be forced in perusinge your Booke, to disclose many like
infirmities, and folies in your Argumentes, M. Hardinge. Yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge
I wil not scoffe. But happy are you, that may cal vs <hi>Gospellers, Newe
Maisters, Patriarkes,</hi> and, I knowe not what, and to write, what you liste, without
scoffinge. In the ende of your foretalke, whiche is before the shewinge of your
Booke, ye thinke al the worlde singeth <hi>Sanctus, Sanctus,</hi> and receiueth you with
<hi>Ozanna.</hi> And therefore ye wil euery bodie to come, and subscribe. How be it, it
séemeth, this request is very suddaine &amp; out of season. You should first haue shewed
vs, bothe whereunto wée shoulde subscribe, and also your Authorities, and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
wherewith ye would force vs to subscribe. But y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> olde learned Father Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian

               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>Kinge Agesilaus, the better to embolden his Souldiers to the fight, with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
iuice wrote this woorde, <hi>Victorie,</hi> in the palme of his hande: and afterwarde
beinge at his Seruice, as the manner then of the Heathens was, he laide his hande
so written closely, &amp; secretely vpon the harte of the Sacrifice, &amp; so printed it with
the saide woorde, <hi>Victorie:</hi> and immediatly shewed the same vnto his Captaines,
and Souldiers, as if it had beene written by the Goddes. The simple Souldiers,
not vnderstanding this policie, and thinkinge, the whole mater had in deede béene
wrought by miracle, grewe full of courage, not doubtinge, but their Goddes, that
had written, <hi>Victorie,</hi> woulde also geue them <hi>Victorie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By like policie, and to like purpose, it séemeth, you, M. Hardinge, would beguile
your Reader: and, that you lacke in strength, woulde winne by policie: and, that you
wante in Reasons, woulde gaine in woordes: that the simple may thinke, you haue
the <hi>Victorie,</hi> bicause you haue written, <hi>Victorie,</hi> with your penne.</p>
            <p>But you are not yet equal with the credite of Pythagoras. It is not sufficient
for your scholars to say, <hi>Ipse dixit:</hi> M. Hardinge hath saide it. Euery man wil not
thinke it is so, bicause you can write it, or Printe it, or say, it is so. As for mée selfe,
I wil saie with S. Hierome, <hi>Cupio discere, &amp; Discipulum me profiteor, dummod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

doceant. <hi>I woulde faine learne, and make a vowe to be their Scholar, so they would teache
mee.</hi>
               </hi> Firste ye shoulde haue geuen vs leaue, to haue perused your whole Booke.
And when we had wel weighed your vntrue Allegations, your vaine Constructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
your Newe petite Doctours, your Corruptions, your Forgeries, your
Dreames, your Fables, and the huge multitude of your vntruethes, then hardly
ye shoulde haue called vs, to subscribe.</p>
            <p>How be it, M. Hardinge, this is no force sufficient to subdewe the world. It
was not thought, ye had benne so weakely appointed. It is not yenough for
yow, thus odiously to vpbraide vs in your anger, and to calle vs Newe Maisters,
<pb facs="tcp:12563:9"/>
and Heretiques. That lesson might haue serued you longe agoe, before ye were
espied. It behooueth yow now, to haue some stronger argumentes, specially figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge
against God.</p>
            <p>For my parte, notwithstandinge I were thorowly persuaded longe before,
yet am I nowe some deale the more satisfied by these your traueiles. For, touching
your wante of Scriptures, Councelles, Doctours, and Examples of the Primitiue
Churche, I am wel, and fully confirmed by the sclendernes of your proufes.</p>
            <p>And I doubte not, but some of these, that now be aboute you, beinge, I trust,
not frowardly carried awaie with wilful malice, but hauinge the feare of God, and
a reuerente zele to doo the best, although perhaps not knowledge sufficiente, to
iudge, what is best, after they shal vnderstande some parte of your dealinge herein,
wil by Goddes Grace beginne, somewhat to forethinke them selues of their iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
<note place="margin">Augustin. in Iohan. tract. 7.</note> &amp; to caste some doubtes of your credite. S. Augustine saith, <hi>Iuris forensis est,
vt qui in precibus mentitus sit, illi ne profit, quod impetrauit: <hi>The Lawe is this,
that, who so hath made a false suggestion, shal lose, what so euer he haue gotten by the same.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>O M. Hardinge, Credite without trueth, is no credite. Your woorke is ouer
weake: It hath no fundation: It cannot stande. Chrysostome telleth you,
<hi>Sutche is the Nature of Errour:<note place="margin">Chrysostom. de Laudibus Pauli hom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5.</note> It vadeth of it selfe, and wil comme to grounde

               <head>The B. of Sarisburie.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HERE</hi> appeareth smal hope that M. Hardinge wil deale plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the rest, that thus maketh his first entrie with a cauill.</p>
               <p>For where as the mater is known, and agreed vpon, it is
great folie to pyke quarell vpon the woorde. <hi>Euery Masse</hi> (saith
he) <hi>is common, and none priuate.</hi> If it be so, then hath he already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
fully on our syde. For if there be no priuate Masse at all,
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was there no priuate Masse in the primitiue Church, which
was my fyrst assertion.</p>
               <p>But M. Hardinge, as may be gathered by his manner of proofes, is not yet wel
resolued, neither what is priuate, nor what is Masse. For in the .22. article of
his booke, intreatynge of the accidentes of breade and wyne, to th'intent to auoyde
the grosse absurdities that followe Transubstantiation,<note place="margin">Pag. 182. b.</note> he saieth, <hi>These mattiers
were neuer taught in open audience, but priuately disputed in the schooles, and set abroade by learned
men in their priuate wrytinges.</hi> There he calleth y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> thynge <hi>priuate,</hi> that is disputed in
open audience, in the hearynge of fyue hundred, or moe, and is sette abroade to the
knowledge of the worlde: And here the thynge that is done by the priest and his
boye alone in a corner, he calleth <hi>common.</hi> Thus he maketh woordes to sounde what
him listeth,<note place="margin">M. Hardinge maketh co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon, priuate: and priuate, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon.</note> sometyme <hi>common</hi> to be <hi>priuate,</hi> sometyme <hi>priuate</hi> to be <hi>common</hi> at his
pleasure.</p>
               <p>And as touchinge Masse, sometyme he maketh it the Sacrifice: sometyme the
Communion: sometime the prayers: and so séemeth not yet wel to knowe, vpon
what grounde to stande.</p>
               <p>His fyrst reason is this: The Sacrifice of the priest is common, therefore the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:12563:14"/>
Masse is common.<note place="margin">These reasons be answeared af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde more at large.</note> Here might be demaunded, who gaue the priest authoritie, to
make this Sacrifice? and without authoritie how can he make it? But if his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
be common, why doeth he geue it these priuate tytles, This for the lyuinge:
This for the dead: This for a frende: This for him selfe?</p>
               <p>His second reason is this: It is a feast, and therefore it is common: and thus
he salu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>th one errour with an other. For if it be a feast, how is it receiued by one
alone? If it be receiued by one alone, howe can it séeme to be a feast? But he
saith, it is prepared for al. Uerely it is but smal prouision to serue so many. The
priest him selfe knoweth this is vntrue. He prepareth for him selfe, and not for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
He speaketh to him selfe, and not vnto the congregation: He receiueth him
selfe alone, and not with his brethren. Therefore in this respecte we must néedes
saye, the Masse is priuate, and not common.</p>
               <p>The thirde reason touchinge the wil of the Minister, is very vncertayne. For
neither can the priest by his willinge alter natures, or make that thinge common,
whiche is priuate: nor can any man certeinely knowe, what thinge the prieste
willeth. For what if his wil be to woorke Necromancie, or Sorcerie, as it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
of Pope Hildebrande? Or what if his wil be to poyson some bodie, as Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
the Emperour was poysoned in the communion bread:<note place="margin">Hermannus Contractus. Nicolaus Lyra in. 14. cap. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nielis.</note> Pope Uictor in the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice?
Or what if his wil be to woorke fayned miracles, as Lyra sayeth, many are
wrought in the open Churche by the priest to mocke the people. Doubtles if the
priestes wil may be knowen, either by his woordes, or by his doinges, or by his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture,
or by his prouision, or by the quantitie of his breade and wyne, or by his
whole vsage and practise, it may soone be séene, his wil is to make a priuate ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,
and not a common.</p>
               <p>These be very weake foundations to buylde vpon. Of the same M. Hardinge
might rather, and farre better haue geathered the contrarie. For if it be the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
sacrifice of the whole Churche, it shoulde be offered by the whole Churche, as
S. Ambrose saieth:<note place="margin">Ambro. 1. Cor. 11</note> 
                  <hi>Vt multorum oblatio simul celebretur: <hi>That the oblation of
many may be made togeather.</hi>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it be a common feast of the whole Churche, it shoulde be receiued commonly
of the whole churche.<note place="margin">Hieron. 1. Cor. 11</note> And therefore S. Hierome sayeth. <hi>Dominica ccena omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
debet esse communis. <hi>The lordes supper must be common to al,</hi>
                  </hi> and that not for
these simple shiftes that M. Hardinge and his fellowes haue diuised. S. Hieromes
reason is this: <hi>Quia dominus omnibus Discipulis, qui aderant, aequaliter tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ta. <hi>Bycause the lorde gaue the Sacramentes equally to al the Disciples that were
present.</hi>
                  </hi> These woordes be plaine, <hi>Equally,</hi> and <hi>To al the Disciples.</hi> And therefore
saith S. Hierome, accordinge to this example the Lordes supper must be common.</p>

               <p>This tale against that godly man Doctour Luther, is scorneful, and sclaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
blased abroade by Pigghius, Hosius, Staphylus the renegate, and suche o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
onely of wilful malice and hatred of the truthe, and therefore not woorthy to
be answeared. Doctour Luther sheweth what terrible tentations the Diuel laieth
to trappe man withal, takinge occasion sometime of wel dooinge, sometime of euil:
sometime of trueth, sometime of falseheade. And for example he sheweth that the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:12563:14"/>
Diuel on a tyme assaulted him, not in visible forme, but by dreadful suggestions
in his conscience, as it were thus callinge him to remembrance: <hi>These many yeeres thou
hast said Masse, thou hast shewed vp breade and wyne to be woorshipped as God, and yet nowe thou
knowest it was a creature, and not God. Thereof folowed Idolatrie, and thou weare the cause therof.</hi>
Al these thinges he sawe to be true by the testimonie and light of his owne consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and therefore confessed he had offended, and yelded him selfe vnto God. The
Diuels purpose was to leade him to despaire: but God mercifully deliuered him.
And this is Doctour Luthers whole and onely meanynge in that place, that no
man of him selfe is hable to withstande such assaultes, and tentations of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie,
but onely by the power and mercie of God: This (good reader) is that
<hi>Schoole of Satan:</hi> this is that woonderful Tragedie whereat M. Hardinge maketh
such horrible exclamations. If he thinke it so haynous a mater for a godly man
to be vexed by the diuel,<note place="margin">Matthaei. 4. 2. Corinth. 12.</note> perhaps he wil also fynde some faulte with Christe, that
was caried by the Diuel into the mounte: or with S. Paule that had the Angel of
Sathan to buffet him: or with a great numbre of his portuise Sainctes, whose le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendes
are ful of visions of Diuels, with other like childishe fables. As for Luther,
y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> doctrine that he taught in his schoole touching this pointe, is the very Gospel of
Christe, and therefore it increaseth, and entreth into the hartes of men, and the
lyes and sclaunders of the enemies shal neuer be hable to preuayle against it.</p>

he not, of whom it is so called? Uerely neither the Hebrues in their tongue,

S. Cyprian, nor Origen, nor Lactantius, nor S. Hierome, nor S. Augustine in any

the Sacrifice is so commonly called the Masse. If it might haue pleased him to

woordes for confirmation of thy faithe concerninge the Masse. Miserable is that
faithe, that in so weightie maters can be confirmed with bare names by hearinge
nothinge. I maruel that M. Harding euer durst either to allege such authorities,
as he knoweth the most hereof be, or thus openly to mocke the worlde.</p>
               <p>For briefly to touche Melchisedech, Malachias, &amp; the institution of Christ, what
weight can there appeare in these reasons,<note place="margin">Genes. 14.</note> Melchisedech brought foorth breade and
wine to banket Abraham and his armie beyng wearie of the chase: Or, Malachias
Prophesied that al the nations of the worlde should be turned vnto God,<note place="margin">Malachiae. 1.</note> &amp; should
offer vnto him a pure Sacrifice:<note place="margin">Matthae. 26.</note> Or, Christe ordeined his last Supper amongst his
Disciples, &amp; badde them doo the same in his remembraunce: <hi>ergo,</hi> there was priuate
Masse in the Churche. Who euer made any such argumentes in any schoole? what,
wil M. Harding make folke beleue, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Melchisedech, Malachias, or Christe, said pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
Masse? Or doth he thincke y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> these reasons must be taken, bicause he speaketh
the woorde?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:12563:16"/>
But he wil saie,<note place="margin">Clemens.</note> and Malachias, signified the Sacrifice of the
newe testament. We denie it not. But did they signifie a Sacrifice done by one
man alone, in a strange language, the people lookinge on him, and no man kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wynge
what he meaneth? Why may we not thinke rather, they signified the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
of the holy Communion, whereas the whole people dooth lifte vp their han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
and hartes vnto heauen, and pray and sacrifice togeather, reioisinge in the
crosse of Christ, and so celebratinge the lordes death vntil he comme? for the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
that is prophesied by Malachie, as it is expounded by Tertullian, S. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,
and other holy Fathers, is the Sacrifice of prayer, &amp; contrite harte, as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
in the seuentienth article it shal further appeare.</p>
               <p>Touching the witnesses here alleged, first I maruel that M. Hardinge would
euer bringe them foorthe, but muche more that he woulde thus sette them out,
with such circumstances of commendation, as that they saw Christe in the fleshe,
or that they were the Apostles fellowes. For he knoweth wel, that many of them
are litle woorthy of suche credite, as partely beynge euer doubted of, and suspected
to be written, not by them, whose names they beare, but by Heretiques, to whom
M. Hardinge séemeth nowe to flie for ayde: partely also obscure, vnknowen, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted,
not readde, not séene, not harde of in the worlde before this tyme.</p>
               <p>But most of al I maruel that he would euer hasarde his cause on these witnesses,
who, as he him selfe very wel knoweth, wil speake against him. And therefore
he hath here cunningly suppressed their woordes, and hath onely made a mustre of
their names, but woulde suffer them to say nothinge.</p>
               <p>And that thou (good reader) maist haue a taste hereof,<note place="margin">Clemente.</note> and sée the faithfulnesse
of these mennes dealinge, let vs first consyder Clemens, who, as it is reported
here, was the Apostles fellowe. The title of the booke séemeth to be <hi>De Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicis
traditionibꝰ:</hi> that is, Of orders taken &amp; diuised by the Apostles of Christe,
for the better gouernment of the Churche. A woorthy booke no doubte, and in al
ages to be had in great price, if men had béen perswaded, it had béen written in dede
by Clement.<note place="margin">Hierony. de ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiast. scripto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus.</note> But S. Hierome by the reporte of Eusebius, maketh mention onely of
one epistle of Clementes, that he thought woorthy to be receiued, which epistle not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstandyng
is not nowe to be founde. One other epistle of Clementes he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
of:<note place="margin">Bookes counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited in <hi>S.</hi> Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes name.</note> but he sayth it was neuer allowed by the Churche. And further S. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome
sayth: <hi>Certaine other bookes there are reported to be abroade in the name of Clement,
as the disputation of Peter and Appion, whiche bookes were neuer in vse amongst our fathers,
neither conteine they pure, and Apostolical doctrine.</hi> Thus muche S. Hierome.</p>
               <p>Nowe whence then commeth M. Hardinges Clement?<note place="margin">Petrus Crabbe in. 1. tomo Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.</note> It was founde very
lately in the Ile of Candie, by one <hi>Carolus Capellius</hi> a Uenetian, written in
Gréeke, and in these countreis, neuer hearde of, nor séene before.</p>
               <p>Here the reader, be he neuer so simple, yet must he thinke thus muche with him
selfe. Clemens was Bishop of Rome, as it is thought, nexte after S. Peter. And
were the Bishop of Romes bookes, and suche bookes, so strange, so holy, and of such
weight, kept in Candie, so farre of from Italie, in an Ilande in the sea, and not
in Rome? written in Gréeke, &amp; not in Latine? And coulde suche a woorthy woorke
diuised by al the Apostles, and set foorth by the Apostles fellowe, be layde vp in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cresie
for the space of a thousande, fiue hundred yéeres and more, and no man misse
it? Thus muche the reader may soone consider with him selfe, be he neuer so simple.</p>
               <p>But what if this booke were neuer written by S. Clement? what if it were
written by no honest man? what if it were written by an Heretique? Uerely it
was a common practise in olde times, to sette wicked bookes abroade vnder the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
and titles of the Apostles, and other godly Fathers. Leo sometime Bishop
of Rome writeth thus: <hi>Apocriphae Scripturae, quae sub nominibus Apostolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum

them as if they were true.</hi>
                  </hi> Thus M. Hardinges Clement is disallowed by Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius,
and by S. Hierome, mistrusted by Bessarion, condemned by Gelasius, kepte
forth comminge in close pryson for the space of a thousande and fiue hundred yeres,
yet muste we now without refusal stoupe vnto him, and take him as the Apostles
fellow.</p>
               <p>One other of these witnesse is Abdias,<note place="margin">Abdias.</note> and he is brought in with al his titles:
the Bishop of Babylon, planted there by the Apostles: one that was conuersant
with Christe, and hearde him preache, and sawe him in the fleashe: and was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
al the martyrdome of S. Andrew: with al other circumstances that may gea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
credit amonge the simple. Of this Abdias somewhat must be spoken, and so
much the more, for that his name is so glorious. He was sought out, and
founde, and set abroade of very late yeres, vnder the name of Abdias, by one
Wolphgangus Zazius, a man that taketh greate paynes to force men to beléeue it
is the very selfe same Abdias that he maketh him selfe to be: and therefore he saith,
he was one of the .lxxij. Disciples, ordred Bishop by the Apostles, and that S. Luke
the Euangelist writyng the Actes of the Apostles borowed many whole stories
woorde by woorde out of him. Then was S. Luke verie vnthankeful, that neuer
once made mention of his author.</p>
               <p>But who so euer, or what so euer this Abdias were, his owne woordes doo so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wraye
him, that a blinde man may see it was not he. He maketh manie shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
lies, that he was present with Christe, and at the moste parte of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
dooynges, &amp; yet were the Apostles then accordyng to Christes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement

he reigned afterwarde in Ethiopia the space of .lxiij. yeres, and further maketh
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:12563:17"/>
mention of Egesippus,<note place="margin">Abdias. Martialis.</note> that liued aboue one hundred and thrée score yéeres after
Christe. If Abdias were aliue al this while, he mighte be likened to <hi>Iohannes
de temporibus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Caguinus.</note> who, as the Frenche storie recordeth, liued in Fraunce aboue thrée
hundred yéeres. A lier muste be circumspecte, and mindeful what he say.<note place="margin">Paulus Aemylius.</note> If
he sawe Christe in the fleashe, it is not likely he euer sawe Egesippus, that was
so longe after Christe: If he sawe Egesippus, it is not likely he euer saw Christe.
Thus if he reporte truthe in the one, he lieth in the other: and so, whether he lie,
or saie truthe, he cannot be Abdias.</p>
               <p>Touchinge the substance of his booke, it is nothinge els, for the more parte

                  </hi>
Al these and suche like tales thus disallowed by S. Augustine, are repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by M. Hardinges Abdias in great soothe. I thought it not amisse to speake
hereof the more at large, for that I sawe a booke so ful of tales, so lately founde
out, without any good shewe of credite, to be fathered vpon the Apostles disciple,
and sente into the worlde with suche a countenaunce. S. Augustine séemeth in

to be writen by Heretikes.</p>
               <p>Thus is this Abdias a booke as it is apparent, ful of manifest lies, and as it
may be supposed by S. Augustine &amp; Gelasius, written and fauoured by Heretikes,

of Chrysostome seuen hundred yéeres. Nowe it were very muche for M. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge

               <p>Thou séest, Christian reader, what Doctours here be brought, as M. Hardinge
saithe, to grounde thy faithe, and saluation vpon. If he coulde haue brought
any better, I trowe, he woulde haue spared these. But suche doctrine, such doctours.
These doubtful authorities, I trust, will sette mennes consciences out of doubte.</p>
               <p>Now, not withstandinge it be something troublesome, yet shal it not be from
the purpose, for trial of these mennes faithful dealinge, to examine some of M.
Hardinges owne witnesses, and to heare what they wil depose. Al these, as it
is saide, auoutche the Sacrifice, otherwise called the Masse: and not onely these,

               <p>Here M. Hardinge muche abuseth bothe his owne learninge, and also the trust

neither the forme, nor the order, nor the name of Masse.</p>

               <p>But what if neither Clement the Apostles fellow, nor Abdias, nor S. Iames,
nor Basile, nor Chrysostome, nor any other of al these here alleged, speake one

can not communicate, are commaundeth foorthe: The whole Churche prayeth,
singeth, and receiueth the holy Sacramentes al togeather. Suche Masses they
be, that the olde Catholike Fathers canne witnesse of. And of other Masse they
knowe none. M. Hardinge him selfe confesseth that in the Primitiue Churche
the people receiued the Communion euery day.</p>
               <p>Yet not withstandinge, for his Priuate Masse he allegeth the names of

               <p>But he wil say, he alleged al these Doctours by way of digression, to an other
purpose, to prooue the Sacrifice. Firste there is very smal proufe in suche wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses

so large digressions from the mater, before ye once entre into the mater. And
as touchyng the Sacrifice, if you haue any at al, you haue it onely of the institution
of Christe: otherwise you haue none. But wée are sure, we haue Christes institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

the firste sentence of his booke with, <hi>enim,</hi> whiche a very childe would scarse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

saithe, and soothely auoutcheth, that Antichriste shal be the Diuel, and no man,
and shal onely beare the shape of a man: Yet S. Paule calleth Antichrist the Man
of sinne.<note place="margin">2. Thessaloni. 2.</note> Besides this, he hath a further fantasie, that Antichriste shal subdewe
the kinges of Egypte, Aphrica, and Ethiopia, and that he shal builde vp againe
the Temple of Hierusalem:<note place="margin">Reuelabitur ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo peccati.</note> And that S. Iohn that wrote the bookes of Apocalyps,
or Reuelations, shal come againe with Elias, and Enoch to reproue Antichriste.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:12563:19"/>
And al this saith he without either warrant of the Scriptures,<note place="margin">Hippolyt. Martyr.</note> or authoritie of
the Churche. And writinge that booke namely vpon the Prophete Daniel, he
allegeth the Apocalyps of S. Iohn, in the stéede of Daniel, whiche is a token ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of great ignorance, or of marueilous obliuion. Moreouer he saithe, that the
soules of menne were from the beginninge: whiche is an Heresie, with other
dreames and phantasies many moe. This is M. Hardinges Catholike doctour.

he wil precisely builde vpon the woordes, then muste al other Priestes stande
backe and haue no place in Heauen, but Bishoppes onely. For although they
offer vp, as M. Hardinge saithe, the dayly Sacrifice, yet it is wel knowen, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge
to the nature and vse of the woorde, they are Priestes onely, and not Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppes.
If he wil make reckeninge of this woorde, <hi>Quotidiè,</hi> Dayly, then where
shal the Bishop of Rome and his Cardinalles stande, that scarsely haue leasure
to Sacrifice once through the whole yeere? And if it be Christe him selfe that
they offer vp vnto the Father, as they say, Howe is the same Christe offered vp
vnto Christe him selfe? Howe is Christe bothe the thinge that is offred, and also
the partie vnto whome it is offered? But there is no inconuenience to a man in
his dreame. And if it be the Masse that Hippolytus here speaketh of, how is
it offered bothe day and night? For Hostiensis saithe,<note place="margin">Hostien. in sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma De celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione missarum.</note> It is not lawful by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons

               <p>But the meaninge of Hippolytus séemeth to be this, that al faithful people
in this respecte be Priestes, and Bishoppes, like as S. Peter also calleth them,<note place="margin">1. Petri. 2.</note> and
that euerie of them by faithe maketh vnto God a pure Sacrifice, and bothe day

that in the Primitiue Churche was no Priuate Masse, which, as he sayth, came in
afterwarde by the negligence and vndeuotion of the people. It is great pitie, that
so good a thinge, as it is supposed, should haue no better beginninge. One spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
principle of these mennes doctrine is, to embarre the people from readinge and
vnderstandinge of the Scriptures,<note place="margin">M. Hardinge articulo 15. diui. 7. folio 155. b.</note> and to suffer them to know nothinge: for that
as some of them haue saide, they be Dogges, and Swine, and therefore should not
precious stones be layde before them. Yet now must their negligence be the rule
of Christes Religion. This is laide as the grounde and foundation of the whole
cause, and therefore it ought the better to be considered.</p>
               <p>Eckius, Pigghius, Hosius, and others haue often cried out amayne in their
bookes and Pulpites, <hi>where was your Religion before Lùther first beganne to Preache?</hi> So
may wée likewise say, And where was your Priuate Masse, whiche is the crowne
of your kingedome, before your people firste beganne to growe negligent, and to
wante deuotion? Some haue saide, the Church is gouerned by the Pope: some by
the general Councels: some by the holy Ghost. M. Hardinge saith better, it is not
amisse, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Churche be gouerned by the negligence, and vndeuotion of the people.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Charitie,</hi> say they, <hi>is colde, and the people is carelesse.</hi> But therefore hath God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
Pastours and Ministers to ouersée and control the people, and not to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
them to perishe in their negligence. Were it a mater of tiethes or other pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes,
the people should be called vpon, and not suffered in any wise to be negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent:
neither should their negligence stande for excuse. How much lesse should

it be suffered, when the case toucheth God?<note place="margin">Concil. Bracar. 2 Cap. 84.</note> The Bishoppes and Fathers in the

men contrarywise turne away their faces from their brethren: and suppresse their

and finde no faulte with the people, but rather make them beléeue that they receiue
for them, and applie Christes death vnto them by their Masse, and that the verie
hearyng thereof is sufficient for them, and meritorious: and thus, as muche as in

highest to the lowest.</hi> Wherefore if wante of deuotion, and loosenesse of life
may breede negligence in the people, why may not the like wante,<note place="margin">Esai. 50.</note> and as greate
loosenesse, bréede the like negligence in the Priestes? And if negligence be excuse
sufficient, to warrant the people to Communicate but once in the yere, why may
not the same negligence cause the Priestes to say Masse but once in the yere? For
it is not the loue of God, as you surmise, neither the hunger or thirst of Heauenly
foode, that maketh the Priest to say Masse, but order of fundation, custome, hiere
or wages for his labour.</p>
               <p>Now let vs viewe the weight of M. Hardinges reasons: <hi>The people is negligent
and vndeuoute: <hi>ergo,</hi> The Priest may say Masse alone.</hi> This argument is verie weake.</p>
               <p>But the nexte that is geathered of the same, is much weaker: <hi>The people is negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
now: <hi>ergo</hi> there was Priuate Masse in the Primitiue Churche.</hi> For this onely was
my denial: and this hath M. Hardyng taken in hande to prooue. It is called <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titio
principij,</hi> where as one weake thinge is proued by an other, as weake as it.
So might M. Hardinge say: The people wil not heare the woorde of God: <hi>ergo,</hi>
the Priest may goe into the Pulpit and Preache alone. <hi>For Christes Supper</hi> (as
S. Augustine sayth) <hi>is a Sermon, and the Priest therein Preacheth,</hi>

the increase of them, al idle, al in studie and contemplation, al voide from worldly

Masse? Ye wherefore haue they so many Masses seuerally, at diuers Altars, and
many of them at one time? Wherefore doo not they Communicate togeather, as it
appeareth they did in the Primitiue Churche? Doubtlesse this groweth not of
the negligence of the people.</p>
               <p>As for the people, they are not so negligent, nor vndeuoute, as M. Hardinge
here chargeth them. They are Gods people, glad to be instructed, and desirous to
folowe, and where so euer the Gospel is receiued, readie to geue testimonie therof,
and to increase the same by the holy Communion of Christes Body and Bloud, in
greate companies, and whole congregations al togeather.</p>
               <p>But what it lucke is this, that they whom M. Hardinge so often condemneth
for Heretikes, can be so deuoute: and he, and his Catholikes thus remayne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
deuotion. Let the people be taught: let them heare the holy Ministration
in their owne tongue, that they may vnderstande the holy Mysteries, &amp; féele com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte
and swéetnesse in the same: let them see examples of diligence in the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie:
then wil they be no longer negligent. Then should M. Hardinge perforce
geue ouer his priuate Masse, as séeing that the whole right of his cause hangeth
onely of the negligence and misdooing of the people.</p>

broken two: the Consecration, &amp; Oblation: and so haue only a bare Communion.</p>
               <p>But whereby may it appeare to M. Hardynge, that wée haue thus broken

               </p>
               <p>A litle before M. Hardinge saide, in Christes Institution thrée thinges are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined,
Consecration, Oblation, Participation. Immediatly after, as a man
that had sodainely forgotten him selfe, he saith, <hi>The number of the Communicantes togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                  <note place="margin">M. Hardinge hath forgotten himselfe.</note> 
                  <hi>that they iangle so muche of as a thinge so necessarie, is no parte of Christes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution.</hi>
It is no maruel though he can so il agrée with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> olde Catholike Doctours,
that falleth thus out so sodainely with him selfe. For if Participation be not
necessarie, how is it a parte of Christes Institution? If it be a parte of Christes
Institution, how is it not necessarie? He woulde faine conuey Christes Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and his Masse bothe vnder one colour. But they are Contraries, the one of
them bewraieth the other. As for the Priest, he taketh no parte of the Sacrament
with others, whiche is the nature, and meaninge of this woorde <hi>Participation,</hi>
but receiueth al alone. Thus it appeareth by M. Hardinges owne confession,
that Priuate Masse hauinge no Participation of the Priest with others, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
no Participation at al, is no parte of Christes Institution.</p>
               <p>I graunte, certaine circumstances, as fasting, sitting, standing, knéeling, and
other like Ceremonies aboute the holy Ministration, are lefte to the discretion of
the Churche. But this is a very simple argument, <hi>Certaine Circumstances may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered:
<hi>Ergo,</hi> the Priest may receiue alone.</hi> Christe him selfe hath already determined
the case. For al be it he haue appointed no certaine number of Communicantes,
yet hath he by special woordes appointed a number. For these very woordes, <hi>Take
ye:</hi>

               <p>Yet saithe M. Hardinge, S. Augustines woordes be plaine,

Whiche woordes M. Hardinge thought best cunningly to dissemble. In other
places S. Augustine, like as also S. Hierome and others, witnesseth that the whole
people daily receiued togeather, and generally intreatinge of the holy Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion,
he speaketh euermore of a number, and neuer of one alone.</p>
               <p>Now whereas M. Hardinge saithe, <hi>Christe leafte suche maters to the determination
of the Churche,</hi> and to that purpose séemeth to allege, as others doo, these woordes of
S. Paule, <hi>Coetera cùm venero disponam: <hi>Touchinge the rest, I wil take order, when I

                  </hi> This kinde of Doctrine vnto the olde Fathers seemed very daungerous. For
S. Augustine saithe, <hi>Omnes insipientissimi Haeretici, qui se Christianos vocari volunt,

               <p>The moste peeuishe Heretikes that be, that woulde faine be called Christians, doo colour the
bolde enterprises of their fantasies, by occasion of this saying of the Gospel, whereas the Lorde
saith: Yet haue I many thinges to say vnto you, but ye are not hable now to beare them.</p>
               <p>But if the Churche haue determined this mater for priuate Masse, as M. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge
saith, in what Councel, at what time within sixe hundred yeres after Christ,
and in what place was it determined? Who was witnesse of the dooinge? Who
was president? Who was Present? This is it that the Reader woulde faine
learne. And M. Hardinge thinketh it best to prooue it by silence. How be it, it is
already confessed, that Priuate Masse came in, not by Christe, or by any of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
or by the Authoritie of the Churche, but onely by the vndeuotion, and
negligence of the people.</p>

woordes of S. Paule,</hi> Touchinge the rest, I wil take order when I come. <hi>For vpon these
woordes they builde their Priuate Masse, euen in suche forme as it is now vsed in.
As if S. Paule shoulde saye thus,</hi> At my comminge I wil take order, that ye shal haue
Masse in a strange tongue: that ye shal receiue alone: that ye shal not looke, and waite one
for an other, notwithstanding any my former co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement: that ye shal not neede to meete
togeather: that one shal receiue for al the rest: and so at my comming I wil vndoo, what so

                  <note place="margin">M. Hardinges Argumente.</note> Christe <hi>(saith he)</hi>
ordeined the Sacrament, after Consecration and Oblation done, to be receiued, and eaten: <hi>Ergo,</hi>
the number of Communicantes togeather is no parte of Christes institution.</p>
               <p>What, thought M. Hardinge that none but children, and fooles shoulde reade
his booke? For how loosely hange these partes togeather? The Sacramente
must be receiued after Consecration: <hi>Ergo,</hi> The number of Communicantes is
not necessarie. There is not one péece hereof that either is true in it selfe, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gréeth

               <p>For touchinge Consecration, if he wil precisely folow the woordes of the
Euangelistes,<note place="margin">Matthae. 20. Luc 22.</note> whiche wrote the storie, <hi>Christe first tooke the Breade: and blessed it:

he seemeth to confesse, that his Masse, what so euer substance it beare, yet

may this be? To Minister the Sacramentes of Christe, as Christe him selfe
did, &amp; commaunded to be doone, is called an Accident Ceremonial, that may wel be
chaunged: But for the Priest to speake in a straunge vnknowen tongue: to turne
his face from the people: to Minister vnto him selfe alone: and to vse an infinite
sorte of childish ceremonies, whiche neither Christe, nor his Apostles euer either
vsed, or thought of, al these are holden for thinges substantial, and of importance,
and be defended as necessary, and may not be chaunged. Suche power haue these

               <p>
                  <hi>The Churche</hi> (saithe M. Harding) <hi>hath charged and ordred, that no man that is woorthy
and disposed, shalbe refused.</hi> O miserable is that Churche, where as no man, no not so
muche as one, is wel disposed. Here in fewe woordes he condemneth the
whole Churche of Rome, euen y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole Colledge of Cardinalles: amongst whom,
as he saith, there is not one wel disposed, and woorthie: and therfore they al with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe

Therefore M. Hardinge shoulde driue his vnwoorthy people from the Churche,

may boldly cal God his Father, may also be bolde to receiue the Communion.</p>
               <p>If M. Harding wish in déede that the people woulde prepare them selues, &amp; Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
with the Priest, as he pretendeth, why dooth he not exhorte &amp; mooue the
people? Why dooth he not prouide for them? Why dooth he rather defende his Sole
Receiuing contrary to his owne wisshing, and contrary to the example of Christe,
as he him selfe confesseth? Doubtlesse there are many godly men emonge the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and oftentimes more vertuously disposed a greate deale, then the Priest. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is it of their vnwoorthinesse, that they absteine so often: nor of their woorthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
that they receiue once in the yere: but onely of custome.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But if the people beslacke, yet must the Priest doo the Daily Sacrifice,</hi> saith M. Hardinge,
that is, he must offer vp Christe vnto his Father for the sinnes of the worlde.
Herein appeareth the wanton folie of this people. That they may doo, and
are commaunded to doo, they wil not doo: but that they can not doo, that they wil
néedes doo. The mater beinge so weighty, and not yet throughly beléeued,
it had béen good for M. Harding to haue made proufe thereof by the authoritie of S.

M. Hardinge meaneth, as it shal soone appeare. The olde Fathers cal that the
Daily Sacrifice, that Christe made once for al vpon the Crosse: for that as Christe
is a Priest for euer, so dooth the same his Sacrifice last for euer: not that it is

thereof is infinite in it selfe, and shal neuer be consumed. So saithe S. Augustine,

               <p>Likewise the same one Sacrifice is euerlastinge not onely in it selfe, for that
the vertue thereof is daily effectual in vs, and endureth for euer, but also of our

thankes geuing for that so merciful, and wonderful woorke of our Redemption.
And this kinde of Daily Sacrifice, biside a great number of other olde Doctours,
the godly Father <hi>Irenaeus</hi> hath taught vs to make: His woordes be these, <hi>Sic

Or how may wée make it good? Is there none other meane to remember
Christes death, but onely by saiyng Priuate Masse? Or is not euery one of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people
bounde to remember the same, as deepely, and as often as the Priest? It is a very
simple sequele, onely vpon remembrance of Christes Death to founde the Masse.
Doubtlesse the Masse, as it is now vsed, vtterly drowneth and defaceth al maner

               <p>But to put a litle more weight to this séely reason, where as M. Hardinge
saithe: <hi>The Priest ought daily to Sacrifice, ye although there be no man to receiue with him,</hi> I
wil say further in his behalfe: If this Sacrifice be so necessarie, as it is supposed,
then is the Priest bounde to Sacrifice euery day, ye although he him selfe receiue
not. For the Sacrifice, and the Receiuing are sundrie thinges, as it is also noted
in a late Councel holden at Toledo in Spaine. <hi>Quidam sacerdotes vno die plurima

<hi>For that common diete, and consent farther bringeth vs into the remembrance of

appeare vnto the indifferent reader, that these woordes doo sufficiently declare, both
the common receiuinge of the Sacrament, and also the knittinge and ioyninge of
many togeather.</p>
               <p>Now let vs examine this reason: The Communion hath his name of the effect,
for that it ioyneth vs vnto God: <hi>Ergo,</hi> sayth M. Hardinge, it signifieth not the
communicatinge of many togeather. Surely this argument is very weake: I
wil not say, It is vnlearned, or procéedeth of ignorance. He shoulde néede a newe
Logique, that would assay to make it good.</p>
               <p>Nay, it may muche better be replied: what effecte can this Sacrament haue, or
whome canne it ioyne to God, but onely suche as doo receiue it? Or what effecte
can the Sacrament of Baptisme worke, but onely in them that receiue Baptisme?
Without al question, theffecte that Dionysius meante, standeth not in this, that
one man saithe a Priuate Masse, and receiueth the Sacrament alone: but in this
that the people prayeth, and receiueth the holy Communion togeather, &amp; thereby
dothe openly testifie, that they be al one in Christe Iesus, and al one emongst them
selues.<note place="margin">Chrysostom, Ad popul. Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chen. homil. 61.</note> And therefore Chrysostome saieth, <hi>Proptereà in Mysterijs alter al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

not the Ministration of Sacramentes, but a side, a parte, or a felowship or consent

togeather in sayeinge Masse.</hi> If S. Paule might haue had some conference

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But who can better expounde S. Hieromes woordes, then S. Hierome him

needeful to goe so farre. For beyng here in Palestine, we are ioyned to the same Church
in like ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner. And let him not make mater, that it is so farre of. For beyng here in the litle towne

               </p>
               <p>The errour of these M. Hardinges reasons is called <hi>Fallacia aequiuocatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi>
That is, a falseheade in reasoninge, risinge by the craftie handlinge of one
woorde, that hath twoo, or moe significations, whereby one thinge is laide foorth in
shewe, and an other is concluded. This woorde <hi>Communio,</hi> beinge one, impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
twoo thinges, Consent in Religion, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ministration of the holy Mysteries.
The one is spiritual, the other corporal: The one requireth circumstance of place,
the other requireth no place. Therefore to say, S. Hierome and S. Augustine,
beyng so farre a sunder, did Communicate in Religion: <hi>ergo,</hi> they did Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
in breakinge and receiuinge the Sacrament: hath no more order in sequele,
then if M. Hardinge woulde reason thus: S. Hierome, and S. Augustine did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
in Spirite, <hi>ergo,</hi> they did also communicate in Bodie: Or thus, Their
Sprites were togeather, <hi>ergo,</hi> their Bodies were togeather. So might he aswel
say,<note place="margin">4. Regum. 5. 1. Corinth. 5.</note> The Sprite of Elizeus was with Giezi his man vpon the way: <hi>ergo,</hi> the bodie
of Elizeus was with Giezi vpon the way: Or, The Sprite of Paule was with the
Corinthians: <hi>ergo,</hi> his bodie was with the Corinthians.</p>
               <p>By this argument M. Hardinge might very directly haue concluded againste
him selfe: The whole Churche of God is but one house, and al the members of the
same doo Communicate togeather in Faithe and Sprite: Hereof we may founde
the <hi>maior.</hi> Euery particular Churche ought to be a resemblance of the whole
Churche: and this particular Communion ought to be a resemblance of that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Communion: That general Communion is common to al, and euery mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
receiueth his parte: <hi>ergo,</hi> the particular Communion ought to be ministred
commonly vnto al, and euery member to receiue his parte.</p>
               <p>Or thus, The Ministration of the holy Communion representeth the coniunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and felowship that we haue in Faithe:<note place="margin">Cyprianus ad Magnum.</note> And as S. Cyprian saithe, <hi>that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
men are ioyned togeather with vnseparable Charitie, the Lordes Sacramentes doo declare:</hi>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:12563:28"/>
But Christian people being assembled in one Churche doo Communicate in Faith
al togeather: <hi>ergo,</hi> beinge so assembled they ought to Communicate in Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
al togeather.</p>
               <p>But M. Hardinge of the nature of this woorde, <hi>Communio,</hi> séemeth to fashion
out farre other argumentes:</p>
               <p>It is called <hi>Communio,</hi> saithe he: <hi>ergo,</hi> it may be Priuate.</p>
               <p>It is called <hi>Communio: ergo,</hi> it may be receiued of one alone.</p>
               <p>It is called <hi>Communio: ergo,</hi> the Prieste may receiue it without communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantes.
O M. Hardinge weighe your argumentes better before you sende them
thus abroade. You shal lesse offende God, and your owne conscience: you shal lesse
deceiue your brethren: and children shal take lesse occasion to wounder at you.</p>
               <p>Now to adde a litle more hereunto toutchinge the nature of this woorde <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munio,</hi>
wherein you so vncourteousely charge al others with ignorance, and lacke

                  </hi> I thought it good to accompanie Cyrillus
with these other auncient Fathers, for the better vnderstanding of his meaninge.</p>
               <p>Hereof M. Hardinge séemeth to reason thus: By the Communion al faithful
are ioyned bothe vnto God, &amp; also betwéene them selues: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Priest may say
Priuate Masse. Litle thought y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good Father, that his woordes should euer be thus
vsed, or so violently forced to such Conclusions. But let vs driue this argument
a little further, that the inconuenience and the errour may the better appeare.</p>
               <p>Onely the Priestes in their Priuate Masses receiue the Communion: <hi>Ergo,</hi>
for that action and time onely the Priestes are made one Bodie of Christe. And
then further, That bodie of Christe is the whole Churche: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Priestes by
their Priuate Masses, are made the whole Churche.</p>
               <p>But that thou maiste plainely sée, Christian reader, wherein M. Hardinge was
thus deceiued: thou must vnderstande, that Cyrillus taketh his reason, as farre as
it toucheth the Communion of the Sacrament, as wée vse to saie in schooles, <hi>Ab ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectis,</hi>
and not <hi>A causis.</hi> But M. Hardinge turneth it quite contrary: as if it were
taken <hi>A causis,</hi> and not <hi>Ab effectis.</hi> And that Cyrillus so reasoneth, it is soone
séene. For the receiuinge of the Sacrament is not the efficient cause, that wée are
made one Bodie in Christe,<note place="margin">Roman. 4. Signaculum.</note> but a token, and testimonie, or as S. Paule saith, the
Seale &amp; Confirmation of that effecte. For Iudas receiued the Sacrament aswel as
Peter did: yet was not Iudas a me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of Christes Bodie, as Peter was. And many
infantes &amp; others faithful, and godly be very members of that Bodie: &amp; yet by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of death, or otherwise, neuer receiue the Sacrament of Christes Bodie.</p>
               <p>And not withstandinge M. Hardinge hath thus altered his authours meaning,
yet shal he very hardly thereof in good order conclude his Masse. But he may of
the same very wel and directly conclude the Communion. For if the Communion
in that it is receiued of many, be a testimonie and a declaration that al faithful are
one Bodie in Christe, as Cyrillus meaneth, then ought the same Communion to
be receiued togeather of many: otherwise it is no suche testimonie or declaration as
is supposed. The Antecedent or firste proposition hereof, is proued by sundrie olde
Fathers.<note place="margin">Cyprianus ad Magnion.</note> S. Cyprian saithe, <hi>With what loue and concorde al faithful Christians are

               <p>Further touchinge Excommunication,<note place="margin">Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note> I saide thus, If the Prieste that saithe
Masse in Louaine, may communicate with the Prieste that saieth Masse in Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute,
whiche is M. Hardinges greatest grounde for his Priuate Masse, then hath
the Churche so farre foorthe as toucheth the Priestes, loste the whole vse of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication.
For the partie excommunicate beinge a Priest, might saye, he
woulde say Masse, and so receiue the Communion, euen with the Bishop of whom
he were excommunicate, whether he woulde or no. This sayinge M. Hardinge
hath condemned for péeuishe, by his authoritie onely, and not by reason.</p>
               <p>In déede the Churche of Rome, as it hath lost the whole vse of the holy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
so hath it also lost y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole vse of Excommunication. For these twoo woordes
be of contrary natures, and the one of them hath his name of the loosinge of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
In the primitiue Churche as al the Godly were fréely receiued to the holy
Mysteries, so by the authoritie of the Spirite of God, the apparent wicked and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
were remoued, and that with great discretion, accordinge to the enormitie &amp;
qualitie of the faultes: as it is specially noted by <hi>Gregorius Naeocaesariensis</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gregorius Naeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caesariensis.</note> in a
Canon touchynge the same. The greatest offenders were vtterly excluded from

were suffred to enter into the temple,<note place="margin">Audientes.</note> and to heare the Sermon, but at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge

<hi>Stant rei, &amp; velut in lamentationibus constituti: &amp; cùm sacra celebratio fuerit

It followeth, <hi>Constituto verò tempore, velut quoddam debitum exoluentes,

                  </hi> Thus the

offenders were put from the Communion, and al the reste receiued togeather.<note place="margin">Exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication.</note>
And therefore it is decréed by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Canons of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apostles,<note place="margin">Canon. Apostol. Canon. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>That al Faithful that entre in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Churche, and heare the Scriptures, and doo not continue out the Praiers, nor receiue the
Communion, should be excommunicate, as men woorkinge the trouble and disorder of the
Churche.</hi> And the people saide vnto Timotheus beinge a Bishop of the Arrians,
and neuerthelesse a man of milde and gentle nature, and shunninge his companie
for the one, and yet louinge him for the other: Although we Communicate not
with thée, yet wée loue thée notwithstanding.</p>
               <p>Now, if M. Hardinges principle stande for good, that the Priest sayeinge his
Priuate Masse, may receiue the Communion with al others in other places that
doo the like, then can no Priest be excommunicate. For notwithstanding neither
any other Priest, nor any of the people wil receiue with him, yet may he say a
Priuate Masse, and by M. Hardinges new diuise straight way communicate with
them al.</p>
               <p>But for better declaration of this mater, it is commonly taught in Schooles,
that <hi>Priuatio praesupponit habitum,</hi> that is, that the loosinge of a thinge firste
presupposeth the hauing of the same: for no man can loose that thinge, that he hath
not. Therfore to say, there is Excommunication from the Sacramentes, where
as is no Communion of the Sacramentes: Or that he is put from the Lordes
Table, that neither is at, nor comming to the Table: Or that he is Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
that is onely forbidden to heare Masse: Or that the people doth sufficiently
receiue the Sacramentes by the mouthe of the Priest: Uerely this kinde of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge
in the Primitiue Churche woulde haue séemed not onely péeuish, but also
fantastical and méere Frantike. Thus the Bishop of Rome (as it is saide, vseth
to Excommunicate Locustes, Snakes, Caterpillers, &amp; other like woormes: &amp; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurers
vse to Excommunicate their Diuels: as though these creatures, sauing the

               <head>The B. of Sarisburie.</head>
               <p>This storie is common and knowen to many. The weast Churche in kéepinge
of Easter day folowed S. Peter: the East Churche folowed S. Iohn, and keapte
it otherwise. Hereof grew contention, and brake out into cruel heates. Uictor
the Bishop of Rome on the one side: and Polycarpus the Bishop of Smyrna on
the other side: bothe godly men, and both Martyrs. Eche parte woulde haue the
other to yelde. Uictor being a man of a fierie nature, was minded to Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
the whole Churche of Asia, and al others what so euer, that in kéepinge of
Easter day woulde not folow the Churche of Rome. Irenaeus the Bishop of Lions
hearing thereof, wrote vnto him a sharpe letter out of Fraunce, willinge him in
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:12563:33"/>
anywise to procéede no further: for that it might tende to suche a breache, as would
not afterwarde be recouered. Emonge other woordes he saith thus, as it is here
alleged: <hi>The Priestes, that were (in Rome) before thee, notwithstandinge they keopte not
the Easter as they of Asia doo, yet they sente the Sacrament vnto the Priestes of those Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
when they came to Rome.</hi> Hereof M. Hardinge concludethe: <hi>Ergo, <hi>these
Bishoppes did Communicate before they mette togeather:</hi>
                  </hi> and noteth also by the way in the
Margine, that the Gréeke in Eusebius differeth from the common Translation
of Rufinus. And yet is the same Translation alleged and vsed in the booke of
Councels amonge the Decrees of Uictor.<note place="margin">Concil. tomo. 1. inter decreta Victoris.</note> But if M. Hardinge had marked the
mater wel, he should haue séene that his owne Translation in Englishe varieth
also somwhat from the Gréeke.</p>
               <p>In this shorte storie three thinges specially may be noted. Fyrst, that Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus
a Bishop of Fraunce durst to write so roughly to the Bishop of Rome, with
out any style of Superioritie, onely calling him, and al others before him Bishops
of Rome, by the name of Priestes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that so notable learned men and Martyrs of Christe, agreeing other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
in the substance of Religion, yet notwithstanding in certaine smal maters of
no greate weight, contended and striued so extremely, and so longe, and coulde in
no wise be reconciled. Whiche thinge well considered, M. Harding hath lesse cause
to triumphe, if God haue suffered any suche sparkle of dissension in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> special mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of his Churche in these daies.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, where was then that great superioritie of the Bishop of Rome, when,
notwithstanding his threates and commaundementes, the Church of this Ilande
of Britaine wel neare vntil seuen hundred yeres after Christe,<note place="margin">Beda Eccl. histo. lib. 3. ca. 25.</note> in the kéepinge of
Easter day folowed the maner of the Gréeke Church, without any regarde therein
had to the Churche of Rome?</p>
               <p>But to the mater, <hi>these Bishoppes</hi> (saithe M. Hardinge) <hi>Communicated togeather
before they mette.</hi> If he meane, in Faithe, and Religion, it is not denied: if, in
the vse of the Sacramentes, it is not proued. In my iudgement this woorde
<hi>Eucharistia,</hi> in this place of Irenaeus, signi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eth not the Sacrament alreadie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrate,
but rather other common Breade, wherewith one Bishop vsed then to
present an other, as with a special token of consent in Religion, and Christian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde:
whiche Breade the receiuer afterwarde if he thought it good, might vse at
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy Ministration. In that sense it séemeth Paulinus wrote vnto S. Augustine,<note place="margin">Paulinus ad Augustin. Epist. 35.</note>

Hunc panem tu eulogiam esse facies dignatione sumendi. <hi>In token of mutual
loue, I haue sente vnto thee one loafe of Breade, in whiche also the soundenesse of the holy
Trinitie is conteined. This loafe you shal cause to be a louinge present of my behalfe vouche-sauinge

                  </hi> Hereby it may appeare that this Breade was not the Sacramente:
and namely by that Paulinus writeth in an other place:<note place="margin">Paulin. ad Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust. epist. 31.</note>

                  </hi> If it had

               <p>But Irenaeus vseth this woorde <hi>Eucharistia,</hi> whiche is taken for the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
I answeare: it might so be called, for that it was prepared for the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
How be it,<note place="margin">De praescripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one aduersus haereticos.</note> herein I wil not striue. Tertullian<note place="margin">Tertullian.</note> nameth it <hi>Hospitalitatis

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:12563:33"/>
also graunted in this place of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> let vs now see M. Hardinges reasons.</p>
               <p>The Bishop of Rome saithe he, sent y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sacrament vnto them, that came out of
Asia: <hi>Ergo,</hi> there was Priuate Masse.</p>
               <p>This Conclusion is farre fette, and hangeth loosely. For I might demaunde,
whiche then of the thrée saide Masse? He that sente the Sacrament: or he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
it: or els the Messenger that brought it? It were a straunge mater to sée a
Masse, and yet no man to say Masse. Uerely <hi>Irenaeus</hi> hath not one woorde, neither
of the Communion, nor of the Masse: onelesse M. Hardinge wil say, that <hi>Mittere</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mittere Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristiam.</note>
is Latine to Communicate: or <hi>Mittere Eucharistiam,</hi> is Latine to say Masse.</p>
               <p>If it were Common Breade, then was it but a present: If it were the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
then was it to be receiued, not streight vpon the way, or perhappes late in
the night, or in the Inne at the common table emonge other meates: but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
at his pleasure in his Congregation. Thus wée sée this place first is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful:
and beinge neuer so plaine, yet it proueth nothinge for Priuate Masse. But

then to Communicate togeather: whiche thinge M. Hardinge thought better to
dissemble.<note place="margin">

as also by diuerse other auncient Doctoures, wee may gather, that in the times of persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the maner was, that the Priestes deliuered to deuoute and godly men and women the Sacrament
Consecrated in the Churche to carie home with them, to receiue a parte of it euery morning fasting,
as their deuotion serued them, so secreatly as they might, that the Infidels shoulde not espie them,
nor get any knowlege of the holy Mysteries. And this was doone bicause they might not assemble
them selues in solemne congregation, for feare of the Infidels amongst whom they dwelt. Neither
shoulde the case of necessitie haue excused them of the breache of Christes commaundement, if the
Sole Communion had been expressely forbidden, as wee are borne in hande by those that vpholde
the contrary doctrine. And Origen that au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cient Doctour, and likewise <hi>S.</hi> Augustine doth write of the
great reuerence, feare, and warenesse, that the men and wemen vsed in receiuing the Sacrament in
a cleane linen clothe to cary it home with them for the same purpose. <hi>S.</hi> Cyprian writeth of a woman
that did the like, though vnwoorthely after this sorte. <hi>Cum quaedam arcam suam, in qua
domini sanctum fuit,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In sermone de lapsis.</note>

at home to be receiued of a deuoute Christian person alone at conuenient time. The example
of Serapion of whom Dionysius Alexandrinus writeth,<note place="margin">Ecclesiast. hist. lib. 6. cap. 44.</note> recited by Eusebius, confirmeth our purpose
of the single Communion. This Serapion one of Alexandria, had committed Idolatrie, and liyng at
the pointe of death, that he might be reconciled to the Churche before he departed, sent to the Priest
for the Sacrament. The Priest being himselfe sicke and not hable to come, gaue to the ladde that

               <p>As touchinge Tertullian, wée must remember that the faithful in that time,
for feare of the Tyrannes vnder whom they liued, were often driuen to pray a

afterwarde in their houses at home, to put them daily the better in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,
that they were the members of one Churche.</p>
               <p>This maner of the Churche considered, Tertullian being a Priest, as S. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome
writeth of him,<note place="margin">Hieronymus: De Ecclesiast. Scrip. Tertullian a maried Priest.</note> and hauing a wife, wrote vnto her an exhortation, that if it
shoulde please God, to take him first from the worlde, that she woulde remayne

other thinges he saithe thus:<note place="margin">Tertullian, li. 2. ad vxorem.</note>

               <p>Concerninge the storie of Serapion, here are interlaced many faire woordes
for increase of credite, that it was written by Dionysius Alexandrinus, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
by Eusebius, as though the sicke man had onely desired his Housel before he
departed, &amp; nothing els. But the special mater wherevpon the storie is grounded,
is passed by. Eusebius recordeth in plaine woordes, that the booke, wherein Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nysius
wrote this storie, was intituled <hi>De Poenitentia.</hi> Whereby he geueth
to vnderstande, that the Sacrament then was not generally sente home to al
mens houses, but onely vnto them that were excommunicate, and might not
receiue in the Congregation emonge the faithful, and nowe laye in despayre
of life.</p>
               <p>The case stoode thus:<note place="margin">Eusebius li.6. ca. 44.</note> Serapion in the time of persecution for feare of death
had offered Sacrifice vnto an Idol. The faithfull beynge therewith fore offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
put him out of their Congregation, and gaue him ouer to Sathan. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge
thus leaste as an Heathen and an Idolater, mought neither resorte to the

comforte amonge his brethren. So harde the Churche was then to be intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for them, that had fallen backe into Idolatrie. After he had made al mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
and had with teares besought his brethren, and was no way considered,
through heauinesse of minde he beganne to droope, and fell sicke, and for thrée
daies laye speachelesse, and without sense. The fourthe day beynge somewhat
reuiued, he saide to them that were aboute him, O how longe wil yee kéepe me
here? Sende for one of the Priestes (that I may be restored before I departe.)</p>
               <p>His minde was tormented with consideration of the state he stoode in, for that
he had forsaken God. The Priest beinge sicke him selfe, in token he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored,

by his boye. The rest that M. Hardinge addeth <hi>(And this solemnitie beinge doone,

Al this is set to, either by Ruffinus,<note place="margin">Ruffinus. li. 6. ca. 34.</note> or by some other, I know not by whom,

As concerninge this, that it is no greeuous offence, for one to be driuen by necessitie in times of
persecution to receiue the Communion with his owne hande, no Priest nor Deacon beinge presente,
it is a thinge superfluous to declare,<note place="margin">The .29. vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truthe, M. Hard. hath corrupted the transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. These vvordes (<hi>with them selues alone</hi>) are not in S. Basil.</note> for that by longe custome and practice it hath been confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
and taken place. For al they whiche liue a solitarie life in wildernesse where no Priest is to
be had, keepinge the Communion at home, doo Communicate with them selues alone. And in
Alexandria, and in Egypte, euery one of the people for the moste parte, hath the Communion at
home in his house. For when as the Priest hath once Consecrate and distribute the Hoste, it is
reason wee beleeue, that wee ought to be partakers of it, and he that taketh it, receiueth it
without al scruple of conscience, and putteth it to his mouthe with his owne hande. And so
it is of one vertue, whether anybody take one parte of the Priest, or moe partes togeather. Thus
farre <hi>S.</hi> Basil. In this saieing of Basil, it is to be noted: First that necessitie here hath respecte to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
the lacke of Priest and Deacon: So as 30<note place="margin">The .30. vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truthe. S. Basil saith, The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municante receiued vvith his ovvne hand euen in the presence of the Priest.</note> in that case the Sacrament might be receiued of a faithful
person with his owne hande. And that for the ratifiyng of so dooinge he allegeth continuance of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
custome, whiche for vs in this pointe of the Sole receiuinge, may in more ample wise be alleged.</p>
               <p>Againe, that holy Eremites liuinge in wildernesse aparte from companie, and also the deuoute <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
people of Alexandria and Egypte, receiued the Communion alone in their Celles and houses. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore
that the Hoste once consecrated of the Priest is algates to be receiued whether of many <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
togeather, or of one alone, by him it seemeth not to force.</p>
               <p>Finally, that whether a man take at the Priestes hande the blessed Sacrament in one piece or mo <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
pieces, and receiue them at conuenient times, when deuotion best serueth: the vertue, effecte, and
power thereof is one. By whiche authoritie reseruation is auouched. Doubtlesse where he
speaketh so precisely and particularly of sundrie cases touchinge the order of receiuinge, if he had
been of <hi>M.</hi> Iuels opinion that the Sacrament may not be receiued of one without a certaine number
of Communicantes togeather, he woulde not so haue passed ouer that mater in silence, muche lesse
written so plainely of the contrarie. Now that the Communion thus kepte in wildernesse and
in Egypte, places of extreame heate, where wine in smal quantitie as is for that purpose conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
can not be longe kepte from sowringe, and chaungeing his nature, was in the forme of Breade

already hath made it good. For saithe he, bothe the Eremites in the wildernesse,
and euery of the people in Egypte, and Alexandria, for the more parte haue the
Sacrament at home, and eche of them doothe minister it vnto him selfe.</p>
               <p>Yea euen in the Churche, after that the Priest hath distributed a portion of the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:12563:37"/>
Sacrament, he that hath receiued it, putteth it to his mouthe with his owne
hande without any remorse or doubt of conscience: and whether he receiue one
portion of the Priest or moe, the effecte and strength thereof is al one. This is
the very meaning of S. Basil: al be it for plainnesse sake reseruing the sense I haue
somwhat altered the woordes. But muche I maruel, how M. Hardinge can gea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hereof his Priuate Masse.</p>
               <p>Touchinge his fiue special notes, if wée graunte them throughly euery one,
yet is he nothing the neare his purpose. For his Masse is none of them.</p>
               <p>The Eremites Sole receiuynge, as it nothinge hindreth vs that denie not the
facte, so it nothing furthereth him, vnlesse he will haue lay men, and wemen to
doo so stil.</p>
               <p>The reason that S. Basil maketh of custome, and continuance being wel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
is very weake, both for many other good and iust causes, and also for that
the same custome as it was neuer vniuersally receiued, so vpon better aduise by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the Churche it was cleane abolished. For wyse men in Goddes causes
haue euermore mistrusted the authoritie of Custome.</p>
               <p>The Heretikes in olde time named <hi>Aquarij,</hi> that in the Holy Ministration
vsed water onely, &amp; no Wyne, notwithstanding they manifestly brake Christes
Iustitution as our Aduersaries doo now, yet they vphelde their doinges therein by
longe Custome.<note place="margin">Ad Iubaian. De Haereticis Baptizan.</note> But S. Cyprian being then aliue wrote thus against them:
<hi>Victi ratione opponunt consuetudinem, quasi consuetudo fit maior veritate &amp;c. <hi>Beynge
ouercome with reason they defende them selfe by Custome, as though Custome were better
then the Truthe. Wee may not prescribe of Custome, but wee muste ouercome with
reason.<note place="margin">Cyprian: ad Quirmum.</note> Custome without trueth is the mother of erroure.</hi>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>But be it that bothe the Reason were good, and the Custome that longe si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thence
hath béen abolished,<note place="margin">Cyprian. ad Pompeium con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra Epistol.</note> had remained still: Yet is not M. Hardinge hable
out of this place precisely, and vndoubtedly to proue his Priuate Masse. For
if a man shoulde say, it may possibly be, that these Eremites did not Minister
seuerally eche man to him selfe alone,<note place="margin">Stephani.</note> but one of them vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reast of the Eremites
dwellynge in the wildernesse, as it appeareth diuersely, they had times to
méete, and to pray togeather: Or that the householders in Egypte, and Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,
Ministred not onely to them selues, but also to their whole seueral fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
as it is written of Hippolytus Martyr, that beinge a lay man, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
the Communion of Iustinus beynge a Prieste, and bare it home, and
Ministred the same to his Wife, his Children, and his Seruauntes: If a man
woulde thus say, perhappes M. Hardinge woulde better bethinke him selfe of
his Conclusions. This sense may seeme to stande very wel with S. Basiles
woordes, notwithstandinge M. Hardinge in his Translation into Englishe hath
openly falsified the same. For whereas it is written in the Greeke, and
so likewise in the Latine,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>They receiue of them selues,</hi> Whiche may wel be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanded,
that one of them receiued of an other for wante of a Prieste, he
hath otherwise wreasted it to come to his tune, and hath turned it thus: <hi>They doo
Communicate with themselues alone:</hi> Wherein al be it I wil not greately striue, yet
neither this woorde <hi>Alone,</hi> nor these woordes <hi>with them selues,</hi> can be founde either
in the Gréeke, or in the Latine.</p>
               <p>This longe allegation of S. Basiles woordes, with all the furniture there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
may shortely be geathered into this reason: These Eremites beynge no
Priestes receiued alone: <hi>Ergo,</hi> These Eremites beinge no Priestes saide Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
Masse.</p>
               <p>Further M. Hardinge saithe, This Sole Receiuing was allowed by custome,
<hi>Ergo,</hi> Priuate Masse likewise is lawful by custome.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:12563:38"/>
This reason goeth rounde against him selfe. For it may be wel replied: This
Sole Receiuinge was an abuse, and therefore was abolished by the Churche not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstandinge
custome: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Priuate Masse likewise is an abuse, and ought to
be abolished notwithstanding custome.</p>
               <p>Now let vs see, whether these very selfe woordes of S. Basil here alleged by
M. Hardinge, make any thinge for the Holy Communion. And what authoritie
can be against vs, if M. Hardinges owne authorities, yea, as him selfe vaunteth,
<hi>The moste manifest and plainest of al his authorities,</hi> be founde with vs? For trial hereof
wée muste resorte, not into the wildernesse, where as was neither Prieste, nor
Deacon, as it is confessed, but vnto the Churches that were in S. Basiles time.
So shal wée soone sée, whether the Ministration then vsed were a Communion,
or a Priuate Masse.</p>
               <p>S. Basil in the same place saithe thus, <hi>Wee doo Communicate foure times in the
weeke:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Basil. ad Caesa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam patritia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> 
                  <hi>vpon the Sunday, Wensday, Friday, and Saturday.</hi> If wée may founde any
thinge vpon woordes, he saithe, <hi>Wee Communicate:</hi> he saith not, <hi>we say Masse.</hi> And
thus, saithe S. Basil, <hi>wee doo foure times in the weeke.</hi> Then had they not the
Daily Sacrifice,<note place="margin">No Dayly Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.</note> wherevpon Priuate Masse is grounded. He muche misserecke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
him selfe, that saithe, that thinge is daily doone, whiche is doone but foure
times in seuen daies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moreouer S. Basil saith,</hi> After the Priest hath once Consecrate, and diuided the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
wee must thinke that we ought to receiue, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     </gap>
                  </note> accordingly. For in
the Church the Priest geueth porte, and the Communicant receiueth it with al freedome of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
and with his owne hande putteth it to his mouthe. Therfore is the vertue al one,
whether it be one portion onely that he receiueth of the Priest, or moe togeather.</p>

not haue them receiue at home. S. Hieromes woordes be these: <hi>Why dare they not

What, is there one Christe abroade, and an other Christe at home?</hi> If the people did

               <p>Here M. Hardinge interlaceth other mater of the office of wedlocke, the woords

whereof S. Augustine wrote a Booke againste Iouinian intitled <hi>De bono Coniugij:</hi>

meates, and not of the Sacrament.<note place="margin">Paraphrasis E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasmi in. 1. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth. 11.</note> In his Paraphrase he expoundeth it thus: <hi>Hie
vnanimitatis Christianae mysterium agitur &amp;c. <hi>Here is practised the Mysterie of Christian
vnitie, and not prouision made for the belly. For that ought ye to doo in your priuate houses,
and not in the publike Congregation. If ye woulde fille your bellies, haue ye not houses, where
ye may doo it by your selues alone?</hi>
                  </hi> And againe, <hi>if any man be so greedie of meate, that he
can not tarie, let him eate at home.</hi> Thus saithe M. Hardinge, <hi>Erasmus gathereth the
Priuate Masse out of the Scriptures.</hi> M. Hardinge is ouer quicke in his Conclusions.
He maketh him selfe sure of the Consequent, before he sée the Antecedent. For
Erasmus hath not one woorde there neither of Priuate Masse, nor of single Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.
How then can he geate that of Erasmus, that Erasmus him selfe hath
not? Neither is this any necessarie forme of reason, Men receiued the Sacrament
in their houses: <hi>Ergo,</hi> they receiued the Sacrament alone. For they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
in their seueral houses with their wiues and families altogeather, as it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie
proued by the example of Hippolytus Martyr.<note place="margin">Hieronym in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologia aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Iouinianu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> And S. Hierome saieth, <hi>The
Sacrament was sent home to the man and wife.</hi> Otherwise it might be saide, God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
that euery man shoulde eate the Easter Lamme in his house, <hi>Ergo,</hi> God
commaunded that euery man shoulde eate that Lamme alone. How be it I make

shewe the féeblenesse of these Conclusions.</p>
               <p>Yet saithe M. Hardinge, <hi>bothe <hi>S.</hi> Hierome and <hi>S.</hi> Basile cal it the Communion, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standinge
it were priuately receiued: whiche is cleane contrary to <hi>M.</hi> Iuelles sense.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion.</note> But neither

sense. They cal it <hi>a Communion,</hi> not for that he that receiued it, communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
with others in other places as M. Hardinge gheasseth: but for that it was a

               <p>The reason that M. Hardinge hereof geathereth muste néedes be this: The

Priuate Masse. He muste néedes be very simple, that wil be ledde by suche single
proufes. S. Hieromes plaine woordes necessarily importe the contrary. For if
this were the custome in Rome for the space of foure hundred yéeres, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

               <p>Marke wel, good reader, how handesomely M. Hardinges argumentes hange
togeather. He muste néedes thinke thée to be very vnsensible, that hopeth thou
wilt yéelde to suche gheasses.</p>
               <p>To leaue a great number of other like absurdities, M. Hardinges argumentes
are framed thus: The Sacrament was receiued in Priuate houses (albeit there
appeareth no suche thinge by Damasus) <hi>Ergo,</hi> one man receiued alone. Surely
then had that man a very emptie house: he might wel singe, <hi>Tanquam passer solita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius
in tecto.</hi> It is more likely, that beinge a godly man, he would desire his wife,
and familie to receiue with him, as I haue saide before.</p>
               <p>Againe, the Sacrament was sent emonge the Parishes: <hi>Ergo,</hi> there was pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
Masse. The force of this reason may soone be séene. But who saide this Masse:
whether it were the Messenger, or the receiuer, I leaue it to M. Hardinge to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
He might better haue concluded thus, The Bishoppe sente the Mysteries a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade
for the people to Communicate: <hi>ergo,</hi> he meante a Communion, and no
Priuate Masse.</p>
               <p>Further he saithe, this was done in time of necessitie, bicause of Heretikes:
and yet by the same he defendeth the Masse vsed now without any suche necessitie:
and that in the Churche of Rome, where, he saithe, can be no Heretikes.</p>
               <p>To conclude, this maner of sendinge abroade the Sacrament, was afterwarde
abolished by the Councel holden at Laodicea.<note place="margin">Concil. Laodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen. Ca. 14</note>
               </p>
               <p>Thus is M. Hardinge driuen to goe by Gheasse: to imagine strange Heretikes:
for shewe of some antiquitie, to allege vaine Decrees without sense: to auoutche
suche orders, as he knoweth were longe sithence condemned: and to comment the
same with his owne Gloses.</p>

               <p>This talke of the Churche of Rome in this place, was néedlesse, as nothinge
seruinge to priuate Masse. Yet is it generally confessed by al menne, that Rome
is the eldest Churche that we know founded in this Weast parte of the worlde, and
that the Churches of Fraunce and other countries at the beginninge, had both the
confirmation of Doctrine, and also other great conference &amp; conforte from thence:
like as also the Churche of Rome had from Hierusalem, and Antioche, and other
great Churches in the Easte. But that the first that euer preached the Ghospel in
Fraunce, were sente from Rome, I recken it not so easy to be proued. For some
say,<note place="margin">Nathanael. Lazarus. Saturninus.</note> that Nathanael, whome Christe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendeth to be the true Israelite, preached
at Trire, and Bituriges: Lazarus whome Christe raysed, at Marsiles: Saturni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus

his deliuerie vnder Nero,<note place="margin">2. ad Timoth. 4. Epiphanius Contra Alogos.</note> went into Spaine, sente Titus into Dalmatia, and
Crescens into Galatia, or as Epiphanius readeth it, into Gallia: Ioseph of Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mathaea
came into Englande. And yet it appeareth not that any of these were
sente by Commission from Rome. But why dothe M. Hardinge thus out of sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
rushe into the commendation of the Churche of Rome that was so longe agoe?
It had bene more to purpose to haue vewed the state of the same Churche, as it
standeth nowe. But as one once saide, ye shal not now finde <hi>Samnium in Samnio,</hi>

euen so I hearde M. Harding sometime say, He had sought for the Church of Rome
in Rome it selfe, and yet coulde not finde the Churche of Rome. The Bishoppes,
Cardinalles, and Priestes, doo neither teache, nor exhorte, nor conforte, nor any

what I liste to allowe, or disallowe: but what he can proue, or not proue, by the
Scriptures, and by the auncient Councels, and Fathers.</p>
               <p>But marke wel, good Christian Reader, and thou shalt sée, how handesomely M.
Harding conueieth and shifteth his handes to deceiue thy sighte. Firste he hath hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
foreborne bothe the name, and also the proufe of Priuate Masse: and onely
hath vsed the woordes of <hi>Sole Receiuinge, and Single Communion:</hi> and so hath taken
paines to proue that thinge, that was neuer denied: and that thinge that we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,
and wherein the whole question standeth, he hath leafte vtterly vntouched.
Now he demaundeth whether I reproue the Masse, or the Priuate Masse? what
meaneth this, that Priuate Masse, and Sole Receiuing, be so sodainely growen in
one? Surely M. Hardinge wel knoweth, that the nature of these woordes is not
one. Neither who so euer receiueth alone, dothe therefore of necessitie say Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
Masse. This so sodaine alteringe of termes may bréede suspicion.</p>
               <p>That he further interlaceth of the <hi>Sacrifice of the Newe Testament,</hi> is an other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyance
to blinde thy sight, as vtterly nothinge makinge to this purpose.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:12563:42"/>
For neither doth the Sacrifice importe Priuate Masse: nor dooth Sole Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge

               <p>And where as M. Hardinge saith, <hi>If you denie this, you must denie al our Religion from the

nothinge.</p>
               <p>

                  </hi> If he fynde faulte with my

It is al one kinde of argument, of lyke forme, and like termes. And as this is

be lawful: and without the same may be vnlawful. For example, It is thought
lawful for a woman to Baptize at home: but it is not thought lawful for a woman
to baptize in the open Churche: yet is the thinge al one: but the circumstance of
place beinge changed, changeth the whole. Againe, it is lawful for a Priest to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
the Sacrament in the forenoone, and in the Church: but it is not lawful for
a Prieste to Minister the Sacrament after he hath dined, or in his bedde: Yet was
it lawful for S. Ambrose, and others so to receiue the Sacrament. We sée there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
there is greate mater in alteration of the circumstance.</p>
               <p>These thinges perhaps may séeme ouer curious, and therefore I passe them by,

out of his place: and there is a Monster.</p>
               <p>Now touchinge M. Hardinges Syllogisme, thou mayst see, that the <hi>Minor,</hi> or
Seconde Proposition is not trewe, as they terme it, <hi>Simpliciter,</hi> and without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.
For the Single Communion was neuer so taken for lawful, but onely in
consideration of circumstances, &amp; cases of necessitie. Which cases beinge either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued,
or better examined, the same kinde of Single Communion is no longer
thought lawful. Therefore thou mayst thus say to M. Hardinge: <hi>How say you sir?
Doo you allowe the examples that you haue brought to proue your Masse by? or doo you not
allowe them?</hi> If you allowe them, why then suffer ye not Wemen to carie home the
Sacrament, and to keepe it in Cheastes, and Napkins, as they did of olde? If you
allowe them not, bicause they were abuses, why then séeke you to proue your Masse
by the same, and so to establishe one abuse by an other? Now let vs looke a litle
backe to the note, that M. Harding set out in the Margine for our remembrance, by
these woordes <hi>(Proufes for Priuate Masse).</hi> That it might séeme lawful for a Prieste
to say Priuate Masse, he hath brought in examples of Laye men, Wemen, Sicke

y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Laye people should say Masse? Or was there no Priest al this while in the world
for the space of .600. yéeres, that Wemen and Children muste come foorth to proue
these maters? Or was there no difference then betwéene Sole Receiuinge, and
Priuate Masse? Or shal we thinke that Wemen and Boyes did then Consecrate
the holy Mysteries, or offer vp Christes Bodie: or make Sacrifice for quicke and
dead: or applie Christes deathe vnto others? Where is M. Hardinges Logique
becomme? where is the sharpenesse of his witte?</p>

the Masse it selfe, by the single Communion of the Prieste in case of the peoples coldenesse and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence,
it is nothinge impaired. Els if the publike sacrifice of the Churche might not be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
without a number of communicantes receiuinge with the Prieste in one place: then woulde the
auncient Fathers in al their writinges some wheare haue complayned of the ceasinge of that, whiche
euery where they cal <hi>Quotidianum &amp; iuge sacrificium,</hi> the dayly and continual sacrifice: of
whiche their opinion is, that it ought 34 dayly to be sacrificed,<note place="margin">The. 34. vntruthe. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers say not so, but plainely the contrary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

woorke of our redemption might alwaies be celebrated, and had in memorie, and we thereby shew
our selues accordinge to our bounden dutie mindeful and thankeful. But verely the Fathers no where
complaine of intermittinge the dayly Sacrifice, but very muche of the slackenesse of the people, for
that they came not more often vnto this holy and holsome banket: and yet they neuer compelled them
thereto, but exhortinge them to frequent it woorthely, lefte them to their owne conscience.</p>

then more weight may be put vnto it in this case: for that where as the receiuinge of Christes Body
is a farre greater mater, then to answeare the Priest at Masse, if that holy Bishop and Martyr, had
thought it so necessarie as that the Masse might not be doone without it: Doubtlesse of very reason and
conuenience, he woulde, and shoulde haue specially spoken of that, rather then of the other. But for
that he thought otherwise, he required onely of necessitie, the presence of twoo for the purpose a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue

practise of deceiuers, to blase their dooinges by the names of such, as thei knew
to be in estimation in the worlde. For to passe by Homer, Hefiod, Cicero, Plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,
and suche others counted learned and famous amonge the Heathens, in whose

that letters sometime were falsified, and set abroade in his name. So were

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:12563:46"/>
Cyprian, and other like. This was vnto some a common pastime: and many godly
Fathers complaine muche of it.</p>
               <p>Wherefore wée ought the lesse to maruel if the like haue happened vnto Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cletus,
Euaristus, Soter, and suche others, as folowed immediatly in Rome after

               <p>Gratian sheweth that the Decretal Epistles haue béene doubted of amonge
the learned:<note place="margin">Distin. 19.</note> And Doctor Smithe, although his authoritie be not greate, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared

Epistles manifestly depraue, and abuse the Scriptures, as it may soone appeare
vnto the godly Reader vpon the sight: They mainteine nothinge so muche, as the
state and kingedome of the Pope: and yet was there no such state erected in many
hundred yeres after the Apostles time: they publishe a multitude of vaine and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious
Ceremonies, &amp; other like fantasies, farre vnlike the Apostles doctrine:
They proclaime suche thinges, as M. Hardinge knoweth to be open, and kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen

               <p>Anacletus that was next after Peter,<note place="margin">Distin. 97.</note> willeth and straitly commaundeth, that
al Bishops once in the yere,<note place="margin">Iuxta sanctoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> doo visite the entrie of S. Peters Churche in Rome,
whiche they cal <hi>Limina Petri.</hi> Yet was there then no Churche yet builte there in
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of Peter.<note place="margin">In Decretal.</note> For Pope Cornelius saith (as he is alleged) that he first tooke vp
S.<note place="margin">Cornelij.</note> Peters body, and buried the same in Appolloes Churche in Rome, at the leaste
one hundred and fortie yeres after that Anacletus was dead. Pope Antherus
maketh mention of Eusebius Alexandrinus, and Felix, whiche liued a longe time
after him, and therefore was it not possible for him to know them. Fabianus
writeth of the cominge of Nouatus into Italy:<note place="margin">Cypria. li. 1. cp. 3.</note> And yet it is cleare by S. Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian,
and by Eusebius,<note place="margin">Eusebius, lib. 6. ca. 43.</note> that Nouatus came first into Italy in the time of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius
whiche was next after him. And to leaue a number of other coniectures,
which may be hereafter more aptly touched some otherwhere, neither S. Hierome,
nor Gennadius, intreatinge of the Ecclesiastical writers, nor Damasus writinge
purposely of the liues of the Bishoppes of Rome before him, euer made any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
either of suche Epistles, or of any suche Decrees: whiche they woulde not
haue dissembled, if there had béen any suche extant or knowen in their time. Thus
haue I briefely geuen a tast of these Decretal authorities, that the reader may the
better vnderstande, of what credite they ought to be.</p>
               <p>Now touchinge the mater, that by this Decrée of Soter Bishop of Rome, it
should then be lawful for the Priest there to say Masse, hauing onely twoo others
in his companie, the state, &amp; storie of the time considered, it séemeth very vnlikely.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> For bothe S. Augustine,<note place="margin">Augustin epist. 118. and Ianua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium.</note> and S. Hierome, who liued twoo hundred and fiftie yeres

or <hi>Orate pro me Fratres,</hi> were any parte of the Liturgie of Rome in Soters time.
For Damasus,<note place="margin">Damasus in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist. ad Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymum.</note> whiche was Bishop of Rome twoo hundred and fiftie yeres after
that, writeth vnto S. Hierome, that thinges were doone with suche simplicitie in

els but some Epistle of the Apostle, or some Chapter of the Gospel, read openly
vnto the people: which whether he meante of the holy Ministration or no, I leaue

               <p>Further this same Soter requireth, that bothe these twoo, and as many others <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>

kinde of proufe is thought to holde in Goddes Commaundementes, for that they
be ful and perfite, and God hath specially charged vs, that we shoulde neither put

with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> priest, then notwithstanding this Decrée, M. Hardinge hath not
yet founde his priuate Masse. Then consider this Decrée written in the name of
Pope <hi>Calixtus: Peracta Consecratione,<note place="margin">De Con. dist. 2. Peracta.</note> omnes Communicent, qui noluerint Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticis

<hi>The Consecration beinge doone,<note place="margin">De Con. dist. 1.</note> set al Communicate, onlesse they wil be remoued from the

                  </hi> By this
Decrée these two were bounde, either to Communicate with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> priest, or to departe
foorth of the Churche. If they did Communicate, then hath M. Hardinge here no
Priuate Masse: If they departed foorthe, then coulde the prieste saye no Masse at
al: for Soter at least requireth the presence of two.</p>
               <p>Againe, the argument that M. Hardinge geathereth out of this Decrée,
<q>
                     <p>Three persons were present,
<lb/>
                        <hi>Ergo</hi> Two of them did not receiue,</p>
                  </q>
is vtterly vnsensible, and voyde of reason. Rather he might haue concluded thus:
<q>
                     <p>Soter willeth that two be present,
<lb/>
                        <hi>Ergo,</hi> muche more he willeth that the same two doo Communicate.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>It may also stande with reason, and with the common practise of the Churche
at that time, that these two, whose presence Soter requireth, were Priestes, or
Deacons,<note place="margin">De Con. dist 1. Hoc quoque. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the people, as in déede it is determined by the Glose. And so this Decrée of Soter
agreeth with an other Decrée of Anacletus made to the like purpose, that is,
<hi>That the Bishop at the ministration haue aboute him a certaine number of Deacons,<note place="margin">De Con. dist. 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>piscopus Deo.</note> Subdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons,
and other Ministers, bisides the common multitude of the laye people.</hi> And likewise
with an other Decrée of the same Soter,<note place="margin">De Con. dist. 1. Vt illud.</note> that is, <hi>That euery Priest makinge the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
haue by him an other Priest to assist him, and to make an ende of the Ministration, if any
quame or sicknesse happen to fal vpon him.</hi> And this assistance of the priest is required
notwithstandinge the presence of others, either of the Clerkes, or of the Laitie.</p>
               <p>Nowe beinge Priestes, or Clerkes, and beynge present at the Ministration,
the lawe specially constrained them to receiue the holy Communion with the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister,
as it appeareth by this Decrée written in the Canons of the Apostles:<note place="margin">Canon. Apost.</note> 
                  <hi>If
any Bishop or Priest,<note place="margin">Can. 9.</note> or Deacon, or any other of the Clerkes, after the Oblation is made, doo
not Communicate, eyther let him shewe cause thereof, that if it be founde reasonable he maye
be excused: or if he shewe no cause, let him be excommunicate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus who so euer these two were, whose presence Soter required, whether
they were of the Laitie, or of the Clergie, the lawe constrained them to receiue
togeather with the Priest: And therefore M. Hardinge hath hitherto founde a

that they shoulde heare the whole Masse euery Sonneday, and not departe before the Priest had geuen
blessinge. So they were bounde to heare Masse euery Sonneday, and to receiue the Communion but thrise
in the yere. The selfe same order was decreed in the Councel of Orleance. Then of like, specially in
smal Townes and Villages, they had Masse without the Communion of many togeather sometimes.<note place="margin">Priuate Masse pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by like lyhoode.</note>

               <p>Now let vs sée what M. Hardinge geathereth out of these two Councels. <hi>Then
of like</hi> (saithe he) <hi>specially in smal townes, and villages, they had Masse without the Communion
of many togeather. Of like,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Of like.</note> was neuer good argument in any Schooles.</p>
               <p>Thou séest (Good Reader) the best that here canne be had, is but a gheasse, and
as it shal afterwarde appeare, a very simple, and a blinde gheasse. It is a woon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to see so great a mater,<note place="margin">Innoce. 3. in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logode officio Missae.</note> and so single proufes. You haue taught the people,
that in your Masse Christe him selfe is Presently,<note place="margin">Durandus li. 4.</note> and Really Sacrificed for the
sinnes of the worlde:<note place="margin">Rupertus de Missa.</note> that al that euer he did, or suffred for our sakes, is liuely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
in the same: and that al Kinges, Princes, and other estates must needes
stoope vnto it. And yet was the same for the space of sixe hundred yeeres, to be
founde onely in poore Townes and Uillages, and that onely by gheasse, and blinde
coniecture, and none otherwise? Or coulde it neuer al that while once entre into
any Citie, or good Towne? And beynge so good a thinge, can no man tel vs, who
published it, and saide it firste?</p>
               <p>But what if the very woordes of these Councels, wherevpon M. Hardinge hath
founded his Masse, make manifest proufe against his Masse? The woordes be these:
<hi>Al Secular Christian folke, be bounde to receiue the Communion at the least thrise in the yere.</hi>
This Relaxation or Priuilege is graunted onely vnto the Secular Christians.
Whereof it foloweth necessarily, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al Ecclesiastical persons, as Priestes, Deacons,
Clerkes, &amp; others what so euer of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sorte were not excepted, but stoode stil bounde
to receiue orderly, as thei had doone before: and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was at al times when so euer there
was any Ministration. And so by the plaine woordes of these Councels the priest
receiued not alone: neither hath M. Hardinge yet founde out his Priuate Masse.</p>
               <p>But that the whole mater may the better appeare, not by gheasse, or ayme,
but by the very Ecclesiastical order of that age, we must vnderstande, that these
and suche other lyke Decrees were made, not for the greattest parte of the people,
that in those daies vsed to Communicate in al their assemblies, but for a fewe, that
were negligent, and haled backe. For otherwise the general order dooth wel ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,
by al the Ecclesiastical recordes of that time.</p>
               <p>And whereas M. Harding hath taken exception of smal townes and villages,
which he gheasseth had then the Priuate Masse, it was decreed and straitely ordred
in a Councel holden at Gerunda in Spaine,<note place="margin">Con. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it is in Englishe. If any man wil haue an Oratorie or Chapel abroade in the countrie, biside the
parishe Churches, in whiche lawful and ordinarie assemblie is: for the rest of the Holy daies, that he
haue Masses there, in consideration of weerinesse of the householde, with iust ordinance wee doo
permit. But at Easter, Christes birthe, Epiphanie, the Ascension of our Lorde, Witsonneday, and
the Natiuitie of S. Iohn Baptist, and if there be any other special feastes: let them not keepe their
Masses, but in the Cities and Parishes. And as for the Clerkes if any wil doo, or haue their Masses,
at the aforesaide feastes in Chapels, onlesse the Bishop so commaunde or permit, let them be thrust out
from Communion. By this Decree wee learne, that then Masses were commonly saide in Priuate
Chapels at home, at suche times, as the people were not accustomed to be houseled. For when by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement
and common order they receiued their rightes, as in the afore named feastes: then were
the Priestes prohibited to saye Masses in Priuate Oratories or Chapels without the Parishe Churches.
And hereof wee may plainely vnderstande, that in suche places Priestes customably saide Masses of
their owne and of the householders deuotion, when none of the householde were disposed to receiue
with them. The like Decree is to be founde, <hi>Concilij Aruernensis. cap. 14. Concil. Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopol.

he coulde by no meanes before bringe him to forgiue his enemie, he had but a smal coniecture, he should
bringe it to passe nowe. And againe, though he had conceiued no distrust of his reconciliation vpon
this holy policie, yet wee may doubt, whether the Patriarke foorthwith without further and more
mature probation, and examination, whiche S. Paule in this case requireth, woulde haue admitted
him to receiue our Lordes Bodie so vpon the suddaine. Now for the seruante, it is a streight case that

doubte, whiche of these three saide that Masse: I meane, the Bishop, or the
Gentleman, or the Seruaunt. For here is no more noted, but that they said the
Lordes praier al thrée togeather: which verely is not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> manner of Priuate Masse.
For there the priest as he receiueth alone, so he saithe the <hi>Pater Noster</hi> him selfe
alone. But in the Communion as the people saide the Lordes prayer al togeather,
as it is noted by S. Gregorie,<note place="margin">Gregori. lib. 7. epist 63.</note> so they receiued al togeather. Thus M. Hardinge
bringeth a witnesse for the Masse, that saieth nothinge for the Masse. The lawe

onely one noble man, onely one seruaunte, al was Priuate.</hi> And further he saithe, <hi>It was a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
straite case, that so Holy a Bishop, in so populous a towne, coulde finde no man to Communicate
with him but his owne seruaunt onely.</hi> Yea doubtlesse it was a very straite case, that a
noble man shoulde be driuen to helpe the priest to Masse: A straite case for M. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge
to renne to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> a thousande miles beyonde al Christendome, to séeke
his Masse, and that not in open Churche neither, but onely in a Priuate Oratorie:
A straite case, that for the space of sixe hundred yeeres after Christe and more, there
was not one Priuate Masse to be founde in the whole Churche of Rome: A very
straite case, that M. Hardinge is thus forced to leaue S. Augustine, S. Hierome,
S. Chrysostome, and al other the godly learned Fathers, and to rake vp of the dust
<hi>Hippolytus, Abdias, Leontius,</hi> and other like newe Doctours without name or
credite, suche as neuer were thought woorthy to be alleged or named before.</p>
               <p>Yet he forceth his gheasses further: <hi>The noble man came vnlooked for: The seruaunte
might haue had some suddaine pange, or some conscience of his vnwoorthinesse, and so the priest per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:12563:52"/>
must haue receiued alone.</hi> Here to aunsweare gheasse with gheasse, euen so might
the priest also him selfe haue had some suddayne pange or quame:<note place="margin">De Con. dist. 1. vt illud.</note> as in deede it is
specially presumed by the lawe, that it maye so happen: or els some suddaine consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of his owne vnwoorthinesse: and so had there béene no Masse at al. Alas these
gheasses be to light in so greate a mater.</p>
               <p>Here further for his pleasure he saithe, <hi>M. Iuel harpeth manie iarringe argumentes.</hi>
Of my argumentes I make no vaunte: If they sounde wel in Goddes eares, they
are wel in tuene: God be thanked we leade not the people by aymes, and gheas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses:
we reare vp no newe Doctours: We combre not the peoples eares with lyes
and fables, as M. Hardinge dooth: We bringe foorth neither wemen, nor boyes to
proue the Communion, as these men are driuen to doo to proue their Masse.</p>
               <p>Moreouer he saithe in scorne, as his manner is, <hi>that wee would haue al the people,
that wil not receiue, to be driuen out of the Churche.</hi> O M. Hardinge, Howe longe wil
you thus wilfully peruerte the waies of the Lorde? You knowe, this is neither
the Doctrine, nor the practise of our Churche. How be it the auncient Doctours
haue bothe taught so, and also practised the same. <hi>Anaclerus</hi> saithe,<note place="margin">De Conse. dist. 1. Episcopus.</note>

               <p>This reason holdeth as the former.</p>
               <p>Consider now gentle Reader, how aptely M. Hardinge answeareth to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
I demaunde the authoritie of S. Augustine, S. Hierome, or some other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
auncient Father: he answeareth me with a childishe Fable. I demaunde
of the vsage of the open Churche: he answeareth me with a priuate Oratorie, as
though at that time there had béene no Churches builte. I demaunde, what was
doone in the face and sight of the people: He answeareth me, what, he supposeth,
was doone in a Corner. I demaunde of him vndoubted truthe, and certaintie: he
answeareth me by coniecture and blinde gheasse.</p>
               <p>I beleeue he woulde not willingly haue hindred his owne cause. If he coulde
haue founde better mater, doubtlesse he woulde haue brought it foorthe. Is this the
Antiquitie, is this the Uniuersalitie, that they so much talke and glorie of? Is this
the common consente of al the worlde?</p>
               <p>Thus then, gentle Reader, standeth my answeare to this tale. Firste that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
it was forbidden by many decrées to minister the Sacrament in priuate houses:
and therefore vnlikely that Iohn Almonar beinge a godly man woulde presume
to doo the contrary.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that this woorde, <hi>Missa,</hi> vsed here by the rude and vtterly vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
Interpreter, dothe not necessarily importe the Masse.</p>
               <p>Thirdly that M. Hardinge the better to furnishe out the mater, hath violently,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
and of purpose, falsified the Translation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:12563:53"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthely, that notwithstandinge here were graunted the Celebration of the
Sacrament, yet it cannot be forced thereof, that the Prieste receiued alone.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, that although this were proued a priuate Masse, yet hath M. Harding
vtterly missereckened him selfe, and so gotten nothinge. For it was without the

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Laste of al hereunto I adde, that the place, where these thinges are imagined

shedinge <hi>proprijs sermonibus,</hi> with prayers and seruice of his owne makinge: and that the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

traunce for cause of the holy ghostes comminge. VVhen the seuenth day was come, he beganne to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
vnto God, that is to witte he saide Masse euery day. After a certaine time thus spent, through
faithe and prayer, he beganne to write with his owne hande, <hi>Mysteria ministrationis,</hi> the Masse,
or the seruice of the Masse. On a night our lorde came vnto him in a vision with the Apostles, and layde

               <p>That this was a Priuate Masse no man can denie. Basile receiued the Sacrament alone, for there

Bishop: <hi>Ephrem</hi> a holy Father: <hi>Amphilochius</hi> a man that had conference with

               <p>But I mee selfe haue had this vnknowen Doctour in my poore Librarie these
twentie yéeres and more, written likewise in veleme, as true, as faire, and of as
good recorde in al respectes, as that other of <hi>Verona:</hi> in déede not vnder the name
of <hi>Amphilochius:</hi> but no doubtes very auncient, as it may soone appeare. For the
same Authour in the same booke hath written also the life of Thomas Becket, who
liued at the least seuen hundred yéeres after that <hi>Amphilochius</hi> this writer was
dead. Therefore that storie writen by him of one that was to come so many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
yéeres after him, must needes be a Prophecie, and not a storie.</p>
               <p>The very names of olde godly Fathers are woorthy of muche honoure. But
as it is wel knowen, many vaine tales haue béene couered vnder the name of olde
Fathers. The life of S. Basile hath béene set foorthe fully, and faithefully by sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie

vaine tales, yet was there none of them so impudent, once to make any mention of
this peeuishe fable of M. Hardinges Masse.</p>
               <p>But, for so muche as the glorious name of this holy Father is here brought
in to beare witnesse to these maters, and that in the night season in a dreame, and

was buried. Whereby it séemeth, that this <hi>Amphilochius</hi> was not very wise
nor circumspecte in his talke. For if <hi>Nazianzene</hi> sawe S. Basiles bodie, how
was it buried? If it were buried, how coulde he sée it?</p>

               <p>To come to the mater, M. Hardinges <hi>Amphilochius</hi> thus telleth on his tale:
Basile, saithe he, beinge once made Bishop, besought God that he might offer vp y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
vnbloudie Sacrifice with his owne woordes: he fel in a traunce: came againe to
him selfe: and so ministred euery day. On a certaine night Christe with his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
came downe to him from heauen: brought breade with him: awooke <hi>Basile,</hi>
and bade him vp, and offer the Sacrifice. Up he arose: was streight at the Aultare:
said his praiers, as he had writen them in his paper: lifted vp the breade: laide it
downe againe: brake it in thrée partes: receiued one: reserued an other to be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
with him: honge vp the thirde in a golden Dooue. And al this was donne,
Christe and his Apostles beinge stil present: who came purposely from Heauen to
healpe <hi>Basile</hi> to Masse.</p>
               <p>We may now the better beleue Homer, that Iuppiter with his Goddes wente
downe sometime for his pleasure to banket in Ethiopia: Or that an <note n="a" place="margin">Sozomenus li. 6. ca. 29.</note> Angel euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more

<note n="d" place="margin">Henricus Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordien. Ca. 49. M. Hardinge falsifieth his owne fable.</note> Or that, when holy <hi>Arnulphus</hi> began Matins at Midnight, and saide <hi>Domine
labia &amp;c.</hi> and al his Monkes were a sleape, a number of Angels supplied the lacke,
and answeared him, <hi>Et os meum annuntiabit Iaudem tuam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But M. Harding layeth on more weight, and forceth this fable to his purpose:
and al be it in the whole tale there is not once the name of Masse, yet is he content
to take paynes conningly to falsifie the texte, and seuen times togeather to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
it onely by the name of Masse. For with him <hi>offerre sacrificium,</hi> is to say
Masse: likewise <hi>Ministrare Deo,</hi> is to say Masse: and <hi>ministerium ministratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi>
is the seruice of the Masse. For as <hi>Midas</hi> what so euer he touched had power
to turne the same into golde: so M. Hardinge what so euer he toucheth hath a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
power to turne the same into his Masse.</p>
               <p>But let vs a litle vewe the Circumstances, and weighe the likelihoodes of this
mater. <hi>Basile</hi> besought God, that he might make the Sacrifice with his owne
woordes. And shal we thinke, he had more fancie to his owne woordes, then he
had to the woordes of Christe? He awooke: stoode vp: and suddainly was at
the Aultare at midnight. What, shal we thinke he was the Sextine there, or laye
al night, like <hi>Eli</hi> or <hi>Samuel,</hi> in the Churche: and yet beinge so famous a Bishop
had no man to attende vpon him?</p>
               <p>He diuided the Breade,<note place="margin">The Golden Dooue.</note> and laide vp the thirde parte of it <hi>in a Golden Dooue,</hi> that
honge ouer the Aultare: and yet by his owne tale, his golden Dooue then was not
yet ready made. For it followeth immmediatly in the nexte lines, <hi>After Basil
had donne these thinges, and had communed with <hi>Eubulus,</hi> and others, the nexte day he sent for
a Golde smithe, and made a Dooue of pure Golde.</hi> It behooueth a liar to be mindeful what
he sayeth. If this Dooue were made before, howe was it made afterwarde? If
it were not made before, howe coulde it then hange ouer the Aultare? Or howe
coulde <hi>Basile</hi> put his breade in it before it was made? And to what ende was that
breade so keapte in the Dooue? And wherein, or where, was the other thirde parte
keapte, that Basile thus reserued purposely to be buried, or as M. Hardinge ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
it, to be interred with him? Wherein M. Hardinges <hi>Amphilochius</hi> bothe
vttereth woordes of manifeste blasphemie, and also shamefully belieth that holy
Father, and doothe him great and open iniurie. It was but fondly donne by S.
<hi>Benet,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dialogorum, li. 2. ca. 24.</note> as <hi>Gregorie</hi> reporteth of him, to cause the Sacrament to be layde vpon a

Bodie of Christe, it were horrible blasphemie to burie it, and, as a dead thinge, to
laye it in the graue.</p>
               <p>Further as this Doctour saithe, S. Basile had this Dreame or Uision,
and reserued this portion of the Sacrament,<note place="margin">The Sacrament reserued seuen yeeres.</note> immediatly after he was made Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop

At other times, when as for the most parte ye are in cleane life, ye come not to receiue your rightes.
But at Easter though ye haue doone some thinges amisse, yet ye come. <hi>O</hi> what a custome is this: <hi>O</hi>

               <p>Here is to be noted, where as Chrysostome saithe, the daily Sacrifice was celebrated in vaine, and
the priestes stoode at the Aultare in vaine: it is not to be vnderstanded of the Sacrifice in it selfe, as
though it were in vaine, and frustrate: but this is to be referred to the people: it was in vaine for
their parte, that shoulde haue receiued their Communion with the priestes, who waited daily for
them, and cried out as the manner was, <hi>Sancta Sanctis,</hi> Holie thinges for the Holie: and after

muche lesse resorte of the people at the Masse time, to receiue the Sacrament with their priestes. And
where as least this place might seeme plainely to auouche the hauinge of Masse without a number

               <p>Here woulde I first know, whether M. Harding wil rest vpon the bare woordes
of Chrysostome, or rather qualifie them somewhat, and take his meaninge. If he
presse the woordes so precisely, as he séemeth to doo, then did not Chrysostome
him selfe Communicate. For he was <hi>Some Body:</hi> and the plaine woordes be, <hi>No

the Priest did neuer Celebrate without a Deacon: and that in euery Masse the Deacon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
the Sacrament in the kinde of Breade, at the Priestes hande: and the Priest the Cuppe at
the Deacons hande.</p>
               <p>But what néedeth muche proufe in a case that is so playne? Chrysostome him
selfe in the Liturgie,<note place="margin">Chrysostom. in Liturgia.</note> that commonly beareth his name, followeth the same order.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>After that the Priestes haue receiued</hi> (saith he) <hi>the Archedeacon commaundeth the Deacons
to come foorthe: and they so comminge receiue as the Priestes did before.</hi> This was the
very order of Chrysostomes Masse, touchinge the Clergie, and that by the witnesse

               <p>Now let M. Hardinge iudge vprightly, whether these shiftes be so poore, as

               <p>But if the whole Clergie had béene so negligent, that not one of them al, being
so many, and so straitely charged, woulde haue Communicated with the Priest, as
M. Hardinge séemeth to condemne them al, onely vpon his owne woorde without

                  </gap>s <hi>Nemo,</hi> were hable of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
to shutte out al the rest of the people.</p>
               <p>Chrysostome in diuers places séemeth to diuide the whole multitude into three
sortes, whereof some were <hi>Penitent,</hi> some <hi>Negligent,</hi> and some <hi>Deuoute.</hi> The
<hi>Penitent</hi> were commaunded away, and might not Communicate: The <hi>Negligent</hi>
sometime departed of them selues, and woulde not Communicate: The <hi>Deuoute</hi>
remained, and receiued togeather. Now, that the <hi>Deuoute</hi> remained stil with
Chrysostome the whole time of the holy Mysteries, it is plaine by the very fame
place,<note place="margin">Chrysost. ad po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulum Antioch. Hom. 61.</note> that M. Hardinge here allegeth for his purpose. For thus Chrysostome saith
vnto the people, <hi>Thou art come into the Churche, and hast songe praises vnto God with the
rest, and hast confessed thee selfe to be one of the woorthy, in that thou departedste not foorth
with the vnwoorthy.</hi> By these woordes he sheweth that some were woorthy, and
some vnwoorthy: that the vnwoorthy departed, and the woorthy remained.</p>
               <p>And againe in the same Homily he saithe, <hi>The Deacon standinge on high, calleth some
to the Communion, and putteth of some: thrusteth out some, and bringeth in some.</hi> Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome
saith, <hi>Some are called,</hi> and <hi>some are brought in</hi> to Receiue with the Priest.</p>
               <p>Where then is now M. Hardinges <hi>Nemo?</hi> Uerely if there were <hi>some people</hi> with
the Priest, then was there no place for <hi>No body:</hi> If <hi>No body</hi> receiued, then is it
not true that Chrysostome saithe, that <hi>Some Receiued.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here of a false Principle, M. Hardinge, as his wonte is, gheasseth out the like
Conclusion: <hi>If there were so few Communicantes in that populous Citie of Antioche, where the
Scriptures were daily expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded and preached, then it is likely in Countrie Churches there were none
at al.</hi> This argument hangeth onely by likelyhoode, as doo the reast of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge:

               <p>This is Chrysostomes sense, and plaine meaninge: and this is a fayre winding
vp of M. Hardinges Clewe.</p>
               <p>Now let vs examine this inuincible argument, wherewithal euery Childe, as
M. Hardinge vaunteth, is hable to proue the Priuate Masse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The <hi>Maior,</hi> is this,</hi> The Sacrifice in Chrysostomes time was daily offred.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The <hi>Minor,</hi> is this,</hi> But many times no man came to Communicate with the
Priest:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Conclusion, <hi>Ergo,</hi>
                  </hi> There was Priuate Masse.</p>
               <p>Here the <hi>Maior</hi> is apparent false: The <hi>Minor</hi> proued at aduentures onely
by blinde gheasse, and so not proued at al: Therefore the Conclusion must néedes
follow after as it may. Onlesse M. Hardinge looke better to it, I trow it wil
proue but a childish argument.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Maior,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Concil. Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinop. 6. Can. 52. Aug. tractat. 26 Basil. ad Caesar. Concil. Laodic. Ca. 49.</note> it is plaine by the sixte Councel of Constantinople: by S.

at <hi>Laodicea,</hi> and by sundrie other authorities to that purpose before alleged, that
the Sacrifice was not daily offred, as M. Hardinge imagineth.</p>
               <p>Touchinge the <hi>Minor,</hi> it is not proued, but hangeth, as I haue saide, onely
by gheasse. M. Hardinge him selfe sawe, that this is but a sclender proufe, <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome
Ministred euery day, <hi>Ergo,</hi> he receiued alone:</hi> And therefore he sought further to
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:12563:59"/>
finde his Single Communion in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Countrie. But Chrysostome saith, <hi>There is No
body to Communicate.</hi> By this it may appeare, as I haue already saide, that Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome
him selfe did not Communicate: onlesse wée wil say, Chrysostome was <hi>No
bodie:</hi> and so <hi>No body</hi> receiued alone: and <hi>No body</hi> him selfe saide M. Hardinges
Priuate Masse. And therefore <hi>No body</hi> may come foorthe, and iustly require me
to subscribe. Thus the <hi>Maior</hi> beinge false, the <hi>Minor</hi> not proued, the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
not following, thou séest, good Christian Reader, what inuincible force M.
Hardinge hath brought to proue his Masse.</p>
               <p>But bicause he séemeth to set somwhat by the windinge vp of his Clewe, it
shal not be from the purpose, to vnwinde it againe, and to lay it abroade, and to
consider the stuffinge of it, and to sée how closely and handesomely it is wounde
togeather.</p>
               <p>First there is not one threade of the holy Scriptures in al this Clew, but the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
plaine example of Christe, and his Apostles quite refused.</p>
               <p>Secondly the Priuate Masse is founded vpon the negligence, and, as M. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
calleth it, the vndeuotion of the people.</p>
               <p>Thirdely, there is a way diuised, how twoo Priestes saieinge their Masses in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
diuerse countries, may Communicate togeather in Breakinge Breade, be the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
betwéen them neuer so greate: and that without any manner warrant of
Scripture or Doctour.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Laye people, wemen, sicke folkes, and boyes, that receiued or mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
the Sacrament alone, are brought in for this purpose: as though it had béene
lawfull then for wemen or boyes to say Masse.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, bicause S. Ambrose, S. Augustine, S. Hierome, S. Chrysostome, S.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
Basil, and suche others woulde not serue, there is brought in a greate number of
Pety Doctours, al of doubtful credite, and many of them longe sithence misseliked,
and condemned by the Churche.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, the mater is made good by Uisions, Dreames, and Fables.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
               </p>
               <p>Seuenthly there are alleged Canons of Councels not extant in any Councel,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>
geathered without greate iudgement by one Gratian, and yet none of them nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
proouing, nor once naminge the Priuate Masse.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, bicause M. Harding coulde not finde his Masse in the whole Church <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/>
of Rome, within the space of sixe hundred yeres after Christe, he hath therefore
made searche at Alexandria in Egypte, at Antioche in Syria, at <hi>Caesaria</hi> in Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>padocia,
a thousande Myles beyonde the Limites of al Christendome, where as
was neuer Priuate Masse said, neither then, nor before y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> time, nor neuer sithence.</p>
               <p>Nienthly, for that he stoode in despaire of Cathedral and other like great Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/>
he hath sought out Chapels, Celles, Oratories, and Priuate houses: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he had no hope to spéede in Townes, or Cities, he hath sought out the litle
Churches in the Countrie.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, notwithstandinge al this inquirie, he hath not yet founde neither <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/>
the name of Priuate Masse, nor any Priest that euer ministred, &amp; receiued alone.</p>
               <p>To be shorte, the whole substance of his proufes hangeth onely vpon his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/>
owne surmise, without any certaintie, or appearance of truthe.</p>
               <p>These be the contentes of M. Hardinges Clew, and thus substantially hath he
prooued the antiquitie, and vniuersalitie of his Masse.</p>
               <p>Now, good Reader, to geue thee onely a taste of some parte, that may be saide
of our side, firste it is apparent, that Christe our Sauiour at his laste Supper
Ministred the holy Communion, and no Priuate Masse, and bade his Disciples to
doo the same in his remembrance.</p>
               <p>Likewise S. Paule willed the Corinthians one to waite, and tarie for an other,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:12563:60"/>
in the holy Ministration,<note place="margin">Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</note> and to conforme them selues to Christes example.</p>
               <p>Wherevpon S. Hierome saithe,<note place="margin">Hieronym. in. 1. Cor. 11.</note> as it is before alleged, <hi>The Lordes Supper must be
Common vnto al: for the Lorde deliuered the Sacramentes equally vnto al the Disciples
that were present.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ambros. 1. Cor. 11.</note> And S. Ambrose likewise expoundinge these woordes, <hi>Inuicem
expectate,</hi> waite one for an other, saith thus, <hi>That the Oblation of many may be ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate
togeather, and may be ministred vnto al.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Canons of the Apostles it is Decréed, that if any man resort vnto the
Churche,<note place="margin">Can. Apost. Canon. 9.</note> and heare the Scriptures, and absteine from the Communion, he stande
excommunicate, as one that troubleth the Congregation.</p>
               <p>The like Decrées are founde vnder the names of <hi>Calixtus,<note place="margin">De Con. dis. 2. peracta.</note> Anacletus, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus,

               <p>
                  <hi>S. Chrysostome plainly describeth the very order of the Communion that was
vsed in his time, by these woordes:</hi> The spiritual and reuerende Sacramentes, are set foorth
equally to riche and poore:<note n="d" place="margin">Cleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. stroma. lib. 1.</note> neither doothe the riche man enioye them more, and the poore man

               <p>
                  <hi>Againe he saithe,</hi> There are thinges wherein the Priest differeth nothinge from the
people:<note place="margin">Chrysost. 2. Cor. hom. 18.</note> as when wee must vse the feareful Mysteries. For wee are al of one woorthinesse to
receiue the same.</p>
               <p>S. Gregorie saithe,<note place="margin">Gregorius Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logor. li. 2. ca. 23.</note> that euen in his time the order was, that in the time of the

<hi>Si quis non Communicat, det locum, <hi>If there be any body, that is not disposed to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate,
let him geue place.</hi>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Latine woorde, <hi>Missa,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Missa.</note> in the time of Tertullian, and S. Cyprian, sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
a dimissing, or a licence to departe: and was specially applied vnto the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
vpon this occasion that I must here declare.<note place="margin">Isido<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Catechumeni,</hi> that is to saye, Nouices of the faithe, and not yet Christened, were
suffered to be present at the Communion, vntil the Gospel was ended. Then the
Deacon commaunded them foorthe, pronouncing these woordes alowde, <hi>Catechu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meni

               <p>This being a Sacrament of Vnitie, euery true Christian man ought in receiuinge of it to consider,
how vnitie may be atchiued and keapte, rather then to shew a streightnesse of conscience aboute the

more, how muche the ende of euery thinge is to be esteemed more, then that, whiche serueth to the

outwarde Ceremonie, that accordinge to the saieinge of S. Augustine, who so euer taketh the Mysterie
of vnitie, and keepeth not the bonde of peace, he taketh not a Mysterie for him selfe, but a testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie

               <p>The former article of Priuate Masse, by M. Hardinges owne confession pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céedeth
not from God, but from the negligence of the people: but the abuse of the

now onely vpon the wilfulnesse of the Priestes: who séeinge, and knowinge the
Institution, and Commaundement of Christe, yet notwithstandinge haue diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

the Apostles, and holie Fathers, that ministred the Communion vnder bothe

               <p>Wée know wel, The fruite of the Sacrament standeth not, neither in the
Formes, nor in the Breade, or Wine, whiche are outwardely receiued with the
bodily mouthe: but in the Fleashe and Bloud of Christe, whiche onely are recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
spiritually into the soule.</p>
               <p>He addeth further, <hi>Whole Christe is vnder either kinde: therefore he that receiueth in one

rather haue béene beléeued. But M. Hardinge of false Principles of his owne,
thinketh he may boldely geather the like Conclusions. These toyes are sufficient
to please vayne fantasie: but they are not sufficient to content a godly conscience.
But dooth M. Harding so surely know, that whole Christe is in either kinde, and
did Christe him selfe not know it? Or if Christe did know it, was not he hable to
breake his owne ordinance, &amp; to prouide for this inconuenience, as wel as others?
We know, and it is our beléefe, that Christes whole Humanitie both Fleashe and
Bloud is in Heauen. But that the same humanitie of Christ is in the Sacrament,
in suche grosse sorte, as is supposed by our aduersaries, notwithstandinge many
bolde vauntes thereof made, yet was it hitherto neuer proued. And although this
mater be moued by M. Harding out of season, as being no parte of this Question,

it is easie for any man to consider, if <hi>Consentius</hi> had béene perswaded, as M. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge
woulde séeme to be, that Christes Body hath Bloud in it in the Sacrament,
he woulde neuer haue mooued this question of the Body of Christe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is in Heauen.
To leaue these new fantasies, whereof it dooth not appeare, that euer the olde
Catholike Doctours made any reporte, wée must vnderstande, that the Breade is
the Sacrament of Christes Body, and the Wine is the Sacrament of his Bloud.

by way of Sacrament, but the fleashe onely vnder the forme of Breade, and the

vnder one kinde, receiueth, not the ful Sacrament, nor the Bloud of Christe
by way of Sacrament: and that their dooinge therein is of lesse strength &amp; merite,
then the dooinge of the Priest. Wherefore M. Hardinge in sayeinge <hi>The people recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge
onely vnder one kinde taketh no iniurie,</hi> doothe the people double iniurie.</p>
               <p>But to passe ouer these Scholastical subtile pointes, it behoueth vs to know,
that Christe the Sonne of God, appointed the Sacrament of his Body to be geuen
in Breade, and the Sacrament of his Bloud to be geuen in Wine. These be the
holy Mysteries of Christes Body and Bloud. Wee may not here accompte what
may be in either of them by the drifte of vaine fantasie: but rather wée ought to
consider, what Christe in the first Institution hereof did, and what he commaunded
to be doone. Neither doo wee here condemne the Church, as it pleaseth M. Harding
vniustly to charge vs: but wee wishe, and pray to God, that his whole Churche
may once be reformed after the example and Institution of Christe: without whom
the Churche is no Churche: neither hath any right, or claime without his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse:
nor any promisse without his woorde.</p>
               <p>Nowe, whereas M. Hardinge saieth, <hi>The reasons that we make for the maintenaunce of

that side haue taken of mennes Beardes, of feare of the Palsie and shakinge, or
other diseases, or inconueniences that may happen: but euen of the same, that he
hath here planted in the firste ranke, and entrie of his cause. The firste is this:</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>The thirde is this:</hi> Whole Christe (<hi>as M. Hardinge saithe</hi>) is in eyther parte of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>

al this concludeth not directly, That therefore Christes ordinaunce may be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.
Neither is it yet so clearely proued, that the priest in his Masse represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
the separation of Christes Bloude from his Bodie. For, beside that there is
no auncient Doctour here alleged for proufe hereof, I might wel demaunde, by
what woordes, by what gesture, or to whom dooth he represent this Separation?
His woordes be strange: his gesture secrete: the people neither heareth, nor seeth
ought, nor knoweth what he meaneth. And beinge graunted, that the Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Christes Body and Bloude, is represented in the holy Mysteries, yet howe
knoweth M. Hardinge, that the priest ought more to represent the same, then the
people? Doubtlesse Christes Bloude was shedde indifferently for al the faithful,
as wel for the People, as for the Priest: betwéene whom and the people, as I haue
before shewed out of S. Chrysostome,<note place="margin">Chrysost in. 2. ad Corin. Hom. 18.</note> in this case there is no difference. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
M. Hardinge taketh the name of Sacrifice for some shewe of proufe in this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
it behoueth him to knowe, that not onely the portion receiued by the priest,
but also the portion that is distributed vnto the people, is of the olde Fathers cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a Sacrifice. S. Augustine hath these woordes, <hi>In Carthage the manner was, that

               </p>
               <p>By these plaine woordes we may sée, that bothe the priest and people receiued one

<hi>When the Oblation is broken, and the Bloud from the cuppe is powred into the mouthes of

               <p>The first is this, The prieste Consecrateth the Sacrament: Therefore the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>

               <p>The seconde is this, The priest offereth the Sacrifice, and representeth the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
separation of Christes Bodie and Bloude: <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is sufficient for the
people to receiue in one kinde.</p>

               <p>When I reade these woordes of M. Hardinges, I am striken with horrour,
to consider the terrible iudgement of God. It is muche to be feared, that he, that

S. Paule, yet the very practise, and continual order of the Primitiue Churche,

him.</p>
               <p>Once againe he bringeth foorthe Clement the Apostles fellowe. And what
Clement? Uerily euen the same, that ministred and deliuered the holy Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the faithful, that then were in Rome, vnder bothe kindes, as appeareth by
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:12563:64"/>
the longe vsage of that Churche, euen as Christe deliuered it to his Disciples: and
M. Hardinge is not hable to shewe, that the same Clemente euer ministred other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.
He seeth, &amp; knoweth, that the woorde <hi>Omnes,</hi> is against him: the meaninge
against him: The practise of the Churche against him: his owne Clement against
him. Yet he beareth his countenance so, as if al were with him. To be shorte,
if Christ, when he saide, <hi>Drinke ye al,</hi> meant not that al shoulde drinke, why did S.
Paule and al the Apostles, and the whole primitiue Churche expounde it, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise it, as though he had meante so: And if he meante so, why dothe M. Hardinge
deceiue the worlde, and say, <hi>he meante not so?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Clement saithe, <hi>Christe spake these woordes, <hi>doo this in my remembrance,</hi> onely
vnto the Apostles. Therefore</hi> (saieth M. Hardinge) <hi>These woordes, <hi>drinke ye al,</hi> pertaine to

place here alleged, speaketh not one woorde, either of one kinde, or of bothe: but
onely saithe thus, <hi>That Christe appointed his Apostles to the office of the holie Ministration,</hi>
whiche he calleth the spiritual oblation. Therefore thou maiste sée,<note place="margin">Spiritualis hostia.</note> that M. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge

               <p>The argument that hereof is geathered, standeth thus: Clement saithe, that
Christe gaue onely vnto his Apostles, the office of the Ministerie, and authoritie to
offer the spiritual Sacrifice, <hi>Ergo,</hi> these woordes, <hi>drinke ye al of this,</hi> perteine no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge

directly vnto the Sacramental or Corporal eatinge. For it was spoken longe before the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
was ordeined. Therefore out of this letter, there cannot be made any good argument
for the Sacramental Communion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Likewise one Michael Uaehe one of late yéeres,</hi>

                  <hi>a man of M. Hardinges owne
side, toutchinge the same mater, writeth thus: <hi>Infirmum est argumentum: Quae e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim

                  </hi> This <hi>(saieth he)</hi>
is but a weake reason: For the woordes that be spoken of spiritual eatinge, he applieth to
the Sacramental eatinge. <hi>Here may M. Hardinge sée, bisides S. Augustine, Origen, &amp;
other olde Catholike Fathers, whose woordes I haue not alleged, what menne he
hath called</hi> newe Maisters. <hi>Nicolas Lyra was an Englishe man, and liued two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
yéeres before Luther: Michael Uaehe was of late yéeres, and wrote namely
against Luther. Uerely if Christe and his Apostles were nowe conuersante in
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:12563:65"/>
the worlde, onlesse they woulde forsake their owne doctrine, they shoulde be called</hi>
Newe Maisters to, <hi>as wel as others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And not withstandinge these woordes in the sixth Chapter of S. Iohn be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and taken, of the spiritual eatinge, as it is alreadie proued, yet are they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
by the olde Fathers applied vnto the Sacrament: but vndirectly, as it is
aboue noted by <hi>Lyra.</hi> To allege the places, specially beinge so many, and not
vnknowen vnto the learned, it woulde be tedious. Christes beinge at <hi>Emaus,</hi>
and the Disciples breakinge of Breade at Hierusalem, bicause it hath pleased M.
Hardinge to bringe them twise, shal be afterwarde answeared in their places.</p>
               <p>The reasons, that M. Harding hath here geathered, be these: <hi>In the sixth Chapter
of <hi>S.</hi> Iohn there is no mention made of the Cuppe or VVine: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the people may receiue vnder one
kinde.</hi> This reason is very weake: for he may as wel conclude of the same woordes:
<hi>Ergo,</hi> the Priest may receiue vnder one kinde: whiche he him selfe saith is against
Christes Institution. He might farre better haue concluded the contrary.
The laye people beinge faithful &amp; godly, by Faithe, and in their hartes doo in déede
and verely drinke the Bloude of Christe: Therefore they may drinke the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ame. And as Eckius a Doctour of that side saithe,<note place="margin">Eckius, In locis communibus.</note> 
                  <hi>The people drinketh
in the person of the Prieste,</hi> Therefore, they may drinke in their owne person, as
wel, and without daunger.</p>
               <p>An other reason is this: It doothe not appeare, that Christe euer ministred in
Both Kindes, but onely to his Disciples: <hi>Ergo,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> people may receiue in one kinde.
I maruel, what lucke M. Hardinge hath to such Conclusions. For what necessarie
sequele can there be, either from thapostles to the people: or from bothe kindes to
one kinde: or from an Affirmatiue to a Negatiue? The summe of the reason stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
thus: Thapostles are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded to receiue Both Kindes: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the people is
not commaunded to receiue Bothe Kindes. The weakenesse whereof is euident, &amp;
sheweth it selfe. It wil much rather &amp; better follow thus: The people is commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to receiue, as Thapostles receiued, for there is expressed no difference: The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
receiued in bothe kindes: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the people is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded to receiue in both
kindes. And thus, notwithstanding it be here stoutely auoutched, that we haue
neither example, nor Institution, yet I truste it doothe wel appeare, that we haue
bothe the example of Christe, that ministred the Sacrament in bothe kindes: and
also Christes Institution, that bade his Disciples to doo the same.</p>

rehearse them, that the vnlearned may see, how them selues make not so great a mater of this article,
as some seeme to beare the people in hande it is. Luther writeth to them of Bohemiae these very
woordes. <hi>Quoniam pulchrum quidem esset, vtraque specie Eucharistiae vti, &amp; Christus hac

faire thinge (saieth he) to vse both kindes of the Sacrament, yet for that Christe herein hath
commaunded nothinge, as necessarie, it were better to kepe peace and vnitie, which Christe hath
euery where charged vs with al, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to striue for the outwarde kindes of the Sacrament. Againe
his woordes be these in a declaration that he wrote of the Sacrament. <hi>Non dixi, neque consului,

Neither haue I saide, nor counsailed, nor my minde is, that any one, or moe Bishops, beginne

he thought it good merily to refreashe him selfe: &amp; yet touchinge inconstancie,
wherein he so triumpheth against D. Luther, he séemeth vtterly to haue forgotten

changed but once; &amp; that from manifest errour to the open confessed trueth. But M.

And here cannot M. Hardinge steale away in the miste, &amp; say, S.
Cyprian meante al this of the Cuppe, that the Priest consecrateth for him selfe: for
his very woordes be plaine to the contrary. <hi>In Calice Dominico sanctificando, &amp; plebi

VVho so euer readeth his bookes with indifferent iudgement, shal finde that sithens the Apostles
time, neuer wrote man so arrogantly, ne so dispitefully against the Churche, nor so contrarily to him

it is also to vse, whiche parte of the signe a man listeth. By the woorde, <hi>Signe,</hi> he meaneth the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
likinge better that straunge woorde, then the accustomed woorde of the Churche: least he might
perhaps be thought of the bretherne of his secte, in some what to ioyne with the Catholikes.</p>
               <p>Bucer also is of the same opinion, who in the conference that was had betweene the Catholikes and
protestantes for agreement in controuersies of religion at Ratisbone, confirmed, and allowed this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
by his ful consent with these woordes: <hi>Ad controuersiam quae est de vna aut vtraque spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,

That the controuersie for the one, or both kindes, may be taken away, it shal be very wel done,
that holie Churche made it free, to receiue this Sacrament in one or both kindes: yet vnder suche
condition, as hereby no occasion be geuen to any bodie, rashely to condemne the vse, whiche the
Churche hath so longe time keapte, nor to iudge one an other. Soothly he whiche would haue it
free and at libertie, to receiue the Sacrament vnder one or bothe kindes, and holdeth opinion, that the
olde custome of the one kinde onely is not to be condemned, seemeth plainely yenough to confesse, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge
hath beene instituted or commaunded of Christ toutchinge this mater, as necessarie to saluation.</p>
               <p>Thus we may see plainely, that they whiche haue diuided them selues from the Mystical bodie of
Christe, that is, his Churche, who were of greatest learninge and iudgement, make it a mater indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
(as it is in deede of it selfe lefte to the libertie of the Churche) whether the Sacrament be mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred
vnder one kinde, or bothe. And thus much hath ben confessed against <hi>M.</hi> Iuel, and his secte, not
onely by the learned aduersaries of the Churche in our time, but also by a learned ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Bohemia aboue

them, nor to holde them for Heretiques. But if it be the commaundement of God, that the Sacrament be
receiued of al vnder bothe kindes, why shoulde he be forbidden by the feare of God, to condemne those

               <p>Hereby it may appeare, that this woorde <hi>Signe,</hi> is not so strange, as M. Hardinge
would haue it séeme, nor so vnaccustomed vnto the Churche. Although it misse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
him, that we should doo, as the olde Fathers did, yet he might geue vs leaue, to
vse suche woordes, and phrases, as the olde Fathers vsed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But</hi> (he saithe) <hi>Melancthon, and Bucer accompted it as a thinge indifferent.</hi> In deede
these godly learned men, when they saw, that through the malice of their aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
they coulde not obteine, that Christes Institution might vniuersally be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued,
yet they desired at the least, it might be leafte free without restrainte, for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
Churche to doo therein, as they shoulde thinke good, and that without mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure,
or offence of others. And thus farre foorthe their desire was, it might be
iudged free: not that they thought, Christe had not ordeined the Sacrament to be
ministred vnto the people in bothe kindes, or that in it selfe it is indifferent: but
that the faithful of God might indifferently, and freely vse it without controle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and that it should not be iudged Heresie, to doo as Christe had commaunded.</p>
               <p>So the godly Fathers at the beginninge, when they coulde not perswade the
Princes of the worlde, with their people, to receiue the Gospel, yet they thought
they were gainers, and gaue God thankes, when they might haue place, and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
for them selues, freely, and with quiet conscience, to meete togeather, and to
preache the Gospell.</p>
               <p>This libertie M. Hardinge cannot like with al. He woulde haue it free for the
whole Churche to determine of it: but not for euery Churche particular. This is
a shifte to deceiue the ignorant. For he knoweth wel, that al other Churches
throughout the worlde, from the firste plantinge of the Gospel vntil this day, doo
stil minister the Holie Communion in Bothe Kindes, as Christe commaunded:
and that Christes Institution was neuer openly, and by consente broaken, but
onely in the Churche of Rome: whiche Churche also is not vniuersal, but meere
particular: and that the same breache in the same Churche of Rome, sprange not
of any consent of Bishoppes, or other learned men, but, as it is prooued before,
onely of the simple deuotion of the people. And doothe M. Hardinge thinke, the
people may safely breake Christes Institution without any General Councel: and
may not safely returne againe to the same, without a general Councel? Uerely
there needeth no Councel, where as nothinge is donne by Councel.</p>

the Prince of <hi>Mensburg.</hi> And therefore these collections doo witnesse his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
but not his iudgement. As touchinge that note concerninge the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> it may be thought, he had it out of <hi>Alardus,</hi> or <hi>Michael Vaehe,</hi> or

               <p>
                  <hi>Nestorius <hi>emongst other errours</hi>
                  </hi> (saithe M. Hardinge) <hi>helde opinion, that vnder the
forme of Breade in the Sacrament is conteined the Body of Christe without his Bloud, and vnder the
forme of wyne, the Bloud onely, without his Body.</hi> Why shoulde this man thus delite
him selfe, to vpholde one falsehead with an other? First he saithe, <hi>The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
of <hi>Ephesus</hi> decreed against Bothe Kindes.</hi> This is vntrue, and was neuer yet
prooued. Next, some cause must be diuised, that shoulde leade the Fathers to
that Decrée. Whiche, as it is here surmised, was this errour of Nestorius. A
cause that neuer was, is good yenough to prooue the effecte, that neuer was. Thus
is M. Hardinge driuen not onely to forge New Doctours, and New Decrées of
Councels, but also to imagine New Heresies, such as were neuer hearde of before:
euen in like sorte, &amp; to like purpose, as by some it is supposed, that Aristotle some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
imagined straunge, and monstrous opinions to be taught by Democritus,
Parmenides, Melyssus, and other olde Philosophers: not bicause they had euer
taught, or written so in déede, but to the ende to finde occasion of talke, and the
better to set abroade his owne learninge. If it be true, that is surmised by Nesto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,
then M. Hardinges whole defence standeth but vpon an Heresie: if it be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true,
as in deede it is, then it standeth vpon an open falsehead: and so, whether it
be true, or false, it hath a very weake fundation.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Nestorius,</hi> it is knowen, he was a wicked, and a blasphemous Heretique,
and was woorthely condemned by sundrie holy Fathers and Councelles. Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strius,
Epiphanius, and S. Augustine, haue written namely of his errours:</p>
               <p>The Councel of Ephesus, the Councel of Chalcedon, Coelestinus, Gelasius, Leo,
Bishops of Rome, Cyrillus Bishop of Alexandria, haue ripte vp, and condemned
al the braunches of his Heresies. Yet none of them al euer charged <hi>Nestorius</hi> with
this newe Heresie of M. Hardinges makinge. If there had béene in it any shewe
of truethe, M. Hardinge, as he is eloquente, woulde haue layed out al the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
When this strange errour first beganne, Where, and Howe longe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued,
Who wrote againste it, and by Whom, and in What Councel it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.
Uerely this great silence declareth some wante. It must néedes be a very
strange Heresie, that neuer had neither beginninge, nor endinge: nor defender,
nor reprouer: nor mouthe to vtter it: nor eare to heare it: nor penne to write it:
nor time to last in: nor place to reast in. And if al this had béene true of <hi>Nesto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:12563:69"/>
yet had it béene no reason, that for any one mans priuate errour, Christes
Institution shoulde be broken.</p>
               <p>But that the vayne folie and manifest falshead of these men may appeare, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande
(Good Reader) that where as <hi>Nestorius</hi> dwelte, and his Heresie tooke
place, in those countreis they haue euermore kepte Christes Institution in bothe
kindes: but in these countreis, where as neither the name of <hi>Nestorius</hi> was euer
hearde of, but onely vnto a fewe, nor his Heresie euer receiued, there haue they
made greate Prouisoes against <hi>Nestorius,</hi> yea a thousande yéeres after <hi>Nestorius</hi>
was dead. The reast of the causes whiche he calleth so weighty,
are scarcely woorthe any answeare. <hi>Some men dooe lothe wine: some people can

whole worlde shal Communicate in one kinde.</hi> If the Conclusion had béene, that suche as

tolerable. For, as it is wel noted by Pomponius,<note place="margin">De legib. &amp; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natuscon. &amp; lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <hi>Lawes must touche thinges that
happen commonly, and for the most parte, not thinges that happen to fewe, or seldome.</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,
the like reason may be made for the Priestes: some Priestes by meane of
disease can taste no wine: some in certaine countreis can hardely geate, some can
hardely kéepe wyne: therefore it were wel prouided, that al priestes shoulde mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
vnder one kinde. Certainely where as wine may be prouided for the priest,
there may also wine be prouided for the people. For it were straunge to heare, that
a carte, or a whole shippe, shoulde come loaden onely with one bottle of wine into
a countrie.</p>
               <p>Some saye, that the Priestes in Ruscia for lacke of wine,<note place="margin">Cornel. Agrippa de vani. scientia. Volateranus.</note> vsed to Consecrate
in Metheglen: Some other saye, that Innocentius the eighth, for the like wante,
dispensed with the Priestes of Norweye to Consecrate without wine. It were no
reason to bynde the whole Churche to the necessitie, or imbecillitie of a fewe. For
otherwise the same wante, and impossibilitie, that M. Hardinge hath here founde
for the one parte of the Sacrament, may be founde also for the other.<note place="margin">Arrianus. lib. 8. Strabo.</note> For <hi>Arria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus

necessary by this Conclusion, that in consideration of them, the whole Churche

yeres, and therefore his authoritie herein must weigh the lighter. Neither dooth
he so cal it according to the nature, and common Definition of a Sacrament. For
neither was there any certaine element namely chosen, nor any special woordes
appointed to make it a Sacrament, nor any promisse of Grace thereto annexed.

                  </hi> (saith M. Hardinge) <hi>this commaundement byndeth

                  </hi> How may a man trust M. Hardinge in
the darke, that wil thus deceiue him in the light? For he knoweth that the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shinge
of feete was neither Institution of Christe, nor any parte of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
nor specially appointed to be doone by the Apostles, nor the breache thereof
euer déemed Sacriledge,<note place="margin">De Con. dist. 2. Comperimus.</note> as Gelasius writeth of this disorder of the halfe Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
Whether the Apostles for any time after Christes Resurrection obserued
it or no, it appeareth not. Neither is there any thing, to my remembrance, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
of it.<note place="margin">1. Timoth 5.</note> As wée may perceiue by S. Paule, it was an office more belonging vnto
wemen, then vnto men. And it séemeth by S. Augustine, that this Ceremonie in
the Churche had relation vnto some other cause, and not vnto the Institution of
Christe, neither to the example or practise of the Apostles. For thus he writeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his fréende Ianuarius touching the same:<note place="margin">Augustin. ad Ianuar. Epist. 118</note> 
                  <hi>If thou demaunde, vpon what considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
this Ceremonie of washinge feete beganne first, notwithstandinge I haue wel thought of
it, yet can I finde nothinge, that seemeth more likely, then this: for that the bodies of them
that had appointed to be Baptized</hi> (at Easter) <hi>being il chearished by reason of the Le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ten fast,
woulde haue had some lothsomnesse in the touchinge, onlesse they had beene washte at some
time before: And that therefore they chose this day chiefely to that purpose, vpon whiche day
the Lordes Supper is yerely celebrate.</hi> Here S. Augustine saithe, it was the fulsom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the bodies, and lothsomnesse of the senses, that first began this Ceremonie,
and not the Institution or commaundement of Christ. But as touchinge the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of the Communion in Bothe Kindes, it is most certaine, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apostles
vsed it, and that Christ commaunded it to be vsed stil vntil his comminge.</p>
               <p>With what indifferent iudgement then can M. Hardinge thus compare these
thinges togeather: a Sacrament, with no Sacrament: an Institution, with no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution:
a thing, that in the Primitiue Church was euery where vsed, with that
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:12563:71"/>
thing, wherof no proufe can be made, that vpon Christes commaundement it was
euer vsed. Neither did Christe therefore so abase him selfe, to washe his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
féete, to the intente they according to the letter should doo the same: but in him
selfe to shew them a perfite example of humilitie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For they were yet in a déepe
dreame, that Christe should come like a Kinge with al worldly Maiestie, and that
they should be Princes,<note place="margin">Matthae. 20.</note> &amp; sit with him to rule the worlde. Therfore to breake them
out of this sleape, he tooke vpon him this vile and seruile office, that they might sée,
that his comming was to serue them, and therefore might learne humilitie, by his
example one of them to serue an other.<note place="margin">Matth. 18.</note> In like manner Christe set a childe before
his Disciples,<note place="margin">Math. 10.</note> &amp; willed them al to be as children. He bad them to shake of the dust
from their shoes,<note place="margin">Matth. 8.</note> &amp; to carie neither rodde nor scrippe aboute them, and to salute no
man vpon the way: not that they shoulde practise these thinges according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> woordes, but to the intent y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by the same, they might be induced to a déeper
vnderstanding. Such, was the Sacrament, and meaning of the Washing of féete.</p>
               <p>The reasons that follow, are of like value. For Christ said not, Doo this after
supper, or sittinge, or at a table, or beinge so many togeather: Neither did the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
euer so vnderstande his woordes. But when he had Ministred the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
vnto his Apostles in Bothe Kindes, he bade them doo the same, that he had
doone: and so they vnderstoode his woordes, and Ministred the Sacrament vnto
the people in Bothe kindes accordingly.</p>
               <p>The woordes of S. Cyprian here alleged, are spoken of sprinkeling, or powring
on water ouer them, that were Baptized: which is but a Ceremonie, and therefore
ought to be at libertie, and is not of the substance of Baptisme. Neither dooth it
follow, <hi>Wee may breake a Ceremonie, <hi>Ergo,</hi> wee may breake the substance of Christes Institution.</hi>
This reason rather maketh against M. Harding and his fellowes. For if <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
should be vsed freely, and without rigour,</hi> as S. Cyprian saith, why then be they so
precise in their Oyle, their Balme, their Lightes, and other thinges of like value, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
be the abuse thereof neuer so greate, yet they wil remitte nothinge? And if they be
so precise, and so earnest in Ceremonies, &amp; diuises of their owne, how muche more
ought wée to be earnest, in maters touching the essential forme of the Institution
of Christe?</p>

to be keapte, then <hi>Berengarius, VViclefe, Hus, Luther, Zuinglius, Caluine, Cranmere, Peter

that no othe ought to be geuen or made in no case or respecte: likewise that in no case or respecte,
a man may doo an other to death: and also that after the outwarde letter of the Gospel, sometime a man
is bounde to pul out his eye, and cast it from him: whiche thinge hath been doone by some of the <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardes,</hi>
as it is reported, as though els Gods commaundement were not keapte: this hath so beene
vnderstanded by the Catholyke Churche confessing neuerthelesse these to be Gods commaundementes, as

drinke of this Cuppe, of necessitie, howe is it come to passe, that our aduersaries them selues (who
pretende so streighte a conscience herein) keepe from it infantes, and yonge children, vntil they come to
good yeeres of discretion: specially where as the Custome of the Primitiue Churche was, that they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
shoulde be partakers of this Sacrament, as it may plainely be seene in <hi>S.</hi> Dionyse, Cyprian, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine,

Touchinge Oathes, it is forbidden, that any shal sweare vnaduisedly, or without

               <p>The pullinge out of the eye is an allegorie, wherein by a figure, or manner
of speache, one thinge is conceiued of an other: and Christes meaninge is, that
who so wil followe him, must pul out, and cast from him his affections, his goodes,
and his fréendes for the Gospelles sake, ye though he loue them as his eyes. And

but onely of charitie, to beare with the weakenes of the Iewes, vntil they
might growe to a perfite knowlege in Christe: duringe whiche weakenes, this
charitable order amonge the rest of the faithful Christians, continued stil, as may
appeare by Tertullian, by Arnobius, by Eusebius, by Oecumenius, and others.
But after that the Iewes were throughly perswaded, that al creatures of God
were cleane, this forbearinge, whiche beganne onely for their sakes, had an ende.</p>
               <p>But howe can M. Hardinge applie these thinges to his purpose? Or howe can
he hereby, warrante the manifest breache of Christes Institution? The Churche
in euery of these orders was directed, and guided by Goddes woorde: Touchinge

meates, Christe saithe, <hi>The thinge that entreth into the mouthe, defileth not the man:</hi> And

               <p>Nowe of the other parte, let M. Hardinge shewe, what Woorde of God the

did Christe, or his Apostles euer saye, Let not the people receiue the whole Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as it was ordeined at the first, but let it be sufficient for them to receiue one

               <p>Howe be it in the meane time, while these Doctours can better agrée, it cannot be
denied, but Christe ministred vnto his Disciples the whole Sacrament in Bothe
Kindes, &amp; gaue them in charge, in plaine expresse woordes, to doo the same. But of
the halfe Communion in one kinde, Christe neither gaue them charge, nor spake
any one woorde at al. If M. Hardinge wil replie, that Christes woordes in this

the order, that was practised by Thapostles, &amp; Olde Fathers, and also the contrary
order, that of late hath béene practised in the Churche of Rome, then had Christe at
one time, and in the vtteringe of one sentence, not onely twoo, but also diuers and
contrary meaninges: and so by M. Hardinges iudgement, Christe must néedes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strue

               <p>Yée saye, <hi>The priestes are bounde of necessitie to receiue Bothe Kindes: but the Laye people
is not bounde:</hi> and so ye conclude, that Christe ordeined two sundrie Communions,
the one not like the other: the one for the priestes, the other for the people. And
therfore by your aduise,<note place="margin">Hieronym.</note> we must correcte S. Hierome,<note place="margin">1. Corinth. 11. Chrysost.</note> that saithe:<note place="margin">2. Corinth. 18.</note>

               <p>The obiection that is made of keepinge children from the Communion, is but

nor breake any parte of Christes Institution: no more then when by order of
Excommunication, we remoue the wicked from the whole vse of the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>For notwithstandinge it appeare by S. Augustine, S. Cyprian, and others,
that Infantes in the Primitiue Churche in sundrie places were admitted to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Communion, yet afterwarde vpon good aduise, they were iustly remoued from
it: bicause that beinge in that age, they were not thought hable to examine and

proue them selfes accordinge to the doctrine of S. Paule, and so to eate of that
Breade, and to drinke of that Cuppe. In like sorte in the lawe of Moses, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standinge
al menchildren were commaunded to be Circumcised, yet none were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to eate the Passeouer, but onely suche as coulde demaund, what it meante.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Churche</hi> (saithe M. Hardinge) <hi>is the interpreter of Gods minde. The Churche knoweth,
that this was not Christes Insttrution.</hi> Uerily if the Churche knowe it nowe at laste, she
hath beene longe in learninge this lesson. For the olde Catholike Churche, as it
is wel knowen, tooke it farre otherwise, and that folowinge the plaine woordes of
God, whereby Gods ordinary way is to reuele his minde: and bicause Christe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred
vnto his Disciples in Bothe kindes, and commaunded them to doo the same,
therefore that Churche vnderstoode him, euen as his woordes sounded, and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred

                  </gap> Augustine say, that Christe ministred
the halfe Sacrament to his Disciples in One Kinde onely. But saith M. Harding,
<hi>Luke speaketh onely of the Breade: <hi>Ergo,</hi> There was no wine.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:12563:75"/>
This argument may be good in M. Hardinges Diuinitie, but it is of smal force in
good Logique.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As for your Synecdoche, whereby of the parte ye vnderstande the whole</hi> (saieth M. Hardinge)
<hi>It is but a patche of your diuise, and wil not serue.</hi> Yet S. Augustine, S. Gregorie, Bede,
Iulianus, Dionysius, Lyra, Wideforde, and others that vnderstande these woordes
of S. Luke of hospitalitie, must néedes craue the warrant of a figure, and vnder the
name of Breade must néedes conceiue meate, and Wine also: otherwise there had
beene a very simple, and a drie feast. Now if M. Hardinge can allowe them the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
of Synecdoche, why may not he as wel allow vs the same? It is a manner of
speache commonly vsed in al the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But Christe streight way vanished from their sight vpon the breakinge of the Breade: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
had no leasure to deliuer the other portion: neither is their any mention made of the Cuppe.</hi> O
what miserable straites these menne be driuen into? To make vp their tale, they
are gladde to say, that Christ lackte leasure. <hi>But there is nothinge written of the Cuppe.</hi>
I graunte. Neither is there any thinge there written, that Christe did Consecrate
the Breade. And this place is priuileged aboue al others. We muste conceiue no
more of it, then is spoken. Then was there a Sacrament without Consecration.
Neither is there any thinge there written, that either Christ him selfe, or the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
did eate the Breade. Thus hath M. Hardinge with muche a doo founde out
at last, not a Communion of One Kinde, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he sought for, but a Communion of No
Kinde at al. And so haue we a Sacrament without Sacrament: and a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
without Communion.</p>
               <p>What shal I say further? If I graunte M. Hardinge his whole demaunde, yet
hath he wonne nothinge against me: but very muche against him selfe. For the
question is moued of Lay people: M. Hardinge bringeth examples of Christe and
two Disciples, who were of the number of the seuentie and two, that were sente

and ministred onely in One Kinde: for here is no manner mention of the Cuppe.

Fishe, and of the Hony combe. And other proufe thereof there is none brought,
but woordes, and boldenesse. For shew and countenaunce of somewhat, there is
brought foorth the Gospel of S. Matthew, and that written in Hebrew, as though
S. Matthew had written twoo Gospels, in twoo sundrie tongues: and not onely
twoo, but also diuers. I know, it is thought of some, that S. Matthew wrote his
Gospel in Hebrew, &amp; by reporte of Theophylactus, S. Iohn the Euangelist tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated
the same into Greeke. But that there should be any contrarietie, or diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie
of storie, or mater, as M. Hardinge séemeth to meane, I haue not hearde.</p>

so he speaketh not one woorde of S. Matthew. Whiche thinge addeth some
more distrust to M. Hardinges dealing. S. Hierome onely nameth the Gospel of
the Hebrewes, which (he saith) he him selfe translated both into Gréeke and Latin,
and is often alleged by Origen.<note place="margin">Euseb. lib. 3. ca. 25.</note> But Eusebius accompteth it for no Gospel, but
onely amonge the bastarde Scriptures.</p>
               <p>How be it, what so euer the credite of the Booke be, thus it is written: <hi>Christe
tooke Breade and blist it, and brake it. <hi>Here</hi>
                  </hi> (saith M. Harding) <hi>no man can doubte,
but it was the Sacrament.</hi> I sée wel he woulde faine haue it so. Yet is there here nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the Hebrewes Gospel, nor by S. Hierome, any one woorde spoaken of the
Sacrament. Neither had S. Iames vowed, that he woulde not minister, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
the Communion, but that he woulde eate no Common Breade, before he
had seene Christe risen againe from the dead. As for the blessynge of the Breade, it
was not a thinge peculiar to the Sacrament, but a general manner that Christe
obserued, when so euer be vsed Goddes creatures, as it may appeare throughout
the storie of the Gospels. That Christe should then minister the Sacrament,
it is but M. Hardinges gheasse. No olde writer euer saw so muche before, no not
S. Hierome, that wrote the storie. Yet M. Harding, as though he had learned it in
the thirde heauen, saith, <hi>It is so plaine, that no man may doubt of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But be it the Sacrament: <hi>Ergo</hi> (saith M. Hardinge) <hi>There was but one kinde.</hi> And
how may that be proued? Now must one gheasse healpe an other. <hi>For it is likely</hi>
(saith M. Harding) <hi>that there was no wine in the house.</hi> And why so? <hi>Bycause <hi>S.</hi> Iames dranke
no wine.</hi> If gheasses goe for argumentes, this mater is doone. How be it, it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
a very séely gheasse, to say, <hi>S. Iames dranke no wine, <hi>Ergo,</hi> He had no wine in his house.</hi>
Uerely the same Egesippus,<note place="margin">Egesippus. Abdias libro. 6.</note> that saithe, S. Iames neuer dranke wine, saithe also,
<hi>That he neuer was annointed, neuer ware woollen clothe, neuer eate fleashe in al his life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hereof by M. Hardinges Logique wée may conclude, that he had neither oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

reserued, as M. Hardinge séemeth to geather vpon a false texte, being nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

holy Mysteries, and deliuer the same vnto the people, as may wel be geathered by
the woordes of Rufine. But let vs graunt M. Hardinge, that the Sacrament
was reserued. Yet hath he gotten very smal aduantage for his halfe Communion.

not hable to come him selfe, gaue to the ladde that came of that errant, a litle of the Sacrament,
commaunding him to weate it, and so being moisted to powre it into the olde mans mouthe. Thus much
is expressed by the woordes there, as the Greeke is to be construed.<note place="margin">

moisted with some liquor that diuine meate, to serue the olde man withal, licinge now pantinge for
desier to be dimissed hence, and to hast him away to Heauen, and powred it into his mouthe. For that
this olde mannes mouthe and throte, had longe benne drie by force of his sickenesse, the Priest, who

and so togeather to powre it into his mouthe. Which was so doone by the ladde, as Dionysius expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth.
Now if the forme of wine had then also been brought by the ladde to be ministred, there had
been no neede of suche Circumstance, to procure the olde man a moisture to swallow downe that holy
foode. And that this was the manner of ministring the Sacrament to olde men at their departinge,

they may be admitted to shewe their repentance (for their open crimes) euery man desiringe

of deathe, the partie excommunicate shoulde not tarie to be reconciled by the Bishop (in the
presence of the Churche, as the order was then) but discharge him selfe before any Deacon, and
so departe vnto the Lorde in peace.</hi> Therefore the priest vnderstandinge the state,
the olde man Serapion beinge excommunicate stoode in, and beynge not hable for
sickenesse to goe him selfe, leaste he shoulde departe confortelesse in desperation, in
token that he was reconciled vnto the Churche, sente vnto him the sacrament by

whom M. Hardinge highly commendeth for his holinesse, not withstandinge he
were the founder of the Messalians,<note place="margin">Theodoret. li. 4. Cap. 11.</note> and therfore, as he afterwarde saithe, the firste

and Bassus was faine to washe Simeones mouth, <hi>Ergo,</hi> they receiued in one kinde.</hi> Uerily,
Serapions boye were soone hable to answeare this argument. For what sequele

               <p>As for the fable of M. Hardinges Amphilochius, it were greate wronge to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweare
it otherwise then as a Fable. For thus it is: <hi>The Breade had beene keapte by
the space of seuen yeeres, or more: <hi>S.</hi> Basile in his deathe bedde called for it, and receiued it, to
thentent,</hi> as M. Hardinge saithe, <hi>it might be buried with him.</hi> The former parte here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
to say, either that the Sacrament was kepte the space of seuen yéeres, or that at
the ende of so longe time, it was fitte to be receiued of a sicke manne in his deathe
bedde, is méere folie. But to say as M. Hardinge here saithe, that the Bodie of
Christe beinge nowe immortal, and glorious, and at the right hande of God may
be layed in the graue, and buried, is manifest and wicked blasphemie. Abdias saith,
that S. Mathie thapostle when he was stoaned to death, desired that twoo of the
firste stoanes might be buried with him, for a witnesse against them, that so vsed
him: who, although he be ful of like fables, yet hath he some reason in his fables:
but M. Hardinges Amphilochius hath none at al.</p>
               <p>Nowe for viewe of M. Hardinges proufes, good Reader, consider this. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde

demaunde of the vsage of the Church: he answeareth of personnes excommunicate,
that were without the Churche. I demaunde of sufficient and certaine proufes: he
answeareth me by gheasses and fables. And these be his inuincible argumentes,

and exhorted his wife, to conforme her selfe to the same iudgement also. But when as she
was ledde by the talke of noble wemen, rather then by her husbandes good aduertisementes, after

this, promisinge fainedly, that she woulde agree vnto it, conferreth the mater with a woman seruant
that she had, whome she esteamed for trustie, and vseth her helpe to deceiue her husbande. About
the time of the Mysteries, she holdinge fast that whiche she had receiued, s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the woman sore astonied, fearinge leasie some euil shoulde happen vnto her therefore, whiche came by
the power of God, ranne foorthwith to the Bishop, and bewrayinge her selfe, sheweth him the stone,
hauinge yet in it the printes of her bitte, representinge a strange mater, and a wonderous colour: and
so with teares of her eyes, besought forgiuenes, promisinge her husbande she would consent and agree

               <p>I may not disgrace the credite of this storie: al be it in Sozomenus, and Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus,
of bothe whome the same is recorded, there be sundrie thinges, that may
wel be filed. But I see no cause yet, wherefore M. Hardinge shoulde blowe the
triumphe. For in al this longe rehearsal there is not one woorde spoaken of the
Communion vnder One Kinde. The Breade so changed into a stone, and keapte
for a memorie emonge the Iewels there, was a witnesse of the womans dissimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
and not of M. Hardinges halfe Communion. <hi>Yet</hi> (saith he) <hi>by this storie it is
cleare, the Sacrament was then ministred vnder one Kinde onely. For by receiuinge that one forme,
the woman would haue perswaded her husbande, that she had Communicated with him. Els if
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:12563:81"/>
bothe kindes had then beene ministred, she woulde haue practised some other shifte, for thauoidinge
of the Cuppe, whiche had not beene so easie.</hi> Nowe truely here is but a colde Conclusion,
hanginge wholy (as it may appeare) onely vpon the sleight of a womans witte.
For as this woman had diuised to deceiue her husbande in the Breade, why might
she not as wel diuise to deceiue him in the Cuppe? Why might she not take the
Cuppe, and faine that she dranke, and yet drinke nothinge? Doubtles suche dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation
is sooner wrought in the Cuppe, then in the Breade: and she that durst so
to dissemble in thone parte of Goddes Sacramentes, would little feare to dissemble
in the other.</p>
               <p>Here we sée the certaintie of M. Hardinges gheasses. He reapeth the thinge,
that was neuer sowen: and geathereth of his authours the thinge, that was neuer
spoaken.</p>
               <p>But touchinge the trueth of this whole mater, if a man liste onely to goe by
gheasse, as M. Hardinge doeth, why may he not thus imagine with him selfe, If
this woman would thus dissemble in a case so dangerous, what néeded her to take
the Breade at her maides hande, and specially at that time, in that place, and in the
sight of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole people? Or how coulde she so openly receiue it without suspicion?
Or why might she not haue brought it in a Naptkine secretely aboute her selfe?
The burthen was not greate: her fayninge and hypocrisie had beene the easier.</p>
               <p>And thus muche to answeare one gheasse by an other.</p>
               <p>But that there was no suche dismembringe of the holy Communion at that
time, we may wel vnderstande both by S. Basile,<note place="margin">Chrysost. in. 2. Cor. hom 18.</note> Nazianzene, Gregorie Nyssene,

               <p>The Gospellers, whome M. Hardinge so often vpbraideth with that name, as
if he him self had no parte in Goddes Gospel, haue litle neede to auoide that thing,
whereby they sée them selues nothinge hindred. For the question is moued of the
whole Congregation: answeare is made of seueral personnes. Wee speake of the
order of Churches: M. Hardinge answeareth of forestes and wildernesse. Uerely if
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:12563:82"/>
he coulde finde any thing to purpose in the Churche, he woulde not thus hunte the
Mountaines: neither woulde he flee for ayde into Egipte, if he coulde finde any
neere at home.</p>
               <p>The grounde of this argument is the impossibilitie of keepinge Wine: whiche
M. Hardinge hath hitherto vttered by the name of Forme: Now that it is come to
sowringe, he calleth it wine. There is conninge in shiftinge of termes. But if
there be no Wine there remaininge, as these men woulde perswade the worlde,
what shal we cal it then, that thus standeth in danger of soweringe? Certainely,
Christes bloude wil not sower: and Formes of Wine without substance cannot
sower: either of these bothe can as wel abide the hote countrie, as the colde. But
Gelasius saithe, <hi>There remaineth in the Sacramentes the Nature and Substance of Breade
and Wine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of preseruinge Wines in hoate countries, I wil not reason. Not withstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge,<note place="margin">Macrobius.</note>
I remember, Macrobius saithe, that as the countrie of Egypte is extreme
hoate, so the Wines of the same be extreme colde, and therefore, as it may be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
the more durable. And although the Countrie of Naples be very hoate, yet
the Wines thereof haue béene preserued, the space of fourtie or fiftie yéeres, as it is
mentioned by Plutarche,<note place="margin">Plutarchus in Lu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

But as the Wine is in danger of sowringe, so is the Breade in daunger of
mouldinge, as appeareth by sundrie cautels of the Masse therefore prouided. Yet
one question woulde wel be here demaunded. If the Wine in the Mountaines of
Egypte coulde not be keapte in smal quantities a fewe daies, how then coulde the
wine that Christe changed out of water in Cana of Galilie,<note place="margin">Vinum Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

in Fraunce as a Relique, for the space of fifteene hundred and thirtie yéeres, euer

that wine in the Mountaines coulde not be keapte: yet mought it wel be had and
keapte in Churches, at the least duringe the time of the Communion: and that to
this purpose is sufficient.</p>
               <p>The keepinge of liquoure in a linnen clothe, was M. Hardinges conceite, more
to solace him selfe with al, then muche makinge to the mater. For otherwise as
the wemen receiued the Breade in a clothe, so mighte they receiue the Wine in a
Uial, or some other like thinge. And that they so did, it may wel be geathered by

For firste by that place of S. Cyprian,<note place="margin">Cypria. Sermo. 5. De lapsis.</note> the holy Communion was thought so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie

               <p>The Canon of the Councel of Toledo here alleged, is not an exposition of this
Councel of Carthage, as M. Hardinge thinketh: but a declaration of a Canon made
in the firste Councel of Toledo:<note place="margin">Concil. Toletan. 11. Ca. 11.</note> as it is plaine by these woordes: <hi>In collatione nostri

that, if any man receiued not the Sacrament deliuered to him by the Prieste, the same
shoulde be Excommunicate, as a wicked doer.</hi>
                  </hi> This Decrée séemed very straite, speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
for that a godly man by meane of sickenesse, or other weakenesse of nature,
might happen to refuse, or not to receiue downe the Sacrament, but to caste it vp,
against his wil. Therefore the Councel by way of declaration determineth thus:
that, if any man happen so to doo by force of sickenesse, he shal not stande in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

               <p>Good Christian Reader, now that M. Harding hath said so much, as he is hable, it
behooueth thée, as thou wilt iudge indifferently betwéene vs bothe, so to consider,
and marke wel the very state, and issue of the mater, wherein the whole question
lieth. The negatiue of our side, whiche so muche troubleth him, is this: <hi>That
for the space of sixe hundred yeeres after Christe, it can not be
founde in any old Doctour, or Councel, that euer the holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
vvas ministred to the people in the Church, or any open
assemblie in One Kinde onely, as it is novve ministred in the
Churche of Rome.</hi> The issue therefore of the whole mater betwéene vs,
standeth vpon the order, and vsage of the Churche.</p>
               <p>M. Hardinge for proufe hereof, hath brought certaine particular examples of
Drouthe, Infirmities, Sicknesse, Age, Ineuitable Necessities, &amp; Impossibilities,
and Weakenes of nature. Uerely, good Reader, I lookte for other proufes at M.
Hardinges handes. For al these, &amp; other like thinges I knew before. He hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged

and for further proufe hath brought Coniectures, Gheasses, Lies, and Fables.</p>
               <p>He allegeth abuses, that longe sithence haue beene condemned. He allegeth
Scriptures, Doctours, and Councels, plainely, and directly againste him selfe.</p>
               <p>He is learned, and hath reade muche: he is eloquent, and canne vtter muche:
yea he is hable to make nothinge to appeare somewhat, and a little to séeme much.</p>
               <p>He hath had good conference with as many, as he thought meete, either within
this Realme, or without. He hath seene, what so euer hath beene written by
<hi>Coclaeus, Eckius, Pigghius, Hofmeister, Michael Vaehe, Hosius, Staphylus,</hi>
and suche other of that sorte. He hath had fiue whole yeeres and more, to order,
and digeste his Booke. It toucheth him very neere, that any man shoulde be so
bolde to say, <hi>They haue defrauded the people of halfe the Sacrament, and yet can allege no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge
for it.</hi> He sheweth him selfe muche offended, and therefore spareth not
his familiar termes, <hi>Heretiques, Schismatiques, Aduersaries of the Churche, Goddes Enemies,
and suche like.</hi> Yet hauinge so muche learninge, so muche eloquence, so much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
so muche studie, so muche leasure, beinge so affected, and so offended, yet
hath he not hitherto brought one woorde, either of auncient Councel, or of olde Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour,
to prooue that thinge that is denied: that is, <hi>that the Sacramente vvas
euer Ministred vnto the people in one Kinde, Openly in any
Congregation, or in the open order and vsage of any Churche.</hi>
Yet were there Churches then erected: yet were there Priestes and people then:
yet was the holy Ministration then openly vsed in forme, and order: and learned
men to recorde the same. Al this not withstandinge, M. Hardinge hath hitherto
founde nothinge in the open Ministration, in the Congregation and assemblie of
the people, whereby to prooue his Halfe Communion. Wherfore, there is no cause
yet shewed to the contrary, but M. Iuel may say nowe, as he truly before saide in
his Sermon, <hi>The vvhole Communion vvas vsed throughout the
vvhole Catholique Churche vnder Bothe Kindes, sixe hundred
yeeres after Christes Ascension, in al Congregations, and
Churches vvithout exception.</hi>

what recorde may that appeare? M. Hardinges woorde is no Charter. Or if it
be true, where did the Churche euer so determine of it, within the compasse of sixe
hundred yeeres? S. Augustine in this case is very reasonable:<note place="margin">Ad Casulanum.</note> his woordes be these,

and a Bishop of Rome, saithe, that to Minister the Communion vnder one Kinde, is open Sacrilege.
But where saithe Gelasius so? This is no syncere handlinge of the mater. And bicause he knewe,
the woordes of that Father imported not so muche, guilefully he reciteth them in Latine, and dothe
not Englishe them: whiche he woulde not haue omitted, if they had so plainely made for his purpose.
The woordes of Gelasius be these: <hi>Diuisio vnius e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Of these woordes he cannot conclude, Gelasius to say, that to minister the Communion vnder
one kinde, is open sacrilege. Gelasius rebuketh, and abhorreth the diuision of that highe Mysterie,
whiche vnder one forme, and vnder bothe, is <hi>vnum, idemque,</hi> One, and the same: not one vnder
the forme of Breade, and another vnder the forme of VVine: not one in respecte of the Bodie, and

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:12563:85"/>
of Gelasius. He leaueth the whole route of his owne companie, and is gladde to
renne alone. He expoundeth Gelasius by Leo, as though they wrote bothe of one
thinge. And yet others of his owne side say, that Leo wrote of Heretiques, and
Gelasius of Catholikes: Leo of the people, Gelasius of the Priestes. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth,

He diuiseth newe causes of vnitie of the Mysterie, suche as Gelasius neuer
knewe. He concludeth at the laste, that this breache of Christes Institution, and
Ministration vnder One Kinde, that is nowe vniuersally vsed in the Churche of
Rome, was firste brought in, and practised by the <hi>Manichees,</hi> whiche were in olde

               <p>He saithe, I haue guilefully alleged Gelasius, and to the intent it mighte the

himselfe had meante no guile, he woulde haue shewed plainely, wherein I haue
béene guileful: or what I might haue gotten by this guile: or what aduantage I
mighte haue loste by plainer dealinge. For guile without cause is meere <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But my woordes be these: Gelasius saithe, <hi>that to Minister the Sacrament in one

lieth the guile. How be it therein, as it shal wel appeare, I say nothinge,
but that Gelasius saithe, and M. Hardinge him selfe woulde haue him say. For
thus saithe Gelasius, The diuision of the Mysterie, whereby he meaneth the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
is Sacrilege:<note place="margin">The Prieste mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistringe in One Kinde commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth Sacrilege.</note>

                  </q>
This argument is perfite and formal, &amp; founded vpon Gelasius woordes. I trowe

fourtie yeeres before Gelasius, wente aboute to spreade their Heresie in Rome, and in the partes of
Italy. Their Heretical opinion was, that Christe tooke not our fleashe and Bloude, but that he had
a phantastical bodie, and died not, ne rose againe truely, and in deede, but by way of phantasie.</p>
               <p>And therefore at the Communion, they absteined from the Cuppe: and the better to cloke their Heresie,
came to receiue the Sacrament in the forme of Breade with other Catholike people. Against whome
Leo saithe thus.<note place="margin">Serm. 4. De quadragesima.</note> 
                  <hi>Abdicant enim se Sacramento salutis nostrae &amp;c.</hi> They driue them selues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from the Sacrament of our Saluation. And as they denie that Christe our Lorde was borne in
trueth of our fleashe, so they beleue not that he died, and rose againe truly. And for this cause they
condemne the day of our Saluation, and gladnes (that is the Sonneday) to be their sadde fastinge day.
And where as, to cloke their infidelitie, they dare to be at our mysteries: they temper them selues so in
the Communion of the Sacramentes, as in the meane time they may the more safely keepe them priuie.
VVith vnwoorthie mouthe they receiue Christes Bodie: but to drinke the Bloude of our Redemption,
vtterly they wil none of it. VVhiche thinge we woulde aduertise your holines of, that bothe such men
may be manifested by these tokens vnto you, and also that they whose Diuilishe simulation and fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge
is founde, beinge brought to light, and bewraied of the felowship of Saintes, may be thrust out
of the Churche, by Priestly authoritie. Thus farre be Leo his woordes.</p>
               <p>Gelasius that succeded fourtie yeeres after Leo, imployed no lesse diligence then he did, vtterly to
vanquishe and abolishe, that horrible Heresie. Of whome Platina writeth, that he banished so many
Manichees as were founde at Rome, and there openly burned their bookes. And bicause this heresie
should none els where take roote, and springe, he wrote an Epistle to <hi>Maioricus,</hi> and <hi>Ioannes,</hi> two
Bishoppes, amongst other thinges warninge them of the same. Out of whiche Epistle, this fragment
onely is taken: whereby he dothe bothe briefely shew what the Manichees did for clokinge of their
infidelitie, as Leo saithe: and also in as muche as their opinion was, that Christes Bodie had not very
Bloude, as beinge phantastical onely, and therefore superstitiously absteined from the Cuppe of that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Bloude: geueth charge and commaundement that either forsakinge their Heresie they receiue the
whole Sacramentes, to witte, vnder Bothe Kindes, or that they be keapte from them wholy. Here the
woordes of Leo afore mentioned, and this Canon of Gelasius conferred together, specially the storie of
that time knowen: it may soone appeare to any man of iudgement, against whome this fragment of
Gelasius was written. Verely not against the Church for ministringe the Communion vnder one Kinde,
but against the detestable Manichees, who goeinge aboute to diuide the Mysterie of the Bodie and Bloud
of Christe, denieynge him to haue taken very fleashe and Bloude, so much as in them laye, loosed Christ,
whereof S. Iohn speaketh:<note place="margin">

to auoide the companie of Pigghius, Hosius, Tapper, D. Cole, and al others
his fellowes of that side, and to say that Gelasius wrote this decrée againste the
Manichées: notwithstandinge al they say, he wrote it againste certaine superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Priestes. D. Cole referreth him selfe vnto the construction of the Glose there
written.<note place="margin">De Con. dist. 2. Comperim. In Closa.</note> The woordes thereof be these: <hi>There were certaine Priestes, that consecrated
the Bodie and Bloude of Christe in due order: and receiued the Bodie, but absteined from the
Bloude. Against them Gelasius writeth.</hi> This gheasse of that Gloser, for many good
causes séemeth vnlikely: for first it cannot be shewed by any storie, neither where,

should be remoued from the Sacramentes, not of the Priestes that should remoue
them: of the sacrilege &amp; wickednes of the facte, not of the difference of any persones.</p>
               <p>But the Glose saithe notwithstandinge, <hi>These Priestes Consecrated bothe the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:12563:86"/>
not: That is certaine: for the Glose saithe so. Againe, the people dranke it not:
for so saithe the Glose also: and be it true, or false, it must be defended.</p>
               <p>Then must it needes follow, that Christes Bloud was Consecrate, to be cast
awaye. D. Cole might haue foreséene, that this Glose woulde soone be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him selfe. Now let vs see of this very selfe Glose, what may be concluded of
our side. The Sacrament of Christes Bloud was not throwen away: The Priest
receiued it not. <hi>Ergo,</hi> It followeth of very fine force, it was receiued by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
Thus D. Cole seeking to prooue, that the people receiued not in Both Kindes,
him selfe vnawares necessarily prooueth, that the people receiued in Both Kindes.</p>
               <p>Wherefore M. Hardinges coniecture carrieth more substance of truth. For the
very story, and conference of time, wil soone geue the aduised Reader to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande,
that Gelasius wrote this decrée against the Manichees.</p>
               <p>Thus muche therefore hath M. Hardyng gotten hereby,<note place="margin">Heretiques the first authours of the halfe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</note> that now it appeareth,
that the first authours of his halfe Communion were a sorte of Heretiques. They
helde that Christe neuer receiued Fleshe of the Blessed Uirgin, neither was borne,
nor suffred, nor died, nor arose againe. Which errours are manifestly conuinced by
the Sacramentes. For they are Sacramentes of Christes Body &amp; Bloude: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
who so receiueth the same, confesseth thereby, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Christe of the Uirgin receiued

Symbolum, &amp; signum hoc Sacramentu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> est? <hi>If Christe died not in deede, tel me then, whose
token, or whose signe is this Sacrament?</hi>
                  </hi> Tertullian also by a like argument taken of
the Sacrament reproueth Marcion, that helde that Christe had no Body, but onely
a shew, and a phantasie of a Body. <hi>Christus acceptum Panem, &amp; distributum Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulis,
Corpus suum illum fecit, dicendo, Hoc est Corpus meum, hoc est, figura Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris
mei. Figura autem non esset, nisi veritatis esset Corpus. Caeterum vacua res, quod est
phantasma, figuram capere non potest. <hi>Christe hauinge receiued the Breade, and geuinge
the same to his Disciples, made it his Body, saieing: This is my Body, that is to say, a figure of
my Body. But it coulde not be a figure, onlesse there were a Body of a truth. For a voide thing,
as is a phantasie, can receiue no figure at al.</hi>
                  </hi> Thus the Sacramentes doo plainely testify,
that Christe receiued not a phantasie, or shew of a Body, but a very Body in déede.
Therefore the Manichees absteined from the holy Cuppe, as it appeareth by Leo:
notwithstanding S. Augustine in one place,<note place="margin">Contra Faustum Manich. li. 20. ca. 14.</note> writinge namely against the Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees,
seemeth to signifie the contrary. These be his woordes. <hi>Sacramentum Panis,

               <p>Neither were they in deede hable to shew any simple cause, why they should more
shunne the one portion, then the other. For the Sacrament of the Breade no
lesse consounded their errour, then the Sacrament of the Cuppe. And as they
thought that Christes Body was no Body, but onely a phantasie, so they likewise
thought that Christes Bloud, was no natural Bloud, but onely a phantasie. But
if they woulde not beléeue Leo, or Augustine, that Christe had one Body, how

saith, by the receiuinge the Communion with other Catholike people vnder One Kinde. For whiles
the Catholikes wente from Churche, contented with the onely forme of Breade, it was vncertaine,
whither he that came to receiue were a Manichee, or a Catholike. But after that for discrieinge
of them, it was Decreed, that the people should not forbeare the Communion of the Cuppe any more:
the good Catholike folke so receiued, and the Manichees by their refusal of the Cuppe, bewraied them
selues. Whereby it appeareth that the Communion vnder One Kinde vsed before by the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes

he imagineth Gelasius to geue a law, that no man shoulde diuide that Mysterie,

where are these Decrees? In what Bookes are they written? Or who euer made

<hi>They refuse to drinke the Bloud of our Redemption.</hi>
                  </hi> By these woordes it is cleare, that

               <p>Thou séest, good Christian Reader, that M. Harding notwithstandinge he be

people receiued y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole Communion vnder Bothe Kindes, accordinge to Christes

               <p>The disorder of Praier, that M. Harding hath here taken in hande to defende,
is not onely repugnant to the Scriptures of God, but also contrary to the sense of
Nature. For if Birdes, and Beastes coulde speake, as Democritus the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher
sometime thought, and as <hi>Lactantius</hi> a Christian writer séemeth partly to
say, they doo, yet beinge Birdes, and Beastes, and voide of reason,<note place="margin">Lactantius, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution. li. 3. ca. 10.</note> they woulde
not speake, they know not what. Wherefore séeinge this abuse appeareth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to God, and Nature, and now also is misseliked and condemned by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
iudgement of al People, therfore it behooueth M. Harding to leaue his gheas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and soundely, and effectually to séeke to prooue it.</p>
               <p>Two special thinges he hath confessed in this treatie, whiche quite ouerthrow
his whole purpose: The one is, <hi>That the Praiers in the Primitiue Churche were saide in
the common knowen tongue:</hi> The other is, <hi>That it were good euen now, that the people vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:12563:89"/>
their owne Praiers.</hi> This is the plaine songe, and may wel stande for the
grounde: the rest is altogeather discant, and vaine voluntary, and the moste parte
out of tuene.</p>
               <p>This distinction of Common Praiers, whereof he imagineth some to be made
openly by the Minister of the Churche, some seuerally by euery of the people in
Priuate deuotion, is bothe vnperfit, and also néedelesse. For the secrete praiers,
that the faithful make seuerally by them selues, haue euermore béen called <hi>Priuate,</hi>
and neuer <hi>Common.</hi>

made in suche sorte by the Priest, and in the Churche, may be called Priuate.</p>
               <p>He thinketh, <hi>That the people vttered their Secrete Praiers in the tongue, that they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode,</hi>
and so he saithe, <hi>Christian people doo now for the most parte.</hi> The former parte
hereof is vndoubtedly true. But for the seconde, <hi>That Christian people doo so now,</hi>
Goddes name be blessed, that hath brought it so to passe, not by M. Hardinge, or
his Catholike Doctours, but by suche as they haue withstanded for the same, and
called Heretiques.</p>
               <p>Touchinge the Publique Seruice pronounced by the Priest, wherevnto the people saide, <hi>Amen,</hi>
some <hi>(saithe M. Hardinge)</hi> vnderstoode the language thereof, and some vnderstoode it not.</p>

after the Scriptures had beene reade: whereof it appeareth to Erasmus, that nothing was wonte then
to be reade in the Churches, biside the writinges of the Apostles, or at least of suche men, as were of

vsed as a parte of the Common Seruice: but rather as Homilies, or exhortations to he reade after

                        <hi>Ephrem</hi> wrote sundry thinges in his owne mother tongue:

els<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> here to be geathered, yet hath he touched twoo thinges expressely against him

Scriptures, or other maters of Apostolique authoritie: whiche thinge is also
straitely commaunded by the Councel of Carthage.<note place="margin">Concil. Cartha. 3. Can. 47.</note> Yet M. Hardinge in his
Churche, euen in the Publique Seruice, readeth Lessons, and Legendes of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di

               <p>The other is, that Ephrems Homili<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s were pronounced vnto the people in the

Homilies, and al what so euer, vnto the people in a straunge tongue.</p>
               <p>But to avoide this inconuenience, he saithe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>The Homilies were no parte of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice.</hi>
First how is he sure of that? Certainely, the Latine Homilies be redde
in the Matins, and accompted parte of the Romishe Seruice. Againe, what ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Sequele is this:
<q>
                     <p>The people vnderstoode Ephrems Homilies:

                        <hi>Ergo,</hi> his Homilies were no parte of the Seruice?</p>
                  </q>
Or what leadeth him
to thinke, It was profitable for the people to heare and vnderstande Ephrem, and
yet was not profitablé for them, to heare &amp; vnderstande Peter, Paule, or Christe?
To be shorte, be confesseth, that Ephrems writinges were exhortations to the
Gréeke people: and yet doubteth, whether they were translated into the Gréeke, or
no: and so he endeth in vncertaintie, and concludeth nothing.</p>
               <p>Now let vs sée, whether the same Ephrem wil conclude any thinge of our side.
First, Theodoretus<note place="margin">Theodoret. lib. 4. Ca. 29.</note> saithe, <hi>He was vtterly ignorant of the Greeke tongue.</hi> Whiche

purpose also no doubtes, was very godly. But suche Priuate readinge at home,

The firste proposition, or <hi>Maior,</hi> is confessed as manifest: no learned man wil denie it: and if any
woulde, it may easely be proued. The seconde proposition, or <hi>Minor,</hi> may thus be proued. Strabo, who

Paules peregrination there, who also was borne in the same, in his 14. Booke of Geographie writeth,
that, where as within that <hi>Cherronesus,</hi> that is the streight betweene sea, and sea, there were

               <p>The Scripture it selfe reporteth a diuersitie of language there, and there about, as it appeareth by
the seconde Chapter of the Actes. VVhere the Iewes geathered togeather in Hierusalem, for keepinge

argument, that al Asia the Lesse had not onely the Greeke tongue. And therefore so many of them as
were of other language hauinge the Seruice in Greeke, had it in a tongue they vnderstoode not.</p>
               <p>They that wil seeme to searche the cause, why that lande had so greate diuersitie of languages, impute

that in Asia of sixteene Nations three onely were Greekes, it followeth that the other thirteene
hauinge their seruice in Greeke, had it not in their owne, but in astraunge tongue. For els if they had
al naturally spoaken Greeke, why shoulde not they haue beene called Greekes? Thus we see it is no

Certainely Beda<note place="margin">Beda in Luc. Ca. 22. li. 6. Ex Hieronymo in Matthaeis Ca. 26.</note> séemeth plainely so to say. His woordes be these: <hi>Verely this man

               <p>To this I answeare, <hi>S.</hi> Hierome meaneth that some of al Countries of the Orient or Easte, spake
Greeke, as the Learned menne, Gentle menne, Merchauntes, al of liberal education, and suche other, as
had cause to trauaile those Countries. To be shorte, it was without doubte very common, as beinge
their onely learned tongue for al sciences, and the tongue that might beste serue to trauaile withal
from Countrie to Countrie, within the East, right so as the Latine tongue serueth to the like intentes,
for al Nations of the Weaste. And he meaneth not that al, and singular personnes, of what degree,
and condition so euer they were, al vplandishe people, Tillers of the grounde, Heardmen, and VVomen,
spake Greeke. For if it had beene so, then had they not had peculiar, and proper tongues. For it is not
for their simple heades (for the moste parte) to beare away two languages. In that <hi>S.</hi> Hierome calleth
the Galathians tongue <hi>Propriam linguam,</hi> a proper, and a peculiar tongue to that Nation, he doth
vs to vnderstande, the same to perteine to al in particular, that is, to euery one of that Prouince, and the
Greeke to al in general, in respecte of other Nations there, so as not of necessitie, it be vnderstanded of

that he hath here diuised to shifte of S. Hierome, seemeth very homely, and

Hardinges construction we must take, Al, for Some: or, Al, not for the tenth parte
of Al: and by this Rhetorique, lesse then halfe is as muche as Al: and so, Al, is not
Al. Thus M. Hardinges General is a meere Particular: and to conclude, his

               <p>Wherein M. Hardinge muche abbridgeth the Glorie of the Crosse of Christe,
that woulde the title thereof to perteine onely to the wise, and learned of the
Gréekes. For Albertus, and Lyra say, <hi>It was so written, that al might reade it:</hi> and,
as S. Hierome saithe, <hi>for witnesse of al Nations.</hi> Neither can we finde, that there was
any great number of Philosophers present at Christes death, to reade that title.
As for S. Augustine, by these woordes <hi>Sapientes Graecorum,</hi> he vnderstandeth <hi>Al
the Greekes.</hi> For as al the Iewes generally gloried of the Lawe, euen so al the
Gréekes generally gloried in their wisedome.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.</note> And S. Paule saithe generally
of them bothe. <hi>Iudaei Signum quaerunt: Graeci sapientiam. <hi>The Iewes cal for Signes, and
miracles: and the Greekes cal for knowlege.</hi>
                  </hi> And therefore one of the Philosophers
saide, In olde times there were seuen wise men emonge the Greekes: but nowe
there are not so many fooles: for that they al gloried in their wisedome.</p>
               <p>The people of Lycaonia spake vnto Paule,<note place="margin">Actor. 14.</note> and Barnabas, <hi>Lycaonicè: Ergo,</hi>
saithe M. Hardinge, <hi>they spake no Greeke.</hi> But what if S. Luke had saide, they spake

would he therefore conclude, they sapke no Greeke? Uerely if a man by way of
contention woulde say, the Lycaonical tongue was a corruption, or difference of
the Gréeke tongue, and not a seueral tongue of it selfe, M. Hardinge shoulde haue
muche a doo to prooue the contrary. Doubtlesse, they woorshipped Iuppiter, and
Mercurie, that were the Goddes of the Gréekes: and had the Gréeke Sacrifice, as it
manifestly appeareth by the woordes of S. Luke: and it may be credibly geathered,
that Paule, and Barnabas spake to them in Gréeke. How be it, whether it were
so, or otherwise, sauinge that M. Hardinge maketh the mater so c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But this one thinge, good Reader, I geue the further to consider. These Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caonians,
as M. Hardinge confesseth,<note place="margin">Actor. 14.</note> and as plainely appeareth by S. Luke, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge
yet Infidels, made their praiers vnto their Idolles, Iuppiter, and Mercurie
in their owne tongue. And may it any wise seeme likely, that the same beinge
afterwarde become Christians, made their praiers vnto Almighty God, and to
Christe his Sonne in a straunge tongue? If it behooue Idolaters to vnderstande
their owne praiers, muche more it behooueth the people of God, to doo the like.</p>
               <p>Certainely, if the same Lycaonians were nowe aliue, they would reproue M. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinges

For if the Barbarous Souldiers of their dewtie, and allegeance towardes their
Prince, thought his deathe woorthy to be published in so many tongues: what
maye then be thought of them, that can not suffer the Deathe of Christe to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished

that the Barbarous Nations, whome they had subdued, had greate pleasure in

               <p>Nowe concerninge the Latine tongue, whiche is the learned tongue of the VVeast. That the
Latine Churche, or the VVeast Churche, for so it is called, had the Seruice in Latine, <hi>I</hi> graunte. The
chiefe Regions, and Countries of the Latine Churche, within the foresaide sixe hundred yeeres,
were these. Italie, Aphrike, Illyrike, bothe Pannonies, nowe called Hungarie, and Austria: Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,
nowe Fraunce: and Spaine: The Countries of Germanie, Pole, and Swethen, and those Northe
partes receiued the faithe longe sithence. The Countries of Britaine here had receiued the Faithe
in moste places, but were driuen from the open profession of it againe, by the cruel persecution of
Diocletian the Emperour: at whiche persecution, <hi>S.</hi> Albane with many others suffered Martyrdome.</p>
               <p>After that these Countries had beene instructed in the Faithe, as thinges grewe to perfection,
they had their Seruice accordingely: no doubte suche as was vsed in the Churches, from whence

in this case maketh smal proufe. His proufe for the Latine Seruice,<note place="margin">The faith came not first from Rome.</note> hangeth
vpon twoo pointes. The first is, that al the faithe of the Weast parte of the world,
came onely from the Bishoppes of Rome: The seconde is, that the planters of the

And somewhat to touche hereof by the way, S. Paule saith, <hi>that he him selfe had
filled al places with the Gospel of Christe, euen as farre as Illyricum:</hi> and that not from
Rome, but from Hierusalem: and promiseth, that he woulde passe by Rome into
Spaine, as, by reporte of some, afterwarde he did: and Theodoretus saithe, that

The like is commonly surmised by the writers of the Brittishe Chronicles,
of Ioseph of Arimathaea. And, although Coniectures in suche Antiquities be often
vncertaine and darke, yet it may séeme very likely, that the Religion of Christe
came first into this Ilelande, not from Rome, but from the Greekes: both for that
in the kéepinge of Easter day we folowed the Churche of <hi>Graecia,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Beda in Histo. Anglo. li. 2. Galfrid. li. 8. Ca. 4.</note> &amp; not the Church

woulde in no wise acknowlege, or receiue the Bishop of Rome. As for Lazarus,

               <p>First he saithe, S. Augustines woordes be otherwise, then I reporte them. I
assure thée, good Reader, if this great errour had béene woorthe the shewinge, it had
neuer béene suffred thus to passe in silence.</p>
               <p>But to shifte of S. Augustines woordes, here is brought in a Glose plaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the texte. <hi>For this comparison,</hi> saithe M. Hardinge, <hi>betweene Menne, and Birdes,
muste be taken, not of the woordes, but of the sense and vnderstandinge.</hi> And what reason lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
him thus to say: Uerily Birdes are vtterly voide of reason, and neither vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande
the woordes, they be taught to speake, nor the meaninge of the woordes.
And yet muste we onely vpon this simple warrante, needes beleeue, that S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine
compareth Birdes with Menne in vnderstandinge?</p>
               <p>S. Augustines meaninge is plaine, as is the meaninge of other godly Fathers
in this behalfe, <hi>that the people shoulde know, what they praie, and so singe with reason a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to a Man, and not chatter with voice, as Birdes doo. For if they Singe, or Pray, they
knowe not what, he saithe, that for their sounde of voyce, and wante of sense, they may be wel
compared with Owselles, or Popiniayes.</hi> This is the very drifte of S. Augustines
meaninge. Birdes by skil may be trained to recorde, and sounde Mens woordes, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they haue no vnderstandinge of them: As Plinius writeth of the Rauen,
that was taught to say, <hi>Aue Caesar Imperator,</hi> Alhaile Emperour Caesar: an other
that had learned to saye, <hi>Salue victor Antoni:</hi> Alhaile Antonius the Conquerour.
and Caelius Rhodiginus writeth that Cardinal Ascanius had a Popiniaye,<note place="margin">Caelius Rhodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin. li. 3. Ca. 32.</note> that
coulde pronounce distinctly al the articles of the Creede. With suche Birdes let vs
compare suche Men, as pray, they know not what. <hi>They be taught to sounde woordes,
but vnderstande not the meaninge of them: neither Singe they with reason agreeable to a Man.</hi>
Whether these woordes agrée aptely to my purpose, or no, let M. Harding himselfe
be the Iudge. Certainely, he shal haue muche to doo, to racke them to serue for his
purpose: Onlesse perhaps he wil reason thus, <hi>S. Augustine exhorteth Men to knowe
what they praie: <hi>Ergo,</hi> they may praie in an vnknowen tongue.</hi> Or thus, S. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine
willeth Men, not to Singe, or chatter like Birdes: <hi>Ergo,</hi> they may praye, they knowe
not what.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if we receiue M. Hardinges Glose of <hi>Sense and vnderstandinge,</hi> yet stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
he in case, as he did before. For if the people vnderstande not the woordes,
muche lesse can they vnderstande the sense, and meaninge of the same woordes.</p>
               <p>Aristotle saithe, Hearinge is the peculiar sense of learninge: and therefore they

this shifte healpeth nothinge. Onles he thinke this is a good argument: <hi>The people

                  </hi> I wil heare them, yea before they crie.</p>

Priest lifte vp his voice, and pray alowde, in the open assemblie in the Churche? <hi>He answea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,</hi>
Not that God, but that men may heare him: that the people by the sounde of his voice,
and vnderstandinge his meaning, may be put in minde, and by consente be ioyned togeather,
and be lifted vp to God. <hi>This is the very meaninge and minde of S. Augustine, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gréeinge
fully with these woordes of S. Cyprian:</hi> The Priest before Praier prepareth
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:12563:99"/>

of voice,<note place="margin">Cyprian. de O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratione Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica.</note> but the minde and vnderstandinge must pray vnto the Lorde with pure intention.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Al this</hi> (saithe M. Hardinge) <hi>perteineth to the sense, and vnderstandinge of the Praier, and
nothinge to the Vulgare tongue.</hi> And doothe he thinke, the people can vnderstande the
praier, without vnderstandinge of the tongue? S. Augustine, if he were aliue,
woulde be ashamed to sée suche a Comment vpon his woordes. He saithe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>The Priest lifteth vp his voice, not that the people may vnderstande him, but onely for a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
to shew that he praieth.</hi> And thus he maketh the Minister of God, woorse then

the Priest,<note place="margin">Augustin. de Magistro.</note> be plaine in it selfe, yet afterwarde in the same Booke, he openeth it

That is to say, <hi>To offer vp other praiers also with lowde voice:</hi> Neither
did I avouche any vntruth by Iustinian: as M. Hardinge hath here d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Now, for so muche as M. Hardinge taketh occasion, for that I past this place
of Iustinian so shortely ouer, onely touchinge it with one woorde, as the time then
forced mée, I thinke it not amisse for the better contentation of the Reader, to lay
it out fully, as it lieth. His woordes be these:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Authen. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitut. 123.</note> Wee commaunde al Bishops, and Priestes,
to minister the Holy Oblation, and the praier at the Holy Baptisme, not vnder silence, but
with suche voice, as may be hearde of the faithful people: to the intente, that thereof the
heartes of the hearers may be sturred to more deuotion, and honour geuinge to God the Lorde.
For so the holy Apostle teacheth,<note place="margin">1. Corin. 14.</note> sayeinge in the firste Epistle to the Corinthians: <hi>For if
thou only blisse vvith the spirite, hovv shal he, that supplieth the roume of the
ignorant, saye</hi> Amen,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>(to God) at thy thankes geuinge? For he knovveth not
vvhat thou saiest. Thou geuest thankes vvel, but the other is not edified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For these causes therefore it behooueth, that the praier at the holy Oblation, and also other
praiers, be offred with lowde voice of the holy Bishoppes, and Priestes vnto our Lorde Iesus
Christe with the Father, and the Holy Ghost. And let the holy Priestes vnderstande, that,
if they neglecte any of these thinges, they shal make answeare therefore at the dreadful iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the greate God, and our Sauiour Iesus Christe. And yet neuerthelesse, wee vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge
the same, wil not passe it ouer, nor leaue it vnpunisshed.</p>
               <p>Here wée sée, it is lawful for a godly Prince, to commaunde Bishoppes and
Priestes: To make lawes, and orders for the Churche: To redresse the abuses of
the Sacramentes: To allege the Scriptures: To threaten and punishe Bishops
and Priestes, if they offende.</p>
               <p>Now, if these woordes of Iustinian make not for vs, and that without Foi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinge
or Cogginge, muche lesse make they for M. Hardinge: onlesse he wil forme
his reasons thus:
<q>
                     <p>The Priest must speake a lowde, <hi>Ergo,</hi> He may speake in an vnknowen tongue.
<lb/>
                        <hi>Or thus:</hi> The people must heare the Praier, and answeare, <hi>Amen:</hi>
                        <lb/>
                        <hi>Ergo,</hi> They neede not to vnderstande it.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>To be shorte, where as, to the intente to bringe Goddes truthe out of credite,
and to make it odious emonge the ignorant, he saith, <hi>Wee haue refused to be the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Churche of God.</hi> This is onely a bitternesse of talke inflamed with malice,
whereof it seemeth he wanted no stoare, and neither furthereth his cause emonge
the wise, nor hindreth ours. If wée be no members of the Churche, that wishe
al the people euery where to vnderstande, what they Praie, to ioyne their hartes
togeather, and to be lifted vp vnto God: what then be they, that wishe al the
Churche to be drowned in ignorance, and the people to know nothinge? If S.
Paule were now aliue, he woulde answeare him, as sometime he answeared Ely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas.

that the whole people of Aphrica, in al the Mountaines, and vplandishe

S. Augustine, S. Hierome, and others, in infinite places, that the people of that
Countrie had a natural tongue of their owne, distincte from al others, and seueral
onely to them selfe. And therfore to prooue the same in suche earnest sorte, by

<hi>Mammon,</hi> and <hi>Iar,</hi> and other like woordes, and certaine prouerbes, vsed in the

S. Augustine, but an other of the same name, as farre vnlike him in learninge,

But it is thought of many, that he corrupted the Religion, that he founde

whether he be disdaineful, and proude or no? Prouide ye, saithe this holy man, that he may be

               <p>M. Hardinge shoulde not thus mocke the worlde. He knoweth wel, a Childe
woulde not make suche reasons. For Augustine was no Parishe Prieste, ne ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
no Cure, but onely had a place seuerally appointed to him selfe. Neither did
any Englishe man resorte to his Seruice, onlesse it were to sée the strangenesse of
his dooinges. He might as wel reason thus:
<q>
                     <p>The Iewes this day in Venice haue their Seruice in the Hebrewe tongue:
<lb/>
                        <hi>Ergo,</hi> the people of Italy haue their Seruice in the Hebrewe.</p>

choose out, and geather togeather, and commende the same to the Church of Englande, there to be leafte

be in Englishe, or if it had beene tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>slated into the Englishe tongue, it is not to be thought, that Bede,
who declareth al thinges concerninge maters of Religion so diligently, specially professing to write
an Ecclesiastical storie, woulde haue passed ouer that in silence. And if the Masse had beene vsed in
the Englishe tongue, the Monumentes, and Bookes so muche multiplied amonge the Churches, woulde

               <p>This is an other <hi>Syllogismus</hi> of M. Hardinges. God wote he might haue made it
better. Of S. Gregories woordes he might rather haue concluded thus:
<q>
                     <p>The people of Englande in their praiers pronounced the Hebrewe Halleluia:
<lb/>
                        <hi>Ergo,</hi> they had the Hebrewe Seruice:</p>
                  </q>
Whiche doubtelesse in the Englishe Churches had beene very strange: and yet as
muche reason in that, as in the Latine. As for these Hebrewe woordes, <hi>Halleluia,
Amen, Sabbaoth,</hi> and other like, they may as wel be vsed in the Englishe Seruice,
as in the Latine: and at this daie are vsed, and continued stil in the reformed
Churches in Germanie: and therefore can importe no more the one, then the other.</p>

The force of his reason séemeth to weigh thus,
<q>These Musicians taught the Clerkes of Englande, to singe their Seruice after the

saithe, that is by inspiration, or promtinge of the Spirite, so, as neither others, that were present,
neither him selfe, after the opinion of Chrysostome, vnderstoode, what he saide. That gifte the Apostle
did not forbidde. For that euery gifte of God is good, and nothinge by him done in vaine: but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted
the Corinthians from the vaine, and ambitiouse vse of it: and therefore did muche extenuate
the same, and preferred propheciynge, that is, the gifte to interprete and expounde Scriptures, farre

Nowe, if in these daies the manner were like, if it pleased the Holie Ghoste to powre vpon vs the like
abundance of grace, as to doo al thinges for vs, to rule the heades of al faithful people, to carrie eche
one of vs with his diuine inspiration, and when we came to Church togeather for comforte, and edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieing,
to geue into our hartes, and put into our mouthes by daily miracle, vvhat vvee should pray, and

giftes, and right wel may wee doo without them. For the speakinge with tongues, was insteede
of a signe, or wonder, not to them that beleued, but to the vnbeleuers. And signes be for the vnfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful:
the faithful haue no neede of them. In Churches, I meane where auncient order is kepte, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
the Seruice is songe, or saide, the ministers doo not speake with tongues, or with a tongue, in suche

might not be edified. The Latine Seruice is not so done in the Churche, as the exposition of the
Scriptures be thereby excluded. In the Apostles time they came to Churche, to thintent they might
profitably exercise the giftes, God gaue them, and by the same, specially by the gifte of prophecieinge,
edifie one an other, and teache one an other. Nowe a daies, they come not togeather to Churche, one
to teache an other, and to expounde the Scriptures in common: but to praye, and to heare the opening

                  </hi> The reason thereof is

                  <note place="margin">Chrysost. in. 1. Cor. hom. 35.</note> Chrysostome saithe, S. Paule driueth the whole tenoure of this mater,

                  </hi> And againe the same Chrysostome saithe farther: <hi>Sic &amp; vos, nisi signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficantem

noyse of strange vvordes, vvherewith you descant vpon the vvorde, Spirite, so violently applied by your

that by way of Metaphore, any manner of vtterance whereby the signes of thinges are pronounced,
before they be vnderstanded. And by the Sprite, he vnderstandeth not a noyce of strange wordes,
after your strange interpretation, but as it is here in a certaine proper and peculiar manner taken, a

them not. And thinges so vttered, be vttered with the tongue, and spirite, whether it be

nothinge for our purpose, let vs a litle examine one, or two, of M. Hardinges rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
&amp; sée, howe wel he applieth the same to his purpose. The first is this: <hi>S. <hi>Paule
intreateth of the miraculous gifte of Tongues:</hi> Ergo, <hi>His woordes make nothinge againste the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
Seruice.</hi>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, <hi>S. <hi>Paule willeth, that the priest vtter the Common Praiers in the Congregation, in such
Language, as the vnlearned may be edified thereby, and answeare,</hi> Amen: Ergo,</hi> (M. Harding
seemeth to say) <hi>The Priest may vtter the Common Praiers in an vnknowen tongue.</hi> Surely these
argumentes would make a strange noice in the Schooles, and set al Logique quite
out of tune. But, if S. Paules woordes make nothing against the Latine Seruice,
as it is now vsed, what is it then that S. Paule condemneth? Why concludeth he
thus, <hi>How shal the ignorant say, <hi>Amen,</hi> at thy thankes geuing? For he knoweth not, what
thou saiest.</hi> Why, setteth he the whole difference in Knowinge, and not Knowing?
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:12563:114"/>
Or what misseliketh he els,<note place="margin">The lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Latin Tongue.</note> 
                  <hi>but the sounde, or noise of a strange tongue,</hi> whereby he

thus: <hi>Praie thou in a strange vnknowen tongue: that the people may say, <hi>Amen.</hi> For so
may they say, although they knowe not what thou praiest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The allegation of <hi>the learned Latine tongue,</hi> whiche M. Harding so often vseth,
may serue rather to astonne the simple, then to make any good sufficient proufe.

               <p>No tongue is to be accompted learned in it selfe, but onely in respecte of some

bisides that it is not eloquent in it selfe (as in déede it néedeth not to be) sometimes
it holdeth not good congruitie, but is vtterly voide of reason. Wherein, let this
one example stande for many. In the praises of the Blessed Uirgin, it is written

shew, no doubte, to gase, and to woonder at. But alas, nothinge haue they there
either to receiue, or to taste of: either to mooue them to repentance, or to comforte,

thus: <hi>Cicero saith, Tongues be in number infinite. Of them al, Neither <hi>M.</hi> Iuel, nor any one of
his side, is hable to shew, that the publique Seruice of the Churche in any Nation, was euer for the

contrarywise, either of forgeatfulnesse what he hath saide before, or of some other

                  <hi>Verily, in the Primitiue Churche this was necessary, when the

the people, for cause of their further instruction.</hi> By these woordes, he vtterly ouerthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth,
that he so confidently saide before: and very wel confirmeth my assertion.
M. Iuel may now take his ease. For M. Hardinge him selfe is hable to prooue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him selfe, that in the Primitiue Churche the Seruice was ministred in the
Common tongue: and that he confirmeth for a veritie, and saith, <hi>It was necessary so

better novv for expedition, the Seruice be saide in a strange Language, and that onely the Clerke
make answeare to the priest, in steede of the vvhole Congregation.</p>
               <p>Thus saith M. Hardinge, not by the authoritie of S. Ambrose, S. Augustine,
S. Hierome, S. Chrysostome, or any other like olde Catholique Doctour, but onely
by warrant of late Doctours, Thomas of Aquine, and Nicolas Lyra: the former
of whiche twoo, liued at the least twelue hundred yéeres after Christe. His reason
in shorte is thus: <hi>The people novv is instructed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

and answeared him in their owne tongue: and praied with him al togeather. Or
did Chrysostome euer checke the people for their knowlege, or discourage them
from reading the Scriptures? Certainly he oftentimes rebuketh them for not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge,
and willeth them to bye the Scriptures:<note place="margin">Chrysost. in Mat. hom. 2.</note> to reade the Scriptures: and to

                  </hi> This was Origens whole, and onely purpose. He exhorteth not the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

that there was any such Seruice in the whole Churche of God, either then in Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gens

people to reade the Scriptures, yea although they were not hable to reatche the

               <p>The errour or fraude hereof may the better appeare by that, I haue before decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
It is called <hi>Fallacia ab Amphibologia,</hi> that is, of the doubteful takinge of
one woorde. For this woorde <hi>(Vnderstandinge)</hi> hath twoo significations. For we
vnderstande the woordes, &amp; we vnderstande the meaninge of the woordes. Origen
saithe, <hi>the people vnderstoode not the meaninge of the Scriptures: <hi>Ergo,</hi>

at al.</hi> And therein standeth the falseheade of his argument. And againe, The
woordes that Origen writeth of Readinge the Scriptures, M. Hardinge applieth
the same to the Common Seruice: and so violently, and perforce altereth, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praueth
Origens meaninge, and concludeth one thinge for an other. And thus this
good Father is drawen in to prooue that thinge, that he neuer neither knewe, nor

<hi>This exposition of Chrysostome is very strange, and agreeth with fewe others:
and yet is the same here by M. Hardinge vntruely reported. For Chrysostome

But if there be so many keyes bounde togeather, what if M. Hardinge haue missed
in his choise, and haue taken one keye for an other?</p>
               <p>His reason standeth thus, <hi>The simple people vnderstandeth not the deepe meaninge of
the Psalmes: <hi>Ergo,</hi> they vnderstande nothinge in the Psalmes.</hi> By this keye M. Hardinge
may happen to shutte out him selfe. This is a false kinde of reasoninge, whiche in
the Schooles is called <hi>A secundum quid, ad simpliciter.</hi> For albeit the people vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande
not al the highe Mysteries of the Scriptures, yet it foloweth not, that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they vnderstande nothinge in the Scriptures. For in the Scriptures there
is bothe Stronge meate for Menne, and also Milke for Children: <hi>And in the same,</hi>

that the vnderstandinge of the Common Seruice was euer thought the cause of

               <p>Now, good Christian Reader, for the better contenting of thy minde, I beséeche
thée to looke backe, and to consider the whole substance of al, that M. Hardinge
hath laide in for proufe of this Article, what weight it beareth, and how wel it ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
to his purpose. He hath intreated largely of singinge in the Quier, at what
time, and where it first beganne: and likewise hath prooued by a greate longe dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of situation of countries, and diuersitie of tongues, that neither al the east
parte of the worlde vnderstoode the Gréeke, nor al the people of Aphrica, Mauri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tania,
Spaine, and Fraunce vnderstoode the Latine: whiche labour in this case
was nothinge needeful. But that al the Nations of the East parte had their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
in the Greeke tongue, and that al the people of Aphrica, Mauritania, Spaine,
and Fraunce had their Seruice in the Latine tongue, whiche thinge onely stoode
in Question, and therefore was onely to be prooued, he hath hitherto vtterly leaft
vnprooued. Touchinge the Publique Seruice within this Ilelande, the storie of
Augustine of Rome, and Edda, and Putta, and other Poetes, and singinge men,
as I haue shewed, standeth him in smal stéede. Contrary to his owne knowlege
he saith, that the fouretéenth Chapter of S. Paule to the Corinthians cannot ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
be applied to this purpose: And further he saith, that euen from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
time, the Priest euermore made his Praiers in the Quier, farre of from the
hearinge of the people: That the ignorant people vnderstandeth the Latine
Tongue, although not in most exacte wise, or perfitely: That they are now better
instructed in the Articles of the Faith, then they were in the time of the Apostles:
That it is sufficient for them now to be taught by Gestures, and Ceremonies: and
that they haue greate profit by hearinge their Seruice, although they know not
what they heare. Againe he saith, that the Gréeke, and Latine be learned ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues,
and therefore al the Seruice of the Churche throughout the whole worlde,
ought to be ministred in one of them: That al the Psalmes, and al other Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
are harde, and farre passe the capacitie of the people: That vnderstandinge of
the mater causeth the minde to wander: and to be shorte, that praier in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
tongue, that euermore bredde Schismes, and Diuisions in the Churche.</p>
               <p>He hath openly falsified Strabo, Iustinian, Origen, Chrysostome, and others,
and hath forced them to say the thinge, they neuer meante.</p>
               <p>This is the whole Summarie of al that he had to say. Hereof he woulde séeme
to conclude, that within the first sixe hundred yeeres after Christe, the Common
Seruice was ministred openly in a tongue vnknowen vnto the people: Albeit he
hath hitherto alleged neitheir Scripture, nor Councel, nor Decrée, nor Doctour,
nor Example, or Practise of the Primitiue Churche to prooue the same.</p>
               <p>Of the other side,<note place="margin">Iustinian. Lyra. &amp; Thom.</note> it is sufficiently prooued of our parte, that the fouretienth
Chapter to the Corinthians must of necessitie belonge to the vse of Common
praiers: and that in the Primitiue Churche, the Seruice was euery where Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred
in the Uulgare Tongue, and that the Priest and the people praied al togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
I haue prooued, not onely that the Nations, that vnderstoode Greeke, or
Latine, had their Seruice in the Greeke, or Latine tongue, but by Theodoretus,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:12563:124"/>

people had their Seruice in their seueral Barbarous tongues: by Sulpitius, that
the people of France, then called Gallia, had their Seruice in the Frenche tongue.
S. Hierome saithe, <hi>Vox quidem dissona, sed vna Religio. Tot penè psallentium chori,

shorte, I haue prooued by S. Chrysostome, and by Lyra, and others, that there can
no manner profit redounde vnto the people, of praiers made in a strange tongue.</p>
               <p>Séeinge therefore M. Hardinges Doctrine standeth vpon so simple groundes,
as I haue shewed, and serueth onely to mainteine ignorance, and the kingedome
of darkenesse, it is now thy parte, gentle Reader, to iudge indifferently betwéene
vs, bothe how iustly he hath coloured the same with suche a face of antiquitie, and
also how truely, and substantially he hath answeared my assertion.</p>

               <p>First, as concerning the right of the Primacie by Goddes lawe, by these auncient authorities it

bicause to him Bishoprike was first geuen in the Churche of Christe, where as our Lorde saide
vnto him, <hi>Thou arte Peter, and vpon this Rocke I vvil builde my Churche, and the gates
of Hel shal not preuaile against it: and vnto thee I vvil geue the keyes of the kingedome
of Heauen.</hi> VVherefore this Peter receiued of our Lorde first of al, power to binde and to loose:
and first of al he brought people to the faithe by vertue of his Preachinge. As for the other Apostles,
they receiued honour and power in like felowship with him, and willed him to be their Prince, or
chiefe gouernour.</p>
               <p>In an other Epistle to al Bishops, alleging the same texte, for the Primacie of the see of Rome,
speakinge of the disposition of Churches committed to Patriarkes, and Primates, saith thus moste
plainely. This holy and Apostolike Churche of Rome, hath obteined the Primacie, not of the Apostles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but of our Lorde and Sauiour him selfe, and hath gotten the preeminence of power ouer al Churches,

that it should be lawful for any prieste to appeale from his owne ordinarie, or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitane,

Aphrica answeared,<note place="margin">Concil. Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginen. 6. Ca. 3.</note> there was no law it shoulde be so. Faustinus laide foorth this
Canon of the Councel of Nice, not made by the authoritie of the Bishops there, but
onely diuised by the Bishop of Rome. The Bishops there, emonge whome was S.

of the Councel of Nice, haue committed both the inferior Clerkes, and also the Bishopes,
vnto their Metropolitanes. For it was discreetely, and rightly considered, that al maters are
to be determined, in the places where they began: and that no Prouince canne lacke the Holy
Goste, whereby the Bishoppes of Christe may be hable, bothe wisely to see, and also constante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

the discretio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his Iudges, to appeale either to a Particular Councel within the same Realme,

God is hable to inspire the trial of Iustice into one man alone,

a great number of Bishoppes meetinge togeather in Councel.
<hi>And howe may suche beyondesea Iudgement be thought good, whereunto the personnes of
the witnesses, which in trial of trueth are thought necessary, either for that thei be wemen, or
for the infirmitie of their age, or for many other incident lettes, cannot be brought? Now that
any should be sente abroade, as it were from your holmes side, we finde it not decreed in any

the Councel.</p>
               <p>The Bishop of Rome, when he sawe he was taken with the manner, and found
an open falsarie, for that the Canons of his makinge disagreed from the very Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginalles,
thought it good policie, to saye, the Originalles were burnte by the Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
and so no true copie nowe remaininge, but his onely. And therefore he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:12563:133"/>
a letter to be written in the name of Athanasius, and other Bishops of Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypte,
vnto Marcus the Bishop of Rome, wherein they besought him a copie of
the Nicene Councel, for that al their Bookes were vtterly destroyed. But this
shifte was to simple. For it were harde for M. Hardinge to shewe, what helpe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanasius
coulde haue founde in any of those Canons, that are nowe presumed to
be burnte, wherewith either to relieue him selfe in that case, or els to molest and
greeue his aduersaries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But, bothe Iulius the Bishop of Rome, and also Athanasius the Bishop of Alexandria make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

of any vntruethe.</hi> This remouinge of suspition, I know not howe, séemeth som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what

to be salued?<note place="margin">In Epistola De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretali Iulij.</note> In deede, Iulius allegeth a Canon of the Councel of Nice: But M.
Hardinges Canon he allegeth not. And the compiler of the Councelles, gaue this
note in the Margine touchinge the same. <hi>Hoc Statutum solùm reducibile est ad quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,
&amp; sextum Caput Niceni Concilij: Verùm apertè non inuenitur. <hi>This Decree maye

                  </hi> Suche credite is to be geuen to this Iulius in his allegations.</p>
               <p>As for M. Hardinges Athanasius,<note place="margin">Manifeste for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerie</note> his tale is so simple, that it wil soone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray
it selfe.<note place="margin">Athanasius in Epist. ad Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxos. Socrates li. 2. cap. 14.</note> For, as I noted before, he writeth vnto Marcus the Bishop of Rome,
of the burninge of the Bookes: and yet Athanasius him selfe certainely knewe,
that Marcus was deade, at the least nine yéeres before that burninge happened.</p>
               <p>Euen so, the vaine forger of the Emperour Constantines greate Dotation,
imagineth him to Decrée, that the Bishop of Constantinople shoulde be subiecte
vnto the See of Rome. And yet neither was the Citie of Constantinople at that
time builte, nor any suche name yet knowen in the worlde, nor any Bishoprike
there erected. A man might saye, <hi>Non satis commodè diuisa sunt temporibus ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi
Daue haec.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe the same Athanasius writinge vnto Foelix,<note place="margin">Athanasius in Epistola ad Foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licem. Athanasius in Epistola ad Marcum.</note> saithe, <hi>The Arianes
had falsified the Nicene Councel:</hi> but writinge vnto Marcus of the same

had burnte the Councel of Nice.</hi> But if it were burnte, howe was it fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sified?
If it were falsified, how was it burnte? These tales hange not wel together.
But, for as much as M. Harding woulde so faine haue the Pope to holde by burnte
euidence, if it may please thée (gentle Reader) discretely to weigh the whole cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance
of the mater, thou shalte soone finde, that al this great adoo was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge
els but a greate fable.<note place="margin">Theodoret. li. 1. cap. 9. &amp; li. 2. cap. 8.</note> For firste it appéereth by Theodoretus, that the
whole Actes,<note place="margin">Marius Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin. aduersus A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium. li. 2.</note> and Copies of the Councel of Nice, were sente abroade vnto al Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
that were awaye. And Marius Uictorinus writinge against Arius, saith,
that the same Actes were sente abroade into the whole worlde, &amp; that many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sande
Bishops subscribed and agréed vnto them. Whiche thing being vndoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
true, it were very muche for M. Hardinge to saye, that al these copies, in al par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
of the worlde, coulde be destroyed vpon the suddayne: and that altogeather in
one place, and with one fyer, and at one commaundement. The Arianes neither
were so mightie to atchieue it: nor so foolishe to attempte it. Cetainely, the like
neuer happened to any other Councel. But what néedeth woordes, where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mater is
plaine?<note place="margin">Concil. Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginen. 6. cap. 4.</note> The Bishoppes of Aphrica had the very copies of these Canons. Alypius
the Bishop of Tagasta, in this conference with Faustinus, saide, <hi>Adhuc tamen

nescio qua ratione, minimè inuenimus. <hi>But this one thinge muche moueth me, that confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe,

of the See of Rome, that is alleged) I know not how, we founde not there.</hi>
                  </hi> And Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillus
the Bishop of Alexandria, beinge desired for trial of this mater, to sende the

                  <hi>I thought it needeful to sende

                  <note place="margin">Concil. Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginen. 6. ca. 103.</note> Likewise Atticus y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Bishop
of Constantinople to the same request answeareth thus, <hi>Canones sicut statuti sunt in
Nicaea Ciuitate à Patribus in integro ad vos direxi. <hi>I haue sente vnto you the Canons in the
whole, euen as they were made, and ratified by the Fathers in the Citie of Nice.</hi>
                  </hi> Nowe if
these Canons were quite burnte, as M. Hardinge saith, how were they afterwarde
founde whole, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> godly Father Atticus, and the learned Bishop Cyrillus saithe?
And if they were afterwarde founde whole, how then were they quite burnte be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore?
Or howe is it, that no man, neither in Aphrica, nor in Europa, nor in Asia:
neither in the East Churche, nor in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Weast, was euer hable to sée these Canons,
but onely the Bishop of Rome, that so ambitiously claimeth by them? And if he
haue them in déede, and that of suche authentique recorde, vnder the handes of the
thrée hundred and eightéene Bishops, as it is boldely auouched, why are they not
shewed? Why haue they béene for the space of these thertéene hundred yeeres still
kepte inuisible? Uerily the Councel of Nice were wel woorthe the shewinge.</p>
               <p>Al these thinges rightly weighed, may seeme sufficient to discrie a Forger. Yet
(gentle Reader) the better to satisfie thy minde, marke how earnestly, &amp; with what
cunninge M. Hardinges Athanasius forceth on his fable. He thought it not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to say, <hi>The Canons al were quite burnte,</hi> whiche thinge he onely saith, and no man
els, but bicause he sawe, Wise men woulde replie, <hi>There vvere no suche Canons e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
made,</hi> therefore he tooke paines further to shew the considerations, and causes,
and the whole order, and circumstance of the making, whereat, he saith, he him selfe
was present.<note place="margin">Athanas. in Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sto. ad Marcum.</note> 
                  <hi>Fourscore Canons,</hi> he saith, <hi>were diuised in the whole: whereof fourtie were
laide in in Latine by the Latines: and fourtie other in Greeke by the Grecians. Of this whole
number of Canons,</hi> saith he, <hi>the Fathers there tooke of tenne Canons, and diuided them as they
might, moste handesomely emonge the rest, and so made vp onely the number of threescore and
tenne Canons: therby mystically to represent the threescore and tenne Disciples: or els the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the threscore and tenne Tongues, that be knowen in the worlde.</hi> Thus of wholesome
and Godly rules of Faith, and manners, M. Hardinges Athanasius hath leasure to
fansie preatie Mysteries.</p>
               <p>But, for better viewe hereof, I remember, Cardinal Cusanus touchinge the
Famous Donation of Constantine,<note place="margin">Nicolaus Cusa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nus De Donati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one Constantini.</note> writeth thus: <hi>In ipsa scriptura reperi manifesta
argumenta falsitatis: <hi>Euen in the writinge of it, I haue founde manifest tokens of falsehoode.</hi>
                  </hi>
The like maye be saide of these M. Hardinges newe Canons: <hi>Euen in the vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance,
and vvritinge of them, vve may finde plaine contrarietie, and therefore vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
tokens of vntruthe.</hi> For the former twentie Canons, whereof there is
no question, were made in the Councel of Nice: But the rest, whereof S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine,
and the Bishops of Aphrica moued doubte, &amp; whereby the Bishop of Rome
woulde seeme to claime, were diuised at Rome, and not at Nice. This newe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
here alleged saithe, <hi>The Bishop of Rome hath the rule, and soueraintie ouer al Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arkes:</hi>
But the very true, and vndoubted Councel of Nice saithe farre otherwise:
<hi>Antiqua consuetudo seruetur per Aegyptum, Lybiam, &amp; Pentapolim: vt Alexandrinus
Episcopus horum omnium habeat potestatem:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Concil. Nicen. can. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>quia &amp; vrbis Romae Episcopo parilis mos

Bishop of Alexandria haue the gouernement ouer al these. For the Bishop of the Citie of
Rome hathe the like order.</hi>
                  </hi> But this Canon the Bishoppe of Rome hath no
soueraintie ouer other Patriarkes, as M. Hardinge fantasieth, but onely a
felowshippe, and equalitie with the reste, to walke carefully within his
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:12563:134"/>
owne diuision,<note place="margin">Parilis mos.</note> as others were bounde to doo within theirs. And in this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
these twoo woordes, <hi>Parilis mos,</hi> are specially to be noted: whiche cannot other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
be expounded, but onely of like manner, order, and authoritie of Iurisdiction.
M. Hardinges Canon saithe, <hi>S. Peter was Maister, and ruler ouer al Christen Princes:</hi>
and yet is not M. Hardinge hable to prooue, that while S. Peter liued, there was
any one Prince Christened in the whole worlde. And if Peter had had power
ouer Kinges, &amp; Princes, it is not likely, he woulde haue taken vp his lodginge with
Cornelius the poore Tanner.<note place="margin">Actor. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> In the ende he concludeth with a terrour: <hi>If any
man repine against this statute, accursed be he.</hi> Wherein he dooth great wronge
bothe to S. Augustine, and also to al the Bishoppes of Aphrica, Numidia, Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritania,
Pentapolis, and Bizancena: who not onely repined openly against this
Canon, but also saide, It was falsified: and rebuked the Pope of pride, and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for the same.</p>
               <p>To be shorte, what leadeth M. Hardinge to saie, <hi>The Bishop of Rome hath these three
scoare and tenne Canons in safe keepinge?</hi> Why dooth he thus dissemble, &amp; mocke the world?
Certainely the Bishop of Rome himselfe vtterly disclaimeth it, and saith, He hath
them not. For thus he writeth touchinge the same: <hi>Viginti tantùm capitula Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae
Synodi in Sancta Romana Ecclesia habentur:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dist. 16. viginti. Stephanus pp.</note> 
                  <hi>sed quo neglectu alia defecerint, ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guum

But by what negligence the rest are loste, it is not knowen.</hi>
                  </hi> The Pope saithe, There are
but twentie Canons extant: M. Hardinge saithe, There are threscore and tenne
Canons. I trowe, It is no reason, we should beléeue M. Harding, &amp; leaue the Pope.</p>
               <p>But Steuin the Bishop of Rome saith, There were sometime in Rome the ful
thréescore and tenne Canons: whiche thinge he geathereth onely vpon this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerie
of M. Hardinges Athanasius. And the same beinge the euidence whereby
he holdeth his whole title, and suche euidence, as was not to be founde els where in
al the worlde, yet cannot he tel neither how he came by it, nor how longe he keapte
it, nor how he loste it. But a thinge is wel loste, that can not be auoutched, and
shewed without shame.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. Hardinges Athanasius saithe, <hi>Power to binde, and loose, is geuen to the holy See
of Rome by special priuilege aboue al others.</hi> And yet the olde Catholique Fathers
coulde neuer vnderstande any suche special priuilege. S. Cyprian saithe,</hi> Quamuis

                  <hi>but vnto the Seruice of the whole Churche.</hi> The Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palitie,
that <hi>Irenaeus</hi> meante, was the Ciuile Dominion, and temporal state of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
Citie of Rome, in whiche God had then planted the Empier of the worlde, and
made al Nations subiecte vnto it. And therefore the Churche of God beinge once
inkendled there, was more notable, and better knowen vnto al Nations. As for
the Bishops of Rome that then were, they had neither landes, nor rentes: but
liued stil vnder the swearde in continual persecution: as S. Paule saithe, <hi>The of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shauinge
of the worlde, and the vilest of al people,</hi> Farre from any shew, or colour of
Principalitie. Yet that notwithstandinge, the Churche there was called a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal,
and a chiefe Churche aboue others, bicause of the Dominion, and Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
of the Citie. And in this sense, <hi>Ecclesia principalis,</hi> Is sometime vsed in the
Olde Fathers.<note place="margin">7. Quest. 1. pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit.</note> In the Councel of Carthage it is written thus: <hi>Placuit, vt nemini

conferre. Wee thinke it good, it be lawful for no man, leauinge the principal Cheyre, or
Churche,<note place="margin">Inter Epistolas Augustini. ep. 35</note> to goe to any other Churche within the Diocese.</hi> Likewise Paulinus vnto Aly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius,
<hi>Dominus in suis te ciuibus principalem cum principibus populi sui, sede Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lica
meritò collocauit. The Lorde hath woorthily placed thee in the See Apostolique, a
principal one emonge his Citizens, with the Princes of his people.</hi> Thus the Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,
that <hi>Irenaeus</hi> meaneth, stoode not in the preachinge of the Gospel, but in the
Ciuile estate, and worldly Dominion: not in the Bishop that professed Christe,
but in the Emperour, that was an Heathen: not in the Churche, but in the perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors,
and enimies of the Churche. Therefore M. Hardinge reasoninge thus,
<hi>Rome had the power, and Princehoode of the worlde: Ergo, The Bishop there was Head of the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersal
Churche,</hi> séemeth not wel to weighe his owne Conclusion. For of the same
grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des wée might wel reason thus: <hi>Rome now hath loste that power, and Princehoode
of the worlde: <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Bishop there, is not now the Head of the Vniuersal Churche.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To be shorte, If the Churche of Rome woulde now faithfully kéepe the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and Doctrine of the Apostles, wée would frankely yelde her al that honour,
that <hi>Iraeneus</hi> geueth her. But she hath shaken of the yoke of Christe, and wilfully
breaketh Gods commaundementes, to thintent to vpholde her owne Traditions.
For proufe wherof, to passe ouer an infinite number of other disorders, the Bishop
there presumeth now to intitle him selfe,<note place="margin">Gregor. li. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>The Vniuersal Bishop.</hi> But S. Gregorie

                  <hi>Nemo decessorum meorum hoc tam profano vocabulo vti consensit. None of my

               <p>Certainely, if Peter had had the Uniuersal soueraintie ouer al the Apostles, he
shoulde haue had the like ouer S. Paule. And so perhaps M. Hardinge wil say:

               </p>
               <p>S. Ambrose, that the Glorie of the Gospel of Christe might the better appéere,
compareth it with the power, and puisance of the Empire of Rome, whiche then

Empire and soueraintie of al Nations.</hi>
                  </hi> Thus he séemeth to compare the Churche, with
the Citie: the power of the Gospel, with the power of the Empier: the Scepter of
the Crosse, with the Scepters of the Prince: and the Glorie of the one side, with the
Glorie of the other. Although Rome were glorious for the Empire, yet was she
muche more glorious for the Gospel. The Emperour there with his power sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
Nations: but the Gospel of Christe subdued the Emperour. Constantinus,
Theodosius, Ualentinianus, and other Emperours of Rome, with al their power
confessed them selues to be subiectes vnto Christe. And S. Ambrose writeth vnto
Ualentinian the Emperour,<note place="margin">Ambros. Epist. 32.</note> 
                  <hi>Quid honorificentius, quàm vt Imperator dicatur Filius
Ecclesiae? <hi>What canne be more honorable, then that the Emperour be called a childe of the
Churche?</hi>
                  </hi> This was the whole, and onely meaninge of S. Ambrose. And in that
sense S. Augustine saithe,<note place="margin">Augustin.</note>

                  </hi>
                  <pb n="248" facs="tcp:12563:138"/>
So likewise Chrysostome,<note place="margin">Ad populum</note> 
                  <hi>Contigit primùm Antiochiae Discipulos appellari Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anos.

                  </hi>
Therefore S. Ambroses meaning is, that Rome was neuer so noble before
for the Empier of the worlde, as it was afterwarde for the Gospel of Christe. But
S. Ambrose saith, <hi>Apostolici Sacerdo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Priesthoode,</hi>
                  </hi> With whiche woordes worldely eyes may soone be daseled. But M.
Hardinge knoweth, that S. Peter, beinge in Rome, had no manner shew, or state
of Princehoode. His whole power was spiritual, and stoode onely in the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinge
of the Gospel,<note place="margin">2. Corin. 10.</note> with whiche armour God is hable to pul downe Kinges and
Princes to the obedience of his Christe.<note place="margin">Hieremi. 1.</note> Thus saith God vnto Hieremie, <hi>Constitui

                  </hi> And S. Peter

<hi>You are that kingely Priesthoode.</hi>
                  </hi> This principalitie and tower of Religion was not
onely in Rome, but also in euery place, where the name of Christe was receiued.
Albeit, I graunte, bothe for the multitude of Idoles that there had beene honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and also for the nobilitie of the Empier, the Uictorie of Christe in Rome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
most glorious.</p>
               <p>Now let vs consider M. Hardinges reasoninge. <hi>The state of Rome was more famous
for the Gospel, then euer it had beene before for the Empier: <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Pope was called the

               <p>These places of S. Augustine may soone be answeared. For here is neither
Uniuersal Bishop: nor Head of the Uniuersal Churche: nor superioritie, or domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
ouer al others: nor any other woorde tendinge to that ende. M. Hardinge
knoweth,<note place="margin">Concil. Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginen. 3. Ca. 26.</note> that S. Augustine was present at the Councel of Carthage, and gaue
his consente, <hi>That the Bishop of the first See, should not be called neither the Prince, or
Chiefe of Priestes, nor the Highest Priest, nor by any other like title.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He knoweth also that S. Augustine afterward confirmed the same in a Councel
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:12563:139"/>
holden at <hi>Hippo Regius</hi> in his owne Diocesse.<note place="margin">Concil. Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen. Cap. 27.</note> Likewise he knoweth, that the
same S. Augustine Decréed amonge other Bishoppes to the number of.<note place="margin">Concil. Aphri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can. Cap. 92.</note> 217. in the
Councel of Aphrica, that it shoulde not be lawful for any man of those countreis,
to seeke for ayde ouer the Seas, and to appeale to the Bishop of Rome: and that
whosoeuer so appealed, shoulde stande Excommunicate: and so vtterly condemned
that Infinite Dominion, and Uniuersal Power, that so many haue sithence drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of.<note place="margin">Augustin. in Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han. tracta. 13.</note> Againe, writinge vpon the Gospel of S. Iohn he saith, <hi>Petrus erat ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus
in Capite, <hi>Peter was an eye in the Heade:</hi>
                  </hi> He saith not, Peter was the Heade. In
these woordes appeareth plainely S. Augustines certaine, and vndoubted iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente
touchinge this mater. The reast, that is here brought in, standeth onely
vpon M. Hardinges geatheringe.</p>
               <p>It is true, that as wel S. Augustine, as also other Godly Fathers, rightly,
and wel, in olde times yelded greate reuerence to the See of Rome, bothe for the
Antiquitie of the Churche: and for the honour and memorie of S Peter: and for
the constancie of the Holie Martyrs, that there had suffred: and also for the puritie
of Religion, whiche was preserued there a longe tyme without spotte, and might
be a standerde vnto others. But the greatest increase of outwarde estimation in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
worlde vnto that See,<note place="margin">Concil. Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinopol. 1. ca. 5.</note> was the Imperial Seate, and Presence of the Prince, as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
appeareth by the firste Councel of Constantinople.<note place="margin">Distinct. 22. Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

saith, <hi>The See of Rome had the highest place, and chiefe preeminence aboue others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Perhaps M. Hardinge wil presse me further with this woorde, <hi>Principatus:</hi>
whiche he expoundeth, <hi>The Principalitie.</hi> Howbeit, I beleue, he wil not saye, <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

signifieth an Uniuersal power, or Supreme gouernement: and so his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntage
of this woorde is not so greate. Uerily <hi>Princeps,</hi> in the Latine tongue,
is often vsed for a man, that for his vertue, or roome, or any singular qualitie, is
to be had in estimation aboue others.<note place="margin">De natura Deo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</note> So Cicero saith, <hi>Socrates princeps Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorum:

                  </hi> In these places, <hi>Princeps</hi> is taken, not for a Prince, or Gouernour, but
onely for a man, that for his qualities is to be estéemed aboue the reaste. And in
this sense S. Augustine calleth the See of Rome, as it was in his time, <hi>Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
Sedis Apostolicae,</hi> and not in respecte of any Supreme gouernement: for that
he himselfe in the Councel of Aphrica, as it is alreadie prooued, vtterly denied him.
I graunte, as S. Augustine saith, The Bishop of Rome truely, and diligently doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge
the parte of a Bishop, he that then woulde haue denied him the chiefe preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,
for the respectes aboue touched, had béene wicked, or arrogant. But the same
Bishop of Rome nowe claiming to him selfe the title of Uniuersal Bishop, as S.
Gregorie saithe,<note place="margin">Gregor. li. 6. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist. 30. &amp; li. 4. Epist. 39.</note> 
                  <hi>Is the Forerenner of Antichriste:</hi> and the consenting to the same,
as the same Gregorie saithe, <hi>Is the renouncinge and forsaking of the faithe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I coulde further saye, that M. Hardinge in these authorities of S. Augustine
hath leafte out, and transposed what he thought good: and so hath shewed no sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
dealinge. In the first place, S. Augustines woordes be these, <hi>Episcopus vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat

                  <hi>in which Churche the chiefe preeminence of
the Apostolique See had euer flourished.</hi> S. Augustine saith, <hi>The Bishop there was ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with the Churche of Rome, not by waye of Obedience, or Subiection, but by Letters of
Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ference,</hi> wherin is implied an equalitie, or a felowship. And afterwarde in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same
Epistle S. Augustine saith, That Meltiades the Bishop of Rome with certaine
other Bishops, hearde the mater betwéen <hi>Caecilianus</hi> and Donatus <hi>A casis nigris,</hi>
not by any his Uniuersal, or Supreme Power, as M. Harding imagineth, but by
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:12563:139"/>
special Commission from the Emperour. And so was the Bishop of Rome the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours
Delegate: and that, not in any Soueraine Authoritie, but felowlike, and
equally ioyned with other Bishops: and, That afterwarde the same cause vpon
complainte, and mislikinge of Donatus, was by the Emperour taken out of the
Bishop of Romes handes, and by a new Commission was put ouer to the hearing
of the Bishop of Arle in Fraunce. But where was then the Bishop of Romes
supreme gouernement?</p>
               <p>In the seconde place M. Hardinge hath notably falsified,<note place="margin">Augustin. li. 1.</note> bothe S. Augustines
woordes in the Latine,<note place="margin">Contra Epist.</note> and also his owne Translation in the Englishe. S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustines

Translation is thus, <hi>Thou thy selfe hast the preeminence ouer al, being in the toppe of the

<hi>Nec Petrus vindicauit sibi aliquid, aut arroganter assumpsit, vt diceret se primatum tenere,

others as Nouices, and vnderlinges should be obedient vnto him.</hi>
                  </hi> Al these thinges M. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

M. Hardinge, to note but the twoo lines that wente before, he should soone haue

therefore also saith S. Hierome, <hi>Vnlesse the Byshop haue a special power aboue others,
there wil be as many Schismes in the Church, as there be Priestes.</hi> But al these thinges thus
vttered generally of al Bishops, M. Hardinge wreasteth, and forceth onely vnto
one Bishop: and thus, that is General, he maketh Special: and, that is Special,
he maketh General, at his pleasure: and as before he misreported S. Cyprian, euen
so dooth he nowe likewise misreporte S. Hierome, and so shoareth vp a ruinous

               <p>But M. Hardinge wil say, S. Hierome vseth these special woordes, <hi>Summus
Sacerdos, <hi>The highest Priest:</hi>
                  </hi> whiche can not otherwise be taken, but onely of the
Pope. And therefore he gaue this note with a special Parenthesis <hi>(He mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth

               <p>Nowe, if M. Hardinge be hable by the Scriptures, or Holy Doctours, to say as
muche for the Bishop of Rome, that he is the Heade of the Churche, that is to say,
the Heade of Christes Bodie: or that the Church receiueth influence, or health from
him: Or that he is our Peace: or that we are al one in him: or that al the worlde is
one Flocke,<note place="margin">Ad Ephes. 4.</note> and one Folde, and he the one Sheepehearde: Or that S. Paule, as he
saide, There is one Lorde, one Faithe, one Baptisme, so he saide also, There is one
Pope: then haue we some cause, to thinke accordinge to M. Hardinges fantasie,
that the vnitie of the whole Churche is founded, and builte vpon the Pope. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely,
it seemeth, S. Augustine woulde not geue this priuilege vnto S. Paule.
His woordes be plaine,<note place="margin">August. contra literas Petilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni li. 3. Ca. 42. Iohan. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Nec Paulus radix eorum erat, quos plantauerat: sed ille potius,

he, that saith, I am the vine, and you are the sprigges. But the Heade of them how coulde he
be,<note place="margin">Ephes. 1.</note> seeinge he him selfe saithe, Al we in Christe are one Bodie: and, That of the whole Bodie
Christe him selfe is the Heade?</hi>
                  </hi> If S. Paule, as S. Augustine saithe, coulde not be
Heade of the Churche, howe may we then thinke, that the Bishop of Rome may be
Heade of the Churche?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But mankinde,</hi> saithe M. Hardinge, <hi>dependeth moste of sense: Therefore the whole Churche
must haue one man to rule and gouerne ouer it: and that man is Peters successour, and Christes Vicare
in Earthe.</hi> I maruel that none of the Olde Fathers coulde euer vnderstande, either
the necessitie of this reason, or this special name, and title of Christes Uicare. How
be it, one true woorde M. Harding hath vttered amongst many others: that is, that
to apointe Christe Uicare, it perteineth onely vnto Christe, and to none other. Of
whiche grounde we may wel reason thus: Christe neuer ordeined, nor appointed,
nor once named, the Bishop of Rome, or his Successoure to be his Uicare, that is,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:12563:143"/>
to be an Uniuersal Bishop ouer the whole Churche:<note place="margin">Christes Vicare.</note> therefore by M. Hardinges
owne position, the Bishop of Rome hath of longe time vsurped a power againste
Christe, without Commission, and in déede is not Christes Uicare. S. Hierome
saithe generally of al Bishoppes,<note place="margin">Hieronym. in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist. ad Titum.</note> 
                  <hi>Nouerint Episcopi, se magis Consuetudine, quàm
dispositionis Dominicae Veritate, Presbyteris esse maiores. <hi>Lette Bishoppes vnderstande,
that they be greater then the priestes by order, and Custome (of the Churche) and not by the
trueth of Goddes ordinance.</hi>
                  </hi> If Christe, as S. Hierome saithe, appointed not one priest
aboue an other, howe then is it likely, he appointed one Priest to be, as M. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge
saithe, Prince and ruler ouer al Priestes throughout the whole worlde?</p>
               <p>As for the Uniuersal supplieinge of Christes roome, Tertullian saithe, <hi>The
Holy Ghoste is Christes Vicare.</hi>

               <p>But bicause we are not onely ledde inwardely by Goddes Sprite, but also out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardely

                  </hi> Therefore saith S. Hierome, <hi>Potentia di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitiarum,

               <p>To conclude, M. Hardinge séemeth to reason thus, <hi>Mankinde dependeth moste of

in danger of great disorders, corruption, and vtter destruction, if, as occasion shalbe geuen, amonge
so great strifes and debates of men, amonge so many fier brandes of discorde, tossed to and fro by the
Diuelles, enemies of vnitie: there be not one heade and ruler, of al to be consulted, of al to be hearde, of
al to be folowed, and obeyed? If strife and contention be stirred about matters of Faith, if controuersie
happen to arise about the sense of the Scriptures, shal it not be necessary, there be one supreme iudge, to

               <p>If controuersie growe, aboute the vnderstandinge and sense of Goddes woorde,

Occam against Scotus: and Alliacensis against Occam: the Nominales against
the Reales: the Scholasticalles against the Canonistes: the contention is greater,
&amp; the doubtes darker, then euer they were before. Neither is there any resolution
to be hoped for, but onely of the Bishop of Rome: whome M. Hardinge calleth the

Thus that supreme Iudge, at whose onely handes M. Hardinge woulde haue
al the worlde to seeke for the very sense of Goddes woorde, as Alphonsus saithe,
may goe to schoole to learne his Grammar. And what if the Pope be an Heretique,

               <p>But here perhappes some wil say, it can not appeare by the euente of thinges, and practise of the

most euident. And here I might allege first certaine places of the New Testament, declaring, that Peter
practised this preeminence amonge the Disciples at the beginninge, and that they yelded the same, as
of right apperteininge vnto him. As when he first,<note place="margin">Act. 1.</note> and onely moued them to choose one in the steede of

the practise of the Churche is plainely reported to haue ben suche, as thereby the primacie of

Bishoppes in Rome, that folowed after him. And touchinge S. Peter, he
thinketh it sufficient to saie thus, <hi>Peter beinge amonge the rest, shewed his aduise firste
before al others: and at the sounde of his woordes, Ananias, and Saphira fel downe deade,
<hi>Ergo,</hi> Peter was the Heade, and had an Vniuersal power ouer the whole Churche.</hi> Here
be very weake proufes, to mainteine so greate a Title. I thinke M. Hardinge him
selfe doothe not beleue, that who so euer firste vttreth his minde in any Councel,
or woorketh any strange miracle by the power of God, is therefore the Heade of
al the worlde. For oftentimes in greate Councelles, the yongest, or lowest
beginneth firste: and the eldest, and Heade of al speaketh laste. Certainely, in this
assemblie of the Apostles, after that S. Peter had opened his minde, &amp; al the reast
had donne, last of al, not S. Peter,<note place="margin">Act. 15.</note> but S. Iames pronounced the Sentence, whiche
thinge belonged onely to the Heade, and President of that Councel. He must be

               <p>But who so euer wel, and throughly considereth S. Peters whole dealinge

               <p>Firste, for the appellation of Bishoppes to the see Apostolike, beside many other, we haue the
knowen examples of Athanasius that woorthy Bishoppe of Alexandria, and light of the worlde:
who hauinge susteined greate, and sundrie wronges at the Arianes, appealed firste to Iulius the
Pope, and after his deathe to Felix: of Chrysostome, who appealed to Innocentius against the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of Theophilus: of Theodoretus, who appealed to Leo. Neither made Bishoppes onely their
appeale to the Pope by their Delegates, but also in certaine cases, beinge cited, appeared before him in
their owne persons. Whiche is plainely gathered of Theodoretus his Ecclesiastical storie, who
writeth thus. Eusebius Bishop of Nicomedia (who was the chiefe piller of the Arianes) and
they that ioyned with him in that faction, falsely accused Athanasius to Iulius the Bishop of Rome.</p>

The false accusers went not to Rome, knowinge right wel, that their forged lye might easily be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended.
In the cause, and defence of Iohn Chrysostome, these Bishops came from Constantinople
to Innocentius the Pope, Pansophus Bishop of Pisidia, Pappus of Syria, Demetrius of the seconde Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,
and Eugenius of Phrygia. These were suiters for Chrysostome. He him selfe treated his mater
with Innocentius by writinge. In his Epistle emonge other thinges he writeth thus, Least this
outragious confusion runne ouer al, and beare rule euery where, write (<hi>I</hi> pray you) and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
by your auctoritie, suche wicked actes doone in our absence, and when we withdrewe not our
selues from iudgement, to be of no force, as by their owne nature truely they be voide, and vtterly
none. Furthermore, who haue committed these euils, 107<note place="margin">The .107. Vntruth, S. Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostomes vvordes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported.</note> put you them vnder the Censure of the

nor proued giltie of any crime: geue commaundement, that we be restored to our Churches againe,
that we maie enioye the accustomed charitie, and peace with our bretherne. Innocentius, after that
he vnderstoode the whole mater, pronounced, and Decreed, the iudgement of Theophilus, that was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Chrysostome, to be voyde, and of no force. This whole tragedie is at large set foorthe by Palla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius
Bishop of Helenopolis <hi>In vita Iohannis Chrisostomi,</hi> who liued at that time. By this Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale
of Chrysostome, and by the whole handelinge of the mater, and specially by the purporte of his
Epistle to Innocentius, The Superioritie of the Pope is euidently acknowleged. And so is it plainely
confessed by Athanasius, and the Bishoppes of Aegypte, Thebais, and Lybia, assembled in Councel at
Alexandria, by these woordes of their Epistle to Foelix, <hi>Vestrum est enim nobis manum porri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere
&amp;c.</hi> It is your parte (saye they) to streatche foorthe your helpinge hande vnto vs, because we are
committed vnto you. It is your parte to defende vs, and deliuer vs: it is our parte to seeke helpe of
you, and to obey your Commaundementes. And a litle after: For we knowe that you beare the cure,
and charge of the Vniuersal Churche, and specially of Bishoppes, who in respecte of their contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and speculation, are called the eyes of our Lorde, as alwaies the Prelates of your See, firste the
Apostles, then their Successours haue doone.</p>
               <p>Theodoretus that learned Bishop of Cyrus, beside the Epistle he wrote to Leo for succour and helpe
in his troubles, in an other, that he wrote to Renatus a priest neare aboute Leo, sayeth thus, <hi>Spolia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt
me Sacerdotio &amp;c.</hi> They haue violently robbed me of my Bishoprike, they haue caste me foorth
of the Cities, neither hauinge reuerenced mine age spente in Religion, nor my hoare heares VVhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>I</hi> beseeche thee, that thou perswade the most holie Archebishop (he meaneth Leo) to vse his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolike
auctoritie, and to commaunde vs to come vnto your Councel, or Consistorie. For this Holie See
holdeth the Rudther, and hath the gouernement of the Churches of the whole worlde, partely for
other respectes, but specially for that it hath euermore continued cleare from stinche of Heresie, and
that none euer sate in it, who was of contrary opinion, but rather hath euer kepte the Apostolike
grace vndefiled. In whiche woordes of Theodoretus, this chiefely is to be marked, that the holie
See of Rome (as he saithe) hath the gouernment of the Churches of al the worlde, most for this cause,
that it was neuer infected with Heresie, as al other Churches founded by the Apostles were.</p>

               <p>Firste therefore I must shewe, that there laye no such ordinarie Appeale from al

sufficiently appeare, bothe by Chrysostomes owne Epistles, and by the Bishop of
Romes dealinge herein, and by the ende, and Conclusion of the cause. Touching
Chrysostome him selfe, he maketh no mention of any Appeale: nor desireth the
parties to be cited to Rome: nor taketh Innocentius for the Bishop of the whole

                  </hi>
And againe in the same Epistle, he vtterly auoideth al such foren Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes,
accordinge to the determinations of the Councelles of Carthage, Mileui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,

that not before him selfe, but onely before the Councel of sundrie Bishoppes sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned
specially for that purpose. For thus Iulius writeth vnto the Bishops
of the East:</hi>

to the Councel? <hi>Here he exhorteth, and intreateth them: he commaundeth them not:
he calleth them to come, not before him selfe, but before the Councel. Againe he
saith, <hi>Legati vestri Macarius Presbyter, &amp; Hesychius Diaconus,</hi>

                  <hi>For so Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasius

<hi>Which thinge Iulius also him selfe auoucheth by these woordes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epist. Iulij in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologia Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasij. 2.</note>

owne minde onely, that I wrote, but also the minde of the Bishoppes of Italie, and of al other
Bishoppes of these Countries.</p>
               <p>So likewise Innocentius the Bishop of Rome,<note place="margin">Nicephorus li. 13. Ca. 33.</note> being very desirous to restoare
Chrysostome, and to recouer the vnitie of the Churche, not of him selfe, or by his
owne authoritie, but by the Decrée, and consent of a Councel holden in Italie,
sente Messingers into the East. And sittinge with others in the Councel, he tooke
not vpon him that Uniuersal power, that is now imagined, but had his voice e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
with his brethren, as it appeareth by Meltiades Bishop of Rome,<note place="margin">Optatus li. 2.</note> that satte
with three Bishoppes of Gallia, and fourtéene other Bishoppes of Italie, to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the controuersie betwéene <hi>Caecilianus,</hi> and <hi>Donatus a casis nigris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, to come to the prosecution of the mater, M. Hardinge knoweth, that the
Bishoppes of the East vnderstoode not this singular Authoritie, or Prerogatiue of
the Bishop of Rome, and therefore beinge called, obeied not the summon, nor had
any regarde vnto his sentence, as it is many waies easy to be séene. Therefore
they returned vnto Iulius this answeare:<note place="margin">Inter Decreta Iulij, Concil. tomo 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Si nostris placitis assentiri volueritis, pacem

                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This imperfection, and weakenesse of their owne dooinges, the Bishoppes of
Rome them selues vnderstoode, and confessed. For thus Innocentius writeth vnto
S. Augustine, Alypius, and others in Aphrica touchinge Pelagius:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Inter Decreta Innocentij, Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stol. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>Si adhuc tali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
sentit, cvm sciat se damnandum esse, quibus acceptis literis, aut quandose nostro iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio

<pb n="271" facs="tcp:12563:150"/>
that I wil pronounce against him, at what request of letters, or when wil he commit him selfe
to our iudgement? If it be good, he were called to make answeare, it were better some others
called him, that are neare at hande &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And therfore Iulius the Bishop of Rome, findinge his owne infirmitie herein,
wrote vnto the Emperour Constans,<note place="margin">Sozomenus li. 3. Ca. 10.</note> and opened vnto him the whole mater, and
besought him to write vnto his brother Constantius, that it might please him, to
sende the Bishops of the East, to make answeare to that, they had doone against
Athanasius. Euen so the Cleargie of the Citie of Antioche, in the like case of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and spoile, wrote vnto Iohn the Patriarke of Constantinople,<note place="margin">Concil. Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinopol. quintu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Actio. 1.</note> to intreate the
Emperour in their behalfe. It appeareth hereby, that this Infinite Authoritie,
and Prerogatiue power ouer al the worlde, in those daies was not knowen.</p>
               <p>I thinke it hereby plainely, and sufficiently prooued, first that the Bishop of
Rome had no authoritie to receiue appeales from al partes of the worlde, and that
by the Councelles of Nice, of Tele, of Mileuitum, and of Aphrica: by S. Cyprian,
and by the Emperours Martian, and Iustinian. Nexte, that M. Hardinge, the
better to furnishe his mater, hath notoriousely falsified Chrysostomes woordes,
thrée times in one place. Thirdely, that Chrysostomes letter vnto Innocentius
conteined mater of complainte, but no appeale: whiche thinge is also prooued by
the very woordes, and tenour of the letter: by the Bishoppes of Romes owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession:
and by the imperfection, and weakenesse of their dooinges. For the
lawe saith, <hi>Iurisdictio sine modica coerctione nulla est. Iurisdiction without some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pussion
is no Iurisdiction.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De officio eius, cui mandata est Iurisdictio. Mandatam.</note>
               </p>
               <p>In déede by way of compromisse, and agréement of the parties, maters were
sometimes brought to be hearde, and ended by the Bishoppe of Rome, as also by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Bishoppes: but not by any ordinarie processe, or course of Lawe. And so it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth,
this mater betwéene Athanasius, and the Arians was first brought vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Iulius: for that the Arians willingely desired him, for trial therof, to cal a
Councel. For thus Iulius him selfe writeth vnto the Bishoppes of the East, as
it is before alleged.<note place="margin">Epist. Iulij, in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologia Atha. 2.</note>

iniurie. But now, seeinge the same men, whom you tooke to be graue, and woorthy of credite,
haue made suite vnto mee, that I should cal you, verily, ye should not take it in il parte.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hereby it is plaine, that Iulius tooke vpon him to cal these parties, not by
any suche Uniuersal Iurisdiction, as M. Hardinge fansieth, but onely by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
and request of bothe parties. And therefore Iulius saith, He caused Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius
to be cited <hi>Regulariter,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Regulariter.</note> that is, according to order: for the order of iudgement
is, that a man be first called, and then accused, and last of al condemned: but he
meaneth not thereby the order of the Canons, as M. Hardinge expoundeth it. For
touchinge appeales to Rome, there was no Canon yet prouided. The counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feite
Epistle of Athanasius to Felix is answeared before.</p>
               <p>Theodoretus<note place="margin">Theodoretus.</note> was deposed, and bannished, and cruelly intreated, as it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
by his letters vnto Renatus: and therfore, the woordes, that he vseth, are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
tokens of his miseries, and wante of healpe, then certaine testimonies of his
iudgement. For euery man is naturally inclined to extolle him, and to auance
his power, at whose hande he seeketh healpe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="272" facs="tcp:12563:150"/>But if it were graunted, it was lawful then for the Bishoppe of Rome, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
al manner appeales, in such order, as it is pretended, yet cannot M. Harding
thereof necessarily conclude, that the Bishop of Rome was the Head of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersal
Churche. For Ostiensis saith, <hi>Appeales may be made, not onely from the lower
Iudge vnto the higher, but also from equal to equal:</hi> And in this order, as it shal after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
be shewed more at large, <hi>Donatus a Casis nigris,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">August. epist. 162 Extra. de appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lationib. in Sexto. Roma. Ecclesi. In Glosa.</note> was by the Emperour
lawfully remooued from the Bishop of Rome, to the Bishop of Arle in Fraunce.</p>
               <p>Ostiensis woordes be these, <hi>Non nocebit error, si appelletur ad Maiorem, quàm debu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erit,
vel ad parem. The errour shal not hurte, if the appeale be made, either to a higher Iudge,
then was meete, or to an equal.</hi> Where also it is thus noted in the Margin, <hi>Appellari
potest ad parem, si de hoc sit consuetudo. Appeale may be made vnto the equal, if there be
a custome of it.</hi> Hereby it is plaine, that the right of appeale by fine force of Law,
concludeth not any necessarie superioritie: muche lesse this infinite power ouer the
whole Uniuersal Churche.</p>
               <p>But M. Harding might soone haue foreséene, that this his first principle of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peales
woulde easily be turned against him selfe.</p>
               <p>First, for that it is wel knowen, that Appeales then, euen in the Ecclestastical <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
causes, were made vnto the Emperours, and Ciuile Princes.</p>
               <p>Secondely, for that the Bishop of Rome determined suche cases of Appeale,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
by warrant, and Commission from the Emperour.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, for that maters beinge once hearde, and determined by the Bishop <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
of Rome, haue béene by appeale from him remooued further vnto others.</p>
               <p>As touchinge the first,<note place="margin">Eusebi. li. 10. ca. 5.</note> that appeales in Ecclesiastical causes were lawfully

               <p>Here it is euident to be seene, that the Bishop of Rome was the Emperours
Delegate, and in Ecclesiastical Iurisdiction had his authoritie, and power (not
from S. Peter) but from the Emperour. Whereby it is easie to be geathered,
that the Bishoppe of Romes power was not so Uniuersal then, as M. Hardings
woulde séeme now to make it: and that the worlde then vnderstoode not this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crée
of Pope Clemens the fifth,<note place="margin">Clemens. 5.</note> whiche, as it is reported, he afterwarde published
in the Councel of Uienna, <hi>Omne ius Regum pendet a Papa: Al the right of the Prince

               </p>
               <p>Neither was the Bishop of Romes determination of suche force, but that it
was lawful then for the partie greeued, to refuse his Iudgement, and to appeale
further. And therefore Donatus beinge condemned before Miltiades appealed
from him, and vpon his complaint vnto the Emperour, was put ouer vnto the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop

that he sate in iudgement, and hearde bothe parties.</p>
               <p>Now, if receiuing of appeales necessarily importe this Uuiuersal power, then
was the Emperours power Uniuersal: for he receiued al appeales out of al Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
without exception, and that euen in Causes Ecclesiastical. Againe, then was
the Bishop of Romes power not Uniuersal: for it was lawful then to refuse him,
and to appeale to some other. And thus M. Hardinges reasons renne roundely
against him selfe,</p>

S. Augustine affirmeth the same. VVhiche special Grace, and singular Priuilege, is to be imputed

               <p>For better credite hereof, that is earnestly to be considered, whiche S. Augustine writeth, Episto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la

that was Pope in his time, he saithe thus, <hi>In illum ordinem Episcoporum &amp;c.</hi> In to that rewe
of Bishops, that reacheth from Peter him selfe to Anastasius, which now sitteth in the same Chayre,
if any traitour had creapte in, it shoulde nothinge hurte the Churche, and the innocent Christen folke,
ouer whom our Lorde hauinge prouidence, saithe of euil rulers:<note place="margin">Matth. 23.</note> VVhat they saye vnto you, doo ye, but

be compelled to saye good thinges. For the thinges whiche they saye, be not theirs, but Goddes, who in
the seate of vnitie, hath put the doctrine of veritie.</p>
               <p>By this we are plainely taught, that al be it the successours of Peter Christes Vicares in earthe, be
found blame woorthy for their euil life, yet we ought not to dissent from them in Doctrine, nor seuer
our selues from them in Faithe. For as muche as, notwithstandinge they be euil, by Gods prouidence
for the suretie of his people, they be compelled to saye the thinges, that be good, and to teache the
truthe: the thinges they speake, not beinge theirs, but Gods, who hath put the doctrine of veritie,
in the seate or chayer of vnitie: whiche singular Grace commeth specially to the See of Peter, eyther
of the force of Christes prayer, as is saide before, or in respecte of place, and dignitie, whiche the
Bishops of that See holde for Christe,<note place="margin">M. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth the Pope vvith Balaam and Caiphas.</note> as Balaam coulde be brought by no meanes to curse that people,
whom God woulde haue to be blessed. And Caiphas also prophesied, bicause he was high Bishop
of that yeere, and prophesied truely, beinge a man otherwise most wicked. And therefore the euil doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inges
of Bishops of Rome, make no argument of discreditinge their Doctrine. To this purpose the
example of Gregorie Nazianzene maye very fittely be applied, of the Golden, Siluerne, and Leaden
Seale. As touchinge the value of Metalles, Golde and Siluer are better, but for the goodnesse of the
Seale, as wel dooth Leade imprinte a figure in waxe, as Siluer or Golde. For this cause that the
See of Rome hathe neuer ben defiled with stinkinge Heresies, as Theodoretus saithe, and God hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
keapte in that Chaire of Vnitie, the doctrine of Veritie, as Augustine writeth: For this cause
(I saye) it sitteth at the sterne, and gouerneth the Churches of the whole worlde: For this cause Bishops
haue made their Appellations thither, iudgement in doubtes of Doctrine, and determination in al

three Delegates, or Vicares, now commonly they be named Legates. And this for the commoditie of

               <p>What wée may thinke of the other Hundred proufes, whiche M. Hardinge, as

that withstoode the proude attempte of the Bishops of Rome, and founde out their
open forgerie in falsifieinge the Nicene Councel, were altogeather inflamed, and
leadde by the Diuel.</p>
               <p>But howe doothe this appeare to M. Hardinge, that the Bishop of Rome had
al the Bishops of the East in Subiection, to vse, and commaunde them, as his
Seruantes? In what Councel was it euer Decréed it shoulde be so? who subscribed
it? who recorded it? who euer sawe suche Canons?<note place="margin">Nicolaus. <hi>PP.</hi> ad Michaelem Imperat.</note> The best Plea, that Pope Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colas
can make in this behalfe, is, that Peter was firste Bishop of Antioche, and
after of Rome: and S. Marke his Scholar Bishop of Alexandria. Hereof, he thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth,
it may verie wel and substantially be geathered, that the Bishops of Rome
ought to haue al the worlde in Subiection. In déede in the counterfaite Chartar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
or Donation of the Emperour Constantine, authoritie is geuen to the Bishop of
Rome ouer the other foure Patriarkes, of Antioche, of Alexandria, of Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,
and of Hierusalem. But the Bishops of Rome them selues, and of them
selues diuised and forged this Chartar, and that so fondely, that a verie Childe
maye easily espie the folie. For biside a greate number of other vntruethes, at
that very time, when it is imagined, that Chartar was drawen, there was neither
Patriarke, nor Bishop, nor Priest, nor Churche in Constantinople, nor the Citie
it selfe yet builte, nor knowen to the worlde by that name. This notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge,
the Bishop of Rome vpon this simple title, hathe besette his Miter with
thrée Crownes, in token, that he hath the Uniuersal power ouer the thrée Diuisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the worlde, Europa, Asia, and Aphrica. And so as the Kinge of Persia
in olde tymes intitled him selfe, <hi>Frater Solis, &amp; Lunae,</hi> euen so Pope Nicolas<note place="margin">Nicol. <hi>PP.</hi> ad Michaelem Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratorem: Princeps super omnem terram. Concil. Nicen. Can. 6.</note> calleth

               <p>But what dutie the Bishops of the East partes owed to the Bishops of Rome,
whosoeuer hath read, and considered the storie and practise of the times, may soone
perceiue. Firste the Councel of Nice appointed euery of the thrée Patriarkes to
his seueral charge, none of them to interrupte, or trouble other: and willed the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppe

                  <pb n="280" facs="tcp:12563:154"/>For proufe of this authoritie, the Epistle of Cyprian whiche he wrote to Stephanus Pope in his
time, against Martianus the Bishop of Arelate in Gallia, maketh an euident argument. For that this
Martianus became a mainteiner of the Heresie of Nouatianus, and therewith seduced the faithful
people. Cyprian hauinge intelligence of it by Faustinus from Lions, aduertised Stephanus of it, and
moued him earnestly to directe his letters to the people of Arle, by auctoritie of whiche, Martianus
shoulde be deposed, and an other put in his roome, to the intent (saith he there) the flocke of Christe.
whiche hitherto by him scattered abroade and wounded, is contemned, maye be gathered togeather.

               <p>Nowe, if M. Hardinge wil reason thus,
<q>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Then of the same principle we may wel to the contrary reason thus:
<q>
                     <p>The Pope him selfe was Excommunicate by other Bishoppes:

it good, that letters shoulde be sente vnto al the Bishops of this Prouince, that al our bretherne

the Catholique Churche. <hi>If M. Hardinge wil say, This was not the Confirmation of

with moste manifest, and most certaine Confirmation. <hi>Thus when so euer any Bishop
was eyther installed, or deposed, knowledge thereof was geuen vnto the other
Bishops, and the same either allowed, or disallowed by his brethren.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that the Bishop of Rome ordered, and admitted al the Bishops through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the worlde, bysides that it hath no possibilitie, or coloure of trueth in it selfe, it
is also easie by good recorde, and authoritie to be reproued. Agapetus Bishop of
Rome, about the yeere of our Lorde. 540. after he had vpon occasion Consecrate
Menna, the Bishop of Constantinople, he vttered these woordes in commendation

of a General allowance, suche as was common to al Bishops, specially to the foure

that it might appeare, there was no Bishop in the Churche, but was liked,

Councel had set forth rules, the whiche (saithe he) the Curche of Rome receiued, and confirmed. The
seconde general Councel holden at Constantinople, was likewise allowed and approued by Damasus,
specially requested by the fathers of the same, thereto. So was the thirde Councel holden at Ephesus
ratified, and confirmed by Coelestinus, who had there, for his Vicares, or deputes, Cyrillus the famouse
Bishop of Alexandria, and one Arcadius a Bishop out of Italie. As for the fourthe Councel kepte at
Chalcedon, the fathers thereof also in their Epistle to Leo the Pope, subscribed with the handes of .44.
Bishoppes, made humble request vnto him, to establishe, fortifie, and allowe, the Decrees, and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
of the same. This beinge founde true, for the fower first chief Councelles, we nede not to saie
any thinge of the rest that folowed. But for the suer proofe of al this, that chiefly is to be alleaged,
that Constantius the Arian Emperour made so importune, and so earnest sute to Liberius the Pope, to

neither woulde they haue appeared vpon his Summon. Gregorius beinge Bishop
of Rome, coulde not cause the Bishop of Salonae beinge but one man, to come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

yet woulde neither of them alter one daie, but charged eche man to appeare, as
they were Summoned. And Leo the Bishop of Rome with al his Uniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal

true it is, either that Pope Gelasius writeth, <hi>That onely the Apostolique

               <p>Neither was the Bishop of Rome, nor his legate in his absence, euermore the

               <p>Pope Nicolas, as vpon occasion I saide before, was the second Bishop in Rome

Wherefore his authoritie might wel haue beene spared. It is wel knowen, that as
the Popes power increased, so the Empire abated. Therefore was Platyna forced

               <p>As touching the restoaring of Athanasius, Pope Iulius intreated Themperour

                  </hi> More ouer, for that he was a
Patriarke, he summoned a particular Councel, and laboured the Bishoppes. For
the Arians saide:<note place="margin">Sozomen. li. 4. ca. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>There was on Ecclesiastical Canon, That noman beinge once deposed

                  <note place="margin">Orientalium Epistola ad Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium.</note> And therfore Chrysostome was muche blamed of his aduersaries, for

               <p>Concerning that is here touched of Eulalius, the mater néedeth no longe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweare.
The storie beinge truely knowen, is sufficient to answeare it selfe. It
is certaine, as wée haue before declared more at large, and as it plainely appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
by the Actes of the Councel of Aphrica, that Zosimus the Bishop of Rome,
to the intente to auance him selfe ouer al other Bishoppes, manifestly falsified the
Nicene Councel. This forgerie in the Councel of Aphrica was disclosed, &amp; laide
abroade to the eyes of al the worlde. The Bishoppes there beinge in number twoo
hundred and seuentiene, saw, that one Apiarius a Priest, whom they for his open
oultrage, and wickednesse had Excommunicate, was without any further exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge
of the mater, onely vpon his bare complainte, admitted againe vnto the
Communion, and receiued into fauour, in despite of al their dooinges, by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppe
of Rome.</p>
               <p>They saw, that the accusers, and witnesses, without whom no ordinarie
iudgement can procéede, either for age, or for sickenesse, &amp; other causes, coulde not
wel trauel so farre. Therefore they desired the Bishop of Rome by their letters,
that he woulde bringe no suche ambitious puffe of vanitie into the Churche:<note place="margin">Fumosum saeculi Typhum.</note> and
made a straite Decrée in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Councel emonge them selues, that it should not be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for any man, to appeale out of Aphrica to any foren Bishop. An hundred
yéeres after that, this Eulalius the Bishop of Carthage, if it be true that is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of him, and not forged at Rome, as were many thinges moe, reconciled him
selfe to the Churche of Rome, in the time of Bonifacius the Seconde, as it is recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

of Penance: nor of Subiection, or humble Submission. In déede this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerander
at his firste entrie into the Bishoprike of Antioche, findinge his Churche
ful of Diuision, by meane of one Eustathius, by his wisedome, and Godly exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
brought the whole people there vnto vnitie:<note place="margin">Theodoret. li. 5. Ca. 25.</note> and afterwarde wrought the

Churche professed, receiued them vnto the Communion, and wrote fauourably
vnto the Bishoppes of the East in their behalfe. These Messingers departinge
thence went into Sicilie, and in a Councel of the Bishoppes there likewise Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
them selues vnto them: and beinge returned home, they sent abroade into al
the Churches of those countries, and willed them to consider the letters sent from
Liberius the Bishop of Rome, and from other Bishops of Italie, Aphrica, France,
Sicilie, and al the Weast, and to agrée, and to Communicate togeather with them.</p>
               <p>An other like example of Reconciliation we haue made by one Arsenius the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop

of Rome was euer called an Vniuersal Bishop, or Head of the Vniuersal Churche, and maketh him selfe
very suer of it: although it be a childishe thing to sticke at the name any thing is called by, the thing by

which is one, to witte, Bishop, or principal father of the whole worlde, and also Head of the
Church. Leo that worthy B. of Rome, was called the Vniuersal Bishop, and Vniuersal Patriarke, of sixe
hundred and thirtie Fathers assembled togeather from al partes of the worlde in General Councel at
Chalcedon: whiche is bothe 118<note place="margin">The .118. vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>truth. There is no mention made here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in any Canon in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel.</note> expressed in that Councel, and also clearely affirmed by S. Gregorie
in three sundrie Epistles to Mauritius the Emperour, to Eulogius Patriarke of Alexandria, and to Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasius
Patriarke of Antioche. Thus that name was deferred vnto the Pope by the Fathers of that
greate Councel: whiche by them had not beene doone, had it beene vnlawful. In very deede neither Leo
him selfe, nor any other his successour, euer called or wrote him selfe by that name, as S. Gregorie saith,

and called him the Uniuersal Bishop: whiche thinge (as he saith) is recorded by S.
Gregorie in thrée sundrie places. Here, good Christian Reader, by the way, this one
thinge (I trust) thou wilt consider of thée selfe. If the name of Uniuersal Bishop
were geuen to the Bishop of Rome in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Councel of Chalcedon, which was holden

throughout the worlde: and yet al the reast of the same Councel remaine safe: Or
that the woords, wherby the Pope claimeth his title, should so negligently be lost,
and that in Rome it selfe, in the Popes owne Librarie: and yet the woordes that
the Pope reprooueth, and condemneth, shoulde stande whole. M. Hardinge hath
no other Councel within sixe hundred yéeres after Christe to holde by, but onely
this. And yet the same cannot be founde. But S. Gregorie is witnesse suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent:
He saith, <hi>that .630. Bishops in the Councel of Chalcedon, named the Bishop of Rome
the Vniuersal Bishop.</hi> This is an vntrueth to beguile the Reader. For Gregorie
saith not, the Bishoppes in that councel Saluted, Intitled, Proclaimed, or Called

                  <hi>The name of Vniuersal Bishop, was offered by the Councel of Chalce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don

               <p>The Bishops of Rome neuer vsed that name, notwithstandinge it were offered

               <p>M. Hardinge wil say, <hi>This was onely their humilitie, and not wante of right.</hi> And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

                  </hi>
Uerily it may wel be thought, that Gregorie, who first vsed these woordes, as his
familiar stile, named him selfe so without Hypocrisie, onely in respecte of his into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable

that it was iniurious vnto other Bishops, &amp; a corruption of the Faith: and for the

in thrée sundrie Epistles: the one sent by one Athanasius a Priest: the other by one

whole number of sixe hundred, and thirtie Bishoppes there assembled, I trow M.
Hardinge is not wel hable to shew, that any one euer saluted, or called him so.</p>
               <p>Therefore, whereas M. Hardinge, the better to put his Reader in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,
hath sette this note in the Margine, that the Bishop of Rome was called

M. Hardinge hath chosen to builde vpon.</p>
               <p>But what are these Olde Fathers taught to saye? Or howe is M. Hardinge
relieued by their woordes? In the Salutation before their letters they write thus,
<hi>Sixtus, Pontianus, Victor, Bishop of the Vniuersal Churche. This</hi> (saithe M. Hardinge)

                     </hi> there is no manner difference.</hi> O what
ranginge, and huntinge here is, to beate vp that thinge, that wil not be founde.
M. Hardinge, bicause he can not finde the Uniuersal Bishop, that he sought for,
therefore he hath sought out the nexte of kinne, that is, The Bishop of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersal
Churche: and these two, he saithe, be both one. Howbeit, this mater néede<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

no greate séekinge: euery Childe might soone haue founde it. But if an Uniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal

is it true,<note place="margin">Gregor. li. 4. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist. 32 &amp; 36.</note> that S. Gregorie saithe, <hi>Nemo decessorum &amp;c. <hi>None of my Pred<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

woulde euer consent to this name?</hi>

Uniuersal Bishop, and beare so easily with the name of Bishop of the Uniuersal
Churche, which, he knew, his Predecessours had vsed, if he tooke them bothe for
one thinge, without difference? To be shorte, if these names, as M. Hardinge
assureth him selfe, be bothe one, howe is the one Godly, the other Ungodly: the
one Arrogant, the other not Arrogant: the one blasphemous, the other not blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous?</p>
               <p>This errour riseth of misvnderstandinge these woordes, <hi>Vniuersalis Ecclesia.</hi>
For the Churche Uniuersal, and the Churche Catholique, the one beinge Gréeke,
the other Latine, are bothe one: and are commonly vsed of the learned Fathers,
as contrary to a Particular Churche, as be the Churches of Heretiques, &amp; Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiques.
In this sence, euery Godly Bishop, is a Bishop of the Catholique, or
Uniuersal Churche: like as also euery Godly man is a member of the same. Thus

he were plaieinge at poste, and shoulde winne al by vicinge. He saithe, If M. Iuel

not learned. To contende for learninge, it were a childishe folie. He is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
learned, that saith the trueth. But if M. Hardinge with al his learninge be
hable to finde out his Heade of the Churche, he shal haue his request: I wil graunt
him to be learned.</p>
               <p>He saithe, <hi>The Bishop of Rome is so named, either in termes equiualent, or expressely.</hi> Thus
he doubteth at the mater, and stammereth, and faltereth at the beginninge. But
if the Bishop of Rome were the Heade of the Churche in déede, and so allowed, and
taken in the worlde, why was he neuer expressely, and plainely named so? Was

must néedes importe thus muche, That the Bishop of Rome is aboue al
General Councelles: that he onely hath power to expounde the Scriptures, and
cannot erre, nor be iudged of any man: and that without him, there is no health:
and that al the worlde ought to know him for the Uniuersal Heade, vpon paine of
damnation. Thus muche the Pope him selfe claimeth by that name. If M. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinges
termes sounde not thus, they are not equiualent. It had beene the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pler,

               <p>As for the mater, the question is moued of the Bishop of Rome: the answeare
is made of S. Peter: as if S. Peter continued there Bishop stil vntil this daie.
But it is presumed, that, what so euer priuilege was in Peter, the same muste

Churche of Rome.<note place="margin">Ambros. lib. 10. Epist. 81.</note> And writinge vnto Siricius the Bishop of Rome, he calleth

saith thus. Neither was this man onely suche a one, but he also which was the heade of the Apostles,
who oftentimes saide, he was readie to bestowe his life for Christ, and yet was ful sore afraied of

                  </hi> These names, as I haue saide, of Affection, and fauour haue been geuen:
yet wil not M. Hardinge therefore say, that, either the Emperour ought to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Head of al men vpon earth: Or the Kinge, Christes Uicare: Or Elias, the
Head of the Prophetes: Or Cyrillus, the Head of the Councel: Or S. Paule, the
Head of Nations: Or the Bishop of Rome, God, or Christe: as by an vsual, and
ordinarie Title. And although, as I haue saide, S. Peters titles be nothinge
incident to this Question, yet wée may examine M. Hardinges argument tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinge
the same.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Peter <hi>(saith he)</hi> was Head of the Apostles:
<lb/>
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> He was Head of other inferiour people: And so Head of the Vniuersal Churche.</p>
               </q>
               <p>This is a deceiteful kinde of argument, and riseth by degrees, and steppes: and
in the Schooles is called <hi>Sorites.</hi> In like sorte M. Harding might conclude thus:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Elias, as Chrysostome saith, was Head of the Prophetes:
<lb/>
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> He was Head of the inferiour people: And so of the whole Vniuersal Church.</p>
               </q>
               <p>But the errour hereof wil better appeare by that argument, that The misto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
the gouernour of Athens sometimes made of him selfe, his wife, &amp; his childe.
Thus he saide:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>The people of Athens is ruled by mee: I am ruled by my wife:
My wife is ruled by my childe:
<lb/>
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> The people of Athens is ruled by my Childe.</p>
               </q>
               <p>In this Reason, this one woorde, <hi>Rule,</hi> hath thrée significations. For The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mistocles
ruled, as a Gouernour: His wife, as a Shrew: his Childe, as a wanton.
And therein standeth the errour of the argument. So likewise this woorde, <hi>Head,</hi>
signifieth sometime the chiefe in learninge: sometime the chiefe in dignitie: some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
the chiefe in Gouernement. And hereof also in reasoning riseth great errour.
For it were greate folie to reason thus: Paule in learninge, and dignitie was the
Head of al others: <hi>Ergo,</hi> He was the Head in Gouernment ouer al others.</p>
               <p>Touching Uictor, that wrote the Storie of the Uandales, he is neither Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
nor Councel, nor Doctour, nor writeth the Order, or Practise of the primitiue
Churche: nor is it wel knowen, either of what credite he was, or when he liued:
nor dooth he cal the Bishop of Rome the Head of the Uniuersal Churche. Onely he
saith, <hi>Rome is the Chiefe, or Head Churche of al others.</hi> Whiche thinge of our parte, for
that time, is not denied: as may better appeare by that is written before in sundrie
places of this Article.<note place="margin">Prudentius i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Thus, as Iulianus the Emperour in his phrenesie sometimes imagined, that the
Great Aleranders Soule was come by Succession to dwel in him: euen so now the
Bishops of Rome imagine by like fantasie, or phrenesie, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> S. Peters Soule com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
by Succession to dwell in them: &amp; that therefore they ought to haue, what
so euer Title, or Interest Peter had. And for that cause they say, <hi>We are Peters

                  <hi>Christe I know: and Paule

he was Bishop of Rome. For he was so appointed by Christe, in considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of age, and boldenes of Sprite, longe before he came to Rome: Yea, and had so

Hardinges argument is a <hi>Fallax,</hi> and in the Schooles is called <hi>Fallacia accidentis.</hi>
               </p>

&amp;c. metuenda est. Ideo non video, quomodo sint excusati à Schismatis reatu, qui huic
voluntati contrauenientes, sese à Romani Pontificis auctoritate subtrahunt. Ecce haec est
vna prima mihi insuperabilis ratio, quae me subijcit Romano Pontifici, &amp; primatum eius
confiteri cogir.</hi> The first thinge, that moueth me to thinke the Bishop of Rome to be ouer al other,
that we knowe to be Bishoppes, is the very wil of God, which we see in the facte, or deede it selfe.
For without the wil of God the Bishop of Rome coulde neuer haue ben commen vnto this Monarchie.
But the wil of God, by what meane so euer it be knowen, is to be receiued reuerently. And therefor
it is not lawful rashely to resiste the Bishop of Rome in his primacie. And this is so greate a reason
for the same, that if there were no Scripture at al, nor other reason, Yet this were inough to s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aie
the rashenes of them, that resiste. And through this onely reason, the most glorious Martyr Cyprian
in many of his Epistles vaunteth him self very boldly against al the aduersaries of Bishoppes, what
so euer they were. As in the thirde booke of the Kinges we reade, that the tenne Tribes of Israel de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
from Roboam Salomons sonne. Yet bicause it was doone by the wil or auctoritie of God, it
stoode in effecte with God. For amonge al the Diuines, the wil of the Signe, whiche they cal the
workinge of God, is to be feared no lesse, then other Signes of Goddes wil, as commandementes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitiue
&amp;c. Therefore I see not, howe they maie be excused of the gilte of schisme, whiche goinge
against this wil, withdrawe them selues from the auctoritie of the Bishop of Rome. Lo this is one
chief inuincible reason, that maketh me to be vnder the Bishop of Rome, and compelleth me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
his primacie. This farre Luther.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>I</hi> haue briefely touched some deale of the Scriptures, of the Canons and Councelles, of the
Edictes of Emperours, of the Fathers saieinges, of the reasons, and of the manifolde practises of the
Churche, whiche are wonte to be alleaged for the Popes primacie, and supreme auctoritie. VVith al,
<hi>I</hi> haue proued that, whiche <hi>M.</hi> Iuel denteth (125)<note place="margin">The .125. Vntrueth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For, Peter onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of these titles resteth yet vnproued.</note> that the Bishop of Rome Withein sixe hundred yeeres

               <p>The case goeth somewhat hardely of M. Hardinges side, when he is thus
driuen for wante of other authorities, to craue aide at Luthers hande. Touchinge
alteration in religion, whiche it pleaseth him to name lightnes, if he woulde so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly
remember his owne often chaunges, and the light occasions of the same, he
shoulde finde smal cause to condemne others. Certainely D. Luther, after God had

plough, nor refused the Grace, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God had offred him, notwithstandinge he sawe, al
the powers of the worlde were against him. His argument is taken of the effectes,
or tokens of Goddes wil. The Pope, saide he, is auanced vnto a Monarchie, or Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
state of a Kingedome: But he coulde neuer be so auanced without
Goddes wil: <hi>Ergo,</hi> it was Goddes wil, it shoulde be so.</p>

                  </hi> If it be true that M. Hardinge saith, That this is the onely sense,

and fleashely in the Sacrament, and that onlesse Christ meane so, he meaneth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge:
it is greate wonder, that none of the Ancient Catholique Doctours of the

               <p>But he saith, <hi>It is no bare Figure, as the Sacramentaries holde opinion,</hi> And therefor he
thinketh, he maie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude, that Christes Bodie is Really present. So might he also
saie, The Sacrament of Baptisme is no Bare Figure, Therfore Christ is therein

                  </hi> Yet, I trowe, M. Hardinge wil not therefore saie, Christ was
Really, or Carnally in the Rocke.</p>
               <p>Neither canne I thinke, M. Hardinge is suche a deadly enimie vnto Figures,
as he woulde nowe seeme to be. For he him selfe in these fewe woordes of Christe,
touchinge the Institution of this Holy Sacrament, as it shalbe shewed here after
more at large, is faine to seeke healpe of sixteene, or moe sundrie Figures: and
the same so strange, so grosse, and so insensible, that neither S. Augustine, nor S.
Hierome, nor any other Olde Diuine euer knewe them, nor any good Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
woulde allowe them. So many, and suche figures, it is lawful for him to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise,

it maie not be lawful, to vse one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uerily, the Olde Catholique Fathers were neuer so curiouse in this behalf,
nor thought it suche Heresie, to expounde Christes woordes by a Figure. Briefly

Thus Spiritually, &amp; with the mouth of our Faith we eate the Bodie of Christe,
and drinke his Bloude, euen as verily, as his Bodie was Uerily broaken, and
his Bloude Uerily sheadde vpon the Crosse. And thus S. Augustine,
and S. Chrysostome, and other holy Fathers taught the people in theire
time to beleue. In deede the Breade, that we receiue with our bodily mouthes, is
an carthly thinge, and therefore a Figure: as the water in Baptisme is likewise
also a Figure: But the Bodie of Christ, that thereby is represented, and there is
offred vnto our Faith, is the thinge it selfe, and no Figure. And in respecte of the
glorie thereof, we haue no regarde vnto the Figure. Therefore S. Bernarde al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludinge
to the same, saith thus,<note place="margin">Bernard. De Coena Domini.</note>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> To conclude, three thinges herein we must consider. First, that we put a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
bitweene the Signe, and the thinge it selfe, that is signified.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, that we seeke Christ aboue in Heauen, and imagin not him to be
present bodily vpon the Earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, that the Bodie of Christ is to be eaten by Faith onely, and none
otherwise.</p>
               <p>And in this last pointe appeareth a notable difference bytweene vs, and M.
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:12563:174"/>
Hardinge.<note place="margin">Figure.</note> For wée place Christe in the harte, according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Doctrine of S. Paule:<note place="margin">Ephes. 3.</note>
M. Harding placeth him in the mouthe. Wée say, Christe is eaten onely by Faithe:
M. Hardinge saith, He is eaten with the mouthe, and teeth. But Gods name be
blessed: a greate number of godly people doeth already perceiue the vnconforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and vnsauery vanitie of this Doctrine. For they haue learned of S. Cyprian,
that Christes Blessed Bodie is <hi>Cibus mentis, non ventris: <hi>Meate for the minde, not
for the belly:</hi>
                  </hi> And they haue hearde S. Augustine say, <hi>Quid paras dentem, &amp; ven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that came from Heauen. The Bread, that I wil geue you, is my Fleashe, whiche I shal geue

he saide further vnto them,</hi> It is the Spirite, that geueth life: the Fleashe profiteth

Againe, it is but a simple gheasse, to builde Religion vpon an Errour.

               <p>He addeth further, <hi>If Christe had meante, He woulde geue them onely a Figure of his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die

and almighty power to his Disciples, thereby the rather to bringe them to beleefe of his True Bodie to
be geuen them to eate. <hi>Hoc vos scandalizat?</hi> Doth this offende you? saith he. VVhat if you see the
Sonne of man ascende, where he was before? it is the spirite that geueth life &amp;c. As though he had
saide: ye consider onely my humanitie, that seemeth weake, and fraile, neither doo you esteeme my di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine

ye may beleeue, that <hi>I</hi> geue you my very Bodie to be eaten? Thus by signifieing his diuine power,
Christe confounded their vnbeleefe, touchinge the veritie, and substance of his Bodie, that he promised

               <p>M. Hardinge wandreth stil aboute his Figures, and out of Goddes Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent

               <q>
                  <p>Christe maketh mention of his Ascension into Heauen:
<lb/>
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> His Bodie is Really in the Sacrament.</p>
               </q>
               <p>He hath no iust cause to be offended, for that I lay his Logique thus abroade. It
behooueth the Reader to sée, by what force eche thinge is prooued. Uerily, if he
Conclude not thus, he renneth at riotte, and Concludeth nothinge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As touchinge Christes Ascension into Heauen, S. Augustine, &amp; other Ancient
Fathers séeme to vse the same, to prooue, That there is no such grosse presence in
the Sacrament.</hi>

For they thought, he woulde geue them his Bodie: But he tolde them, that he would Ascende
into Heauen, and that whole as he was. When ye shal see the Sonne of man Ascende thither,
where he was before, then shal you see, that he geueth not his Bodie in suche sorte, as you i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine:

               <p>
                  <hi>Christes Bodie is Ascended into Heauen: Ergo, The same Bodie is Really, and Fleashely in the

mention of his Omnipotent Power, Therfore in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sacrament there must néedes

               </p>
               <p>And againe, would M. Harding make al the worlde beléeue, if Christes Body
be not fleashly, and grossely in the Sacrament, according to his fantasie, that then
God therefore is not Omnipotent? Uerily, the olde Catholique Fathers acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege

                  </hi> It appeareth by these authorities, that Christe in the Water of Baptisme

<hi>Then,</hi> saithe he, <hi>maie we saie, that Christe is in the Sacrament Really, &amp;c.</hi> In deede a man maie
saie muche, that hath no regarde, what he say. But if he wil saie, as the Olde Godly
Fathers saide,<note place="margin">Tertull. contra Marcio. li. 4.</note> then muste he saie, <hi>Hoc est corpus meum: hoc est, Figura Corporis mei.
<hi>This is my Bodie: that is to saie, a Figure of my Bodie:</hi>
                  </hi> For so the Olde learned Father
Tertullian saithe. Then must he saie, <hi>Christus Corporis sui Figuram Discipulis suis
commendauit,<note place="margin">Augustiin. in Psalm. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>Christe deliuered vnto his Disciples a Figure of his Bodie:</hi>
                  </hi> For so the Olde
learned Father S. Augustine<note place="margin">Augustin. Ad Bonifacium E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist. 23.</note> saith: Then must he saie, <hi>Sacramentum Corporis
Christi secundum quendam modum Corpus Christi est. <hi>The Sacrament of Christes Bodie
after a certaine phrase, or manner, or Trope, or Figure of speache, is the Bodie of Christ:</hi>
                  </hi> For
so againe S. Augustine saith.</p>
               <p>Here M. Hardinge seeinge the inconueniences, and absurdities of his Doctrine,
thought good to heale it vp with some plaister. By these woordes, <hi>Really, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
&amp;c. <hi>The Godly learned Fathers,</hi>
                  </hi> saithe he, <hi>Meante that Christes very Bodie, and Fleshe is
there, but not in any Natural, or Carnal wise.</hi> And thus M. Hardinges Doctours wrote
one thinge, and meante an other. For M. Hardinge knoweth, that al Aduerbes,
taken of Nownes, signifie euermore a qualitie, and neuer the Substance: whiche
thinge Children are taught to knowe in the Grammar Schoole: and may be resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
thus, <hi>Viriliter, virili modo: muliebriter, muliebri modo.</hi> And therefore his very
Canonistes saie in their manner of Eloquence, <hi>Deus non est remunerator Nominu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
sed Aduerbiorum. <hi>God rewardeth not Nownes, but Aduerbes:</hi>
                  </hi> That is to say, God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeth
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:12563:178"/>
not the Dooinge of any thinge, but the Manner of the Dooinge. But M.
Hardinge thinketh he may take vpon him to ouerlooke, and to maister the Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar
Rules. For onlesse we make Nownes, Aduerbes: and Aduerbes, Nownes:
these mens Diuinitie cannot stande. Therefore, as they haue diuised a newe Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie:
so must our Children learne for their pleasure a Newe Grammar.</p>
               <p>But what are these Olde Learned Fathers, that saie, Christes Bodie is thus
Really, and Fleashly in the Sacrament? Where be their Woordes? What be their
Names? If they haue neither Names, nor Woordes, howe can they be allowed for
sufficient witnesses? M. Hardinge wel knoweth, that the Olde learned Fathers
neuer saide so: yet must he needes imagine bothe causes, that moued them so to say:
and also Expositions, what they meante by so saieinge. So Montanus the blinde
Senatour, beinge at supper with the Emperour Tiberius, highely commended the
great Mullet, that, he hearde saie, was set on the table before them: and shewed,
how rounde, how faire, how fatte it was: how it filled the Charger, and howe it
laie: and euermore turned his face, and pointed with his finger, to the higher ende
of the table: and yet was not the Mullet there, but farre beneath at the lower ende.
Reason woulde, that M. Hardinge had firste beene sure of the Effecte, before he had
thus gonne aboute to gheasse the causes.</p>

But what priuie mysterie is this? As I saide before, haue M. Hardinges Doctours

thinges, the one Visible, the other Inuisible: that is to saie, the Sacrament, and the mater, or
Substance of the Sacramente. Whiche Substance notwithstandinge, that is to saye, the Bodie
of Christe, if it were before our eyes, it shoulde be Visible. But beinge taken vp into Heauen,
and sittinge at the Right hande of the Father, vntil al thinges be restoared, accordinge to the
woordes of the Apostle S. Peter,<note place="margin">Acta Apost. c. 3. Augustin. De Con. Dist. 2. Qui Manducas.</note> it cannot be called thence. Therefore S. Augustine saythe,
When Christe is eaten, life is eaten: and when we eate him, we make no partes of him. And
againe S. Augustine saith, <hi>Sacramentum est sacrum signum:</hi> A Sacrament is a holy token.</p>
               <p>And what this woorde, Signum, meaneth, he declareth in his booke <hi>De doctrina Christiana.
Signum est res,<note place="margin">Augustin. De Doctrina Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiana.</note> praeter speciem, quam ingerit sensibus, aliud quiddam faciens in cogitatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem

some likenes of the thinges,<note place="margin">Augustin. ad Eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifaci. Epist. 23.</note> whereof they be Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, then were they no Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes at al.
And againe, Sacramentes be Visible Signes of heauenly thinges: but the thinges them selues

so to be taken, at it is in other vses. <hi>This is the iudgement of Berengarius, agreeinge
throughly with the woordes, and sense of the Holy Fathers: and confirmed, and
auouched by the same.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now let vs see the Confutation hereof. In a Councel holden at Rome vnder Pope
Nicolas the. 2. Berengarius was forced to recante in this wise,<note place="margin">De Consec. Dist. 2. Ego Berenga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius.</note> 
                  <hi>Credo Corpus

frangi, &amp; fidelium dentibus atteri. <hi>I beleue, that the Bodie of our Lorde Iesus Christe sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
and in very deede, is touched with the handes of the Priestes, and broaken, and rente, and
grounde with the teethe of the Faithful.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">This is an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie.</note> This was the consente, and iudgement of
that Councel. And what thinketh M. Hardinge of the same? Certainely the very
rude Glose findeth faulte herewithal, and geueth this warninge thereof vnto the
Reader, <hi>Nisi sanè intelligas verba Berengarij &amp;c. <hi>Onlesse yowe warily vnderstande these
woordes of Berengarius, you wil fal into a greater Heresie, then euer he healde any.</hi>

                     </gap>losa. ibidem.</note> Thus
these Fathers by theire owne frendes Confession, redresse the lesse erroure by the
greater: and in plaine woordes, in General Councel, by solemne waie of Recanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
professe a greater Heresie, then, by their owne iudgement, euer was defended
by Berengarius.</p>
               <p>Further, if this be in deede the Catholique Faith, as M. Hardinge woulde
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:12563:179"/>
so faine haue al the worlde to beleeue, and Bertramus, and Iohannes Scotus,
bothe very famouse, and greate learned men, wrote openly against it, with the
good contentation of the worlde, and without the apparent controlment of any
man, two hundred yéeres, or more before Berengarius was borne: let him better
aduise him selfe, whether these woordes were truely, or boldely, or rashely, or
wisely, with such affiance vttered, and auouched of his side, <hi>That this his Faithe was
neuer impugned by any man before the time of Berengarius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, that M. Hardinge calleth the Catholique Faithe, is in déede a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
Erroure, the contrary whereof hath euermore béene taught, and defended by
al the olde learned Catholique Fathers, as maye wel appéere, by that is already,
and hereafter shalbe alleged of their writinges. Certainely, they, that nowe
condemne Berengarius for vsinge the plaine woords, and Expositions of the Olde
Fathers, woulde as wel condemne S. Augustine, S. Hierome, S. Ambrose, and
the reaste, were it not for the Credite, and Authoritie of their Names.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Doctours, that haue beene sithence the time of Berengarius,</hi> (saithe M. Hardinge) <hi>haue
more often vsed these termes, <hi>Really, Carnally, &amp;c.</hi> then other Olde Doctours within sixe hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
yeeres after Christe.</hi> In these fewe woordes, M. Hardinge hath handsomely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueied
in a greate vntrueth. For this Comparatiue <hi>(More often)</hi> presupposeth the
Positiue. Therefore the sense hereof must be this, The Olde Doctours often vsed
these Termes, Really, Fleashly, &amp;c. albeit not so often, as others of the later yée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res.
But. M. Hardinge knoweth, this is vntrue. For neither hath he here yet she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed,
nor is he hable to shewe, that in this case of the Sacrament, any of these
termes was euer vsed by any one of al the Olde Ancient writers. Wherof we may
wel reason thus, The Olde Catholique Fathers intreatinge of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Substance of the
Sacrament, neuer vsed any of these woordes, Really, Carnally, &amp;c. Therefore it
is likely, they neuer taught the people to beleue, that Christes Bodie is presente
Really, and Fleashely in the Sacrament. Contrarywise, they in their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
called the Sacrament a Figure, a Signe, a Remembrance of Christes Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die:
therefore it is likely, they woulde haue the Catholique people so to iudge, and
beléeue of the Sacrament.</p>

               <p>Here, before that <hi>I</hi> bringe in places of auncient Fathers, reportinge the same Doctrine, and in
like termes, as the Catholike Churche dooth holde, concerninge this Article: least our opinion herein
might happily appeare our Carnal, and Grosse: <hi>I</hi> thinke it necessarie briefely to declare, what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
a true Bodie, and Bloude is in the Sacrament. Christe in him selfe, hathe but one Fleashe, and Bloud
in Substance, whiche his Godhead tooke of the Virgin Marie once, and neuer afterwarde leafte it of.
But this one Fleashe, and Bloude in respecte of double qualitie, hathe a doubleconsideration. For at
what time Christe liued here in earthe amonge men in the shape of man, his fleashe was thralle, and
subiecte to the frailtie of mannes nature, sinne, and ignoraunce excepted. That fleashe beinge passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
vnto deathe, the souldiours at the procurement of the Iewes crucified. And suche manner Bloude
was at his passion sheadde foorthe of his Bodie, in sight of them, whiche were then present. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that Christe rose againe from the deade, his Bodie from that time forwarde euer remainethe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal,
and liuely, in daunger no more of any infirmitie, or sufferinge, muche lesse of deathe: but is
become by diuine giftes and endowementes, a spiritual, and a diuine Bodie, as to whom the Godhead
bathe communicated Diuine, and Godly properties, and excellencies, that beene aboue al mannes ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie
of vnderstandinge. This Fleashe, and Bodie thus considered, whiche sundrie Doctours calle
<hi>Corpus Spirituale, &amp; Deificatu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> A Spiritual, and a Deified Bodie, is geuen to vs in the blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.
This is the doctrine of the Churche, vttered by S. Hierome in his Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mentaries vpon the Epistle
to the Ephesians:<note place="margin">Lib. 1. Cap. 1.</note> where he hath these woords, <hi>Dupliciter verò Sanguis &amp; Caro intelligitur, vel
Spiritualis illa atque Diuina, de qua ipse dixit, Caro mea verè est cibus, &amp; Sanguis meus
verè est porus: Et, Nisi manducaueritis Carnem meam, &amp; Sanguinem meu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> biberitis, non
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:12563:179"/>
habebitis vitam aeternam: Vel Caro, quae Crucifixa est, &amp; Sanguis, qui militis effusus est
lancea.</hi> That is, The Bloude, and Fleashe of Christ is vnderstanded two waies: either that it is that
spiritual, and diuine Fleashe, of whiche he spake him self, My Fleashe is verily meate, and my Bloude
is verily drinke: and, Excepte ye eate my Fleashe, and drinke my Bloude, ye shal not haue life in you:
Or, that Fleashe, whiche was crucified, and that Bloude, whiche was sheadde by pearcinge of the
souldiers speare. And to the intent a man sholde not take this difference accordinge to the substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
of Christe Fleashe and Bloude, but accordinge to the qualitie onely, <hi>S.</hi> Hierome bringeth a simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of our Fleashe, as of whiche it hath ben in double respecte saide:<note place="margin">Luc. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  <hi>Iuxta hanc diuisionem, &amp;
in Sanctis etiam diuersitas Sanguinis, &amp; Carnis accipitur: vt alia sit Caro, quae visura est
salutare Dei, alia Caro, &amp; Sanguis, quae Regnum Dei non queant possidere.</hi> Accordinge
to this diuision, diuersitie of Bloude, and Fleashe is to be vnderstanded in Sainctes also, so as there is
one Fleashe, whiche shal see the Saluation of God, and an other Fleashe, and Bloude, which maie
not possesse the Kingedome of God. VVhiche two states of Fleashe, and Bloude seeme (as it appeareth
to the vnlearned) quite contrary.</p>
               <p>But <hi>S.</hi> Paule dissolueth this doubte, in the fiftenth Chapter of his first Epistle to the Corinthians,
saieinge, that Fleashe of suche sorte, as we beare aboute vs in this life, earthly, mortal, fraile, and
bourthenous to the soule, cannot possesse the Kingdome of God, because corruption shal not possesse
incorruption. But after Resurrection, we shal haue a spiritual, gloriouse, incorruptible, and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Fleashe, and like in figure to the gloriouse Bodie of Christ, as <hi>S.</hi> Paule saith: This corruptible Bodie
must put on incorruption: and this mortal, immortalitie. Then suche Fleashe, or our Fleashe of that
manner and sorte, shal possesse the Kingdome of God, and shal beholde God him self. And yet our
Fleashe nowe corruptible, and then incorruptible, is but one Fleashe in substance, but diuerse in
qualitie and propertie. Euen so it is to be thought of our Lordes Fleashe, as is afore saide. The dewe
weighinge of this difference geueth muche light to this matter, and ought to staie many horrible
blasphemies wickedly vtered against this most blessed Sacrament.</p>

of either Nature. And therefore the Fathers saie, Christes Bodie is Deified.
or made God, for that it is vnited in persone, and Glorie with the Nature of God.
To this purpose,<note place="margin">Augustine. in Psalm. 49. Dionysius De Eccle. Hierar. cap. 1.</note> although not altogeather in like sense, S. Augustine seemeth to

And is thought to make muche for M. Hardinge. For answeare hereunto, firste of
al, this one thinge I praie thée, good Reader, to consider, that S. Hierome in that
whole place speaketh not one woorde, neither of the Sacrament, nor of any Real,
or Fleashly Presence. Therefore M. Hardinge can haue but very poore healpe
hereof, to prooue his purpose. Onely he expoundeth, what S. Paule meante by
these woordes,<note place="margin">Ad Ephesi. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>VVe haue Redemption by his Bloude:</hi> And his meaninge, as it appeareth
by the whole drifte of his woordes, is this, That the Saluation, which we haue in
Christe, standeth not in that, he was a méere natural man, as were <hi>Codrus, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius,
Curtius,</hi> or suche others, that died for the safetie and deliuerie of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries:
but in that his Humanitie was vnited, and ioyned in one persone with the
Nature of God.<note place="margin">Hieronym. ad Ephes. ca. 1.</note> His woordes be these, <hi>Quis iste, aiunt, tantus, ac talis, qui possit pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio
suo Totum Orbem redimere? Iesus Christus Filius Dei proprium Sanguinem dedit,
&amp; nos de Seruitute eripiens libertate donauit. Et re vera, si historijs Gentilium credimus,
quòd Codrus, &amp; Curtius, &amp; Decij Mures pestilentias vrbium, &amp; fames, &amp; bella suis mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus
represserint: quantò magis hoc in Dei Filio possible iudicandum est, quòd cruore
suo, non Vrbem vna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> purgauerit, sed Totum Orbem? <hi>They say, What was he, suche a one,
and so mighty, that by his price was hable to redeeme the whole world? Iesus Christ the Sonne
of God gaue his owne Bloude, and deliueringe vs from bondage, hath made vs free. And in
deede, if we beleeue the Heathen stories, that Codrus, Curtius, and Decii Mures remoued
Pestilences, Famines, and warres from their Citties by their deathe: howe muche more may we
iudge the same possible in the Sonne of God, that he by his Bloude hath purged, not onely one
Cittie, but also the whole worlde?</hi>
                  </hi> Immediatly after this folowe the woordes that M.
Hardinge hath here alleged: <hi>Dupliciter verò, &amp;c. <hi>For the Bloude, and Fleashe of Christe
hath double vnderstandinge.</hi>
                  </hi> By the whole course of these woordes thus gooinge before,
it is easy to perceiue S. Hieromes meaninge: that is, That we haue our Salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in Christe, and doo Eate him, and Drinke him, and liue by him, not for that
his Fleashe was mortal onely, and Crucified vpon the Crosse: but for that it was
Spiritual, and Diuine, that is to saye, the Fleashe of the Sonne of God. And
herein stoode that greate contention, that Cyrillus, and other Godly Fathers had
against Nestorius: as it is wel knowen vnto the learned. And therefore S.
Paule saithe,<note place="margin">Galat. 2.</note> That I liue nowe in the Fleashe, I liue in the Faithe of the Sonne
of God.</p>
               <p>Therefore notwithstandinge S. Augustine say,<note place="margin">Augustin. in Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han. tractat. 88.</note> 
                  <hi>Christus Crucifixus est Lac su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentibus,
&amp; Cibus proficientibus: <hi>Christe Crucified is Milke vnto the sucklinges, and
harder meate vnto the stronge:</hi>
                  </hi>
                  <note place="margin">Angelomus in. 1. Regum. ca. 1.</note> And notwithstandinge Angelomus saye, <hi>Christes Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
is haye, whereby the Gentiles are feadde,</hi> Yet muste bothe these, and also al other
like places be taken, not of bare mortal Fleashe alone, but of the Fleashe of the
Sonne of God: whiche S. Hierome calleth Diuine, &amp; Spiritual, for that it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally,
and inseparably ioyned with the Godheade.</p>
               <p>Againe, S. Hieromes meaninge is, that the same Fleashe of Christe, beinge
thus Diuine, and Spiritual, muste also Spiritually be receiued, and not in any
suche Carnal, or Fleashly wise, as is here imagined by M. Hardinge. For
notwithstandinge Christes Bodie be Spiritual, yet is that no sufficient war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
to prooue, that therefore M. Hardinges opinion is not, as he saithe, ouer
Grosse, and Carnal. For the Manichées, and the Messalian Heretiques had
Grosse, and Carnal imaginations of God him selfe, notwithstandinge God be
onely Sprite, and moste Spiritual. And therefore S. Augustine saith of them,
<hi>Ecce ego derideo Carnales homines,<note place="margin">Augusti. contrae Epistolam Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damenti. cap. 23.</note> qui nondum possunt Spiritualia cogitare: <hi>Beholde,
I laughe to scorne these Carnal, and Fleashly men, that are not yet hable to conceiue thinges
Spiritual.</hi>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="333" facs="tcp:12563:181"/>
For proufe hereof S. Hierome him selfe saithe,<note place="margin">De Cons. Dis. 2. De hac.</note> 
                  <hi>De hac quidem Hoftia, quae in
Christi Commemoratione mirabiliter fit, edere licet: De illa verò, quam Christus in Ara
Crucis obtulit, secundum se nulli edere licet: <hi>Of this Oblation, which is marueilously made
in the remembrance of Christe, it is lawful to eate: But of that Oblation, whiche Christe offered
vpon the Aultar of the Crosse, accordinge to it selfe</hi>
                  </hi> (that is to saie, in Grosse, &amp; Fleashly
manner) <hi>it is lawful for noman to eate.</hi> By these woordes S. Hierome also sheweth
a greate difference bitweene the Sacrifice, that is made in the Remembrance of
Christe, and the very Sacrifice in déede, that Christe made vpon the Crosse. So
S. Chrysostome saith,<note place="margin">Chrysostom. in Iohan. hom. 47.</note> 
                  <hi>Si Carnaliter quis accipiat, nihil lucratur: <hi>If a man take it Fleash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
he gaineth nothinge.</hi>
                  </hi> So likewise S. Augustine saithe,<note place="margin">Augustin. de Doctrina Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiana. li. 3. ca. 16. Clemens Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drin. in Paeda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogo lib. 2. ca. 2.</note> as it is alleged before, <hi>It
is a Figure, or Forme of speache, willinge vs to be pertakers of Christes Passion, and conforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
to remember, that Christe hath died for vs.</hi> This S. Hierome calleth the Eatinge of
the Diuine, and Spiritual Fleashe of Christe. Therefore Clemens Alexandrinus
saithe, not onely in like sense, but also in like forme of woordes, <hi>Duplex est Sanguis
Domini: alter Carnalis, quo redempti sumus: alter Spiritualis, quo vncti sumus. Er hoc
est Bibere Iesu Sanguinem, participem esse incorruptionis Domini: <hi>There are twoo sortes
of Christes Bloud: the one Fleashly, where with wee are redeemed: the other Spiritual, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
wee are annointed. And this is the drinkinge of the Bloude of Christe, to be partaker
of his Immortalitie.</hi>
                  </hi>
                  <note place="margin">Augusti. Contra liter. Petilian. lib. 2. cap. 8.</note> In like sorte S. Augustine saithe, <hi>Iudas Christum Carnalem tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didit,
tu Spiritualem: Furens Euangelium Sanctum flammis Sacrilegis tradidisti: <hi>Iudas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traied
Christe Carnal: but thou hast betraied Christe Spiritual. For in thy furie thou betraiedst
the Holy Gospel, to be burnt in wicked fiere.</hi>
                  </hi> Here S. Augustine calleth Christe Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
for that the manner of the betraieing was Spiritual. Likewise that Ancient
Father Clemens calleth Christes Bloud Spiritual, not in respecte of difference in
it selfe, but onely in respecte of the Spiritual receiuing. And I thinke, M. Harding
wil not denie, but these woordes of Clemens, &amp; Augustine agréeing so neare bothe
in sense, &amp; phrase, with the woordes of Hierome, may stande for sufficient exposition
to the same. Certainely, as Christes Bloude is not Really, or Bloudily Present to
annoynte vs, so is it not Really, or Bloudily Present to nourishe vs. For this
Nourishinge, and this Annointinge are bothe Spiritual. And therefore the Olde
learned Father Athanasius writeth thus:<note place="margin">Athanasius de Peccato in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritum Sanctum.</note>

demaunded, how one Bodie of one man might suffice the whole worlde: whiche thinge, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge

(of grosse and fleashely eatinge) <hi>as he before made mention of his comming downe

               </p>
               <p>To conclude, once againe, gentle Reader, I must doo thee to remember, that
S. Hierome in this whole place neuer spake one woorde, neither of any Real, or
Fleashely Presence, nor of the Sacrament. Yet notwithstandinge, M. Hardinge, as
though S. Hierome had plainely, and vndoubtedly spoken of bothe, hereof geathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
his reason thus: <hi>S. Hierome saithe, Wee eate not the Fleashe of Christe, that was
Crucified: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Christes Fleashe is Really, and Fleashly in the Sacrament.</hi> This Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
is euident to the eie, and néedeth no answeare.</p>
               <p>His Reason woulde better haue framed thus: S. Hierome saithe, <hi>VVee can
not eate the Fleashe of Christe, that was Crucified: <hi>Ergo,</hi> VVee cannot Really, and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
eate the Fleashe of Christe.</hi> Whereof it muste necessarily folow, euen by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie,
that M. Hardinge hath here alleged, that Christes Bodie is not Really,
and Fleashly in the Sacramente. Suche reliefe hath M. Hardinge founde in these
woordes of S. Hierome.</p>

               <p>Here M. Harding once againe, as before, wil teache vs, what the olde Fathers
meante by those woordes, that they neuer vttred. I trowe, he hath some priuie Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uination,
that thus taketh vpon him, to know what men meane, before they

the aforesaide termes, to put away al doubte of the beinge of Christes very Bodie in these holy Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</hi>
Uerily, this is a merueilous boldenesse, so often, and with suche confidence,
and countenance to say, The Olde Fathers vsed these termes, and yet not once to

this vaine muster of the names of Chrysostome, Hilarie, Gregorie Nyssene, and

               <p>
                  <hi>The Sacramentaries</hi> (saith M. Hardinge) <hi>vtter their Doctrine by these termes, Figure, Signe,
Token, Signification, and Vertue.</hi> I may not answeare this discourtesie of talke with
like discourtesie. Onely I wil say of these men,<note place="margin">August. contra Sermon. Ariano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum. Ca. 36.</note> as S. Augustine sometime saide
of the Arians. <hi>Cum se tanta voragine impietatis immergant, nos, tanquam opprobrio

                  </hi> But if they be al Sacramentaries, that vse these termes,
then must S. Augustine, S. Hierome, S. Chrysostome, S. Ambrose, and al other
the holy Fathers, that vsed the same, néedes be condemned for Sacramentaries.
But if they be Sacramentaries, that shamefully abuse, and corrupte the holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes,
then may M. Hardinge, and his frendes rightly be called Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries.
M. Harding addeth, <hi>Chrysostome saith, In Visible signes, thinges Inuisible be deliuered:
<hi>Ergo,</hi> The Bodie of Christe is Really, and Fleashely in the Sacrament.</hi> First, if M. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge
had wel considered that whole Homilie, happily he woulde haue charged

<pb n="335" facs="tcp:12563:182"/>
For,<note place="margin">Chrysostom. in Matthae. hom. 83.</note> touchinge the Sacrament, Chrysostome euen there writeth thus, <hi>Quando di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunt,

                  </gap>weth, that Chrysostome speaketh not these
woordes onely of the Sacrament of Christes Bodie, but also generally of al other
Mysteries. For he addeth immediatly, <hi>Sic &amp; in Baptismo, per Aquam, quae res Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibilis

compare voices, they of Wittenberge were moe in number: If knowledge, they

his Woorde, as it appeareth this daie. His holy name be praised therefore for euer.
But these Eight piked Cardinalles, after greate studie, and longe debatinge of the

                  </hi> The argument, that M. Hardinge

his Bodie is Really, and Fleashly in the Sacrament.</hi> This Conclusion is but childishe:
Yet if he conclude not thus, he concludeth nothinge.</p>
               <p>The greatest weight of this mater lieth vpon two Olde Fathers, Cyril, and

And for answeare of the same, once againe remember, good Christian
Reader, that notwithstandinge M. Hardinge haue founde in these two Fathers,
that Christes Bodie is Corporally, and Naturally in vs, yet hath he not hitherto

Thus, notwithstanding Christe were in Heauen, and distant in place, yet was he
present in S. Paule: for so S. Paule him selfe saith, <hi>Wil ye haue a trial of Christ, that
speaketh within me?</hi> This Coniunction is Spiritual, and therefore néedeth not, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Circumstance of Place,<note place="margin">Cyprian. De Coena Domini.</note> nor Corporal Presence. Likewise S. Cyprian saithe,

&amp; confoederat voluntates. <hi>The Coniunction, that is bitweene Christe and vs, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doo the mingle Persons, nor vnite Substances: but it dooth knitte our affectes togeather,
and ioyne our willes.</hi>
                  </hi> Yet notwithstanding, the same Coniunction, bicause it is Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual,
true, ful, and perfite, therefore is expressed of these Holy Fathers by this
terme, Corporal: whiche remooueth al manner light, and Accidental ioininge:
and Natural, whereby al manner Imagination, or Fantasie, and Coniunction
onely of Wil, and Consent is excluded: not that Christes Bodie is Corporally, or
Naturally in our Bodie, as is before saide: no more then our Bodies are Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
or Naturally in Christes Bodie: but that wée haue Lyfe in vs, &amp; are become
Immortal, bicause by Faith, and Sprite, wée are partakers of the Natural Bodie
of Christe. M. Hardinge saith, Wée are thus ioined vnto Christe, and haue him
Corporally within vs, onely by receiuing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Sacrament, &amp; by none other meanes.
This is vtterly vntrue, as it is already prooued, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Authorities of S. Augustine

Diuine Nature: and the Authours, and Mainteiners of the same, leauinge reason,
accordinge to M. Hardinges counsel, and cleauinge wholy to their imagination,
whiche they called Faith, were farre deceiued.</p>
               <p>But M. Hardinge laieth the fundation hereof vpon a Miracle: whereof not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstandinge,
touchinge this grosse, and fleashely Presence, he hath no manner
warrant, neither in the Scriptures, nor in any of the Holy Fathers. As for that,
is alleged of Chrysostome, and Basile, it is to a farre other purpose, as shal appeare,
and maie soone be answeared. S. Augustine wrote three special Bookes,<note place="margin">Augustin. de Mirabilibus Sacrae Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the Miracles of the Olde, and Newe Testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: and Gregorie Nazianzene wrote
in like sorte of the same: yet did neither of them both euer make mention of this
Miracle. And albeit this kinde of reasoninge, <hi>Ab authoritate negatiuè,</hi> in suche
cases implie no greate necessitie, yet must it needes be thought either greate negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
or greate forgeatfulnes, writinge purposely, and namely of Miracles, to
leaue out vntouched the greatest Miracle. Certainely, S. Augustine hereof wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
thus:<note place="margin">Augustin. de Trinit. li. 3. c. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Quia haec hominibus nota sunt, quia per homines fiunt, honorem, tanquam re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiosa,
habere possunt: stuporem, tanquam mira, non possunt. <hi>These thinges,</hi>

are wrought, maie haue honoure, as thinges appointed to Religion: but woonder, as thinges
marueilous, they cannot haue.</hi> Thus S. Augustine ouerthroweth M. Hardinges whole
fundation: and saith, that in his great Miracle, there is no woonder, or Miracle at al.</p>
               <p>He saith further, <hi>It is agreeable to the Godheade, to be euery where, <hi>Simpliciter,</hi> and
<hi>Propriè:</hi> For a creature, it is agreeable to be in one place. But as for the Bodie of Christe,</hi>
he saithe, <hi>it is after a manner bitweene bothe.</hi> This is the whole countenance of
this mater. And this whole place M. Hardinge hath borowed euen woorde by
woorde out of Gerson.<note place="margin">Gerson contra Floretum.</note> But where as he addeth, That the Bodie of Christe, as it
is vnited vnto the Godheade, maie be at one time in sundrie places, he shoulde haue
remembred, that this is an olde erroure, longe sithence reproued, and condemned
by S. Augustine,<note place="margin">Augustinus ad Dardanum. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis. 57.</note> and other learned Fathers. S. Augustine saith thus: <hi>Cauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum

doo not so mainteine the Diuine Nature of Christ beinge man, that we take awaie the Trueth

                  </hi> S. Augustines wordes be plaine, that who so saith, The Bodie of Christe

S. Augustine knoweth a Creator, and a Creature: but M. Hardinges meane by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene

inseparabiles, &amp; in sua semper proprietate manentes. <hi>We confesse, there are in Christe
two Substances, or Natures: The one, of the Godhead, the other, of the Manheade: The one of
the Creator, the other of the Creature: Which Substances notwithandinge, are not Confused,
but Vnited, and in one selfe same Persone inseparable, and remaininge euer more in their owne
Properties.</hi>
                  </hi> The like writeth Leo, Cyrillus, Gelasius, and al the reast of the Olde
Learned Fathers. Therefore M. Hardinge was muche ouerseene, either to teache
the people, that Christes Bodie is neither the Creator, nor the Creature, but a
meane bitweene both: or els to saie, that the same Bodie, beinge vnited vnto the
Godheade, maie therefore be in sundrie places at one time. Herein rested the olde
Heresie of Eutyches. For thus Flauianus writeth of him:<note place="margin">Flauianus ad Leonem.</note> 
                  <hi>Corpus Domini Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manum
quidem vocat: tamen negat esse nobis Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>substantiale. <hi>He calleth the Bodie of our

                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>But M. Hardinge replieth, <hi>Christes Bodies is nowe become Immortal, and Glorious.</hi>
This is most true, and without al question. How be it, it may please him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
that, when Christe ministred the holy Communion to his Disciples, his
Bodie was then Mortal, and subiecte to Death, and other iniuries, and not Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.
Therefore if Christes Bodie in the Sacrament be Immortal, and Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
it must folowe, that, for that present, Christe had twoo manner Bodies: the
one Mortal, the other Immortal: the one Glorious, the other not Glorious. Thus
M. Hardinges Rules and Examples matche not togeather.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He addeth further,</hi> Christes Bodie walkte vpon the waters: vanisshed out of sight: ascended
through the Cloudes: and entred through the doores beinge fast shutte, &amp;c. <hi>These were the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
that deceiued the Olde Manichees. I maruel, that M. Hardinge, beinge, as
he saithe, lately become a professour of the Catholique Faithe, woulde founde the
whole substances of his Doctrine vpon Heretiques. Touching the special trust, that
the Manichees reposed in this argumente,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hieronym i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. Psalm. 119.</note> 
                  <hi>S. Hierome writeth thus: <hi>Cum dicit
Manichaeus, &amp; similis Manichaeorum, Dominus non Resurrexit in Corporis Veritate, &amp;,
vt scias, non fuisse verum Corpus, clausis ingressus est ostijs, nos quid dicemus? Domine
libera animam meam a labijs iniquis, &amp; a lingua dolosa.</hi>
                  </hi> When the Manichee, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
like the Manichees, saith, The Lorde arose not againe in the Trueth of his Bodie, and for
proufe thereof, saith thus, He entred in, when the doores were shutte, what then shal wee
say? Euen thus, O Lorde, deliuer my soule from wicked lippes, and deceiteful tongues.
<hi>Here wée sée, M. Hardinge is driuen to séeke vpon olde condemned Heretiques, and
to borow their weapons: wherefore it shalbe good to folow S. Hieromes counsel,
and to say, <hi>O</hi>
                  </hi> Lorde deliuer my soule from wicked lippes, and deceiteful tongues.</p>
               <p>Likewise S. Ambrose saithe, The Apostles of Christe,<note place="margin">Ambrosi. in Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam li. 10. ca. 24.</note> by the same manner of
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:12563:190"/>
reasoninge, were deceiued. For vpon that, Christe entred, the gates being shutte,
he writeth thus: <hi>Denique conturbati Discipuli aestimabant, se Spiritum videre. Et ideò
Dominus, vt speciem nobis Resurrectionis ostenderet, palpate, inquit, et videte, quia Spiri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tus
Carne<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; Ossa no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> habet: sicut me videtis habere. <hi>The Disciples being astonned, thought
they saw a Spirite, or a Fantasie. Therefore the Lorde, to shew a token of his Resurrection,
saide vnto them, feele, and see: for a Spirite, or Fantasie, hath not Fleashe and Bone, as you
see, that I haue.</hi>
                  </hi> Now, if these argumentes were hable to deceiue the Apostles of
Christe, it is not impossible, but they may likewise deceiue M. Hardinge. Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
saith,<note place="margin">Chrysost. in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milia De Iohan. Baptisia.</note> 
                  <hi>Clausa erant ostia, &amp; ingressus est Iesus: Non erat phantasma: Non erat
Spiritus: Verè Corpus erat: habebat Carnes, &amp; Ossa. <hi>The doores were shutte, and Iesus
entred: It was no Fantasie: it was no Sprite: it was verily a Bodie: it had Fleashe and
Boanes.</hi>
                  </hi> Thus, notwithstandinge these Marueilous effectes, yet the Ancient god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Fathers saide, Christes Bodie neuerthelesse is, and continueth stil a Creature:
not a meane bitwéene bothe: as M. Hardinge here strangely hath imagined.</p>
               <p>Now let vs consider M. Hardinges argumentes:
<q>
                     <p>Christes Bodie walkte vpon the waters:
<lb/>It entred through the doores beinge shutte:
<lb/>It ascended through the Cloudes:
<lb/>
                        <hi>Ergo,</hi> It may be at one time in sundrie places.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Although this argument may soone be espied, hauinge vtterly no manner
sequele in reason, yet the folie thereof may the better appeare by the like.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>S. Peter walkte vpon the water:<note place="margin">Matth. 14. 2. Regum. 2.</note>
Elias was taken vp into the Cloudes:
<lb/>S. Bartholomew entred through the doores being shutte:
<lb/>
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> S. Peter, Elias, and S. Bartholomew may be at one time in sundrie places.</p>
               </q>
               <p>And that I allege here of S. Bartholomew,<note place="margin">Aldias in Bartholomaeo.</note> although it be but a vaine Fable,
yet it may not easily be denied. For it is recorded by Abdias, the Bishop of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,
who, as M. Harding supposeth, saw Christe in the Fleashe, and was one of
the Apostles Felowes.</p>
               <p>Ouer al this M. Hardinge throweth a swéete myste, to carie away the simple
in the darke. <hi>Christes Bodie</hi> (saith he) <hi>is in the Sacrament, not by Local, but by Substantial pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence:
Carnally, but not in carnal manner: placed in the Pyxe, in the hande, in the mouthe: and
yet in no place at al: a very Natural Bodie, euen as it was vpon the Crosse: yet without al manner
Quantitie, and Dimensions, or Proportions of a Bodie, that is, neither thicke, nor broade, nor
shorte, nor longe: there now, where before it was not: and yet without any shiftinge, or change
of places.</hi> Onlesse this man were fast asleape, he coulde neuer fal into so deepe a
Dreame. In these Fantasies he séemeth wel to agrée with the Olde Heretiques,
Eutyches, and Manichee. For euen suche a Bodie they imagined, that Christe
receiued of the Blissed Uirgin: and yet were they Heretiques notwithstandinge.
For whiche of al the Olde learned Fathers euer taught vs this strange Doctrine?
Who euer durst to spoile Christe of his Place, of his Quantitie, and of the natural
Proportions of his Bodie? If the Doctours of the Churche say thus, why are they
not alleged? If they say not thus, why is this mater caried away with such coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of Antiquitie? Or why doothe M. Hardinge thus auouche this vnsensible

               <p>As for the difference, that he hath diuised, of Uisible, and Unuisible: Local, and

we reason not of Respectes, and Qualities: but as S. Augustine, S. Cyril, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

worketh in the Faithful, in that dreadful time of the holy Communion, wherein
the whole Mysterie of our Redemption, that we haue in the Bloude of Christe, is

sought onely to lifte vp,<note place="margin">Calat. 3.</note> and inkendle his hearers mindes. So S. Paule saith to the

<hi>Elizaeus receiued the coate made of Sheepe skinnes, as a greate inheritance. And doubtelesse
it was an inheritance more Pretious then any Golde. After that time, Elias was double.
For there was Elias abooue, and Elias beneath.</hi>
                  </hi> Abooue was the very true Elias in the
Natural Substance, and Presence of his Bodie: Beneathe was nothinge elles,
but Elias coate: whiche coate notwithstandinge, bicause of the powers, that were
wrought with it, he calleth Elias. Thus Chrysostome compareth Elias with
Christe, and Elias coate with the Sacrament: And thus he saith, Christe is aboue,
and Christe is beneathe: as he saithe, Elias is aboue, and Elias is beneathe. For
as Elias coate was called Elias, euen so the Sacrament of Christes Bodie, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Christes Bodie. Whiche saieinge agréeth wel with these woordes of S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine:

letter, as I saide before of S. Chrysostome, he wil make S. Ambrose in one sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
plaine contrary to him selfe. For first he saith, <hi>Vidimus Principe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Sacerdotu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp;c.
<hi>We haue seene (Christe) the Prince of Priestes comming vnto vs: we haue seene him, and hearde

                  </hi> If wée folow
the very force, and sounde of the woordes, this Contradiction of séeing, and not see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge
can not be salued. Wherfore, to auoyde this inconuenience, wée must say, that
S. Ambrose speaketh of the Spiritual eies of our Faith, with whiche eyes wée sée
Christe in déede offeringe vp him selfe vpon the Crosse. And thus,<note place="margin">De ijs qui initi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antur Mysterijs ca. 3.</note> as S. Ambrose
saith, <hi>Magis videtur, quod non videtur: <hi>The thinge is the better seene, that is not seene.</hi>
                  </hi>
It is best seene with our Faithe, that is least séene with our Bodie. For our Faith
is sharper, then our eie. And in like sense S. Augustine saithe,<note place="margin">Augustin. Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. 119. De tempore.</note>

sithe it is offered in many places, be there many Christes? Not so, but there is but one Christe
euerywhere, beinge bothe here fully, and there fully also, one Bodie. For as he, that is offered eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rywhere,
is but one Bodie, and not many Bodies, so likewise it is but one Sacrifice. By this place
of Chrysostome we see, what hath beene the Faithe of the Olde Fathers touchinge this Article: euen
the same, whiche the Catholike Churche professeth at these daies, that one Christe is offered in many
places, so as he be fully, and perfitely here, and fully, and perfitely there. And thus we perceiue,
what force their argumentes haue in the iudgement of the learned Fathers, by whiche they take away
from Christe power to make his Bodie present in many places at once. S. Bernarde vttereth the Faith
of the Churche in his time agreeable with this, in these woordes:<note place="margin">Sermo. in Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Domini.</note> 
                  <hi>Sed vnde hoc nobis pijssime

Soothely, not of our dutie, or deserte, but of thy good wil, and of the good pleasure of thy Sweetnes.
for thou hast prepared in thy sweetenes for the poore one, O God. In the same Sermon exhortinge the
Churche to reioyce of the presence of Christe, he saithe, <hi>In terra Sponsum habes in Sacramento,
in coelis habitura es sine velamento: &amp; hîc, &amp; ibi veritas: sed hîc palliata, ibi manifestata.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Christe vvhole here, and vvhole there.</note> We offer in deede: but we doo it in Remembrance of his Death.
This sacrifice is an Examplar, or Figure of that Sacrifice. The thinge, that we doo, is donne
in Remembrance of that thinge, that was donne before. For Christe saieth, Doo this in my
Remembrance. We offer vp the same thinge: Naye, rather we woorke the Remembrance
of a Sacrifice. <hi>By thus many sundrie waies, Chrysostome opened his owne mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge.
Yet al this M. Hardinge thought best to dissemble closely, and to passe it in
silence. Certainely, the Commemoration, or Figure, or Remembrance of Christes
Death, maketh smal proufe for Corporal, or Fleashly Presence. True it is, that
whole Christe is fully at euery Communion, as Chrysostome saithe: not, that he is
there in Fleashely, or Bodily Presence, For so S. Chrysostome saithe not: but for
that by his Grace, &amp; holy Sprite, he woorketh wholy, and effectually in the hartes
of the Faithful. S. Augustine, and other learned Fathers, haue vsed the like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of speache, and in the same seeme fully to expresse Chrysostomes minde. S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine
writeth thus, <hi>Veritas vna est, qua illustrantur animae Sanctae:<note place="margin">Augustin. in Psalm. 11.</note> Sed quoniam mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae

But, for as muche as, the Soules be many, it may be saide, that in the same are many Truethes:

                  </hi> The Wisedome of God, the Woorde of God, our Lorde Iesus Christe is euerywhere
Present: for the Trueth is euerywhere, and Wisedome is euerywhere. One Man vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth
Righteousenes in the East: an other vnderstandeth Righteousnes in the Weast. And
dooth the one of them vnderstande one Righteousnes, and the other, an other? <hi>So likewise,
and somewhat neare to the manner of Chrysostomes speache, Origen speaketh,
<hi>Et hodiè in hac Congregatione Dominus loquitur:<note place="margin">Origen. in Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam homi. 32.</note> &amp; non solùm in hac, sed etiam in alio

in this Congregation the Lorde speaketh: and not onely in this, but also in an other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie,
and in the whole worlde Iesus teacheth, seekinge instrumentes, by whiche he may teache.
<hi>In this sorte is Christe Present at the holy Ministration, bicause his Truthe, his
Wisedome, his Righteousnes, his Woorde is there Present, as the face is Present
in the Glasse: not by any Bodily, or Fleashely Presence. In this manner S. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose
writeth: <hi>Coelum aspice: Iesus illic est. Terram intuere:<note place="margin">Ambros. in Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam li. 2 ca. 1.</note> Iesus adest. Si Ascenderis
in Coelum, Iesus illic est: si descenderis ad Infernum, adest. Hodie, cum loquor, mecum

                  </hi> Looke vp

Iesus is with me: euen at this Houre, euen at this Minute. And, if any Christian man speake now
in Armenia, so farre hence, Iesus is with him. For no man saith, The Lorde Iesus, but in the
Holy Ghost. <hi>And suche kinde of Presence at one time in sundrie places, is auouched
by S. Chrysostome, not onely of Christes Bodie, whiche is Immortal, &amp; Glorious,
but also of any other godly Mortal Man. For thus he writeth:<note place="margin">Chrysost. ad po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulum Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chen. homil. 51.</note>

Finite: <hi>Ergo,</hi> It is in places Infinite. Christe hath two sortes of Bodies: One onely Local:
al the reast of the other sorte not Local. It is in place: yet it occupieth, or filleth no place.
It is a very Natural Mans Bodie:<note place="margin">Thomas in .3. quae. 76. ar. 30.</note> yet is it neither rounde, nor square, nor thicke, nor broade,
nor shorte, nor longe. It hath in it no distance, or difference of partes: as bytweene eye and eye:
or eye, and eare: or heade, and foote: but Eye, Eare, Arme, Hande, Heele, Toe, Heade, and
Foote are al togeather, and eche is other, and al is one. In tenne thousande seueral places
Christes Bodie is ful, and whole: and yet al these are but one Bodie. <hi>Thus One is Many,
and Many are One: Aboue is Beneath, &amp; Beneath is Aboue: Local, is not Local:
and not Local, is Local: and al this without the authoritie, either of Goddes ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Woorde, or of any one Olde Catholique Father. These be M. Hardinges Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique
Conclusions: euen the very same, that were vsed, and auouched by Euty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
Apollinarius, Manichaeus, and other like Heretiques in olde times: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they may not nowe be counted péeuishe. And that thou maiste the better féele

                  </hi> &amp;c. I suppose, that at the same time, the soule
of Christe, departinge from his Bodie vpon the Crosse, had come vnto, and reasted in one of
the said hostes. If so, then had Christes Bodie benne both quicke, and deade at one time. <hi>Thus
muche D. Holcot. Here hast thou, Good Reader, a taste of M. Hardinges Doctrine:
in respecte whereof al other Doctrine must needes be condemned, and cast as pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uishe.

               <p>This mater, saith M. Hardinge, is so clearely vttered by these fathers, that Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,

very order, and tenoure of these Fathers wordes, <hi>Christe cometh: and yet cometh not.
Christe is not seene: and yet is seene. Christe is touched with handes: yet noman canne touche
him. Euery man seeth him without guile, or erroure: yet noman seeth him. Elias is aboue: and
at the same time, the same Elias is beneath. Elias Coate is called Elias: Chrysostome, and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose

For Natural Reason holden within her bandes, is not the enimie, but the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

without cause be angrie with Reason. But it appeareth, that M. Hardinge, as he
is vtterly without Scriptures, and Doctours in these cases, so is he also voide of
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:12563:198"/>
Reason. As touchinge Plato, it seemeth, there was harde holde, when a Natural

out? It is a simple weapon, that these menne wil refuse, to serue theire turne.</p>
               <p>The Philosophers called <hi>Epicuraei,</hi> helde this fantasie, that God sitteth in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen

without any certaine direction of Goddes gouernement: and that, what so euer
is donne therein, is no parte of Goddes dooinge. Contrary wise the Philosophers
called Stoici, helde an other fantasie, that God him self is nothinge elles but na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and that therefore al thinges are wrought by necessitie, and force of Destine,
and that God is hable to woorke no Miracle, nor to doo any thinge contrary to the

<hi>Natura est, quod Deus vult.</hi> His meaninge is, that Nature is subiecte, and

               <p>This is Goddes knowen, and expresse Wil:<note place="margin">August. De Consecra. Dis. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> prima.</note> therefore by Platoes iudgement, this

               <p>Yet saith M. Harding, S. Augustines woordes be plaine, <hi>Christe was borne in his

                  </hi> The Sacrament after a certaine manner is the Bodie of

                  </hi> The Heauenly Sacrament, whiche verily
dooth represent the Fleashe of Christe, is called Christes Bodie: but not in plaine kinde of

Bodie of Christe, bicause it signifieth the Bodie of Christe. <hi>Touchinge the thinge,

<hi>Secundum literam,</hi> it doothe appeare. And that these wordes, <hi>Secundum literam,</hi> be
oftentimes thus vsed, any man may soone perceiue, that shal diligently note, and
consider the Ancient Fathers. First S. Augustine in the place alleged, vttereth

Iuxta Literam inuenire non possumus, ea, quae in verbis eius Secundum historiam sonant,

woorde, <hi>Quodammodo:</hi> and not of ignorance, but witingely, and willingely
misreported, and falsified S. Augustines meaninge. Certainely S. Augustine
hath not one of al these woordes, neither, By Diuine Power: nor, Inuisibly: nor,
Nature gaue place: nor, Christes Bodie was in moe places, then one.</p>

vnto God, and, I trowe, to M. Hardinge, and to noman biside, al this is nothinge
els, but a Religious Folie, imagined onely to astonne, and amase the Simple. For
the Scriptures, and Holy Fathers are acquainted with no suche Mysterie. The
Sacrament of Baptisme is a Mysterie, euen as is the Sacrament of Christes Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die:
and as Christe is Present in the one, so is he also Present in the other: that is
to say, Truely, Uerily, effectually, and in déede: how be it not in this Grosse man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of M. Hardinges Fleashly Presence. The places of S. Augustine, and S. Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie
concerne onely Christes Incarnation, the Union of the Diuinitie, &amp; the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie,
and other suche Articles, and groundes of Christian Religion, wherein
Nature, &amp; Reason vtterly haue no place: and therfore beinge spoken of one thinge,
are applied by M. Hardinge vnto an other. Neither is M. Hardinge hable truely
to say, that in any of al those places, there is either mention once made, or one
Woorde spoken of the Sacrament. Wherefore it séemeth, M. Hardinge woulde
purposely misleade his Reader, and teache him to Reason in this sorte:

               <p>H. Hardinge seemeth, in parte to disclaime this Article, as a mater of smal
weight, and none of the Principal Keyes of his Religion: wherein I see not, but
I maye safely, and easily graunte vnto him: addinge notwithstanding thus much
withal, That the lesse it is, the lesse hurte is in it. Yet notwithstanding, of late

The prieste was wicked, that woulde not vse it: The people was wicked, that
woulde not allowe it: Their greatest Doctours haue trauailed painfully to know
the cause, and signification of this Mysterie, and yet cannot finde it. Al this not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstandinge,
it is nowe confessed to be a smal mater, of no greate weight, and
suche, as the Churche may wel spare without hinderance. But, as M. Hardinge
here saithe, his Doctrine maye sufficiently be mainteined, and stande vprighte
without this Ceremonie of Eleuation: euen so may wée truely, and iustely saye,
That the Heauenly and infallible Doctrine of the Gospel of Christe, maye like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise

<hi>I maye be ashamed to shewe my face emonge learned menne,</hi> If he meane the learned of his

                  <hi>It is the Mightie Power of God vnto Saluation.</hi> I pray God,

               <p>So Romulus,<note place="margin">Plutarchus in Numae.</note> and Theseus, bicause they were base borne, and noman knew
their Fathers, therefore were reckened, to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Children of the Goddes. Dionysius,
Chrysostomus, and Basile, as they are woorthy of muche credite, for their Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,

<hi>VVhether the Priest did then holde vp the Sacrament ouer his Head, or no.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This thinge M. Hardinge dissembleth, &amp; passeth by: and turneth his whole proufe
to an other thinge, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> neither is doubted of,<note place="margin">Dionysi. Eccles. Hierar. cap. 3.</note> nor denied. First, where as Dionysius
saith, <hi>In conspectum agit, He bringeth the Mysteries into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

fully sée bothe the very grounde, and sense of these woordes of Dionysius, and also
M. Hardinges peruerse, and strange Construction touchinge the same, it may please
thee, gentle Reader, to vnderstande, that in those daies the manner was, that the
Sacrament, being al in one whole loafe, or Cake, vndiuided, should remaine stil
vpon the Holy Table, couered vnder a faire clothe, vntil the time of the Distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

               </p>
               <p>But M. Hardinge replieth, <hi>Maximus saith, Dionysius meante the holdinge vp of the
one parte of the Sacrament.</hi> This maie easily be graunted. But the same Maximus,
what so euer he were, or when so euer he liued, saith not, The same one parte was
holden ouer the Priestes Heade: and therefore M. Hardinge is but weakely reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
by his Authoritie. And againe the same Maximus, as a man not very certaine,
what to saie, diuiseth two other expositions of Dionysius woordes, bisides this.</p>
               <p>But let this Exposition of Maximus stande for good. The priest held vp from the
Table, and shewed foorth the Sacrament, to declare, that the holy Communion
was readie, that the people might prepare them selues, and drawe neare. And the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore
he spake alowde, <hi>Holie thinges for the Holy.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sancta Sanctis. Chrysostom. in Epistol. ad He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braeos homil. 17. Nicolaus Caba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silas.</note> Whiche woordes Chrysostome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth
thus, <hi>Quando Sacerdos dicit, Sancta Sanctis, Hoc dicit, Si quis non est Sanctus,
non accedat. <hi>When the priest saith,</hi> Holy thinges vnto the holy, <hi>thus he saith, If any
man be not holy, let him not come neare.</hi>
                  </hi> So likewise Nicolaus Cabasilas, a Greeke
writer of late daies: <hi>Sacerdos clamat, Sancta Sanctis, propemodum dicens: Ecce panis
vitae: accurrite participes futuri: sed non omnes: verùm, si quis est Sanctus. <hi>The priest
speaketh alowde,</hi> Holy thinges for the holy: <hi>As though he shoulde saie, Beholde the
breade of life: come neare, and take parte: how be it not al, but if any man be holy.</hi>
                  </hi> And lest
he shoulde seeme to discourrage any man in respecte of his vnworthines, he saith
further, <hi>Sanctos autem vocat, non virtute perfectos, sed quicunque ad illam tendunt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionem:
<hi>He calleth them holy, not, that be ful perfite in vertue, but that be inclined to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</hi>
                  </hi>
To this ende therfore the minister shewed foorth the Breade, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
might prepare them selues to the Distribution. And therfore it is writen thus
in Chrysostomes Liturgie, <hi>Sacerdos ostendit Calicem populo, dice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, Cum timore Dei,

spoken of, were of suche authoritie in the Churche, and of suche weight, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
M. Hardinge, nor, I beleue, any other of that side, is hable nowe to shewe vs,
what they were. In the Liturgie, that beareth S. Basiles name,<note place="margin">Liturgia Basilij.</note> it is onely noted
thus, <hi>When the priest saith, Sancta Sanctis, the people answeareth, Vnus Sanctus:
vnus Pater: vnus Filius.</hi> The very same was Chrysostomes meaninge vpon the
Epistle to the Ephesians.<note place="margin">Chrysost. in Epist. ad Ephesios hom. 3.</note> The Courtaines of the holy Communion Table were
drawe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that the Mysteries prepared for the people, might be seene vpon the Table,
not, that the Priest shoulde lifte them vp ouer his heade. The vaine Fable of M.
Hardinges Amphilochius, so often repeted, is not woorth the answearinge.</p>
               <p>Al this notwithstandinge, M. Hardinge doubteth not to make vs beleue, That
al these Fathers spake plainely of the Eleuation of the Sacrament ouer the Prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes
heade: &amp; that, as he saith, accordinge to the custome of the Occidental Churche.
And to that ende he hath pretily falsified the woordes of Maximus. For, where
as Maximus in the Greeke writeth thus, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, M. Hardinge hath
translated it in this wise, <hi>Quem panem Pontifex in sublime attollit, <hi>Whiche Breade the
Bishop lifteth on high.</hi>
                  </hi> And so it were easy, to deceiue the simple, onles the Fathers
had otherwise declared theire owne meaninge.<note place="margin">Pachymeres.</note> Pachymeres expoundeth that

                  </gap>, <hi>He Sheweth, or Lifteth vp.</hi> He saith not, The
Priest lifted the Sacrament aboue his Heade, or On High, as M. Hardinge hath
turned it: but he Shewed the Sacrament a litle vp from the Table, that it might
be seene of the people.<note place="margin">Chrysost. in Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgia. Modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum.</note> And so saith Chrysostome touchinge the same, <hi>Sacerdos mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicum
tollens portionem, quae est in sancta patena, dicit, Sancta Sanctis. <hi>The Priest a Litle
liftinge vp the portion, that is in the holy Dishe, saith, Holy thinges for the holy.</hi>
                  </hi> And so
likewise Claudius du Sain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tes readeth it. And in S. Basiles Liturgie it is thus
noted in the Margin,<note place="margin">Claudius du Sainctes. Cassander.</note> 
                  <hi>Hic Sacerdos Hostiam fractam in patena iacentem, vna cum Pate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na
subleuat, &amp; ostendit populo: <hi>Here the Priest lifteth vp the Hoste, or Sacrament lieinge
broken in the Dishe, and togeather with the Dishe sheweth it vnto the people.</hi>
                  </hi> Yet must al
these be brought foorth to proue this newe manner of Eleuation nowe vsedin the
Churche of Rome. So bolde is M. Hardinge of the simplicitie of the people.</p>
               <p>But one strange thinge, emonge others, I note by the waie in M. Hardinges
answeare, that, beinge demaunded of this late diuised Ceremonie in the Churche
of Rome, he foundeth his whole answeare vpon the East Churche of Grecia, and
sheweth not one example, nor moueth one woorde of the Churche of Rome: and yet
notwithstandinge, he knoweth right wel, that this kinde of Eleuation from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginninge
vntil this daie, was neuer vsed in the Churche of Grecia.</p>
               <p>It seemeth likely, that as wel this vsage, as also sundrie others, of Apparel, of
Oile, etc. grewe first from the imitation of the Ceremonies of the Iewes: emonge

                     </gap>hruma.</note> helde vp the oblation before his
breast. So in the primitiue Churche, what so euer was offered by any man to the
relief of the poore, it was taken by the Priest, and holden vp, and presented in the
Churche, as a pleasant Sacrificie before God. So Chrysostome saith, The Priest
in the time of the holy Ministration lifted vp the Gospel.<note place="margin">In Liturgia. Nicolaus Caba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silas in exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione Liturgiae.</note> His woordes be these:
<hi>Sacerdos in altum tollit Euangelium.</hi> And Nicolaus Cabasilas likewise saith, <hi>His per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actis,
Sacerdos stans super altare, in altum tollit Euangelium, &amp; ostendit. <hi>These thinges
beinge donne, the Priest standinge ouer the Aultare, lifteth the Gospel on high, and she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
it.</hi>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, that the holdinge vp of the Sacrament shoulde importe Adoration to the
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:12563:204"/>
same, as M. Hardinge surmiseth, neither is it thought true by al others of that side,
nor hath it any good sauoure, or shewe of trueth. In deede greate pardonnes, and
Chartars haue benne liberally geuen of late yeeres for the better mainteinance
thereof. And Durandus saith, Therfore Eleuation is made,<note place="margin">Durandus. li. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Vt populus intelligat,
Christum venisse super Altare: <hi>That the people may vnderstande, that Christe is come downe
vpon the Aultar.</hi>
                  </hi> But the Olde learned Fathers, both Greekes, and Latines, when
they helde vp a litle, or shewed the Sacrament, euermore they called the people, to
drawe neare, to receiue, to be partakers of the holy Mysteries, and to lifte vp their
hartes: but in the time of the same Ceremonie, they neuer spake one woorde of Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
Pachymeres saith, <hi>Sacerdos ostendit, haec esse Christi Symbola.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pachymeres in Eccle. Hierar.</note>

               <p>What Theodoretus thought in this behalfe, it is plaine by his owne woordes.
For thus he writeth, <hi>Signa Mystica post Sanctificationem non recedunt à Natura sua:<note place="margin">Theodoret. Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logo. 2.</note>
                     <hi>The Mystical Tokens after the Sanctification, or Consecration goe not from their owne
Nature:</hi>
                  </hi> that is to say, remaine in Substance, and Nature, as thei were before. By
these woordes we may plainely sée Theodoretus iudgement. How be it, in al Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes
twoo thinges must be considered, whereof, as Irenaeus saithe, they doo
consiste. The one is Earthly, the other is Heauenly: The one wée sée with our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
eies, the other wée sée with the eies of our Faithe: The one is in the Earthe,
the other is in Heauen. These partes bicause they are ioined in one Mysterie, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
oftentimes thei scorce names, the one enterchangeably with the other. For as
Christes very Bodie is called Breade, although in déede it be no Breade: So the
Sacramental Breade is called Christes Bodie, although in déede it be not Christes
Bodie. Therefore as the Sacrament is called Christes Bodie, euen so, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge
to the saieinge of Ignatius, it is the Fleashe of Christe,<note place="margin">Theodoret. in Polymorpho.</note> euen the same, that
hath suffred for our Sinnes, and that the Father hath raised againe to life: that is
to say, A Sacrament of that Fleashe. In like sorte S. Chrysostome writeth of
the Sacrament of Baptisme:<note place="margin">Chrysostom. in Epist. ad Hebrae. Homil. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Ostendit hoc loco, idem esse Sanguinem, &amp; Aquam.
Baptisma enim eius, etiam Passio eius est. S. <hi>Paule sheweth in this place, that the Bloud</hi>
                  </hi> (of
Christ) <hi>and the water</hi> (of Baptisme) <hi>are both one. For Christes Baptisme, is Christes Passio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi>
He saith, The Water, &amp; the Bloude of Christe are both one thing, &amp; that, he saith,
was S. Paules meaninge. Yet notwithstandinge, neither is the Water Christes
Bloude in déede: neither is Christes Bloude in déede Material Water. But thus
they borowe eche of them the others name, bicause they are ioyned togeather in
one Mysterie. So is the Bloude of Christe called Water, bicause it cleanseth: so is
the Water called Christes Bloude, bicause it is a Sacrament of that Bloude. And
as S. Chrysostome saithe, The Water of Baptisme is Christes Bloude: euen so
Ignatius saithe, The Breade is the Fleashe of Christe, and none otherwise.
These thinges are plaine, and without cauil.

most manifest by Ireneus, that, as Christes Bodie is the one parte of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
so is Material Breade the other. Likewise in Baptisme, as the one parte of
that holy Mysterie is Christes Bloude, so is the other parte the Material Water.
Neither are these partes ioined togeather in place, but in Mysterie: and therefore
they be oftentimes seuered, and the one is receiued without the other. And for that
cause S. Augustine saith,<note place="margin">Augustin. in li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bro Sententia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum. senten. 338. Et in Iohan. tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctatu. 26.</note>

               </p>
               <p>If any man thinke it strange, that the Sacrament is called the Bodie, and the
Fleashe of Christe, beinge not so in deede, let him vnderstande, That the Written
Woorde of God is likewise called Christes Bodie, and Christes Fleashe, euen the

               <p>Christe, as he had shewed his Disciples before, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he must goe vp to Hierusalem,
and there be Crucified, so beinge at that his last mourneful Supper, he ordeined a

before theire eyes the whole order, and manner of his Passion: As if he
shoulde haue saide, <hi>Thus shal my Bodie be Broken: thus shal my Bloude be sheadde.</hi> This
description of Christes Death so plaine, and so liuely, Hesychius calleth a Sacrifice,
that is to saie, an Examplar, or Resemblance of that Sacrifice, whiche he had to
offer the daie folowinge vpon the Crosse. And in déede, as the Breade was Christes
Bodie, so the Breakinge of the same was Christes Passion. And in this manner of
speache the Ancient Fathers seeme to cal Baptisme a Sacrifice. Chrysostome saith,
<hi>Baptisma Christi,<note place="margin">Chrysost. in Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sto. ad Hebrae.</note> Passio Christi est. <hi>The Baptisme of Christe, is Christes Passion.</hi>

that is to saie,<note place="margin">Chrysost. in Epist. ad Roma.</note> by waie of a Sacrament, and in a Mysterie, but not in deede: to take
awaie the sinnes of the Worlde. In like sense the same Hesychius calleth the Birth

                  </hi> And this he speaketh of the Sacrifice, that Christe made

Sometimes the Accidentes, and Shewes of Breade muste be the Sacrament:
Sometimes Christes Bodie, whiche, as M. Hardinge confesseth, in déede is not
the Sacrament, yet to mainteine this newe Adoration, muste needes become the
Sacrament. And thus now wée haue twoo Sacramentes togeather in one Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.
And yet in the Conclusion, we may not woorship the very Sacrament,
but onely Christes Bodie in the Sacrament. And this, as M. Hardinge telleth vs,
is a Proper, Plaine, Familiar kinde of speache, and accordinge vnto skil. Thus
he teacheth vs to lifte vp our hartes, and to woorship God in Sprite and Trueth.

               <head>M. Hardinge. The .15. Diuision.</head>
               <p>And here this muche is further to be saide, that in the Sacrament of the Aultar the Bodie of
Christe is not Adored by thought of minde sundred from the woorde, but beinge inseparably vnited to
the woorde. For this is specially to be considered, that in the moste Holy Sacrament, the Bodie and
Bloude of Christe are not present by them selues alone, as beinge separated from his Soule, and from
the Godhead: but that there is (166)<note place="margin">The .166. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truethe, Often auouched, and neuer prooued. These vvordes perteine onely to Christe him selfe: And no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge at al vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</note> here his true and liuinge Fleashe, and Bloude ioyned togeather
with his Godhead inseparably, and that they be as him selfe is, perfite, whole, and inseparable.
VVhiche is sufficiently confirmed by sundrie his owne woordes in S. Iohn. I am (saithe he) the Breade
of life. Againe, This is Breade comminge downe from Heauen, that, if any eate of it, he die not.
I am the liuely Breade that came downe from Heauen: If any eate of this Breade he shal liue euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastingly.
And to shewe, what Breade he meante, he concludeth with these woordes: And the Breade,
whiche I shal geue, is my Fleashe, whiche I shal geue for the life of the worlde. By whiche
woordes he assureth vs plainely, that his Fleashe whiche he geueth vs to eate, is ful of life, and ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with his Godhead, whiche bringeth to the woorthy receiuers thereof immortalitie, as wel of
Bodie, as of Soule. VVhiche thinge Fleashe, and Bloude of it selfe coulde not performe, as our Lorde
him selfe declareth plainely, where he saithe as there it foloweth: It is the Spirite that quickeneth,
or geueth life, the fleashe profiteth nothinge. The woordes whiche I haue spoken to you be Spirite,
and life. As though he had saide thus: The Fleashe of it selfe profiteth nothinge, but my Fleashe,
whiche is ful of Godhead and Spirite<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> bringeth and woorketh immortalitie and life euerlastinge to

Thus we vnderstande in this Blissed Sacrament, not onely the Bodie
and Bloude of Christe, but al and whole Christe, God and Man, to be present in substance, and that
for the inseparable vnitie of the person of Christe: and for this cause we acknowledge our selues
bounden to adore him, as ver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>For a clearer declaration hereof,<note place="margin">In Iohan. tractat. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>I</hi> wil not let to recite a notable sentence out of S. Augustine,
where he expoundeth these woordes of Christe: Then, if ye see the Sonne of man goe vp, where he
was before. There had beene no question (saithe he) if he had thus saide: Yf ye see the Sonne of God
goe vp, where he was before. But, where as he saide, The Sonne of man goe vp, where he was before,
what was the Sonne of man in heauen, before that he beganne to be in earth? verily here he saide,
where he was before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as though then he were not there, when he spake these woordes. And in an
other place he saith, Noman hath ascended into heauen, but he, that descended from heauen, the Sonne
of Man, whiche is in heauen. He said not, VVas, but the Sonne of Man (saith he,) whiche is in heauen.
In Earth he spake, and saide him selfe to be in heauen. To what perteineth this, but that we vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande
Christe to be one persone, God, and Man, not two: leaste our Faith be not a Trinitie, but a qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

VVherefore Christe is one, the woorde, the soule, and the fleashe, one Christe: the Sonne of
God, and the Sonne of Man, one Christe. The Sonne of God euer, the Sonne of Man in time: Yet one
Christe, accordinge to the Vnitie of person was in Heauen, when he spake in Earthe. So was the
Sonne of Man in Heauen, as the Sonne of God was in Earth. The Sonne of God in Earth in fleashe
taken, the Sonne of Man in heauen in vnitie of personne. Thus farre S. Augustine.</p>

               <p>It is true, That Christes Bodie, and his Godheade are ioined inseparably, and

                  <pb n="389" facs="tcp:12563:210"/>
it were greate blasphemie. Neuerthelesse, notwithstandinge the Bodie, and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heade
of Christe be ioined in one Persone,<note place="margin">Concil. Chalce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. Actio. 1.</note> yet are they distincte, and sundrie Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res:
The one Finite, the other Infinite: The one in place, the other incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible
without place: The one a Creature, the other the Creator. Neither is
there any Godly honoure dewe vnto the Bodie of Christe in respecte of it self: but
onely, for that it is ioined in one Person with the Diuinitie. Al these thinges be
true, and out of question.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Likewise the woordes, that Christe spake in the sixth Chapter of S. Iohn, &amp;
are here alleged by M. Hardinge, are vndoubtedly true: howe be it not accordin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge
to the simple sounde and tenoure of the letter: For that, as S. Augustine saith,
were,</hi>

                  <hi>Flagitium, &amp; facinus,</hi> An Hainous wickednes: <hi>And, as Origen saith,</hi> It woulde kil
the soule. <hi>And therefore Christe him self expoundeth his owne meaninge touchinge
the same,</hi> It is the Sprite, that geueth life: the Fleashe profiteth nothinge. The woordes,
that I haue spoken, be Sprite, and life. <hi>Whiche woordes S. Augustine expoundeth thus:
<hi>Spiritualiter intelligite, quae locutus sum. No<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hoc Corpus, quod videtis, ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ducaturi estis.</hi>
                  </hi>
Vnderstande ye Spiritually the thinges,<note place="margin">Augustin in Psalm. 98.</note> that I haue spoken. Ye shal not eate this Bodie, that ye
see. <hi>Likewise Chrysostome, <hi>Secundum Spiritum verba mea audienda sunt: Qui secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum
Carnem audit,<note place="margin">Chrysost. in Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han. hom. 47.</note> nihil lucratur, nihil vtilitatis accipit.</hi>
                  </hi> My woordes must be hearde Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually:
Who so heareth them Carnally, or, accordinge to the Fleashe, geateth nothinge, nor
hath any profite by them. <hi>He saith further by waie of obiection against him self, <hi>Quid

                  </hi>
And what is meante by these woordes, <hi>To vnderstande accordinge to the Fleashe?
<hi>He answeareth,</hi>
                  </hi> It is to vnderstande simply, and plainely, euen as thinges be spoken, and to

The woordes, that I spake are sprite, and life. <hi>As if he shoulde saie,</hi> Neither

               <p>Bysides al this, He saith, That whole Christe, both God, and Man, is Really,
Substantially, and Carnally in the Sacrament. This thinge, bicause he is not
hable any way to prooue, he presumeth of him self by authoritie, as though it were
already prooued. It shalbe good, to geue him a daie, to consider the mater, and to
prooue it better. In the meane season the substance of his reason standeth thus:</p>
               <p>The Humanitie, and Diuinitie of Christe are ioined togeather in one Persone,</p>
               <p>

of this inseparable vnion, what so euer is apperteininge, or peculiar to either nature, it is rightly
ascribed, yea and it ought to be ascribed to the whole persone. And this done, as the learned diuines
terme it, <hi>Per communicationem idiomatum.</hi> And thus Cyrillus teacheth, howe Christe maie be

               <p>I maruel, M. Hardinge woulde bestowe so many waste woordes to so smal pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
These Authorities be al true, and, sauinge onely that of the Councel of
Chalcedon, touchinge Nestorius, al truely alleged. But euery thinge, that is true,
maketh not by and by proufe sufficient in euery case. Plinie the Seconde geueth

a good eie vnto his Title, or to the purpose, whereof he writeth, leaste
he happen to wander, and to renne at randon. As nowe, M. Hardinge séemeth
to shoote faire, although a greate waye from the Marke. For in al these woordes
there is no manner mention, neither of the Sacrament, nor of the Adoration ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
nor of any other thinge thereto belonginge. Onlesse M. Hardinge vpon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of these woordes wil reason thus:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>The Sonne of man came downe from Heauen:
<lb/>
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> We must Adoure the Sacramente.</p>
               </q>
               <p>The woordes of Cyrillus be likewise true. <hi>Christes Fleashe is ioyned with the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
and therefore it Naturally geueth life.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iohan. 6.</note> And, when Christe saide, <hi>I wil raise him vp
at the last daie,</hi> He meante, euen as Cyrillus saith, that his Fleashe, that we eate,
shal raise vs vp at the last daie. For, what soeuer fauoure, or mercie we haue from
God, we haue it onely by the Fleashe of Christe. S. Augustine saith, <hi>Mortalis fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus
est Immortalis,<note place="margin">Augustin. in Psalm. 109.</note> ut, peracta sua Morte, nos faceret Immortales. <hi>He that is Immortal, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
Mortal, that through his Death he might make vs Immortal.</hi>
                  </hi> Againe he saith,
<hi>Nos non efficeremur participes Diuinitatis eius,<note place="margin">Augustin. in Psalm. 118.</note> nisi ipse factus fuisset particeps Mortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis
nostrae. <hi>We coulde not be partakers of his Godheade, onlesse he had benne partaker of our
Mortalitie.</hi>
                  </hi> Al these woordes be true, as conteininge nothinge elles, but the expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of these woordes of Christe, <hi>He that eateth my Fleashe, and drinketh my Bloude,
shal liue for euer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But M. Hardinge, to make these woordes of Cyrillus to serue his turne, hath
imagined two greate errours: The one is, <hi>That Christes Bodie cannot be Eaten, but
onely in the Sacrament:</hi> The other is, <hi>That onlesse we receiue Christes Bodie with our
mouth, and swallowe it downe into our belly, we eate it not:</hi> As though either Christe,
or these holy Fathers had meante a Carnal, or Fleashly Eatinge. This whole
Doctrine is horrible, and ful of Desperation. For M. Hardinges position beinge
true, That noman shalbe partaker of that blissed Resurrection, but onely suche as
haue eaten Christes Bodie in the Sacrament, what then shal become of Christian
Children, that haue departed this life, neuer hauinge receiued the Sacrament?</p>
               <p>Who shal raise them vp againe at the last daie? Or dooth M. Hardinge beleue, that
suche litle ones beinge baptized, and so the Members of Christe, shal neuer rise
againe, but lie damned for euer, onely bicause they haue not receiued the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
               <p>Uerily, Christe in these woordes, as it is witnessed by al the holy Fathers,
speaketh not of the Sacrament, but of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Spiritual Eating with our Faith: and in
this behalf vtterly excludeth the Corporal office of our Bodie. Therefore S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine
saith,<note place="margin">Augusti. in Sex. Caput Ioha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nis.</note>

                  <note place="margin">Augustin. De Verbis Apostoli. Sermo. 2.</note> Likewise S. Basile saithe, <hi>Est Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuale

Our Baptisme is a strengthe, or power to Resurrection. <hi>So
S. Augustine, <hi>Nemini dubitandum est, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </hi> No man may doubt, but euery man is then
made partaker of the Bodie, and Bloud of Christe, when in Baptisme he is made the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Christes Bodie. <hi>Likewise S. Chrysostome,</hi> In Baptisme wee are Incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
vnto Christe,<note place="margin">1. Corin. 10.</note> and made Fleashe of his Fleashe, and Boane of his Boanes. <hi>Thus
by Faithe wée Eate the Bodie of Christe, and that, not by way of Imagination,<note place="margin">Chrysost. in epis. ad Ephesi. ho. 20.</note>
or Fantasie, but effectually, verily, and in déede: and therefore Christe shal
rayse vs vp againe at the last day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. Hardinges errour, as I haue saide, resteth herein, that he imagineth,</hi>
That Christes Bodie cannot be eaten, but onely in the Sacrament, and that by the meane,
and office of our bodily mouthe. <hi>But, as it is before alleged out of Rabanus
Maurus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rabanus Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, li. 1. ca. 31.</note> The Sacrament is receiued outwardely with the mouthe of our Bodie: But
the Bodie of Christe is receiued into the Inner Man, and that with the Spiritual mouthe
of our Soule. <hi>And thus bothe may the Sacrament be receiued without Christes
Bodie, and also the Bodie of Christe may be receiued without the Sacrament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hitherto M. Hardinge hath not once touched one woorde of Adoration.</p>
               <p>Concerninge Nestorius, M. Hardinge in the drifte of his tale hath hande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somely
cowched in a greate vntrueth. For where as he saithe, Nestorius
helde this opinion, That in the Sacramente of the Breade, wee receiue onely
Christes Bodie without his Bloud:<note place="margin">M. Harding vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truely allegeth the Councel of Ephesus.</note> and in the Cuppe, the Bloude of Christe
alone without the Bodie: neither did Nestorius, notwithstandinge he were an
Heretique, euer holde this peeuishe erroure, nor is there any suche recorde either
in the Councel of Ephesus, that here vntruely is alleged, or in any other Olde
Councel, or Ancient Father.</p>
               <p>But the right of M. Hardinges cause hangeth of suche Euidence, as neuer was
founde in any recorde. If there be any suche Canon to be founde in that whole
Councel, or any mention thereof made in any of al the Ancient Doctours, let
M. Hardinge shew it, that wee may beleeue him. If, hauinge alleged it so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly,
and so often, he be hable vtterly to shew nothinge, let him geue menne
leaue to thinke, that he abuseth the worlde with Uaine Titles, and meaneth
no trueth.</p>
               <p>Although he might be bolde, freely to diuise mater againste Nestorius, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge
an Heretique, yet he should not thus reporte vntrueth of a General Councel.</p>
               <p>But Cyrillus saithe further, <hi>Wee cannot Eate the Godhead of Christe: It is his
Manhead onely, that is Eaten.</hi> Hereby M. Hardinge thinketh, he is hable to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
our whole Doctrine of Spiritual Eatinge, that is wrought by Faithe.
For thus he wil Reason,</p>
               <q>
                  <p>By your Doctrine, Eatinge of Christes Bodie is beleeuinge:
<lb/>But Cyrillus saith, wee cannot Eate God:
<lb/>
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> By your Doctrine, wee cannot beleeue in God.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Thus he thinketh, wee are driuen, to confesse a greate inconuenience. This
reason seemeth to haue some shew. And therefore I beseeche thee, good Reader, to
consider bothe the partes thereof, and also the answeare.</p>
               <p>Eatinge in common vse of speache, is the receiuinge of foode, and susteinance,
and the turninge of the same into the substance of our bodies: and by a Metaphore,
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:12563:212"/>
or an extraordinarie kinde of speache,<note place="margin">To eate God.</note> is often vsed for the Spiritual eatinge, and
turninge of Heauenly Foode to the refreashinge, and nourisshing of our Soules.
By neither of these waies it can rightly be saide, That wee Eate the Godheade.</p>
               <p>For neither can wee receiue the Maiestie of Goddes diuine Nature, neither turne
the same into the Substance of our Nature. But wee may Receiue, &amp; Eate, and
Feede vpon the Humanitie, and Bodie of Christe, and become Boane of his
Boanes,<note place="margin">Ephesi. 5.</note> and Fleashe of his Fleashe, so as he may dwel in vs, and wee in him.
Wherefore, notwithstandinge Christe be bothe God, and Man, yet wee haue not
our feedinge, and life of Christe in respecte of his Godhead alone, but firste, and
principally in respecte of his Humanitie, in that he was made Man, and became
partaker of Fleashe,<note place="margin">Hebrae. 2.</note> and Bloud, and was Crucified, and sheadde his Bloud, and
yelded vp his Sprite vpon the Crosse. This is our Spiritual feedinge: herein
standeth our whole life. Therfore S. Paule saithe, <hi>Quod nunc viuo in Carne, in fide
viuo Filij Dei,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Galat. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>qui dedit semetipsum pro me. <hi>That I liue nowe in the Fleashe, I liue in

                  </hi>
                  <note place="margin">Galat. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>that hath geuen him selfe for mee.</hi> And againe, <hi>God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidde,
that I shoulde reioice in any thinge, sauinge onely in the Crosse of Iesus Christe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Likewise Saincte Peter,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Actor. 4.</note> There is none other Name geuen vnto men vnder Heauen,
whereby they may be saued, but onely the Name of Christe Iesus. <hi>Thus, as Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillus
saithe,</hi> VVee haue our life, and feedinge, not of the Godheadde, but of the
Manheadde of Christe. <hi>And therefore it is very wel noted vpon the Decrees,

cannot eate the Godhead: yet neuerthelesse wee doo beleeue in God: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Contrary to
your Doctrine, Beleeuinge, and Eatinge are not bothe one. <hi>Uerily, it appeareth bothe
by Cyrillus him selfe, and also by a general consent of other Olde Learned Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
that wee cannot neither Know God, nor Beleeue in God, nor Cal vpon
God, as he is in him selfe, in his Diuine Maiestie, but onely, as it pleased him to
become like vnto vs, and to take vpon him our Mortal Nature. S. Chrysostome
saithe,</hi>

               <p>But it shalbe more tedious then needeful, to recite places out of the Scriptures for proufe of the
Adoration of Christe: there maye of them be founde so greate plentie. Yet bicause Luther was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
so blinde, or rather so Deuilishe, as to denie the Adoration, where notwithstandinge he confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the Presence of Christes True, and Natural Bodie in the Sacrament: I wil here recite what the
Sacramentaries of Zurich haue written against him therefore. VVhat (saye they) is the Breade
the true, and natural Bodie of Christe, and is Christe in the Supper (as the Pope and Luther doo teach)
presente? VVherefore then ought not the Lorde there to be Adored, where ye saye him to be present?
why shal we be forbidden to Adore that, whiche is not onely Sacramentally, but also Corporally the
Bodie of Christe? Thomas toucheth the true Bodie of Christe raised vp from the deade, and fallinge
downe on his knees Adoreth, saiynge: My God, and my Lorde. The Disciples Adore the Lorde, as wel
before,<note place="margin">Iohan. 9.</note> as after his Ascension. Matth. 28. Act. 1. And the Lorde in S. Iohn saithe to the blinde man,
Beleuest thou in the Sonne of God? and he answered him, saieinge: Lorde who is he, that <hi>I</hi> maye
beleeue in him? And Iesus saide to him: Thou haste bothe seene him, and, who speaketh with
thee, he it is. Then he saithe, Lorde <hi>I</hi> beleeue: and he Adored him. Nowe if we were taught,
our Lordes Breade to be the Natural Bodie of Christe, verily we woulde adore it also faithfully with
the Papistes. This muche the Zuinglians against Luther. VVhereby they prooue sufficiently the
Adoration of Christes Bodie in the Sacrament, and so consequently of Christe him selfe God, and Man,
bicause of the inseparable Coniunction of his Diuine, and Humaine Nature in Vnitie of Persone,
so as, where his Bodie is, there is it ioyned, and vnited also vnto his Godheade: and so there Christe
is present perfitely, VVholy, and Substantially, very God, and Man.</p>
               <p>For the cleare vnderstandinge whereof the better to be atteined, the Scholastical Diuines haue
profitably diuised the terme <hi>Concomitantia,</hi> plainely, and truely teachinge, that in this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
after Consecration, vnder the Forme of Breade is Present the Bodie of Christe, and vnder the
Forme of VVine, his Bloude, <hi>Ex vi Sacramenti:</hi> and with the Bodie vnder Forme of Breade, also
the Bloude, the Soule, and Godhead of Christe: and likewise with the Bloude, vnder the Forme of
VVine, the Bodie, Soule, and Godheade, <hi>Ex Concomitantia,</hi> as they terme it, in shorter and
plainer wise vtteringe the same Doctrine of Faith, (168)<note place="margin">The .168. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trueth. For there vvas no suche Doctrine mooued in the Councel of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesus.</note> whiche the Holy Fathers did in the Ephesine
Councel against Nestorius. VVhereby they meane, that where the Bodie of Christe is present, by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
sequele, bicause of the indiuisible Copulation of both Natures in the Vnitie of Persone (for as
muche, as the VVoorde made Fleashe, neuer leafte the Humaine Nature) there is also his Bloude, his
Soule, his Godheade, and so whole, and perfite Christe, God and Man. And in this respecte the terme
is not to be misliked of any Godly learned Man, though some Newe Maisters scoffe at it, who fille
the measure of their predecessours, that likewise haue beene offended with termes for the apter
declaration of certaine necessarie Articles of our Faithe, by Holy, and learned Fathers in General

               <p>M. Hardinge shoulde haue remembred, that the greatest Buttresses, and Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers

               <p>It were muche to be wished, and God of his Mercie so graunte it, if it be his

               <p>Either of them knew, and confessed, that Christes Bodie ought to be Adoured
with godly honour, for that it is ioined in one person with the Diuinitie. But the

yet it is not there, to that vse, and purpose, to be honoured: neither haue
wée any warrant of Goddes woorde, so to honour it. So is Christes Bodie in vs
Naturally, Really, Corporally, Carnally, Substantially, and in deede. Yet may
wée not therefore one kneele downe to an other, so to Adoure Christe beinge

For this woorde, <hi>Transubstantiatio,</hi> signifieth a passinge, or turninge of one
Substance into an other. But that, they thinke, were not tolerable to say, That
the Substance of Breade is changed into the Substance of Christes Bodie. And
therfore <hi>Duns</hi> him selfe vtterly refuseth, and shunneth it: and thinketh it better, to
holde, That the Breade departeth, and geateth it selfe away, &amp; that then in place
of it succeedeth Christes Bodie. And this is now the Common Opinion of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Schoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les.
But this kinde of change cannot in any wise be called, <hi>Transubstantiatio:</hi> but
rather <hi>Cessio, Annihilatio, Successio,</hi> or <hi>Substitutio.</hi> Therefore M. Harding must
goe, and seeke a new name: for <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> wil not serue so wel. Thus after
twelue hundred yeeres studie, they haue founde out a thinge: and yet can not hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
tel, what to make of it. Yet must their determination herein be compared
euen with the Councel of Nice. Uerily Cardinal Beno, that was then aliue, saith,
That Pope Gregorie.<note place="margin">Beno in vita <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the ende he might haue some signe from Heauen, for the certainetie hereof: and
yet in the ende concluded without any reuelation at al.</p>
               <p>Now, touchinge this new Fantasie of <hi>Concomitantia,</hi> after they had once di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised
a new Religion, it was necessary, for ayde of the same, to diuise also newe
woordes. Where as Christ saith, <hi>This is my Bodie:</hi> They say, <hi>This is my Bodie, and my
Bloud.</hi> Where Christe saithe, <hi>This is my Bloud,</hi> They say, <hi>This is my Bloud, and my
Bodie:</hi> And in either parte, they say, is whole Christe, God, and Man. If ye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde
how they know it, they say, not by the Woorde of God, but by this new
imagination of <hi>Concomitantia.</hi> So likewise M. Harding here confesseth, that he
cannot prooue the Adoration of the Sacrament by any warrant of the Scriptures,

                  </hi>
that is to say, Let vs withdraw our eies from the Uisible Sacramentes, and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
let vs beholde Christe, whose Sacramentes they be, and who by the same is
represented. In like manner Dionysius speaketh of the Consecration of the Oile,
<hi>Adducamus vela, &amp;c. <hi>Let vs remoue the veles, and beholde that Spiritual Brightnes it selfe,
&amp;c.</hi>
                  </hi> By whiche Spiritual Brightnesse, doubteles he meante Christe. Thus he
teacheth vs, with our Bodily eies to sée one thinge, and with our Spiritual eies to

eies,<note place="margin">Abdias in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drea.</note> the thinges that be absent. For the more likelihoode hereof, let vs consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
what woordes S. Andrew vseth to the very Material Woodden Crosse of his

                  </hi> Here
are plaine woordes of Inuocation: Here is manifest Adoration. Yet, may the force
of these woordes make vs beléeue, that S. Andrewe in déede gaue Godly Honour to
a Crosse of tree?</p>
               <p>But, bicause M. Hardinge séemeth, to make some accoumpte of this place of
Dionysius, let vs answeare one Mysterie, by an other. S. Ambrose speaketh thus
to the Water of Baptisme:<note place="margin">Ambrosius in Lucam. li. 10. ca. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>O Aqua, quae humano aspersum sanguine, &amp;c. <hi>O thou
Water that hast washed the Worlde, stained with mans Bloude. O thou Water, that
deseruedst to be a Sacramente of Christe. Thou beginnest, thou fulfillest the perfite
Mysteries &amp;c.</hi>
                  </hi> Muste wee needes thinke, bicause S. Ambrose thus speaketh
vnto, and calleth vpon the Water, that therefore either the Water had eares, and
hearde him: or Christe him selfe was there Corporally present in the Water?</p>
               <p>Doubtelesse, bothe Breade, and Water are Material Elementes, and voide of life:
Therefore as S. Ambrose spake vnto the one, euen so, &amp; none otherwise, did Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nysius
speake vnto the other. But for as muche as M. Hardinge séemeth, for Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philochius

               <head>The B. of Sarisburie.</head>
               <p>O howe easy a mater it is, to deceiue the ignorant? Origen in that whole place
speaketh not one woorde, neither of Worshippinge the Sacrament, nor of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes
Real,<note place="margin">Matth. 8.</note> Corporal beinge therein, nor of his Material entringe into our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
But takinge occasion of the Centurion,<note place="margin">Luke. 7.</note> that thought him self vnworthy, to
receiue Christe into his howse, he sheweth, by what waies, and meanes, Christe
vseth to enter into the Faitheful. And two special waies he expressely nameth in
that place. The one, When any Godly man cometh to vs: The other, When we
receiue the holy Communion. His woordes be these: <hi>Quando Sancti, &amp; Deo accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabiles
Ecclesiarum Antistites, &amp;c. <hi>VVhen holy Bishoppes, acceptable vnto God, enter into
thy house, then by them the Lorde dooth enter. And be thou persuaded, that thou receiuest
God him self. An other meane is, when thou receiuest that Incorruptible, and holy Banket.</hi>
                  </hi>
Thus by this holy Fathers iudgement, as Christe entreth into vs by a Bishop, or
holy man, euen so he entreth into vs by the receiuinge of the holy Mysteries. And
so likewise he saith in the first Homilie of the same booke: <hi>Per Euangelistatu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Origen. in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersos Euangelij locos homi. 1.</note>

by the Sacrament of his holy Bodie, and Bloude: and by the Signe of the glorious Crosse.</hi>
                  </hi>
By al these thinges God cometh to vs,<note place="margin">Cometh to vs. Matth. 28.</note> and is in vs: as he him self saith, <hi>Beholde I

when the Arke of God was lifted vp,<note place="margin">Numeri. 10.</note> it seemed, God him selfe was lifted
vp. And therefore in liftinge vp thereof the Priestes saide, <hi>Exurgat Deus:</hi> Let the
Lorde arise:<note place="margin">1. Regum. 4.</note> &amp; when the Arke was brought into the Campe, they saide, <hi>God him self
was come:</hi> And when the Arke was taken, they saide, <hi>The Glorie of Israel was taken.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither maie we thinke, that Origen meante any Corporal, or Real entringe
of Christe into our houses. His owne woordes,<note place="margin">Origen. in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersos Euang. locos. homi. 5.</note> and exposition are to the contrary.

the people from the Sensible Elementes of the Breade, and the Wine, and lifteth
them vp by Spiritual cogitations into Heauen. Thus he speaketh vnto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:

<hi>Where as the Carkesse is, there are the Eagles. The Carkesse is the Lordes Bodie, bicause of
his Death. But Eagles he nameth, to shewe, that he must flee on high, that wil comme neare
to that Bodie.</hi>
                  </hi> Afterwarde he addeth thus, <hi>Ascende ergo ad Coeli portas, &amp; diligenter

placed them euen in the sight of Christe, he saith further vnto them:</hi> For this Bodies
sake thou art no lenger dust, and ashes: This Bodie hath made the free: This Bodie was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for thee vpon the Crosse: This Bodie must wee Adoure, as the Wise men did: This Bodie,
not nowe vpon the Earth, but at the Right hande of God in Heauen: <hi>This Bodie, that
thou seest with thy Sprite, and touchest with thy Faith, whereof the Sacrament
that thou receiuest, is a Mysterie. So saith Emissenus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De Cons Dist. 2. Quia Corpus.</note> 
                  <hi>Sacrum Dei tui Corpus
Fide respice, mente continge, Cordis manu suscipe.</hi> With thy Faith beholde the holy Bodie
of thy God: touche it with thy minde: receiue it with the hande of thy Harte.</p>
               <p>But M. Hardinge wil replie, <hi>Chrysostome saith, As Christe was in the stalle, so he
is now vpon the Aultar: and, as he was sometimes in the Womans Armes, so is he now in the
Priestes Handes.</hi> True it is, Christe was there: and Christe is here: but not in one,
or like sorte of Beinge. For he was in the stalle by Bodily Presence: vpon the
Holy Table he is by waie of a Sacrament. The woman in her armes helde him
Really: the Priest in his handes holdeth him onely in a Mysterie. So saith S. Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le,
<hi>Christe dwelleth in our hartes:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ephe. 3.</note> and no doubtes, the same Christe, that laie in the
stalle. It is one, and the same Christe: but the difference standeth in the manner
of his Being there. For in the stalle he laie by Presence of his Bodie: in our hartes
he lieth by Presence of Faith.</p>
               <p>If this Exposition seeme to M. Hardinge ouer exquisite, or curious, then wil
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:12563:216"/>
I saie further: Christe is so vpon the Table,<note place="margin">Augustin. Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur a Beda in. 1. Corinth. 10.</note> as the Faithful people is vpon the
Table. S. Augustine speakinge to the people saith thus, <hi>Vos estis in Me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sa, vos estis
in Calice: <hi>Yowe are vpon the Table: yowe are in the Cuppe.</hi>
                  </hi> But the people is not there
Grossely, Really, and in deede, but in a Mysterie. Euen so is Christes Bodie vpon
the Table, not Grossely, not Really, or in deede, but in a Mysterie. And as Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
saith, <hi>The Priestholdeth Christe in his hande,</hi> euen so S. Gregorie saith, <hi>Abel helde
Christe in his hande,</hi> and that foure thousande yeeres before Christe was borne: and
yet, not a bare signe, or a naked token, but the very same Christe, that Esaie sawe,
and that Iohn Baptist pointed with his finger. For thus stande his woordes:
<hi>Quem Iohannes in Ostensione, quem Esaias in locutione,<note place="margin">Gregori. in Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum li. 29. c. 38.</note> hunc Abel Significando in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus
tenuit.</hi> Thus Chrysostome saith, the Priest holdeth Christe in his hande, as
Iohn Baptist helde him: as Esaie helde him: as Abel helde him.</p>
               <p>And, that this was Chrysostomes meaninge, it appeareth by the very forme,
and order of his woordes. For he saith, Thou Seest the holy Ghost: thou Seest, &amp;
Touchest that princely Bodie. Thus he speaketh of a Spiritual seeinge, and tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinge,
wherewith we see, and touche thinges, be they neuer so farre absent from
vs. For otherwise, touchinge bodily sight, M. Hardinge knoweth, the Holy Ghost
cannot be seene: and by his owne Doctrine, the Bodie of Christe is there Inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.</p>
               <p>But least M. Hardinge take occasion hereof, to saie, <hi>This is a Fantastical, and a
Vaine kinde of seeinge,</hi> Let him remember the woordes that S. Hierome writeth to

and yet the Childe was not there. Thus she did, not verily, or in deede: and yet not
vainely, nor by waie of Fantasie notwithstandinge: but truely, and effectually, by
Presence of Faith.</p>
               <p>Thus did the Wise menne see Christe: thus doo we nowe see Christe. Thus did
they worship him: thus doo we worship him. They sawe him, and worshipped him

               <p>And in this behalf S. Ambrose saith,<note place="margin">Ambros de his, qui initiantur Mysterijs. Ca. 3.</note>

But the eie of our Soule, whiche is Faith, cannot deceiue vs.</p>
               <p>M. Hardinges reason hereof standeth thus: The Priest at the time of the holy

Iesus Christe our God from thy holy Tabernacle, and from the Throne of thy Glorie: <hi>Ergo,</hi>
he made his praiers, and gaue Adoration to the Sacrament.</hi> Of the same premisses he might
muche better conclude the contrary. The Priest withdrewe his minde from these
Sensible, and Corruptible Elementes, and Adoured Christe beinge in Heauen in
his Tabernacle, and in the Throne of his Glory, <hi>Ergo,</hi> he did not Adoure the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</p>

               <p>S. Augustines learned handlinge of this place of the Psalme, Adore ye his Footestoole, bicause it
is Holy, maketh so euidently for this purpose, that of al other authorities whiche in greate number
might be broughte for proufe of the same, it ought leaste to be omitted. The place beinge longe, <hi>I</hi> wil
recite it in Englishe onely. His woordes be these: Adore ye his Footestoole:<note place="margin">In Psal. 98.</note> bicause it is Holie. See ye
Brethern, what that is, he biddeth vs to Adore. In an other place the Scripture saithe:<note place="margin">Esai. 66.</note> Heauen is my

Earthe, bicause he saide in an other place, that it is the Footestoole of God? And howe shal we A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore
the Earthe, where as the Scripture saithe plainely, Thou shalt Adore thy Lorde thy God, and
here he saithe, Adore ye his footestoole? But he expoundeth to me,<note place="margin">Deut. 6. 10.</note> what his footestoole is, and saithe:
and the Earth is my footestoole.<note place="margin">Matth. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>I</hi> am made doubteful, afraied <hi>I</hi> am to adore the Earthe, leste he damne

the Psalme saithe to me, adore ye his footestoole. <hi>I</hi> seeke, what thinge is his footestoole, and the
Scripture telleth me, The Earth is my footestoole. Beinge thus waueringe, <hi>I</hi> turne me to Christ, bicause
him <hi>I</hi> seeke here, and <hi>I</hi> finde, how without impietie the Earth may be adored. For he tooke of Earthe,
Earth,<note place="margin">VVe eate Christ sittinge in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: And so vvee Adoure him, not lieing vnder Accidentes, but sittinge in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</note> bicause Fleashe is of Earth, and of the Fleashe of Marie he tooke Fleash. And bicause he walked
here in Fleashe, and that very Fleashe he gaue vs to eate to Saluation, and noman eateth that Fleash,
except firste he adore it: it is founde out how such a footestoole of our Lorde may be adored, and howe
we not onely sinne not by adoringe, but sinne by not adoringe. Doth not the Fleashe quicken, and geue
life? Our Lorde himselfe saide, when he spake of the commendation it selfe of that Earthe:<note place="margin">Ioan. 6.</note> It is the
spirite that quickeneth, but the Fleashe profiteth nothinge. Therfore, when thou bowest thee selfe, and

thou doest adore, for bicause of him thou doest adore. And therefore here he added: Adore ye his foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoole,
bicause it is Holy. VVho is Holy? He for whose loue thou adorest his footestoole. And when thou
adorest him, remaine not by cogitation in Fleashe, that thou be not quickened of the Spirite. For the

               <p>The Poore, that haue refused, and forsaken them selues, Eate Christe sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge

of the Worlde: they forsake not them selues: they folowe not Christe: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they are not filled with him. Thus dooth S. Augustine expounde his owne
meaninge:<note place="margin">Augustin. in Psalm. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>Inde erat Piscator &amp;c. <hi>Of those Poore was Peter, and Iohn, and Iames, and
Matthew the Publicane. They did Eate, and weare filled: for they suffred the same thinges,
that they had Eaten<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Christe gaue to them his Supper: he gaue to them his Passion: He is
filled, that foloweth the same.</hi>
                  </hi> Hitherto S. Augustine speaketh not one woorde of
Adoration, either of the Sacrament, or of Christes Bodie, as beinge Really Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sente
in the Sacrament. Therefore M. Hardinge was the more blamewoorthy,
thus to adde woordes of his owne vnto S. Augustine, and so vtterly to falsifie, and
to corrupte his meaninge. It is no good Catholique pointe, so to vse the Olde Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
Uerily,<note place="margin">Augustin. in eundem Psalm.</note> where as S. Augustine writeth thus, <hi>Nec sicut Pauperes saturati sunt
vsque ad imitationem: Sed tamen Adorauerunt: <hi>Neither were they filled as the Poore, euen
vnto the folowinge: and yet notwithstandinge they Adoured:</hi>
                  </hi> M. Harding addeth therto

His frendes wil hardely thinke, there is so muche conninge in his dealinge. He
cannot lightly lacke Authorities, as longe as he canne thus shape the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his owne.
But S. Augustine knoweth not, neither this Commentarie, not this texte: nor
euer gaue M. Hardinge to vnderstande of this Corporal Presence. As it is saide,
and prooued before, wée sée Christe, and worship Christe sittinge in Heauen.</p>
               <p>Certainely S. Augustine,<note place="margin">Augustin. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini. quinta post Trinita. Sermo. 1.</note> who best knew his owne minde, saith thus, <hi>Habes

they feadde of Akecornes, and dranke water: and therefore in remembrance, and
witnesse of so greate a benefite, they honoured the one with Breade, and the other
with Wyne. But that they euer honoured the Elementes of Breade, and

we knowe, that Breade, Wine, and Water, of them selfe be nothinge els, but cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible,

labour euermore, to drawe vs from the outwarde visible Creatures, to the

but beinge sanctified by the Heauenly Grace, by meane of the Prieste, it is deliuered from the

Nature of Breade remaine in it stil.</hi>
                  </hi> Thus, as Chrysostome saith, The Breade remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth

M. Hardinge cannot denie them. And yet notwithstandinge, it is not the thinge, it
was before: bicause it is also called the Lordes Bodie. So likewise saithe S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine,

                  </hi> (that is, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> very Bodie of Christe.) And so vnto them Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na
was Christes Bodie, and not the same thinge, it was before. And for better
Declaration hereof, Bertramus saithe, <hi>Christus vt nunc Panem conuertit in Corpus
suum, ita tum Manna de Coelo datum, suum Corpus Inuisibiliter operatus est. <hi>Christe,
as he now turneth the Breade into his Bodie, euen so then in like sorte the Manna, that fel from

                  </hi> Thus, as the Breade is Christes Bodie, euen so
was Manna Christes Bodie: and that Inuisibly, and by the Omnipotent Power
of God. Thus are the Elementes of Manna, of the Breade, of the Wine, and of
the Water, changed, and are not as they were before: and therefore in euery of
the same we Honour the Bodie of Christe Inuisible, not as Really, and Fleashe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

whiche are not seene, but vnderstanded, and beleeued, whereby he Signifieth the Inuisible thinge

that bicause through power of the Mystical Blissinge, the Signes be in existence, and in deede the

forbidde, that Christen people shoulde be tought to Adore, and woorship the insensible Creatures,

not, but the discrete Reader shal soone perceiue, he hath prooued as wel the one, as
the other. Touchinge Real Presence Theodoretus speaketh nothinge, no not one

S. Ambrose calleth the Sacrament a Creature, and that twise togeather in one

               <p>M. Hardinge wil saie, By this Construction, <hi>Adorantur,</hi> is as muche to say,

                  </hi> that is, <hi>They are not Honoured:</hi> but
onely leade vs to those thinges, that muste be honoured. Herein is none incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience.
For so, it appeareth, Theodoretus expoundeth his owne meaninge.</p>
               <p>His woordes immediatly folowinge are these: <hi>Confer ergo Imaginem cum Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plari,

Cheastes, in Baskettes, and in Naptkins. Nowe, if M. Hardinge be hable, truely
to shewe any suche like Ancient Authoritie for his Canopie, then maie he saie, he
holdeth by the Olde Catolique Fathers. But, for as muche, as M. Hardinge
hath leisure, to cal to minde his Olde Fable, of Momus, Uenus, and suche like: In
deede they saie, Momus was woonte to espie faultes, and to control al the Goddes
without exception, euen the Greate Iuppiter, him self, that sate in Rome in the
Capitol: and therefore his office oftetimes was not so thankeful, as some others.
But one greate faulte he founde with Uulcane, for the makinge of man, for that he
had not sette a grate, or a windowe at his breaste, that others might piere in, and
espie some parte of his secrete thoughtes. If M. Hardinge had suche a grate, or
windowe at his breaste, and menne might looke in, and see his conscience, I doubte
not, but they shoulde sée many moe sparkes of goddes trueth, then as nowe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly

the Sonne of God, with the heauenly beames of his holy Woorde hath reueiled
it. O, Woulde to God, we had no cause iustly to saie with the Prophete Esaie,

In a Chapel: In the Uestrie: In the Bishoppes Palace. And al this of the vsage

But emongst al these diuersities of keepinge, he hath not yet founde out

where as the Sacrament was reserued onely in the Bishops Custodie, it foloweth
necessarily, that there, in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But, me thinketh, M. Hardinge dooth herein, as Apelles the Painter sometime
did, in setting out Kinge Antigonus physenomie. For vnderstandinge, that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonus

halfe face, and so he conningly shadowed the deformitie of the other eye. Euen so
M. Hardinge sheweth vs certaine varietie of keepinge the Sacrament, and other
smal maters of like weight: but the danger of Idolatrie, and other like horrible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formities
he dissembleth conningly, and turneth from vs. Lothe I am, to vse the

               <p>In the olde times, when the Sacrament was keapte in Cheastes, in Napte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins,

               <p>But vnder the Canopie wée sée, not onely, that the effecte hath fallen out farre

haue so often hearde vnder the name of Amphilochius. Concerninge whiche Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
(for a very childishe Fable it is, and no better) I must for shortenesse referre
thée, gentle Reader, to that is written before in the First Article of this Book, and
in the .33. Diuision, as answeare to the same. Yet thus muche shortly, and by the
waye. First M. Hardinges Amphilochius saith, that S. Basile, after he had saide
Masse to Christe, and his twelue Apostles, immediately the same night, put one
portion of the Sacrament in the Dooue, that was then hanging ouer the Aultar:
&amp; the nexte daye folowinge sente for a Goldesmith, &amp; caused the same Dooue to be
made: the same Dooue, I saye, that he put the Sacrament in, the night before. And
so M. Hardinges Dooue, was a Dooue, before it was made. But Dreames, &amp; Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
are woorthy of Priuilege. Yet, least this tale should passe alone, it is accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
with a Miracle. For after that time, when so euer S. Basile was at Masse, &amp;
lifted vp the Breade, the same Dooue (so saithe this Amphilochius) vsed euermore
to rowse her selfe ouer y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Aultar, &amp; mooued, &amp; sturred of her selfe hither, and thither:
muche like to the Mathematical Dooue, that Architas Tarentinus made, that was
hable to flie alone. If this Golden Dooue had not beene endewed with Sprite, &amp;
Life, this tale had lost halfe his grace. Againe Pekham in his Prouincial geueth
a straite commaundement to al Priestes, that the Breade in the Pyxe, be changed
and renewed euery seuenth day, for avoidinge of putrefaction, or some other loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somnesse,
that may happen. But M. Hardinges Golden Dooue had a special vertue
aboue al others, to keepe the Breade seuen yéeres togeather without corruption,
and the same at the last, méete to be geuen to a sicke man in his death bedde.</p>

But there is mention made of Golden, and Siluern Dooues in the Councel of
Constantinople. I graunte. How be it, there is no mention made there of any
Pyxe, or Reseruation of the Sacrament. But if euery Dooue there were a Pyxe, or,
as they cal it, a Monster, then hath M. Hardinge a greate aduantage. For séeking
out but one Pyxe, he hath founde twentie, and that al togeather in one Churche,
some aboute the Aultar, some aboute the holy Fonte, and some els where. And
yet I coulde neuer vnderstande, but euermore in one Churche, were it neuer so

For the woordes of the Scripture might be saued</hi> (without Transubstantiation) <hi>by an
easy, and truer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vnderstandinge in appearance.</hi> Thus it appeareth by D. Tonstal, that
this Doctrine hath no grounde of Antiquitie: and by Biel, and Scotus, that it
hath no certaine Authoritie of Goddes woorde. Upon this fundation, whiche by
their owne Confessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is vncertaine, M. Hardinge buildeth vp the whole certaintie
of this Article.</p>
               <p>But he wil replie, Christ saith, <hi>This is my Bodie.</hi> So the Arian Heretiques were
hable to allege as many, and as plaine woordes of Christe, <hi>Pater maior me est,
<hi>My Father is greater then I.</hi>
                  </hi> Neither euer was there any Heresie so grosse, but was
hable to make some simple shewe of Goddes Woorde. But Christe saith not,
<hi>This Breade, is nowe no Breade:</hi> Or, <hi>This Breade, is Transubstantiate into my Bodie:</hi> Or,
<hi>My Bodie is Really, and Fleashely conteined vnder the Accidentes of this Breade.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But contrary wise the Euangelistes doo witnesse, That Christe tooke Breade:
and S. Paule after Consecration sundrie times calleth it Breade:<note place="margin">1. Corin. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Fathers expressely, and constantly affirme, that the Breade remaineth stil in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

               <p>Neuerthelesse, in that sense, and meaninge, that Christe spake in, that Breade
was Christes Bodie. For in this case we maie not consider, what Breade is in it
self, but what it is by Christes Institution. As the Bodie of Christe is his very
Natural Bodie: So the Breade in it self, is very Natural Breade. And yet by waie
of a Sacrament,<note place="margin">1. Corin. 10. Augustin. in Leuitt. quaest. 57.</note> the Breade both is called, and also is Christes Bodie. So S. Paule
saith, <hi>The Rocke was Christe:</hi> And S. Augustine saith, <hi>Non dicit, Petra Significabat
Christum: sed, Petra erat Christus. He <hi>saith not, The Rocke Signified Christe: but, The
Rocke was Christe.</hi>
                  </hi> The Rocke naturally, &amp; in deede was a Rocke, as it was before.
Yet,<note place="margin">Deuteron. 12.</note> bicause it gaue water, to refreashe the people, by a Sacramental vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge

                  </hi> Whiche woordes rightly vnderstanded are true: and yet to saie, that

And to come neare to the Institution of Christes Supper,<note place="margin">Luc. 22. 1. Corin. 11.</note> S. Luke, and S. Paule
saie, <hi>This Cuppe is the Newe Testament.</hi> Yet was not the Substance, and Nature of
the Cuppe changed by any force of these Woordes: neither was that Cuppe in
deede, and Really the Newe Testament. Nowe, As the Rocke was Christe: The
Bloude is the Soule: The Cuppe is the Newe Testament, remaininge notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standinge
eche of them in theire seueral Nature and Substance: Euen so is the
Breade, the Bodie of Christe: remaininge stil notwithstandinge in the Nature,
and Substance of very Breade. It is a Sacrament, that Christe ordeined: and the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore
must haue a Sacramental vnderstandinge. Uerily, as Water remaininge
stil Water, is the Sacrament of Christes Bloude: So Breade remaininge stil
Breade, is the Sacrament of Christes Bodie.</p>
               <p>But the contrary hereof was determined in the Councel of Laterane in Rome
aboute the yeere of our Lorde.<note place="margin">Concil. Lateran. sub Innocentio 3. Anno. 1215.</note> 1215. Howe be it, the determination of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel

not in shape, but in nature, by the almightie power of the woorde (he meaneth Christes woorde of

that remaineth, but in Nature, that is to saie, in Substance. And to signifie the chaunge of Substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,

we must beleue, they are nothinge elles, but the Fleashe, and Bloude of Christe. After the opinion of
this Father, the shewe and figure of Breade and VVine are seene, and therefore remaine after Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration.
And if we must beleue, that whiche was Breade, and VVine before, to be none other
thinge, but the Fleashe and Bloude of Christe, then are they no other thinge in deede. For if they were,
we might so beleue. For beleefe is grounded vpon trueth, and what so euer is not true, is not to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leued.
Hereof it foloweth, that after Consecration the accidentes, and shewes onely remaine with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

               <p>But for contentation of the Reader, to answeare that thinge, that séemeth worthy
of no answeare, we must vnderstande, that the Breade, the Wine, &amp; the Water, of
their owne Nature, without further Consideration, are nothinge els but vsual,
and simple creatures.<note place="margin">Augusti. contra Maximin. li. 3. Ambrosius de ijs, qui initian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur Mysterijs. cap. 2.</note> And therefore S. Augustine geueth this general rule tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinge
the same, <hi>In Sacramentes we must consider, not what they be of them self, but what
they Signifie.</hi> So S. Ambrose writeth of the Water of Baptisme: <hi>Quid vidisti?
Aquas vtique: sed no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> solas. Apostolus docuit, non ea co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>templanda, quae videntur, sed quae

                  <note place="margin">Ambrosius de Sacramentis. li. 4. cap. 4.</note> Otherwise touchinge the very Substance of the Breade, and the
Wine, he saith, <hi>Sunt, quae erant: <hi>They be the same thinges, that they were.</hi>
                  </hi> And imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly

                  <hi>a Common, and a Knowen Creature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet neuerthelesse, touchinge the effecte of the Sacrament, we consider not
the corruptible Natures, or outwarde Elementes, but directe our Faith onely to
the Bodie, and Bloude of Christe. S. Ambrose him self leadeth vs thus to saie,
<hi>Ante Benedictionem Verborum Coelestium alia species nominatur:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ambros. de ijs, qui initiantur Mysterijs. cap. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>post Consecratione<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
Corpus Christi Significatur. <hi>Before the Blissinge of the Heauenly VVoordes, it is called
an other kinde: but after the Consecration, the Bodie of Christe is Signified.</hi>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>But M. Hardinge wil replie, This Ambrose saith, <hi>Figura Panis, &amp; Vini videtur:
<hi>The Figure of Breade, and VVine is seene:</hi>
                  </hi> Therefore we must needes confesse, there
are Accidentes without a Subiecte. If any Olde Writer, Greeke, or Latine:
learned, or vnlearned, euer vsed this Woorde, <hi>Figura,</hi> in this sense, to wite, to si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifie
a Shewe alone without any Substance, then maie M. Hardinge seeme to
saie somewhat. If neuer any writer vsed it so, then haue we good cause, to doubte
his Conclusion. Uerily, to leaue other olde writers of al sortes, S. Ambrose him self
saith, <hi>Christus apparet in Figura Humana. <hi>Christe appeareth in the Forme, or Figure of a
Man.</hi>
                  </hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ambros. in Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stol. ad Colossen. cap. 1.</note> And S. Paule saith to like purpose, <hi>Formam Serui accepit: <hi>Christe tooke vpon

                  </hi> I thinke, M. Hardinge wil not warrant vs vpon the force
of these woordes,<note place="margin">Philippen 2.</note> that Christe had onely the Shape, and Shewe, and not the very
Substance, and Nature of a Mannes Bodie. For in so saieinge, he shoulde seeme

this woorde, <hi>Figura,</hi> cannot further his purpose.</p>
               <p>But S. Ambrose saith, <hi>Nihil aliud credendum: <hi>VVe must beleue, there is nothinge
els. Therefore,</hi>
                  </hi> saith M. Hardinge, <hi>There is no Breade.</hi> I maruel, he hath no further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight,
nor better skil in his owne Argumentes. For here he concludeth a plaine

                  </gap>ontradictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> against him self. For if there be nothinge els, but the Bodie of Christ,
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:12563:229"/>
and we must also beleeue the same, then is there neither Forme, nor Figure, nor
Weight, nor Sauoure there: whiche is contrary to M. Hardinges owne first posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
and yet by these woo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

before saide, that, accordinge to the Doctrine of S. Augustine, in al Sacramentes
we sequester our mindes vtterly from the Sensible Creatures, and with our Faith
beholde onely the thinges, that thereby are represented.</p>
               <p>For answeare to the other two places of S. Ambrose here alleged, touchinge

The question betweene vs is not, whether the Breade be the Bodie of Christe, or
no: but whether in plaine, and simple manner of speache it be Fleashely, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
the Bodie of Christe.<note place="margin">Augustin. Epist. 23.</note> S. Augustine saithe, <hi>Secundum Quendam Modum Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentum

                  </hi> (of speach)
<hi>the Sacrament of Christes Bodie, is the Bodie of Christe.</hi> And S. Ambrose him selfe herein
séemeth wel, and sufficiently to open his owne meaninge. For thus he writeth,
as is before alleged:<note place="margin">Ambros. de ijs qui initiantur Mysterijs ca. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Post Consecrationem Corupus Christi Significatur: post Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crationem

                  <hi>In Similitudinem accipis Sacramentum. <hi>After Consecration, the Bodie of Christe is
Signified: After Consecration, it is Called the Bloude of Christe: We receiue the Mystical
Cuppe of Bloude,</hi>

                     <hi>in Example of the Bloude of Christe: We Signifie the Fleashe, and Bloud
of Christe, that were offered for vs: Thou drinkest the Likenes of that Pretiouse Bloude: It
is a Figure of the Bodie: and Bloude of our Lorde: For a Likenes, or Resemblance</hi>
                  </hi> (of the
Bodie of Christe) <hi>thou receiuest the Sacrament.</hi> Thus many waies it seemed good to
S. Ambrose, to qualifie the heate, and rigour of his other woordes.</p>
               <p>Nowe, if M. Hardinge, as his manner is, wil cal al these, Naked Signes, and
Bare Figures, let him then remember, he maketh sporte, &amp; game at S. Ambrose,

so in respecte of Christes Bodie, and Bloude, that are represented, the Breade, and
Wine seeme nothinge. Thus, S. Ambrose saithe, in either Sacrament the power
of Consecration is greater, then the power of Nature: Thus by Consecration Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

               <p>Here, good Christian Reader, I beseche the to consider thus muche by the way.
In the Uniuersitie of Oxforde,<note place="margin">Anno. 1554.</note> and in the late Solemne Disputation holden there
againste that godly Father, and Martyr of blissed Memorie D. Cranmere the
Archebishop of Canturburie, the Authoritie of this Father Theodoretus was vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
refused in open audience, for that he was a Grecian: and therfore not thought
to iudge Catholiquely of the Sacramentes, accordinge to the late Determination
of the Churche of Rome. Whiche thinge notwithstandinge, it appeareth, M.
Hardinge hath nowe reconciled him, and made him Catholique. How be it, this
thinge séemeth very strange, that one man, in the vtteringe of one Sentence, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any manner alteringe, or change of Woorde, should be bothe an Heretique, and
a Catholique, bothe togeather.</p>
               <p>Concerninge the greatest Substance hereof, this place of Theodoretus is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweared
before, in the eighth Article, and in the .28. Diuision. Here he saithe, <hi>That
the Breade, and the Wine are seene, and touched, as they were before.</hi> Hereof M. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge
concludeth thus, <hi>Ergo, <hi>there is neither Breade, nor Wine remaininge, but onely
Accidentes, and shewes without Substance.</hi>
                  </hi> This Argument of it selfe is strange, and
woonderful, and the more, for that it concludeth plaine contrary, not onely to the
meaninge, but also to the expresse, and euident woordes of Theodoretus. For thus
his woordes lie:<note place="margin">Theodoret. Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logo. 1. Immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilis.</note> 
                  <hi>Qui se ipsum appellauit vitem, ille Symbola, &amp; Signa, quae videntur, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellatione

               </p>
               <p>Now let vs compare this texte with M. Hardinges Glose. Theodoretus saith,
<hi>The Breade, and Wine departe not from their Owne Nature:</hi> M. Hardinge saithe, <hi>They
departe vtterly from their Owne Nature.</hi> Theodoretus saithe, <hi>The Breade, and VVine
remaine in their former Substance:</hi> M. Hardinge saithe, <hi>There remaine onely the Shewes, and
Accidentes of Breade, and VVine, without any their former Substance.</hi> It is a bolde Glose, that
thus dareth to ouerthrowe the manifest meaninge of the Texte. I trowe suche
dealinge shoulde be rectified by a Write of Errour.</p>
               <p>Of these plaine woordes of Theodoretus, we may wel conclude thus against M.
Hardinge: The Substance of the Breade, and Wine remaineth stil, as it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
Therefore the Accidentes, and Shewes of Breade and Wine, be not there
without their Substance. For the rest, How these Mystical Signes be vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,

Chrysostome saithe,<note place="margin">Chrysostom. in Matth. homi. 83.</note> 
                  <hi>Oculis intellectus ista perspiciamus. Nihil enim Sensibile tradidit

                  </hi>
I thinke, M. Hardinge wil not denie, but the Water in Baptisme is a thinge
Sensible: likewise, that the Breade, and Wine in the holy Mysteries, or, at the
least, the Accidentes, and Shewes thereof, are thinges Sensible. But S. Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome
withdraweth vs from the Breade, the Wine, the Water, and al other like
thinges, that be Sensible, to the consideration of the Bodie, and Bloude of Christ,
that are not Sensible: in comparison whereof, al the reste are consumed, and
seeme nothinge.</p>

the meaninge whereof nothinge toutcheth, neither the Breade, nor

And therefore this place so vnaduisedly chosen, can litle further M. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinges

Not this Breade, that passeth into the Bodie: but that Breade of euerlasting life, that strengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth

               <p>This Cyrillus Hierosolymitanus is an Olde Authour newely sette foorthe. I

be very muche like to M. Hardinges iudgement in this Article, that is to say,
like <hi>Accidens sine Subiecto, A <hi>shewe of woordes without Substance.</hi>
                  </hi> He seemeth bothe
in woordes, and sense fully to agree with Chrysostome, Oecumenius, and other
Gréeke Fathers, that neuer vnderstoode this M. Hardinges Newe Religion. He
shutteth vp the Hearers bodily eyes, wherewith they sée the Breade, and
Wine: and boroweth onely the Inner eies of their mindes, wherewith they may
sée the very Bodie, and Bloude of Christe, whiche is that Breade, that came from
Heauen. And herein, notwithstanding his woordes be quicke, &amp; violent, the more
to sturre, and enflame the hartes of them, vnto whom he speaketh, yet he him
selfe in plainest wise openeth, &amp; cleareth his owne meaninge. For thus he writeth,
<hi>Ne consideres, tanquam Panem Nudum: Panis Eucharistiae non est amplius Panis Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex,

                  <hi>Consider it not, as if it were Bare Breade: The Breade of the Sacramente is
no lenger Bare and Simple Breade.</hi> Whiche woordes are naturally resolued thus: <hi>It is
Breade: how be it not onely bare Breade: but breade, and some other thinge elles biside.</hi> So,
where they of M. Hardinges side are woonte to saye, <hi>Papa non est Purus homo: <hi>The
Pope is not a Bare man,</hi>
                  </hi> I trowe, their meaninge is not, That the Pope is no man:
but onely, that he is a man, &amp; yet besides that, hath an other Capacitie, aboue the
condition, and state of common men. Of these woordes of Cyrillus we maye wel
reason thus by the waye: <hi>The Sacrament is not onely, or Bare Breade: Therefore it is
Breade, al be it not onely Bare Breade.</hi> And thus the same Cyrillus, that is brought
to testifie, that there remaineth no Breade in the Sacramente, testifieth moste
plainely to the contrary, that there is Breade remaininge in the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>And although this answeare of it selfe might séeme sufficient, yet (good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian

as this Cyrillus speaketh here of the Sacrament of Our Lordes Bodie, &amp; Bloude,
euen so, and in like phrase, and forme of woordes, he speaketh of the Oile, that they
calle Holy, of the Water of Baptisme, and of other Ceremonies. Of the Oile he

M. Hardinge findinge him self muche encumbred with his Accidentes, is faine to

in the Scholes are taught to knowe, that an Accident hath no Beinge without a
Subiecte. Which rule beinge otherwise euermore true, hath Exception, as M.
Hardinge saith, onely in this Sacrament, wherein be the Accidentes, and Shewes
of Breade, and Wine, and yet no Subiecte. For they are not in the Breade: bicau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
(as he saith) that is gonne: nor in the Aier, for that cannot be seene: nor in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes

white: And a rounde thinge, yet nothinge is rounde. Therefore, for as muche as
these Accidentes neither are hable to stande alone, nor haue any subiecte there to
reast in, for that cause, M. Harding saith, they be susteined by the Power of God.</p>

<hi>Beinge in.</hi> For one thinge may be in an other, as in an Instrument, as the Light is
in a Candle: whiche is the similitude, that Basile vseth. The same thinge maie be
in an other, as in a Subiecte: as Light in the Aire. This diuersitie considered, now
let vs weigh M. Hardinges reason.</p>
               <p>The Light, <hi>saith he,</hi> was not in the Sonne, as in an Instrument to carrie it aboute the
world: <hi>Ergo,</hi> It was not in the Ayre, as in a Subiecte.</p>
               <p>This argument seemeth very Light. A man maie easily, and sensibly with his
fingers féele the folie of it in the Darke. Verily S. Basiles woordes to the contrary

to say, That, as he was hable to diuise these Mystical Significations, so
he was also hable to diuise the number of partes, and manner of Breakinge. But
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:12563:236"/>
what greate Mysteries there may be in this Breakinge of outwarde Formes,
and Accidentes, that M. Hardinge imagineth, I leaue vnto him self to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider.</p>
               <p>The Fable of Amphilochius hath benne sixe times alleged by M. Hardinge in
this one booke, to sundrie purposes: and yet he him self knoweth, it is but a very
peeuishe Fable. Who so listeth to knowe it further, maie finde it answeared in the
first Article, and in the .33. Diuision.</p>
               <p>But where as this Sergius saith, <hi>Triforme est Corpus Domini, <hi>The Bodie of our
Lorde is of three Formes,</hi>
                  </hi> What so euer his meaninge therein were, his speache is
very strange, or rather monstrouse. For the Bodie of Christe is not of so many
Formes, but onely One, and Uniforme. One of these portions, saith Sergius, si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifieth
Christe after his Resurrection: The Seconde, Christe walkinge in the
Earth: The Thirde, Christe lieinge in his Graue. Al this, saith M. Hardinge, is
holy, and Mystical.</p>
               <p>Howe be it, some there were, that liked not so greately these imaginations:
and therefore of them selues diuised others.<note place="margin">Durandus lib. 4. Cap. 53.</note> Some saide, The first parte signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
the Sainctes in Heauen: The Seconde, the Faithful, that be aliue: The
Thirde, the Soules in Purgatorie. Some saie, These thrée partes signifie the
thrée states of Christe, Mortal, Deade, and Immortal: Some, That they signifie
the thrée Substantial partes of Christe, his Godheade, his Soule, and his Bodie:
Some others, that they signifie the thrée Persones in the Trinitie, the Father, the
Sonne, and the Holy Ghost. And I maruel, there was none, that coulde saie, they
signifie the thrée Patriarkes, Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob. Thus, hauing vtterly
lost the very vse of the Breakinge of the Mysteries, they reteine a bare Ceremonie
thereof: and yet are so farre out of knowledge of the same, that they cannot agrée
emonge them selues, what to make of it: I meane, neither what they Breake, nor
wherefore they Breake it. This Sergius disagréeth from Bonauentura, from
Durandus, and al others: yet he liketh M. Hardinge best of al.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And what hurte,</hi> saithe he, <hi>is there herein? Or wherefore shoulde any man herewith be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended?</hi>
Uerily in the House of God, that thinge is hurteful, that doeth no good.
Al the Ceremonies of the Churche ought to be cleare,<note place="margin">1. Corin. 14.</note> and liuely, and hable to edifie.
And if this Mystical Ceremonie be not hurteful, why then doeth M. Hardinge
him self breake it: and that, not of ignorance, or obliuion, but witingly, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly,
and as often as he saith his Masse. For Sergius saith, One of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thrée Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
ought to be reserued vpon the Aultar, vntil the Masse be donne: But M.
Hardinge contrary, bothe to Sergius, and also to his Mystical Significations,
receiueth al the partes togeather, and reserueth none, and that by the Warrant of
the Glose in that place,<note place="margin">De Conse. Dist. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

thus dissemble, and so openly mocke the worlde? If this Ceremonie be good, why
doeth he breake it? If it be yl, why woulde he haue vs to keepe it? The gheasse,
that M. Hardinge vseth herein, seemeth very simple: Pope Sergius diuised these

<hi>The Woorde of God changeth the Kindes of the Elementes:</hi>
                  </hi> And againe, <hi>Ante benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionem
alia Species nominatur: <hi>Before the Consecration it is called an other Kinde.</hi>
                  </hi> In
these and other like places, M. Hardinge cannot wel say, that, <hi>Species,</hi> signifieth
an Accident, or outwarde Shewe.</p>
               <p>Neither doothe this woorde, Uisible, importe any suche External Forme, as is
here imagined: But onely excludeth the Bodie of Christe, whiche is in Heauen,
Inuisible to our Bodily eies, and Uisible onely to the eies of our Faithe. And so
the Water in Baptisme is called, <hi>Forma Visibilis, <hi>a Visible Kinde, or Element,</hi>
                  </hi>
accordinge to the general Definition of al Sacramentes. So S. Augustine saith,

Likewise he saithe,<note place="margin">Augustin. Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur a Beda. 1.</note>

Heauen, we sée it with our Faith, with our minde, and with the eies of our vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standinge.
Neither maie M. Hardinge of this woorde, Inuisible, reason thus, as
he seemeth to doo: <hi>Christes Bodie is Inuisible:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

                     </gap>. lib. 3.</note> For S. Ambrose in like phrase of
woordes, speaketh thus of Baptisme: <hi>Sacri Fontis vnda nos abluit: Sanguis Domini
nos redemit. Alterum igitur Inuisibile, alterum Visibile testimonium Sacramento conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quimur
Spirituali. <hi>The Water of the Holy Fonte hath washed vs: Christes Bloude hath
redeemed vs. Therefore by a Spiritual Sacrament we obteine two Testimonies: the one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisible,
the other Visible.</hi>
                  </hi> Here S. Ambrose saith, <hi>Christes Bloude in Baptisme is Inuisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi>
Yet maie we not conclude thereof, that Christes Bloude is hidden vnder the
Accidentes, or Shewes of Water. So Origen saith, <hi>Baptismus Iohannis videbatur:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Origen. in Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam. homi. 24.</note>

               </p>
               <p>And, notwithstandinge al these thinges be plaine to any man, that hath eies to
see, yet that the weakenes, and folie of these shiftes maie throughly appeare, let
M. Hardinge shewe vs wherein, &amp; in what respecte, his naked Shewe of Formes,
and Accidentes canne be the Sacrament of Christes Bodie. For thus he saith, and
doubleth, and repeteth the same, and maketh it the staie, and grounde of this whole
Treatie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Signe, or Signification of this Sacrament,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cyprian. de Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Domini.</note> 
                  <hi>as S. Cyprian saith, standeth
in Refreashinge, and Feedinge. So saith Rabanus Maurus, <hi>Quia Panis Corporis
Cor confirmat,</hi>
                  </hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rabanus Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus. li. 1. cap. 31.</note> 
                  <hi>ideò ille congruenter Corpus Christi nuncupatur: Et, quia vinum
Sanguinem operatur in Carne, ideò illud ad Sanguinem Christi refertur.</hi> Bicause Breade
confirmeth the harte of the Bodie, therfore it is conueniently called the Bodie of Christe: And
bicause wine woorketh Bloude in the Fleashe, therefore it hath relation to the Bloude of
Christe. <hi>Likewise bicause Water washeth awaie the soile, and filth of the Bodie,
therefore, as Gregorie Nyssene saith,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gregorius Nys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senus De Sancto Baptismate.</note> Christe appointed it to the Sacrament of Baptisme,
to Signifie the Inwarde Wasshinge of our Soules.</p>
               <p>Nowe, although M. Hardinge canne saie many thinges, yet this thinge, I
thinke,<note place="margin">Mar. Antonius Constantius ad obiect. 66.</note> he wil not say, that our Bodies be feadde with his Shewes, and Accidents.
Or, if he so saie, as in deede they are driuen so to saie, then wil the very Natural
Philosopher reprooue his folie. For the Philosopher saith, as in deede true it is,
<hi>Ex ijsdem nutrimur, &amp; sumus. <hi>We consist of the same thinges, wherewith we are nourished.</hi>
                  </hi>
Therefore if M. Hardinge wil saie, The Substance of our Bodie is feadde with
Accidentes: then must he likewise saie, The Substance of our Bodie dooth stande
of Accidentes.</p>
               <p>Hereof we maie very wel reason thus: The Accidentes, or Shewes of Breade,
and Wine feede not our Bodies, as Christes Bodie feedeth our soules:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Accidentes, and Shewes of Breade, and Wine, are not the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
of Christes Bodie.<note place="margin">Cyprian de Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Domini.</note> Contrary wise S. Cyprian, Ireneus, Rabanus, and
other Ancient Fathers saie, The Substance of the Breade feedeth our Bodie, &amp;c.
<hi>Ergo,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Irenaeus. li. 4. ca. 34.</note> The Substance of the Breade is the Sacrament of Christes Bodie.</p>
               <p>And againe, M. Hardinge standinge vpon this simple grounde,<note place="margin">Rabanus. lib. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. Cap. 31.</note> cannot possibly
auoide many greate inconueniences. For if the Shewes, and Accidentes be the
Sacrament, then, for as muche as in one Breade there be many Accidentes, as the
Whitenes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Roundenes, the Breadth, the Taste, &amp;c. and euery such Accident is
a Sacrament, he canne by no Glose, or conueiance shifte him self, but in steede of
one Sacrament, he must needes graunte a number of Sacramentes: &amp; auoidinge
one Figure, he must be driuen to confesse a greate many Figures.</p>
               <p>Touchinge S. Basile, M. Hardinge seemeth to confesse, that his bookes are
disordred, and that nowe sette after Consecration, that sometimes was before:
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:12563:241"/>
and yet he sheweth vs not, who hath wrought this treacherie. I trowe, they haue
corrupted, and falsified their owne bookes.</p>
               <p>But Basile calleth the Sacrament <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, a Samplar, a Signe, or a
Token of Christes Bodie, before the Consecration: and so Damascenus, Euthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius,
and one Epiphanius, and Marcus Ephesius, late writers haue expounded it.
Here, marke wel, good Reader, the Nicenesse, and curiositie of this people without
cause. Sooner then they wil confesse, as the Ancient Catholique Fathers doo,
that the Sacrament is a Figure of Christes Bodie, they are contente to saie: <hi>It is
a Sacrament, before it be a Sacrament: and so a Figure, before it be a Figure.</hi> For howe canne
the Sacrament be a Sacrament, or what canne the bare Breade Signifie before
Consecration? Or who appointed, or commaunded it so to Signifie?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But to leaue these M. Hardinges Newe Fantastical Doctours with their My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical

                  <hi>S. Ambrose in his time thought it no Heresie to write thus:
<hi>Ante Consecrationem alia Species nominatur: Post Consecrationem Corpus Christi Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnificatur.</hi>
                  </hi>
Before Consecration it is called an other Kinde: After Consecration the Bodie of
Christe is Signified. <hi>And againe, <hi>In Edendo, &amp; Potando, Corpus &amp; Sanguinem Christi,
quae pro nobis oblata sunt,</hi>
                  </hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ambrosius. 1. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Significamus. <hi>He saith not, Before Consecration,</hi>
                  </hi> but euen in
receiuinge the Holy Communion, whiche he calleth, Eatinge, and Drinkinge, we Signifie the
Bodie, and Bloude of Christe, that were offered for vs.</p>
               <p>Thus the Olde Fathers called the Sacrament a Signe, or Figure of Christes
Bodie, after it was Consecrate. But before Consecration neither did they euer
calle it so, notwithstandinge these Newe Doctours iudgementes to the contrarie,
nor was there any cause, why they shoulde so calle it. Yet were they not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

               <p>Christ tooke Breade, and blissed it, and brake it, in Figure, or, as Christe
him self vttreth it, in Remembrance of his Blissed, and Unspotted Bodie. But
M. Hardinges Exposition vpon the same is so peruerse, and so wilful, as if it were
frée for him, to glose, and fansie what him listeth. Ephrem saith. <hi>Christ tooke
and brake Breade:</hi> M. Hardinge saith, <hi>Christe brake Formes, and Accidentes, and brake
no Breade.</hi> Ephrem saith, <hi>The Breade is a Figure of Christes Bodie:</hi> M. Hardinge
saith, <hi>The Breade is no Figure of Christes Bodie.</hi> To be shorte, Ephrem saith,
<hi>Christe breake Breade in Figure, or Remembrance of his Bodie:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> saith M. Hardinge, <hi>Christes Bodie is there present, vnder the Forme of Breade.</hi>
Suche regarde hath he to the simplicitie of the people. Certainely Ephrem saith
not, neither that the Formes, or Shewes be broken: nor that the same Formes be
Figures of Christes Bodie: nor that Christes Bodie is presently in them contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
And therefore M. Hardinge in his guileful construction of the same hath

The thinge, that Signifieth, is commonly called by the name of that thinge,
that it Signifieth. <hi>S.</hi> Paule saithe not, The Rocke Signified Christe, but, The Rocke was
Christe, as if the Rocke had beene Christe in deede. Yet was it not so in Substance, and in deede,
but by way of Signification. <hi>Thus therefore saith S. Augustine:</hi> Whiles the Sacrament
is broken, and the Sacrament of Christes Bloude, <hi>(whiche is called Bloude)</hi> is powred into
the mouthes of the Faithful, what thinge els is thereby shewed, but the offering vp of Christes
Bodie vpon the Crosse, and the sheaddinge of his Bloude from his side? <hi>Therefore S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine

               <p>If this place of Tertullian be the chiefe, and of greatest appearance for the

               <p>The woordes be bothe very fewe, and also very plaine. But with this copious
Commentarie of M. Hardinges glosinge, it wil be very harde for the Reader, to

and Substance, but onely the outwarde Formes, and Shewes of Mans
Bodie. Out of whose springes M. Hardinge, and the reste of that side, as it
may appeare, haue drawen their Doctrine of Accidentes standinge without Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecte.
This fonde Heresie Tertullian reprooueth by this reason:</p>
               <p>A Figure of a Bodie, presupposeth a very Natural Bodie: For of a Shewe,
or a Fantasie, there can be no Figure.</p>
               <p>But Christe gaue vnto his Disciples a Figure of his Bodie:</p>

This is my Bodie: That is to saye, This is a Figure of my Bodie. But a Figure it coulde

               </p>
               <p>Nowe, good Reader, marke wel M. Hardinges considerations touchinge the

Yet againe he saithe, <hi>Christes Bodie it selfe may be the Sacrament.</hi> Thirdly he saithe,
<hi>Tertullian ioineth these twoo senses iointely bothe togeather.</hi> And so by his conninge he hath
founde out twoo Sacramentes, in one Sacrament. Al this is M. Hardinges
Glose. For there is not one woorde thereof in the Texte, neither of Accidentes,
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:12563:243"/>
nor of Christes Bodie as beinge a Sacrament of it selfe: nor of this combining<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
of twoo Sacramentes bothe in one. M. Hardinge saithe, <hi>Tertullian speaketh of a
marueilous turninge:</hi> But Tertullian speaketh no suche woorde, neither of Miracle,
nor of turninge. M. Hardinge saithe, <hi>Tertullian speaketh of Holy Outwarde Formes:</hi>
But Tertullian not once nameth any kinde of Formes. By M. Hardinges re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porte,
Tertullian saithe, <hi>Vnder these Holy Formes Christes Bodie is Really Presente:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Tertullian him selfe speaketh nothinge of any Presence. Al these
petite Gloses M. Hardinge hath diuised of his owne, as if it were lawful for a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
man, to examine the Olde learned Fathers vpon the Racke, and to make
them speake, what him listeth.</p>
               <p>Tertullian onely saithe thus, <hi>Christe tooke Breade, and made it his Bodie:</hi> And
bicause these woordes seemed doubteful, and mighte be diuersely taken, he ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
his owne meaninge in this wise: <hi>This is my Bodie: That is to saye, A Figure
of my Bodie.</hi> And touchinge this woorde, <hi>Fecit,</hi> in what sense it is vsed in the
Holy Fathers, I haue spoken at large before in the Tenthe Article, and the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde
Diuision. Yet a little more to open M. Hardinges folie in this behalfe,
whereas in these twoo seueral Propositions, <hi>Hoc est Corpus,</hi> and, <hi>Hoc est Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gura,</hi>
this pronowne, <hi>Hoc,</hi> as Tertullian vseth it, hath relation onely to one
thinge, as if he woulde saie, This Breade is my Bodie: and This Breade is a
Figure: M. Hardinge, to make vp this Newe Construction, contrary bothe to
Tertullians minde, and also to the Natural course of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> woordes, imagineth the
same pronowne, <hi>Hoc,</hi> in the firste place to Signifie one thinge, and in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde
place to Signifie an other thinge: As if Tertullian in the former clause
had written thus, <hi>Hic Panis, <hi>This Breade is my Bodie:</hi>
                  </hi> and in the seconde thus,
<hi>Haec Accidentia, <hi>These Accidentes are a Figure of my Bodie.</hi>
                  </hi> And so, where as these
twoo Propositions shoulde sounde bothe one thinge, the one beinge onely a decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the other, by M. Hardinges Exposition, they are made to sounde twoo
diuerse thinges, the one nothinge like vnto the other. Thus M. Hardinge vseth
the Ancient Fathers, in like sorte, as they saye, Procustes the cruel Gyant was
wonte in olde times to vse his Prisoners: If they be longer, then his measure,
he choppeth them shorter: If they be to shorte, he racketh them longer.</p>
               <p>And where he saithe, The Sacramentes of the Newe Testamente Conteine
Couertly vnder them the thinge it selfe, that they Signifie, and that accordinge
to Christes promisse, Uerily this saieinge Couertly conteineth a greate vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trueth.
For, as he is not hable to allege any Ancient learned Father, that euer
once mentioneth this priuie, and secrete beinge vnder suche Couerte, so is he not
hable to shewe, that Christe euer made him any suche promisse touching the same.
And, notwithstandinge Baptisme be a Sacrament of the Newe Testament, yet
contrary to M. Hardinges Newe Decree, it conteineth not Couertly, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
the thinge, that it Signifieth. True it is, the Newe Sacramentes of
Christes Institution are plainer, and clearer, then the Olde: as the Gospel is
plainer, and clearer, then the Lawe. But the thinges Signified are no more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined
in the one, then in the other. Therefore S. Augustine saithe,<note place="margin">Augustin. in Psalm. 77.</note>

whiche is Really, and Substantially, but Inuisibly vnder the visible forme of the outwarde Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes.
And so Tertullian meaneth by his, That is the Figure of my Bodie, as though Christe had

               <p>Here is imagined an other strange kinde of Figures. For Christes Bodie
it selfe is now become a Figure. But Hilarius saith, <hi>Figura est, quod extrà videtur:
<hi>The Figure is that, is seene outwardly.</hi>
                  </hi> And S. Augustine saith, <hi>Signum est, quod spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciem

                  <hi>A Signe is a thinge, that offereth a sight vnto the eies.</hi> Wherefore,
by M. Hardinges iudgement, Christes very Bodie appeareth outwardely, and is
séene in the Sacrament with our Corporal eies. If so, how then is it there secretly,
as he saide before, and vnder couerte? If not, how then can it be called a Figure?
In confessinge the one, he must needes denie the other. If Christes Bodie be a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,
it is not in Couerte: If it be in couerte, it is not a Figure.</p>
               <p>He wil say, The Accidentes, and shewes are Figures of Christes Bodie there
hidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And againe, The same Bodie so Inuisibly hidden, is a Figure of that Bodie
that died Uisibly vpon the Crosse. Thus, where as others may not once name
any Figure in these cases, it is lawful for M. Hardinge, to heape Figure vpon
Figure: and that not suche Figures as haue beene vsed by any the Ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
but suche as he him selfe for a shift can best diuise.</p>
               <p>Tertullian, saith M. Harding, supposeth, that Christe, when he had y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Breade
in his hande, and saide, <hi>Hoc,</hi> This, shewed onely the Uisible Accidentes, and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
of Breade, as if Christe had saide, <hi>This Whitenesse, this Roundenesse, this Breadth,
this Lightnesse &amp;c. is my Bodye:</hi> By whiche skilful construction it must néedes fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that Christe had a Bodie made of Accidentes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How be it,</hi> (saith M. Hardinge) <hi>this Interpretation of Tertullian in deede is not according
to the right sense of Christes woordes.</hi> Hereby it appeareth what affiance M. Hardinge
hath in the iudgement of this learned Father. After so many faire woordes, he
beginneth vtterly to mislike him, and concludeth in the ende, that he wrote, he
knew not what: and tooke vpon him to expounde Christes woordes, and yet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstoode
not, what Christe meante: and that, not in any deepe Allegorie, or other
Spiritual, or secrete meaning, but euen in the very Literal Sense, and outwarde
sounde of Christes woordes. And thus Tertullian is charged, not onely with Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
but also with Presumption.</p>
               <p>But if, as M. Hardinge saith, Tertullian vnderstoode not Christes meaning,
what if some man woulde likewise say, M. Hardinge vnderstandeth not Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians
meaninge? And what if the simple Reader vnderstande not M. Hardinges
meaninge? It were to muche to say further, M. Hardinge vnderstandeth not his
owne meaninge. Uerily Tertullian not once nameth any one of al these M.

may the better iudge of M. Hardinges owne Exposition. For thus he saith, <hi>VVhen

                  </gap> his fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
(I wil not say, contrary to him selfe) saith, that the Breade is turned into
Christes Bodie, onely at the vtterance of the first Syllable. And so by this Newe
Diuinitie, Christes Bodie is made Present, and the Sacrament is a Sacrament,
before Consecration: &amp; al is ended, before it be begonne: whiche in M. Hardinges
Schooles, not longe sithence, was counted an errour aboue al errours: whiche to
shifte, they were faine to diuise, <hi>Indiuiduum Vagum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, if this Pronowne, <hi>Hoc,</hi> haue relation to Christes Bodie, then must
wee of force by M. Hardinges Fantasie, thus expounde the woordes of Christe:
<hi>This is my Bodie:</hi> that is to say, <hi>My Bodie, is my Bodie:</hi> Whiche Exposition of M.
Hardinges,<note place="margin">In. 4. Sen. quae. 3.</note> D. Holcote saith, is vaine, and peeuish, and to no purpose.</p>
               <p>And, where as M. Harding saith, None of al the Olde Fathers euer expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
these woordes of Christe by a Figure, I maruel, he canne so boldely vtter, and
publishe so greate vntrueth without blusshinge. For he knoweth right wel, that

the first sixe hundred yéeres, and otherwise freight with greate errours, and sundrie
folies. Therefore I thinke it not amisse, for shortenesse of time, to passe them by.
Yet by the way, let vs a litle viewe M. Hardinges Logique. Thus he teacheth vs
to reason: Tertullian by this Pronowne, <hi>Hoc,</hi> vnderstoode the outwarde Accident,

the same by a Substantial, and ful Conclusion. For, to prooue against Marcion
the Heretique, that Christe had the very Substance, and Nature of a mannes Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
he vseth this reason: <hi>A Figure presupposeth the Veritie of a thinge, whereof it is a
Figure: But Christe at his last Supper gaue to his Disciples the Figure of his Bodie: Therefore
Christe had in deede (not a Fantasie, or a Shewe) but a Natural, and a very Bodie.</hi> The force

not ignorantly, or blindely, as M. Hardinge saith, but directly, and orderly,
and accordinge to the Woordes of Christe.</p>
               <p>But, if Tertullian had then benne persuaded of this Priuie, and Secrete Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,

grounded his whole proufe vpon a Figure, then had he, not onely benne ignorant,

owne cause. For, if he had graunted this Newe Fantasie, that the Accidentes
in the Sacrament stande alone without any Subiecte, then had he concluded fully
with Marcion the Heretique, and most directely against him self. For thus woulde
Marcion conclude vpon the same: <hi>The Breade in the Sacrament is Fantastical,</hi> That is
to saie, <hi>It seemeth Breade, and is none: Euen so the Bodie of Christe was Fantastical:

               <p>And where as, for further proufe of Tertullians minde herein, M. Hardinge
hath here alleged certaine woordes of his vnto his wife, vnderstande thou, good
Reader, that wilfully he hath of purpose corrupted the same, the rather to misleade
thy simplicitie. True it is, that the Unfaithful, that knoweth not Christe, if he
happen to sée the Breade of the Holy Mysteries, wil iudge no further of it, but that
he séeth. But what it meaneth, or Signifieth, or vnto what ende it is appointed,
he knoweth not. But the Breade of the Sacramente, by Christes Institution, is
Spiritual, and Heauenly Breade, euen as the Water of Baptisme is Spiritual,
and Heauenly Water. Whiche thinge, as Tertullian saithe, the Infidel cannot
sée. But M. Hardinge, hauinge smal regarde to his Readers iudgement, hath
witingely falsified his Translation, changinge this Article, It, into, <hi>Him,</hi> Onely
of his owne particular wilfulnesse, contrary to al others, Olde, or New: yea con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to his owne Felowes. Of whom one Translateth the same in this wise:
<hi>And if he know it, he beleeueth it to be Breade, and not that, whiche it is saide to be.</hi> No
man may be bolde to woorke suche open Corruption, but M. Hardinge. For,
where as Tertullians woordes be plaine, <hi>Si scierit maritus tuus, Panem esse credet,
non illum (Panem) qui dicitur: <hi>If thy husbande knowe it (beinge an Infidel) he wil be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue
it to be (bare) Breade, but not that (Breade) that it is called,</hi>
                  </hi> M. Hardinge thought
it better to Translate it thus, <hi>He wil beleeue it to be Breade, but not Him, VVho it is called:</hi>
As if it were the personne of a Man. This dealinge, and the whole vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standinge
of Tertullians minde, is opened more at large in the firste Article, and
in the seuenteenth Diuision. Certainely, false Translation maketh no sufficient
proufe.</p>
               <p>Nowe marke thou, good Christian Reader, into howe many, and how nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Grammatical, and Literal sense of Christes woordes. Fourthly, the same Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian
was carried away with heate, and contention, and either knew not, or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

al those thinges that here he hidden, clearely face to face. And where Christe saith, that he wil
drinke his Passeouer new with vs in the kingdome of his Father, Nazianzene so expoundeth that
woorde, New as it may be referred to the manner of the exhibitinge, not to the thinge exhibited.

spritual thinges, and that by bodely seruices heauenly thinges be resembled, and set foorthe. So this,
whiche is at this present receiued, and may of mannes nature be seene, is called an Image. In
this saieinge of Origen this woorde Image, doth not in signification diminishe the truth of thinges,
so as they be not the very thinges in deede, for the thinges that Christe did in Fleashe, were true
thinges: but when they are termed the Image of thinges, thereby is signified, so farre as the condition

               <p>This is most plainely vttered by Oecumenius a Greeke writer, vpon these woordes of <hi>S.</hi> Paule to

yet none of them without the sight of Christe. And as the Iewes were in a Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe,
in comparison of that Brightnes of Lighte, that we sée nowe: euen so are
wée likewise in a Shadowe, in comparison of that Light, that we hope for, and

               <p>In these woordes of <hi>S.</hi> Augustine, we see the fleashe of Christe called a Sacrament of his fleashe,
and the Bloude a Sacramente of his Bloude, in as muche as they be couered with the Forme of Breade
and VVine, yet verily, and in Substance present: And likewise he letteth not to calle this Veritie or
Trueth of the thinges them selues thus couertly exhibited, a Signe of Christes Visible, and Palpable
Bodie: so that the naminge of a Signe dooth not importe a separation from the Trueth, but sheweth
a distincte manner of the Truethe exhibited: And therefore accordinge to the Trueth of the manner
of exhibitinge, it is not the Fleashe of Christe, but the Sacrament of the Fleashe of Christe, for that

Fleashe, Inuisible, Spiritual, and onely to be conceiued by vnderstandinge.

saith thus:<note place="margin">Augustin. in Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han. tractat. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>Quod pertinet ad Virtutem Sacramenti, non quod pertinet ad visibile Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum.

                  </hi> Likewise he saith of Moses, Aaron, and Phinees, and others
the Faithful of that time: <hi>Visibile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cibum (Manna) Spiritualiter intellexerunt. Spiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liter

                  </hi> By these woordes, <hi>Intus,</hi>

the meaninge of this woorde, <hi>Inuisibiliter,</hi> Inuisibly. Therefore Chrysostome

               <p>As it is the Mysterie of Baptisme, so is it also in the Mysterie of Christes

That Heauenly Breade, whereof he speaketh, is a Sacrament. But the very Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die

                  </hi> But the Bodie of Christe, that M. Hardinge
imagineth to be Present, cannot be seene: For S. Augustine saith, it is Spiritual,

Breade, that is here mentioned by S. Augustine.</p>
               <p>Moreouer S. Augustine saith, <hi>The same Heauenly Breade is the Bodie of

or Kinde of speache.</hi>
                  </hi> But Christes very Bodie, is in deede, and Uerily, in al respec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
the Bodie of Christe, without any suche qualifieinge, or limitation. And it

Fleashe is geuen to be eaten, other beside that, whiche was Crucified. VVherefore in respecte of the
exhibitinge, the Fleashe is diuided, that in it selfe is but one: and the Fleashe exhibited in mysterie,
is in very deede a Sacrament of Christes Bodie visible, and palpable, whiche suffered on the Crosse.
And thus it foloweth of conuenience, where as the Fleashe is not the same accordinge to the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the exhibitinge, whiche was Crucified, and whiche nowe is sacrificed by the handes of a
Prieste: againe, where as the Passion, Death, and Resurrection are saide to be done, not in trueth of
the thinge, but in mysterie Signifieinge: it foloweth (<hi>I</hi> saie) that the Fleashe is not the same in qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
so as it was on the Crosse, though it be the same in substance.</p>
               <p>Many mo authorities might be alleged for the openinge of this mater, but these for this present
are ynough, if they be not to many, as I feare me, they wil so appeare to the vnlearned Reader, and
to suche as be not geuen to earnest studie, and diligent searche of the truethe. By these places it is
made cleare, and euident, that these Names, Figure, Image, Signe, Token, Sacrament, and suche other
the like, of force of their signification doo not alwaies exclude the trueth of thinges: but doo onely
shewe, and note the maner of presence. VVherefore, to conclude this maier, that is somewhat ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
to senses litle exercised, the Figure of the Bodie, or Signe of the Bodie, the Image of the Bodie,
dothe note the coouertnes, and secretenes in the maner of the exhibitinge, and doth not diminishe any
whitte the truethe of the presence. So we doo accorde with M. Iuel in this Article touchinge the
forme of woordes, but withal we haue thought it necessarie, to declare the true meaninge of the
same, whiche is contrarie to the doctrine of the Sacramentaries.</p>

               <p>M. Hardinge, as in his woordes he pretendeth greate stoare of authorities, so
in his choise he bewraieth greate wante. For, to passe by the place of S. Hierome,
whiche is answeared before in the fifthe Article, and .7. Diuision, the woordes of
S. Augustine seeme vtterly to ouerthrowe al these his grosse, and Fleashely Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasies.
For better vnderstandinge whereof, it is to be noted, that, when Christe
had opened that Heauenly Doctrine of the Eatinge of his Bodie, and Drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge
of his Bloude, the Capernaites hearinge his woordes, imagined, euen as M.
Hardinge nowe dooth, that he meante a very Fleashly Eatinge with their Bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mouthes: and therefore beganne to be offended, and saide, His speache was ouer
harde, and departed from him. Upon occasion hereof, S. Augustine writeth thus,
<hi>Ipsi erant duri, non sermo. Christus instruxit eos, qui remanserant, &amp; ait illis: Spiritus est,
qui viuificat: Caro autem nihil prodest. Verba, quae locutus sum vobis, Spiritus sunt, &amp; vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta.
Spiritualiter intelligite, quod locutus sum. Non hoc Corpus, quod videtis, manducatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri
estis, nec bibituri illum Sanguinem, quem fusuri sunt, qui me Crucifigent. Sacramentum
aliquod vobis commendaui: Spiritualiter intellectum viuificabit vos. <hi>They were harde:
Christes woorde was not harde. Christe instructed them, that remained, and saide vnto them, it
is the Sprite, that geueth life, the Fleashe profiteth nothinge. The woordes, that I haue spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
are Sprite, and Life. Vnderstande ye spiritually, that I haue spoken. Ye shal not Eate this
Bodie, that ye see: neither shal ye drinke that Bloude, that they shal sheadde, that shal Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
me. I haue recommended vnto you a certaine Sacrament: Beinge Spiritually vnderstanded,
it wil geue you life.</hi>
                  </hi> These woordes be plaine of them selfe, and neede no longe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="475" facs="tcp:12563:253"/>The difference, that M. Hardinge hath diuised bytweene Christes Bodie in
Substance, and the self same Bodie in respecte of qualities, is a vaine Glose of his
owne, without Substance. For S. Augustine saith not, as M. Hardinge woulde
faine haue him to saie, Ye shal not Eate this Bodie (with your bodily mouth)
<hi>Quale videtis,</hi> vnder suche Conditions, and qualities of Mortalitie, and Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as yowe nowe see it: but, <hi>Quod videtis,</hi> that is, Yowe shal not eate the same
Bodie in Nature, and Substance, that nowe ye sée.</p>
               <p>Neither was the Bodie of Christe at that time, when he Ministred the holy
Communion, and spake these woordes to his Disciples, endewed with any suche
qualities. For it was neither Spiritual, nor Inuisible, nor Immortal: but contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rywise,
Earthly, Uisible, and subiecte to Death.</p>
               <p>To be shorte, S. Augustine speaketh not one woorde, neither of this Carnal
Presence: nor of Secrete Beinge vnder Couerte: nor saith, as M. Hardinge saithe,
that the very Bodie of Christe is a Figure of Christes Bodie: nor imagineth in
Christe two sundrie sortes of Natural Bodies: nor knoweth any one of al these M.
Hardinges strange Collections. Thus onely he saith, <hi>Non hoc Corpus, quod vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,
manducaturi estis:</hi> Touchinge your Bodily mouth, <hi>Ye shal not Eate this Bodie of
mine, that ye see.</hi> Of whiche woordes M. Hardinge, contrary to S. Augustines ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse,
and plaine meaninge, as his common wonte is, concludeth the contrary:
<hi>Ergo, <hi>with youre Bodily Mouth, ye shal eate this self same Bodie in Substance, that
ye see.</hi>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nowe, for as muche as M. Hardinge wil saie, Wée diuise Figures of our sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
without cause, and that Christes woordes are plaine, and ought simply to be
taken, as they sounde, without any manner Figure, I thinke it therefore necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
in fewe woordes to shewe, bothe what hath leadde vs, and al the Ancient Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and Olde Doctours of the Churche, thus to expounde the Woordes of Christ:
and also, howe many, and howe strange, and monstrous Figures M. Hardinge
with his Bretherne are driuen to vse in the Exposition of the same. And to passe
ouer al the Olde learned Fathers, whiche in their writinges commonly cal the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
a Representation, a Remembrance, a Memorie, an Image, a Likenes, a
Samplar, a Token, a Signe, and a Figure, &amp;c. Christe him self before al others,
seemeth to leade vs hereunto, bothe for that at the very Institution of the holy My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
he saide thus, <hi>Doo ye this in Remembrance of me:</hi> And also, for that in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
sixth Chapter of S. Iohn, speakinge of the Eatinge of his Fleashe, he forewarned <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
his Disciples of his Ascension into Heauen, and shewed them, that his very Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
Fleashe, Fleashely receiued, canne profite nothinge.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, it is not agréeable, neither to the Nature of a Man, Really, and in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
deede to eate a mannes Bodie: nor to a mannes Bodie, Really, and in deede, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Figure, to be Eaten. For that, S. Augustine saith, were <hi>Flagitium, &amp; facinus:
<hi>An horrible wickednes.</hi>

               <p>Againe, in these woordes of Christe we finde <hi>Duo disparata,</hi> that is, two sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> My Bodie, that Is geuen, that Is broken: in steede of, That Shalbe geuen, and
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> That Shalbe broken, is a Figure. <hi>I am Breade:</hi> Christe Really, and in deede, was

deede, and verily is not the Newe Testament: Therefore it is a Figure. In euery
of these Clauses M. Hardinge must needes see, and confesse a Figure: and so it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth,
that in the very Institution of Christes Holy Mysteries, there are vsed a
greate many, and sundrie Figures: al notwithstandinge, both consonant to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,

               <p>But nowe, marke wel, I beseeche thée, good Christian Reader, howe many, and
what kindes of Figures, M. Hardinge, and the reste of his companie haue benne

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, they saie, This pronowne, <hi>Hoc, <hi>This,</hi>
                  </hi> signifieth not, <hi>This Breade,</hi> as al
the Olde Writers vnderstande it, but, <hi>Indiuiduum Vagu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> whiche is neither Breade,

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> This Uerbe, <hi>Est,</hi> They expounde thus, <hi>Est, hoc est, Transubstantiatur:</hi> Suche a

               <p>In these four woordes lieinge in order al togeather, He Tooke, He Blissed,

                  </hi> They haue founde a swarme
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> of Figures. Sometimes they saie, It is called Breade, bicause it was Breade be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> Sometimes, bicause the Infidel taketh it to be Breade: Sometimes, bicause
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> there remaine stil the Accidentes, and Formes of Breade: Sometimes, bicause
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> the same Accidentes feede the Bodie miraculousely, as if it were Breade. Someti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,

               <p>
                  <hi>Likewise in this one woorde,</hi> Frangimus, <hi>or</hi> Frangitur, <hi>they haue a number of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> Figures. For sometimes they expounde it thus, <hi>The Breade, that we Breake:</hi> that

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> In these woordes, <hi>Non bibam amplius de hoc fructu vitis, <hi>I wil drinke no more of

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/>
                  <hi>Concomitantia,</hi> whereby one is made two, and two are made one: Consider,
good Reader, the strangenes of the Figures, and the wonderful shiftes, that M.
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:12563:254"/>
Hardinge hath imagined in this litle treatie, to defeate, and auoide the manifest
woordes of the Holy Fathers. Sometimes the Formes, and Accidentes are the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/>
Sacrament: Sometimes Christes Bodie it selfe is the Sacrament: Sometimes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22"/>
Both togeather are the Sacrament: Sometimes the Breade is a Figure of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23"/>
Bodie, before Consecration: And so by meane of M. Hardinges Figures, there <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24"/>
is a Sacrament, before it be a Sacrament: and a Figure, before it be a Figure.
Sometimes, the Holy Accidentes, and outwarde Holy Shewes, are a Figure of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/>
Christes Bodie Inuisible, vnder them secretely conteined: Sometimes the same <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="26"/>
Bodie Inuisible, is a Figure of the Bodie of Christe Uisible. And so there is Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
vpon Figure: and a kinde of demonstration, whiche they calle, <hi>Notum per
ignotum:</hi> Or rather, <hi>Verum per Falsum:</hi> Sometimes, the Sacrament is a Figure of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="27"/>
the life to come: And sometimes, as Hosius fansieth, it is a Figure of the Churche.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="28"/>
Sometimes Tertullian vnderstoode not, no not so much as the Gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>matical sense of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="29"/>
Christes Woordes: Sometimes Christes Uery Bodie is not Aptly, and Fitly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/>
called the Bodie of Christe, but onely <hi>Impropriè,</hi> and <hi>After a manner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus M. Hardinge rometh, and wandereth vp, and downe, as a man that had
loste his waie: Suche shadowes, and coloures he canne caste: Into so many for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,
and shapes, and figures he canne turne him self. So many, and so monstrous
Figures maie he forge in the Institution of the Holy Sacramente, onely to auoide
one simple, plaine, vsual, and knowen Figure. And yet he abuseth not the simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie
of the people. There he forceth his Figures, where as is no neede of Figures:
And without suche vaine Figures this vaine Doctrine cannot holde. That one
Figure, that we vse, is plaine, and cleare, vsed by al the Ancient learned Fathers,
and agréeable to the tenoure of Goddes Woorde. But M. Hardinges Figures, as
they be many, so be they vnnecessarie, and Fantastical, neuer vsed, or once mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by any Ancient Doctoure of the Churche, and serue onely to breede darkenes,
and to dimme the light.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Howe muche better were it for him, to leaue these shiftes, and childishe fables,

with the Priest,<note place="margin">Canones Apost. can. 9.</note> that Ministred, it is plaine by the Canons of the Apostles, and by
sundrie other good Authorities, which now I purposely passe by. And to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it is written thus, in a litle booke set abroade vnder the name of S. Hierome:
<hi>Non debet Episcopus repudiare Eucharistiam Presbyteri:</hi>

yet wil they saie seueral Masses, at sundrie Aultars. And not onely thus,
but also,<note place="margin">Concil. Toletan. 12. Ca. 5.</note> as it appeareth by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Councel of Toledo in Spaine, one Priest hath some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

For thus they haue decreed: <hi>Presbyter in die non amplius, quàm tres Missas ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrare

And if they be, shal they not seeme reiected, and put from their deuotion? VVhich inconuenience that

to the cause, and also woorthily suspected of greate vntrueth. For that

Bishop,<note place="margin">Superbum, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogans, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christianum.</note> and saith, It was a Proude, and a Glorious Title, and meete for Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christe.
Where as Leo saithe, <hi>The aftercommers should seeme reiected,</hi> he meaneth,
from the receiuinge of the Holy Communion, and not, as M. Hardinge imagineth,
from the hearinge of Masse. And here wée haue by the way specially to note
these woordes of Leo: <hi>Sacrificium offerre non possunt.</hi> By whiche woordes Leo tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
vs plainely, that the Sacrifice, whereof M. Hardinge maketh so greate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coumpte,
is offered no lesse by the People, then by the Priest.</p>
               <p>And, where as M. Hardinge noteth further, that this Latine woorde, <hi>Iteretur,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iteretur.</note>
may stande as wel with three, or foure, or moe Masses, as with twoo, whiche

importeth likewise one, and the selfe same Minister, and none other. For if

that one Communion was then in suche cases ministred successiuely, and in
order after an other: and not twoo Masses, or thrée, or foure, or sixe, or tenne togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
al at once, as the manner is now in the Churche of Rome.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hereof M. Hardinge frameth vs this formal</hi> Syllogismus: The cause, that mooued
Leo to take this order, was, that al, and euery of the deuoute people might heare Masse: But it is
likely, the people resorted to the Churche at sundrie times, some rather, some later, and not al at once:
<hi>Ergo,</hi> It is likely, that to satisfie the peoples deuotion, there were sundrie Masses saide in one day.</p>
               <p>It is likely, that M. Hardinge neuer examined the partes, and likelyhoode of
this Argument. For first the <hi>Maior,</hi> or Head Proposition is apparent false,
grounded, as it is termed in Logique, <hi>A non causa, vt causa,</hi> Presuming, that thing
to be the cause, whiche in déede is no cause. For the cause, that mooued Leo, was
not the hearinge of Masse, as it is already prooued, but the receiuinge of the Holy
Communion.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Minor,</hi> or Seconde Proposition, notwithstandinge in some parte it may
seeme true, yet it is nothinge agréeable to Leoes meaning. For Leo speaketh
not of one man, or twoo, nor of the ordinarie course of euery daye, but onely of
greate Solemne Feastes, and of suche resorte of people, as might fil vp the whole
Churche. His woordes be plaine, <hi>Cùm solennior Festiuitas conuentum populi nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merosioris
indixerit:</hi> And, <hi>Quoties Basilicam praesentia nouae plebis impleuerit.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
to beare vs thus in hande, that Leo had suche a special care, either for the
Terme time in London, or for the people aboute Paules, or for hearinge the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stels
masse, it is a very vaine, and a childishe fantasie: like as this also is, that he
addeth, The people should be denied that Spiritual Comforte. For, alas, what
Comforte can the people receiue, where as they can neither see, nor heare, nor vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande,
nor know, nor learne: but stande onely as men amased, vtterly berefte
of al their senses? Let M. Hardinge once lay aparte dissimulation, and tel vs,
by what waies, or meanes, the people at his Masse can possibly receiue this Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Comforte. If he woulde speake truely, and that he knoweth, as he sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
dooth, he shoulde rather cal it Spiritual Blindenesse.</p>
               <p>And, where as he pleadeth his <hi>to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e, and haue had
lesse occasion, to deceiue the people. For Leo saithe not, as M. Hardinge woulde
force him to say, <hi>As often as any deuoute people cometh to Churche,</hi> but, as it is saide
before, <hi>Quoties Basilicam praesentia nouae plebis impleuerit: <hi>As often as the presence of
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> newe companie shal haue filled vp the whole Churche.</hi>
                  </hi> In suche cases it was lawful to
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:12563:258"/>
beginne againe the whole Communion, and not otherwise. By these woordes,
M. Hardinges <hi>Totquot</hi> is muche abbridged.</p>
               <p>In the ende he concludeth, not onely against Leo his Authour, but also against
the very expresse order of his owne Churche, <hi>That one Priest,</hi> (for Leo speaketh one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of one, and of no moe) <hi>may say Masse boldely without stickinge, or staggeringe, as often
as any people resorteth to him.</hi> For, now it is thought sufficient for one Priest, to saie
one Masse vpon one day, and no moe. So it is determined by Pope Alexander,
<hi>Sufficit Sacerdoti vnam Missam in vno die celebrare. <hi>It is sufficient for a Prieste to say one
Masse vpon a day.</hi>

to M. Hardinges Newe Canon, they are vtterly leafte without their Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual

woulde not haue Decreed,<note place="margin">M. Hardinge groundeth his gheasse vvithout his compasse. For this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel vvas holden Anno. 613.</note> that it shoulde not be lawful to celebrate two Masses vpon one Aultare in
one daye: neither, where the Bishop had saide Masse, that a Priest might not saye the same daye, at the
same Aultar. For beside that the prohibition presupposeth, the thinge prohibited to haue beene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
vsed, (elles prohibition had bene superfluous, and so farre foorthe it appeareth, that before the
makinge of that Decree mo Masses were saide at one Aultar in one daye) the argument of this Decree
serueth verie wel for proufe, that by force of this Councel it was then lawful to saye moe Masses in
one Churche in one daye. For this prohibition of the Councel is not general, but especial, restricted
to a particular place of the Churche, <hi>in vno Altario,</hi> at one Aultar, whiche includeth not of anye
reason a more general, and larger mater, then it selfe, as neither at any other Aultar in the same
Churche the same daie it shalbe lawful to saye Masse: but of consequent this beinge but one special
case forbidden, inferreth a permission, and good leaue in the reast <hi>eiusdem generis, &amp; subiecti,</hi>
that be of the same kinde, and aboute the same mater, and not included by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> woordes of reason in that
prohibition. So that wee maye not argue by reason in this sorte, It is forbidden to saye moe Masses
at one Aultar in one daye, <hi>Ergo,</hi> It is forbidden to saye many Masses at al in one Churche, in one
daye, vpon diuerse Aultars: but the contrary reason folowethe, <hi>Ergo,</hi> ye maye saye many Masses,
vpon diuers Aultars in one daye. And likewise, ye maye not saye Masse that daye on the Aultar where
the Bishoppe hathe saide, <hi>Ergo,</hi> ye maye lawfully saye at an other Aultar: For otherwise the lawe
woulde haue forbidden generally, ye shal not saye Masse in the Churche where the Bishoppe hath

vncertaine, and therefore sometimes vntrue: and for that cause may not alwaies
stande of necessitie, as mater of iudgement. The Greeke Churche neuer vsed the

the Holy Communion, sauinge onely at one time in the yéere, when also
shée vseth it with foule disorder, and, as Gelasius saith, with open Sacrilege, and

deliteth to cal it, one Masse in one Daie: But the Latine Churche, that nowe
is, hath in euery Corner of the Temple erected Aultars, and therefore nowe is ful
of Corner Masses. In the Olde Latine Churche it was not lawful, to saie the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde
Communion, but onely when the Churche was ful of people: In M. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinges
Newe Latine Churche, there be oftentimes moe Masses saide togeather,
then there be hearers of the people, to gase vpon them. Thus the iudgement of the

not receiue the grace of the Holy Communion so many times, howe many Sacrifices they seeme to offer

onely at the last Oblation of the Sacrifice, as though they ought not so oftentimes to be partakers of
that true and singular Sacrifice, as the Sacrifice of the Bodie and Bloude of our Lorde Iesus Christ
hath beene doone. For beholde the Apostle saithe, Be not they, whiche eate Sacrifices,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.</note> partakers of

of the Bodie and Bloude of Christe our Lorde offered on the Aultar, (for so be their woordes) where

of our Lorde. Thus muche graunted, as by any reasonable vnderstandinge it cannot be drawen, nor
by racking can be stretched to any other sense: wee haue here good auctoritie for the hauing of many
Masses in one Churche in one daye. And, where as the Fathers of that Councel allowed many Masses
in one daye saide by one Prieste, there is no reason, why they shoulde not allowe the same saide by
sundry priestes in one daye. If our aduersaries saye, this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

is it the Uine of the God of Sabaoth. Notwithstandinge the Filde lie waste, and

Labourers to reare vp, and to dresse his Uine: to laboure, &amp; to weede his Grounde:
to geather in, and to feede his Flocke.</p>
               <p>This allegation of the Councel of Toledo serueth M. Hardinge, onely to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traie
his want. For if he could haue founde any other Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel of antiquitie, I trow,
he woulde not haue alleged this. It was holden welneare seuen hundred yeeres
after Christe: by which time many greate disorders, and deformities were priuily
cropen into the Churche, as maie appeare both otherwise, and also by this same
example, that one Priest vsed then to saie many Masses in one daie, and yet him
selfe not to Communicate, contrary both to the Institution of Christe, &amp; also to the
Lawes, and Canons of the Churche:<note place="margin">De Cons. Dist. 2. Relatum est in Glosa.</note> and therefore the Glose vpon the Decrees
calleth it a most Naughty Custome: and this Councel it selfe saith, Who so euer
so dooth, is gilty of the Lordes Sacrament. Thus both the computatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the time,
and also the disorder, and abuse of the thinge it self considered, this Authoritie nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
no further answeare.</p>
               <p>It was impertenent in this place for M. Hardinge, to moue mater of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.
How be it for shorte answeare thereto, the Sacrifice, that in the Olde Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
is called, Daily, is that euerlastinge, and onely Sacrifice,<note place="margin">Hebrae. 10.</note> that Christe once of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
vpon the Crosse, beinge there a Priest for euer, according to the order of Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisedech:
and, who so euer thinketh not that Sacrifice sufficient, but imagineth
some other Sacrifice for sinnes to be made by man, is an enimie of the Crosse of
Christe, and of his Sacrifice, and treadeth downe the So<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne of God vnder his feete,<note place="margin">Philippen. 3. Hebrae. 10.</note>
and counteth the Bloude of the Testament to be vnholy. In what sense the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie
of the Holy Communion is of the Olde Fathers called a Sacrifice, it shalbe
shewed at large in the seuenteenth Article hereof, seruinge wholy to that purpose.</p>
               <p>Touchinge this woorde, <hi>Missa,</hi> neither is the name, nor the meaninge thereof
of suche Antiquitie, as it is here supposed by M. Hardinge. It grewe first in vse
aboute foure hundred yeeres after Christe, &amp; is very seldome vsed of the Olde La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine

Lactantius, and others of that age, neuer: vnto S. Chrysostome, S. Basile, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianzene,
Gregorie Nyssene, and al other Greeke writers, vtterly vnknowen. It
is founde in two sundrie places vnder the name of S. Augustine,<note place="margin">August. in Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the name of S. Hierome. But it is certaine, that these bookes were neither S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustines,
nor S. Hieromes.</p>
               <p>Howe be it,<note place="margin">Hieronym. in Prouerb.</note> we make no greate accoumpte of the name. The natural sense, and
meaninge thereof, contrary to M. Hardinges surmises, necessarily importeth a
Communion, and not a priuate Masse. For this Latine woorde, <hi>Missa,</hi> is as muche
as, <hi>Missio,</hi> that is, a commaundinge awaie, or licence to departe.<note place="margin">Cyprian. lib. 3. Epistolar.</note> So S. Cyprian
saith, <hi>Remissa peccatorum,</hi> in steede of <hi>Remissio:</hi> And the order of the Churche then
was this, That Nouices, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were not yet Christened, &amp; were called <hi>Catechumeni,</hi> &amp;
others, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were called <hi>Poenitentes,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> for some offence were inioyned to doo penance,
notwithstanding they might lawfully heare the Sermons, &amp; praie togeather with
the reaste, yet might they neither be present at the Baptisme, nor receiue the Holy
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:12563:262"/>
Mysteries. And therefore, after the Gospel was read, and the Sermon ended, the
Deacon saide vnto them, <hi>Ite, Missa est. <hi>Goe ye hence: Ye maie departe.</hi>
                  </hi> Likewise in S.
Gregories time the Deacon vsed thus to saie,<note place="margin">Gregorius Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logor. li. 2. ca. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>Qui non communicat, det locum: <hi>Who
so dooth not Communicate, let him geue place.</hi>
                  </hi> Thus al they, that either woulde not, or
might not Communicate with the rest of their brethren, were willed to departe:
whereof it necessarily foloweth, that al they, that remained, did Communicate.</p>
               <p>Of this departure away, and Proclamation of the Deacon, the action it selfe,
whiche was the holy Communion, was called <hi>Missa.</hi> Afterwarde, when either
through negligence of the people, or through auarice of the Priestes, the whole or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
hereof was quite altered, and the thing, that had beene Common, was become
Priuate, yet, as it happeneth often in other the like thinges, the former name re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
stil. For example, The Uigilles, or Night Watches, were tourned into
Fastinges: Aultars, that serued for offeringe vp of Calues, and Goates, were tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
into the Lordes Table: The Sabaothe day was turned into the Sunday.</p>
               <p>Yet, the thinges beinge thus altered, the names notwithstandinge of Uigilles,
Aultars, and Sabaothe daies remaine stil in vse, as they did before. Therfore M.
Hardinge herein, as commonly elswhere, thought it best, to deceiue his Reader, by
the mistakinge, and errour of the Name.</p>
               <p>Last of al, if the Fathers in the Councel of Toledo, and Leo meante al one
thinge, as here it is constantly auouched, then is M. Hardinge by the same Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
but poorely reliued. For it is most euident, by that is already saide, that Leo
meante the Holy Communion, and not M. Hardinges Priuate Masse.</p>

               <p>If <hi>M.</hi> Iuel agnise and accepte for good the authoritie of this Councel, as the Churche dooth, then
must he allow these many thinges, whiche he, and the Sacramentaries to the vttermost of their
power and cunninge, labour to disproue, and deface. First, the blessed Sacrifice of the Masse, whiche
the Fathers of this Councel cal the true and singular Sacrifice, the Sacrifice of the Bodie and bloud of
our Lorde Iesus Christe, whiche the Priest offereth on the aultar. Next, the trueth, and real presence
of the Bodie and Bloud of our Lorde in the Sacrifice offered. Then Aultars, whiche this Councel
calleth diuine or holy, for the diuine and holy thinges on them offered, the Bodie and Bloud of Christ.
Furthermore, the (200)<note place="margin">The .200. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trueth. For M. Harding vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth not his ovvne booke: as it shal appeare.</note> multitude of Masses in one day. For they speake of many Sacrifices, that is,
many Masses, <hi>Plurima Sacrificia.</hi> Lastly, Priuate Masses. For the woordes, <hi>nec ipse Sacrificans,</hi>
rightly construed and weighed, importe no lesse. For where as no woorde in this Decree is vttered,
whereby it may appeare, the people to be of necessitie required to receiue, if the Priestes had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
them selues at euery Masse, no faulte had beene founde. And if the people had receiued without
the Priestes, in this case it had been reason, this Decree should otherwise haue been expressed. And so
it is cleare, that at that time Priuate Masses were saide and doone.</p>

               <p>Now, good Christian Reader, that thou maiste sée, how vainely M. Hardinge
hath wandred throughout this whole treatie, it may please thée, to remember my
first Negatiue Proposition touchinge the same, whiche in effect is this: They are
not hable to shewe, that within sixe hundred yeeres after Christe, there were fiue
Masses saide anywhere, in any one Church, in one daie, throughout the worlde.</p>
               <p>In whiche proposition twoo pointes are specially touched: the number of Masses,
and the number of yéeres. To prooue the Affirmatiue hereof, M. Hardinge hath
alleged the Councel of Antisiodorum,<note place="margin">Anno. 614.</note> and the Councel of Toledo, either of them
beinge without the compasse of sixe hundred yéeres.<note place="margin">Anno 680.</note> He hath also alleged Leo an
ancient Bishop of Rome,<note place="margin">Leo Epis. 81.</note> speakinge onely of the Holy Communion, and not one
woorde of the Priuate Masse.<note place="margin">De Conse. dist. 2.</note> Al these thrée Authorities touche onely one Prieste,

Thus hath M. Hardinge failed, bothe in the computation of the yéeres, and also in
the number of his Masses.</p>
               <p>Yet must this be defended emonge the reste, bee the profanation thereof neuer
so horrible: and, who so euer dare wishe a reformation herein, muste be no better,
then a Heathen, and a Publicane. O, how muche better had it béene for M. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge,

               <p>This Article of Images may be easily passed ouer, bothe for that the weight
thereof is not great, and also for that M. Hardinge, as his woonte is, hath purpose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dissembled the mater, that was in question, and diuised other fantasies, that
were not touched. Wherein, notwithstandinge he vse large discourses, and make
great shewe, yet in the ende, as it shal appeare, he concludeth nothinge. I graunt,
Images were erected in some Churches within sixe hundred yéeres after Christe,
al be it neither so rathe, as it is pretended, nor without muche repininge of Godly
men, and great contention.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But M. Hardinge, of his modestie, once againe calleth vs</hi> Newe Maisters: <hi>so as he
woulde cal Moses, if he were now aliue, or muche rather God him selfe. For this
Doctrine is Goddes Doctrine, and not ours. And therefore S. Augustine saithe,
<hi>Huiusmodi Simulachrum Deo nefas est in Christiano Templo collocare:</hi>

                  <note place="margin">August. de Fide. &amp; Symbolo. Ca. 7.</note> In a Christian

and contrary to Christian Religion: Vnmeete for the Churche of Christe, and vnmeete for the
people of God. <hi>How be it, M. Hardinge perhaps wil suffer these twoo, to passe in
the numbre of his</hi> Newe Maisters.</p>
               <p>And, al be it by these Fathers iudgement, it is plaine, that by settinge vp of
Images Goddes Commaundement is broken, yet yt may the better appeare by
comparinge Goddes Woordes, and M. Hardinges Woordes bothe togeather. God
saithe, <hi>Thou shalt make to thee selfe no grauen Image:</hi> M. Hardinge saithe, <hi>Thou shalt

iudge thou, good Reader, whether this be a breache of Gods Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement, or no.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="497" facs="tcp:12563:264"/>Uerily M. Hardinge in the first entrie hereof saith thus,<note place="margin">The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of Images.</note> 
                  <hi>Images are not specially
set vp, to thintent the people maie woorship them.</hi> The sense whereof must needes be
this: <hi>Images are set vp to thend to be woorshipped: althoughe not specially to that ende.</hi>
But an Image is a Creature, and no God: And to honour a Creature in that sort,
is Idolatrie: Therefore, by M. Hardinges owne confession, Images are set vp to
be vsed to Idolatrie: althoughe not Specially to that ende. How be it by this sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
Distinction of General, and Special, Idolatrie is easy to be excused.</p>

no Images. Againe the same Crosses were abroade in other places, in the Aire,
in the Fielde, in the Labourers Coates, in priuate houses, and in mens purses: and
not set vp in any Temple, as it is plaine by that is already spoken. To be short, it

               <p>I trowe, This good Olde Monumente of Antiquitie hath laine longe in the
dust at Uerona, with M. Hardinges Amphilochius. The Churche piteously be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moaneth
her selfe vnto Christe, that she is soare persecuted, and vexed for his I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage.
Christe to comforte her with al, saith, Who so denieth mine Image, shal
be denied before my Father. In the ende he confirmeth the vse of suche Images
by the Example of the Cherubines.</p>
               <p>Here M. Hardinge, to increase some credite to his new Doctour, shoulde haue
shewed vs, when the Churche was thus vexed, for hauinge the Image of Christe,
and whoo vexed her, and what kinde of vexation it was, and how longe it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed,
and in what countrie, and when it ceassed. The Churche is builte vpon
a Mounte: her Persequutions cannot be hidden. If she euer were thus vexed, for
hauinge of Images, I meane before the time of Athanasius, it must néedes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare:
If neuer, then was she a very Wanton, thus to complaine without cause.</p>
               <p>If these threates be true, that who so denieth the grauen, or painted Image of
Christe, shalbe denied before God the Father, then must Epiphanius the Bishop
of Cyprus, and Serenus the Bishop of Massilia, both Godly, and Zelous Bishops,
and a greate number of other godly Learned Fathers, that rente, &amp; brake downe,
and defaced Christes Images, be vtterly denied before God. To be shorte, to say,
that God commaunded Moyses, to make the golden Cherubines, purposely to be
Figures of these Images of Wood, or Stoane, it is a very Fabulous, and a Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish
fantasie, without any grounde: how be it, good yenough to mainteine, and
colour a Childishe Doctrine.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding, if there be any weight either in this hidden Athanasius, or
in his sayeinges, then may wee wel coniecture, that he vseth this Worde Image
in this place, not for any suche material forme painted, or grauen by mans hande,
but for the whole Conuersation of the Sonne of God in this mortal life, whiche
is as muche as, <hi>Verbum Caro factum est: <hi>The woorde became Fleashe:</hi>
                  </hi> and is expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,

Faithe.<note place="margin">2 Corin. 4. Iohan. 1.</note> And thus <hi>S.</hi> Paule saithe, <hi>Christus est Imago patris, <hi>Christe is the Image of

Images, and that openly to the example of others, M. Hardinge knoweth, this

<hi>Wee may learne more in a shorte while by an Image, then by longe studie, and trauaile in the

a Storie written. But the comparison, that M. Hardinge vseth betweene Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerie,

M. Hardinges comparison of Painters, and Poetes may wel be allowed.</p>
               <p>How be it, this séemeth to be no very handsome way, to teache the people. Of
their Priestes, they haue made Images: and of their Images, they haue made
Priestes. For their Priestes, for the more parte, haue Eies, and sée not: haue
Eares, and heare not: Hartes, and vnderstande not: Mouthes, and speake not:
in al respectes euen like vnto their Images. Their Images haue no Eies, and
yet are made to see: haue no Eares, and yet are made to heare: haue no Mouthes,
and yet are set vp to speake: and so in these respectes doo the Dewties, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine
to Priestes. Thus they barre the People from the hearinge of Goddes holy
Woorde: and bid them goe, and looke vpon their Images: to talke with their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages:
to heare their Images: and to learne of their Images.</p>
               <p>And, although perhaps the people may happily learne somewhat by these mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
yet is not this the ordinary way, whereby God hath appointed the people to
atteine knowledge. S. Paule saithe, <hi>Fides ex auditu:</hi>

men emonge the Iewes. Yet God neuer set vp any suche Bookes for them to reade:
but contrarywise euermore forebade them, and cried against them, and woulde not
suffer them. If this be so speedy, and so ready a way to teache the People, how hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth
it, that where as is greatest stoare of suche Schoolemaisters, there the

               <p>The seconde cause of the vse of Images, is the stirringe of our mindes to al godlynesse. For where
as the affecte and desire of man is heauy, and dul in Diuine and spiritual thinges,<note place="margin">Sapient. 9.</note> because the Bodie
that is corruptible weigheth downe the minde: when it is set foorthe before our eies by Images,
what Christe hath doone for vs, and what the Sainctes haue doone for Christe: then it is quickned,
and moued to the like will of dooinge, and sufferinge, and to al endeuour of holy and vertuouse life.
As when we heare apte and fitte woordes vttered in a Sermon, or an Oration: so when we beholde
lookes, and gestures liuely expressed in Images, we are mooued to pitie, to weepinge, to ioye, and to
other affectes. VVherein verily it hathe alwaies beene thought, that painters haue had no lesse grace,
then either Oratours, or Poetes.</p>
               <p>VVho listeth to see examples hereof, he maye peruse the seconde Nicene Councel,<note place="margin">Action. 4.</note> where he shal
finde amonge other moste notable thinges concerninge this pointe, one of <hi>S.</hi> Euphemia the Martyr, an
other of Abraham sacrificinge his Sonne Isaac, woorthy of euerlastinge memorie, that of Asterius the
holy Bishop, this of Gregorie Nyssene, very elegantly described. Virgil maketh Aeneas to weepe, to hope
for better fortune, to gather courage of minde, to take good aduise, and order for redresse, and helpe
of his greate calamities, by occasion of beholdinge a Painters woorke at Carthago, wherein the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile
of Troye was expressed. VVhiche that wise Poete woulde not haue doone, were it not that Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
haue greate force to moue mennes hartes.</p>
               <p>Ouide likewise in the Epistle of Laodamia to Protesilaus hir husbande beinge foorth at warres,
maketh hir so to write of his Image, whiche she had caused to be made of waxe for hir comforte
in his absence, as it maye wel appeare, that Images haue a meruailouse power to stirre vehement af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectes,
and to represente thinges absent, as though in manner they were presente, in the mindes of
the beholders. Amonge al other examples for this purpose, that seemeth to me most notable, whiche
Appianus writeth of <hi>C.</hi> Iulius Caesar <hi>li. 2. De bellis ciuilibus.</hi> After that Caesar had beene mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
of the Senatours in the Councel house, one of his frendes, to shewe the crueltie of the facte
to the people, laied Caesars bedde in the open markette place, and tooke foorth of it his Image made of
waxe, whiche represented three and twentie woundes after a beastly sorte stabde into his face, and
al the rest of his bodie, yet gapinge, and as it were freshe bleedinge. VVith whiche shewe he stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the people to more wrathe and rage, then he coulde haue doone with any oration or gesture:
whiche was declared foorthwith. For as soone as the people sawe it, not hable to beare their griefe,
nor staye their furie any lenger, they wrought greate and strange cruelties againste them, that were
founde to haue committed that murder.</p>
               <p>The thirde cause, why Images haue beene set vp in Churches, is the keepinge of thinges in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
necessary to our saluation. For when we cast our cies on them, our memorie, whiche otherwise
is fraile and weake, gathereth togeather, and imbraceth the benefites, and merites of our Sauiour
Christe, and the vertuouse examples of Sainctes, whiche we ought to folowe: that if we be suche,
as they were, we maye by Goddes grace through Christe attaine the blisse they be in, and with them
enioye life euerlastinge. And verily they that haue Images in regarde, and reuerence, must be so min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
as they beholde, not onely the thinges by them represented, but also perfourme the same in deede
with most diligent imitation.</p>

loue him in his hart: After a fewe woordes vttered in this sense, he saithe further: VVe knowe
thou demaundest not the Image of our Sauiour to the intent to woorship it, as God: But for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of the Sonne of God, that thou mightest be enkendled with the loue of him, whose Image
thou desirest to beholde. And verily we fal not downe before it, as before God. But we adoure and
woorship him, whom through occasion of the Image, we remember either borne, or doone to deathe

                  </hi> Thus the worlde was borne in hande,
that Images were not onely bare Images, but had also some secrete diuine power
hidden within them, and therefore were woorthy to be honoured.</p>
               <p>Here is imagined a greate difference in Adoration between <hi>Latria,</hi> and <hi>Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia.
<hi>Latria is the honoure, that belongeth onely vnto God</hi>

of the supreme Dominion.</hi> But of <hi>Doulia,</hi> whiche is the other parte, and may
be Englished a Seruice, and, as they say, is dewe vnto a Creature, he thought it
best, to say nothinge. Thus, by M. Hardinges distinction, wee must Honour God, &amp;
Serue Images. And therefore this reuerence, so geuen, may not be called <hi>Idolola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tria,</hi>
but <hi>Idolodulia:</hi> That is to saye, <hi>Not the Honouringe, but onely the seruinge, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beieinge

no Greeke, and cannot so learnedly discerne <hi>Latria,</hi> from <hi>Doulia,</hi> but take
the one Adoration, for the other? Uerily, as it now fareth in the Churche of
Rome, they vse them bothe vniuersally without difference.</p>
               <p>Therefore this distinction, thus applied, seemeth muche like to that, the Phisitians
wife sometime said, Peper is colde in woorkinge, and hoate in operation. For
M. Hardinges distinction standeth not in difference of mater, but onely in woordes.

               <head>The B. of Sarisburie.</head>
               <p>Here M. Hardinge alloweth the people, to reade the Scriptures: how be it, not
what they list, but with restrainte, and at deliuerie: that is to saye, not cases of
question, or perteining to Knowledge, but onely maters belonginge to manners,
and order of life. And so he reserueth Knowledge to him selfe, and his Brethren:
and leaueth Good Life vnto the People. Touching the Bookes of S. Augustine,
S. Basile, and S. Cyprian, it is vntrue, that they were written namely, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely
for the Unlearned: Or if they were, why are they not Translated? Why
are they not deliuered vnto the people, for whose sakes they were written?</p>
               <p>Moreouer, it is vntrue, that in these Bookes is conteined onely mater of life, &amp;
manners, and nothing perteining to Religion. For the first woordes in this booke
of S. Augustine called, <hi>Speculum,</hi> are these: <hi>Non facies tibi Sculptile. <hi>Thou shalt
make to thee selfe no grauen Image:</hi>
                  </hi> whiche is now a Special case of Religion. And the
greatest parte of S. Cyprians Booke, <hi>Ad Quirinum,</hi> conteineth a ful disputation
of Christes Incarnation, Natiuitie, and Passion, and other like cases of Religion
against the Iewes. Touching S. Basile, as he wrote this Booke of Moralles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Manners: so he had written an other Booke before, concerning Faith: and
bothe these Bookes for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people. He maketh his entrie into his Moralles with these
woordes, <hi>Cùm de Sana Fide in Praecede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ribꝰ sufficienter ad praesens dictu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> esse putemꝰ, &amp;c:

Therefore this Assertion was vntrue, and so no firme grounde, for M. Harding to
stande vpon. Neither did any of the Olde Fathers euer withdraw y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people from
the Uniuersal, and free reading of Gods Woorde, and restraine them onely to such
shorte Collections. S. Basile saithe, <hi>The Scriptures are like vnto a Shoppe ful of

               <p>But to leaue coniectures, Beda<note place="margin">Beda in Histor.</note> saithe expressely, and in moste plaine woordes,
that one Cedman an Englishe Poete,<note place="margin">Anglorum. li. 5. ca. 22.</note> Translated the Creation of the worlde, and
the whole storie of the Genesis, &amp; the Exodus, and sundrie other stories of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Bible

Sir Iohn Treuisa<note place="margin">Iohan Treuisa. li. 5. ca. 24.</note> saith, that Beda him self turned S. Iohns Gospel into English.

And vntil this day there be diuers suche Translations yet remaininge to be seene,
whiche, for many causes, beare good proufe of greate Antiquitie. Therefore, that
this Iland hath continued thirtéene hundred yéeres without hauinge y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Scriptures
in Englishe, it can beare no manner appearance, or shew of Trueth.</p>
               <p>But beinge admitted, and graunted for true, If prescription of wante maye
make good proufe, then maye wee saye, This Ilande stoode, and continued foure
thousande whole yéeres, not onely without the Englishe Bible, but also without
any knowledge of Christe, or God. Likewise wée may truely say, The Gospel, and
the Truethe of God stoode, and continued in this Iland for the space of many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
yeeres, without either the Supremacie of Rome, or Transubstantiation, or
Priuate Masses, or any other like fantasies.</p>
               <p>True it is, our Fathers of late yeeres haue beene leadde in ignorance, &amp; haue
beene violently forced from the Scriptures. But the examples, and wantes of our
Fathers, are not alwaies sufficient Rules of Faith. The Heretique Eutyches
saide, <hi>Sic a progenitoribus meis accipiens credidi: In hac Fide genitus sum, &amp; consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus

               <p>Upon these woordes of Beda M. Hardinge Concludeth thus: <hi>The Latine tongue
for the studie of the Scriptures, was common to al the Nations of this Realme: <hi>Ergo,</hi> The
Scriptures were not translated into Englishe.</hi> A very Childe may soone see the simplicitie
and the weakenesse of this reason. For euen now, notwithstandinge the whole
Bible be Translated into the Englishe tongue, extante in euery Churche, and
common to al the people, yet the Latine tongue is neuerthelesse Common to al the
Nations of this Lande, for the readinge of Olde Commentaries, and the A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>cient
Doctours, and so for the meditation, and studie of the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Now let vs weigh M. Hardinges Considerations in this behalfe. First if
there had any faultes escaped in the Englishe Translation, as he vntruely saithe,
there haue many, he woulde not thus haue past them vncontrolled. He lackte nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
eloquence, nor good wil, to speake: but onely good mater to speake of.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the Scriptures Translated into English, haue béene deliuered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the people by suche Bishoppes, and other Spiritual guides, as in déede haue had
a care for their soules, and haue geuen their liues, and Bloud, for their sheepe.
But the Bishops of M. Hardinges side, can onely espie faultes in Translations:
but they can amende none. They haue burnte a greate number of Bibles: but they
haue hitherto Translated none. Christes Woordes are rightly verified of them,
<hi>Neither doo yee enter your selues, nor wil you suffer others, that woulde entre.</hi> For the
highest Principle of their Religion is this: <hi>Ignorance is the Mother of True Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> To limite, and to diet the people, what they may reade, and what they ought
to leaue, was sometime the Superstitious discretion of the Rabbines. Herein wee
may saye, as S. Hilarie saithe,<note place="margin">Origen. in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logo in Cantica Canti.</note> 
                  <hi>Archangeli nesciunt: Angeli non audiuerunt: Propheta

                  </hi> Certainely, now, the Uele being drawen aside, and our faces being open,
to beholde the Glorie of God,<note place="margin">Hilari. de Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate patris &amp; Filij.</note> S. Paule saithe, <hi>Omnis Scriptura diuinitùs inspirata

                     <hi>Al thinges, that are written, are written for our instruction.</hi>
                  </hi> And therefore Irenaeus

                  </hi> The readinge of the Scriptures is a greate fense against sinne.

               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore the Apostles of Christe, and al other godly Fathers haue euermore

               <p>It is clearely witnessed by al these doctours, against M. Hardinge, and the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the Churche of Rome, that the woordes of Consecration were pronounced
with a Lowde Uoice: and that the People, not onely hearde, but also vnderstoode,

thée, good Reader, to remember, that Leo, as wel herein, as also in sundrie other
places, bendeth the whole force of his learninge against the Heretique Eutyches,
whoes erroure was this, muche like vnto the common erroure, that is nowe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,
that Christes Bodie, after his Ascension, was turned wholy into the God-head,
and so was no lenger a Mannes Bodie. Against whiche erroure Leo taketh
an argumente of the holy Mysteries: wherein the Faithful People, as with theire
Bodily Mouth they receiue the Mystical Breade, and Wine, so with their Sprite,
and Faith they receiue the Bodie, and Bloude of Christe, and that verily, and in
Trueth: and in witnesse thereof y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> receiuer saith, <hi>Amen.</hi> But, saith Leo, he saith,
<hi>Amen,</hi> in vaine, that denieth the same thinge, that he receiueth: That is to saie,
That receiueth the Sacramente of Christes Bodie, and yet neuerthelesse is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded,
as the Heretique Eutyches was, that Christe in deede hath no Bodie. And
in this sense S. Augustine seemeth to saie,<note place="margin">Beda. 1. Corin. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Mors illi erit, non Vita, qui mendacem pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tauerit
Vitam. <hi>The receiuinge of the Sacramente shal be Death, and not life vnto him, that
thinketh, that Christ, beinge the life it selfe, was a lyer,</hi>
                  </hi> Deliueringe these holy Mysteries,
as the Sacramente, or Pleage of his Bodie, him selfe in deede hauinge no Bodie.
So likewise Prosper Aquitanus,<note place="margin">Prosper De pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss. Dei, parte 1. cap. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Christum à Populo Iudaico fuisse occisum, nullus ia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

and crieth,</hi> Amen. <hi>Therefore, yf the Iewe wil denie, that euer he slewe Christe, God maie

                  </hi> Thus, by the iudgemente of these learned Fathers, Eutyches
the Heretique, or any other, that denied, either the Bodie, or the Death of Christe,
might soone be reproued, euen by the receiuinge of these holy Mysteries. For they

&amp; so, as Leo saith, they dispute against the thinge it selfe, that they receiue.

Frantike, and vngodly people, mought not be present at the Holy Mysteries:</hi> Ergo, <hi>Nowe the godly

but M. Hardinge. And yet this, he thinketh, for Wise, Zelous, &amp; Godly menne is
sufficient. As for the rest, in déede M. Hardinge, as a man of trauaile, that hath
béene in Rome, and hath séene Bishoppes, &amp; Cardinalles men of warre: Children,
&amp; Boies sette in the highest Degrées, &amp; Dignities of the Churche: Open Stewes so
déerely rented: so many thousande Cortegianes so wel regarded: Priestes so fréely
allowed to kéepe their Concubines: The Churche of God turned into a Caue of
Théeues: Suche corruption in the Cleregie: suche corruption in the People: So li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

this suffered without Correction, &amp; wel allowed of, &amp; accoumpted Catholique: sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge,
I saie, the Churche of God in Rome thus vsed, he may iustely complaine of
corruption of life, and loosenesse of Discipline. How be it, it were harde hereof to
conclude, that therefore noman may heare the Woordes of Consecration. Uerily
it is thought lawful for Usurers, Théeues, Hoores, Murderers, Traitours, and al

vp vnto his Father. In a Figure, as in the Olde Lawe: In Deede, and Blouddily, as vpon the Crosse:
In a Sacrament, or Mysterie, as in the Newe Testament.</hi> Of whiche thrée waies, the Bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Oblation of Christe vpon the Crosse, is the very, true, and onely Propitiatorie
Sacrifice for the Sinnes of the worlde. The other two, as in respecte, and manner
of Signifieing, they are sundrie, so in effecte, and substance, they are al one. For,
like as in the Sacramentes of the Olde Lawe was expressed the Death of Christe,
that was to comme: Euen so in the Sacramentes of the Newe Lawe of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
is expressed the same Death of Christe already paste. As wee haue Mysteries,
so had they Mysteries: As wee Sacrifice Christ, so did they Sacrifice Christe: As the
Lambe of God is slaine vnto vs, So was the same Lambe of God slaine vnto them.

               <p>This is the Difference that S. Augustine noteth bitwéene the Sacramentes

               <p>But, where as he addeth further, <hi>That Christe is in deede, and verily offered by the Priest,
al be it,</hi> as he saith, <hi>not in respecte of the manner of offeringe, but onely in respecte of the presence of

For what a fantasie is this, to saie, Christe is offered Uerily, and in deede, and yet
not in Respecte of the Manner of offeringe? What Respecte? What Manner is
this? Wherefore comme these blinde Mysteries abroade without a glose? Whiche

of S. Augustine:<note place="margin">Contra Faustum lib. 20. cap. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>In this Sacrifice the Death of Christe is solemnized by a Sacramente of

               <p>Touchinge the Oblation of Christes Bodie, wée beléeue, &amp; Confesse as muche,
as the Holy Ghost hath opened in the Scriptures. Where as M. Hardinge saithe,
<hi>Christes Bodie is offered vp by the Priest vnto God the Father, in Remembrance of that Bodie, that
Christe himselfe offered vpon the Crosse,</hi> He séemeth not to consider the inconstancie, and
folie of his owne tale. For it is wel knowen to al Creatures, not onely Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,
but also Iewes, Turkes, and Saracenes, that Christe was Crucified vpon the
Crosse: But that Christe should be Sacrificed by a Mortal man, Inuisibly, and, as
they saie, vnder the Formes of Breade, and Wine, and that Really, and in deede,
it is a thinge so far passinge the common sense of Christian knowledge, that the
best learned, and wisest of the Ancient learned Christian Fathers coulde neuer
know it.</p>

Confirmation of a manifest Trueth, by an open Errour.</p>
               <p>Neither doo wée robbe the Churche of God of that most Heauenly, and moste
comfortable Sacrifice of Christes Bodie: But rather wee open, and disclose the
errours, wherewith certaine of late yeeres haue wilfully deceiued the Churche
of God. Wée know, <hi>That Christes Badie was rente for our Sinnes,</hi>

his discretion, and skil in the choise. His choise wil séeme vnskilful, if he allege his
Authorities biside his purpose. His purpose, and promise is to prooue, that the
Priest hath good warrant, to offer vp Christe the Sonne of God vnto his Father.
Whiche purpose if he neuer vouchesaue once to touche, but range abroade, as his
manner is, and roaue idlely at maters impertinent, then muste wee needes saie,
He bewraieth his wante, and bringeth his greate Stoare out of credit. So shal the
offer, that is gently made him, séeme to stande vpon good, and conuenient termes,

                  <hi>Christe hath an euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastinge

vpon the Crosse, is so acceptable in the good wil of God, and so standeth in continual strength
and Vertue, that the same Oblation is no lesse acceptable this daie in the sight of God the

Foolishe, I know not why. Neither is it thought a wisemannes parte, either

not, what he speaketh, as, in this case, it is thought, M. Harding dooth,
hath no greate cause, in this behalfe, to charge others with folie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="567" facs="tcp:12563:298"/>Of the other side, what so euer Mortal man presumeth to offer vp Christe in
Sacrifice, and dareth to desire God the Father so fauourably to beholde his owne
onely Sonne, as in olde times he behelde the Oblation of Abel, or of Melchisedek,
and is not afraide, therewith to beguile the simple, and to mocke the worlde, as
M. Hardinge doothe daily at his Masse, he can not wel excuse him selfe of open
wickednesse.</p>
               <p>Notwithstandinge this matter is easily answeared. <hi>For</hi> (saith he) <hi>wee Sacrifice
not Christe againe: The Oblation, that Christe made vpon the Crosse, and ours in the Masse, is al one.
And this Sacrifice Christe hath commaunded vs to continew vntil his comminge.</hi> If M. Harding
make the selfe same Sacrifice, that Christe made vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Crosse, then is he <hi>A Prieste
after the order of Melchisedek:</hi> And so, <hi>The Kinge of Iustice: The Prince of Peace: and
a Prieste for euer, without Successour.</hi> For these titles be incident to the Priesthoode of
Melchisedek: whiche neuerthelesse, I thinke, M. Hardinge of his modestie wil
not acknowledge. And without the same, he cannot offer vp to God the same
Sacrifice, that Christe offered vpon the Crosse.</p>
               <p>And where he saithe, <hi>Christe hath commaunded him, and his Felowes to make, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
this Sacrifice vntil his comminge,</hi> If he had meante simply, and plainely, he would
haue shewed, either when, or where, or by what woordes Christe gaue him this
Commaundement. For so large a Commission is woorthy the shewinge: And it
were greate boldenesse, to attempte suche a mater without Commission.</p>

the Prophecie of Malachie be vnderstanded of the Oblation of Christe vpon the Crosse, for as muche

of speàche, was not Christe the Sonne of God, but onely material Breade, and
Wine, and other like prouision of Uictualles prepared for Abraham, and for his

same in Sacrifice vnto God:</hi> but, <hi>He brought it foorth, as a present,</hi> as the manner was, to
refreashe them, after the pursuite, and chase of their enimies. And S. Hierome

               <p>Sometimes they compare it with the Sacrifice of Thankesgeuinge, and with
the Ministration of the holy Communion, and make it equal with the same.</p>

                  </hi> These Authorities might serue, to make some shew, that
Melchisedek saide Masse, and Consecrated the Sacrament of the Bodie, and Bloud
of Christe, and offered vp Christe in Sacrifice vnto his Father: But of M. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge,

               <p>And least any man happen of simplicitie to be deceiued, thinkinge that S.

               <p>This obiection is easily answeared. S. Ambrose saithe, that in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Congregation,
and in the time of the holy Mysteries, he woulde offer vp vnto God praises, and
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:12563:309"/>
Thankesgeuinge for that Godly Emperour Ualentinian. But he saithe not, That
he woulde offer Christe the Sonne of God vnto God his Father, or receiue the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramente
for the Emperour. Therefore M. Hardinge might wel haue past this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
ouer emonge the reste.</p>
               <p>Neither did S. Ambrose thinke, that the Emperour Ualentinian was in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie,
whereas, M. Hardinge imagineth, he might be relieued: but contrarywise
he presumeth, him vndoubtedly to be in Heauen. For thus he writeth of him:
<hi>Quae nam est haec anima, &amp;c. <hi>What is this Soule,<note place="margin">Ambros. De O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitu Valenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niani Imperat.</note> that looketh foorth as the Daie
Starre, bewtiful as the Moone, Chosen as the Sunne? O blissed Soule, thou lookest downe
from abooue vpon vs, being here beneath: Thou hast escaped the darknes of this World: Thou
art bright as the Moone: Thou shineste as the Sunne.</hi>

Aeternae Vitae fruitur Voluptate. Beati ambo. <hi>Beinge now with his Brother, he
enioieth the pleasure of euerlastinge life. Blissed are they bothe.</hi>
                  </hi> Therefore the Sacrifice,
that S. Ambrose made, was not a Propitiatorie, or Satisfactorie, or other like
Masse, whereby M. Hardinge thinketh him selfe hable, to baile soules out of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie,
but onely a Sacrifice of Thankesgeuinge for that Godly Emperoure, beinge
nowe in Heauen.</p>

without warrant of Goddes woorde, yet, I confesse, it was many wheres receiued,

by some that is acceptable. Now the partie that offereth, is of two sortes. The one offereth immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly,

firste is the Prieste that consecrateth, offereth, and receiueth the Sacrament, who so dothe these thinges
in his owne person, yet by Goddes auctoritie, as none other in so offeringe is concurrent with him.
The partie, that offereth mediatly or by meane of an other, and principally, is the Churche militant,
in whose person the Prieste offereth, and whose minister he is in offering. For this is the Sacrifice of the
whole Churche. The firste partie that offereth, is not alwaies acceptable to God, neither alwaies
pleaseth him, because oftentimes he is a Sinner. The seconde partie that offereth, is euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
acceptable to God, because the Churche is alwaies Holy, belooued, and the onely spouse
of Christe. And in this respecte the Masse is an acceptable seruice to God, <hi>Ex opere operantis,</hi>
                  <pb n="598" facs="tcp:12563:314"/>
and is not without cause and reason called a Sacrifice Propitiatorie, not for that it deserueth
mercie at Goddes hande of it selfe, as Christe doothe, who onely is in that principal and special
sorte a Sacrifice Propitiatorie: but for that it mooueth God to geue mercie, and remission of Sinne
already deserued by Christe. In this degree of a Sacrifice propitiatorie, wee maye put Praier,

woulde haue soone shaken downe al this whole frame of <hi>Opus Operatum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For he neither speaketh of the Masse, nother promiseth Remission of Sinnes for
any thinge, that is donne in the Masse: but onely, and wholy for the Sacrifice of
Christes Bodie vpon the Crosse. His woordes be these, <hi>Si redeas ad illum Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,
qui de Coelo descendit, &amp; dat huic mundo vitam, illum Panem propositionis, hoc
est, Christum ipsum, quem proposuit Deus propitiationem per Fidem in Sanguine eius:
&amp; si respicias ad illam Commemorationem, de qua dicit Dominus, Hoc facite ad meam
Commemorationem, inuenies, quòd ista est Commemoratio sola, quae propitium faciat
hominibus Deum: <hi>Yf thou turne to that Breade, that came downe from Heauen, and
geueth life to this worlde, I meane that Shewebreade, that is, Christe him selfe, whome God
hath appointed to be a Propitiation by Faithe in his Bloude: and if thou beholde that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance,
whereof the Lorde saithe, Doo this in Remembrance of mee, thou shalt finde,
that it is this Remembrance onely</hi>
                  </hi> (that is to saie, The Bodie of Christe Crucified,
and the price of his Bloude thus Remembred) <hi>that maketh God merciful vnto menne.</hi>
Nowe let M. Hardinge indifferently iudge, whether these woordes be likely to
prooue his <hi>Opus Operatum,</hi> or any other thinge belonginge vnto his Masse.</p>
               <p>The place of S. Augustine is yet muche plainer. For, as he toucheth none
of al these M. Hardinges fantasies, so he speaketh onely of the Innocentes, and
Blissed Martyrs, that were slaine onely for the Testimonie of Christe, <hi>VVhose
Soules,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Augustin. De Sanctis Sermon. 11.</note> S. Iohn saith, <hi>lie vnderneathe the Aultar of God,</hi> not in Earthe, as M. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge

                  </hi> (in Heauen) <hi>the Soules of them, that were slaine for Goddes VVoorde, and
for the Testimonie of Iesus.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Apocalyp. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>VVhat thinge is there, either more reuerende, or more Honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
then to reaste vnder that Aultar</hi> (in Heauen) <hi>in whiche Sacrifices are made, and Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are offered vnto God, and wherein</hi> (no mortal man, but) <hi>the Lorde him selfe is the

It is righte,</hi> (not that the Bodies, but) <hi>that the Soules of the Iuste shoulde remaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

wel it is, that Iuste menne doo there require reuengeance of their Bloude, where as Christes
Bloude for sinners is poured out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Immediatly after this, he intermedleth somewhat touchinge Aultars, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
Tables in the Earthe. For thus he addeth further, <hi>Conuenienter igi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,
&amp; quasi pro quodam Consortio ibi Martyribus Sepultura decreta est, vbi Mors Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini

                  </hi> Therefore vpon good discretion, and in some token of Felow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
Martyrs burials are appointed in that place (<hi>here in Earth</hi>) where the Lordes Death
is daily remembred: As the Lorde him selfe saithe, <hi>As often, as ye shal doo these
thinges, ye shal set foorthe my Deathe, vntil I come.</hi> I meane, that
they, that died for the Lordes Deathe, may reaste vnder the Mysterie of his Sacramente.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>After this he returneth againe to the Soules of the Blissed Martyrs, vnder
the Aultar in Heauen. <hi>Legimus plaerósque Iustorum Abrahae sinibus refoueri &amp;c.
VVee reade,</hi> saithe S. Augustine,</hi> that many Iuste menne are refreashed in Abrahams bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some:
and that many are in the pleasures of Paradise. Yet noman deserued better then the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,
to reaste there (<hi>in Heauen</hi>) where as Christe is bothe the Sacrifice, and the Priest. I meane,
that they may enioye Goddes fauoure by the offeringe of that Sacrifice, and may receiue the
Blissinge, and Ministerie of that Prieste.</p>
               <p>Hereby it is plaine, that S. Augustine speaketh of Heauen: and not of Earth,
nor of Purgatorie: Of the Soules receiued abooue: and not of the Bodies buried
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:12563:315"/>
beneathe. For al these thinges S. Iohn by Reuelation sawe in Heauen. And
for proufe hereof, S. Augustine addeth further: <hi>Inter coeteros igitur Martyres, quos

               </p>
               <p>This is S. Augustines plaine, and vndoubted meaninge. But M. Hardinge
to serue his turne, is faine, of Soules, to make Bodies: of Ioie, to make Paine:

yf thy manner of speakinge were not knowen, the Simple might easily be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.
I graunte, here is a greate Amplification, and Maiestie of woordes, sutche as
the holy Fathers haue muche delited to vse in their Sermons to the People, but
Specially intreatinge of the Sacramentes. S. Ambrose saithe,<note place="margin">Ambros. De Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramen. li. 1. c. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Sacerdos precem

                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tertullian saithe,</hi> The holy Ghoste commeth downe from Heauen,<note place="margin">Tertull. De Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tismo.</note> and reasteth vpon
the Water of Baptisme, and sanctifieth it of him selfe.</p>
               <p>Euen thus S. Cyprian saithe, <hi>The Diuine Substance infuseth it selfe vnspeakeably
into the Visible Sacramente:</hi> None otherwise, then as the Holy Ghoste, or the whole
Blissed Trinitie infuseth it selfe into the Water of Baptisme.</p>
               <p>Paulinus seemeth to write muche agréeably to these woordes of S. Cyprian:
<q>
                     <p>Sanctus in hunc Coelo descendit Spiritus amnem:

<lb/>Concipit Vnda Deum.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The Holy Ghoste into this Water commeth downe from Heauen: And ioineth the
Heauenly Waters, and these Waters bothe in one. Then the Fonte receiueth God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What can be spoken with greater Maiestie?</hi> Then, <hi>saithe he,</hi> the VVater, or the Fonte
receiueth God.</p>
               <p>Yf M. Hardinge out of these woordes of S. Cyprian, be hable by this simple
gheasse to prooue, that the Sacramental Breade was called Lorde, and God, then
by the like gheasse, and the like woordes of Tertullian, S. Ambrose, &amp; Paulinus,
he maie also prooue, that the Water of Baptisme was likewise called Lorde, and
God. For the fourme, and manner of speache is al one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But these, and other like Phrases be vsual,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Augustin. De Baptismo contra Donatistas, lib. 3. cap. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>and ordinarie emonge the Ancient
learned Fathers. S. Augustine writeth thus: <hi>Baptismi Sanctitas pollui non
potest: &amp; Sacramento suo Diuina Virtus assistit:</hi>
                  </hi> The Holines of Baptisme cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed.

               <p>
                  <hi>Likewise S. Cyprian, touchinge the halowinge of the Oile, writeth thus: <hi>In Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentis
Virtus Diuina potentiùs operatur. Adest Veritas Signo, &amp; Spiritus Sacramento:</hi>
                  </hi>

these plaine woordes of S. Augustine it appeareth, that Comming to Baptisme, is
Comming to Christe. Yet may not M. Hardinge conclude thereof, that the Water

               <p>Our Comminge vnto Christe,<note place="margin">August. Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Iudaeos ca. 1.</note> is Beléeuinge in Christe. S. Augustine saith,

waies, and meanes wée maie comme vnto him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His woordes be these, <hi>Aquilae in hac vita facti ad ipsum Coelum euolemus, &amp; caet.</hi>
                  </hi>
Beinge made Eagles in this life, let vs flee vp into Heauen, or rather abooue the Heauens.
For where as the Carkesse is, there are the Eagles. The Carkesse is our Lordes Bodie in respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cte
of his Death. But he calleth vs Eagles, to shewe vs, that, who so wil comme neare to that
Bodie, must mounte on highe, and haue no dealinge with the Earth, nor to bowe downewarde,
or to creepe beneathe, but euer to soare alofte, and to beholde the Sonne of Iustice, and to haue
a quicke eie in our harte.</p>
               <p>Thus S. Chrysostome teacheth vs, bothe where Christe reasteth in the Glorie
of his Father: and by what meanes wée maie comme vnto him: and with what eies
wée maie beholde him. Then hauinge thus auaunced our mindes into Heauen, he
saithe, <hi>Propter hoc Corpus, &amp;c. <hi>For this Bodies sake,</hi>

Sacramente, or in a Mysterie.</p>
               <p>But M. Hardinge wil saie, <hi>The Sacramente, of S. Ambrose is called Lorde.</hi> This is an
other vntrueth, and like the reste of M. Hardinges proufes. Christe sittinge
nowe at the Right hande of God is the Breade, and foode of life: Thither S. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose

               <p>For so to saie, as it shal hereafter appeare, it were greate blasphemie.</p>
               <p>And that S. Ambrose meante this, not of the Sacramente, but of the Bodie of

                  </hi> Which later clause M. Hardinge, as his manner
is, hath purposely dissembled. As the Priest heareth Christe speake vnto him,
so he holdeth Christ in his hande. But the Priest heareth not Christ speake Uerily,
and in deede, but by a Figure: Therefore it seemeth, it may reasonably be geathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

is he there intiere, and whole, God, and Man.</hi> In deede, the first being graunted, the rest
must needes folow. But how is M. Harding so wel assured of the first? What olde

present vnder these Formes, or Fantasies of Breade, and Wine?</hi> If the learned Fathers
saie so, it were good, to shew it: If they saie not so, it is greate shame, to pleade it.

               <p>It were very muche for M. Hardinge to say, that he praieth God, that the holy
Ghoste may come vpon Christe: or, that God at his request, and for his sake, wil

our Lorde, and God, as he sometime receiued a Goate, or a Weather, or any other

afraide, he dooth, then is this vndoubtedly the very tenoure, and meaninge of his
praier. But if he dissemble, and speake otherwise, then he thinketh, and that at
the secreteste, and holyest parte of al his Masse, then by his owne Confession, and
by the Authoritie of his owne Masse booke, the Sacrament is not Lorde, and God.</p>

               <p>For excuse hereof, M. Hardinge saithe, This Doctrine serued onely for the
Schooles, and had no place emonge the People. But so likewise did the reste of al
their Doctrine. For it was euer their greatest policie, to keepe their learninge in
the Schooles, and to see, that the People should knowe nothing. S. Hierome saith,

               <p>And verily, yf the Sacramente be God in deede, and that, not a God for euer,

why shoulde not al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> People vnderstande, when it beginneth to be God: how longe
it contineweth God: when it is God: when it is no God: &amp;, how longe they maie A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doure

duringe the time it is God, who so Adoureth it not is wicked, &amp; godlesse: and, who
so Adoureth it, when it is no God, committeth Idolatrie, and Adoureth a Creature

Iuel requireth, or no, it shal not greatly force. The credite of the Catholique Faithe dependeth not

The doctrine of the Churche is this: The Bodie of Christe after due Consecration remaineth so longe
in the Sacrament, as the Sacramente endureth.<note place="margin">The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

other qualities of Breade, and VVine be corrupted, and quite altered, then is the forme also of
the same annichilated, and vndone. And to speake of this more particularly, sith that the

suffised to the corruption of Breade and VVine, in case of their remaindre, for suche a change the
Body and Bloude of Christe ceaseth not to be in this Sacrament, whether the change be in qualitie, as if
the colour, sauour, and smel of Breade and VVine be a litle altered, or in quantitie, as if thereof diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

there be made so great a change, as the nature of Breade and VVine should be corrupted, if they were
present: then the Body and Bloude of Christe doo not remaine in this Sacrament, as when the colour
and sauour, and other qualities of Breade and VVine are so farre changed, as the nature of Breade
and VVine mighte not beare it: or on the quantities side, as if the Bread be so smal crom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

no more the Body and Bloude in this Sacrament. Thus the Body and Bloude of Christe remaineth in

to be any more,<note place="margin">August. ad Bonifaciu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> epist. 23.</note> then also ceaseth the Body and Bloud of Christe to be in the Sacrament. For there muste

Substance. To be shorte, thus of Night they make Daie, and of Daie they make

a longe Fable of his owne: whiche notwithstandinge, as he saithe, is the
Doctrine of the Churche. But miserable is that Churche, that hathe neither Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
nor Councel, nor Doctour, to approue her Doctrine.</p>
               <p>Firste he imagineth, <hi>That Christes Bodie is Really in the Sacramente, so longe, as the

Christes Bodie once departe awaie, then is the Sacramente nomore a Sacramente.</hi> Thus this
Doctrine turneth rounde. If it be a Sacramente, then is Christes Bodie there: yf
Christes Bodie be there, then is it a Sacramente. So simply, and plainely they
teache the people. O happy are they, that haue sutche Maisters.</p>
               <p>Further he saithe, <hi>The Substance of the Breade, and VVine is Really changed into the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
and Bloude of Christe.</hi> And this he auoucheth by Scriptures without woordes, and
by Doctours without names.</p>
               <p>Afterwarde, he keepeth greate Mutes aboute Qualities, and Quantities:
<hi>Howe far the coloure, or sauoure, or other qualities of the Breade maie be altered: and into howe
smal mites the Breade maie be crommed</hi> (for these be his owne woordes) <hi>and yet neuerthelesse
Christes Bodie continewe in it.</hi> No doubte, a very plaine, and comfortable, and a saue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

and other learned Fathers traueiled far, and deepely withe great studie:
S. Paule was lifted vp into the thirde Heauen: yet none of them coulde vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande
it.</p>
               <p>In the ende he saithe, <hi>There must be a conuenience, and a Resemblance bytweene the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente,
and the thinges, whereof it is a Sacramente.</hi> For example, As Water dooth washe,
and refreashe our Bodies: so by Resemblance wée are taught in the Water of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme,
that Christes Bloude dooth washe, and refreashe our Soules. And, as our
bodies be Feadde by material Breade: so in the holy Communion wée are taught by
like Resemblance, that our soules are Feadde with the Bodie of Christe. Sutche
conuenient Likenesse there is, bitweene the Sacramente, and the thinge that is
Represented by the Sacramente. But what sutche Resemblance, or Likenesse can
M. Hardinge imagin herein, to further his fantasie? Wherein are his Accidentes
like vnto Christes Bodie? Or wherein is Christes Bodie like vnto his Accidentes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Wil he saie, that the Accidentes of Breade doo nourishe, and increase the Substance
of our bodies? Or y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our soules liue so by Christes Bodie, as our bodies liue by Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentes?
If he leaue this Resemblance of Feedinge, and Nourishinge, what other
Resemblance can he finde?</p>
               <p>O, howe muche better were if, for M. Hardinge simply, and plainely to confesse,
that, as wel for this Article, as for the rest, he is vtterly destitute, not onely of the

               <p>But touchinge the force of this Article, Cyrillus speaketh not one Woorde,

               <p>Concerninge the Reseruation of the Sacramente, that Cyrillus speaketh of,

<pb n="623" facs="tcp:12563:327"/>
as it is vntruely reported by M. Hardinge, but that Christes Institution, &amp;
the Mystical Benediction, whiche he calleth the Quickeninge Grace, continueth
stil. And his reason is this: for that al Sacramentes haue their vertue, &amp; Power,
not of them selfe, but wholy, and onely from Christe. Wherefore, as Christe is
one, &amp; continueth stil without change: euen so muste the Grace, that Christe woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
in vs by his Sacramentes, be likewise one, and continewe stil. And as there
is no vertue in the Water of Baptisme, but when it is vsed: euen so there is no
vertue in the Breade of the Holy Communion, but likewise onely when it is vsed.</p>
               <p>As for the Quickeninge Grace, it is as wel in the one Sacramente, as in the
other. S. Ambrose saithe, <hi>Aqua Baptismatis habet Gratiam Dei, &amp; Praesentiam Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitatis:</hi>

               <head>The B. of Sarisburie.</head>
               <p>Here it appeareth, that M. Hardinge somewhat misliketh his Catholique
Maisters, and thinketh it now an errour, to say, That a Mouse may eate the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
of Christe: and therefore he calleth this parte of his owne Doctrine, <hi>A vile as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seueration.</hi>
But if this Asseueration of M. Hardinges owne Doctours, &amp; greatest
Doctours be so Uile, then Uile were they, that firste diuised it. And yet I cannot
wel sée, how he may so lightly recante the Doctrine, that he was borne, &amp; brought
vp in, and condemne his owne felowes of villanie, without blame.</p>
               <p>How be it, One good excuse he séemeth to haue, that this parte of his Religion
was neuer Uniuersally receiued, nor counted Catholique. And therefore he saithe,
<hi>It is no keie of his Religion.</hi> If M. Hardinge wil measure al the reste in this sorte,
I feare mee, very fewe partes of his whole Religion wil prooue Catholique. And
yet the firste diuisours, and setters foorthe, and mainteiners hereof, tooke this euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
for a principal keie, as without whiche the rest of their Doctrine coulde not
stande. Yet were they euermore accoumpted, bothe as Uniuersal for their Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge,
and as Catholique for their Religion, and as constante in the same, as
M. Hardinge.</p>
               <p>But in déede, the Olde holy Fathers, S. Ambrose, S. Augustine, S. Hierome,
S. Chrysostome neuer hearde of this strange Doctrine: nor, if they had hearde it,
would euer haue taken it for locke, or keie of their Religion: but would rather haue
thought him woorthy to be lockte vp, as a madde man, that woulde either haue
taught it, as greate numbers haue doone: or els haue doubted of it, as M. Hardinge
doothe. Now let vs see, by whome this Doctrine hath béene mainteined. So, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it haue béene holden for Catholique, or no, it wil soone appeare.</p>
               <p>Yet notwithstandinge, I muste protest before hande, that the speaches, that
they haue vsed in this behalfe, are so Blasphemous, and so Uile, that for the Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
I beare to the glorious Bodie of Christe, I can neither heare them, nor vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

               <p>Notwithstandinge his Resolution is this: <hi>Sanè dici potest, quòd Corpus Christi

the Bodie of Christe.</hi>
                  </hi> But this Sentence is reuersed, and not thought Catholique.
For the greate Facultie of Parise hath geuen this iudgemente vpon the same,
<hi>Hic Magister non tenetur: <hi>Herein the Maister is not allowed.</hi>
                  </hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Touchinge suche cases, as herein maie happen, Antoninus the Archebishop of
Florence writeth thus:</hi>

throwgh whoes negligence it happened, be enioined to penance fourtie daies. And yf it be pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
let the Mouse be taken, and burnte, and let his ashes be buried in, or aboute the Aultare.
<hi>But Peter of Palus saith,</hi> The Mouses entralles must be drawen: and the Portion of the
Sacramente, that there remaineth, yf the Priest be squaimishe to receiue it, must reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly be saide

doubteful Doctrine, it behooueth vs to vnderstande, that, as S. Augustine saithe,
there is greate difference bitwéene Christes Bodie, and the Sacramente. For the
Sacramente is Corruptible: Christes Bodie is Elorious, &amp; voide of al corruption.
The Sacramente is in the Earth: Christes Bodie is in Heauen. The Sacrament
is receiued by our Bodily Mouth: Christes Bodie is receiued onely by Faithe,
whiche is the mouth of our Soule. And who so vnderstandeth not this difference,
vnderstandeth not the meaninge of any Sacramente.</p>
               <p>Now, to applie the same to this purpose, The Mouse, or other Woorme may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
the substance of the Breade, whiche is the outwarde corruptible Elemente of
the Sacramente: But the very Bodie of Christe it selfe, whiche is in Heauen, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be receiued, but by Faithe onely, and none otherwise.</p>

               <p>What meaneth M. Hardinge, thus to encombre him selfe with these vaine,

Likenesse,</hi> he saithe, <hi>a Sacramente is no Sacramente.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Therefore M. Hardinge commeth in with his Fantasie, and telleth vs, that
his Fourmes, and Accidentes are the Resemblance, and Likenesse of the Bodie of
Christe. But, alas, wherein standeth this Comparison of Resemblance, and Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse?
Or wherein are M. Hardinges Accidentes, and Christes Bodie like togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
Certainely M. Hardinge him selfe, notwithstandinge he can say many
thinges, yet he cannot truely say, that Christes Bodie is either rounde, or plaine, or
white, or thinne, or any way like vnto his Accidentes.</p>
               <p>Yet must there be a certaine likenesse in effectes bitwéene the Sacrament, and
the thinge it selfe, whereof it is a Sacramente. Of whiche effectes, the one is
Sensible, and wrought outwardly to the Bodie: the other is Spiritual, &amp; wrought
inwardly in the minde. As for example, in the Sacramente of Circumcision, the
Outwarde Uisible Cuttinge in the Fleashe, was a Resemblance of the Inwarde
Spiritual Cuttinge of the Harte. In the Sacramente of Baptisme, the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
Washinge of the Bodie, is a Resemblance of the Inwarde Spiritual
Washinge of the Soule.</p>
               <p>Likewise in the Sacramente of the Holy Communion, as the Breade Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
Feedeth our Bodies: so doothe Christes Bodie Inwardly, and Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
Féede our Soules. Thus is Féedinge an effecte common vnto them bothe.

               </p>
               <p>Now, if M. Hardinge, touchinge this effecte of Feedinge, wil compare his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentes
with Christes Bodie, then must he say, That wée Eate Accidentes, and
Drinke Accidentes, and be Feadde with Accidentes, and Liue by Accidentes: euen
as in the Inner man wee Eate Christe, and Drinke Christe, and be Feadde with
Christe, and Liue by Christe. Otherwise he muste confesse, that, touchinge the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte
of Feedinge, his Accidentes haue no Resemblance of Christes Bodie: and
therefore can in no wise be called Sacramentes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But,</hi> saithe M. Hardinge, <hi>the Accidentes Represente the likenesse of Breade: and the Breade,
that was, Representeth the Bodie of Christe.</hi> Here is an other suttle drifte of M. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinges
reason: from Accidentes, to Breade: and from Breade, to Christes Bodie.
And so wée haue here fansie vpon fansie: and one Likenes vpon an other: but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Scripture, nor Councel, nor Doctour, either Greeke, or Latine: or Olde, or
Newe, to auouche the same.</p>
               <p>But here appeareth a marueilous peruerse order in Nature. For by M. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinges
driftes, neither can the Breade Signifie Christes Bodie, but onely when
the Breade is abolished, &amp; nothing leafte to Signifie: nor can these Accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
the Breade, but onely, when there is no Breade remaininge there, to be Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified.
And so the effecte of M. Hardinges drifte, and of this Resemblance pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
from nothinge to nothinge, and standeth in nothinge.</p>
               <p>

Here it behooued M. Hardinge to haue foreseene the inconueniences, that might

But M. Hardinge saithe, <hi>Christes Bodie is in the Sacrament, without Circumscription, or

power: and the manner of his Beinge there is knowen onely vnto God.</hi> These be faire,
and orient, and bewtiful colours, but altogeather without grounde: and, to
vse the termes of M. Hardinges Religion, they are nothinge els, but Accidentes,
and Shewes without a Subiecte.</p>
               <p>It is a strange, and a marueilous mater, that this presence of Christe in the
Sacrament, beinge so certaine, and so singulare, as M. Harding seemeth to make
it, yet al the Olde Learned Catholique Fathers should so lightly passe it ouer in
silence, without any manner mention, as if it were not woorthe the hearinge: or
that M. Hardinge should so assuredly, and so certainely know it, and yet God him
selfe should not know it: Or, that God should know it, and yet, beinge a mater so
Singulare, and so necessarie to be knowen, shoulde neuer reuele the same to any,

                  <hi>Standinge:</hi> S. Paule saithe, Christe is now
at the Right hande of God, <hi>Sittinge:</hi> whiche thinge also wee confesse in the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of our Faithe. But in the Sacrament, saithe M. Hardinge, Christe is Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sente
without any manner suche Circumscription, or Circumstance, or order of
place: that is to say, as greate in quantitie, as he was vpon the Crosse, &amp; yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

of his Bodie, either vpwarde, or downewarde: or backewarde, or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde:
A very Bodie, and yet not as a Bodie: In a place, and yet not as in a place.</p>
               <p>This is M. Hardinges Catholique Doctrine, without Scripture, without
Councel, without Doctoure, without any likinge, or sense of Reason. Yet must
euery man receiue the same at M. Hardinges hande, as the Singulare, Strange,
Woonderful, Omnipotent Woorke of God.</p>
               <p>To Conclude, Christes Bodie is in the Mystical Breade of the Holy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
not Really, or Corporally, or in déede, as M. Hardinge fansieth, but as in a
Sacramente, and in a Mysterie: euen as the Bloud of Christe is in the Water of
Baptisme.</p>

               <p>Here M. Hardinge allegeth no Doctour, but Doctour Cole. And touchinge
the mater it selfe, he thinketh this errour wel excused, for that it is not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> principal
keye of his Religion. How be it, he, that in moste honorable Assemblie doubted not
openly to pronounce these woordes, <hi>I telle yovv, Ignorance is the Mother of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion,</hi>
was thought then to esteeme the same, as no smal keie of his Religion.</p>
               <p>Uerily it appeareth by the whole practise, and policie of that side, they are fully
persuaded, that without déepe Ignorance of the people, it is not possible for their
Churche to stande.</p>
               <p>Therefore they chase the Simple from the Scriptures, and drowne them in
Ignorance, and suffer them vtterly to knowe nothinge: neither the Profession,
they made in Baptisme: nor the meaninge of the holy Mysteries: nor the Price of
Christes Bloude: nor wherein, or by whom they maie be saued: nor what they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of God, either when they praie togeather in the Churche, or when they priua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely
pray alone.</p>
               <p>They shut vp the Kingedome of Heauen before menne:<note place="margin">Matthae. 23.</note> and neither wil they enter them
selues, nor suffer others, that woulde enter. <hi>And, as it is written by the Prophete Esai,
<hi>Dicunt videntibus, Nolite videre:</hi>
                  </hi> They saie vnto them, that see, Stoppe youre eies,<note place="margin">Esai. 30.</note> and

               <p>
                  <hi>Thus they walter in darkenes, and in the shadowe of Deathe. And yet, as it
is written in the Booke of Wisedome,</hi> Non satis est illis errasse circa scientiam Dei:
sed in magno viuentes inscitiae bello,<note place="margin">Sapien. 14.</note> tot &amp; tanta mala Pacem appellant: <hi>They thought it
not sufficient, to be deceiued, and blinded in the Knowledge of God: but liuinge in sutche a
Warre of ignorance, al these euilles they calle Peace, <hi>And make the people beleeue, it is
Obedience, Catholique Faithe, and Deuotion: Or rather, as Ireneus writeth
against the Ualentinian Heretiques,</hi>

of the General, and knowen vse of the Primitiue Churche, of the Anciente

your bare Gheasses, you bringe nothinge. Of your vnfruiteful manner

nor Example: Touchinge the Supremacie of Rome, whiche is the keepe, and
Castle of your whole Religion, ye wander far, and wide, and many times bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side

the bare woordes against the meaninge: sometime ye make a meaninge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

            <p>Your greatest groundes be Surmises, Gheasses, Coniectures, and likelyhoodes.
Your Argumentes be Fallacies, many times without either Moode, or Figure:

vs the Gospel, euen in like sorte, and fourme, in al respectes, as it is taught vs
now. VVee remember bothe your woordes, and also the manner, and courrage
of your vtterance. Ye tolde vs of the Paper walles, and painted Fiers of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie:
Ye saide, Rome was the sinke of Sodome: ye saide, your Masse was
a heape of Idolatrie, and the Mysterie of Iniquitie: ye wisshed your voice had
benne equal with the greate Belle of Oseney, that ye might ringe, as ye then
saide, in the duleares of the deafe Papistes. Noman was so vehement, and so
earnest, as you. The whole Vniuersitie, and Citie of Oxforde, the Crosse at
Paules, and other like places of greate concourse can wel recorde it. Ye bade vs
then beleeue you vpon your credite: and wee beleeued you. The Prince died:
an other was placed. Suddainely ye had quite forgotten al, that ye had
taught vs before: and had as suddainely learned other thinges, al contrary to
the former: whiche, ye tolde vs, ye neuer knew before: and yet, with one face,
and one conscience, ye required vs earnestly to beleeue you stil, euen as we had
donne before. As though your bare woorde were the rule of our Faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and,
what so euer you shoulde saye, true, or false, wee simple people were bounde of
necessitie to beleeue you. How be it, wee thinke, if ye telle vs trueth now,
then ye deceiued vs before: if ye tolde vs Trueth before, then ye deceiue vs
now. And thus it cannot be denied, but this way, or that way, ye haue decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
vs. And how may wee know, whether you speake, as you thinke, or
dissemble with vs now,<note place="margin">Iacob. 1.</note> as ye did before? Surely S. Iames sheweth vs, <hi>That
a man of double minde is euer vnconstante in al his vvaies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VVee marueiled, how ye coulde atteine to al this Doctrine, specially in
so short a time: but moste of al, in suche perfection. For, the Scriptures are
large: and wee heare say, the Councelles are sundrie: the Doctours Volumes
are longe, and many. So suddainely in seuen daies, to reade them al, and so
to reade them, it was not possible. You may by your eloquence persuade vs
many thinges. But this one thinge ye can neuer persuade vs. You wanted
time: it is not credible: it was not possible. Therefore ye must needes say, ye
were taught these thinges, euen as the Prophetes were, by Reuelation.</p>
            <p>If any of al your olde hearers, woulde thus put you in remembrance, alas
what answeare coulde you make him?</p>
            <p>But, it was not you, M. Hardinge: it was the time. If the time had beene
one, you had stil continued one. But ye were forced to know, that ye knewe
not: and to thinke, that ye thought not: and so, to beleeue, that ye beleeued
not. How be it, S Hilarie saithe, <hi>Quae ex necessitate est, Fides no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> est:
