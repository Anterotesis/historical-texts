         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas Colonell <hi>Owen O Neill,</hi> coming into this Kingdome, under pretence of ſerving his Majeſtie, and his faithfull Subiects the Confederate Catholicks, hath been by the Supreme Councell in <hi>Anno</hi> one thouſand ſix hundred fourty and two, advanced unto the places of Generall and Governor of the Province of <hi>Vlſter,</hi> and upon receiving of his Pattent of thoſe imployments of great honour, truſt &amp; command, ſolemnely tooke the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Aſſociation</hi> uſually taken by the Confederate Catholicks. And alſo an Oath to diſcharge thoſe places with that ſincerity to the publicke, and obedience to the Government, as became a perſon ſo highly intruſted. Nevertheleſſe the ſaid <hi>Owen O Neill,</hi> in breach of the ſaid truſt, having propoſed unto himſelfe by the force of the Army under his command, to deſtroy the preſent, and to introduce a new and Tyrannicall Government over the Lives, Eſtates and Liberties of his Maieſties faithfull Subiects, and to alienate them from their loyalty to the Crowne of <hi>England,</hi> hath without warrant or authority contrary to the Lawes of the Land, and the eſtablishments of all Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blyes of the Confederate Catholicks made and appointed commanders in chiefe, ſeverall Lieutenant Generalls, Colonells, and other inferiour commanders throughout the Kingdome, to raiſe Horſe and Foote; gathered and aſſembled together, all ſuch as hee thought inclined to his wayes of deſtruction, to whom for their better encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hee gave them libertie of plunder, and pillage, who did accordingly, actually pillage, plunder, and rob his Maieſties Subiects in the Provinces of <hi>Leinſter, Mounſter,</hi> and <hi>Connaght,</hi> and poſſeſſed himſelfe and his party, of their Caſtles and Holts as by woefull experience theſe five years paſt, the inhabitants of the ſaid Provinces have found.</p>
            <p>And in purſuance of his wicked, and trayterous deſignes, and to the end to bring the ſame to a full period, being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto encouraged through the want of due and timely punishment for his paſt offences and high miſdemeanors, hath this preſent yeare shaked off, all manner of obedience to the Government eſtablished among the Confederate Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks; ioyned with <hi>Colonell Jones,</hi> a Parliamentary, and adverſe to his Maieſty, and the ſaid Confederate Catholicks; And in an hoſtile and rebellious manner marched with his ſaid Army, killing, burning, pillaging, plundering &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying his Maieſties faithfull Subiects, beſiged and tooke by force of Armes divers of his Maieſties Caſtles, Forts, and ſtrong holts, committed and perpetrated all other Acts of hoſtility and treaſon. And notwithſtanding that all wayes, and meanes poſſible tending to the ſafety and quiet of the Kingdome, have been uſed by the Supreme Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell entruſted with the Goverment for the reducing and reclaiming of the ſaid <hi>Owen O Neill,</hi> and his complices from thoſe his wicked, mallicious, and trayterous Acts. Yet ſo farre was hee fixed upon thoſe his reſolutions, as hee would not admit any addreſſe to bee made unto him, as by burning of the Councells letters ſent to him and others the ſaid Commanders of his Army, and menaces to hang the meſſenger if he had come with any more meſſages to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and other proofes appeareth, much leſſe give care or agree to any manner of accommodation, other then ſuch as muſt of neceſſity prove deſtructive to Religion, King, and Countrey, as by an exact accompt given to this Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly by the Supreme Councell of their proceedings, and by the ſeverall other proofes &amp; teſtimonies, otherwiſe knowne to this Aſſembly plainely and manifeſtly appeareth.
