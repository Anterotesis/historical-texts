            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>TO remind the Nation of the Rise, Progress and mischievous Designs of our Blood-thirsty <hi>Iacobites,</hi> I think sit to lay open and declare to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and the World, an exact Account of the late accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Conspiracy,<note place="margin">Pag. 1.</note> which was actually form'd and carried on in <hi>France</hi> against His Sacred Majesty's Life, and against
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60129:3"/>
the Peaceable and Flourishing Government of His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty's Kingdoms; as far forth as hitherto the Particulars of it have come to my knowledg, by the Voluntary Confessions and undeniable Convictions of divers of the Principal Conspirators.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 2.</note>And I shall here faithfully present the Plain matter of Fact; whereby I doubt not but wholly to put to silence the Malicious Insinuations of Factious Men, who have hitherto had the Artifice to support and encourage their Party by Impudent Slanders and Falshoods, against the clearest Light and most evident Proof: And I heartily wish that this may tend to confirm the Loyalty and good Affections of His Majesty's Subjects at Home, and to establish Abroad the Reputation and Honour of his Royal Justice.</p>
            <p>And moreover (which I hope your Lordship and I shall ever regard) this publick and lasting Testimony will be given of our sincere thankfulness to Almighty God, for that Miraculous Deliverence from a Danger which came so near His Majesty's Sacred Person, and was so far spread in the Ruin it threatn'd to all his People.</p>
            <p>It is well known what Mischievous Arts of late Years have been used, and what Treasonable Courses taken, to whithdraw these Nations from their bounden Duty and Allegiance; and to expose His Majesty's most Just and Merciful Goverment to Calumny and Contempt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:60129:3"/>This Rebellious Design has been apparently carried on by Male-contents, whose Crimes or Wants, whose furious Zeal or unbounded Ambition inclin'd them to wish for a Disturbance of the Peace and Prosperity of these Nations.</p>
            <p>To this wicked purpose, many the very same fatal Methods and specious Pretences which had heretofore involved these Kingdoms in Confusion and Blood, were again reviv'd: and by many of the very same Persons; Men of Crafty, restless and implacable Spirits; Impenitent after the most Gracious Pardons; whom long Experience had made skillful in seducing weak and unstable Minds by Counterfeiting the Plausible Names of things in themselves most Excellent, but most Dangerous when abused.</p>
            <p>By these wretched Instruments was His Majesty's most Gentle and Benign Government reproch'd; Sedition was every where promoted to destroy our present Tranquility; Desperate Speeches (such as Sir <hi>Iohn Knight</hi>'s, of <hi>Bristol</hi> and others); Infamous Libels, Traiterous Books swarm'd in all Places, and the worst of all unchristian Principles were put in practice.</p>
            <p>From these Preparations to a Rebellion,<note place="margin">Pag. 4.</note> the Party began by degrees to proceed to Action; Distinctions of Sides were made; Names and Tokens of Seperation were given; Illegal Conventicles were maintain'd, in Defiance of the Laws of God and Man; Tumultuous Feasts and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60129:4"/>
Factious Clubs were set up in City and Country. Close and Seditious Meetings haunted. Frequent Cabals appointed, and by Men of High degree with the lowest; Great Stores of Arms provided by private Persons.<note place="margin">Pag. 5.</note> Insolent Progresses made through divers Countries; thereby to glory in their Numbers, and to carry far and near the the Terrour of their Power, and even to Muster their Party for some sudden Blow and General Insurrection.</p>
            <p>All these and many more such Personal Indignities and Publick Assaults, on the Government, his Majesty long endured with the same Mildness and Clemency where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he had already forgiven the highest Crimes against himself; His Royal Goodness still patiently expecting and wishing, that in time the most obstinate of his misguided Subjects would see their Error, and return at length to a sense of the Duty they owe him, by all the strongest Bonds of Nature and Laws, Religion and Gratitude that can possibly oblige Subjects towards a Sovereign.</p>
            <p>But when His Majesty was abundantly convinc'd that all those dark Consultations and open Tumults of unruly Men, were but so many Infallible Signs and Fore-runners of Rebellion, or some extraordinary Commotions, then, at last,<note place="margin">Pag. 6.</note> in a tender respect to his People's Safety, more than to his own, was his Majesty constrain'd to awaken his Authority, to try what good Effect the Vigour of his Laws would have on those Offenders, with whom his repeated Mercy and Indulgence had so little prevailed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:60129:4"/>And such was His Majesty's good Fortune, that the disaffected had been found impotent in their repeated Attempts to set up Sheriffs of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Middlesex,</hi> to pack Juries to serve their purpose; so that whilst his Majesty carefully endeavoured to distribute Impartial Justice to all his Subjects, he very happily obtained the same Right himself, and the Number of his Enemies was found very inconsiderable, in those very places where their Desperate Enterprizes against the Government, were likely to be most sudden and pernicious.</p>
            <p>Amongst divers other famous Examples of this Nature was that of <hi>Charnock, King</hi> and <hi>Keys,</hi> for these Criminals were very considerable, for their audacious Forwardness in carrying on the execrable Design against His Majesty's Life, for which they were brought to a fair and Legal Tryal,<note place="margin">Pag. 7.</note> and His Majesty procured Justice to be done, without removing the Process into another County, for here (the Jacobite Party being no way powerful) that old Damnable Opinion and Practice of the Lawfulness of Equivocating, and even of Perjury, for the Support of their Good Old Cause, had not prevailed over the Old and Honest English Principles of Truth and Honour.</p>
            <p>Thus His Majesty's Justice got the better at this time and is in little danger of being defeated in a greater and more important Instance,<note place="margin">Pag. 9.</note> should even any Peer of the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60129:5"/>
Realm, not only be reasonably suspected, but in the Issue manifestly discovered to have been an Author or Manager, of those Traiterous Contrivances against His Majesty's Crown and Life, for even such a Person will find he is not under the Protection of Juries of his own Appoinment or Approbation; and therefore may not presume that he stands out of the reach of His Majesty's just Indignation; for should he be Legally Indicted of Crimes of the Highest Nature, on clear and positive Evidence; he will undoubtedly be brought to a Lawful Tryal by his Peers, and the Indictment not be Stifled by a shamful <hi>Ignoramus,</hi> for at this Day His Majesty has gain'd this very considerable Advantage, that he plainly perceives the strength of all his Enemies Arrogance lyes not now, as heretofore, in their extravagant Power to pack the City Juries. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now may not even a Lord Securely project,<note place="margin">Pag. 10.</note> or a <hi>Ferguson</hi> write, or a Confederacy act against the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; they not having Sheriffs and a Settled Club at hand, with their Corrupt Pannels to indempnify, and to second and applaud their most Villainous Practices; And His Majesty seems resolv'd, at length, after a many intollerable Provocations, to strike at that which he has now found to be the very Root of the Faction, and not to suffer an ill Party of Men to destroy his Government, as they might have done,<note place="margin">Pag. 11.</note> had they been suffered to go on never so little farther uncontrouled; and it is not to be
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60129:5"/>
doubted but the Righteousness of His Majesty's Cause will meet with an answerable Success; and that so many guilty Persons will not escape unpunished,<note place="margin">Pag. 12.</note> who were just at the point of bringing their devilish Purposes to a quick Issue, and once for all to strike boldly at the Heart of the King and Kingdom.</p>
            <p>But to proceed to the History of the Times; this Conspiracy was resolved upon by the <hi>French King,</hi> and the late King <hi>Iames,</hi> in <hi>Ianuary</hi> last: and for the carrying of it on, the Duke of <hi>Berwick</hi> and others were sent into <hi>England,</hi> to concert the grand Point of the Assassination. Their Party thenceforth gave over all their quieter and more plausible Arts of Sedition, and betook themselves to more precipitate Enterprizes: inflaming some to Insurrections, others to Assassinations. They proudly brag'd throughout the Nation that, the late King <hi>Iames</hi> would be here within a Month, Nay they offered to lay Wagers, that within that time we should have a New Lord Keeper, and Mr. <hi>F.</hi> was to be the Man. They bought up Horses and Arms in all Parts of the Kingdom, at the same time using innumerable Deceits to alienate the minds of His Majesty's Subjects from His Government. Their pretended Protestant Clergy, both <hi>Iurors</hi> and <hi>Non-Iurors,</hi> talked, at this time, very imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently of the horrid Murder of King <hi>Charles</hi> the First, insinuating the Abdication of <hi>Iames</hi> the Second to be of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60129:6"/>
the same Complexion: They ridicul'd the Popish Plot in 1678, that theirs of 1695 might be less credited; They took occasion to exclaim against the Rebellion in 1641, and of the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s, not sticking to represent the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s glorious Expedition parallel thereto. At other times under Umbrage of great Loyalty to King <hi>William,</hi> many of them declaim'd of the Divine Right of Kings, and of their unaccountableness on this side Heaven, from whence this wicked Inference was made, that the late <hi>King Iames</hi> still remains their rightful King.</p>
            <p>Such Practices as these were found by evident Proof, to have been the Principal Rise and Occasion of ripening the horrid Conspiracy in this Nation.<note place="margin">Pag. 13.</note> As for his Majesty's Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> it is Notorious there has been long Shelter'd in it a desperate Faction of furious Zealots, that under the Notion of Prelatists were growing up by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to a Violation, at last, not only of all the Rules and Institutions of true Religion, but of Common Humanity. Have they not proceeded to all the execrable Rage of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine aud Violence?<note place="margin">Pag. 14.</note> Their Principles are not yet entirely extinguish'd, tho their Force has been Vanquish'd in open Field, by God's Provindence prospering His Majesty's Arms. It is certain also, the Peace of that Kingdom has been much endangered by other Factious and Seditious Spirits, who, tho at first they would not venture to encourage publickly
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60129:6"/>
the Treason, yet stuck not secretly to favour and foment their Cause, and would soon have own'd and headed the furious Traitors, had the Plot prospered.</p>
            <p>By this brief Recollection of the Troubled State of Affairs,<note place="margin">Pag. 20.</note> and the tumultuous temper of ill Men's Minds, in His Majesty's Kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> about the time when this Treasonable Conspiracy was in Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, the Impartial World may perceive from what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive Seeds of Sedition, private Passions and Animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities, under the disguise of Religion and the Publick Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, so Monstrous a Birth was produced.</p>
            <p>In the wonderful Discovery of which detestable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy, and in the happy prevention of its dire Effects; as all who have heard of it must acknowledg, that a signal care of God's Providence has appear'd for His Majesty and these Nations preservation: so it must be acknowledged by all, that nothing has been done on his Majesties Part, but what was agreeable to that Royal Benignity and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Candor of his whole Life whereof all the World, even his Enemies, have had such undoubted Experience</p>
            <p>Much of the Evidence was deliver'd in His Majesty's own presence. The Examinations were taken by Men of unquestionable Reputation and Honour. The whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings has been managed with all imaginable Integrity. There has been no straining or extorting of Accusations to blemish the Fame of the Innocent:<note place="margin">Pag. 21.</note> No Temptations of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60129:7"/>
Rewards proposed: no Pardon assured before-hand, for discovering or aggravating the Crimes of the Guilty.</p>
            <p>Some Witnesses who offer'd themselves, of whom there might have been any colourable Suspition, were wholly rejected: Lest it should once again happen that the bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted Credit or needy Condition, or Profligate Lives of the Persons deposing, should derogate from the strength of their Depositions, and administer any the least doubt of Subornation.</p>
            <p>Those Witnesses His Majesty admitted had been ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally Men strongly prepossessed in Conscience, Zeal and Interest for that Party; Men whose former avow'd Hatred of the Government, was reason sufficient to gain them an absolute Trust with any who studied to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw it. They were not of desperate Fortunes, nor despicable Men; for the most part they seperatly and singly brought in their Discoveries. Divers of them had little or no Conversation or Familiarity one with another. There was no shadow or possibility of a Combination between them all to discover;<note place="margin">Pag. 22.</note> yet such is the prevalence of self Conviction, and so great the Power of Truth, that all their several Discoveries did perfectly agree with themselves and with each other, in all Material Parts and Circumstances.</p>
            <p>It was therefore in the Year 1695, a time when all His Majesty's Dominons enjoyed a settled Peace and profound

Security, whilst the greatest part of the Neighbouring World was involved in Wars and Combustions; that his Majesty and his Council were suddenly awaken'd with the surprizing Knowledg of this dreadful Conspiracy, which had been laying very deep and broad for many Months before.</p>
            <p>The Man whom God chose to make the first Discoverer was Mr. <hi>Prendergast,</hi> a Person of good Credit in his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, but otherwise a most perverse Papist, and fiercely addicted to their Cause, and one of the busiest Sticklers against the Government. He by his approved Activity and Violence for the French Interest, was Judg'd by the Chief Conspirators fitly qualified to be admitted into their most private Consultations;<note place="margin">Pag. 23.</note> and accordingly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after they trusted him as one of their surest Confidents. Insomuch that he was invited to make one of those 40 Miscreants, whose proper part it was to Assassinate his Majesty's Person.</p>
            <p>Of which Number, after he had freely consented to be, and had met and acted joyntly with therest for some time, to prepare the cursed Work for a speedy Execution; It pleased the Divine Goodness so to touch his Soul with the Horrour of so amazing a Crime,<note place="margin">Pag. 24.</note> that he determined to discharge his Conscience of the Hellish Secret.</p>
            <p>Wherefore he immediately resolved to prevent the Mischief of the following Day, by giving his Majesty
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60129:8"/>
timely Notice: accordingly he went and acquainted the Earl of <hi>Portland</hi> with the Design, who communicated the whole Matter to His Majesty, who at his return told him the King would speak with him.</p>
            <p>On Friday Night the 14<hi>th</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> he went to <hi>Kensington,</hi> and was introduced to His Majesty by the Earl of <hi>Portland,</hi> and laid before him his whole Knowledg of this Diabolical Conspiracy.</p>
            <p>But the intended Assassination, upon the first disclosing of it, appeared to be so prodigious a Barbarity that His Majesty for some time gave but very little Ear and slow Credit to this Information, as little suspecting as deserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such Usage from the worst of His Subjects.</p>
            <p>Which generous Caution, that His Majesty took not to be imposed upon by new Rumours of Plots, and His Gracious Tenderness not to believe so ill of his very Enemies, but upon certain Demonstration, was one of the Chief Occasions that the Duke of <hi>Berwick</hi> and divers others of the principal Agitators and Managers of the whole Business took the Alarm,<note place="margin">Pag. 25.</note> and got time to scatter aud withdraw beyond the Seas.</p>
            <p>However, by God's Providence continually watching over His Majesty's and these Nations Safety, so many of the Traytors soon after fell into the Hands of Justice, who did voluntarily acknowledg their being Partakers of the Treason, or were convicted of it by evident Proof, that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60129:8"/>
henceforth whoever shall pretend not to believe the Truth of the whole, they must either be such as were Parties in the Design, or so monstrously unreasonable as to believe there never can be a real Plot against any Prince or State, but what does actually succeed and take effect.</p>
            <p>Thus much is certain of this Conspirary, and it is so remarkable and extraordinary, that perhaps the like cannot be affirmed of any other mentioned in all History, that there was scarce a man Attainted or Executed for it, who did not more or less add some new light to the several parts of the Dark Contrivance, either by a plain confession of it, or by the very manner of dening it, and by the weakness of the Subterfuges, whereby they endeavoured to palliate their Crimes.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole matter, tho it is not doubted but the Treasonable Infection was in some degree or other spread into most parts of these Kingdoms,<note place="margin">Pag. 26.</note> amongst the Ring leaders of the Jacobite Clubs, and lawless Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles in Town and Countrey. Yet I declare an utter Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence that bare Suspitions, though never so probably grounded, should prevail to conclude any Man guilty, and therefore resolve to make no reflection on the Fame of any, but only Such whose Part in it was made out by positive Testimony.</p>
            <p>And in the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> the Persons who are already Judicially found to have been deeply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60129:9"/>
as Actors, some in the Insurrection part, others in the Assassination, divers of them in both together, are these.</p>

            <p>Capt. <hi>George Porter,</hi> who had always been a busy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moter of Popish and Slavish Projects for overturning our Church and State; and was therefore for a time a great Favourite of the Disaffected:<note place="margin">Pag. 28.</note> Whilst he was imprisoned with Capt. <hi>Goodman,</hi> Maj. <hi>Matthews,</hi> Capt. <hi>Shevery, Rhoads,</hi> a Trumpeter, and the rest of the <hi>Drury-Lane</hi> Trayterous Riotors, in <hi>Iune</hi> 1695.

But finding the Hellish Design to be dispointed and Discover'd, on Sunday the 23<hi>d</hi> of <hi>February</hi> (the Day after the Fatal Blow was to have been given,) God permited him to become his own Executioner, and he shot himself into the Head, not venturing to give His Majesty time to make use of the excellent Goodness of his Nature.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>William Parkyns,</hi> a Person carried away beyond his Duty and Allegiance into this Trayterous Enterprize, by a vain Air of Popish Principles; whereby he was the more easily seduc'd by the Wicked Teachers of that most Unchristian Doctrine which has been the Cause of so many Rebellions, and was so conformable to his Antichristian Education, That it is Lawful to cut the Throat of a Protestant Prince.</p>

where according to the Corrupt Fashion of the Times, the most Profligate Persons of all Conditions were wont openly to Arraign the Monarchy, and Vilifie the Church, under the fair Shews of amending both and a tender Concernment for the Publick Good.

            <p>But of all the Conspirators,<note place="margin">Pag. 37.</note> the Man to whom belonged the Cheif Place and Precedence in the whole Diabolical Design, was <hi>Robert Ferguson,</hi> a Scotch Man; he had long brandished his poysonous Tongue and viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60129:11"/>
Pen against the Government. He is manifestly convicted to have had a hand in the most Scandalous Libels of these Times, and was particularly cherished and magnified by the Party, for his peculiar Talent in aspersing the Government and reviling His Majesty's Person; so that upon all Accounts of his restless Spirit, fluent Tongue,<note place="margin">Pag. 38.</note> subtile Brain, and Hellish Malice, he was perfectly qualified to be the great Incendiary and common Agitator of the whole Conspiracy; and it cannot be deny'd but he was the Life and Soul of all, especially for the carrying on of the whole Design.</p>
            <p>These Persons appear hitherto, to have been the Principal Contrivers or Instruments of the whole Treason in the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Divers others there are, concerning whom more than conjectural Proofs may be given of their having been engaged in it, but I chuse to spare particular Names, as far as may stand with the necessary and just Vindication of the Government.</p>
            <p>It may suffice, that of these here mentioned the World is abundantly satisfied that the several Shares they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took in this Conspiracy, were very agreeable to their former well-known perverse Principles and declared Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affections to the Government.</p>
            <p>It is therefore certain, that in the Year 1695, a time when the French King's Affairs were reduc'd to the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60129:11"/>
heighth of Desparation, this Diabolical Design of Assassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating His Majesty came afresh to be agitated,<note place="margin">Pag. 39.</note> and the whole Factious Interest, in and about the Town, nay throughout the three Kingdoms, prepar'd to employ the main of their Power and Craft for overturning the Government.</p>
            <p>All which time nothing was omitted by the Disloyal Citizens, who were no way Numerous, and a Multitude of Strangers unduly mingled with them in their Clubs, to terrify the Loyal, and gain over the timerous Members of the City; and a new and Devillish Invention was much in Vogue, by which they made the Swearing to the Government to be only an Instrument for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting their ungodly Designs.</p>
            <p>All sorts of Arms, never before known to be procured in such quantities by private Persons, such as Blunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were carefully sought after and bought up. The most improbable and villainous false Rumors, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with too many of our Pulpits, with equal Industry and Malice design'd to poison our unthinking People, filled every Street.</p>
            <p>My Lord (for tho I have insensibly slid into a tedious Letter, I may not forget to whom I address this) I take the freedom to reflect on the Stile of Modern Sermons, which, my Lord, you know, are or ought to be serious Things, and, to be confined to the Rules
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60129:12"/>
of strict and sober Truth. When the Clergy find or make occasion to discourse of Princes, one would think the Subject Matter should teach them Moderation and Temperance, Decorum and Decency; but I shall evince that some have little regarded Truth or Manners: and for the performing it, shall not ransack many Sermons, but give your Lordship a Taste of the Fraternity's Goodly Method of disparaging and reproaching His Majesty, and of their fine knack at Representation and Character, and that from your Lordship's next Neighbour, and a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendary of your Church of <hi>VVestminster,</hi> I mean the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Dr. <hi>Birch,</hi> who with his effronted Forehead (tho then His Majesty's Chaplain) began, and that very early, to sound the Trumpet to Rebellion; and that before the August Assembly of the Nation's Representatives, in his lewd Harangue on the 30<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1693, for which, by surprise, Sir <hi>T. D.</hi> obtain'd an Order of the House of Commons, that he and Mr. <hi>H.</hi> (who was soon after expell'd for Bribery) should return the Doctor Thanks, and desire him to print his Sermon; which they accordingly did; and so the World became Obliged by these high and extraordinary Flights.</p>
            <p>We (quoth His Majesty's Chaplain) are still threatned in their Turn, either with no Church at all, or the worst among Christians. Are not our very Blessings turn'd into a Curse? Our Boasted Freedom is now only
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60129:12"/>
a Liberty to bite and devour one another. Our long cry'd up Liberty of Conscience, proves one of Impiety Licentiousness, and Errour, and at best serves for a Step to Dominion more than Devotion. Our Laws are indeed open, but to the continual Conspiracies of false Witnesses against the Lives and Fortunes of the Innocent. Ours (proceeds the Doctor) is the first State-Schism known in the World.</p>
            <p>We have (says he) entailed upon us Disputed Titles; and for ought yet appears endless Wars. We are fallen into those Dregs of Time, wherein Hypocrisy and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneness seem to divide the World between them; and all true and unaffected Piety is out of Countenance; wherein all the Sacred Tyes to our King and Country appear as loose as our Manners. If then we dare own discouraged Vertue, and would stand in the Gap to save the whole from Destruction, the true way is not to follow a Multitude to do Evil, or to joyn in those Fashionable Flatteries that are ruine to the Embracers.</p>
            <p>My good Lord, I appeal to You whether this vile Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course is not stufft with the most audacious Reproaches of a Crown'd Head, that were ever heard among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians; Are such rare Men as this, I beseech your Lordship, fit to be trusted with our Consciences? Now if I have not here set this bold Clergy-man in his true light, I hope I shall do it to purpose, when I tell yonr Lordship, that this
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60129:13"/>
very Doctor was seen walking in St. <hi>Iames</hi>'s Park, with that remarkable Knight Sir <hi>Iohn Fenwick,</hi> who Disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd for some Months, but was after taken at <hi>Rumney</hi> in <hi>Kent</hi>; and with a certain nameless Earl, on that very Sunday before Noon (<hi>February</hi> 23.) when their Party waited for the much long'd for News of His Majesty's Assassination. But to pass on,</p>
            <p>Not only the Pulpit but the Press was imploy'd for promoting this barbarous Design, as I shall demonstrate to your Lordship, by a few Touches out of some envenom'd Libels.</p>
            <p>The Clergy (says one of their Incendiaries) see on what Terms they stand with their renown'd Deliverer, and what great and glorious Designs he has to devour them, so soon as he has Power and Opportunity. He has as good a Will to the Church-Lands as to his Father's Crown: But he durst never put it to the Issue, lest it should discover the weakness of his Interest, for the Eyes of the Nation are open'd, They see themselves Cheated and Abus'd, and instead of Liberties and Privileges, find themselves made Tools to insatiable Ambition, and a Morsel for execrable Parricide. And it was the most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable Infatuation to have expected otherwise; that he who had Stomach enough to devour his Father, would ever Stick at preying on the Wealth, the Rights and Vitals of the Nation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:60129:13"/>Read this envenom'd Author a little farther, I entreat your Lordship. The whole Nation (proceeds he) must be sacrificed to revenge that generous Pity and Compassion which has been shewn [by the King of <hi>France</hi>] to an oppressed Prince, whom we have infinitly wrong'd. 'Tis not his Oppression but his Piety, is the Ground of this Immortal Hatred: and 'tis manifest to all, that the Noble, Princely and Christian Succour he has afforded our Injur'd King, is more provoking than all the Oppressions in the World.</p>
            <p>Another of their Emissaries says, he Challenges the whole World to produce such an Instance of Injustice, and Violation of Promises, as this pretended Saint, and Mirror of Justice has afforded us. Our Constitution both of Church and State are revers'd, and quite dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jointed, our Liberties and Properties most unjustly invaded, and more Instances of Arbitrary Power daily committed, than in several of the former Reigns. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed says this venemous Libeller, to address my self to those of my Country-men who has had the misfortune to be misled, that since they have had all their Expectations decceiv'd, themselves gull'd out of all those real Blessings of Government they formerly enjoy'd, Peace, Plenty, Liberty and Property, and all that could render a People happy, by one whom a Man would be tempted to think could never have been procreated of Human Race, void
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60129:14"/>
of all sence of Religion, Justice, Honour, and every Qualification that is apt to conciliate Love or Veneration from Mankind; who has really forfeited the Crown by his own Act, having violated the very Instrument of Government he Subcribed: One who has been the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of shedding more Christian Blood, than has been spilt in the ten Persecutions, meerly upon a sham Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Religion to us: That it is their Interest and indispensible Duty, if they have any sence of Goodness remaining to free these Nations of such a Plague and Curse, and if possible to redeem all those Blessings which have been withheld from us by his Means, by atoning God Almighty, by doing Justice to their highly injur'd King and Queen, to themselves, and to all <hi>Europe,</hi> and averting those dismal Plagues which otherwise e're long will fall upon their Heads: Otherwise let 'em do what they can, be as obstniate, malicious and revengful as they please, if they be resolv'd yet to act wickedly they shall be consumed both they and their King.</p>
            <p>All this was evidently with design to shake the Crown and undermine the true Protestant Religion; The Truth is, to such a Heighth of Arrogance were things grown on their Side, that who ever shall Indifferently reflect on the Dangerous Devices, Slanderous Reports, and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and other Violent Emotions of the whole Party that Winter, in the City and throughout the Kingdom,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60129:14"/>
they will have just cause to conclude that the Course of their Proceedings, was a daring Struggle for Victory, and a Decisive Contention for Mastery over the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Yet however cunningly the Train was laid, it took no effect but on themselves, the Noise and Rage of all their Mutinous Routs,<note place="margin">Pag. 41.</note> vanished into Air. Sir <hi>Iohn Houblon,</hi> the Lord Mayor, together with the whole Body of the Greater, Wiser and Richer Citizens understood rightly, and stuck Unmovable to the Nation's and their own true Interest.</p>
            <p>Which the Conspirators perceiving, many disaffected Lords and others withdrew from their Houses, redoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling their Exclamations of Usurpation, Tyranny, Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and what not: and still apply'd themselves with all Diligence to expedite the Rebellious Work before project<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; fancying that yet the whole City and Kingdom, would be at the <hi>French King</hi>'s Beck, and upon the hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up his Finger, would presently rise in Arms to extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate the two Brothers, Liberty and Property.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French King</hi> had set on foot a Treaty with the Disaffected in <hi>England,</hi> and sent the Duke of <hi>Berwick</hi> privily to <hi>London,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 24.</note> who held divers Meetings with the Confederates, who offer'd, that if that King would furnish 10000 Men they would make a Sturdy Commotion here.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:60129:15"/>About that time also both ways of destroying these Kingdoms were brought under their Consideration; the general way of an Insurrection,<note place="margin">Pag. 43.</note> and the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious way, as they call'd it of Assassinating the King in his return from Hunting. The Assassination was In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly promoted on all Hands in Town and Country, immediately after which the Insurrection was to follow.</p>
            <p>At last it was thought adviseable to send one to <hi>France</hi> to acquaint the late <hi>King Iames</hi> with the result of their whole Proceedings, desiring him to prevail with the <hi>French King</hi> to lend him 8000 Foot, 1000 Horse, 1000 Dragoons, and they would meet him at his Landing, at the Head of 2000 Horse; and knowing no one fitter to employ in such a Concern,<note place="margin">Pag. 45.</note> they desir'd Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi> would be the Man, because they knew him to be of a flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Tongue, and subtile Brain, and one of the Chief Contrivers and Managers of the whole Design; he readily consented to their Desire, and immediatly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for his Departure, after he had advised and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd each of them to be hearty in the Cause.</p>
            <p>Though <hi>Charnock</hi> was gone for a while, yet the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of Mischief he had left behind on the Minds of the Confederates, would not so easily vanish. They soon reflected on his last advice,<note place="margin">Pag. 51.</note> that so many having been made Conscious to the Design, they should certainly find more Safety in pushing it on boldly, than in too late
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60129:15"/>
a Retreat. Upon this immediately they recover'd their Spirits and Resolutions, which his Departure had some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what damp'd; thenceforth they renew'd their Consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations 'till his Return, which was soon after, with the Answer, That the <hi>French King</hi>'s Affairs being in such a Posture he could not at that time comply with their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, which for the present broke all their Measures.</p>
            <p>But upon the Arrival of Sir <hi>George Barclay,</hi> who after having declar'd to the Disaffected Party the Occasion of his coming, produc'd a Commission authorizing them to perpetrate the Parricide, he withal told them that the late King was retired from St. <hi>Germains</hi> to <hi>Calais,</hi> where lay a considerable Body of Troops under his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that the <hi>French King</hi> had given Orders to <hi>Bouf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleurs</hi> to draw together immediately to Imbark, as soon as the Signal was given that their Hellish Contrivance for Assassinating His Majesty's Person had taken effect: Whereupon they renew'd their Cousultations with more Vigour than before. The Principal Managers having their frequent Meetings, as also the Inferiour Instruments theirs, whilst some of each number gave secret Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the other of what was passing in their seperate Assemblies.</p>
            <p>Of the great Council;<note place="margin">Pag. 52.</note> the Consults that have been hitherto plainly testified and sworn to, were those, at the old King's-head in <hi>Leadenhall street,</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Montjoy</hi>'s in

St. <hi>Iames</hi>'s-<hi>street.</hi> The Subordinate Cabals were kept in divers other Places in and about the City of <hi>London</hi>; as in <hi>Ianuary,</hi> in that Year, at Capt. <hi>Porter</hi>'s, and at Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi>'s Lodgings in <hi>Norfolk-street:</hi> Or in common Taverns, as at the Nag's-Head in <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> the Sun in the <hi>Strand,</hi> the Globe in <hi>Hatton-Garden, &amp;c.</hi> As also on <hi>February</hi> the 14<hi>th,</hi> the very Day the Discovery was made, at the Blew-Posts in <hi>Spring-Garden</hi>; and on the 15<hi>th</hi> and 22<hi>d,</hi> at Capt. <hi>Porter</hi>'s Lodging in <hi>Maiden-lane,</hi> being both the Times agreed upon to put the Design in Execution.</p>
            <p>Their Meetings being so generally in places of publick Entertainment; therefore to prevent the Observation of Drawers and Servants, they often discours'd of their whole Bloody Business in a Canting Language of their own making.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:60129:16"/>But for the most part when they were free and among themselves,<note place="margin">Pag. 54.</note> they did discourse of the whole Contrivance in plain Language, and without Reserve; their common Healths were such as these, <hi>To the Restoring the late King</hi> James, the Health of the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> the <hi>late Queen,</hi> and the <hi>French King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when <hi>Harris, Lowick,</hi> and others, who were less harden'd in Cruelty, express'd some kind of Consternati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Dread of the Consequences of so dire a Stroak,<note place="margin">Pag. 55.</note> readily declar'd themselves willing to joyn in the Insur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, but shrunk a little at first at the Horror of the Assassination; they said tho it was a Barbarous Work, yet they would obey Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi>'s Orders.</p>
            <p>In these their private Cabals, the Matters they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscuously treated of, were either a general Insurrection or the Assassination of the King's Person.<note place="margin">Pag. 56.</note> Of the Assassination divers ways were consulted, 'till they fix'd on that Lane coming form <hi>Brentford</hi> to <hi>Turnham-Green.</hi> The Insurrection was propos'd to be made at the same time in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland.</hi> The adjusting that part of it which related to <hi>Scotland</hi> was chiefly under the Care and manag'd by Commissioners appointed for that purpose, by the French King and the late King <hi>Iames,</hi> as well as this in <hi>England</hi>; all which Particulars are Circumstantially set forth, so often repeated, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrably confirm'd in the ensuing Evidences, that it
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60129:17"/>
will be sufficient here only to direct the Reader's Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation by given a brief Summary of the whole.</p>
            <p>Towards an in Insurrection throughout <hi>England,</hi> they laid the greatest Stress on the City of <hi>London</hi>; not doubting but if that was once secured to them, the rest of the Nation would of Course fall in.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 57.</note>For the increasing their Numbers, and drawing in New Converts this one General Rule was carefully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, that the bottom of the Design should in the beginning be warily conceal'd from all Persons with whom they treated. First their Inclinations were to be tried by gradual Insinuations, and plausible Discourses at a Distance, till they had gain'd a full assurance of their Fidelity. They were to be ask'd, <hi>If they would be concern'd, in Easing them from the Yoke that laid upon 'em?</hi> Meaning to murder King <hi>William</hi>; when it was Answer'd, <hi>They would readily assist in any thing of that Nature:</hi> Then it was next to be demanded, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they would contribute the Assistance of their Persons or Purses, or both?</hi> That being also determined, It was to be farther inquired, <hi>What Furniture of Arms, Horses, and Money they had in readiness? What Friends they could engage?</hi> And if these Questions were resolved ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Minds,<note place="margin">Pag. 58.</note> then the whole Mystery of the Villainy was to be frankly disclos'd. They were to be told in down-right Terms, That their Design was to As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sassinate
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60129:17"/>
the Person of King <hi>William</hi> in order to fix King <hi>Iames</hi> again in the Throne, to which if they would lend their Assistance it would answer their Expectation. He having already sent over several Men and Money to buy Horses to help to do the Work.</p>
            <p>The way being thus made to sound and prepare the Dispositions of ill Men for any Violent Enterprize; the next thing came under deliberation was Money.<note place="margin">Pag. 59.</note> For that several of the Conspirators declar'd, they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable sums of their Own, or deposited with them, which were ready, and might be call'd for on Occasion. That Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi> subscribed Money, enough to furnish 40 Horses, likewise Sir <hi>Iohn Friend</hi> offered if the late K. <hi>Iames</hi> would give order for it, to disburst 3000 <hi>l.</hi> that the Cause might not be lost. Neither was Sir <hi>W. Parkyns,</hi> with many others slack in making provision for a sudden Push, for they if the Business succeeded were in Hopes to satisfy their thirsty Appetites and inrich themselves with the Blood and Estates of just and honest Men.</p>
            <p>The next necessary Provision they debated on was Arms. And it is notoriously known, the whole Party had been gathering great abundance of all sorts.<note place="margin">Pag. 60.</note> All probably with the same prospect and in the same pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion for their parts in the Conspiracy as Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi> had done for his, though they happened not all
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60129:18"/>
to be so manifestly detected; for not long after the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy was discover'd to His Majesty and His Ministers: the said Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi> was found to have by him, hid under-ground by his Garden-Wall, several Chests of compleat Arms, belonging as he pretended to his Country-House, where no thought of Robbery or As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault could be fear'd; and by consequence, there could not be the least shadow or pretence that they were laid in there for his own lawful use or defence.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 61.</note>But besides these Stores, which they had every one made for themselves, it was resolved, at the very first News of the late King <hi>Iames</hi>'s Landing with his Cut-Throat Army to be in readiness, some to attempt the publick Magazines in and about the City, whilst others in the remote Parts, were to use their utmost Diligence to form themselves into a Body and join the Invasion.</p>
            <p>Many Thoughts were also spent how to engage the Sea-Men to their Side: Tho it must be said that their Practices with them met with the least Success of any. Nor is it imaginable, the brave Race of <hi>English</hi> Mariners should ever prove false to His Majesty, who has cherish'd, encourag'd and promoted that Profession more than all the Kings of <hi>England</hi> have done since the Conquest:<note place="margin">Pag. 62.</note> His Majesty well understanding that the Safety, Riches and Honour of this Kingdom depend most on its Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratime Greatness.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:60129:18"/>However, the Conspirators not in the least doubting but they should have sufficient Numbers, as soon as their Friends were arrived from <hi>France,</hi> to make a Stand, and give time to others to come in, and declare; their Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvouses were appointed in most of the convenient Posts of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Westminster</hi>; whence they might at once attack the <hi>Bridg,</hi> the <hi>Exchanges,</hi> the <hi>Guards,</hi> the <hi>Savoy, Whitehall</hi> and the <hi>Tower:</hi> And they had ready in Town and Country a considerable number of Officers to head and govern the mixt Multitude as soon as they should appear in Arms.</p>
            <p>At the same time, a Party was to be ready to scowr the Streets, and immediately Barricadoes were to be made: The Horses of <hi>Hackney-Coaches,</hi> and other Strangers, were to be seiz'd on: The Horse-Guards not actually Mounted to be surpriz'd in their several Stables: For which end a Committee was chose, who undertook to vew the Posture of their Quarters, and reported back to the Principals that the seizing 'em was a thing very fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ferguson</hi> had also often assur'd them he could promise for a considerable Number of Men to be ready at a day,<note place="margin">Pag. 63.</note> and that he would make one of the same Party himself.</p>
            <p>Upon supposition of this Strength, their principal aim being to surprize the <hi>Tower,</hi> as a Place most able to annoy them, and where there lay great Magazines of Stores of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60129:19"/>
Ammunition to furnish them; they had many Debates on that Subject.<note place="margin">Pag. 64.</note> And it is very well known they had brought an Officer in Trust therein to be of their Party, who was to deliver the <hi>Tower</hi> into their Hands.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 65.</note>Besides securing to themselves by these means the Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Westminster,</hi> which was their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Care; they had also under Consideration the raising Commotions at the same time in divers other Parts of <hi>England:</hi> Especially those Counties of the <hi>West</hi> and <hi>North,</hi> in which they believ'd the <hi>Iacobite</hi> Party to be most Numerous, and most inclin'd to their Factious Interest.</p>
            <p>In every County some one Great Man was to put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self at the head of the Rebellion, and divers of them had their proper Stations appointed.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>North</hi> they depended on a numerous Assistance, having been inform'd, by Sir <hi>William Parkyns,</hi> who had made a Journey into that part of the Kingdom, that the <hi>North</hi> was as well inclin'd to their Party as the <hi>West.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 66.</note>Most Sea-Port Towns of any considerable Strength was to be attempted, particularly <hi>Portsmouth,</hi> by some going into the Town on pretence of seeing the Place, at the same time another Party coming in on the Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, disguiz'd like Country-men, and both together were to fall on the Guards.</p>
            <p>At the same time when they were making these Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations for an Insurrection, the other Design of Assassina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting His Majesty kept equal Pace with it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:60129:19"/>It is manifest that the <hi>French King</hi> and late King <hi>Iames,</hi> had often devised his Majesty's Murder; it being indeed a Talent peculiar to them both to murder Princes, and lay their Nations in Blood and Confusion. That of all Men living they can most easily turn themselves into all Shapes, and comply with all Dispositions, to get Agents to compass their Damnable Purposes; having by long practice, got the skill to cover their Hooks with Baits fitting every Humour. The Covetous, who are no small Number of their <hi>Iacobite</hi> Party,<note place="margin">Pag. 67.</note> those they feed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive with hopes of Wealth and new Sequestrations: The Ambitious, with Praise and Vain-Glory: The Church of <hi>England,</hi> with Promises of Liberty and Religion: Sometimes not refusing to stoop lower, and even to serve and assist the Pleasures and Debauches of Men that way inclin'd, if they find them any way useful for their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses.</p>
            <p>And now also upon this Occasion,<note place="margin">Pag. 68.</note> divers Ways of performing the Assassination were debated; one was to make the Attempt on His Majesty, as He came from <hi>Richmond</hi> by the <hi>Road.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another when He was upon Horse-back at <hi>Cue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another to Surprize Him by Ambuscade as He was diverting Himself with Shooting or Hunting in the Park by <hi>Richmond.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:60129:20"/>But of these Propositions Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi> approv'd of none like the last mention'd, in order to which he desir'd Capt. <hi>Porter</hi> to go with Mr. <hi>Knightly</hi> to View the Ground; accordingly they went, and Mr. <hi>King</hi> with them: At their return made their Report: <hi>That the Lane between</hi> Brentford <hi>and</hi> Turnham-Green <hi>to be much more Feasible to dispatch the Business, or do the Trick,</hi> as they call'd it.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 69.</note>The Account they gave of the Commodiousness of the Lane for any such desperate Enterprize soon incourag'd them to fix it there. It being a Place lonely and retired, with a River on one Side and Pales on the other, which would afford all Advantages imaginable to the Assailants, and give as great Inconveniences to the Persons Attack'd.</p>
            <p>The Place being agreed on, it was first question'd, <hi>Whether the Stroak should be struck upon His Majesty's going to, or coming from Hunting:</hi> But it was thought more expedient <hi>to defer it 'till His Majesty's return.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That Point being over, they had several Meetings, to consult of all the Circumstances of the Parricide.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 70.</note>The number of the Men to be Personally engag'd, were Forty at least, of which Number Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi> was to make up about Twenty. Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi> was to furnish Eight, Capt. <hi>Porter</hi> Seven, Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi> Three Men and 5 Horses. To that end 2 or 3 Lists of Names were drawn up, out of which choice was made of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60129:20"/>
Two which were call'd Ordely Men, and Quarter'd at <hi>Kensington,</hi> to give Notice to the Rest when His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty went a Hunting.</p>
            <p>The Arms to be used were Blunderbusses, Musquets, Pistols, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The several Parties were to be dispers'd at the Inns at <hi>Brentford</hi> and <hi>Turnham-Green,</hi> that they might be in a readiness against the approach of the Fatal Hour.</p>
            <p>On the day the Design was to be executed, the Attempt was agreed to be made in this Manner: Some one or two, were to be at the Ferry, to give Notice when His Majesty Landed, first to Sir <hi>George Barclay,</hi> then to the rest.</p>
            <p>Upon Warning given of the King's being near at hand, all were to be in a readiness, to Issue forth in a Moment, some on Horse-back, some on Foot.</p>
            <p>Immediately,<note place="margin">Pag. 71</note> upon the Coach's coming within the Lane, they were to shut the Gate, and the Conspirators were to divide into three Parties: Some before in the Habit of County-men were to throw down the Pales, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore sawn a-sunder for the same purpose, in the narrowest Passage, so to prevent all possibility of Escape: Then Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi> with his Party were to attack the Guards in the Rear, and <hi>Rookwood</hi> and <hi>Porter</hi> with another Party in two Wings were to attack both sides of the Guards. The other Party to Aim only at His Majesty's Coach, which
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60129:21"/>
Party consisted of 8 Persons, and was to be under the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular direction of Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi>; the Villian declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before-hand, Mr. <hi>Prendergast</hi> was to have a very good Blunderbuss, which carried 7 or 8 Bullets, to be of his Party, and to Shoot into it. <hi>King</hi> at the same time tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him, <hi>He hop'd he would not be afraid of breaking the Glass-Windows.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 72.</note>It is indeed a thing prodigious to tell, and were it not for the undeniable Proofs of it, very difficult to be believ'd, that not only One or Two such Furies should rise up in a whole Age, but that so great a Number of Men should, be found so void of all Humanity, as not only to imagine and contrive so Horrid a Fact, but to discourse of it in so many Meetings, so sportfully and merrily as they did, as if the Cruelest Tragedy, which Wicked Men or the Devil ever invented, had been only a Matter of Common Past-time and loose Raillery.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 73.</note>The execrable Deed being thus supposed by them to be feasible, without much Opposition, they then farther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered the several Ways of their escaping afterwards. Sometimes they thought if it were possible to take the King alive and carry him to <hi>France,</hi> whether they intended to bear him Company. But if not, another way was proposed by Sir <hi>George Barclay,</hi> after the Fatal Blow was given, to get privately into the City before the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:60129:21"/>
News of what was done could possibly get thither. It was concluded at the same time, That those Lords and Principal Men of their Party should be ready to Head the Faction upon the first arrival of the News that the late King <hi>Iames</hi> was Landed.</p>
            <p>Thus Saturday the 15<hi>th</hi> of <hi>February</hi> being come, the first day pitch'd upon for executing their Hellish Design;<note place="margin">Pag. 74.</note> whilst they were thus wholly intent on this Barbarous Work, and proceeded securely in its Contrivance without any the least doubt of a prosperous Success, having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd every thing in order to have perpetrated this Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainous Work; Behold! on a sudden God miraculously disappointed all their Hopes, by <hi>Chamber</hi>'s bringing word, about Noon, the King went not Abroad that day.</p>
            <p>Yet notwithstanding they being disappointed at this time, which made them look one on another in much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, yet they could not part 'till they had drank their accustomed Healths: And to add to their Villainny, Capt. <hi>Porter</hi> took an <hi>Orange</hi> in his Hand, and began a Health to the <hi>Squeezing the rotten</hi> Orange, which having gone round, they took leave of each other for that Time.</p>
            <p>Presently after,<note place="margin">Pag. 75.</note> at their next meeting, their Discourse first tended to doubting whether the Design had not been discover'd; but then 'twas immediately answer'd, <hi>If it had, they should not have been there, but taken up.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they resolv'd, notwithstanding the former Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60129:22"/>
to Excecute the Divilish Design the next Saturday following.</p>
            <p>The Result of this their Consultation they imparted to their inferior Agents who were to act under them and order'd all things to be ready against that time.</p>
            <p>The late King for preparing a Declaration to facilitate his Re-accession to the Crown order'd divers of his Agents in <hi>England</hi> to send him their Conceptions, out of which Collection a Compleat Remonstrance was gather'd. The main Drift of the whole was to amuse the People's Fancies for a Time with new Chymera's of Freedom from Taxes, and Advantages for Trade: Then to calumniate and asperse King <hi>William</hi> as a Tyrant and Oppressor,<note place="margin">Pag. 79.</note> and accuse all his Faithful Subjects, as Servile Instruments of Arbitrary Power, and Betrayers of their Country: Whilst he and his Party were to be magnified as the only As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertors, and Restorers of Liberties, and Properties; who it is notoriously known have ever acted the contrary. His and their Design in all this being the same that has been put in Practice by all Promoters of Popish and Slavish Principles, Sedition and Treason in all Ages; who have always thought they have done more than half their Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, if they can but once appropiate to themselves all the good and pleasing Words of things plausible and popular, and fasten on His present Majesty's Government the Names and Titles of things vulgarly odious, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:60129:22"/>But in their particular Heads of Discourse in which the Con<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rs chiefly delighted,<note place="margin">Pag. 81.</note> and were wont in their Meetings most amply to enlarge their Inventions, was concerning their resolutions of several kinds of Vengeance to be executed on those Eminent Persons of all Professions, whom they thought most capable and willing to oppose their Bloody Enterprize.</p>
            <p>Their Passions in that part indeed transported them beyond all bounds of common Prudence even to the highest degree of ridiculous Vanity, and extravagant Ostentation of their full assurance to succeed in the dire Attempt.</p>
            <p>Having first gloried in the Imagination of imbruing their Hands in Royal Blood, they scrupl'd not to profess they would continue the Assassination on all the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Officers of the Crown, and Ministers of Justice; and spightfully projected all Circumstances imaginable which they thought might aggravate the Terrour or Ignominy of their Punishment.</p>
            <p>The Lord Mayor, and the Sheriffs of that Year, were concluded fit to be Murder'd. All others were doom'd to the like Destiny, who might think they deserv'd well of the Faction by their Moderation: But they resolv'd that Neuters should be treated as ill as their most a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed Enemies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:60129:23"/>They made no Distinction of Opinions, the Soberest and Richest of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> together with the Presbyterians and orher Dissenters they hated and dispis'd in general,<note place="margin">Pag. 82.</note> as Men whose Interest could not be divided from King <hi>William,</hi> as knowing they must fall with him, and undergo the same Fate.</p>
            <p>In this furious manner they proceeded to lay about 'em in their common Discourses, with all the Infernal Malice that is so agreeable to their Principles and inseperable from them: There never having yet been found, in all Records of Time, any Popish Plot but it was always most certainly attended with a fierce Spirit of Implacable Cruelty.</p>
            <p>As it cannot be imagin'd that either of the Cabals was altogether unacquainted with what the other were doing, during all this time; so it is manifest, some of their great Men understood the dark Hints that were sometimes given them, of <hi>taking off the Spark, removing the Yoke that lay so heavy upon them; and knocking him on the Head:</hi> And also that the inferiour Instruments pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded on assurance, That when they came to Action they should be Headed by Men of much higher Quality and Condition than as yet openly appear'd amongst them.</p>
            <p>Wherefore of the Debate and Resolutions of the <hi>French King</hi> and the late King <hi>Iames</hi>; in <hi>France</hi> it was thought
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60129:23"/>
expedient for the farthering of their Design, that a small select Number of the most eminent Heads of the Party, in and about <hi>London,</hi> should be united into a close Cabal, or secret Council; who might have their frequent As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies, and be ready on all Occasions, to guide and direct the motions of the lower Agents.</p>
            <p>The Persons who undertook this Universal Care and Inspection, were the Duke of <hi>Berwick,</hi> sent from <hi>France</hi> for that purpose, Sir <hi>William Parkyns,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Friend,</hi> Sir <hi>George Barclay,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Fenwick,</hi> Mr. <hi>Charnock,</hi> Mr. <hi>Porter</hi>; and some others, were admitted, as occasion serv'd, on some particular Debates.</p>
            <p>After their Arrival from <hi>France,</hi> they had several Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in <hi>Ianuary,</hi> particularly at the <hi>Globe-Tavern</hi> in <hi>Hatton-Garden,</hi> and at the <hi>Sun-Tavern</hi> in the <hi>Strand,</hi> where some General Heads were propounded of things to be resolv'd on,<note place="margin">Pag. 58.</note> in their more mature Thoughts, as where the Insurrection should first be made, in City, or Country, or both at once: what Countries were most disposed for Action: What Places would be most proper for their Rendezvouses: What Arms were necessary, how to be provided, where to be laid in, so as to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister no Ground of Jealousy: And how and by what means a Disturbance might be made in <hi>Scotland,</hi> at the same time.</p>

               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:60129:24"/>The last was look'd upon as a Principal Point, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the managment of that Affair was left to the <hi>French King,</hi> who had appointed a Considerable Body of Men to disturb the Peace and Tranquility of that Kingdom:<note place="margin">Pag. 86.</note> And who deliver'd this as his Opinion, <hi>That the Plot was so close and deeply laid, it was past the Power of Men and Devils to hinder the Fatal Blow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The late King <hi>Iames,</hi> that nothing should be wanting on his part, deputed some of his Confidents hither, to attend the Issue of their Debates, to represent their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posals; and to assist in the Assassination.</p>
            <p>The first Day appointed for the accomplishing this wicked Design was the 15<hi>th</hi> of <hi>February,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 87.</note> which being over, and they by the Singular Mercy of God disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed; yet so great was their Thirst after Royal Blood, that they did resolve to go on and execute it. And the next <hi>Saturday,</hi> which was the 22<hi>d</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> was pitch'd upon for the time of Execution; and accordingly, on <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> the 21<hi>st</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> the day before, they met at the Nags-Head in <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> where they had some discourse among them that they were in doubt, because of the first Disappointment, whether there had not been some Discovery, but that Doubt was soon over; for it was said <hi>it could not be so, for then they should not have been there together.</hi> That seemed probable, and the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:60129:24"/>
Disppointment was imputed to some Accident which gave them new Assurance to go on, and they resolv'd to go on and do the Business they had formerly resolv'd on, the next day, which was Saturday.</p>
            <p>Thus, on the 14<hi>th</hi> of <hi>February,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 88.</note> was the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy going on in a full Carreer, when Mr. <hi>Pren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergast</hi> made his Discovery: But finding that His Majesty and His Ministers, were exceeding diffident of his single Intelligence, in a business of so vast a Moment; therefore, whilst he was considering which way he might best strengthen his Evidence, Mr. <hi>De la Rue,</hi> on Friday Night, the 21<hi>st</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> was introduc'd to His Majesty by the Earl of <hi>Portland,</hi> who discover'd to him the Hellish Designs of his Implacable Enemies.</p>
            <p>Upon Saturday the 22<hi>d</hi> of <hi>February</hi> in the Morning, which was the 2<hi>d</hi> time appointed for the Execution of this Bloody Design,<note place="margin">Pag. 89.</note> they Met together at <hi>Porter</hi>'s Lodging, and resolved to go on with it and put it in Execution, where they had Notice from <hi>Chambers</hi> that the King did go a <hi>Hunting</hi> that Day, and there was great Joy among them all, thinking themselves sure; and so they ordered all things to be got ready. From thence they went to the Blew-posts in <hi>Spring-Garden,</hi> where. News was brought about one a Clock, <hi>That the King did not go Abroad, for the Guards were all come back in great haste,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60129:25"/>
their Horses being all in a Foam, and the King's Coaehes to the</hi> Mews-Gate.</p>
            <p>They at first receiv'd the News with various Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions and Motions of Mind,<note place="margin">Pag. 91.</note> looking on one another with much Astonishment and Confusion; and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately parted in great Disorder, being fully assur'd the thing had taken Air, and was discovered.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 92.</note>His Majesty, with inexpressible Surprize, found by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Evidence that many of his mis-guided Subjects had deeply engaged themselves to imbrue their Hands in His Royal Blood, went on Monday the 24<hi>th</hi> of <hi>February</hi> to the House of Lords, and in His Speech accquainted both Houses,
<q>
                  <p>That he was come on an extraordinary Occasion, which might have proved fatal if it had not been disappointed by the singular Mercy and Goodness of God.</p>
                  <p>That he had received several concurring Informations of a Design to assassinate him, and that our Enemies were very forward in their Preparations for a sudden Invasion of the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>That His Majesty had not been wanting to give the necessary Orders for the Fleet, and that he hoped there was a Strength of Ships, and in such a Readiness, as would be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to disappoint the Intentions of our Enemies.</p>
                  <p>That he had dispatched Orders for bringing Home such a Number of our Troops, a might secure us from any Attempt;
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60129:25"/>
and exhorted them to do every thing which they should judg proper for our Common Safety, &amp;c.</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this astonishing News the House of Commons (<hi>Nemine Contradicente</hi>) resolved to address His Majesty to
<q>congratulate his happy Deliverance, and to give him their Thanks for imparting the Horrid Design to the House, and to desire His Majesty to take more than ordinary Care of his Royal Person, assuring him that they will stand by, assist, and defend His Majesty with their Lives and Fortunes, against the late King <hi>Iames</hi> and all other His Enemies both at Home and Abroad; and that in case His Majesty should come to any violent Death (which God forbid) they would revenge the same upon all his Enemies an their Adherents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The House of Lords also unanimously agreed upon an Address to His Majesty, to which they desired the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of the Commons; who made some Amendments thereunto, to which the Lords agreeing: The same Evening both Houses attended His Majesty therewith.

                  <p>
                     <hi>My Lords and Gentlemen,  I Thank you heartily for this kind Address: On my Part you may be assured, that I will do all that is within my Power for the Conservation of this Kingdom, to which I have so many Obligations. I will readily adventure my Life for the Preservation of it, and recommend my self to the Continuance of your Loyalty and good Affections.</hi>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The House of Commons also the same Day resolved upon the following Association to be signed by their Members.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whereas there has been a Horrid and Detestable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy, Formed and Carried on by Papists, and other Wicked and Traiterous Persons, for Assassinating His Majesty's Royal Person in Order to Incourage an Invasion from</hi> France, <hi>to Subvert our Religion, Laws, and Liberty: We whose Names are hereunto Subscribed, do Heartily, Sincerely, and Solemnly Profess, Testify and Declare, That His Present Majesty King</hi> William <hi>is Rightful and Lawful King of these Realms. And we do Mutually Promise and Engage to stand by and assist each other, to the utmost of our
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60129:27"/>
Power, in the Support and Defence of His Majesty's most Sacred Person and Government, against the late King</hi> James <hi>and all his Adherents. And in case His Majesty come to any Violent or Vntimely Death (which God forbid) We do hereby further Freely and Vnanimously Oblige our Selves, to Vnite, Associate, and Stand by each other, in Revenging the same upon his Enemies, and their Adherents; and in Supporting and Defending the Succession of the Crown, according to an Act made in the First Year of the Reign of King</hi> William <hi>and Queen</hi> Mary, <hi>Intituled,</hi> An Act Declaring the Rights and Liberties of the Subject, and Settling the Succession of the Crown.</p>
            <p>There was also an Association agreed upon by the House of Lords, which was carried by a Majority, which appears to be of a <hi>Comfortable Importance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their Lordships Association differs so little from that of the Commons, that I do not transcribe it; but shew you how they vary: Instead of the Words [<hi>King</hi> William <hi>is RIGHTFVL and Lawful King</hi>] their Lordships insert.</p>
            <p>That <hi>His Present Majesty King</hi> William <hi>hath A RIGHT BY LAW to the Crown of this Realm, and that neither the late King</hi> James, <hi>nor the pretended Prince of</hi> Wales, <hi>nor any other Person hath any Right whatsoever to the same,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Ninety six of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, that was then present, subscribed their Association, and others
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60129:27"/>
who were at first absent, come in daily; it hath been refused only by 15.</p>
            <p>The House of Commons having, as I told you, agreed upon the above-written Association, ordered it to be engrossed, to be Signed by their Members; and near 400 of that August Assembly, which consists of 513, have already (with great Alacrity) subscribed it.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Tuesday</hi> the House ordered that their absent Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, as they come to the House, do come up to the Table, and sign the Association; or, in their Places, declare their Refusal so to do: and</p>
            <p>On <hi>Thursday</hi> it was ordered that the Association, and the Subscriptions thereunto, be entred upon the Journal of the House; and Resolved that it should be presented to His Majesty, by the Speaker, and <hi>the whole House,</hi> before the end of that Session.</p>
            <p>It was also, the same day, ordered that such Members who had not already, should by <hi>Monday</hi> Fortnight Sign the Association, or declare their Refusal.</p>
            <p>Now a day or two before the Conspirators final Sepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the King and his Council began to be convinc'd of the truth of <hi>Prendergast</hi> and <hi>Dela Rue</hi>'s Evidence, by a full knowledg of the Witnesses Characters, and by the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60129:28"/>
firmness and constancy of their Testimony, besides many other concurring Circumstances. Wherefore His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty ordered Warrants should be Issued out against the Persons accused, whereof some absconded, others were taken; of these last divers confirm'd what <hi>Prendergast</hi> and <hi>De la Rue</hi> had sworn, and Named others as Partakers in the Treason. Whereupon more and more appearing every day to have been engaged, Proclamations were Published in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> for their Speedy Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension. By this means through the Providence of God, so many of them were either Seized or Delivered themselves up, as have irrefragably confirmed every part of the foregoing Account. What became of the several Conspirators will appear by the Following List.</p>

               <p>The next was Mr. <hi>De la Rue,</hi> who Swore, That the said <hi>Edward King</hi> told him, on the 7<hi>th</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> that he was going out Town about something in order to the Design, with <hi>Knightly, Durance,</hi> and others, to see whether the King went to <hi>Richmond</hi> or <hi>Hounslow,</hi> and That sometime after he told this Deponent, he did ride out with his Friends, and that there was the Rarest Place for the Execution of the Design against King <hi>William</hi> that was possible, or had they studied never so long for a Convenient Place they could not have had such ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And that he was with him on the 15<hi>th</hi> and 22<hi>d</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> at <hi>Porter's</hi> Lodging, and the Blew-Posts in <hi>Spring-Garden,</hi> where they had Discourses concerning putting their Purpose in Execution. And that he had seen him at divers other Times and Places.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Bois</hi> swore, That <hi>King</hi> was the first that ever told him of the Assassination, it was at his own Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60129:31"/>
in this manner; That there was a great undertaking in hand, that he had put his Name into the List, and That, if he would make one, he should have a Horse; and gave him 20 <hi>s.</hi> to buy Boots. He told him several were come over from <hi>France</hi>; That the late King <hi>Iames</hi> would Land very Speedily.</p>

               <head>Against <hi>Keys.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>Capt. <hi>Porter</hi> first deposed, That he the said <hi>Keys</hi> was present at most of the Consultations, he hired Horses for the Captain to be imploy'd in the Business. That he was at the Blew-Posts in <hi>Spring-Garden,</hi> with him and the other Conspirators, where word was brought of the Disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, both the 15<hi>th</hi> and 22<hi>d</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> and That he agreed to be one that should be Personally concern'd in the Assassination.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Prendergast</hi> swore, That he the said <hi>Keys</hi> was at Capt. <hi>Porter</hi>'s Lodging in <hi>Maiden-lane,</hi> the 25<hi>th</hi> of <hi>February</hi> where were divers others, whose discourse chiefly tended to the Execution of the Assassination: and afterwards, on the same day, they met again at the Blew-Posts in the <hi>Spring-Garden,</hi> where, with others, he did agree to act in the Design.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>De la Rue</hi> deposed, That he the said <hi>Keys</hi> was one of those that met at the Blew-Posts in <hi>Spring-Garden,</hi> on Saturday the 22<hi>d</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> and he was the only Man
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60129:31"/>
told him of the Meetings. That when Word was brought of the Disappointment, he went to the <hi>Mews-Gate,</hi> to learn the reason if he could of the King's not going abroad for two Saturdays together; and that he brought in word. <hi>The Guards were come back in a Foam, and the King's Coach to the</hi> Mews-gate, <hi>and by People's Muttering he fear'd a Discovery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the whole Evidence against <hi>Charnock, King</hi> and <hi>Keys</hi> being clear and positive Testimony; and what they pleaded for themselves being only their own single Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and Negation, without any support of Witnesses, the Jury brought them in Guilty of High-Treason.</p>
               <p>Accordingly to which Sentence they were Executed the 18<hi>th</hi> of the said Month.</p>
               <p>At the time of their Execution each of them deliver'd a Paper, to the Sheriffs, wherein they own'd themselves guilty of the Crime for which they stood Condemn'd, and that they were for Killing the King and the Guards.</p>
               <p>The next Criminal Arraign'd was Sir <hi>Iohn Friend,</hi> who was brought to his Tryal, <hi>March</hi> the 23<hi>d</hi> of that Year.</p>
               <p>Against him Capt. <hi>Porter</hi> deposed, That about the latter end of <hi>May</hi> or beginning of <hi>Iune</hi> 1695, on a Monday, the Lord <hi>Aylesbury,</hi> the Lord <hi>Mongomery,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Friend,</hi> Sir <hi>William Parkyns,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Fenwick,</hi> Mr. <hi>Charnock,</hi> one <hi>Cook,</hi> and this Deponent, met at the old King's-Head in
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60129:32"/>
                  <hi>Leadenhall-Street,</hi> and at one Mrs. <hi>Monjoy</hi>'s-<hi>Tavern</hi> in St. <hi>Iames</hi>'s-<hi>street,</hi> sometime after. At both these Meetings it was consulted and agreed, to send <hi>Charnock</hi> over to <hi>France</hi> to invite the late King <hi>Iames</hi> to <hi>England</hi> and to prevail with the <hi>French King</hi> to furnish him with 10000 Men; 8000 Foot, 1000 Horse, and 1000 Dragoons, and each did promise to meet him at his Landing with 2000 Horse, and Sir <hi>Iohn Friend</hi> did say, <hi>he would be as forward in his Assistance as any.</hi> And not long after the second they had a third Meeting, where were Sir <hi>William Parkyns,</hi> Sir <hi>George Barclay,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Friend,</hi> one <hi>Holmes,</hi> Mr. <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guson,</hi> and this Deponent.</p>
               <p>Capt. <hi>Blair</hi> swore, that 2 or 3 Years ago Sir <hi>Iohn Friend</hi> produc'd a Commission he had from K. <hi>Iames,</hi> to be a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel of a Regiment of Horse, which he was to raise, and to appoint what Officers he thought fit; That he read the Commission, it was seal'd at the Top <hi>Iames Rex,</hi> and counter-sign'd <hi>Melford,</hi> That he promised this Deponent he should be his Lieutenant Colonel, and told him he should get as many Men as he could, that Mr. <hi>Fisher</hi> was to be his first Captain, and <hi>Vernatti</hi> was to be another, and Mr. <hi>Sclater</hi> should be Captain of a Troop of Non-Swearing Parsons, and that for ingaging and contracting with Men to come in to be of his Regiment, and to caress and keep them together and to carry on the Design, he had expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a great deal of Money. And that he laid down 100 <hi>l.</hi>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:60129:32"/>
to facilitate Col. <hi>Parker</hi>'s escape out of the <hi>Tower</hi>; That he had wrote a Letter to King <hi>Iames,</hi> and gave it this Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to read, who told him 'twas well penn'd, and that he believed Mr. <hi>Ferguson</hi> did pen it.</p>
               <p>To this Sir <hi>Iohn Friend</hi> makes an Objection against the Credit of the Witnesses that they were not to be believed, upon this Account, because they are known to be Roman Catholicks, and he a Protestant, their Consciences as to Oaths, are somewhat large, especially when they swear against Protestants, and therefore, says he, they are not to be allow'd, against Protestants, as Witnesses; and that their Credit was not sufficient to induce a Jury to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them. At first he alledged there was a Statute that disabled them from being Witnesses, but that was proved to him to the Contrary.</p>
               <p>Then he insisted upon it, that <hi>Blair</hi> was not to be look'd upon as a Witness, and that because he denyed he knew any thing of the Plot: The Occasion of that was this; when he was in the <hi>Gate-House,</hi> there was News in the <hi>Flying-Post</hi> or <hi>Post-Boy,</hi> where it was alledged that <hi>Blair</hi> had confess'd all; and that thereupon <hi>Blair</hi> said, <hi>he was Innocent</hi>; but <hi>Blair</hi> being called into Court again swears, <hi>he did not say he knew nothing of a Plot,</hi> but deny'd being privy to, or concern'd in the Assassination: so that he did not deny wholly to be in the Plot, but in the Assassina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:60129:33"/>Another thing he insisted upon to be a Matter of Law, in the Statute of the 25. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. which was over-rul'd by the Court.</p>
               <p>So that what he had to say for himself, proving no way material; then the Jury withdrew, and return'd after a short time, and brought him in Guilty of High-Treason.</p>
               <p>As touching the Paper he deliver'd to the Sheriffs, at the time of his Execution, he said, <hi>he died in Charity with all Men, and a Member of the Church of</hi> England; he no way denyed the Fact for which he stood Condemn'd, but rather Justified it, and made some groundless Reflections on the legal and regular Proceedings against him; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding with a Prayer which could be dictated by none but a fierce Jacobite. It was in truth a Prayer more proper for their Treasonable Meetings at the Old King's-Head in <hi>Leadenhall-streei, &amp;c.</hi> than to be used as the last Words of a Gentleman dying in the Profession of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next Offender that came under the stroke of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, was Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi>; who came to his Tryal the 24<hi>th</hi> of <hi>March</hi> the same Year: Amongst the several Witnesses that was produc'd Capt. <hi>Porter</hi> was the first, who has been a Witness hitherto against several upon the like Occasion, he swore, That about the latter end of <hi>May</hi> or beginning of <hi>Iune,</hi> 1695, Sir <hi>Iohn Fenwick,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Friend,</hi> Sir <hi>William Parkyns,</hi> and this Deponent, with
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60129:33"/>
divers others, Met at the Old Kings-Head in <hi>Leadenhall-street,</hi> and some time after, at Mrs. <hi>Monjoy</hi>'s; at both which Places they did consult, how they might again Restore King <hi>Iames:</hi> in order to it they thought it very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to send, Mr. <hi>Charnock,</hi> who was at that Meeting, to King <hi>Iames,</hi> and invite him to <hi>England</hi> with a French Force, <hi>viz.</hi> 8000 Foot, 1000 Horse, and 1000 Dragoons, if he could solicit the French <hi>King</hi> to lend him so many, and that each of them did send their promise to meet him, where he should appoint to Land, at the Head of 2000 Horse.</p>
               <p>And further, as to the Assassination, he swore, That a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the latter end of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> or beginning of <hi>February,</hi> Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi> was sent over with a Commission from the late King <hi>Iames</hi>; whereupon Sir <hi>George Barclay,</hi> Sir <hi>William Parkyns,</hi> this Deponent, with divers others, had several Meetings, particularly at the <hi>Globe-Tavern</hi> in <hi>Hatton-Garden,</hi> the Nags-Head Tavern in <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> the <hi>Sun-Tavern</hi> in the <hi>Strand,</hi> and other places. Where it was resolved to undertake to Assassinate King <hi>William,</hi> that Sir <hi>William</hi> did consent to it, and said, <hi>he thought it necessary to be done, to facilitate the Restauration of King</hi> James: and offer'd to Lend 5 Horses to engage in it, three to be mounted by Men as he would get, the other two by Capt. <hi>Porter</hi>; That he told <hi>Charnock,</hi> in this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents hearing, <hi>He had a Commission from King</hi> James
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:60129:34"/>
                  <hi>for the raising a Troop of Horse, and that he had seen and read the Commission Sir</hi> George Barclay <hi>brought over, which was to Levy War against the Person of the Prince of</hi> Orange, <hi>and that he would not Personally engage in the Assassination, because he had a Regiment to look after.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sweet</hi> swore, That he the said Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi> told him about <hi>Christmas</hi> last, <hi>That King</hi> James <hi>would come</hi>; he ask'd him, <hi>How he knew it?</hi> He told him, <hi>He had his Word for it; and that he had a Troop which consisted of Old Soldiers; he had Thirty Sadles, and besides there would be some Volunteers which were old Officers: That he was to go into</hi> Leicester-Shire, <hi>and did,</hi> it was about the latter end of <hi>Ianuary, and</hi> Scudamore <hi>went with him; and one</hi> Yar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough, <hi>and a Parson that came out of</hi> York shire, <hi>met him there: And that he found the</hi> West <hi>was as well inclin'd to</hi> King James<hi>'s Interest as the</hi> North; <hi>and a Lord's Brother was concern'd.</hi> That Sir <hi>William</hi> sent for him out of the Country the second time the King was to be Assassinated, and that he had designed to have used him in the business, but that he had Compassion on his Family.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eubank</hi> swore, That he, in <hi>Ianuary</hi> last, waited on Sir <hi>VVilliam</hi> into <hi>Leicester-shire</hi> where several resorted to him, particularly one <hi>Yarborongh,</hi> and a <hi>York shire</hi> Parson; that afterwards he ordered him to bring three Horses to <hi>London,</hi> and he brought them up the 14<hi>th</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> and Sir <hi>VVilliam</hi> told him, <hi>he thought to go out of Town
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:60129:34"/>
on the Morrow,</hi> being Saturday; but his mind altered 'till Monday following, when he went to his House in <hi>VVarwick-shire,</hi> and return'd the Friday after, which was the 21<hi>st</hi> of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> and brought up four Horses more. The next Day, being Saturday, this Deponent was sent on a Message to <hi>Kensington</hi>; the Answer he brought back was writ in his Almanack, which he shewed to Sir <hi>William,</hi> who thereupon bid him <hi>go to his Inn, and get his Horses ready to go out of Town in the Afternoon,</hi> which he did; on the Monday following he received a Letter from Sir <hi>William,</hi> to go to his Fellow-Servant <hi>Evans</hi>; that after reading the Letter, they went with a Cart and Horses to one <hi>Haywood</hi>'s House to fetch some Chests; there were three large Ones, out of which were taken seven or eight smaller, which they carried to Sir <hi>William</hi>'s House, and buried them in the Garden.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Thomas Watts</hi> was sworn, who deposed, That after the breaking out of the Plot, he did search Sir <hi>William Parkyns</hi>'s House, where, in the Garden, he found buried several Boxes, or Chests; there was in them four Dozen of Swords, Thirty two Carbines, Twenty five Brace of Pistols.</p>
               <p>There are more Substantial Concurring Evidence, which I think two tedious to mention; but shall refer any inquisitive Person to the Tryals.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:60129:35"/>Sir <hi>VVilliam Parkyns</hi> says for himself, that he does ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit and agree, what <hi>Porter</hi> says is very positive and full, but that is but the Evidence of one Witness: And that by the Law no Person ought to be convicted of High-Treason upon the Testimony of one Witness. But then it was answer'd, as to the Matter of Law, he is to the right, <hi>no Man ought to be convicted of Treason, upon the Testimony of one single VVitness</hi>: But it was prov'd he, with others, did send <hi>Charnock</hi> into <hi>France.</hi> To which if you add the Testimony of <hi>Sweet,</hi> who swore Sir <hi>VVilliam</hi> told him <hi>King</hi> James <hi>would come, that he had a Troop, had bought Saddles, his having such a quantity of Arms, of his going into</hi> Liecester-shire. If all which be understood in pursuance of the Design against His present Majesty, then there are at least Two Witnesses, to several Overt-Acts of the same Treason.</p>
               <p>But then it was objected by Sir <hi>VVilliam,</hi> That <hi>Sweet</hi> does not prove any Overt-Act, <hi>that what he said being only words, and words are not Treason.</hi> But then it was answer'd, <hi>they are words that relate to Acts and Things.</hi> That he had a great quantity of Arms, beyond what he, as a private Man, could have occasion for, or use: Sir <hi>VVilliam</hi> pretended <hi>he found them at his House, when he first went thither, all rusty</hi>; but account was given, these were bright and fit for use.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:60129:35"/>By this plain evidence of the several Stages of his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, his Treasonable Intercourse with the Men of the <hi>North,</hi> his agreeing, with others, to send <hi>Charnock</hi> to <hi>France,</hi> his providing such a considerable quantity of Arms, his engaging to lend 5 Horses, and 3 Men, to act in the Assas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sination, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was made out beyond all possibility of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation. After a full hearing on both sides the Jury with-drew, and after a very short time return'd, and brought him guilty of High-Treason: According to which Sentence he was Executed the 3<hi>d</hi> of <hi>April</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. At the time of his Death delivered a written Paper to the Sheriffs, wherein he acknowledg'd his being concern'd in the Design against the King's Life.</p>
               <p>On the 21<hi>st</hi> of <hi>April</hi> 1696, was <hi>Ambrose Rookwood</hi> brought to Tryal. Against him Capt. <hi>Porter</hi> first deposed, that at several Meetings for the carring on this Design against His Majesty, Mr. <hi>Rookwood</hi> was present, more particularly at the <hi>Globe-Tavern</hi> in <hi>Hatton-Garden,</hi> where Sir <hi>George Barclay,</hi> Mr. <hi>Charnock,</hi> Sir <hi>VVilliam Parkyns,</hi> this Deponent, and others, discours'd which was the best way and method; That, and first, Mr. <hi>Rookwood</hi> said, <hi>'twas a very desperate thing, and seem'd not very willing to</hi> engage in it, whereupon Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi> told him, <hi>he should command his Party</hi>; he reply'd in <hi>French, There's an end of it,</hi> and consented.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:60129:36"/>And farther that on Saturday Morning the 15<hi>th</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> there met at his, this Deponent's Lodging, in Little <hi>Rider-street,</hi> Sir <hi>George Barclay, Rookwood,</hi> and several others, where word was brought by <hi>Durance,</hi> the King did go abroad; and it was resolv'd by all, the same Day to put their Design in Execution.</p>
               <p>The next Witness produced was Captain <hi>Harris,</hi> who swore, That on <hi>Saturday</hi> Morning the 15<hi>th</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> the first Day when this Assassination was design'd to be committed, he went to the Lodging of one <hi>Burk,</hi> where Mr. <hi>Rookwood</hi> was, with others, and he found them all in great Disorder, and thereupon ask'd them, <hi>what was the matter, and what they were going to do?</hi> And <hi>Rookwood</hi> bid him go to one <hi>Counter, and he should know of him what was the matter.</hi> Accordingly he went; and <hi>Counter</hi> told him, and those who were with him, That they must get ready to go to <hi>Turnham-Green</hi>; and at the same Time and Place, he this Deponent met Sir <hi>G. Barclay,</hi> and after some Discourse of attacking the Coach, Sir <hi>G. Barclay</hi> at the first said, <hi>They were his Ianizaries</hi>; and afterwards going out, he came in again, and said, <hi>They were Men of Honour, and that they were to go abroad to attack the Prince of</hi> Orange:</p>
               <p>He further depos'd, That upon <hi>Saturday</hi> the 22<hi>d</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> the second time it was to have been put in Execution, Mr. <hi>Rookwood</hi> gave this Deponent a List of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:60129:36"/>
Men that he was to Command; that Mr. <hi>Rookwood</hi>'s Name was at the Top, and this Deponent's counterfeit Name, which was <hi>Ienkins,</hi> and <hi>Hare</hi>'s counterfeit Name, which was <hi>Guinea</hi>; and that he told this Deponent, <hi>He was to be of his Party, and that he should be his Aid-du-Camp, and they were to make ready to go to</hi> Turnham Green <hi>to attack the Prince of</hi> Orange.</p>
               <p>Then the Council for the Prisoner endeavour'd to take off the Credit of Mr. <hi>Porter,</hi> and opened very great Crimes, that he should be guilty of, which must render him a Person not to be believed; but did not prove any thing: No Witness that they call'd against Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> said any thing against him, to invalidate his Testimony, or to introduce any one to disbelieve what he has said.</p>
               <p>Then they said in Point of Law, there is no Overt-Act proved of any Design against the King's Life, that affects Mr. <hi>Rookwood</hi>; there were other Objections started, which were over-rul'd by the Court. The Jury went forth to consider of their Verdict, and after a quarter of an Hours stay return'd, and brought him in Guilty of High-Treason.</p>
               <p>The next Person that was call'd to the Bar to justify himself, was <hi>Charles Cranburne,</hi> the 22<hi>d</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> 1696. Against him Capt. <hi>Porter</hi> deposed, That he made the said <hi>Cranburne</hi> acquainted with the Design of Assassina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting His Majesty King <hi>VVilliam,</hi> the Day before they were
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:60129:37"/>
to execute it; and he engaged to be ready and make one. On Saturday, the 22<hi>d</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> he came to my Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Maiden-lane,</hi> and I sent him to Sir <hi>William Parkyns.</hi> for a Note for two Horses that I was to mount of his: He came back and told me <hi>he knew where to have them, and that Capt.</hi> Charnock <hi>was afraid we should not have our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement of Men, and desir'd me to send him an account what Men I could bring,</hi> which I did, by Mr. <hi>Cranburne</hi>; and being to go to the Blew-Posts, order'd him to bring it to me thither; and he did bring it back to me, to the Blew-Posts, with Capt. <hi>Charnock</hi>'s List underneath: And not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding word being brought of the Disappoiotment, we parted not till we had drank the Healths, <hi>to the Resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the late King</hi> James, <hi>the Prince of</hi> Wales, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>De la Rue</hi> swore, That he the said <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne,</hi> the 22<hi>d</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> the day on which they the second time thought to put the Design in Execution, was sent with a List, by Capt. <hi>Porter,</hi> of his Men, and whilst I and Capt. <hi>Porter</hi> was at the Blew-Posts in <hi>Spring-Garden,</hi> he brought, to Capt. <hi>Porter,</hi> the List from <hi>Charnock,</hi> with an addition of Names. And after, word was brought of the Disappointment, the Company began to drink very Disloyal Healths, as <hi>to the Restoring the late King</hi> James, <hi>the Queen, the Prince of</hi> Wales, <hi>and the</hi> French King. Then Capt. <hi>Porter,</hi> having an Orange in his Hand, squeez'd it, and drank a Health, <hi>to the squeezing the rotten
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:60129:37"/>
Orange</hi>; which was Pledg'd by all, and particularly by Mr. <hi>Cranburne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Prendergast</hi> depos'd, That he was with Mr. <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne</hi> the 14<hi>th</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> and there was a Discourse of going in pursuance of this Design the next day, and Mr. <hi>Cranburne</hi> agreed to it: and when they were disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the 15<hi>th</hi> being at the <hi>Blue-Posts</hi> in <hi>Spring-Garden,</hi> they then agreed to pursue it the next <hi>Saturday,</hi> and that <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne</hi> was one of them that agreed to it.</p>
               <p>To all this Mr. <hi>Cranburne</hi> and his Council offer'd very little, finding the Evidence so positive; so the Jury with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew to consider of their Verdict a quarter of an Hour, and return'd into Court, having found him guilty of High-Treason.</p>
               <p>On <hi>VVednesday</hi> the 22<hi>d</hi> of <hi>April</hi> 1696, <hi>Robert Lowick</hi> was brought to the <hi>King's-Bench</hi> Bar, for Conspiring to Assassinate his Majesty King <hi>VVilliam.</hi> Against him Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> swore, That between the 15<hi>th</hi> and 22<hi>th</hi> of <hi>February</hi> he met Mr. <hi>Lowick</hi> in <hi>Red-Lion-fields,</hi> and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed with him there, about the Assassination; and told him what a barbarous and inhumane thing it was that we should be the Murderers of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and that it would render us odious to all the World, and that we should be a continual Reproach to our selves; he did agree it was so, but would obey Orders; that he said Sir <hi>George Barclay,</hi> he was sure, would not do it without Orders; which he repeated twice.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:60129:38"/>On <hi>Saturday</hi> the 22<hi>th</hi> he this Deponent and Mr. <hi>Lowick</hi> din'd at a Cooks at the End of <hi>Red-Lion-street</hi>; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there together, he this Deponent was in a Sweat, and <hi>Lowick</hi> ask'd him the Reason; he told him he had been about to get ready <hi>Rookwood</hi>'s Party that were to seize the King: says he, you need not grudg to do it, you have six Shillings a day, and I have nothing, and yet I brought a couple of Men at my own Charge.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Bertram</hi> swore, That he the said <hi>Robert Lowick</hi> came to him about the Beginning of <hi>February</hi> last, and ask'd him if he would espouse a thing with him that might be for his Advantage? He told him, he thought he might espouse any thing that he thought fit to engage in; he answer'd it was well, and desir'd him to ask him no more Questions. On the 14<hi>th</hi> of <hi>February</hi> he desired him to be at his Lodging at 12 a Clock; he went: when he came there, he took him up into his Chamber, and told him, he believed they would ride out in some little time, and that the King was to be seiz'd in his Coach; and he gave him a Guinea to buy him Necessaries.</p>
               <p>To this he and his Council had little to offer in their Defence, the Evidence being so full and positive against them; which being summ'd up to the Jury, they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew for a short time, and return'd into Court, having found him guilty of High-Treason: according to which Sentence he was Executed, and <hi>Rookwood</hi> and <hi>Cranburne</hi> with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:60129:38"/>On <hi>VVednesday</hi> the 13<hi>th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> in the said Year 1696, <hi>Peter Cook</hi> Gent. was Indicted for endeavouring to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Forces from <hi>France</hi> to invade this Kingdom, and Conspiring to levy War in this Realm for assisting and abetting the said Invasion, in order to the Deposing his Sacred Majesty King <hi>William,</hi> and Restoring the late King <hi>Iames.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first Witness produced was Mr. <hi>Porter,</hi> who swore, That the Lord <hi>Ailesbury,</hi> my Lord <hi>Montgomery,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Fenwick,</hi> Sir <hi>VVilliam Parkins,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Friend,</hi> Mr. <hi>Charnock,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cook,</hi> and himself, (Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi> came in after Dinner) had two Meetings; the first was in <hi>May,</hi> at the old <hi>King's Head</hi> Tavern in <hi>Leadenhall-Street,</hi> in order to consult about an Invasion. In this Meeting it was consulted which was the best Way, and the quickest, to restore King <hi>Iames,</hi> and hasten his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into <hi>England</hi>; several Discourses and Proposals there were: At last in was agreed to send Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi> to the late King, to borrow of the French King 10000 Men, 8000 Foot, 1000 Horse, and 1000 Dragoons, to be sent over into <hi>England,</hi> to assist the late King's Restoration. Says Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi> thereupon, <hi>This the King can do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out your sending, and I would not go upon a Foolish Errand. What will you do in this Matter?</hi> The Company desir'd him to promise King <hi>Iames, That if he would send word where he landed, they would be sure to meet him at his Landing with a Body of</hi> 2000 <hi>Horse.</hi> And all of them that were there present, was ask'd by <hi>Charnock, Whether he might assure the King of what they had told him?</hi> Every one said, <hi>Yes, you may:</hi> And when Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> was ask'd, he kneel'd upon a Chair, and said, <hi>Yes, you may.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 2d Meeting was about the latter end of <hi>May,</hi> or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>Iune,</hi> at Mrs. <hi>Montjoy</hi>'s Tavern, at St. <hi>Iames</hi>'s;
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:60129:39"/>
where were present, at that time, my Lord <hi>Aylesbury,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Friend,</hi> Sir <hi>William Parkyns,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Charnock,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cook,</hi> and himself; they did assure Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi> that they kept to their former Resolution, and would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide to what was agreed upon at their first Meeting: And that accordingly Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi> did go to <hi>France,</hi> and he did return, and bring back King <hi>Iames</hi>'s Thanks to them: and he had share of the Complement.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Goodman</hi> swore, That about the middle of the Month of <hi>May,</hi> Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> acquainted him there would be a Meeting of some of King <hi>Iames</hi>'s Friends, at the Old King's-head in <hi>Leadenhall-street</hi>; that tho he could not dine with them he would come to them after Dinner, which he did; when he came there, Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> brought him into a Room where was my Lord <hi>Montgomery,</hi> my Lord <hi>Aylesbury,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Fenwick,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Friend,</hi> Sir <hi>William Parkins,</hi> Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cook:</hi> after we were set down, there was a Consultation, that consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the French King's Wars retarded the Affair of sending back King <hi>Iames,</hi> and the means of restoring him to the Crown; it was thought fit after some Debate to send Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> to King <hi>Iames,</hi> to prevail with the French King to furnish Ten Thousand Men, whereof 8000 to be Foot, 1000 Horse, and 1000 Dragoons: That we would meet him at the Head of 2000 Horse. When our Resolution of the Thing and the Number was thus fixed, Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi> ask'd, <hi>whether it were with all our Consents? And that he might assure the King, that this was our Resolution?</hi> Whereupon we all rose up, and said to him, <hi>Yes, you may; Yes, you may</hi>; every one particularly: that at the same time Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> kneel'd upon the Chair, when he said, <hi>Yes, you may,</hi> and his Elbows were upon the Table.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:60129:39"/>There was another Meeting as Capt. <hi>Porter</hi> told me, but I had Business in the City; but whatever he promis'd on my behalf as to the Quota of Men, I would be sure to make it good, but was not at the second Meeting.</p>
               <p>So that after a Long Tryal and hearing Council both for the King and Prisoner, the Jury with-drew to consider of their Verdict about three quarters of an Hour; they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd into Court, and brought him in Guilty of High-Treason.</p>
               <p>As for the Persons Out-law'd, my Lord, they having by Law the space of a whole Year allow'd to surrender themselves,<note place="margin">Pag. 1<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>0</note> before they are to be look'd on as Men abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to be condemn'd, it's hoped before that Time's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, that some of them will voluntarily come in, and stand a legal Trial, and, if possible, prove themselves innocent: but if not, they must not think the Evidence against them will be any longer suppress'd, there being to be found in the Informations given in upon Oath, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly sufficient to convict every Man of them, either of the intended Insurrection or Assassination; both which are made out with as much Clearness of Testimony and Strength as any Humane Affair is capable of.</p>
               <p>And his Majesty is deeply sensible, and hath pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly acknowledg'd,<note place="margin">Pag. 171</note> how he has once more been preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, by the immediate Hand of Heaven, from the Rage and Violence of blood-thirsty and cruel Men; cannot but look on himself as a-fresh oblig'd to manifest his Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to Heaven, by promoting the Glory of his Preserver, in continuing to consult, above all things, the Welfare of his Church, and the Peace and Happiness of this great People committed to his Charge.</p>
               <p>And since, my Lord, the Divine Favour has so mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellously put into his Hands this new Advantage, he will
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:60129:40"/>
improve it, not in Acts of Severity and Revenge, which your Lordship knows his Nature utterly abhors, but by imitating the Divine Goodness, in a regular Course of strict Justice to all obdurate Impenitents; so, which he much rather desires, in his usual Method of Mercy and Kindness, to as many as shall give sincere Proofs of Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and Reformation of their pail Crimes: Vertues, which we have too much Reason to believe, his Enemies have been hitherto little acq<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ainted with.</p>
               <p>Before I conclude, my good Lord, let me entreat your Lordship's Patience whilst I address my self to those mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided <hi>English</hi>-men, who, after all this, persevere to be disaffected to his Majesty and the Government; whom I would willingly perswade to cease doting on their old Bondage, and hankering after a Perjur'd Prince, who when amongst us, broke his Coronation Oath, and stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died nothing more than subjecting us to Popery, Slavery, a Despotick and Arbitrary Government. Did he not assume to himself a Power to suspend and dispence with the Execution of the Laws, enacted for the Security and Happiness of the Subjects, and thereby rendred them of none effect? And did he not, in order to the obtaining a Judgment in the Court of <hi>King's-Bench,</hi> for declaring the Dispensing Power a Right belonging to the Crown, turn out such Judges as could not in Conscience concur in so pernicious a Sentence? And after having pack'd Judges for his Purpose, he obtain'd the Judgment he requir'd. What, Can no King please them but him who set up a Commission of Ecclesiastical Matters, against express Laws to the contrary, which were executed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all Law? Can no one content them but a Prince who values nothing in the World so much as the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning our Religion? and in order thereto, Did he not
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:60129:40"/>
send the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and six other Bishops, to the <hi>Tower,</hi> for setting forth, in a Petition, their Reasons why they could not obey the Order requiring them to appoint their Clergy to read the Declaration for Liberty of Conscience? Finally, Can nothing please them but a King who Arbit<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ally, and against Law, turn'd the Fellows of <hi>Magdalen</hi> College in <hi>Oxford</hi> out of their Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds, and put the College into the hands of Papists? Did he not bring his Army of <hi>Irish</hi> Cut-throats by whom we went in danger  of being Murder'd every Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
               <p>Or if the Experience of Time past,<note place="margin">Pag. 173</note> so dearly bought, can prevail nothing with them, let them but seriously reflect on their present Condition, Who may, if they will, Securely enjoy Peace, Plenty, Liberty, and the best Religion under the best of Princes, whilst many Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided Gentlemen, both <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Scotch,</hi> who have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon'd their Families and Estates to follow that Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Prince to St. <hi>Germain's</hi> where a considerable Party being Protestants,<note place="margin">Vide <hi>A View of the Court of</hi> St. Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains.</note> they only desir'd a Chappel from the late King <hi>Iames,</hi> for the Exercise of their Worship according to the Church of <hi>England</hi>; and propos'd Dr. <hi>Granvile,</hi> Brother to the Earl of <hi>Bath,</hi> formerly <hi>Dean</hi> of <hi>Durham,</hi> as a fit Person to be their Chaplain: They urged the great Incouragment such a Toleration would give to his Adherents in <hi>England,</hi> and what Satisfaction it would be, to such Protestants as followed him; but tho' common Policy, and his Circumstances made every body believe that this request would be easily granted, yet it was positively denyed, and Dr. <hi>Granvile</hi> obliged not onely to retire from Court, but also from the Town of St. <hi>Germains</hi> to avoid the daily Insults of the Priests, and the dreaded Consequences of the Jealousies with which
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:60129:41"/>
they possess'd King <hi>Iames</hi>'s Court against him. Dr. <hi>Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> a Bishop of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the only Protestant Divine that then was there, met with a worse Treatment still than Dr. <hi>Granvile,</hi> and was reduc'd to the necessity of abjuring his Religion for want of Bread, with which he could not be supplyed but upon those hard Terms.</p>
               <p>Let them examine a little farther, and they will find the Lord Chief Justice <hi>Herbert,</hi> a Person both well quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to give Advice in <hi>English</hi> Affairs, and of an unspotted Reputation in his Country, interceding in behalf of the Protestant Party's Demand: Upon which an Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation was trump'd up against the Chief Justice by Mr. <hi>Comptroller Skelton</hi> and Sir <hi>William Sharp,</hi> of having said that K. <hi>Iames</hi>'s Violent Temper would ruin himself and all that Follow'd him. My Lord own'd the Words; but made so ingenious an Explanation of his meaning, that King <hi>Iames</hi> was satisfied. Shortly after they charged him with another Plot of corresponding with the <hi>English,</hi> whereupon he, and a Worthy Lady with whom he Boarded, were confined; and <hi>Broomfield,</hi> the Quaker, committed to the <hi>Bastile.</hi> Thus was my Lord Chief Justice, for no other reason but his adhering to a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testent Interest, excluded from all share of Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Affairs in King <hi>Iames</hi>'s Court; tho' his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity and Sufferings were sufficient, in the Eyes of all reasonable Men, to have intituled him to a share in that Prince's Favour and Secrets. If my Lord Chief Justice <hi>Herbert</hi> was so used, I would fain know, upon what Ground any of our <hi>Iacobites</hi> should flatter themselves of a better Treatment.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Andrew Forrester,</hi> Sir <hi>Theophilus Oglethorp,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Fergus Graham,</hi> these Gentlemen by their Capacities as well as Services, were encourag'd to go over and offer
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:60129:41"/>
their Assistance to King <hi>Iames</hi>; at whose hands they were unkindly used, and the Reward of their Service, only a Pass to return for <hi>England</hi> again; where 'tis expected they will Plot no more.</p>
               <p>If there can still remain any well-meaning Men in their Party, led away by the specious Delusions of good Words abused to the worst of things, let them instead of hearkening to what Wicked and designing Men under the most deceitful Colours Suggest to them for Sinister Ends, guide their Opinions by their own plain and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Observations. Let them but fairly and indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, compare the present State of all Nations round about them with their own: And then let them, if they can, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to Bless God and King <hi>William</hi> for their inexpressible Advantages above all others.</p>
               <p>Henceforth therefore let no vain pretence of Liberty and Property push them on to the same desperate Designs by fomenting Jeasousies between the King and his People, or throwing in Sparks of Discontent, and endeavouring to blow them up into Flames of Mutinies and Rebellions. Be advised to consider what you are doing, and run not headlong to Destruction by helping forward your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries Ruine, by labouring to Subject it to its most avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Enemies; the securing whose Interest here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> was the Devilish Design so long on Foot.</p>
               <p>Wherefore let me conjure them to look back on their past Actions which gave us the dismal Prospect of Slavery in our Persons, Consciences and Estates, if the Divine Goodness had not miraculously appear'd for our Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance.</p>
               <p>Let us seriously consider, if the Direful Stroak which was Levell'd against His Majesty had taken effect, what the Consequence would have been; assuredly we must
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:60129:42"/>
have bid adieu to our Religion, Law and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
