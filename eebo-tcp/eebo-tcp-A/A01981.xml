            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Hereby is declared, that the violence of his affliction was ſuch, as like a boiſterous ſtorme it was enough in his beſt ſtrength to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw him: and it alſo ſo waſted his ſtrength and weakned him, as he could not ſtand, but was ready againe and againe to fall: it foiled him exceedingly. By removing that affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction God delivered his <hi>feet from falling.</hi> But this is ſpoken in an Allegory. For, by his <hi>feet</hi> are meant his ſpirit, by <hi>fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> the fainting thereof. So as his very ſoule was preſerved from being overwhelmed.</p>

                     <hi>proteſtation</hi> for his outward converſation is here generally propounded.</p>
                  <p>This phraſe <hi>I will walke,</hi> is taken diverſly. Some take it for an expreſſion of his confidence in the continuance of Gods favour towards him: that God who had freed him out of the jaws of death, would now continue him in the land of the living, there to remaine, and abide before the Lord. Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Engliſh Tranſlators enclining to this ſenſe, thus inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret it, <hi>I ſhall walke,</hi> in relation to the divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, whereby he ſhould be preſerved yet longer to live on earth: ſo as, according to this acception, to <hi>walke before the Lord,</hi> is to live to advance the glory of God. A pious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation this is. But this phraſe of <hi>walking before the Lord,</hi> is in Scripture moſt frequently uſed to ſet out a duty on mans part, rather then a kindneſſe on Gods part: for God requireth it of <note n="a" place="margin">Gen 17. 1.</note>
                     <hi>Abraham</hi> as a duty: and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <note n="b" place="margin">2 Chro. 6. 16</note>
                     <hi>David</hi> for it, as for a duty performed by him. To this acception do the <hi>Kings Tranſlators</hi> incline, and tranſlate it as a promiſe made on the Prophets part to God, thus, <hi>I will walke.</hi> By this manner of expreſſing his purpoſe under a ſolemne promiſe, he bindeth himſelfe to performe the duty promiſed. This word, <hi>walke,</hi> importeth a motion, and a proceeding on in that motion ſtep by ſtep, from place to place. Metaphorically it is taken for a practice of good or evill. The words joyned with it will ſhew what kind of practice it importeth. <note n="c" place="margin">1 King. 15. 26</note>To <hi>walk in the way of the wicked</hi> is to practice evill: <note n="d" place="margin">Ier 7. 6.</note>To <hi>walke after other Gods</hi> is to practice Idolatry.

                  <p>The fleſh remaineth in ſuch as have the ſpirit in them. By virtue of the Spirits abode in them they are Saints, true Saints: but by reaſon of the mixture of the fleſh, they are ſubject to ſymptomes, effects and infirmities of the fleſh, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong which, ſudden paſſions may well be reckoned.

Yea demonſtrations enough may be made againſt every one that beareth the name of a Saint, that he onely beareth the name of a Saint, but is no Saint. Thus ſhall all be brought into the labyrinth of deſpaire, out of which they cannot know how to winde themſelves.

                  <p>Such is our eſtate here in this world, and ſuch is Gods dealing with us, as there never wanteth occaſion of both. Never was any Saint brought into ſo deſperate a diſtreſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that thorow the miſt of his miſery ſweet beames of Gods mercy have ſhined upon him. Nor ever was there any ſet in ſo bright and cleare a ſun-ſhine of Gods favour, but that ſome clouds have let fall ſhowers of ſorrowes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if not in outward troubles, yet in regard of inward corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yea and in the thought or feare of ſome eclipſes of that ſun-ſhine. Thus in greateſt occaſion of hearty thankſgiving, there is juſt occaſion of humble petition. And where there is moſt cauſe of humiliation, there is alſo much cauſe of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ultation.</p>
                  <p>Herein lyeth a maine difference betwixt mens eſtates here and hereafter. Hereafter in Heauen is nothing but matter of gratulation: in Hell is nothing but matter of exclamation and ejulation. On Earth there is a mixture of both.</p>
                  <p>As for adding invocation to gratulation, which is the particular here expreſſed, thereby our ſacrifice of praiſe is <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 5.</note>ſanctified.

A true intention and deliberate purpoſe muſt of neceſſity go before, becauſe otherwiſe a promiſe will not be made (for who will promiſe that which he intends not) or if it be made, there is little hope it wilbe performed: or if it ſhould be performed, yet the very making of it without an intention and purpoſe, is a plaine mocking of him who is a <note n="e" place="margin">Acts 1. 24.</note>

                     <hi>underſtandeth our thoughts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farre off.</hi> This therefore is neceſſary, but not ſufficient. For, a vow bindeth, as we ſhall hereafter ſhew: but every purpoſe bindeth not. <note n="g" place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 15, &amp;c.</note>After Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was minded to

come to <hi>Corinth,</hi> he altered his purpoſe upon juſt occaſions. Many purpoſes come into me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s minds time after time. If they had the force of a binding vow, who ſhould be looſe? Nay with how many bounds would every Saint be bound? Their caſe would be inextricable. They would have ſo many fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and manicles, and chaines on them, as they could not tell how to ſhake them off: how to rid themſelves. Many weake Chriſtians that take every purpoſe for a vow, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly perplexed, partly thorow their care to performe thoſe purpoſes, and partly thorow their griefe at their fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings in thoſe performances: ſuppoſing that they have bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſo many vowes. But to the eſſence of a vow muſt be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded an abſolute promiſe. <hi>Abſolute,</hi> I ſay, in relation to mans <note place="margin">Vowes abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute.</note>faithfull endeavour with his uttermoſt power to performe it: not in relation (or rather oppoſition) to Gods purpoſe or providence, to his will or leave. For, ſo can no man make an <hi>abſolute</hi> promiſe. God can croſſe and hinder him. <note n="h" place="margin">Iam. 4. 13, &amp;c</note>Saint <hi>Iames</hi> doth juſtly taxe ſuch as in this caſe make abſolute, or rather peremptory promiſes. This abſolute promiſe I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed under this word, <hi>obteſtation,</hi> which is a fit word to expreſſe the nature of a vow. It ſignifieth <hi>a taking of God to witneſſe,</hi> and that in particular for performing his purpoſe. This <hi>obteſtation,</hi> maketh it indeed a vow.</p>
                  <p>Obiect. <hi>Many vowes recorded in Scripture are conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall: as</hi> Iacobs, <note n="i" place="margin">Gen. 28. 20.</note>If God will be with me, &amp;c. <hi>And</hi> Hannahs, <note n="k" place="margin">1 Sam. 1. 11.</note>If thou wilt indeed, &amp;c. <hi>and others.</hi>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> A conditionall ſentence doth not neceſſarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porta doubtfull matter, but is oft uſed as a ground of an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and undeniable concluſion. As where <hi>Eliah</hi> ſaith, <note n="l" place="margin">1 King. 18. 21</note>
                     <hi>If the Lord be God, follow him.</hi> Doth he here make any queſtion of the <hi>Lords</hi> being God? Farre be ſuch a thought. But hereby he brings them the more evidently to ſee their folly, and drawes them from <hi>Baal,</hi> to follow the Lord: as will clearely appeare if we bring it into the forme of a <hi>ſyllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſme,</hi> thus, <hi>If the Lord be God, follow him. But the Lord is God. Therefore follow him.</hi> A condition or ſuppoſition re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecteth the manner, rather then the matter of a vow.
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:3461:97"/>
When in making a vow a neceſſary ſuppoſition is uſed, the vow is never a whit the leſſe abſolute, but the more diſcreet. As when I thus vow, If the Lord aſſiſt me, I will every morning pray before I go out of doores. Such a vow was <hi>Iacobs.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2 <hi>Annah</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> and others like to them might have by ſpeciall and divine inſtinct, ſome aſſurance of that which they expreſſed in forme of ſuppoſition, and in that reſpect their vow be abſolute. Queſtionleſſe <hi>Hannah</hi> had aſſurance that the Lord would give her a <hi>man-child,</hi> which made her in ſuch particular and expreſſe termes vow to <hi>give him to</hi>

                  <p n="3">3 When a vow is made upon a condition, if the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hold and be, as it is ſuppoſed, accompliſhed, then the vow remaineth as abſolute, as if there were no condition. And the maker of the vow is as much bound in this caſe to performe it, as if it had beene made in the moſt abſolute termes that can be. Yea the condition may be ſuch, as it will more bind a man to his vow, then if there had beene no condition: as when the condition is a kind of conſideration or a benefit in conſideration whereof the vow is made. Thus if in a ſtorme on ſea, a man vow to give ſo much to the poore, if he be brought in ſafety to his country: This providence of God in keeping him ſafe, and bringing him home, more binds him to that worke of charity, then the moſt abſolute vow that he could have made. <note n="m" place="margin">Gen 28. 20.</note>

                  <p>Thus then it is evident that a vow is an abſolute promiſe of a deliberate purpoſe. Such a promiſe on ſuch a ground doth as much order and bind the promiſe-maker, as the command of one in authority doth order and bind him that is under authority.</p>

                     </note> In regard of this object to whom our vowes are to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, it is not neceſſary that they be uttered with words, or manifeſted by ſignes. When <hi>Hannah</hi> vowed her ſolemne vow unto God, it is ſaid, <hi>She ſpake in her heart,</hi> (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 13.) Indeed the earneſtneſſe of her affection, made her move her lips, and uſe ſuch outward motions as <hi>Elie</hi> diſcerned her to be in ſome paſſion: but thoſe were no ſignes of a vow. No creature could certenly have knowne thereby that ſhe vowed a vow. As true and full a reſolution, yea, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation and promiſe too, may proceed from the ſoule by the very thoughts thereof, and be as well knowne to God, and as ſtrongly bind a man, as by words or ſignes.</p>
                  <p>Words and ſignes are of good uſe to teſtifie to man ſuch vowes as wee make to God, that thereby wee may bee held ſomewhat the cloſer to them: yea and to quicken our owne ſpirits the more, words are of uſe. But to the being <note place="margin">

                  <p>Concerning the poſition it ſelfe of making vowes to Saints,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 The holy Scriptures give no intimation of any ſuch matter; but where it maketh any mention of vowes, it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth them to God: whereof the Papiſts are not ignorant.

                  <p n="2">2 All both ancient and later divines, both Proteſtants and Papiſts that treat of vowes, define it to be a promiſe whereby he that makes it, binds himſelfe in a ſacred and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne manner to God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 None denie but that a ſacred vow is a religious act, and a part of divine worſhip, and in that reſpect due onely to God. To make it to any other is plaine and palpable idolatry: yet ordinarily their vowes uſe to be made to this Saint and that Saint.</p>

Eſpecially if wee have juſt

Zealous Martyrs, upon a ſetled reſolution not to ſtart in ſhew from that profeſſion which they are about to ſeale with their bloud, being jealous of their weake fleſh, and ſenſibleneſſe of paine, have deſired to bee faſt bound to the ſtake.

                  <p n="1">1 On thoſe vowes whereunto by vertue of thy Chriſtian profeſſion thou art bound, being ſolemnly made at thy Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, at receiving the Lords Supper, and in publike prayer, oft and ſeriouſly meditate, day and night, when thou lieſt downe, and when thou riſeſt up, when thou tarieſt at home, and when thou goeſt abroad, eſpecially when thou underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt any duty of piety, and art about in prayer to preſent thy ſelfe before God; but moſt of all when thou art preſent at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Baptiſme, and heareſt the very vow which thou thy ſelfe mad'ſt before God. Frequent meditation on vowes, is an eſpeciall meanes to keep them freſh in memory: a freſh remembrance of them putteth life into the conſcience, and maketh it ſenſible: a quick and ſenſible conſcience is afraid of wounds. Feare of wounds makes carefull in avoiding the things which make wounds: as breach of vowes doth. This therefore muſt needes bee a good helpe for keeping vowes, and performing them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Oft renew thy vowes, and ſo bind thy ſelfe againe and againe thereto. A vow renewed is as new made. Men uſe
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:3461:100"/>
to be very tender of their vowes, when they are new made, or while they remaine freſh: as they are of a new ſute of apparell, or of their linnen while it is cleane and neate.</p>
                  <p>This direction of renewing vowes is to be applied to vowes of neceſſary and bounden duties. But if vowes made be of ſuch circumſtances as are not neceſſary, yet very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, and cannot eaſily be performed, and much trouble and <note place="margin">Si praeproperè ſa ct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

I adde this attribute, <hi>pious,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, to ſhew that it was an action of piety, a part of divine worſhip. In every ſacrifice ſomething either with, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out life, was brought, and by the Prieſt, in the name of him that brought it, offered to the Lord. Herein lieth a maine difference betwixt this, and other rites, and in ſpeciall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a ſacrifice and a ſacrament. The eſſentiall action of a <note place="margin">Wherein a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from a ſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>crament.</note>ſacrament is a receiving from God; of a ſacrifice, an offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to God.

So they which were circumciſed received the ſeale of remiſſion of ſinnes. They which celebrated the Paſſeouer received the ſcale of deliverance from bondage. They alſo which eate Manna, and dranke the water that flowed out of the rock (<note n="b" place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 3, 4</note>which anſwered to the Sacrament of the Lords Supper) apparently received both ſpirituall and temporall bleſſings from the Lord. But in all manner of ſacrifices ſomething was brought and offered to the Lord, as will more evidently appeare by a particular enumeration of the ſeverall ſacrifices: which may thus be diſtinguiſhed.</p>

                  <p>As occaſions of thankfulneſſe are offered unto us, and as by Gods Spirit we are moved to take thoſe occaſions for gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing thanks, let us here learne how to order, how to ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, how to make the ſame acceptable to God. Though the particular ceremony of worſhipping God by ſacrifices be now abrogated, yet the generall equity of performing due worſhip to God, doth ſtill, and ever ſhall remaine in force. Take notice therefore of that manner of worſhipping God which now under the Goſpell is warrantable. The parts of divine worſhip are prayer, ſinging of Pſalmes, reading, prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, hearing the Word, and celebrating the Sacraments. Theſe are as ſacrifices of bullocks and calves, goats and kids, ſheepe and lambs, turtles, pigeons, ſpartowes: and all manner of meat and drink-offerings.

If a vow be made againſt any ſinne, or againſt temptations or occaſions that lead thereto, it is becauſe by ſinne God is offended and diſhonoured. Now to vow againſt that whereby God is offended and diſhonoured, is implicitly to pleaſe and to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God. If a vow be made for performing any duty, that is made ſomewhat the more directly to the honour and praiſe of God: for, all good duties tend thereunto. Now, becauſe there is nothing wherein and whereby we can more honour God, or better teſtifie our reſpect to God, then by giving praiſe to him, to praiſe God muſt needs be a very fit ſubject for a vow: yea the beſt that can be.</p>

When to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void ſinne, a vow is made, it is to gaine aſſurance of pardon for that ſinne before committed, and aſſiſtance againſt it for the time to come. Though in theſe and other like caſes a vow be made before the kindneſſe, for which it is made, be

It is an hill of peace, an hill of joy, and hill of life, an hill of glory. We count cities and townes that have Kings and Noblemens houſes in them, happy, by reaſon of the great proviſion, and all manner of commodities that are brought to them. Much more happy may we account thoſe cities and townes where are many houſes of God: if indeed they be true houſes of God. Externall buildings made with ſtone or bricke, timber, lead, iron, and other ſuch materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls, though never ſo pompous and glorious without and within, can not juſtly be accounted Gods houſes, if Gods people aſſemble not in them to worſhip God, if Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances be not there duly obſerved, if there be no prayers made to God, no Word of God preached, no Sacraments adminiſtred, no divine diſcipline exerciſed in them.

                  <p>They had above two hundred walled and fenced
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:3461:139"/>
townes for their refuge and ſafety.</p>
                  <p>Many of the greateſt nobility in France were their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zans, and ſeemed moſt affectionate to the religion.</p>
                  <p>They had troupes and armies of men well diſciplined in armes, with many brave Commanders, and old-beaten ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</p>
                  <p>They were well provided with all ſtore of amunition. Nothing requiſite for defence and ſafety was wanting in mans imagination.</p>
                  <p>It is to be feared that they were too confident in the arme of fleſh: which that they might the more thorowly diſcerne, the Lord withdrew his protection, and left them to defend themſelves againſt the power of their owne Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, which at firſt they too much ſleighted.</p>
                  <p>Soone after that their now Soveraigne had raiſed and brought his forces againſt them, many of their chiefeſt Commanders revoulted, their ſouldiers were ſlaine, their treaſures exhauſted, their cities and townes of defence were violently wreſted from them, or treacherouſly given up: many bloudy maſſacres were made among them: and the miſerable effects of warre ſo depopulated their countrie, and deſtroyed their perſons, as they were left deſtitute without all ſuccour, or hope of reliefe: And ſince the laſt taking in of <hi>Rochel,</hi> the King, who was of a contrary religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to them, became an abſolute Maſter of them.</p>
                  <p>What now in mans eye could be looked for, but that ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly they ſhould be deprived of the liberty of their religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and by little and little be enforced to the idolatrous ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition of the <hi>Romiſh Church:</hi> or at leaſt be bred up in blindneſſe and ignorance, being left without the light of the Goſpell to guide, and comfort them in that their miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable condition?</p>
                  <p>Yet now in theſe happy daies of deliverances, behold how in their greateſt extremity, when all humane meanes failed them, the Lord of hoſts hath beyond all hope affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them much peace and quietnes; and provided for them new Churches, built with their Kings good leave, yea and
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:3461:140"/>
at his coſt and charges, becauſe they had beene demoliſhed by the fury of impious ſouldiers, and by the out-rage of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious people.</p>
                  <p>Thorow that liberty which now they enjoy, their Churches are diligently frequented, and all Gods ordinances duly obſerved, and their religion with leſſe ſcorne and deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion profeſſed, then formerly.</p>
                  <p>Their peace and ſecurity is now greater then when they had the fore-mentioned meanes to embolden them to ſtand upon their owne guard.</p>
                  <p>This is the Lords doing. It is marvellous in our eyes.</p>
                  <p>They had no <hi>Moſes,</hi> no <hi>Ioſhua</hi> to worke for them.</p>
                  <p>As they had no power within to defend them from the might and malice of their enemie, ſo they could expect no aid from abroad to encourage them to ſtand out againſt their enemies. All the aid that from abroad was afforded unto them, proved altogether in vaine.</p>

                  <p>FRom reformed Churches in <hi>France</hi> we will paſſe to the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> who are of the ſame profeſſion.</p>
                  <p>In recounting Gods late mercies to them (which is the taske that we have undertaken: thereby to ſhew what great cauſe we now have to ſet out the praiſes of the Lord) it would be too farre a digreſſion to begin with thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary deliverances which they had when firſt they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered their liberty againſt the cruelty and tyranny of Duke <hi>D' Alva.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Later mercies are theſe that follow.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 A ſtrong faction of Arminians being raiſed up and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed thorowout all their provinces, whereby the truth and purity of religion was much corrupted, and the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity and ſecurity of their State put into great hazard, a <hi>Nationall Synod,</hi> not without the counſell and conſent of our royall <hi>Defender of the Faith, King</hi> IAMES, was aſſembled at <hi>Dort,</hi> whereunto moſt grave, learned, and judicious Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines out of all the reformed Churches in Chriſtendome came; who all with one unanimous conſent determined ſundry fundamentall points of our Chriſtian Religion againſt the contrary errors of the Adverſaries of Gods free grace. A mercy not to be forgotten.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 The enemy having gathered ſuch an army as made him maſter of the field whereby he ſo ſtrongly beſieged <hi>Breda,</hi> (a frontier town, of great command every way round about) as no ſuccour could be afforded it, but it was forced to yeeld, at which time alſo <hi>Grave Maurice, Prince of Orange,</hi> their brave <hi>Generall,</hi> died, great feare there was of much miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, if not of utter ruine, to befall that State. But by Gods <hi>Providence,</hi> their great enemy <hi>Spinola</hi> was called into another country, and a ſupply made of the loſſe of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>Generall,</hi> by ſubſtituting in his roome his owne bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whoſe prudence and proweſſe ſucceſſe hath crowned: ſo as they are now better ſecured then they were before.</p>

The whole fleet of gold, ſilver, and other rich merchandizes which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> by the helpe of the <hi>Weſt-Indians</hi> had beene ſundry yeares gathering together, the Nether-landers tooke on a ſudden: whereby their enemies were much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furniſhed, and they themſelves ſo plentifully furniſhed, as they were the better enabled, not onely to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but alſo to offend their enemies.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 The <hi>States</hi> being now well prepared, they quickly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come maſters of the field, and with much reſolution attempt that which the enemy little feared they ſhould attaine: namely to take in the <hi>Boſche,</hi> a very ſtrong frontier towne: well fenced, well manned, and every way well prepared and provided for. But they ſo beſiege it, as no reliefe can be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded to it: they ſo aſſault it, as there is no ſtanding out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. They take it, and keepe it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 While they lay at this ſiege, another booty falls into their hands. <hi>Weſell</hi> the magazin of their enemie, wherein all warlike proviſion was in great abundance ſtoared up, ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out ſome of their garriſons abroad, notice thereof comes to the armie of the <hi>States</hi> in ſiege at the <hi>Boſche.</hi> They forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſend ſome troupes to ſurprize <hi>Weſell</hi> on a ſudden. They come to it unexpected, and quickly take it. Thus are the <hi>States</hi> againe furniſhed with their enemies proviſion. They take a ſtrong towne of great conſequence, which is as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lett for them into the <hi>Palatinate.</hi> And by this meanes an enemy that with a great army was entred into their country, and burnt and ſpoiled all before him, was forced backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 This laſt yeare while the army of the <hi>States</hi> is quiet at home, the enemy having plotted ſome miſchievous deſigne againſt them, unexpectedly ſends an army by water into their territories, which (like a flocke of fooliſh birds) flew into nets that were not laid for them: and were taken.</p>
                  <p>What can we thinke, but that the finger of God hath beene in the ordering of theſe ſucceſſefull matters for the

                  <p>The Princes of the reformed Churches in <hi>Germany</hi> were forced to put up a joint complaint, and remonſtrance of their grievances, and to conſult about means, at leaſt of ſome eaſe (for their burdens were intollerable) if not of full redreſſe.</p>

                  <p>So proud was the enemy by reaſon of the great armies that he had gathered together, and ſo fleſht he was in the
