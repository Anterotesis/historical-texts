         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

against the daily incroachments of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Court, so a <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth at the
reformation of the English Church, did
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65458:5"/>
but tread in the steps of his most renowned
Ancestours, who flourished whilest Popery
was in its Zenith; And pursued but that
way which they had chalked out unto him,
a way warranted by the practise of the most
Christian Emperours of old, and frequented
at this day by the greatest, or rather by all
the Princes of the Roman Communion
so often as they find occasion. When
it shall be made evident, that the Bishops of
<hi>Rome</hi> never injoyed any quiet or settled
possession of that power which was after
deservedly cast out of England, so as to
beget a lawful prescription: And lastly,
that we have not at all separated our selves
from the Communion of the Catholick
Church, nor of any part thereof, <hi>Roman</hi> or
other, <hi>qua tales,</hi> as they are such, but only
in their innovations, wherein they have se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
themselves first from their Common
Mother, and from the fellowship of their
own Sisters; I say, when all this shall be
cleared, and the Schisme is brought home
and laid at the right door, then we may
safely conclude, that by how much we should
turn more Roman then we are, whilest
things continue in the same condition; by
so much we should render our selves lesse
Catholique, and plunge our selves deeper
into Schisme whilest we seek to avoid
it.</p>
               <p>3. For the clearer and fuller discussion
and demonstration whereof, I shall observe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65458:6"/>
this method in the Ensuing discourse.</p>
               <p>First to state the question,<note place="margin">The me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod observed in this Discourse.</note> and shew
what is Schisme in the abstract, who are
Schismatiques in the Concrete; and what
we understand by the Church of England in
this question.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I will lay down six grounds or
propositions, every one of which singly is
sufficient to wipe away the stain and guilt
of Schisme from the Church of <hi>England;</hi>
how much more when they are all joyned
together? My six grounds or Propositions
are these: First, that Protestants were not
the authors of the late great separation
from <hi>Rome,</hi> but Roman Catholicks them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
such as in all other points were chief
Advocates and Pillars of the Roman
Church, and so many, that the names of all
the known dissenters might be written in a
little ring. Secondly, that in abandoning
the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> they did not make any
new Law, but onely declare and restore the
old Law of the Land to its former Vigour;
And vindicate that liberty left them as an
inheritance by their Ancestours, from the
incroachments and usurpations of the Court
of <hi>Rome.</hi> Thirdly, that the ancient <hi>Brittish</hi>
and <hi>Scottish,</hi> or <hi>Irish</hi> Churches were ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
exempted from the Patriarchal Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
of the Roman Bishops, untill Rome
thirsting after an universal unlawful Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,
quitted their lawful Ecclesiastical pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
And so ought to continue free and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65458:6"/>
exempted from all forrein Jurisdiction of
any pretended Patriarch for evermore, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the famous Canon of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Councel of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> which <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>egory</hi> the
Great reverenced as one of the four Gospels.
Fourthly, that though the Authors of that
Separation had not themselves been Roman
Catholicks, and though the Acts or Statutes
made for that end had not been meerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarative,
but also operative; And although
<hi>Brittain</hi> had not been from the beginning
both <hi>de jure</hi> and <hi>de facto</hi> exempted from Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Jurisdiction, yet the King and Church
of England had both sufficient authority
and sufficient grounds to withdraw their
obedience as they did. Fifthly, that all the
Soveraign Princes and Republicks in <hi>Europe</hi>
of the Roman Communion, whensoever
they have occasion to reduce the Pope to
reason, do either practise or plead for the
same right, or both. Sixthly, that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy
it self <hi>(qua t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lis)</hi> as it is now maintained
by many, with universality of Jurisdiction,
or rather sole Jurisdiction, <hi>Iure divino,</hi> with
superiority above General Councels, with
infallibility of Judgment, and temporal
power over Princes, is become by its rigid
censures, and new Creeds, and Exorbitant
decrees, in a great part actually, and altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
causally, guilty both of this and all the
greater Schismes in Christendome.</p>
               <p>3. Lastly, I will give a satisfactory answer
to those objections, which those of the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65458:7"/>
Roman Communion do bring against us to
prove us Schismaticks.</p>

one another, and to expel one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from their Communion, and are ready
to submit to the determinations of a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Councel. Such were the contentions of
the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>African</hi> Bishops about re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptization

say, that those two blessed Saints, <hi>Cyprian</hi>

With this general truth agrees that
of Doctor <hi>Holden</hi> fully,<note place="margin">Hen Holden Append. de Schis. Act. 1. pag 484.</note> that <hi>when there is a
mutual division of two parts or members of the
mystical body of the Church, one from the other,
yet both retein Communion with the Vniversal
Church, which for the most part springs from
some doubtful opinion, or lesse necessary part of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65458:8"/>
divine worship; quamcun<expan>
                        <am>

universa ecclesia neutram damnarit, whatsoever
part one take he is no Schismatick, because the
universal Church hath condemned neither part.</hi>
Whether he hold himself to this principle,
or desert it, it is not my purpose here to
discusse.</p>
               <p>But this is much sounder doctrine then
that of Mr. <hi>Knott,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Infidelity unmasked, Sect. 176. pag. 591.</note> that <hi>the parts of the
Church cannot be divided one from another, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
they be divided from the whole, because
these things which are united to one third, are
united also between themselves.</hi> Which errour
he would seem to have sucked from Doctor
<hi>Potter,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Idem. pag. 516.</note> whom he either would not, or at
least did not understand, That <hi>whosoever
professeth himself to forsake the Communion of
any one member of the body of Christ, must
confesse himself consequently to forsake the
whole.</hi> Of which he makes this use<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That
Protestants forsake the Communion of the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> And yet do confesse it to
be a member of the body of Christ, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they forsake the Communion of the
whole Church. The answer is easie, that
whosoever doth separate himself from any
part of the Catholique Church as it is a
part of the Catholick Church, doth separate
himself from every part of the Catholick
Church, and consequently from the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
Church, which hath no existence but in
its parts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:65458:8"/>
But if one part of the Universal Church
do separate it self from another part, not
absolutely, or in Essentials, but respectively
in abuses and innovations, not as it is a part
of the Universal Church, but only so far as
it is corrupted and degenerated, it doth still
retein a Communion, not onely with the
Catholick Church and with all Orthodox
Members of the Catholick Church, but even
with that corrupted Church from which it
is separated, except onely in corruptions.
We may well inlarge the former ground, that
if two particular Churches shall separate
themselves one from another, And the one
retein a communion with the Universal
Church, and be ready to submit to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations
thereof; And the other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
the Communion of the Universal
Church, and contumaciously despise the
Jurisdiction and the decrees thereof; the
former continues Catholick, and the later
becomes Schismatical. To shew that this
is our present condition with the Church of
Rome, is in part the Scope of this Treatise.
They have subjected Oecumenical Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels,
which are the Soveraign Tribunals of
the Church, to the Jurisdiction of the Papal
Court. And we are most ready in all our
differences to stand to the judgment of the
truly Catholick Church and its lawful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentative,
a free general Councel.</p>
               <p>But we are not willing to have their vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Church, that is the Court of Rome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65458:9"/>
upon us for the Catholick Church,
nor a partial Synod of <hi>Italians</hi> for a free
general Councel.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">The Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raters may be free from Schisme, and the other party guilty.</note> there may be an actual and cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous
separation of Churches which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
did joyn in one and the same Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion;
And yet the Separaters be inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
and the persons from whom the sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
is made be nocent and guilty of
Schisme, because they gave just cause of
separation from them: It is not the separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but the cause that makes the Schisme.
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> himself made such a separation
among his disciples:<note place="margin">Act. 19. 9.</note> And <hi>Timothy</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
commanded,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 5.</note> that <hi>if any man did teach
otherwise, and consented not to wholsome words,
even to the words of our Lord Iesus Christ, and
to the doctrine which is according to godlinesse,</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, withdraw thy self,
stand aloof, or separate thy self from such
persons. It is true, that they who first desert
and forsake the Communion of their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
brethren, are Schismaticks; but there
is a moral defection as well as local: It is
no Schisme to forsake them, who have first
themselves forsaken the common faith;
wherein we have the confession of our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries,<note place="margin">Infid. un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masked, Ch. 7. Sect. 112. pag. 534.</note> 
                  <hi>They who first separated themselves
from the primitive pure Church, and brought in
corruptions in faith, practice, Leiturgy, and use
of Sacraments, may truly be said to have been
hereticks, by departing from the pure faith; and
Schismaticks, by dividing themselves from the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65458:9"/>
external communion of the true uncorrupted
Church.</hi> It is no Schisme to separate from
hereticks and Schismaticks in their heresie
and Schisme. This is all the Crime which
they can object to us. The Court of <hi>Rome</hi>
would have obtruded upon us new articles
of faith, we have rejected them; They
introduced unlawful rites into the Leiturgies
of the Church, and use of the Sacraments,
we have reformed them for our selves: They
went about to violate the just liberties and
priviledges of our Church, we have vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
them. And for so doing they have
by their Censures and Bulls separated us and
chased us from their communion; where
lies the Schisme?</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">To with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is not alwaies criminous Schisme.</note> to withdraw obedience from
a particular Church, or from a lawful Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour,
is not alwaies criminous Schisme.
Particular Churches may sometimes erre,
and sometimes clash with the universal
Church. Patriarchs and other subordinate
Superiours may erre, and sometimes abuse
their authority, sometimes forfeit their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
sometimes disclaim their authority,
or usurp more authority then is due unto
them by the Canons. They would perswade
us,<note place="margin">Idem. pag. 481.</note> that <hi>obedience is to be yeelded to a Church
determining errours in points not fundamental.</hi>
But they confound obedience of acquiescence
with obedience of conformity. They for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
willingly that we acknowledge not that
they ever had any lawful authority over us;
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65458:10"/>
                  <hi>par in parem non habet potestatem.</hi> Equals
have no Jurisdiction over their equals. The
onely difficulty is, that this seems to make
Inferiours Judges of their Superiours, the
flock of their Pastour, the Clergy of their
Bishop, the Bishop of his Metropolitan,
the Metropolitan of his Patriarch; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
in truth it onely gives them a Judgment of
discretion, and makes them not to be Judges
of their Superiours, but onely to be their
own Judges, <hi>salvo moderamine inculpatae
tutelae,</hi> to preserve themselves from sin or
heresie obtruded upon them under the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
pretences of obedience and Charity.
This is not <hi>deficere,</hi> but <hi>prospicere;</hi> not to
renounce due obedience to their lawful Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours,
but to provide for their own
safety.</p>
               <p>Some things are so evident, that the
Judgment of the Church or a Superiour is
not needfull. Some things have been already
judged and defined by the Church, and need
no new determination.</p>
               <p>If a Superiour presume to determine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the determination of the Church,
it is not rebellion but loyalty to disobey
him.</p>

               <p>It cannot be denied,<note place="margin">Libel. ad mancit. apud Bar. to. 8. an. 590. nu. 39.</note> but that among many

Schismes or seditious segregations of an
aggregate body into two opposite parties:
And there seems to me to be the same diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between heresie properly so called, and
Schisme, which is between an inward sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and an outward wound or ulcer. He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie
floweth from the corruption of faith
within; Schisme is an exteriour breach, or
a solution of continuity in the body Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastick:
Consider then by what nerves and
Ligaments the body of the Church is united
and knit together, and by so many manner
of ruptures it may be schismatically rent or
divided asunder.</p>
               <p>The Communion of the Christian Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church is partly internal,<note place="margin">Wherein internal Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth consist.</note> partly exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.
The internal Communion consists
principally in these things: To believe the
same intire substance of saving necessary
truth revealed by the Apostles, and to be
ready implicitly in the preparation of the
mind to embrace all other supernatural ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
when they shall be sufficiently propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to them; To judge charitably one of
another; To exclude none from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Communion and hope of salvation,
either Eastern, or Western, or Southern, or
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65458:11"/>
Northern Christians, which professe the
ancient faith of the Apostles and primitive
Fathers, established in the first general
Councels, and comprehended in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick
<hi>Nicene</hi> and <hi>Athanasian</hi> Creed, To
rejoyce at their well-doing, To sorrow for
their sins, To condole with them in their
sufferings, To pray for their constant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance
in the true Christian Faith, for
their reduction from all their respective
errours, and their re-union to the Church in
case they be divided from it, that we may
be all one sheepfold under that one great
Shepherd and Bishop of our Soules. And
lastly, to hold an actual external Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with them <hi>in Votis,</hi> in our desires, and to
endeavour it by all those means which are in
our power. This internal Communion is
of absolute necessity among all Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks.</p>
               <p>External Communion consists first in the
same Creeds or Symbols,<note place="margin">Wherein External Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion doth consist.</note> or Confessions of
Faith, which are the ancient badges or cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisances
of Christianity. Secondly, in the
participation of the same Sacraments. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
in the same external worship and frequent
use of the same divine offices or Leiturgies,
or Forms of serving God. Fourthly, in the
use of the same publick Rites and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.
Fifthly, in giving communicatory
Letters from one Church or one person to
another. And lastly, in admission of the
same discipline, and subjection to the same
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65458:12"/>
supream Ecclesiastical authority, that is,
Episcopacy, or a general Councel; for as
single Bishops are the heads of particular
Churches, so Episcopacy, that is, a general
Councel, or Oecumenical Assembly of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,

               <p>Internal communion is due alwaies from
all Christians to all Christians, even to those
with whom we cannot communicate exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
in many things, whether <hi>credenda,</hi> or
<hi>agenda,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">External Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion may be suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note> opinions or practises. But external
actual communion may sometimes be suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
more or lesse by the just censures of the
Church, <hi>clave non errante.</hi> As in the primitive
times some were excluded <hi>a coetu participan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium,</hi>
Only from the use of the Sacraments;
others moreover, <hi>a coetu procumbentium,</hi> both
from Sacraments and Prayers; others also,
<hi>a coetu audientium,</hi> from Sacraments, Prayers,
and Sermons: and lastly, some, <hi>a coetu fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delium,</hi>
from the society of Christians. And
as external communion may be suspended,
so likewise it may sometimes be waved or
withdrawn by particular Churches or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
from their neighbour Churches or
Christians in their innovations and errours.<note place="margin">And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn.</note>
Especially when they go about to obtrude
new fancies upon others for fundamental
truths and old Articles of faith. Christian
charity is not blind so as not to distinguish
the integral and essential parts of the body,
from superfluous wens and excrescences. The
Canons do not oblige Christians to the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65458:12"/>
dictates of a Patriarch, or to suck in
all his errours, like those servile flatterers of
<hi>Dionysius</hi> the <hi>Sicilian</hi> Tyrant, who licked up
his very spettle, and protested it was more
sweet then Nectar.</p>
               <p>Neither is there the like degree of obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to an exact Communion in all Externals.<note place="margin">There is not the like neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating in all Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternals.</note>
There is not so great conformity to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
in Ceremonies, as in the Essentials of
Sacraments, (the Queens daughter was array<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in a garment wrought about, with divers
colours) nor in all Sacraments improperly
and largely so called by some persons at
some times, as in Baptisme and the holy Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist,
which by the consent of all parties
are more general, more necessary, more
principal Sacraments. Neither is so exact
an harmony and agreement necessary in all
the explications of articles of faith, as in the
Articles themselves; nor in superstructions,
as in fundamentals, nor in Scholastical opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
as in catechetical grounds. Nor so
strict and perpetual an adherence required
to a particular Church, as to the Universal
Church; nor to an Ecclesiastical constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as to a divine Ordinance, or Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
tradition. Humane priviledges may be
lost by disuse, or by abuse. And that which
was advisedly established by humane autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
may by the same authority upon suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
grounds and mature deliberation be
more advisedly abrogated. As the limits
and distinctions of Provinces and Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chates

were at first introduced to comply
with the civil government, according to the
distribution of the Provinces of the Roman
Empire, for the preservation of peace and
unity, and for the ease and benefit of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
so they have been often, and may now
be changed by Soveraign and Synodical

               <p>The British Churches were never judged

neither lawful nor possible.</p>
               <p>Yea, if any particular Patriarch, Prelate,

shall endeavour to obtrude their own singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities
upon others for Catholique verities,
or shall injoyn sinful duties to their Subjects,
or shall violate the undoubted priviledges
of their inferiours, contrary to the Canons
of the Fathers; It is very lawful for their
own Subjects to disobey them, and for
strangers to separate from them. And if
either the one or the other have been drawn
to partake of their errours, upon pretence of
obedience or of Catholique communion,
they may without the guilt of Schisme, nay
they ought to reform themselves, so as it be
done by lawfull authority, upon good
grounds, with due moderation, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse,

as the separation from them be not total,

And much more if he should endeavour to destroy
the Church; I say it is lawful to resist him by
not doing that which he commands, and by hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
him from putting his will in execution.</hi>
We ask no more. The Pope invaded our
soules by exacting new Oaths, and obtruding
new Articles of faith. He troubled the
Common-Wealth with his extorsions and
usurpations: He destroyed the Church by
his provisions, reservations, exemptions, &amp;c.

If it be not only lawful but necessary

under the pain of damnation, for every

But not exclusively, to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
or shutting out of other Churches, or

or that there were no other Soveraign Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in the world but himself; So the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> is called a Catholick Church; and
the Bishop of Rome a Catholique Bishop:
And yet other Churches and other Bishops
may be as Catholick, and more Catholick
then they. I like the name of Catholick
well, but the addition of Roman is in truth a
diminution.</p>
               <p>Schisme for the most part is changeable,<note place="margin">Schisme is change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</note>
and varies its Symptomes as the Chamaelion
colours. As it was said of the Schisme of
the Donatists, that <hi>the passion of a disordered

and covetousnesse confirmed it.</hi> And therefore
it is as hard a task to shape a coat for Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks,
as for the Moon, which changeth
its shape every day. The reason is, because
having once deserted the Catholick commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
they find no beaten path to walk in
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:65458:16"/>
but are like men running down a steep hill
that cannot stay themselves, or like sick
persons that tosse and turn themselves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
from one side of their bed to the
other, searching for that repose which they
do not find: Hence it comes to passe, that
Schisme is very rarely found for any long
space of time without some mixture of
heretical pravity,<note place="margin">And for the most part complica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with heretical pravity,</note> it being the use of Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks
to broach some new doctrine for
the better justification of their separation
from the Church. Heretical errours in point
of faith do easily produce a Schisme and
Separation of Christians one from another
in the use of the Sacraments, and in the
publick service of God; As the Arrian he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie
produced a different doxology in the
Church, The Orthodox Christian saying.

holy Ghost;</hi> And the heretical Arrian, <hi>Glory
be to the Father by the Son, in the Spirit.</hi> So
of later times, the opinions of the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of detaining the cup from the Laity,
and of the necessity of adoring the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
have by consequence excluded the
Protestants from the participation of the
Eucharist in the Roman Church. Thus
Heresie doth naturally destroy unity and
uniformity: That is one Symptome of
Schisme.</p>
               <p>But it destroyes order also, and the due
subordination of a flock to their lawful Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stour,
nothing being more common with
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65458:17"/>
hereticks, then to contemne their old
guides, and to choose to themselves new
teachers of their own factions, and so erect
an altar against an altar in the Church: That
is another principal branch of Schisme. So
a different faith commonly produceth a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
discipline, and different formes of
worship.</p>
               <p>A man may render himself guilty of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical
pravity four wayes.<note place="margin">Four waies to become heretical.</note> First, by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing
any fundamental article of faith,
or necessary part of saving truth, in that
sense in which it was evermore received and
believed by the universal Church. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
by believing any superstitious errours or
additions which do virtually by necessary
and evident consequence subvert the faith,
and overthrow a fundamental truth. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
by maintaining lesser errours obstinately
after sufficient conviction. But because
that consequence which seems clear and
necessary to one man, may seem weak and
obscure to another; And because we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
penetrate into the hearts of men, to judg
whether they be obstinate, or do implicitely
and in the preparation of their minds believe
the truth, it is good to be sparing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
in censuring hereticks for obstinacy.
Fourthly, by maintaining lesser errours with
frowardnesse and opposition to lawfull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations.
Though it be not in the
power of any Councel, or of all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
in the world, to make that truth funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:65458:17"/>
which was not fundamental, or to
make that proposition heretical in it self,
which was not heretical ever from the daies
of the Apostles; Or to increase the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
Articles of the Christian faith, either in
number or substance; yet when inferiour
questions not fundamental are once defined
by a lawful general Councel, All Christians,
though they cannot assent in their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
are obliged to passive obedience, to
possesse their soules in patience. And they
who shall oppose the authority, and disturb
the peace of the Church, deserve to be

He is a Schismatick <hi>(qua talis,)</hi> whether
he be guilty of heretical pravity or not.</p>
               <p>Now having seen who are Schismaticks,
for clearing the state of the Question,
Whether the Church of England be Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
or not, it remaineth to shew in a
word, what we understand by the Church of
England.</p>
               <p>First,<note place="margin">What is understood by the Church of England.</note> we understand not the English Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
alone, but the English Dominion, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
the <hi>Brittish,</hi> and <hi>Scottish</hi> or <hi>Irish</hi>
Christians; for Ireland was the right <hi>Scotia

was then inhabited by Brittish and Irish,
under the names of <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Scots.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, though I make not the least
doubt in the world, but that the Church of
<hi>England</hi> before the reformation, and the
Church of England after the reformation,
are as much the same Church, as a garden

before it is weeded, and after it is weeded, is
the same garden; or a vine, before it be pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and after it is pruned and freed from
the Luxuriant branches, is one and the same
vine: yet because the Roman Catholiques
do not object Schisme to the Popish Church
of England, but to the reformed Church,
Therefore in this question, by the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> we understand that Church which
was derived by lineal succession from the
Brittish, English, and Scottish Bishops, by

be Schismatical by reason of its secession
and separation from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and the supposed withdrawing of its obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

                  </note>
I proceed to examine the first
ground or proposition: That the
English Protestants were not the
first authors of the separation, but princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
Roman Catholiques, great Advocates
in their dayes, and Pillars of the Roman
Church. Whether the Act or Statute of
Separation were operative or declarative,
creating new right, or manifesting, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing
old right, whether the power of the
Roman Court in England was just or usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
absolute and immutable, or conditional
and changeable; whether the possession
thereof was certain and settled, or contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
and unquiet, (though no man
throughly versed in our Lawes and Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
can reasonably doubt of these things,)
This is undeniably true, that the secession
and substraction of obedience was not made
by our reformers, or by any of their friends
or favourers, but by their capital Enemies
and persecutors, by Zelots of the Roman
Religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:65458:21"/>

To passe by many other Statutes, take the
very words of one of the main Acts it self,
<hi>That England is an Empire,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">24 <hi>Hen. 8. c.</hi> 12. Romanists first gave the King the title of Head of the Church.</note> and that <hi>the King
as Head of the body politick consisting of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituality
and temporalty, hath plenary power to
render final Iustice for all matters, &amp;c.</hi> First,
<hi>England is,</hi> that is, originally, not shall be by
vertue of this Act; what is it? <hi>an Empire.</hi>
If it be an Empire, then the Soveraignes
thereof have the same priviledges and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:65458:21"/>
within their own Dominions,
which the old Emperours had in theirs. If
the King be <hi>head of the body politick consisting
of the spi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ituality and temporalty,</hi> then in
<hi>England</hi> the King is the political head of the
Clergy, as well as of the Laity. So he ought
to be, and not he onely, but all the Soveraign
Princes throughout the World, by the very
Law of Nature.</p>
               <p>What becomes now of that grand excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
against Protestants, for making their
King the Head or Soveraign Governour
(for these two are convertible terms) of the
English Church or Clergy? A title first
introduced by Roman Catholicks, and since
waved and laid aside by Protestants, not so
much for any malignity that was in it, as for
the ill sounds sake, because it seemed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench
too much upon the just right of our
Saviour, and being subject to be misunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
gave offence to many well affected
Christians. And what doth this Law say
more then a great Cardinal said not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?
One that was as near the Papacy as
any that ever mist it, and was thought to
merit the Papacy as well as any that had it
in his daies. I mean Cardinal <hi>Pool</hi> in his
Book <hi>de concilio, Hoc munus Imperatoribus

Priestly head doth execute the Office of Christ
the true Head; but we may also truly say, that
the Emperour doth execute the office of Christ
as a Kingly Head.</hi> And so he concludeth;
Christ said of himself, <hi>All power is given me
both in heaven and earth:</hi> In utra<expan>

                        <g ref="char:abque"/>

&amp;c. <hi>Therefore we cannot doubt but
Christ hath his Deputies for both these powers;</hi>
The Pope in the Church, the Emperour in
the Common-Wealth. Thus writes the
Popes own Legate to his Brother Legates in
the <hi>Tridentine</hi> Councel, when he desired to
favour his Master as much as he could.</p>
               <p>But I proceed to our Statute; The King of

the fundamental constitution of the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy;
not shall have from henceforth, <hi>plenary
power,</hi> without the License or help or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence

that is, to receive the last appeales of his
own Subjects, without fear of any review
from Rome, or at Rome, <hi>for all matters</hi> Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
and temporal; Ecclesiastical by
his Bishops, Temporal by his Judges. There
is great difference between a Kings admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string
Justice in Ecclesiastical causes by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and by his Bishops. Listen to the

                  <hi>It hath

request of the Emperour the cognisance of publick

honour.</hi> But <hi>if he petition to the Emperour fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>not prejudice him.</hi> They forbid
a Bishop of his own accord, in these daies,
and in some cases to make his first addresse
for Justice to a secular Magistrate; But they
do not forbid him to appear before a secular
Magistrate being cited; And they allow him
in all cases though of pure Ecclesiastical
cognisance, to seek to a Soveraign Prince
for an equal indifferent hearing by Bishops
delegated and authorised by him.</p>
               <p>The testimony of this Statute is so clear
and authentick in it self, that it need not be
corroborated with any other acts of the
same kind. Yet three things are urged
against it. First, that <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth at
this time was a favourer of the Protestants.
Secondly, that he cared not for Religion,
but looked onely to the satisfaction of his
own humours and lusts. Thirdly, that to
withhold due obedience, is as Schismatical
as to withdraw it; And that the reformed
Church of <hi>England</hi> may be innocent of the
one, and yet guilty and accessary to the
other.</p>
               <p>To the first exception I reply,<note place="margin">Henry the <hi>8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
                     </hi> no friend to the Protestants.</note> That <hi>Henry</hi>
the eighth was so far both then and long
after from being a friend or favourer of the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:65458:23"/>
Protestants, that he was a most bitter perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor
of them. After this the Pope himself,
(though he was not well pleased to lose so
sweet a morsel as <hi>England</hi> was) so well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's rigorous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
against the Protestants, that he
proposed him to the Emperour as a pattern
for his imitation.<note place="margin">Hist. Conc. Trid.</note> Insomuch as some stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
in those daies coming into England,
have admired to see one suffer for denying
the Popes Supremacy, and another for being
a Protestant at the same time. So though
they looked divers waies, yet like <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>
Foxes each had his firebrand at his
taile.</p>
               <p>But to clear this point home, there needs
no more but to view the order of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
made concerning Religion and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Jurisdiction in the raign of that
King.</p>
               <p>The Act for no person to be cited out
of his own Diocesse,<note place="margin">23. H. 8.</note> except in certain cases.
The Act prohibiting all appeales out of
<hi>England</hi> to the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi>

And the Act for utterly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguishing
the usurped authority of the

books) they were all received and establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in <hi>Ireland</hi> the very same year, the Lord
<hi>Gray</hi> being then Lord Deputy of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
All this while there were no thoughts of any
reformation; All this while the Protestants
found little grace from King <hi>Henry;</hi> nor
indeed throughout his whole raign, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily.</p>
               <p>As for the suppression of Monasteries in
his time,<note place="margin">The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors op<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</note> I shall deal clearly, and declare
what I conceive to be the judgment of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
English Protestants concerning that
Act. First, we feare that covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
had a great oare in the boat, and that
sundry of the principal Actors had a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
aime at the goods of the Church, then at
the good of the Church: Or otherwise
why did they not (as they pretended and
gave out) preserve the spoiles of the cloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
for publick and charitable uses, as the
foundation of Hospitalls, and freeing the
common Wealth from a great part of its
necessary charges?<note place="margin">Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of beggars.</note> why did they not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
the appropriated, (or as we call them
truly impropriated tythes) to the Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bents
and lawful owners, who had actuall
cure of souls? from whom they had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly
withheld, especially considering that
in some parishes the poore vicars stipend
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:65458:24"/>
was not sufficient to maintain a good Plow-man.
The Monks pretended that they had
able members to discharge the cure of souls,
and what difference whether the Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent
were a single person, or an aggregated
body? But what meer Lay-men could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
is beyond my understanding.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we examine not whether the
abuses which were then brought to light
were true or feined; but this we believe, that
foundations which were good in their origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
institution ought not to be destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for accessary abuses; or for the faults of
particular persons. So we should neither
leave a Sun in heaven, for that hath been
adored by Pagans; nor a spark of fire, or
any eminent creature, how beneficial soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
upon earth, for they have all been abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
Therefore <hi>Licurgus</hi> is justly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
because out of an hatred to drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness
he cut down all the Vines in <hi>Sparta;</hi>
whereas he should have brought the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
of water nearer.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, when the Clergy in a Kingdome
are really, (and not upon the feined pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenses
of Sacrilegious persons) grown to
that excessive Grandeur, that they quite
overballance the Laity, and leave the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
wealth, neither sufficient men nor suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
means to maintain it self, it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
by prudent lawes to restrain their fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
growth, as our Ancestors and all the
nations of <hi>Europe</hi> have done by prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:65458:24"/>
new foundations of Religious hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
and the alienation of Lands to the
Church, without special License; As we
shall see hereafter. And if the excesse be
so exorbitant, that it is absolutely and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
destructive to the constitution of
the common wealth, it is lawfull (upon some
conditions and cautions not necessary to
be here inserted) to prune the superfluous
branches and to reduce them to a right
temper and <hi>aequilibrium,</hi> for the preservation
and well-being of the whole body Politick.
It hath been alwayes held lawful in some
cases to alienate some things, that had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
been given to the Church, as for the
redemption of Christian Captives, for the
sustenance of poor Christians, who are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Temples, in the daies of famine, and for
preservation of the Church it self from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molition;
But Eradication, to pluck up
good institutions root and branch, is not
reformation which we professe, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.</p>
               <p>To conclude this digression. So as Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries
were moderated in their number,
and in their revenues; So as the Monks
were restrained from medling between the
Pastor and his flock, that is the Bark and
the Tree, as it was of old, <hi>Monachus in
oppido, Piscis in arido,</hi> a Monk in a great town
was thought like a little fish upon dry land.
So as the abler sort, who are not taken up
with higher studies or weightier imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:65458:25"/>
were inured to bestow their spare
howers from their devotions in some profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
labour for the publick good, that idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
might be stripped of the cloak of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative
devotion. So as the vow of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall
coelibate were reduced to the forme
of our English Vniversities, so long a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
so long unmarried, or of the Canonesses
&amp; Biggins, on the other side the Seas,
which are no longer restrained from wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock
then they retain their places or habits;
So as their blind obedience were more
inlightened, and secured by some certain
rules and bounds. So as their mock pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
(for what is it else to professe want and
swim in abundance,) were changed into a
competent maintenance; And lastly, So as
all opinion of satisfaction and supereroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
were removed, I do not see why mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
might not agree well enough with
reformed devotion.</p>
               <p>So then <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth at the time of
his secession from <hi>Rome,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Henry the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. no friend to Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 31. Hen. 8.</note> and long after, even
so long as he lived, was neither friend nor
favourer of the ensuing reformation, nor
ordinarily of Protestants in their persons.
As may yet more manifestly appear by that
cruel statute of the Six Articles; which he
made after all this in the one and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth
year of his raign as a trap to catch
the Lives of the poore Protestants. A
Law both writ in blood, and executed in
blood.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:65458:25"/>
But suppose that <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth had
been a friend to Protestants,<note place="margin">Much lesse those who joyned with him in the separation from Rome.</note> what shall we
say to all the Orders of the Kingdom? what
shall we say to the Synods, to the Universi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,

that it scarce deserveth an Answer. Admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,

<hi>Henry</hi> the eighth had been our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former,
as he was not, yet all this would
signifie nothing as to this present question.
God doth often good works by ill agents.
<hi>Iehu's heart was not upright towards the Lord,</hi>
yet God used him as an Instrument to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
his Church, and to punish the worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
of <hi>Baal.</hi> We have heard of late of an
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:65458:27"/>
aggregative treason, not known before in
the world, But never untill now of an aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
Schisme. The addition of twenty
sins of another nature cannot make that to
be Schisme which is not Schisme in it self.
We are sorry for his sins under a condition,
that is, in case they were true, which for
part of them we have no great Reason to
believe; But we are absolutely without
condition glad of our own liberty. The
truth is, God Almighty did serve himself of
a most unlawful dispensation granted by the
Pope to King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, to marry
his brothers Wife, as an occasion of this
great work.<note place="margin">Holins. in Hen. 8. p. 923. Hall. 22. H. 8. p. 199.</note> I say unlawful, because it was
after judged unlawful by the Universities of
<hi>England, France, Italy,</hi> after mature delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and some of them upon oath, and by
above an hundred forrein Doctours of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
reputation for learning. The coales of
the Kings suspicion were kindled in <hi>Spain,
France,</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> no enemies to the
Pope, and blown by Cardinal <hi>Wolsey</hi> for
sinister ends; But it was <hi>Cranmer</hi> that struck
the nail home. And God disposed all things
to his own glory.</p>
               <p>To their third exception, That to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
obedience is Schismatical as well as to
withdraw it. I answer first, that they cannot
accuse us as accessaries to Schisme, until they
have first condemned their own great Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons,
Champions and Confessours for the
principal Schismaticks. Did Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:65458:27"/>
themselves find right and sufficient
reason to turn the Pope out of <hi>England</hi> at
the foredoor, in fair daylight, as an intruder
and usurper? And do they expect that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
who never had any relation to him,
should let him in again by stealth at the
back-door?</p>
               <q>Turpius ejicitur quam non admittitur hospes.</q>
               <p>It is true, Queen <hi>Mary</hi> afterwards gave
him houseroom again in <hi>England</hi> for a short
time. But he raged so extreamly, and made
such bonefires of poor innocent Christians
in every corner of the Kingdome, that it is
no marvail if they desired his room rather
then his company.</p>
               <p>I have often wondred how any rational
man could satisfie himself so as to make the
severity of our Lawes,<note place="margin">Our Lawes are not cruel against Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks.</note> or the rigour of our
Princes since the reformation, a motive to
his revolt from our Church. Surely the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition
was quite out of his mind; but I
meddle not with forrein affaires. He might
have considered, that more Protestants suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
death in the short Raign of Queen
<hi>Mary,</hi> Men, Women, and Children, then
Roman Catholicks in all the longer Raignes
of all our Princes since the Reformation put
together. The former by fire and faggot, a
cruel lingring torment, <hi>ut sentirent se mori,</hi>
that they might feel themselves to die by
degrees. The other by the gibbet, with
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:65458:28"/>
some opprobious circumstances, to render
their sufferings more exemplary to others.
The former meerly and immediately for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
because they would not be Roman
Catholicks, without any the least praetext of
the violation of any political Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The
latter not meerly and immediately for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
because they were Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,
for many known <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks in
England have lived and dyed in greater
plenty, and power, and reputation in every
princes raign, since the Reformation, then
an English Protestant could live among the
Irish Roman Catholicks, since their insur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.
If a subject was taken at Masse it
self in England, which was very rare, it was
but a pecuniary mulct. No stranger was
ever questioned about his religion. I may
not here omit King <hi>Iames</hi> his affirmation,<note place="margin">Apol. P. 153:</note>
That no man in his Raign, or in the Raign
of his predecessor Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> did
suffer death for conscience sake or Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
               <p>But they suffered for the violation of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Lawes, as either for not acknowledging
the political Supremacy of the King in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
causes over Ecclesiastical per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
which is all that we assert; which the
Roman Catholicks themselves in <hi>Henry</hi> the
Eighth's daies did maintain as much, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
more then we. We want not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of their own Schooles, or the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
practise of Kings and Parliaments of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:65458:28"/>
their own communion,<note place="margin">In Artic. 37. p. 419, 420, &amp;c.</note> As <hi>Sancta Clara</hi>

and the preservation of publick Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice

Ecclesiastical persons in Ecclesiastical cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
in many cases; <hi>As they may command
Bishops to dispose their spiritual affaires to the
peace of the Common-wealth, They may remove
the froward from their offices, They may defend
the oppressed Clergy from the unjust oppressions
of Ecclesiastical Iudges,</hi> &amp;c. which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth
to be as much as our Article setteth
forth. What the practise of other Kings
and Princes is herein, we shall see more fully
when I come to handle my fifth Proposition;
Or else for returning into the Kingdome so
qualified with forbidden orders, as the
Lawes of the Land do not allow. The State
of <hi>Venice</hi> doth not, the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi>
hath not abhorred from the like Lawes. Or
lastly, for attempting to seduce some of the
Kings Subjects from the Religion establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Land. In all these cases besides
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:65458:29"/>
religion, there is something of Election;
<hi>He that loves Danger doth often perish in it.</hi>
The truth is this, An hard Knott must have
an heavy Mall; Dangerous and bloody po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
and practises produce severe lawes.
No Kingdom is destitute of necessary reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
for its own conservation; If all were
of my mind, as I believe many are, I could
wish that all Seditious Opinions, and over
rigorous statutes, with the memory of them,
were buried together in perpetual oblivion.
I hold him scarce a good Christian that
would not cast on one spade full of earth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
their interrement; Pardon this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression,
if it be one, Cruelty is a Symptome
of Schisme.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Though the first se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paraters were Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, we are free.</note> I answer that though the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manists
could be contented to brand their
own friends for the principall Schismaticks,
yet they shall never be able to prove us
accessaries, or fasten the same Crime upon
us, who found the separation made to our
hands, who never had any thing to do with
<hi>Rome,</hi> who never ought them any Service
but the reciprocall duty of love, who never
did any act to oblige us to them, or to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblige
us from them; indeed it were some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
if they could produce a patent from
Heaven of the Popes Vicariate Generall
under Christ over all Christians; (But that
we know they can never do) Or but so much
as an old Canon of a generall Councel that
did subject us to their Jurisdiction, So as
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:65458:29"/>
the same were neither lawfully revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
nor their power forfeited by abuse,
nor quitted by themselves, untill then
they may withdraw their charge of
Schisme.</p>
               <p>Nay yet more, though they could justifie
their pretended title, yet we acting nothing,
but preserving all things in the same condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
we found them, are not censurable as
formal Schismaticks, whilest we erre invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly,
or but probably, and are implicitely
prepared in our minds, to obey all our just
Superiours, so far as by law we are bound,
whensoever we shall be able to understand
their right.</p>
               <p>There have been many Schismes in
the Roman Church it self. Sometimes
two Popes, sometimes three Popes at a
time. One Kingdome s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>bmitted to one,
this to another, that to a third, every one
believing him to whom he submitted to be
the right Pope, and every one ready to have
submitted to the right Pope, if they had
known who he was. Tell me, were all
those that submitted to Antipopes present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Schismaticks? That were too hard a
censure. The Antipopes themselves were
the Schismaticks, and the Cardinals that
Elected them, and all these who supported
them for avaritious, or ambitious or uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
ends.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We may apply to this purpose that which

inquire carefully after the truth, and be ready

               <p>If this be true in the case of Heresie, it holds
much more strongly in the case of Schism, &amp;
especially that Schism which is grounded on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon Humane constitutions. He that diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beys
a Lawful Superiour through invincible
ignorance, whom he deserted not himself,
but found him cast off by his parents, if he be
careful to understand his duty, and ready to
submit so far as in justice he is bound, he
is not to be reputed a Schismatick. If men
might not be saved by a general and impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite

by general and implicite repentance, why not

do their uttermost indeavours to learn
their duties, and are ready to conform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:65458:30"/>
when they know them. God looks
upon his creatures with all their prejudices,
and expects no more of them then accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the talents which he hath given
them. If I had books for that purpose, I
might have cited, many Lawes and many
Authors to prove that the final separation
from <hi>Rome</hi> was made long before the
reformation of the Church of England. But
it is a truth so evident and so undeniable by
all these who understand our affaires, that
I seem to my self to have done overmuch in
it already.</p>
               <p>I do expect that it should be urged by
some that there was a double separation of
the Church of England from <hi>Rome;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Protestants no authors of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from the Church of Rome.</note> The
former from the court of <hi>Rome;</hi> The second
from the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> The former in
point of discipline; The latter in point of
Doctrine; The former made in the daies
of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth; The other in the daies
of <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth. That if the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
were not guilty of the former, yet
certainly they were guilty of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>To this I give two answers: first that the
second separation in point of Doctrine
doth not concern this question, <hi>Whether the
Church of England be Schismatical,</hi> but ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>whether the Church of England be Haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall,</hi>
or at least <hi>Heterodox,</hi> (for every error
doth not presently make an haeresy) which
cannot be determined without discussing
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:65458:31"/>
the particular differences between the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
It is an undeniable principle to which both
parties do yeeld firm assent,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Knot Inf. num. p. 534.</note> 
                  <hi>that they who
made the first separation from the primitive pure
Church, and brought in corruptions in faith, Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy,
or use of the Sacraments,</hi> are the guilty
party. Yea though the separation were
not local but onely moral, by introducing
errours and innovations, and making no
other secession: This is the issue of our
controversie. If they have innovated first,
then we are innocent, and have done no
more then our duties. It is not the separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but the cause that makes a Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique.</p>
               <p>Secondly I answer, that as Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
(not Protestants) were the authors of
the Separation of <hi>England</hi> from the Court of
<hi>Rome,</hi> so the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> it self (not Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants)
made the Separation of <hi>England</hi> from
the communion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> by
their unjust and tyrannical censures, excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications,
and interdictions, which they
thundred out against the Realm, for denying
their spiritual Soveraignty by divine right,
before any reformation made by Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants.
It was not Protestants that left the
communion of the Church of Rome, but the
Court of Rome that thrust all the English
Nation both Protestants and Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks
together out of their doores, and
chased them away from them, when Pope
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:65458:31"/>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> the third excommunicated and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
England,<note place="margin">Bulla Pauli 3. apud Sander. de Schism. l. 1. p. 109.</note> in the daies of <hi>Henry</hi> the
eighth, before ever any reformation was
attempted by the Protestants. In that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
the Protestants found the Church and
Kingdom of England in the daies of <hi>Edward</hi>
the sixth. So there was no need of any new
separation from the communion of the
Church of Rome, The Court of Rome had
done <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hat to their hands. So to conclude
my first Proposition, Whatsoever some not
knowing or not weighing the state of our
affaires; And the Acts and Records of those
times have rashly or ignorantly pronounced
to the contrary, it is evident that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
had no hand either in the separation

               <p>THe second Conclusion upon exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination

the former, that <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth
and those Roman Catholicks with

what their predecessors in all ages had done
before them, treading in the steps of their

of the Apostolical Churches, as

in all their differences did look upon
the Bishops of those Sees as honourable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrators,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:65458:32"/>
and faithful Depositaries of the
genuine Apostolical traditions, especially
wherein they accorded one with another.
Hence is that of <hi>Tertullian,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

And in this sense and no other Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi>

matter and words of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> whom he
honoured with the title of <hi>his Master,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">L. 4. Epis. 8.</note> doth
call the Church of Rome <hi>a Matrix and a

the observation of <hi>Easter,</hi> between <hi>Victor</hi>
Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Polycrates</hi> Bishop of
<hi>Ephes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and S. <hi>Paul.</hi> the other from S. <hi>Iohn.</hi> The
respective Churches did conform themselves
to their Superiours, or if they were free, (as
the <hi>Britannique</hi> Churches were) to their
own judgment, or to the example of their
neighbour Churches, or kept them to the
tradition delivered unto them by their first
converters. As in this very controversie
about <hi>Easter,</hi> and some baptismal rites, the
<hi>Brittish</hi> and <hi>Scottish</hi> Bishops alwaies adhered
to the Eastern Church. A strong presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that thence they received the faith, and
were not subordinate to the Patriarchal See
of <hi>Rome.</hi> But yet all this honourable respect
proceeded from a free prudential compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
without any perpetual or necessary
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:65458:33"/>
subjection. Afterwards some Churches lost,
some gained the place and dignity of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical
Churches, either by custome, so
<hi>Ephesus</hi> lost it; or by the Canons of the
Fathers, so <hi>Constantinople</hi> did get it: or
lastly,<note place="margin">Novel. 131. c. 3. et 4.</note> by Imperial priviledges, so <hi>Iustiniana</hi> and <hi>Carthage</hi> obtained it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is not to be doubted of, but
that after the year six hundred,<note place="margin">It is no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel that the Pope win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded himself into En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.</note> after that
Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> had quitted his Patriarchal
dignity, by assuming a more lofty title of
universal Bishop, The succeeding Popes by
the connivence, leave or consent of our
Kings, did sometimes more, sometimes lesse,
upon pretence of their universal Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
by degrees thrust in their sickle into the

all occasions and occurrences to the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage

authority; whosoever shall weigh seriously
with what art and cunning the Papacy (as it
now is) was tacked into the Church contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

and universality of power; who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
shall duly consider what advantage

did watch their times when we had Princes

wind themselves into <hi>Britain.</hi> Nay rather

effected, but for their exorbitant rapines,

               <p>But first this intrusion was manifest usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation

(for at first of Seven Kings there was but

that any of the succeeding Kings of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
or of great Brittain united, did ever
make any Solemne, formal or obliging ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment
of their submission to the
Bishop of Rome.</p>
               <p>But on the contrary,<note place="margin">Bed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

So not onely their Jurisdiction: but even
the exercise of their pastorall function
within that Realm, was by the Kings leave
and Authority. The donation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation
of King <hi>Iohn</hi> whereby he went
about to make a free Kingdom servile and
feudatary to the Pope, did concern the
Crown more then the Miter, and was
soon hissed out of the world to the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
shame and infamy of such mercenary
Pastors; yet to obtain this Ludibrious act
the power of the Keyes was abused, and
the Kingdom of England stood inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
by the space of six years and three
Months.<note place="margin">The Popes. p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>The Popes in later times had some power
in England, of courtesy, not of Duty, but
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:65458:34"/>
never that omnipotence which they gaped
after. Sometimes they sent their Nuncios or
Legates into England. So they did of old
into other Patriarchates. Sometimes they
admitted appeales from England to Rome.
So they did of old from <hi>Africk.</hi> Sometimes
they excommunicated the English Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.
So did Pope <hi>Victor</hi> long since ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate
all the <hi>Asiaticks.</hi> But neither
<hi>Asia</hi> nor <hi>Africk</hi> for all that did acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the Popes Jurisdiction. On the other
side, sometimes their Legates were not
permitted to enter into the Realm, or after
their arrival thrust out of the Realm, unless
they wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ld give caution by oath for their
good demesnour. Sometimes their Bulls
and excommunications were slighted or
damned, and they who procured them
soundly punished for their labours. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
all appeales to <hi>Rome</hi> were prohibited
under most severe penalties, and their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
rejected. All this while our Kings
and Bishops called Councells, the one
under civil punishments, the other under
Ecclesiastical, made Ecclesiastical lawes and
constitutions in their Synods and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
yea expresse constitutions against
the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> it self with as much
tartnesse and vehemency as King <hi>Henry</hi>
the Eighth. And with this onely difference
that they indeavoured to draw the people
out of the Popes clawes at home, and he
thought it more expedient to throw the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:65458:35"/>
Pope over the <hi>Brittish</hi> Sea, once for altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
The old and lawful Patriarchal power
of the Roman Bishops within their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stricts,
had been renounced long before by
themselves. Their new universal Monarchy,
erected by themselves, was not capable of
prescription; or if it had, yet such a dubious
unquiet possession as the Popes did hold in
<hi>England</hi> at the mercy and discretion of the
right owners, was not sufficient to make a
legal prescription, or to justifie their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
title, or to render them <hi>bonae fidei pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessores,</hi>
lawful and conscionable possessours.
This is that which I am now to demonstrate
in this second ground.</p>
               <p>The most famous (I had almost said the
onely) appellant from <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> that
we read of before the Conquest was <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fride</hi>
Arch-Bishop of <hi>York,</hi>

that the Pope did send expresse
Nuncios into England, on purpose to see his
sentence executed, yet he could not obtain
his restitution or the benefit of his sentence
for six years, during the Raignes of King
<hi>Egbert</hi> and <hi>Alfrede</hi> his son. Yea King <hi>Alfrede</hi>
told the Popes Nuncios expresly, <hi>That he
honoured them as his Parents for their grave
lives and honourable aspects,</hi>

                  <hi>but he could not
give any assent to their Legation; Because it was
against reason, that a person twice condemned
by the whole Councel of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> English, should be
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:65458:35"/>
restored upon the Popes Letter.</hi> If they had
believed the Pope to be their competent
Judge, either as universal Monarch, or so
much as Patriarch of <hi>Brittaine,</hi> or any more
then an honourable Arbitrator, (which all
the Patriarchs were even without the bounds
of their proper Jurisdictions) how comes it
to passe that two Kings successively, and the
great Councels of the Kingdome, and the
other Arch-Bishop <hi>Theodore</hi> with all the
prime Ecclesiasticks, and the flower of the
English Clergy, did so long and so resolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
oppose so many Sentences and Messages
from <hi>Rome,</hi> and condemn him twice, whom
the Pope had absolved? Consider that
<hi>Wilfride</hi> was an Arch-Bishop, not an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Clerk; And if an appeal from <hi>England</hi>
to <hi>Rome</hi> had been proper or lawful in any
case, it had been so in his case. But it was
otherwise determined by those who were
most concerned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Malmesbury</hi> supposeth either by inspirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or upon his own head, that the King and
the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Arch-Bishop <hi>Theodore</hi> were smitten
with remorse before their deaths, for the
injury done to <hi>Wilfride</hi> and the slighting of
the Popes Sentence, Letter and Legates.
But the contrary is mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> apparently true;
for first, it was not King <hi>Alfrede</hi> alone, but
the great Councel of the Kingdom also;
nor <hi>Theodore</hi> alone, but the main body
of the Clergy, that opposed the Popes
Letter, and the restitution of <hi>Wilfride,</hi> in
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:65458:36"/>
that manner as it was decreed at <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, after <hi>Alfrede and Theodoret</hi> were
both dead, we find the Popes sentence and
<hi>Wilfrides</hi> restitution still opposed by the
surviving Bishops, in the Raign of <hi>Alfredes</hi>
son. To clear the matter past contradiction,
let us consider the ground of this long and
bitter contention; <hi>Wilfride</hi> the Archbishop
was become a great pluralist, and had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grossed
into his hands too many Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
dignities. The King and the Church of
<hi>England</hi> thought fit to deprive him of some
of them, and to confer them upon others.
<hi>Wilfride</hi> appealed from their sentence unto
<hi>Rome.</hi> The Pope gave sentence after sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
in favour of <hi>Wilfride.</hi> But for all his
sentences he was not, he could not be resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
untill he had quitted two of his Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries,
which were in question, <hi>Hongesthill
deane,</hi> and <hi>Ripon,</hi> which of all others he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
most dearly, and where he was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
interred. This was not a conquest,
but a plain waving of his sentences from
<hi>Rome,</hi> and a yeelding of the question; for
those had been the chief causes of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie.
So the King and the Church af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Alfredes</hi> death still made good his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
That it was against reason, that a
person twice condemned by the whole
Councel of the English, should be restored
upon the Popes Bull. And as he did not,
so neither did they give any assent to the
Popes Legation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:65458:36"/>
So unfortunate were appeales to <hi>Rome</hi> in
those daies: And as unfrequent as unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate;
for from that time untill <hi>Anselmes</hi>
daies after the <hi>Norman</hi> Conquest in the
Raign of <hi>Henry</hi> the first, we do hardly meet
with another appeal. Then Pope <hi>Paschalis</hi>

But the best was, that though <hi>Anselme</hi>
the Archbishop was obliged by oath to the
Pope, yet the Bishops were not so soon
brought into the same bondage. And
therefore the former Authour tells us, that
<hi>In his exequendis omnes Episcopi Angliae Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mati

                  <note place="margin">Malm. ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>In the execution
of these things, all the Bishops of England did
deny their suffrage to their Primate.</hi> So una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous
were they in this point.</p>
               <p>Which unanimity of the whole Realm
both Clergy and Laity doth appear yet
more evidently by the Statute of <hi>Clarendon,</hi>
made in the Raign of the grand-child of this
King, when all the Prelates and Peeres of

<hi>Brittish English</hi> custome,<note place="margin">Math. Par. an. 1164.</note> not onely by their
consents, but by their oathes, whereof we
shall have occasion to speak more hereafter.
And upon this custome was that Law
grounded, which our Histories do make
mention of, <hi>Si quis inventus fuerit literas vel

Such a thing as a Legantine Court, or a
Nuncios Court, was not known in the Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish
world in those ages, and long after. It
is not enough to shew that one Roman Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
did once send over one or two Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
to help to propagate or confirm the
faith, or to lend their helping hands to
Religion fainting.</p>
               <p>This may well set forth their devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and our obligation. But further
as to the present question it signifies just
nothing.</p>
               <p>Favours cease to be favours, when they
are done on purpose to deprive men of
their ancient liberties. The Brittish Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
and English also, have done as much
for other Nations, over whom they did
never challenge any Jurisdiction. The
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:65458:38"/>
French Church sent over <hi>Germanus &amp; Lupus</hi>
to help to root up the relicks of Pelagia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme

St. <hi>Gregory</hi> to the conquest, it was usual for
the Brittish, Saxon, and Danish Kings, with

Ecclesiastical lawes, and to regulate the

their Dominions: Witnesse the lawes of
<hi>Ercombert, Ina, Withred, Alfrede, Edward,

                  <hi>to take cognisance of wrong

Holy King <hi>Edward</hi> the Confessor, that Pope
<hi>Nicholas</hi> the second by his bull for him and
his Successours, granted this ensuing privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
to the Kings of England for ever;
Namely, the <hi>Advocation and protection of

                  <hi>and power in

with the advise of their Bishops and Abbats.</hi>
This grant is as full or fuller then that
which <hi>Vrban</hi> the second made to <hi>Roger</hi>
Earl of <hi>Sicily,</hi> from whence the Kings of
Spain at this day do not onely Challenge,
but enjoy in a manner all Ecclesiastical

power in <hi>Sicily.</hi> If the Pope had ever had
any such right as he pretends, this onely
Bull were sufficient to justifie our Kings.
But they injoyed this very power from the
beginning, as an essential flower of their
Crownes, without any thanks to the Pope.
<hi>To make just Ecclesiasticall constitutions in the
Popes stead,</hi> saith the Bull. <hi>To govern the
Church as the Vicar of God,</hi> saith the law of
the Land.</p>
               <p>The Bishops of Rome have ever been
very kind,<note place="margin">An old Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice of the Roman Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops.</note> in granting those things which
were none of their own, and in making
deputations and delegations to them who
stood in no need of their help, being law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
invested before hand by another title,
in that power and dignity, which the Popes
pretended out of their goodnesse to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
upon them, but in truth, did it onely for
the reputation of their See, and for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the opinion of their own Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur.
Whether the deputation were accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or not, they did not much trouble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
So they dealt with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

Hence all those Statutes concerning

in Mortmain, prohibitions, consultations,

our Kings by two Statutes or Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament

The Pope could not translate an Arch Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprick
or a Bishoprick, but the King. The
disposition of Ecclesiastical preferments
upon lapse accrued not to the Pope but to
the King; a plain evidence that he was the
Lord Paramount. And the King onely
could incurre no lapse, <hi>Nullum tempus oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currit
Regi;</hi> because the law supposed that
he was busied about the weightie affaires
of the Kingdom. The revenewes of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprick
in the vacancy belonged not unto
the Pope; but to the King, which he caused
to be restored, sometimes from the time
of the first vacancy, sometimes from the
time of the filling of the Church with a
new Incumbent according to his good
pleasure.</p>
               <p>The Canons of the Pope could not
change the Ecclesiastical Lawes of England<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but the King,<note place="margin">Canon law of no more force in England then as it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</note> whose lawes they were. He
had power in his great Councel to receive
the canons if they were judged convenient,
or to reject them, and abrogate them, if
they were judged inconvenient. When
some Bishops proposed in Parliament the
reception of the Ecclesiastical Canon for
the Legitimation of Children born before
marriage (without such a reception the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:65458:40"/>
Canon was of no force in England) All the
Peers of the Realm stood up and cryed
out with one voice, <hi>Nolumus leges Angliae

to be changed.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">20. H. 3. c. 9. 4. E. 1. c. 5.</note> The King and Parliament

right Pope in a time of Schisme,<note place="margin">2. R. 2. c. 6.</note> that is, in
relation to England, their own Kingdom,
not by determining the titles of the Popes,
but by applying the matter to the one, and
substracting it from the other. All these
are so many evidences, that when Popery
was at the highest, the Bishops of Rome
had no such absolute Ecclesiasticall Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty
in the Church and Realm of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.
And that what power they exercised
at any time more then this, was by conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence,
or permission, or violent usurpation.
And that our Primates had no forraign
Superiour Legally established over them,
but onely the King as he was the Supream
head of the whole body politick.<note place="margin">Aedmer. in initio.</note> To see
that every one did his duty, and injoyed

his due right. Who would not suffer one

from Rome, without his privity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</p>
               <p>No Legate <hi>de latere</hi> was allowed by the

                     <desc>•</desc>

against it upon mistaken grounds. That
the English protestants had made a Law
<hi>to maintain and patronize Sacriledge, that no
man (how penitent soever) could restore any
thing to the Church, which had been formerly
taken from it.</hi> God forbid. First the sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
of <hi>Mortmain</hi> were not made by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:65458:41"/>
but in the daies of <hi>Henry</hi> the third,
<hi>Edward</hi> the first, and <hi>Richard</hi> the second,
between the last of which, and <hi>Henry</hi> the
eighth, there raigned six Kings successively.
That is one great mistake. Secondly, the
Statutes of Mortmain did not at all concern
the restitution of any thing that had been
taken away. There was no use for that in
those daies. The onely scope of those
Lawes was to restrain the first donation of
Lands to the Church without royal assent,
That is another mistake. Thirdly, these
very Lawes of Mortmain are not so incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible,
nor so hard to be believed, nor so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
destitute of presidents and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
as that authour doth imagine, so as
<hi>posterity should scarcely believe that ever any
such Law had been made.</hi>

               <p>He might have remembred the Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

that the troubles between the Pope and the

Law.</p>
               <p>Briefly, with a little search he might have

cannot wrong his Subject that is an owner

be in the power of a Subject that is an

But by such alienations of Lands to

               </p>
               <p>To prevent this great inconvenience, the
Lawes of Mortmain were devised prudently,
to ballance the spiritualty and the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty,
that the one do not swallow up the
other, to which all wise Legislators have
ever had, &amp; ought to have a special regard.</p>

Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> The King called
a general Assembly of his Archbishops,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:65458:42"/>
Bishops, Abbats, Priors, and Peers of the
Realm, at <hi>Clarendon,</hi> where there was made
an acknowledgment or memorial, <hi>cujusdam
partis consuetudinum &amp; libertatum Antecesso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
suorum, Regis videlicet Henrici avi sui,
&amp; aliorum, quaeobservari debebant in Regno,
&amp; ab omnibus teneri, of a certain part of the
Customes and Liberties of his predecessors, that
is to say, his Grand-father Henry the first son of
the Conquerour, and other Kings. (A parte)</hi> but
<hi>ex ungue Leonem;</hi> from the view of this part
we may conclude of what nature the rest
were <hi>(of the customes).</hi> The customes of
<hi>England</hi> are the Common Law of the Land.
<hi>(of his predecessors)</hi> that is to say, the <hi>Saxon,
Danish,</hi> and <hi>Norman</hi> Kings successively. And
therefore no marveil if they ought <hi>to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
of all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This part of their ancient customes or
liberties they reduced into sixteen Chapters
or Articles, To which all the Archbishops,
Bishops and other Ecclesiasticks, with all
the Peeres and Nobles of the Realm did not
onely give their acknowledgment, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
but also their oathes, for the due obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of them. It would be tedious and
impertinent to relate them all, I will onely
cull out some of them. One was, that <hi>all
appeales in England must proceed regularly from
the Arch-Deacon to the Bishop, from the Bishop
to the Archbishop, and if the Archbishop failed
to do justice, the last complaint must be to the
King, to give order for redresse,</hi> that is, by fit
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:65458:43"/>
Delegates. But there might be no further
or other Appeales without the consent of
the King: whereby the Nunciature<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, and
Legantine Court, and the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> it
self are all at the Kings mercy. Wherein
did the Popes great strength lie in those
dayes? when his hands were fast tied both
at home and abroad.</p>
               <p>Another Custome was, that <hi>no Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
person might depart out of the Kingdome
without the Kings License</hi> (no not though he
were summoned by the Bishop of <hi>Rome.)</hi>
And if the King permitted them to go, yet
<hi>if he required it, they must give caution or secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to act nothing hurtful or prejudicial to the
King or Kingdome, in their going thither, abiding
there, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d returning home.</hi> You see our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors
were jealous of <hi>Rome</hi> in those daies.
Whether it was their providence or their
experience that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aught them this lesson, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
their prudence to prevent dangers
was very commendable.</p>
               <p>A third custome was, that <hi>the revenues of
all Ecclesiastical dignities</hi> belonging to the
Kings demeisne, during the vacancy, were
to be received by the King, as freely as the
rents of his own demeisnes. Tell me, who
was then the Patron and Political Head of
the Church?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A fourth Custome was,</hi> that <hi>when an Arch-Bishoprick,
Bishoprick, Abbacy or Priory did fall
void, the election was to be made by such of the
principal dignitaries or members of that respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:65458:43"/>
Church which was to be filled, as the
King should call together for that purpose, with
the Kings consent, in the Kings own Chappell.
And there the person elected was to do his homage
and fealty to the King, as to his Liege Lord.</hi>
That later form of, <hi>Dei &amp; Apostolicae sedis
gratia,</hi> had taken no root in <hi>England</hi> in those
daies.</p>
               <p>The rest are of the same nature, as that
Controversies concerning Advowsons
ought to be determined in the Kings Court.
Benefices belonging to the Kings patronage
could not be appropriated without his
grant.</p>
               <p>When a Clergy man was accused of
any Delinquency, the Kings Court ought
to determine what part of his accusation
was of Civil, and what part of Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
cognisance. And the Kings Justice
might send to the Ecclesiastical Court to
see it ordered accordingly. None of the
Kings Servants or Tenants that held of him
in <hi>capite</hi> might be excommunicated, nor
their Lands interdicted, before the King was
made acquainted.</p>
               <p>When it was questioned whether a Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
were of Ecclesiastick or Lay fee, the
Kings Justice was to determine it by the
oathes of twelve men. All Ecclesiasticall
persons who held any possessions from the
King in <hi>capite,</hi> were to do suit and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
for the same as other Barons did,
and to joyn with the Kings Barons
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:65458:44"/>
in the Kings Judgments, untill it came to
sentence of death, or diminution of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
               <p>To this memorial all the Nobility and
Clergy of the English Nation did swear
firmly, in the word of truth, to keep all the
customes therein contained, and observe
them faithfully to the King and his heires
for ever. Among the rest, <hi>Thomas Becket</hi>
the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> himself was
carried along with the crowd to take this
Oath: Though shortly after he fell from
it, and admitted the Popes absolution.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By the Statute of</hi> Carlile <hi>made in the daies
of</hi> Edward <hi>the first it was declared,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">35. E. 1. Statute of Carlile.</note> 
                  <hi>That</hi>
the holy Church of England was founded in the
estate of Prelacy, within the Realm of England,
by the Kings and Peeres thereof. <hi>And that the
several incroachments of the Bishop of</hi>
Rome <hi>specified in that Act,</hi> did tend to the
annullation of the state of the Church, the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inheriting
of the King and the Peeres, and the
destruction of the Lawes and rights of the Realm,
(contra formam collationis) contrary to the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition

<hi>not by the Popes, of whose exorbitant and

were most sensible; so they wanted neither

               </p>
               <p>To corroborate this Law by former pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidents,

the <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings in all ages bestowed Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricks
without any contradiction. The
<hi>Norman</hi> Kings followed their example. No
sooner was <hi>Stigand</hi> dead, but <hi>William</hi> the
Conquerour elected <hi>Lanfrank</hi> Abbat of
Saint <hi>Stephens</hi> in <hi>Caen</hi> to be Archbishop.
<hi>William Rufus</hi> upon his death-bed elected
<hi>Anselme</hi> to be Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi>
And untill the daies of <hi>Henry</hi> the first, the
Popes never pretended any right, nor laid
any claim to the Patronage of the English
Churches.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Articles of the Clergy do prescribe
that</hi> elections be free,<note place="margin">Articuli cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri.</note> so as the Kings conge

                  <hi>And the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute

King and his heires, shall have and enjoy for the
time the collations to the Archbishopricks and
other dignities elective which be of his Advowry,
such as his progenitors had before free election
was granted. Sith the first elections were gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Kings progenitors upon a certain form
and condition, as namely, to demand License of
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:65458:45"/>
the King to choose, and after choise made, to
have his Royal assent. Which condition not being
kept, the thing ought by reason to return to its
first nature.</p>
               <p>Further by the same Statute of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
it is declaratively enacted, That <hi>it is
the right of the Crown of England,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">25. E. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>and the Law
of the Realm, that upon such mischiefs and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages
happening to the Realm,</hi> (by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments
and oppressions of the Court
of <hi>Rome</hi> mentioned in the body of that Law)
<hi>The King ought, and is bound by his oath with
the accord of his people in Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>liament, to make
remedy and Law, for the removing of such mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs.</hi>
We find at least seven or eight such
Statutes made in the Raigns of several Kings
against Papal provisions, reservations, and
collations, and the mischiefs that flowed
from thence.</p>
               <p>Let us listen to another Law, <hi>The Crown
of England hath been so free at all times,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">16. R. 2. C. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>that

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> no earthly subjection, but imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
subjected to God in all things touching
its regality, and to no other, and ought not to
be submitted to the Pope.</hi> Observe these
expressions, free at all times, free in all
things, in no earthly subjection, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
subjected to God, not to be submitted to
the Pope. And all this in Ecclesiastical af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires,
for of that nature were all the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
complained of in that Law, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by the view of the Statute it self. Then
if the Kings of <hi>England</hi> and the representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:65458:45"/>
body of the English Church do reform
themselves according to the word of God,
and the purest Patterns of the primitive
times, they owe no account to any, as of
duty, but to God alone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By the same statute it is enacted, That</hi> they
who shall procure or prosecute any popish Bulls
and excommunications (in certain cases) shall
incurre the forfeiture of their estates, or be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
or put out of the Kings protection. <hi>By
other statutes it is enacted. That</hi> whosoever
should draw any of the Kings Subjects out of
the Realm,<note place="margin">27. <hi>E.</hi> 3. c. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>(to Rome)</hi> in plea about any cause,
whereof the cognisance belongeth to the Kings
Court, or should sue in any forrain court to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat
any judgment given in the Kings court,
<hi>(That is by appealing to Rome)</hi> they should
incur the same penalties. <hi>The body of the
Kingdom would not suffer</hi> Edward <hi>the first
to be cited before the Pope.</hi> Henry <hi>the
sixth, by the Councel of</hi> Humphry <hi>Duke of</hi>
Glocester <hi>the Protector, protested against</hi>
Pope Martin <hi>and his Legate,</hi> That they
would not admit him contrary to the lawes
and liberties of the Realm,<note place="margin">Act. and. mon.</note> and dissented
from whatsoever he did.</p>
               <p>So we see plainly, that the King and
Church of England ever injoyed as great
or greater liberties then the Gallican King
and Church. And that King <hi>Henry</hi> the
eighth did no more in effect then his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors
from time to time had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him. Onely they laboured to damme
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:65458:46"/>
up the stream, and he thought it more expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
to stop up the fountain of papal
Tyranny, not by limiting the habitual Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction
of the Roman Bishop, which
was not in his power to do, but by sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracting
the matter, and restraining the
actual exercise of it within his own domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
And it is observable, that in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
heat of these contentions, the Praelates of
the Realm being present in Parliament disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed
the Popes incroachments, and offered
the King to stand with him <hi>in these and all
other cases touching his Crown and regality, as
they were bound by their allegiance.</hi> That is,
according to the law of Fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ds, according to
their homage done, and according to
the oath which they had taken at their
Investitures into their Bishopricks.</p>
               <p>Indeed, of later daies during those blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
wars between the houses of York and
<hi>Lancaster,</hi> the Popes sometimes invaded this
undoubted right of our Kings <hi>de facto,</hi> not
<hi>de jure,</hi> as was easie for them to do, And
tendered to the Bishops at their investitures
another oath of their own making, at first
modest and innocent enough, that they
should observe <hi>regulas Sanctorum Patrum,</hi>

them to be the interpreters of

and Bishops not onely of their Jurisdictions,
but also of their loyalty and allegiance to
their lawful Soveraigns, unlesse they take

dispensations, what did he in that but restore
the English Bishops to their ancient right,
and the Lawes of the Country with the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
of the Fathers to their vigour? He chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged
and assumed a political Supremacy
over Ecclesiastical persons in Ecclesiastical
causes; So did <hi>Edward</hi> the Confessour <hi>govern
the Church as the Vicar of God in his own King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi>
So did his predecessours hold their
Crowns as <hi>immediately subjected to God, not
subjected to the Pope.</hi> On the other side, the
Pope by our English Lawes could neither
reward freely, nor punish freely, neither
whom, nor where, nor when he thought fit,
but by the consent or connivence of the
State. He could neither do justice in <hi>England</hi>
by the Legates without controllment, nor
call English men to <hi>Rome</hi> without the Kings
License. Here is small appearance of a good
legal prescription, nor any pregnant signs of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:65458:48"/>
any Soveraign power and Jurisdiction, by
undoubted right, and so evident uncontro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
a title as is pretended.</p>
               <p>I might conclude this my second propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
with the testimonies of the greatest
Lawyers and Judges of our land.<note place="margin">The judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our English Lawyers.</note> Artists
ought to be credited in their own Art. That

Crown. There had needed no restitution
if there had not been some usurpation. And
who can wonder that the Court of Rome
so potent, so prudent, so vigilant and intent
to their own advantage, should have made
some progresse in their long destined pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
during the raigns of six or seven Kings
immediately succeeding one another, who
were all either of doubtful title, or meer
usurpers without any title, Such as cared not
much for the flowers of the Crown, so
they might but hold the Diademe it self
from their competitors?</p>
               <p>Therefore our Ecclesiasticall law was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Kings law, because the edge and
validity of it did proceed from authority
royal, our Ecclesiasticall Courts were sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Kings Courts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by his Judges.</p>
               <p>It is true, the habitual Jurisdiction of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
flowes from their Ordination: But
the actual exercise thereof in Publick courts,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:65458:48"/>
after a coercive manner is from the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
concessions of Soveraign Princes. In
a word, the law being meerly intended as a
remedy against usurpation, it cannot be a
new Law, but onely a Legislative declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

Apostles in their daies did either set up any
universall Monarchy in the Church, or so
much dilate the borders or bounds of any
one mans single Jurisdiction, as to subject
so great a part of the Christian World, as
the Western Patriarchate, to his obedience.
The highest that they went, if any of those
Canons which bear their names be genuine,
was to nationall or provincial Primates or
Patriarchs; for a Protarch or Primate and a
Patriarch, in the language of the ancient
Church signified one and the same thing, in
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:65458:50"/>

Churches flourished for many ages,
is the very same which we contend
for.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">How some Primates came to be more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected in the Church then others.</note> it is worthy of our inquiry,
how in processe of time some Primates did
obtain a much more eminent degree of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and a larger share in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Church then others. And of
this their adventitious <hi>Grandeur,</hi> we find
three principal fountaines. First, ancient
customes. Secondly, the Canons of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
And thirdly, the edicts of Christian
Princes.</p>
               <p>First,<note place="margin">Either by custom.</note> ancient customes. Upon this ground
the first generall Councel of <hi>Nice</hi> settled the

Antioch,<note place="margin">Con. Nic.</note> 
                  <hi>Let ancient customes prevail.</hi> And
these customes commonly proceeded either
from the memory of the Apostles, who had

from Apostolical fountaines their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:65458:51"/>
did fetch sound doctrine, and reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procally
paid to them due respect. So <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi>
proposed in the Occidental Councel

               <p>But first let us listen to the words of the
Councel;<note place="margin">Conc. Ephes. part. 1. Act. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Since common diseases do need
greater remedies, because they bring greater
damage; If it be not the ancient custome that
the Bishops of</hi> Antioch <hi>ordain in</hi> Cyprus, <hi>as
the Councel is sufficiently satisfied; The</hi> Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian
<hi>Praelates shall hold their rights untouched
and unviolated, according to the Canons of the
holy Fathers, and the ancient custome, ordaining
their own Bishops. And let the same be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in other Diocesses, and in all Provinces,
That no Bishop occupy another Province, which
formerly and from the beginning was not under
the power of him, or his predecessors. If any do
occupy another Province, or subject it by force,
let him restore it, that the Canons of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
be not sleighted, nor pride creep into the
Church under the praetext of worldly power,
lest by little and little that liberty be lost
which Christ purchased for us with his blood.
Therefore it hath pleased the Holy Synod,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:65458:52"/>
that every Province injoy its rights and customs
unviolated, which it had from the beginning.</hi>
These words from the beginning <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
are twice repeated. It is no marvel
if some addicted to the interest of Rome
have gone about by Slight of hand, but very
unsuccessefully to shuffle this Canon out
of the Acts of the Councel. If the Fathers
in that Holy and oecumenical Councel,
were so tender and sensible of <hi>pride creeping
into the Church</hi> in those daies, and of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to <hi>lose their Christian liberty</hi> in the case
of the Bishop of Antioch, who neither pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Divine right, nor universal Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
nor superiority above Councels,
what would they not have said or done in
this present case of the Bishop of Rome,
who challengeth not onely the right of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining,
but the grace of ordination, and
Soveraign Jurisdiction, not over <hi>Cyprus</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but over the whole Christian world; not
from custom, or Canons, or edicts, but from
the institution of Christ, who makes all the
validity of the decrees of those oecumenical
Councels which his Predecessours received
and reverenced as the Gospell, to depend
upon his own confirmation?</p>
               <p>To apply this home to the question.<note place="margin">Greg. L. 1. Ep. 24.</note> The
Generall Councel of <hi>Ephesus</hi> declared, that
no Bishop should occupie any Province,<note place="margin">The case of the Cyprian Bishops ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed.</note>
which before that Councell and <hi>from the
beginning,</hi> had not been under the Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
of him or his Predecessours; And
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:65458:53"/>
that if any Patriarch usurped any Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
over a free Province, <hi>he should quit it, for
so it pleased,</hi> not the Pope, but <hi>the Holy Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod,</hi>
that every province should <hi>injoy its an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
rights pure and inviolate.</hi> Now if it
shall evidently appear, that the Bishops of
Rome never exercised any manner of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction
over the Britannique Churches
from the beginning, no nor yet before the
general Councel of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> nor for six
hundred years after Christ, that is, untill
they themselves had disowned their Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archal
right, when Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the third
who entred into the Roman See about
three years after the death of <hi>Gregory</hi> the
great, obtained from <hi>Phocas</hi> an usurping
Emperour to be universal Bishop, that is
to say, an usurping Monarch over the
Church, which fell out so soon after the
arrivall of <hi>Austin</hi> in England, that there
wanted time to have settled the Roman Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchate
in Brittain, though the Brittons
had been as willing to receive it, as they
were averse from it: and if no true general
Councel since that time hath ever subjected
Brittain unto the Roman Court; Then the
case is clear, that Rome can pretend no
right over Brittain, without their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents,
nor any further, nor for any longer
time then they are pleased to oblige them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
Then the subsequent and violent
usurpations of the Roman Bishops cannot
render them <hi>Bonae fidei possessores,</hi> lawfull
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:65458:53"/>
owners, but that they are alwaies bound
to quit their incroachments, and the Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannique
Churches, and those who derive by
succession from them, are alwaies free to
vindicate and reassume their ancient rights
and priviledges.</p>
               <p>In this controversy by law the burthen
of the proof ought to rest upon them,<note place="margin">The proof in this cause ought to rest upon our adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries,</note> who

not upon us who deny it. Men are not put
to prove negatives. Let them produce their

years what Ecclesiastical Courts the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

Brittain, what causes they have removed

have excommunicated, or summoned to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
at <hi>Rome;</hi> let them shew what Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks
they have conferred in Brittain in
those daies, what British Bishops did then
intitle themselves to their Bishopricks, <hi>by

let them declare to the world how many of

London,</hi> or <hi>Caerleon,</hi> have constantly, or at
all repaired to <hi>Rome,</hi> to be ordained, or

He who is necessarily by law obliged
to have recourse to a forraign Prelate for
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:65458:54"/>
his ordination, is thereby implyed to be
inferiour or subject to his ordainer. If
they can say nothing to any of these points,
they may disclaime their Patriarchall
right in Brittain, and hold their peace for
ever.</p>
               <p>The reasons why I set <hi>York</hi> before <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
in the order of our British Patriarchs or
Primates are these; First, because I find
their names subscribed in that order in the
Councel of <hi>Arles,</hi> held in the year 314.
consisting as some say of 200. as others say
of 600. Bishops, convocated by <hi>Constantine</hi>
the great, before the first Councel of <hi>Nice,</hi>
to hear and determine the appeal of the
Donatists, from the sentence of the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
delegates, whereof <hi>Melchiades</hi> the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of Rome was one. It were a strange
sight in these daies to see a Pope turn Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
to the Emperours in a cause of Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall
cognisance. Secondly, for the same
reason that <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Constantinople</hi> in
those daies of the Roman Puissance were
dignified above all other Churches, because
they were then the seats of the Emperours.
<hi>York</hi> was then an Imperial City, the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis
of the chief Britannick Province,
called at that time <hi>maxima Caesariensis,</hi> where
<hi>Severus</hi> the Emperour died, and had his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
pile upon <hi>Severs</hi> hill, a place adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to that City, where <hi>Constantine</hi> the great
was born, <hi>in domo Regali vocata Pertenna,</hi>
in the Royal Palace, whereof some poor
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:65458:54"/>
remainders are yet to be seen, then called
<hi>Pertenna,</hi> now a small part of it called vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly
<hi>Bederna,</hi> a very easy mistake, if we
consider that the Brittish Pronounce <hi>P.</hi> for
<hi>B.</hi> and <hi>T.</hi> like <hi>D.</hi> situate near Christs Church
<hi>in Curia Regis</hi> or in the Kings Court, on the
one hand, and extending it self near to St.
<hi>Helens</hi> Church upon the walls, now demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished,
on the other hand.</p>
               <p>Although their silence alone to my former
demand, (at least of so many whom I have
seen that have written upon this Subject)
be a sufficient conviction of them, and a
sufficient vindication of us, yet for further
manifestation of the truth; Let us consider
first,<note place="margin">The Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannique Church an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cienter then the Roman.</note> that if we compare the ages and origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
of the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Britannique</hi> Churches,
we shall find that the <hi>Britannique</hi> is the

it self;<note place="margin">Gild. de e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

planted by <hi>Ioseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> in the raign

that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> came not to <hi>Rome,</hi> to lay
the foundation of that Church, untill the
second year of <hi>Claudius, secundo Claudii
anno in Italiam venit.</hi> So if we look to the
beginning,<note place="margin">Plat in vita Sancti. Petri. Bar. an. 44.</note> according to the direction of the
Councel of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> the Britannique Church
in its first original was free from the
Jurisdiction of the Bishop and Court of
Rome, where there was neither Bishop,
nor Court, nor Ecclesiastick Jurisdiction
at that day.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:65458:55"/>
Secondly,<note place="margin">The Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannique Churches sided with the Eastern against the Roman.</note> that it continued free in ensuing
ages appears evidently by that opposition
which the Church of <hi>Britain</hi> maintained
against the Church of Rome, siding with
the Eastern Churches about the question
of those times, concerning the observation
of Easter, and the administration of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme,
wherein <hi>Austine</hi> about the six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth
year laboured to conform them, but
in vain. Is it credible that the whole Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish
and Scottish Church should so unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously
have dissented from Rome, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
hundred years together, if they had been
subject to the Jurisdiction of the Roman
Bishop, as of their lawfull Patriarch, or
that the Bishop of Rome in all that time
should never so much as question them for
it, if they had been his Subjects? Even then
when Pope <hi>Victor</hi> durst attempt to deny or
withdraw his communion from all the <hi>Asi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atick</hi>
Churches, about the same businesse.
Neither were the Brittish Churches at last
conformed to Rome by any Patriarchall
power, but by many conferences, by the
necessity of their civill affaires, and by long
tract of time, some sooner, some later. A
long tract of time indeed, when some in the
most Septentrionall parts of these Provinces
were not reduced until a little before the
late reformation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, among the principal priviledges of
patriarchall power is the right of ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.<note place="margin">British Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained at home.</note>
That all Metropolitans at least should
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:65458:55"/>
either be ordained by the Patriarch; or by
License from the Patriarch.</p>
               <p>This appears clearly in the dispute between
the Patriarch of <hi>Antioch</hi> and the <hi>Cyprian</hi>
Bishops; But where the Bishops were
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> independent upon,
not subject unto any forrain Prelate there,
they ordained at their own pleasures, needed
no License. Such were our British Primates
ordained alwaies, or ordinarily at Rome,
according to the <hi>Cyprian</hi> priviledges, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating
new Bishopricks, ordaining new Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
at their own pleasures, without gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
any account to <hi>Rome.</hi> So we read of
St. <hi>Telaus,</hi> who had been driven out of his
own Country by an Epidemical sicknesse
for a long time,<note place="margin">Reg. Land. apud Vsh. d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>prim.</note> that at his return he <hi>conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated
and ordained Bishops as he thought fit.
That he made one</hi> Hismael <hi>Bishop of</hi> St. Davids.<note place="margin">Eccl. Brit. p. 56.</note>
                  <hi>And in like manner advanced many other men
of the same order to the same degree, sending
them throughout the country, and dividing the
parishes for the best accommodation of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
and of the People.</hi> And if there were no
other proofe of our exemption but onely
the small number of the Bishops that were
ordained by all the succeeding Popes for
about the first three hundred years untill
the death of <hi>Marcellinus:</hi> It were suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to shew that the Bishops of Rome
in those daies had little or nothing
to do out of their owne Province,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:65458:56"/>
and that their jurisdiction extended no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
near so far as <hi>Britain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Peter</hi> Ordained but three in his
supposed five and twenty years, that is
<hi>Linus</hi> and <hi>Cletus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Plat.</note> 
                  <hi>ut sacerdotale Ministeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
Romano populo &amp; advenis benè sentientibus
exhiberent,</hi> and <hi>Clement,</hi> to whom he bequea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
his Episcopal Chair. <hi>Linus</hi> but
eleven, <hi>Clement</hi> but fifteen, <hi>Anacletus</hi> but
six, <hi>Evaristus</hi> but five, <hi>Alexander</hi> but five,
<hi>Sixtus</hi> but four, &amp;c. These were few
enough for their own Province, and none
to spare for <hi>Britain.</hi> In the whole term of
three hundred years there were few above
two hundred Bishops Ordained at <hi>Rome.
Italy</hi> alone may brag well near of as many
Bishops at one time, as many succeeding
<hi>Popes</hi> did ordain in all their ages. Let them
not tell us of the scarcity of Christians in
those dayes. The writings of <hi>Tertullian</hi>
and Saint <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and the Councels held
within the time limited, do evince the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
No, the first badge of their Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal
authority in <hi>Britain</hi> was sending of the
Pall, as the onely badge during the times
of the <hi>Britons</hi> and <hi>Saxons;</hi> And the first Pall
that came into <hi>Britain</hi> was after six hundred
years.</p>
               <p>But this doth yet appear much more
clearly from the answer of <hi>Dionothus</hi>
the Reverend and learned Abbot of <hi>Bangor,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer of <hi>Dionothus.</hi>
                  </note>
which according to the manner of those
times was an University or Seminary of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:65458:56"/>
Learning and piety among the <hi>Britons,</hi> and
he the well deserving Rector of it, made in
his own name, and in the name of the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons,</hi>
when they pressed him to submit to
the <hi>Romaen</hi> Bishop as his Patriarch, that <hi>he
knew no obedience due to him whom they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Pope,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Spelm. Conc. An. 601.</note> 
                  <hi>but the obedience of love; And
that under God they were to be governed by the
Bishop of</hi> Caerleon.</p>
               <p>Observe first, what strangers the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi>
were to the <hi>Papacy, That man whom you
call the Pope.</hi> Secondly, that they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
no subjection or subordination, <hi>no
obedience</hi> whatsoever due from them to
<hi>Rome,</hi> but onely the reciprocal duty of love,
that was just the same that <hi>Rome</hi> did owe
to them. Thirdly, that <hi>under God,</hi> that is
immediatly without any Forrein Prelate or
Patriarch intervening, <hi>they were to be govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Bishop of Caerleon,</hi> as their onely
Primate and Patriarch. Which priviledge
continued to the succeeding Bishops of that
See for many ages afterwards, saving that
the Archiepiscopal Chair was removed
from <hi>Caerleon</hi> to St. <hi>Davids</hi> in the Raign of
King <hi>Arthur.</hi> And lastly, observe the time
when this answer was made, after the first
six hundred years were expired. So it is a
full demonstrative convincing proof for the
whole term prefixed.</p>
               <p>But lest any man should cavil and say,<note place="margin">Confirme by two British Sy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nods.</note>
that <hi>Dionothus</hi> was but one man, and that
the body of the British Clergy might be of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:65458:57"/>
another mind; that which followes strikes
the question dead: That <hi>Austin,</hi> Saint <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gories</hi>
Legate, proposing three things to the
<hi>Britons.</hi> First that they should submit to
the <hi>Roman</hi> Bishop. Secondly, that they
should conforme to the customes of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Province about the observation of
Easter, and the administration of Baptisme.
And Lastly, that they should joyn with him
in Preaching to the <hi>Saxons:</hi> all the <hi>British</hi>
Clergy assembled themselves together,<note place="margin">Spel. eon. an. 601.</note> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
and Priests in two several Synods,
one after another,<note place="margin">Galt. mon. l. 2. c. 12.</note> to deliberate hereupon,
and after mature consideration, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
all his propositions Synodically,<note place="margin">Beda &amp; omnes alii. Resp. Greg. ad. 8. quest.</note> and
refused flatly and unanimously to have any
thing to do with him upon those terms.
Insomuch as St. <hi>Austin</hi> was necessitated to
return over the Seas, to obtain his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration,
and after his return to consecrate
the <hi>Saxon</hi> Bishops alone, without the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of any other Bishops. They refused
indeed to their own cost, twelve hundred
innocent <hi>Monks</hi> of <hi>Bangor,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Bed. l. 2. c. 2.</note> shortly after lost
their lives for it. <hi>Rome</hi> was ever builded
in blood; Howsoever these words <hi>[quam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis
Augustino prius mortuo]</hi> have since been
forged and inserted into venerable <hi>Bede,</hi> to
palliate the matter, which are wanting in
the <hi>Saxon</hi> Copy.<note place="margin">Ant. Brit p. 48.</note> The concurring Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of all our Historiographers witness<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the absolute and unanimous refusal of
the <hi>Britons</hi> to submit to <hi>Rome,</hi> and the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:65458:57"/>
of fact it self, do confirm this for an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
truth beyond all exception. So
clear a truth it is, that the British Churches
for the first three hundred years neither
ought nor paid any subjection to <hi>Rome.</hi>
Whence might well proceed that answer of
<hi>Elutherius</hi> to King <hi>Lucius</hi> (if that Epistle be
not counterfeit) when he desired him
to send over a Copy of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Lawes, That <hi>he should chuse a Law</hi> [Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical]
<hi>out of holy writ by the Councel of his

for (saith he) you are the Vicar of Christ

is conteined in the Lawes of <hi>Edward</hi> the

it is really necessary, according to the certain
and true princ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ples of Catholick Religion, doth
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:65458:59"/>
not bring any the least shadow of danger to the
Common-Wealth, though in hostility with the
Pope, or of a different communion from the
Pope.</hi> If we lived in <hi>Plato's</hi> Common-Wealth,
where every one did his duty, this
reason were of more force. Far be it from
us to imagine, that the right exercise of any
lawful power, grounded upon the certain
and true principles of Catholick Religion,
should be dangerous to any Society. But
this is not our case. What if the Bishops
and Court of <hi>Rome</hi> have swerved from those
certain and true principles of Catholick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion?
or have abused that power which
was committed to their trust by Christ, or
by his Church? Or have usurped more au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
then did belong unto them? Or
have Engrossed all Episcopal Jurisdiction
to themselves, leaving the Bishops of the
Land but Cyphers in their own Diocesses?
Or have hazarded the utter ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of the Church by their Simony,
extortion, provisions, reservations, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptions?
Or have obtruded new unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable
Oathes upon the Subjects, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with their allegiance? Or have
drained the Kingdome of its treasure by
pecuniary avaricious arts? Or have chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged
to themselves a negative voice against
the right heir of the Crown; Or authority
to depose a crowned King, and absolve his
Subjects from their Oathes and allegiance
to their Soveraignes? And have shewed
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:65458:59"/>
themselves incorrigible in all these things.
This is our case. In any one of these cases,
much more in them all conjoyned, it is not
onely lawful, but very necessary for Christian
Princes to reform such grosse abuses, and to
free themselves and their Subjects from such
a tyrannical yoke, if they can by the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a general Councel, if not of a Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial.
And it is not Schisme but Loyalty in
their Subjects to yeild obedience.</p>
               <p>The same Author proceeds,<note place="margin">P. 528.</note> That <hi>no civil
power how Soveraign soever can correct the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
articles of Christian faith,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Protestants in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation have alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Religion nor sacred rites, nor violated Charity.</note> 
                  <hi>nor pervert
the order of sacred rites received by universal
tradition as instituted by Christ, nor justifie any
thing by their Edicts which is against Christian
charity.</hi> To all this we do readily assent, and
never did presume to arrogate to our selves,
or to exercise any such power. But still this
is wide from our case. What if the Bishop
of <hi>Rome</hi> have presumed to coyn and attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
to obtrude upon us new Articles of
Faith, as he hath in his new Creed, and to
pervert the sacred rites instituted by Christ,
as in his with-holding the Cup from the
Laity? Then without doubt not we, but he
is guilty of the Schisme; Then it is lawful
to separate from him in his innovations,
without incurring the crime of Schisme.
This is laid down by the Author himself as
an evident conclusion, and we thank him for
it;<note place="margin">p. 533.</note> That <hi>it is necessary for every Christian to
acknowledge no authority under heaven, either
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:65458:60"/>
Ecclesiastical or Civil, that hath power to abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
those things that are revealed and instituted
by Christ, or to determine those things which
are opposite unto them, quod Schismatis origo
foret, which should be the original of Schisme.</hi>
But where that Author infers as a corollary
from the former Proposition,<note place="margin">p. 528.</note> That <hi>no Edict
of a Soveraign Prince can Iustifie Schisme, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
all Schisme is destructive to Christian
charity;</hi> I must crave leave with all due
respect to his person, to his learning, to his
moderation, and to his charity, to rectifie
that mistake. If by <hi>Schisme</hi> he understand
criminal Schisme, that which he saith is
most true; That were not onely to Justifie
the wicked, <hi>which is an abhomination to the
Lord,</hi> but to justifie wickednesse it self: But
every separation or Schisme taken in a large
sence is not criminal, nor at all destructive
to Christian Charity. Sometimes it is a
necessary, Christian, charitable duty. In
all the cases that I have supposed above, and
shall prove hereafter, they that make the
Separation continue Catholiques, and they
that give the cause become the Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques.</p>
               <p>But it may be urged, That this proceeds
from the merit of the cause, not from the
authority of the Soveraign Prince.</p>
               <p>I answer, It proceeds from both. Three
things are necessary to make a publique re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
lawful; Just grounds, due mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and sufficient authority. There
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:65458:60"/>
may be just grounds without sufficient au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
and sufficient authority without
just grounds; and both sufficient authority
and just grounds without due moderation.
But where these three things concur, it justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
the reformation before God and man,
and renders that separation lawful, which
otherwise were Schismatical.</p>
               <p>Lastly,<note place="margin">p. 530.</note> it is alledged, That <hi>the power of the
Soveraign Magistrate is not so absolute that
he can command any thing at his pleasure, so as
to oblige his Subjects to obedience, in things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
to the Law of nature, or the positive
Law of God.</hi> No Orthodox Christian can
doubt of this truth.<note place="margin">Augustine</note> The authority of the
inferiour ceaseth, where the Superiour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth
his pleasure to the contrary.<note place="margin">Nor swer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the Law of nature, or positive Lawes of God.</note>

with hell-fire.</hi> But this is nothing to our
case, neither the Law of Nature, nor the

to buy pardons, and indulgences, and dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations,
and Bulls, and Palls, and priviledges
at <hi>Rome,</hi> contrary to the fundamental Laws
of the Realm. <hi>Boniface</hi> the eighth by his
Bull exempted the University of <hi>Oxford</hi>
from the Jurisdiction of the Archbishop of
<hi>Canterbury,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ex Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis Turris Londinensis citat author Antiquit.</note> whereupon did grow a contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie

               </p>
               <p>But this disobedience to the decrees of

obedience,<note place="margin">In cases doubtful we may not disobey the King and the Lawes. Exod. 1. 17. 1 Sam. 22. 17.</note> it must be onely when and

Nor is the Subject obliged to sift the grounds
of his Soveraigns commands too narrowly.
It happens often, that <hi>reum facit Principem

as of right it doth belong unto them.</p>
               <p>The Romanists themselves do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that Soveraign Princes by the Law
of God and nature, not only may, but are
in justice obliged to oppose the tyranny of
Ecclesiastical Judges, and to protect and
free their subjects from their violence and
oppression. <hi>Parsons</hi> himself wondreth that
any man should deny this power to Kings
in their own kingdomes. But we are fully
satisfied and assured, that that universal
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:65458:62"/>
power which the Pope claimes by Divine
right over all Christians, and particularly
over the <hi>Britannique</hi> Churches without
their consents; And much more that Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
which <hi>de facto</hi> he did, or at least
would have exercised there, (and lesse then
which he would not go) to the destruction
of their natural and Christian liberties and
priviledges, was and is a tyrannical and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressive
yoak. If all Christians were as
well satisfied of the truth of this our assum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
as we are, this controversie were at an
end. And thus far all <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks
not interessed, nor prepossessed with preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice,
do accord fully with us, that by whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
Papal power was given, whether by
Christ, or his Apostles, or the Fathers of
the Church in succeeding ages, it was given
for edification not for destruction. And
that the <hi>Roman</hi> Court in later dayes hath
sought to impose grievous oppressive
and intolerable burthens upon their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
which it is lawful for them to
shake off, without regarding their censure,
as we shall see in the next proposition. But
because all are not so well satisfied about
the just extent of Papal authority and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
we must search a little higher.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we do both agree, that Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign

Soveraign authority over the whole body

in the case of Abbesses, which being wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
are lesse capable of any spiritual Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.
The truth is, that as all Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical
Courts, and all Ecclesiastical coer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive
jurisdiction did flow at first either from
the Bounty and goodnesse of Soveraign
Princes to the Church, or from their conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence,
or from the voluntary consent and
free submission of Christians; <hi>Volenti non
fit injuria,</hi> consent takes away errour, (I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
alwayes that jurisdiction which is
purely spiritual, and an essential part of the
power of the Keies, whereof Emperours and
Kings are not capable.) So whensoever the
Weal-publick and the common safety of
their people doth require it, for advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of publick peace and tranquillity, and
for the greater ease and convenience of the
subject in general<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> according to the Vicis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>situde

and the change of Monarchies, they may up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

what their predecessours had advisedly
granted or permitted. And alter the face
and rules of the external discipline of the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:65458:63"/>
Church, in all such things as are but of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane

impeditive of a greater good: in which
cases their subjects may with good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,

themselves to their Lawes. Otherwise King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms

the Metropolitan of <hi>Heraclea,</hi> to be the

<hi>Pontus,</hi> and <hi>Asia</hi> the lesse, and <hi>Thracia,</hi>
and some other countries, part of which
territories they substracted from the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the Roman Bishop, at least over
which the Roman Bishops challenged Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
and part from other Patriarchs.
And the reason of this alteration was the
same for which <hi>Caesarea</hi> of old was a long

old Rome it self.</p>
               <p>But lest it may be conceived, that this was
not done at all by Imperial power, but by
the authority of the Oecumenical Synods,
we may observe further, that <hi>Iustini<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

freeing it from all appeals, and all

were given by the same Emperour,
by the same Legislative authority, to the
Bishop of Carthage, notwithstanding that
the Bishops of Rome did alwayes pretend
that Carthage was under their Jurisdiction.
I deny not that <hi>Vigilius</hi> and <hi>Gregory</hi> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
Popes did make deputations to the
Bishop of <hi>Iustiniana,</hi> to supply their places.
But this was but an old Roman fineness. The
Bishops of <hi>Iustiniana</hi> needed none of their
Commissions. <hi>Iustinian</hi> the Father and
founder of the Imperial Law knew well
enough how far his Legislative power did
extend. And though the Act was notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

               <p>If the Pope had been the King of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands

they did some of his predecessours, called a

being a stranger, all that he could justly do

prerogative daily trampled upon, his
Lawes destroyed, his Subjects oppressed,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:65458:69"/>
rather then to have new Articles of faith

until time should teach them to content
themselves with moderate things, which
endure long. Or untill either a free Oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menical
Councel, or an Europaean Synod
should settle controversies, and tune the
jarring strings of the Christian world. In
the mean time we pitty their errours, pray
for their amendment, and long for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union.</p>
               <p>Now the just grounds of such subduction

by King Iohn, who confirmed the same by oath

for the Court of Rome in those daies was
grown past shame,</hi> (rubore deposito) <hi>and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
past grace. The Pope irritated with
this usage breaks out into this passionate
expression,</hi> Nonne Rex Anglorum noster est

the King of England our Vassal, or rather our
Slave?<note place="margin">Idem. an. 1253.</note> 
                  <hi>Or rather are these fit guests to be

               <p>
                  <hi>This relation of Cardinal</hi> Allen <hi>brings
to my remembrance the question of</hi> Neopto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemus
<hi>to</hi> Vlisses <hi>when he should have taught
him the Art of lying, how</hi> it was possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for one to tell a lie without blushing?
<hi>The Arch-Priest is much more ingenuous,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:65458:74"/>
affirming that the</hi> assertions touching both the
said Kings <hi>for matter of fact</hi> were untrue.
That <hi>Henry</hi> the second never made any such
accord with <hi>Alexander</hi> the third, for ought
that he could ever read in any Chronicle of
Credit. Then the oath which <hi>Henry</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
did take for himself, <hi>(not for his heires,)
was this, that he</hi> would not depart from him
or his successours,<note place="margin">Ro. Houed. Annal. fol. 303.</note> so long as they should intreat
him as a Catholick King. That the fact of
King <hi>John</hi> is of more probability, but of as little
truth, <hi>which he confirmes by the testimony
of Sir</hi> Thomas Moore <hi>a Lord Chancellour
of England, a man of Extraordinary learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
of great parts, of so good affections to
the Roman See, that he is supposed to have
died for the Popes Supremacy, and is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
by Cardinall</hi> Bellarmine <hi>to Mr.</hi>
Blackwell <hi>as a Martyr,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ep. Card. Bell. ad G. Blackw. Archpr.</note> 
                  <hi>and a guide of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
others to Martyrdom,</hi> cum ingenti An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glica
nationis gloria, <hi>certainly one who had
as much means to know the truth, both by
view of records, and otherwise, as any
man living: Thus writeth he,</hi> If he, <hi>(the
author of the beggars supplication)</hi> say as
indeed some writers say,<note place="margin">Supplic. of souls, p. 296.</note> that King <hi>John</hi> made
<hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> tributary to the Pope and
the See Apostolique, by the grant of a thousand
Markes, we dare surely say again, that it is
untrue, and that all <hi>Rome</hi> neither can shew
such a grant, nor ever could; And if they
could, it were nothing worth. For never could
any king of <hi>England</hi> give away the Realm to
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:65458:74"/>
the Pope, or make the Land tributary, though
he would.</p>
               <p>As to that of <hi>Henry</hi> the second, without
doubt the Archpriest had all the reason in
the world for him. Cardinall <hi>Allen</hi> did not
write by inspiration, and could expect no
more credit then he brought authority.
There is a vast difference between these
two, that <hi>no man shall be accounted King of
England untill he be confirmed by the Pope:</hi>
And this other, <hi>that the King in his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
would not desert the Pope, so long as he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
him like a Catholick King.</hi> The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
is most dishonourable to the Nation,
and Diametrally opposite to the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Lawes of the Land. The later we
might take our selves without offence to
God or our own consciences. But to make
our Kings their vassals aud their slaves, to
impoverish their Realm, and to commit all
those exorbitant misdemeanours against
them, which we have related in part, and
shall yet describe more fully, was neither to
intreat them like Catholick Kings, nor
like Christian Kings, nor yet like political
Kings.</p>
               <p>And for his Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi>
we do not believe that the Popes Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
or to have his name inserted into the
Calender in red letters, makes a Saint. We
do abhominate that murther as Lawlesse
and Barbarous, to sprinkle not onely the
pavements of the Church, but the very al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:65458:75"/>
with the blood of a Prelate, And we
condemn all those who had an hand in it:
But we do not believe that the cause of his

Bishops were against him in the
cause, and justified the Kings proceedings
as appeareth by two of their letters, one to

was in the dayes of <hi>Henry</hi> the first,
and <hi>Paschal</hi> the second was the first Pope
that ever exacted an oath from any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign

though I attribute much to the authority of
Sir <hi>Thomas More</hi> in that case, who would
never have been so confident unlesse he
had supposed that he had searched the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to the bottom, yet his zeal to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy
and his unwillingnesse to see such an
unworthy act proceed from that See might
perhaps mislead him:<note place="margin">Math. Paris. an. 1212.</note> for I confesse sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
authours do relate the case otherwise.
That there was a Prophesie or Prediction
made by one <hi>Peter</hi> an <hi>Hermite,</hi> that the
next day to Ascension sunday there should
be no King in England, That Pope <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi>
the third being angry with King <hi>Iohn</hi>
excommunicated him, interdicted the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
deprived him of his Crown, absolved
his subjects from their allegiance, animated
his Barons and Bishops against him, gave
away his Realm to <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>France;</hi>
sent <hi>Pandolphus</hi> as his Legate into England
to see all this executed, The King of <hi>France</hi>
provides an Army accordingly. But the
crafty Pope underhand gives his Legate se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
instructions to speak privatly with King
<hi>Iohn,</hi> And if he could make a better bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
for him, and draw him to submit to
the sentence of the Pope, he should act no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
against him, but in his favour. They
do meete, King <hi>Iohn</hi> submits, The
Pope orders him to resign his Crown
and Kingdomes to the See of Rome,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:65458:76"/>
so (they say) he did, and received them the
next day of the Popes grace as a feudatary
at the yearly rent of a thousand Marks,<note place="margin">Math. Paris. an. 1253.</note> for
the Kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> And
did homage and swear fealty to Pope In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent.</p>
               <p>But whereas the Cardinal adds upon his
own head that this was done at the special
request and procurement of the Lords and
Commons, it is an Egregious forgery and
well deserves a whetstone, for all the three
Orders of the kingdom, Bishops, Barons,
and Commons,<note place="margin">Hoops. ad. saecul. 14. c. 5.</note> did protest against it in
Parliament notwithstanding any private
contract that might be made by King <hi>Iohn;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Citat. Sanct. Clara.</note>
And that they would defend themselves by
arms from the temporal Jurisdiction of the
Pope. But the other answer of Sr. <hi>Thomas
More</hi> is most certain and beyond all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
that if either <hi>Henry</hi> the second, or
King <hi>Iohn</hi> had done any such thing, it was
not worth a rush, nor signified any thing,
but the greedinesse and prophanenesse
of these pretended vicars of Christ, who
prostituted and abused their Office, and
the power of the Keies, to serve their base
and avaritious ends, and lets the world see
how well they deserved to be thrust out of
doores. What? That <hi>no man might be
crowned, or accounted King of England, untill
he were confirmed by the Pope?</hi> By the Law
of England, <hi>Rex non moritur</hi> the King ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
dies. And doth all acts of Soveraignty
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:65458:76"/>
before his Coronation as well as after.</p>
               <p>They robbed the Nobility of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronages,
Those Churches which their
Ancestours had founded and indowed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by provisions from Rome frequently
conferred upon strangers, which could not
speak one word of English nor did ever
tread upon English ground; Insomuch,
that at one time there were so many Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
beneficed in England, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
more money yearly out of it,<note place="margin">Math. Paris. in H. 3. An. 1245.</note> then
all the revenues of the Crown, to the high
disservice of Almighty God, the great scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
of Religion, the decay of hospital<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and the utter ruine of the English
Church.</p>
               <p>But the least share of their oppressions
did not light upon the Bishops, who by
their dispensations, and reservations of
cases, and of pensions, and exemptions, and
inhibitions, and visitations, and tenths, and
first fruits, and provisions, and subsidiary
helps, were impoverished and disabled to
do the duties of their function: They take
their aime much amisse who look upon
Episcopacy as a branch of Popery, or a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the Bishop of Rome to advance his
own greatnesse. Whereas the contrary is
most certain, that the Pope is the greatest
Impugner of Bishops, and the Papacy it self
sprung from the unjust usurpation of their

all his dispensations, and reservations, and
exemptions, and Indulgences, and his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave
of Cardinalls, and the whole Court
of <hi>Rome</hi> shrink to nothing. This was clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perceived by both parties in the ventila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that famous question in the Councel
of <hi>Trent,</hi> concerning the divine right of
Bishops, proposed by the <hi>Almaines, Poloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
and <hi>Hungarians,</hi> seconded bravely by
the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> prosecuted home by the
<hi>French,</hi> owned by the Archbishop of <hi>Paris</hi>
as the doctrine of <hi>Sorbone,</hi> and onely cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by the <hi>Italian</hi> faction, to preserve the
glorie of their own country, and the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
which that nation doth reap from
the Papacy. By whose frowardnesse and
prevarication (in all probability) the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union
of the Church, and the universal
peace of this part of Christendom in
necessary Truths, was hindred at that
time.</p>
               <p>I presume the case was not so very ill in
forrain parts, but yet ill enough. Or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
St. <hi>Bernard</hi> would not have made so
bold with <hi>Eugenius,</hi>

were not evil, he would speak many more

the confusion of appeals, how they were
admitted contrary to law and right, besides
custom and order, without any distinction
of place, or manner, or time, or cause, or
person. He complaines further of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:65458:77"/>
of Abbats from their Bishops,
Bishops from their Archbishops, Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops

               </p>
               <p>Lastly, they cheated and impoverished
the people by their dispensations and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutations,
and pardons, and indulgences,
and expeditions to recover the holy Land,
and Jubilees, and pilgrimages, and <hi>agnus

So as no sort of men escaped their fingers.</p>
               <p>The third ground of their separation
from Rome was,<note place="margin">The third ground<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> because they found by
experience that such forreign Jurisdiction
so exercised was destructive to the right
ends of Ecclesiastical discipline, which is
in part to preserve publick peace and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity,
to retein subjects in due obedience,
and to oblige people to do their duties
more conscienciously. Farre be it from
any Christian to imagine that policy is
the Spring-head of Religion; There ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was yet any one Nation so unpolitick
and brutishly barbarous, but they had
some Religion or other; they who obeyed
no governors but their parents, paid reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
duties to some God; they who want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Clothes to their backs, wanted not their
sacred Ceremonies; they who were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
municipal Lawes, were subject of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to the law of conscience. But where
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:65458:78"/>
Religion hath lost its influence and vigour
by contempt, and much more where the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
of Religion is malignant; where
Policy and Religion do not support one
another, but interfere one with another,
Societies are like Castles builded in the air,
without any firm foundation, and cannot
long endure, like as that single Meteor

                     </gap>ty.</hi> So great an influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
hath Religion upon the body Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique.</p>
               <p>Wherefore our Ancestors having seen by
long and costly experience, that the tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Jurisdiction of the Roman Court instead
of peace and tranquillity did produce dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union
in the Realm, factions and animosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
between the Crown and the Miter,
intestine discord between the King and his
Barons, bad intelligence with Neighbour-Princes,
and forreign Wars. Having seen
a stranger solicited by the Pope, either to
destroy them by War, or to subdue them to
the obedience of the Roman Court. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
seen their native Country given away
as a prey to a forreign Prince <hi>Philip</hi> of
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:65458:78"/>
                  <hi>France;</hi> And the Pope well near seated in
the Royal Chair of Estate, for him and his
successours for ever, to the endlesse dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
of the English name and Nation, by
the cheating tricks of <hi>Pandolphus</hi> his Legate,
having seen English Rebels canonized at
Rome, and made Saints, it was no marvel
if they thought it high time to free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from such a chargable and dangerous
guest.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">The fourth ground.</note> besides the former bad influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of forreign Jurisdiction upon the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Politique, they found sundry other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences
that incited them to separate
from <hi>Rome:</hi> They must have been daily
subject to have had new Creeds and
new Articles of faith obtruded upon
them: They must have been daily exposed
to manifold and manifest peril of Idolatry,
and sinning against God and their own
consciences: They must have forsaken the
Communion of three parts of Christendom,
which are not Roman, to joyn with the
fourth: They must have approved the Popes
apparent rebellion against the supream Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
power, that is, a general Councel:
And their Bishops must have sworn to
maintain him in these his rebellious usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
whether they should prefer their
native and Christian liberty, or give them
up for nothing; whether they should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
their Communion with the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
Church, or with the Court of Rome;
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:65458:79"/>
whether they should desert the Pope, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve
themselves in Rebellion, Schisme, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge,
and Perjury, the choice was soon
made.</p>
               <p>Lastly, they see that the Popes had disclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
all that just power which they had by
humane right, and challenged to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
a spiritual Monarchy or Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
by divine right, whereby their sufferings
which in themselves were unsupportable,
were made also irremediable, from thence.
Wherefore they sought out a fit expedient
for themselves, being neither ignorant of
their old <hi>Britannick</hi> exemption and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the English Church, nor yet of the
weaknesse of the Roman pretences. Our
progenitors knew well enough that their
authority extended not to take away any
the least particle of divine right, if there
had been any such, Nor could they justly
be accused of violating that humane right,
which had been quitted long before; nor be
blamed rightly for denying obedience to
him from whose Jurisdiction they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted
by the Canon of an Oecumenical
Councel, and who had himself implicitely
renounced that Ecclesiastical right which
he held from the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Perhaps some may conceive a defect in
the manner of proceeding of the King and
Church of England, that they did not first
make a Remonstrance of their grievances,
and seek redresse of the Pope himself; So
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:65458:79"/>
the Councel of</hi> Towers <hi>thought it fit.</hi> Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum

                     </gap>. an. 1510. in sine.</note> &amp;c. It seemeth
good to the Councel, that in the first place mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers
be sent from the French Church to the
Pope, who may admonish him with brotherly
love and according to the Evangelical form of
correction to desist from his attempts, and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
peace and concord with the Princes; But
if he will not hear the messengers, let him be
demanded to convocate a free Councel, according
to the decrees of the holy Councel of <hi>Basile.</hi>
And this being done, and his answer received,
further provision shall be made according to
right.</p>
               <p>To this I answer first, That it had been
reasonable and just indeed, that we had made
our first addresse to the Pope, if we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
the Roman Bishop to be our lawful
Patriarch: But the same respect is not due
to an usurper. Secondly, we have seen by
frequent experience, how vain and fruitlesse
such addresses have proved from time to
to time. According to the former advise
of the Councel of <hi>Towers,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Extraict des anales d' Aqui-taine.</note> the King of
<hi>France</hi> sent Ambassadors to <hi>Rome,</hi> but the
Pope refused to hear them, or to convocate
any Councel, and before his death Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matized
<hi>Maximilian</hi> King of the Romans;
the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and
divers other Princes, Cardinals, and Bishops
deprived the Kings and Princes of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective
Realms and Principalities, the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:65458:80"/>
Bishops of their dignities and benefices, and
gave their Kingdoms and Principalities to
the first that could take them; from which
sentence they appealed to a future Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel.</p>
               <p>The most ancient arbitrary imposition
of the Popes upon the British Churches
was the Pall, an honourable and at first
innocent ensign of an Archbishop, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
of no great moment; first introduced
in the reigns of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings after the
six hundreth year of Christ; But in process
of time it became vendible, and a great
summe was exacted for it, whereof <hi>Canu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
long since complained at <hi>Rome,</hi> and had
remedy promised, as he well deserved of

               <p>
                  <hi>In the year 1245. the King, the Lords
spiritual and temporal, and the whole
Common-Wealth of</hi> England <hi>joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
unanimously in a complaint, and exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
their grievances to</hi> Rome, that the Pope
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:65458:80"/>
extorted more then his <hi>Peter</hi>-pence out of the
Kingdom contrary to law, that the Patrons of
Churches were defrauded of their rights, stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
preferred, souls endangered, their bullion ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,
the Kingdome impoverished, provisions
made, pensions exacted. <hi>That</hi> the English were
drawn out of the Realm by the authority of the
Pope, contrary to the customes of the Kingdom.
<hi>They complained of</hi> the coming among them
of the Popes infamous messenger,<note place="margin">Math. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris. An. 1245.</note> 
                  <hi>(non ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stante)</hi>
by which oaths, customes, writings,

of</hi> collections without the Kings leave, that
hospitality was not kept, the poor not sustained,
the Word not preached, Churches not adorned,
the cure of souls neglected, divine offices not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
and Churches ruined by the abuses of
the Papal Court. <hi>I cannot omit one clause
in the letter of the Lords to the Pope,</hi> Nisi

                  </gap>us. Vnlesse the
King and Kingdom be quickly freed from these
grievances, we must make a wall (of defence or
partition,) for the house of the Lord, and the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of the Kingdom, which we have hitherto
forborn to do out of our reverend respect of the
Apostolique See. <hi>They seem to allude to
that wall which</hi> Severus <hi>made to save the
Kingdom from the incursions of the Scots</hi>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:65458:81"/>
and Picts. Surely that was not more neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
then, than that wall of partition which
<hi>Henry</hi> the eighth made afterwards, to save
the Realm from the affronts and extortions
and injuries of the <hi>Roman</hi> Court.</p>
               <p>Neither did they make their addresses to
the Pope alone, but to the Councel of <hi>Lyons,</hi>
by the Procters of the whole Nobility and
Commonalty of England, for redresse of the
<hi>violent oppressions, intolerable grievances, and
impudent exactions which were practised in</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,<note place="margin">Idem an. 1245.</note>
                  <hi>by meanes of that hateful clause,</hi> non
obstante, <hi>too often inserted in the Popes let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi>
They represented that there were so
many Italians for the most part ignorant
and unlearned, that understood not one En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
word, nor did ever tread upon En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
ground, beneficed among them, that
their yearly revenue exceeded the revenue
of the Crown. Neither did they complain
onely,<note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> but threaten and swear that they
would not permit such abuses for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
But what ease did the poore English
find by complaining to the Pope either in
Councel or out of Councel? <hi>Martine</hi> the
Popes Commissioner (for he could not send
a Legate without the Kings consent) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torts,
excommunicates, interdicts; the Pope
himself is angry,<note place="margin">Id. an. 1246.</note> because like sturdy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<hi>they durst cry and whimper when they
were beaten,</hi> and perswades the King of
<hi>France</hi> to invade England, and either to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the King or subject him to the Court
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:65458:81"/>
of <hi>Rome,</hi> which lost the Pope the heart of the
English. The King told them that <hi>their
King began to kick against him, and play the</hi>
Frederick. And they threatened, that if he
<hi>persisted they should be forced to do that which
would make his heart ake.</hi> After this <hi>Edward</hi>
the third made his addresses likewise to
<hi>Rome</hi> for remedy of grievances, in the year
1343. How did he speed? No better then
his Great grandfather <hi>Henry</hi> the third,<note place="margin">Walsingh. p. 161.</note>
The Pope was offended, and termed his
modest expostulation rebellion. But that
wise and magnanimous Prince was not
daunted with words; to requite their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives,
he made the statutes of Provisoes
and <hi>praemunire,</hi> directly against the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments
and usurpations of the Court
of <hi>Rome.</hi> Whereby he so abated their
power in England for sundry ages follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that a Dean and Chapter were able to
deal with them, not onely to hold them at
the swords point, but to soile them.</p>
               <p>Lastly, King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth himself had
been long a suiter unto <hi>Clement</hi> the seventh,
to have his Predecessor <hi>Iulius</hi> the seconds
dispensation for his marriage with his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
wife, to be declared void. But though
the Popes own Doctors &amp; Universities had
declared the dispensation to be unlawfull
and invalide,<note place="margin">See theopc. of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ull in Antisan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derus.</note> and although the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
had once given forth a Bull privately
to his Legate Cardinall <hi>Campeius</hi> for the
revocation thereof, wherein he declared the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:65458:82"/>
marriage to be null, and that the King
could not continue in it without sinne; yet
the King found so little respect either to
the condition of his person, or to the justice
of his cause, that after long delayes, to try
if he could be allured to the Popes will, in
the conclusion he received a flat deniall.
This was no great incouragement to him to
make any more addresses to <hi>Rome.</hi> So what
was threatened and effected in part in the
dayes of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and <hi>Edward</hi> the
third, was perfected in the reign of <hi>Henry</hi>
the eighth, when the Jurisdiction of the
Court of Rome in England was abolished,
which makes the great distance between
them and us. Different opinions are often
devised or defended on purpose to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
faction; if animosities; were extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished,
and the mindes of Christians
free from prejudice, other controversies
might quickly be reconciled, and reduced
to primitive general truths. The power

Yea, the originall source &amp; true cause of all
the Separations, &amp; reformations made in the

<pb n="155" facs="tcp:65458:82"/>
himself not long since in a printed memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
and the Kingdom of <hi>Portugall</hi> likewise.
To conclude this point; These former
Kings who reigned in England about the
years 1200. and 1300. might properly be
called the first Reformers; and their Lawes
of Proviso's, and <hi>Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

They laid the Foundation,

               <p>Now having seen the authority of our

in the last place let us observe their due mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
in the manner of their separation.
First they did not; we do not deny the being
of any Church whatsoever, Roman or

especially such as hold firmly the Apostles
Creed, and the faith of the four first Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall

whether forreigners or domesticks, whether

               <p>But because the Roman Catholicks do
lay hold upon this charitable assertion of
ours, as tending mainly to their advantage:
Behold (say they) Protestants do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
a possibility of salvation in the Roman
Church; But Roman Catholicks deny all
possibility of Salvation in the Protestant
Churches; Therefore the Religion of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Catholiques is much safer then that of
Protestants. Hence proceeded their Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
of <hi>charity mistaken,</hi> and sundry other
discourses of that nature, wherein there are
mistakes enough, but little charity. For
answer, If this Objection were true, I should
love my Religion never the worse. Where I
find little charity, I look for as little faith:
But it is not true, for when the businesse is
searched to the bottom, they acknowledge
the same possibility of salvation to us, which
we do to them, that is, to such of either
Church respectively, as do not erre wilfully,
but use their best endeavours to find out the
truth. Take two testimonies of the Bishop
of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Protest. plain confession, Ch. 13. p. 151, 152.</note> 
                  <hi>If they</hi> (that is, the Protestants)
<hi>grant not salvation to such Papists as they
count vincibly ignorant of Roman errours, but
onely to such as are invincibly ignorant of them,
they have no more charity then we; for we grant
Church, saving faith, and salvation to such
Protestants as are invincibly ignorant of their
errours.</hi> And in his book of the distinction
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:65458:84"/>
of fundamentals, and not fundamentals, he
hath these words,<note place="margin">Ch. 2. p. 62.</note> 
                  <hi>If Protestants allow not
saving faith, Church, and salvation to such as
sinfully erre in not fundamentals sufficiently pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
they shew no more charity to erring Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
then Catholicks d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>; for we allow all to have
saving faith, to be in the Church, in way of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
(for so much as belongeth to faith,) who
hold the fundamental points, and invincibly erre
in not fundamentals, because neither are these
sufficiently proposed to them, nor they in fault
that they are not so proposed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, as our separation is from their
errours, not from their Churches: so we do
it with as much inward charity and modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our affections, as we can possibly;
willingly indeed in respect of their errours,
and especially their tyrannical exactions
and usurpations, but unwillingly and with
reluctation in respect of their persons, and
much more in respect of our common Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.
As if we were to depart from our
fathers, or our brothers house, or rather
from some contagious sicknesse wherewith
it was infected. Not forgetting to pray
God daily to restore them to their former
purity, that they and we may once again
enjoy the comfort and contentment of one
anothers Christian Society. We pray for
their conversion publickly in our Letany, in
general: And expressely and solemnly upon
Good Friday, though we know that they
do as solemnly curse us the day before. If
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:65458:84"/>
this be to be Schismaticks, it were no ill
wish for Christendome that there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
more such Schismaticks.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we do not arrogate to our selves
either a new Church, or a new Religion, or
new holy orders: for then we must produce
new miracles, new revelations, and new clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
tongues for our justification. Our
Religion is the same it was, our Church the
same it was, our holy orders the same they
were in substance, differing onely from what
they were formerly, as a garden weeded,
from a garden unweeded; or a body purged,
from it self before it was purged. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as we presume not to make new Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of faith, much lesse to obtrude such
innovations upon others; so we are not
willing to receive them from others, or to
mingle Scholastical opinions with funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
truths. Which hath given occasion
to some to call our Religion a negative reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
Not considering that our positive
articles are those general truths about which
there is no controversie. Our negation
is onely of humane controverted additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>Lastly, we are ready in the preparation
of our mindes to believe and practise, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
the Catholick Church (even of this
present age) doth universally and unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously
believe and practice. <hi>Quod apud mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos

And though it be neither lawful nor
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:65458:85"/>
possible for us to hold actual communion
with all sorts of Christians in all things,
wherein they vary both from the truth, and
one from another, yet even in those things
we hold a communion with them in our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
longing for their conversion and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union
with us in truth.</p>

               <head type="sub">That all Princes and Republiques of the
Roman Communion, do in effect the same
thing when they have occasion, or at
least do plead for it.</head>
               <p>SO we are come to our fifth Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
That whatsoever the King and
Church of England did in the separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of themselves from the Court
of Rome, it is no more then all Sovereign
Princes and Churches (none of whatsoever
communion excepted) do practise or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
as often as they have occasion. And
first, for all Protestant Kings, Princes, and
Republicks, it admits no deniall or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for the <hi>Grecian</hi> and all other
Eastern Churches, it can be no more doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of then of the Protestants, since they
never acknowledged any obedience to be
due from them to the Bishop of Rome, but
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:65458:85"/>
onely an honourable respect, as to the prime
Patriarch and beginning of unity. Whose
farewell or separation is said to have been
as smart as ours, and upon the same grounds
in these words,<note place="margin">Gers. part. 4. Ser. de pace et unit. Graec.</note> 
                  <hi>We acknowledge thy power, we
cannot satisfie thy covetousnesse, live by your

               </p>
               <p>But my aim extends higher to verifie
this of the Roman Catholick Princes and
Republicks themselves, as the Emperour,
the most Christian and Catholick Kings, the
Republick of <hi>Venice</hi> and others. To begin
with the Emperours: I do not mean those
ancient Christian Primitive Emperours who
lived and flourished before the daies of <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi>
the Great. Such a Court of Rome as
we made our secession from, was not then in
being, nor the Colledge of Parish Priests at
Rome turned then into a Conclave of
Cardinals, as Ecclesiastical Princes of the
Oecumenical Church. So long there was
no need of any separation from them, or
protestation against them. But I intend
the later Emperours since <hi>Gregorie's</hi> time,
after the Popes sought to usurp an universal
Sovereignty over the Catholick Church, and
more particularly the Occidental, that is to
say, the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>German</hi> Emperours.</p>
               <p>Yet the Reader may be pleased to take
notice,<note place="margin">The case of <hi>England</hi> not the same wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>h <hi>Germany;</hi>
                  </note> that the case of our Kings is much
different from theirs in two respects.</p>
               <p>First, they believed the Roman Bishop
to be their lawful Patriarch, (whether justly
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:65458:86"/>
or not, is not the subject of this present dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,)
But we do utterly deny his Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal
authority over us; And to demonstrate
our exemption, do produce for matter of
right that famous Canon of the General
Councel of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> made in the case of the
<hi>Cyprian</hi> Bishops; and for matter of fact, the
unanimous Votes of two <hi>British</hi> Synods, and
the concurrent testimonies of all our Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riographers.
Some have been formerly cited:
We might adde to them the ancient <hi>British</hi>
history, called by the Author thereof <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
wherein he relates this answer of the

British Primate, or Patriarch,) <hi>but they would
not obey</hi> Austine <hi>the Bishop of Romes Legate:
Neither would the Britanes who had evermore

               </p>
               <p>A second difference between our English
Kings and the later <hi>German</hi> Emperours is
this, that our Kings by the fundamental con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions
of the Kingdome are hereditary
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:65458:86"/>
Kings, and never die. So there is an unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
succession without any vacancy.
But the Emperours are elective, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
not invested in the actual posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of their Sovereignty without some
publick solemnities. Whereof some are
essential, as the votes of the Electours; some
others ceremonial, as the last Coronation
of the Emperour by the Bishop of Rome,
which was really, and is yet titularly his
Imperial City. But the Popes who had
learned to make their own advantage of
every thing, sacred or civil, took occasion
from hence to make the world believe that
the Imperial Crown was their gift, and the
Emperours their Liegemen. So <hi>Adrian</hi> the
fourth doubted not to write to <hi>Frederick
Barbarossa</hi> the Emperour, <hi>Insigne corona be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficium

taken, that (as the <hi>German</hi> Bishops in
their letter to the same Pope do affirm) <hi>the
whole Empire was moved at it, the ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

nor the Princes endure it, nor they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
either durst of could approve it.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Pope was forced to expound
himself, that by <hi>beneficium,</hi> he meant no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

                     </gap>mus,</hi> that
he had put the Crown upon him. So the
Emperour complaines in his letter to the
Bishops, <hi>A pictura coepit, à pictura ad Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pturam

<pb n="164" facs="tcp:65458:87"/>

from painting it proceeded to writing, And at
last they sought to justifie it by authority. We
will not</hi> (said he) <hi>suffer it,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                  <hi>we will not indure
it, we will rather lay down our Imperial Crown,
then suffer the Empire it self to be deposed, with
our consent. Let the pictures be defaced, let the

               </p>
               <p>Thus Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> failed of his design;
But his successour <hi>Iohn</hi> the 22. renewed the
Papal claim against <hi>Ludovicus</hi> the fourth, in

wherein he affirms, that <hi>after the translation of

the Electours and other Princes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested

               <p>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:65458:87"/>
This was the second repulse, yet the
Popes were not so easily shaken off; It
fortuned about the year 1400,<note place="margin">Goldast. part. 1. pag. 142.</note> that the
Electoral Colledge deposed <hi>Wenceslaus</hi> from
the Empire, and chose <hi>Rupert</hi> Prince Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
in his place, communicating the whole
businesse, whilest it was in agitation, to the
Pope, to have his spiritual advice, and the
countenance of the Apostolique See; but yet
reserving the power entirely to themselves.
Howsoever Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the ninth layes
hold of this opportunity, and declares by
his Bull, that the Electours did it <hi>by his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,

               <p>
                  <hi>This incertainty of succession, and this
Papal pretension made sundry Emperours
more fearful to grapple with the Popes, or
to right themselves from their grievous
exactions and usurpations. In the year 1455.

intreated and pressed both the advantage and

they prayed him for his Oathes sake, and to
prevent the infamy and dishonour of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that they alone might not want the fruit of
their National decrees, that he had as much

<hi>goes further,</hi> His rationibus victus &amp; permotus

and moved with these reasons, was about to make
as full a Sanction for his Subjects, as the King
of France had done for his. <hi>What hindered
him? Onely the advice of</hi> Aeneas Sylvius,
<hi>who perswaded him rather to comply with
the Pope, then with his people, upon this
ground, that</hi> Princes disagreeing might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled,

the enmity was immortal. Motus hac ratione

The Emperour being moved with this
reason, despising the request of his people, sends
the same Aeneas as his Ambassadour to Calistus.
The truth is this, The Emperour feared the
Pope, and durst not trust his own Subjects.
Whence it proceeded, that seven years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:65458:89"/>
Christ but an adoptive son of God,) <hi>did sit
in the Councel both as an hearer, and as a Iudge.
VVe determine and by the gift of God have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
what is to be held in this inquiry.</hi> And
it is very observable how he disposed the
resolutions of this Councel into four Books;
The first book contained the sense of the
Roman Bishop and his Suffragans;<note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> The
second of the Archbishop of <hi>Millain</hi> and the
Patriarch of <hi>Aquileia,</hi> with the rest of the
Italian Bishops; The third, the votes of
the German, French, and British Bishops;
The last, his own consent. The Romans
had no more part therein then others, to set
down their own faith, and to represent
what they had received from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.</p>
               <p>Neither did they onely convocate Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels,<note place="margin">Lib. 5. ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitul.</note>
and confirm them, but in them and by
them reformed innovations, and restored
ancient truths and Orders. So did the
same Emperour, <hi>By the counsel of our Bishops
and Nobles we have ordained Bishops through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Cities, and do decree to assemble a Synod
every year, that in our presence the Canenical
decrees and lawes of the Church may be rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ored.
Ludovicus Pius</hi> convocated a Councel
at <hi>Aquisgrane</hi> to reform the abuses of the
Clergy, and confirmed the same, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the constitutions thereof to be put
in execution,<note place="margin">Goldast. p. 1. pag. 12.</note> as appeareth by his own Epistle
to <hi>Arno</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Salzburge. Otho</hi> the

               <p>
                  <hi>I will conclude this first part of the paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel
with the words of the same Emperour, in
the same Councel,</hi> Quamvis noverim officio
ac dignitate Imperii penes nos esse potestatem
congregandorum Conciliorum, &amp;c. Although
I know that by vertue of our office and Imperial
dignity, the power of calling Councels rests in
us,<note place="margin">Rodevic. de Gestis Fred. 1. lib. 2. c. 56.</note> especially in so great dangers of the Church:
For both <hi>Constantine,</hi> and <hi>Theodosius,</hi> and
<hi>Justinian,</hi> and of fresher memory <hi>Charles</hi> the
Great and <hi>Otho,</hi> Emperours, are recorded to
have done this; Yet I do commit the authority
of determining this great and high businesse to
your wisdome and power, <hi>that is, to the Bishops
there assembled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it may be objected,<note place="margin">The En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation not Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical.</note> that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
with their Synods never made any
such Schismatical reformation, as that which
was made by the Protestants in England.
I answer, First, that the Schisme between
the Roman Court and the English Church,
(other Schisme I know none on our parts)
was begun long before that reformation in
the daies of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, and the breach
sufficiently proclaimed to the world, both
by Romish Bulls and English Statutes. We
could not be the first separatours of our
selves from them, who had formerly thrust
us out of their doors. It is not Schismati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:65458:90"/>
to substract obedience from them to
whom it is not due, who had extruded us
out of their Society: but it is Schismatical
to give just cause of substraction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, I answer, That there was a
great necessity of Reformation both in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many
and England. For proof whereof, I
produce two witnesses beyond exception,
the one a Pope, the other a Cardinal. The
former is</hi> Adrian <hi>the sixth, in his instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to his Legate, in the year 1522. which
the Princes of the Empire take notice of in
their auswer.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Goldast. part. 2. pag. 29. ct. 31.</note> 
                  <hi>His words are these,</hi> Scimus
in hac Sancta sede aliquot jam annis multa ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominanda
fuisse, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> VVe know that for some
by-past yeares many things to be abominated
have been in this holy See, abuses in spiritual
matters, excesses in commands; and to conclude,
all things out of order, &amp;c. wherein for so much
as concerns us, thou shalt promise that we will
use all our endeavour, that first this Court from
whence peradventure <hi>(sure enough)</hi> all the evil
did spring, may be reformed, that as corruption
did flow from thence to the inferiour parts <hi>(of
the Church),</hi> so may health and Reformation.
To procure which, we do hold our selves so much
more strictly obliged, by how much we do see the
whole world greedily desire such a Reformation.
O Adriane, si nunc viveres.</p>
               <p>The other witnesse is Cardinal <hi>Pool,</hi> who
makes two main ends of the Councel of
<hi>Trent:</hi> The one, the reconciling of the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans;</hi>
The other, quo pacto ipsius Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siae

<hi>To consider how the principal members of the
Church,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Regin. Polus de Concilio, pag. 86.</note> 
                  <hi>or rather almost all the members, might
be reduced to their ancient discipline and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
from which they had swerved much.</hi> Yet
when himself was sent afterwards by <hi>Paul</hi>
the fourth to reform the Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,<note place="margin">Reformatio Angliae, edit, Venet. 1562.</note>
it seemeth that he had forgotten
those great deviations of the principall
members, and those very representations
which he himself with eight other selected
Cardinals and Prelates had made upon oath
to <hi>Paul</hi> the third: Then he saw that this
lying flattering principle, that <hi>The Pop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

so many abuses and so grievous diseases had bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

Religion, and blaspheming of the Name of Christ:

pecuniary artifices: because <hi>it is not lawful

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, I answer, that the Emperours and
the German Church did not onely desire a
reformation,<note place="margin">An. 1415.</note> as appeareth by the Letter of

                  </note> And by the <hi>hundred Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
of the German Nation</hi> proposed to the

<pb n="174" facs="tcp:65458:92"/>
the Roman Empire, against the injuries, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortions,
and usurpations of the See of

of Ecclesiastical Courts, and persons:
And lastly, by the gracious promise of
<hi>Charles</hi> the fifth to hold a Dyett within
half a year, wherein it should be resolved,
what way the differences in Religion should
be settled and quieted,<note place="margin">Idem p. 2. pag. 177.</note> whether by a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
or National Councel, or Imperial
Dyett.</p>
               <p>Neither did the Emperour and the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Nation onely indeavour to reform, but
they did in some measure actually reform
the excesses of the Roman Court, and other
Ecclesiastical abuses and innovations; as it
hath already been verified of <hi>Charles</hi> the
Great,<note place="margin">Gold. p. 1. pag. 207.</note> and <hi>Ludovicus Pius.</hi> This appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
yet more plainly by the <hi>concordates</hi> (as
they are stiled) <hi>of the German Nation</hi> with
<hi>Gregory</hi> the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>: And the agreements of
<hi>Frederick</hi> the third and the Princes of the
Empire with Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> the fifth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the excesses and abuses of the Roman
Court are something abated, and reduced:<note place="margin">Id. p. 211.</note>
And by the Ghostly or Ecclesiastical refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
made by <hi>Sigismond</hi> the Emperour,<note place="margin">Idem. pag. 170.</note> in
the year 1436, containing 37 Chapters or
Articles, for regulating the Pope and his
Court, Cardinals, Archbishops, Bishops,
Suffragans, Abbats, Monks, Friars, Nunnes,
and all sorts of Ecclesiastical or religious
persons.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:65458:92"/>I cannot here omit a witty answer of this
Emperour, as he was deliberating with some
Ecclesiastical persons about a Reformation,
and one said it must begin with the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimes.<note place="margin">Catalog. te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stium veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis.</note>
No, said he, <hi>non à Minoritis, sed à
Majoritis,</hi> not with the Minimes, but with
the Maximes, or great ones, that is, the
Pope and the Cardinals, and the Court of
Rome.</p>
               <p>This appeares also by the <hi>Interim,</hi> or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
of Religion made by <hi>Charles</hi> the
fifth, attested with his Imperial seal, and
accepted and approved by the States of the
Empire, assembled in a Dyett at <hi>Ausburge,</hi>
May 15.<note place="margin">Gold. part. 2. p. 109.</note> in the year, 1548, where the whole
exercise of Religion is established, untill the
definition of a Councel. I produce it not
to shew what it was, but what power the
Emperour did assume in point of Religion;
wherein these words are contained: Quod
autem in supradicta declaratione sub ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brica,
de caeremoniis &amp; usu Sacramentorum
inter alia dicitur, <hi>[in quas tamen si quid ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repsit
quod causam dare possit superstitioni, tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latur.]</hi>
Reservat sibi soli Caesarea Majestas,
&amp;c. <hi>And whereas in the aforesaid declaration,
under the rubrick of ceremonies and the use of
the Sacraments, among other things it is said,
[into the which neverthelesse if any thing have
crept that may administer occasion of supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
let it be taken away.] His Imperial Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie
doth reserve unto himself alone in this and
the like Articles, where and as often as it shall
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:65458:93"/>
be needful, now and hereafter, the right to correct,
to adde, to detract, as it shall seem just and equal
to himself, according to the present exigence of
affaires.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly,<note place="margin">Gold. part. 2. p. 197.</note> this appeareth by the declaration
of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Emperour made in the year
1555, in favour of the <hi>Augustane</hi> Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and the professours thereof.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Kings of England in their
great Councels did make themselves the last
Judges of the liberties and grievances and
necessities of their people, even in cases Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical,
not the Pope. They had reason.
In vain is the Court of Romes determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
expected against it self. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
did the same.<note place="margin">Gold. p. 1. p. 103.</note> So <hi>Lodovic</hi> the fourth in
his Apology against Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> the 22<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth,
that the Pope ought not, cannot be
a competent Judge in his own cause. The
Pope challenged such a confirmation of the
Emperour, without which his election was
invalid. The Emperour determined the
contrary in the Dyet of <hi>Frankford, An. 1338.

                  <note place="margin">Idem pag. 99.</note> &amp;c. <hi>We declare that the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial

               <p>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:65458:93"/>When the Princes and States of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
had presented the hundred grievances
of the German Nation to the Popes Legate,
they adde this conclusion:<note place="margin">Goldast. part. 2. pag. 58.</note>

abovesaid burthens and grievances be not remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
within the time limited or sooner from the
eyes of men, and abolished and abrogated, (which
the Lay-States of the Empire do not expect,)
then they would not have his Holinesse to be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
that they neither can nor will bear or indure
the aforesaid most pressing and intolerable bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
any longer,</hi> but find out other means of

the remedy to be their own, and not leave
the cure to a tyrannical Court.</p>
               <p>To this adde the Protestation and the

               <p>I cannot here omit the free and just
speech of a French Bishop; When <hi>Henry</hi>
the fourth had in a manner ended the civill
Wars of France, by changing from the
Protestant to the Roman Catholique Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion:
Yet the Pope who favoured the
contrary party, upon pretence of his dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:65458:102"/>
and great dangers that might
ensue thereupon, for a long time deferred
his reconciliation, untill the French Prelates
by their own authority did first admit him
into the bosome of the Church. At which
time one of them used this discourse, <hi>Was</hi>
France <hi>all on fire, and had they not Rivers
enough at home, but they must run as far as</hi>
Rome, <hi>to</hi> Tybur, <hi>to fetch water to quench
it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Since that in Cardinal <hi>Richlieu's</hi> daies it
is well known what books were freely prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and publickly sold upon <hi>pont neuf,</hi> of
the lawfulnesse of erecting a new, or rather
restoring an old proper Patriarchate in
<hi>France,</hi> as one of the liberties of the <hi>Galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane</hi>
Church. It was well for the <hi>Roman</hi>
Court that they became more propitious to
the French affaires.</p>
               <p>Take one instance more which happened
very lately. The Pope refused to admit any
new Bishops in <hi>Portugal,</hi> upon the nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the present King, because he would
not thereby seem to acknowledge or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
his title to the Crown, in prejudice
of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> whereby the Episcopal
order in <hi>Portugal</hi> and the other Dominions
belonging to that Crown, was well near ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished,
and scarcely so many Bishops
were left alive, or could not be drawn toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as to make a Canonical Ordination.

execute his charge untill he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
the King in writing, under his oath
upon his holy orders, not to make use of his
Legantine power in the Kings Dominions
longer then it shall please the King. And
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:65458:104"/>
that so soon as he shall be admonished of
the Kings pleasure to forbid it, he will give
it over: And that whilest he doth use it,
it shall be exercised conformably to the
Kings will, without attempting any thing
to the prejudice of the decrees of Generall
Councels, or the liberties and priviledges of
the <hi>Gallicane</hi> Church, and the Universities
of France.</p>
               <p>6. The Commissions and Bulls of the Popes
Legates are to be seen, examined, and approved
by the Court of Parliament. <hi>And to be regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred

and not otherwise.</p>
               <p>7. The Prelates of the French Church,
<hi>(although commanded by the Pope,)</hi> for what
cause soever it be, <hi>may not depart out of the
Kingdom,</hi> without the Kings Commandment
of License.</p>
               <p>8. The Pope can neither by himself nor
by his Delegates judge of any thing which
concerneth the state, preheminence, or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
of the Crown of France, nor of any
thing pertaining to it: Nor can there be
any question or processe about the state or
pretensions of the King, but in his own
Courts.</p>
               <p>9. Papal Bulls, Citations, Sentences, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communications,
and the like, are not to be
executed in <hi>France</hi> without the Kings Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:65458:104"/>
or permission: And after permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
onely by authority of the King, and
not by authority of the Pope, to shun con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion

               <p>10. Neither the King nor his Realm,
nor his Officers can be excommunicated or
interdicted by the Pope, nor his Subjects
absolved from their Oath of Allegiance.</p>
               <p>11. The Pope cannot impose Pensions in
France upon any benefices having cure of
soules, nor upon any others, but according
to the Canons, according to the expresse
condition of the resignation, or <hi>ad redimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum

               </p>
               <p>12 All Bulls and Missives which come from
Rome to France are to be seen and visited,
to try if there be nothing in them prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial

               <p>13 It is lawful to appeal from the Pope

               <p>16. The Courts of Parliament in case of
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:65458:105"/>
appeales as from abuse have right and power
to declare null, void, and to revoke the
Popes Bulls and Excommunications, and to
forbid the execution of them, when they are
found contrary to sacred decrees, the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the French Church, or the preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Royal.</p>
               <p>17. Generall Councels are above the
Pope, and may depose him, and put another
in his place, and take cognisance of appeals
from the Pope.</p>
               <p>18. All Bishops have their power immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
from Christ, not from the Pope, and are
equally successours of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and the other
Apostles, and Vicars of Christ.</p>
               <p>19. Provisions, reservations, expectative
graces, &amp;c. have no place in France.</p>
               <p>20. The Pope cannot exempt any Church,
Monastery, or Ecclesiastical body from the
Jurisdiction of their Ordinary, nor erect
Bishopricks into Archbishopricks, nor unite
them, nor divide them without the Kings
Licence.</p>
               <p>21. All those are not hereticks, excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated,
or damned, who differ in some
things from the doctrine of the Pope, who
appeal from his decrees, and hinder the
execution of the ordinances of him or his
Legates.</p>
               <p>These are part of the liberties of the <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licane</hi>
Church. The ancient British Church
needed no such particular priviledges, since
they never knew any forreign Jurisdiction:
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:65458:105"/>
The <hi>English</hi> British Church which succeeded
them in time, in place, and partly in their
members and holy orders, ought to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
the same freedom and exemption. But
in the daies of the <hi>Saxon, Danish,</hi> and <hi>Norman</hi>
Kings, the Popes did by degrees insinuate
themselves into the mesnagery of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
affaires in <hi>England.</hi> Yet for many
ages the English Church injoyed all these
<hi>Gallicane</hi> priviledges, without any remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
interruption from the <hi>Roman</hi> Court.
As in truth they do of right by the Law of
nature belong to all Sovereign Princes, in
their own Dominions. Otherwise King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
should be destitute of necessary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies
for their own conservation. And
in later ages, when the Popes having thrust
in their heads, did strive to draw in their
whole bodies after, the whole Kingdome
opposed them, and made Lawes against their
several grosse intrusions, as we have former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
seen in this discourse: And never quitted
these English (as well as <hi>Gallicane)</hi> liberties,
untill the Reformation.</p>
               <p>But perhaps we may find more loyalty and
obedience to the Court of Rome in the
Catholick King.<note place="margin">The King of <hi>Spain</hi> asserts the liberties of his own Churches.</note> Not at all. Whatsoever

visible Head in the Church, Another head it
risen up, and brought into the Kingdome of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily,</hi>
for a Monster and a prodigy, &amp;c. <hi>But
for this liberty which he took, the King of</hi>
Spain <hi>fairly and quietly without taking any
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:65458:106"/>
notice of his Cardinalitian dignity, caused
his books to be burned publickly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It will be objected, That the King of
<hi>Spain</hi> challengeth this power in <hi>Sicily,</hi> not
by his Regal authority as a Sovereign
Prince, but by the Bull of <hi>Vrbanus</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
who constituted <hi>Roger</hi> Earl of <hi>Sicily</hi>
and his heires his Legates <hi>à latere</hi> in that
Kingdome, whereby all succeeding Princes
do challenge to be <hi>Legati nati,</hi> with power
to substitute others, and qualifie them with
the same authority.</p>
               <p>But first, if the Papacy be by Divine
right, what power hath any particular Pope
to transfer so great a part of his office and
authority from his Successours for ever, unto
a Lay-man and his heires, by way of inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance?
If every Pope should do as much
for another Kingdom, as <hi>Vrbanus</hi> did for
<hi>Sicily,</hi> the Court of Rome would quickly
want imployment.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if the Bull of <hi>Vrbanus</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
was so available to the succeeding
Kings of <hi>Sicily,</hi> which yet is disputed whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be authentick or not, whether it be
full, or defective, and mutilated, why should
not the Bull of <hi>Nicholas</hi> the second his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessour,
granted to our <hi>Edward</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessour
and his Successours, be as advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
to the succeeding Kings of <hi>England?</hi>
why not much rather? seeing that they are
thereby constituted or declared, not Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates,
but Governours of the English
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:65458:107"/>
Church, in the Popes place, or rather in
Christs place, seeing that without all doubt
<hi>Sicily</hi> was a part of the Popes ancient Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchate,
but <hi>Britaigne</hi> was not; And
lastly, seeing the situation of <hi>Sicily</hi> so much
nearer to <hi>Rome,</hi> renders the <hi>Sicilians</hi> more
capable of receiving Justice from thence,
then the English.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> when he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth,
and when he sees his own time, doth
not onely pretend unto, but assume in his
other Dominions that self-same power or
essential right of Sovereignty, which I plead
for in this treatise. It is not unknown to
the world how indulgent a Father <hi>Vrban</hi>
the eighth was sometimes to the King and
Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> and how passionately
he affected the interest of that Crown. And
by consequence that his eares were deaf to
the requests and remonstrances of the King
of <hi>Spain.</hi> The Catholique King resents this
partiality very highly, and threatens the
Pope if he persist, to provide a remedy for
the grievances of his Subjects, by his own
power. Accordingly to make good his
word, he called a general Assembly of all
the Estates of the Kingdome of <hi>Castile,</hi> to
consider of the exorbitancies of the Court
of Rome, in relation to his Majesties Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and to consult of the proper remedies
thereof. They did meet and draw up a
memoriall consisting of ten Articles, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the chiefest abuses and innovations,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:65458:107"/>
and extortions of the Court of Rome in
the Kingdom of <hi>Castile.</hi> His Majestie sends
it to the Pope by Friar <hi>Domingo Pimentell</hi>
as his Ambassadour; The Pope returned a
smart answer by Senior <hi>Maraldo</hi> his Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary.
The King replied as sharply. All
which was afterwards printed by the special
command of his Catholick Majesty.</p>
               <p>The summe of their complaint was first
concerning the Popes imposing of pensions
upon dignities and other benefices Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical,<note place="margin">Memorial de sa mage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stad Cato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lica.</note>
even those which had cure of
soules, in favour of strangers, in an excessive
proportion, to the third part of the full
value.<note place="margin">Chap. 1, 2, 3.</note> That although benefices were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed
in many places of <hi>Spain,</hi> two third
parts of the true value; Yet the Court of
Rome kept up the Pensions at the full
height: That it was contrived so, that the
Pensions did begin long before the benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciaries
entred upon their profits, insomuch
as they were indebted sometimes two
years pensions, before they themselves could
taste of the fruits of their benefices; And
then the charge of censures and other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
in the Court of Rome fell so heavy
upon them, that they could never recover
themselves. And further, that whereas all
trade is driven in current silver, onely the
Court of Rome which neither toiles nor
sweats, nor hazards any thing, will be paid
onely in Duckates of Gold, not after the
current rates, but according to the old
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:65458:108"/>
value. That to seek for a remedy of these
abuses at Rome, was such an insupportable
charge, by reason of three instances and
three sentences necessary to be obtained,
that it was in vain to attempt any such
thing. This they cried out upon as a most
grievous yoak.</p>
               <p>They complained likewise of the Popes
granting of Coad jutorships with future
succession,<note place="margin">Chap. 4.</note> whereby Ecclesiastical prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
were made hereditary, persons of
parts and worth were excluded from all
hopes, and a large gap was opened to most
grosse Simony.</p>
               <p>They complained of the Popes admitting
of resignations with reservation of the
greatest part of the profits of the benefice;<note place="margin">Chap. 5.</note>
insomuch, that he left not above an hundred
Duckats yearly to the Incumbent out of a
great benefice.</p>
               <p>They complained most bitterly of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortions
of the Roman Court,<note place="margin">Chap. 6.</note> in the case
of dispensations. That whereas no dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
ought to be granted without just
cause; now there was no cause at all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
after in the Court of Rome, but
onely the price. That a great price sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
the want of a good cause. That the
gate was shut to no man that brought
money. That their dispensations had no
limits but the Popes will. That for a matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial
dispensation under the second de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
they took of great persons 8000. or
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:65458:108"/>
12000. or 14000<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Duckats.</p>
               <p>They complained that the Pope being
but the Churches Steward and dispenser,<note place="margin">Chap. 7.</note>
did take upon him as Lord and Master, to
dispose of all the rights of all Ecclesiastical
persons. That he withheld from Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
being the true owners, the sole dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of all Ecclesiastical preferments, for
eight monthes in the year. That he ought
not to provide for his own profit, and the
necessities of his Court, with so great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
to the right of Ordinaries, and
Confusion of the Ecclesiastical order, whilest
he suffers not Bishops to enjoy their own
Patronages and Jurisdictions.<note place="margin">Lib. 4. de Consid. cap. 7.</note> They cite St.
<hi>Bernard,</hi> where he tells Pope <hi>Eugenius,</hi> that
<hi>the Roman Church (whereof he was made Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
by God) was the Mother of other
Churches, but not the Lady or Mistris. And
that he himself was not the Lord or Master of
other Bishops, but one of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They complained that the Pope did chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
and usurpe to himself as his own,<note place="margin">Chap. 8.</note> at
their deaths, all Clergymens estates, that
were gained or raised out of the revenue of
the Church. That a rich Clergyman could
no sooner fall sick, but the Popes Collectors
were gaping about him for his goods, And
guards set presently about his house. That
by this means Bishops have been deserted
upon their deathbeds, And famished for
want of meat to eat. That they have not
had before they were dead a Cup left to
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:65458:109"/>
drink in, nor so much as a Candlestick of
all their goods. It is their own expression.
That by this means Creditors were defrau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
processes in Law were multiplied, and
great estates wasted to nothing.</p>
               <p>They complained that the Popes did
usurp as their own all the revenues of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricks
during their vacancies,<note place="margin">Chap. 9.</note> sometimes
for divers years together, all which time the
Churches were unrepaired, the poor unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
not so much as one almes given;
And the wealth of <hi>Spain</hi> exported into a
forreign Land, which was richer then it self.
They wish the Pope <hi>to take it as an argument
of their respect to the See of</hi> Rome, <hi>that they do
not go about forthwith to reform these abuses by
their own auth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ity, in imitation of other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces.</hi>
So it was not the unwarrantable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the act in it self, but meerly their
respect that did withhold them.</p>
               <p>They complained of the great inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences
and abuses in the exercise of the
Nuncio's office.<note place="margin">Chap. 10.</note> That it is reckoned as a
curse in holy Scripture to be governed by
persons of a different language. That for
ten Crowns a man might purchase any thing
of them: That the fees of their office were
so great, that they alone were a sufficient
punishment for a grievous crime: They
added, that self-interest was the root of all
these evils. That <hi>such abuses as these gave
occasion to all the Reformations and Schismes of
the Church.</hi> They added, That these things
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:65458:109"/>
did much trouble the mind of his Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
Majestie; And ought to be seriously
pondered by all Sovereign Princes, <hi>qui intra
Ecclesiam potestatis adeptae Culmina tenent; ut
per eandem potestatem disciplinam Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam
muniant.</hi> Behold our Political Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy.
They proceeded, that <hi>often the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Kingdome is advantaged by the earthly.
That Church-men acting against faith and right
discipline, may be reformed by the rigour of
Princes. Let the Princes of this world know</hi>
(say they) <hi>that they owe an account to God of
the Church, which they have received from him
into their protection. For whether peace and
right Ecclesiastical discipline be increased or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed
by Christian Princes, God will require an
account from them, who hath trusted his Church
unto their power.</hi> They tell his Holinesse it
was a work worthy of him to turn all such
Courtiers out of his Court, who did much
hurt by their persons, and no good by their
examples. Adding this distich;
<q>
                     <l>Vivere qui sanctè cupitis discedite Roma,</l>

that the Popes Nuncio's should not

               <p>Lastly,<note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> they represented that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie
was justly pressed by the continual
clamours, and reiterated instances of his
Subjects, to whose assistence and protection
he was obliged to contribute whatsoever he
was able, as their Natural Lord and King,
to procure their weal with all his might, by
all just means, according to the dictates of
natural reason. And to remedy the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
which they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uffered in their persons
and in their goods, by occasion of such like
abuses, not practised in other Kingdomes.
Especially this proposit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>on being so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
to the Apostolical precepts, and
to the sacred Canons of Councels.</p>
               <p>They tell the Pope, that their first addresse
is to him, to whom as universal Pastour the
Reformation thereof doth most properly
belong, <hi>that there might be no need to proceed
to other remedies prescribed by the Doctours of
the Church.</hi> And in the margent they cite
more then twenty several Authours, to shew
what the Magistrate might do, in case the
Pope should refuse or neglect to reform
these abuses<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So you see they confessed
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:65458:110"/>
plainly, that there were other lawful reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
And intimated sufficiently that they must
proceed to the use of them, in case the
Pope refused or neglected to do his duty.
That was for the Sovereign Prince with his
Bishops and Estates to ease his Subjects, and
reform the abuses of the Roman Court
within his own Dominions. And this by
direction of the Law of nature. Upon our
former ground, that no Kingdom is desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of necessary remedies for its own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation.
But they chose rather to tell the
Pope this unwelcome Message in the names
and words of a whole cloud of Roman
Catholick Doctours, then in their own.</p>
               <p>In fine, the Pope continued obstinate:
And the King proceeded from words to
deeds; And by his Sovereign power stopped
all proceedings in the Nuncio's Court. And
for the space of eight weeks did take away
all intercourse and correspondence with
Rome, (This was the first act of <hi>Henry</hi> the
eighth, which <hi>Sanders</hi> calls the beginning
of the Schisme,) untill the Pope being taught
by the costly experience of his predecessours,
fearing justly what the consequents of these
things might be in a little time, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

to bow, and condescend to the

               <p>Before we leave the Dominions of this

upon <hi>Brabant</hi> and <hi>Flanders;</hi> who hath not

Bishop of <hi>Ypres,</hi> called <hi>Augustinus;</hi> And
of those great animosities and contentions
that have risen about it in most Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Countreys? I meddle not with the
merit of the cause, whether <hi>Iansenius</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
Saint <hi>Austine,</hi> or Saint <hi>Austine</hi> his
Ancients, or whether he be reconciliable to
himself in this question. I do willingly
omit all circumstances, but onely those
which conduce to my present purpose. So
it was that <hi>Vrbane</hi> the eighth by his Bull
censured the said Book, as maintaining
divers temerarious and dangerous positi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
under the name of St. <hi>Austine,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding
all Catholicks to print it, sell it, or
keep it for the future. This Bull was sent
to the Archbishop of <hi>Mechline,</hi> and the
Bishop of <hi>Gant</hi> to see it published and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in their Provinces. But they both refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;
And for refusing were cited to appear

is about taxes imposed upon Ecclesiastical

give this satisfaction, that <hi>all orders of men are
obliged in justice to contribute to the common
defence of the Kingdom and their own necessary

               <p>In summe, they wish the Pope over and

               <p>I will conclude this point with the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
of the University of <hi>Lisbone</hi> to certain
questions or demands,<note place="margin">Imprss. Olissiponae, an. 1649.</note> moved unto them
by the States or Orders of <hi>Portugal.</hi> The
first question was, whether in case there
were no recourse to the Pope, the King of
<hi>Portugal</hi> might permit the consecration of
Bishops without the Pope in his Kingdom?
To which their answer was affirmative, that
he might do it, because <hi>Episcopacy was of
divine right, but the reservation of the Popes
approbation was of humane right, which doth
not bind in extreme nor in very great necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second question, whether there was
extreme necessity of consecrating new Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
in <hi>Portugal?</hi> Their answer was affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative,
that there was, because there was
but one Bishop left in <hi>Portugal,</hi> and six and
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:65458:114"/>
twenty wanting in the rest of the Kings
dominions.</p>
               <p>The third question was, whether <hi>Portugal</hi>
had then recourse to the Pope for his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation?
The answer was Negative, that
they had not; first, because the <hi>Castilians</hi>
had attempted to slay their Ambassadour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
before the eyes of <hi>Vrban</hi> the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. and <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi>
the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. So there was no safe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.
And secondly, because their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour
could uot prevail with the Pope
in nine years, by all their solicitations: So
there was no hope to obtain.</p>
               <p>The fourth question was, whether the
permission of this were scandalous? The
answer was Negative, that it was not;
first, because it was a greater scandal to
want Bishops. Secondly, because the King
had used all due means to obtain the Popes
approbation. Thirdly, because it was done
out of extreme necessity.</p>
               <p>The fifth and last question was, how Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
were to be provided? They answered,
that it was to be done according to Law,
by the election of the respective Chapters,
and by the presentation of the King, as it
was of old in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> and was
still observed in <hi>Germany</hi> and elsewhere.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> it is now high

it were no difficult matter to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may perhaps be objected, That the
<hi>Venetian</hi> State had these priviledges granted
to them by the Popes, and Court of Rome.
And it is thus far true, That they had five
Bulls,<note place="margin">Nicomaco Philal. aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

the eighth, one of <hi>Alexander</hi> the
sixth, and the last of <hi>Paul</hi> the third. But
it is as true, that none of these Bulls con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
any of the matters in debate, but
only the punishment of delinquent Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
It hath been an old subtlety of the
Popes, that when the Emperours or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
had granted any Ecclesiastical privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
or honour to any person or Society,
which it was not in their power to crosse;
Yet straightway their Bulls did flie abroad,
either of concession, or confirmation, or
Delegation, to make the world believe that
nothing could be done without them.</p>
               <p>But how or by what right did the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi>
claim these priviledges? By virtue of
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:65458:117"/>
any Papal Bulls? No such thing. But by
the Law of nature as an essential right of
Sovereignty, and by a most ancient custome
of 1200 years, that is, a thousand years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the first Bull was dated,<note place="margin">Raccolta degli Sc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

by a letter of the Senate of <hi>Venice</hi> to the
<hi>Venetian</hi> Commons their Subjects.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it may be urged further, that
the <hi>Venetians</hi> did not make a total and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
separation from <hi>Rome.</hi> No more
did <hi>England,</hi> if by Rome we understand the
Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Can. 30.</note> First not total, but onely

                     </gap>ounders.</hi> Which are the very
words of our Canon. Secondly, not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual,
but onely temporary, untill their
errours be amended, and abuses reformed.</p>
               <p>But if by <hi>Rome</hi> be understood the Roman
Court, the case of <hi>Ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ice</hi> and <hi>England</hi> is
much different: They acknowledge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be justly subject to the Roman
Patriarch; we do altogether deny his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction
over us; The vicinity of <hi>Venice</hi>
renders them capable of receiving Justice
from Rome, which the distance of <hi>England</hi>
being so far divided by Seas and Mountains
doth hinder us of. Their interest invited
them to a conjunction with Rome: Ours
is against it. But yet they take care for
their own security and indemp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ity, that the
Papacy which they submitted unto should
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:65458:118"/>
be toothlesse, not able to bite them or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure
them. If that Papacy which they
sought to have obtruded upon us, had been
such an one, in probability they had not so
quickly been turned out of doores.</p>
               <p>Lastly, it may be objected, that the
points in difference between Rome and us be
many more, then those which were in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Venice.</hi> This indeed
is most true; But not much material. More
or lesse do not vary the kind or nature of
any thing. Whether their liberties or ours
be of greater or lesser extent, is impertinent
to our question. If <hi>Venice</hi> ought to enjoy
their ancient liberties and customes, then
so ought <hi>England</hi> also. If the <hi>Venetians</hi>
ought to be the last Judges of their own
pretensions, what their ancient customes
and liberties were, then so ought we to be
likewise. Not the Pope and his conclave
of Cardinals, which if <hi>Venice</hi> would not
endure, we have much l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sse reason to endure
it. What Canons have been received
with us, and how far, and where our shoe
did wring us, none knew so well as our
selves.</p>
               <p>The chiefest difference between our case
and that of <hi>Venice,</hi> seems to me to be this,
That we were put to an a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ter-game, so
were not they: They preserved their
rights and priviledges then in question in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
from the usurpations of the Roman
Court; we were necessitated in part to
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:65458:118"/>
retrive and vindicate ours. Theirs was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
a Conservation; Ours a Reformation.
They might thank the unanimity of their
Subjects, the loyalty of their Clergy, and
their nearer acquaintance with Rome for
their advantage, we might blame the Barons
Wars, and the contentions between the
houses of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaster,</hi> and a kind
of superstitious veneration of that See,
occasioned by our distance and want of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental
knowledge, for our disadvant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</p>
               <p>But to come to the Catastrophe of this
businesse.<note place="margin">The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</note> Both sides grew weary of the
difference. Christian Princes mediated a
Peace, especially the most Christian King.
The <hi>Venetians</hi> were contented to shake
hands and be friends with the Court of
Rome; But without any reparation, or
submission, or confession, or so much as a
request to be made on their parts. They
refused to abrogate any one of the Lawes
complained of. They refused (though the
Pope did presse it most instantly, and the
Cardinal <hi>Ioieuse</hi> did assure them that it
would be more acceptable to his Holinesse
then the conquest of a Kingdome,) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>admit
the banished persons into their City.
They refused to take an absolution from
<hi>Rome;</hi> Yea, they were so far from it, that
when the Ambassadour intreated that the
Duke might receive a benediction from him
publickly in the Church, both the Duke
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:65458:119"/>
and the Senate did resolutely oppose it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it had some appearance of an absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>A man would have thought that this
might have sufficed to have caught the Popes
more wit, then to have hazarded their repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
again, so near home, where they are
so well known; But it did not. They ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured
after this to make their spiritual
weapons subservient to their temporal ends,
by excommunicating and interdicting the
Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> and his Subjects, with little
better successe.</p>
               <p>I expect that it should be alledged, That
all the Projects of <hi>France</hi> for a new Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chate,
and the memorials of <hi>Castile,</hi> and the
bleatings of <hi>Portugal,</hi> &amp;c. were but perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
shewes, to terrifie Popes into their
duties; And in part I do believe it to be
true. But withal they must yeeld thus much

there must be probable and just grounds,
that such things as are pretended may be,

home to their own doores. Wherein I
endeavour to demonstrate that the
Church of Rome,<note place="margin">The Church but principally the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> is 4. waies guilty of schisme.</note> or rather the Pope and
the Court of Rome are causally guilty both
of this Schisme, and almost all other Schisms
in the Church. First, by seeking to usurpe
an higher place and power in the body Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical,
then of right is due unto them.
Secondly, by separating, both by their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
and censures, three parts of the
Christian world from their Communion,
and as much as in them lies from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of Christ. Thirdly, by rebelling
against general Councels. Lastly, by break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or taking away all the lines of Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
Succession except their own.</p>
               <p>First, they make the Church of Rome to
be not onely the sister of all other Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal
Churches, and the Mother of many
Churches, but to be the Lady and Mistris
of all Churches; To be not onely a prime
stone in the building, but the very founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
to be not onely a respective founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in relation to this or that time and
place, (as all the Apostles and all Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:65458:120"/>
Churches were, and all good Pastours
and all orthodox Churches are,) but to be
an absolute foundation for all persons, in all

alone: <hi>Other foundation can no man lay then
that which is laid, even Iesus Christ.</hi> They

root of Christian Religion, or at least of all
that Jurisdiction which Christ left as a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy

by the Church of Rome, they understand
not the essential Church, nor yet the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentative
Church, a Roman Synod, but
the virtual Church which is invested with
Ecclesiastical power, that is, the Pope with
his Cardinals and Ministers. When any

               <p>But in the second place, we presse the

way of Christian discretion, by withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of themselves for fear of infection; But
privatively and authoritatively by way of
Jurisdiction, excluding them (so much as
in them lieth) from the Communion of
Christ; Though those Churches so chased
away by them contain three times more
Christian souls then the Church of Rome
it self, with all its dependents and adherents;
many of which do suffer more pressures for
the testimony of Christ, then the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists
do gain advantages, and are ready to
shed the last drop of their blood for the
least known particle of saving truth. Onely
because they will not strike topsaile to
the Popes crosse-keys, nor buy indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences
and such like trinkets at Rome. It
is not passion, but action that makes a schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick,
to desert the communion of Chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stians
voluntarily, not to be thrust away
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:65458:121"/>
from it unwillingly. For divers years in
the beginning of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> reign,
there was no Recusant known in England;
But even they who were most addicted to
Roman opinions, yet frequented our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
and publick assemblies, and did joyn
with us in the use of the same prayers and
divine offices, without any scruple, untill they
were prohibited by a Papal Bull; meerly
for the interest of the Roman Court. This
was the true beginning of the schisme be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us and them. I never yet heard any
of that party charge our Leiturgy with any
errour, except of omission, that it wanted
something which they would have inserted;
I wish theirs as free from exception, to trie
whether we would shunne their communion
in the publick service of God. Charity
would rather chuse to want something that
was lawful, then willingly to give occasion
of offence.</p>
               <p>But to lay the axe to the root of schisme
in the third place; the Papacy it self, <hi>(qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

talis,)</hi> as it is now maintained by many,
with superiority above general Councels,
and a Sovereign power paramount to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
or reject their sanctions, is the cause
either procreant, or conservant, or both,
of all or the most part of the schismes in
Christendom. To rebell against the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick

time, whereof one was undoubtedly the
true Pope. These things are so obvious in
the history of the Church, that it were va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and lost labour to prove them. But
especially contrary to the Councel of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi>
and <hi>Basile,</hi> which have decreed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly,<note place="margin">Conc. Const. Sess. 4.</note>
that <hi>the Pope is subject to a General
Councel as well in matter of faith, as of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;
So as he may not onely be corrected; but
if he be incorrigible, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e deposed.</hi> This is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined

addition, that <hi>whosoever opposeth this truth
pertinaciously, is to be reputed an heretick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This decree of the Councel wounds deep,
because it is so evident and clear in the
point, and because the decrees thereof were
confirmed by <hi>Martine</hi> the fifth. But the
Romanists have found out a salve for it,
That <hi>Pope Martine confirmed onely those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
which were conciliarly made,</hi> that is,
with the influence and concurrence of the
Pope; As the condemnation of <hi>Wickliff</hi> and
<hi>Hus:</hi> But <hi>not those decrees which were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliarly
made,</hi> that is, which wanted the
influence of the Pope; As the decree of the
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:65458:122"/>
Superiority of the Councel above the Pope.
Which ought to be understood (say they)
onely of dubious Popes.</p>
               <p>For clearing of which doubt, I propose
several considerations:</p>
               <p>First,<note place="margin">The Popes confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Councels of no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue.</note> that it is not material whether the
decree were confirmed by the Pope or
not. There are two sorts of confirmation,
<hi>Approbative,</hi> and <hi>Anthoritative;</hi> Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
confirmation is by way of testimony, or
suffrage, or reception. And so an inferiour
may confirm the acts of his Superiour. As
it is said, that <hi>the Saints shall judge the world,</hi>
that is, by their doctrine, by their example,
and by their approbative suffrage, <hi>Iust ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
thou, O Lord, and right are thy judgments.</hi>
Authoritative confirmation implies either a
sole Legislative power, or at least a nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
voice: Whereas it is as clear as the
light, that the Popes anciently never had
either the one or the other in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church. We meet with no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmations
of General Councels of old, but
onely by the Emperours, whereby Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
Sanctions became civil Lawes, and
obliged all the Subjects of the Empire under
a civil pain. Wherefore it is no matter
whether the Pope confirmed the decree or
not, whether it was confirmed or uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed;
it lets us see what was the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
tradition, and the sense of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
world in those daies; And we abide in
it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:65458:123"/>
Secondly,<note place="margin">The decree of the Councels superiority above the Pope mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t conciliarly made.</note> I reply, that this decree was
most conciliarly made, and consequently
confirmed, made after due examination and
discussion, without any under-hand packing
or labouring for voices, made in the publick
Session, not privately before the Deputies
of the Nations. For clearing whereof take
this Dilemma. Either this decree and the
subsequent Acts done by vertue and in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
thereof, were conciliarly made and
confirmed, and consequently valid in the
judgment of the Romanists themselves, or
unconciliarly made, and consequently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their rules not confirmed, but
invalid. If they grant, that this decree was
conciliarly made and confirmed, then they
grant the question. If they say it was not
conciliarly made nor confirmed, then <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>
the fifth was no true Pope, but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truder
and an usurper, and consequently
his confirmation was of no value; for in
pursuance of this very decree, and by virtue
of that doctrine therein delivered, the other
Popes were deposed, and he was created
Pope.</p>
               <p>But to clear that passage from all ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity.
There were in the Councel of
<hi>Constance</hi> the Deputies of the Nations as a
selected Committee to examine matters, and
prosecute them, and prepare them for the
Councel. What was done apart by these
Deputies, by this Committee, was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliarly
done. But what was done in the
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:65458:123"/>
publick Session of the Councel, upon their
report, that was conciliarly done. Now
so it was, that one <hi>Falkemberch</hi> had pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
a dangerous and seditious book, which
had been complained of to the Deputies of
the Nations, and condemned by them: But
the conjoynt body of the Councel in their
publick Session had not condemned it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliarly.
Yet after the Councel was ended,
and after the Cardinal had given the Fathers
their Conge, or leave to depart, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missed
them with <hi>Domini ite in pace, Fathers
depart in peace;</hi> And the Fathers had answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<hi>Amen.</hi> When there was nothing left
to do, but to hear a Sermon and be gone,
The Ambassadours of <hi>Polonia</hi> and <hi>Lituania,</hi>
very unseasonably pressed the Pope to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
that book, alledging, that it had been
condemned by the Deputies of the Nations.
To which the Pope answered, That <hi>he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
onely those Acts of the Councel which
were conciliarly made.</hi> That is to say, Not
the Acts of the Deputies of the Nations
apart, but the publick Acts of the whole
Session. This is the genuine sense of that
passage which bears its own evidence along
with it, to every one that doth not wilfully
shut his eyes. This was an accidental emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
after the Synod was ended, and not
the solemn purposed confirmation.</p>
               <p>And concerning that glosse, that the
decree is to be understood onely of dubious
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:65458:124"/>
Popes, or Popes whose title is litigious. As
it contradicts the text it self, which includes
all dignitaries whosoever, of whatsoever
title peaceable or litigious, Popes or others;
So it is sufficiently confuted by the very exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of the decree. An inferiour may
declare the lawful right of his Superiour,
and where there are divers pretenders,
establish the possession in him that hath the
best title. But to make right to be no right,
to turn all pretenders right or wrong out of
possession, onely by the last Law of <hi>Salus
Populi,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for the tranquillity of the people,</hi>
This is a prerogative of Sovereign Princes,
and a badge of Legislative authority. This
was the very case of the Councel of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance;</hi>
They turned out all pretenders to
the Papacy, the right Pope and the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>popes
all together. Some of them indeed
by perswasion, but such perswasion as might
not be resisted; And one whose title seemed
clearest, which rendered their perswasions
as unto him ineffectual, by plain power.
For so the Councel with the consent and
concurrence of Christian Princes, did find it
expedient for Christendome.</p>
               <p>Lastly, though the Popes do not abolish
the order of Bishops, or Episcopacy in the
abstract, yet they limit the power of Bishop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
in the concrete at their pleasure, by exempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and reservations, holding themselves to
be the Bishops of every particular See in the
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:65458:124"/>
world, during the vacancy of it; And
making all Episcopal Jurisdiction to flow
from them, and to be founded in the Popes
Lawes; Because it was but delegated to the
rest of the Apostles for term of life; But
resided soly in Saint <hi>Peter</hi> as an Ordinary, to
descend from him to his Successours Bishops
of Rome; And to be imparted by them to
other Bishops as their Vicars or Coadju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours,
assumed by them into some part of
their charge. By this account the Pope
must be the universal or onely Bishop of the
world. The keyes must be his gift, not
Christs: And all the Apostles except Saint
<hi>Peter,</hi> must want their Successours in Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Jurisdiction.
What is this but to tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
upon Episcopacy, and to make them
equivocal Bishops, to dissolve the primitive
bonds of brotherly unity, to overthrow the
discipline instituted by Christ, and to take
away the line of Apostolical Succession?</p>
               <p>The name of Oecumenical or universal
Bishop is taken in three senses, one without
controversie lawful, one controverted whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
lawfull or unlawfull; And one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
unlawful and Schismatical. In
the first sense an universal Bishop signifies
no more then an eminent Bishop of the
universal Church, implying an universality
of care and vigilance, but not of Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And in this sense all the five Protopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs
used more Emphatically to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
universal Bishops. Either by reason
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:65458:125"/>
of their reputation and influence upon the
universal Church or their presidence in
general Councels.</p>
               <p>In another sense, an universal Bishop
signifies such a Bishop who besides an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
care, doth also challenge an universal
Jurisdiction. This was that title which <hi>Iohn</hi>
Bishop of <hi>Constantinople</hi> affected, <hi>omnibus
praeesse,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Greg. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>nulli subesse:</hi> And again, <hi>Cuncta
Christi membra sibimet supponere universali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis

<hi>Gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>gory</hi> the Great and his predecessours re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused,
(if they did refuse any such title).
For it were evident madnesse to fancy, that
ever any General Councel did offer any
particular Bishop the title of the only Bishop
of the world. This title in this sense was
that which <hi>Gregory</hi> himself did condemn, as
a <hi>vain, profane, wicked, blasphemous, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, the name of Universal Bishop
may be taken exclusively, for the only Bishop
of the world. Which sense was far enough
from the intention either of <hi>Gregory</hi> the
Great, or <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> who had
both of them so many true Archbishops
and Bishops under them. But this sense
agrees well enough with the extravagant
ambition of the later Popes, and of the
Roman Court, who do appropriate all ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
Jurisdiction to themselves. So many
waies is the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> guilty of Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
pravity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="241" facs="tcp:65458:125"/>
Besides these branches of Schisme, there
are yet two other novelties challenged by
the Popes, and their Parasitical Courtiers.
But neither these nor the other yet defined
by their Church, both destructive to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
unity, both apt to breed and nourish,
to procreate and conserve Schisme. An
infallibility of judgment, and a temporall
power over Princes either directly or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly.
General and Provincial Councels
are the proper remedies of Schisme. But
this challenge of infallibility diminisheth
their authority, discrediteth their definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and maketh them to be superfluous
things. What needs so much expence? so
many consultations? so much travel of so
many poor old fallible Bishops from all the
quarters of the world? when there is an

<hi>Benedictus,</hi> and <hi>Sergius,</hi> who clashed one
with another, and abrogated the decrees
one of another over and over again, such
infallible Judges? Neither is it meer mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of fact to decree the Ordinations of a
lawful Bishop to be void. To omit many
others.</p>
               <p>But howsoever they tell us,<note place="margin">Conc. S<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuess. et Rom.</note> That <hi>the first
See cannot be judged.</hi> I will not trouble my
self about the credit of the authorities,
whether they be true or counterfeit; Nor
whether the first See signifie <hi>Rome</hi> alone, or
any other of the five Proto-Patriarchates.
Thus much is certain, that by judgment of
discretion any private man may judge the
Pope, and withdraw from him in his errours,
and resist him if he invade either the bodies
or the soules of men, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth.
That in the Court of Conscience
every ordinary Pastour may judge him, and
bind him, and loose him, as an ordinary
man. And by their leaves in the external
Court by coercive power if he commit civil
crimes, the Emperour; if Ecclesiastical, a
Councel, or the Emperour with a Councel
may judge him, and in some cases declare
him to be fallen from his Papal dignity by
the sentence of the Law; in other cases if he
be incorrigible, depose him by the sentence
of the Judge. But there is a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between the judgment of Subjects, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of a General Councel, and the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of an assembly of Suffragans and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours.
And yet the Roman Clergy are

Bishop, and justly. Or otherwise <hi>Foelix</hi>

               <p>Their other challenge of temporal power,

Subjects to their Sovereignes. <hi>Gregory</hi> the
seventh began this practice against <hi>Henry</hi>
the fourth. But what <hi>Gregory</hi> did bind up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
earth, God Almighty did not bind in
heaven. His Papal blessing turned to a
curse; And instead of an Imperial Crown,
<hi>Rodolph</hi> found the just reward of his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
               <p>The best is, that they who give these
exorbitant priviledges to Popes, do it with
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:65458:127"/>
so many cautions and reservations, that
they signifie nothing, and may be taken

               <p>The Pope (say they) is infallible, not in
his Chamber, but in his Chair; not in the
premisses, but in the conclusion; not in
conclusions of matter of fact, but in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions
of matter of faith. Not alwaies in
all conclusions of matter of faith, but onely
when he useth the right means and due dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.
And who knoweth when he doth
that? So every Christian is infallible, if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>So likewise for his temporal power over
Princes, they say the Pope, not as Pope, but
as a spiritual Prince, hath a certain kind of
power, temporal, but not meerly tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral;

               <p>BUt it is not enough to charge the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> unlesse we can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
our selves, and acquit our
own Church of the guilt of Schisme,
which they seek to cast upon us. First,
they object, that we have separated our
selves Schismatically from the communion
of the Catholick Church. God forbid.
Then we will acknowledge, without any
more to do, that we have separated our
selves from Christ, and all his holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
and from the benefit of his Passion,
and all hope of salvation.</p>
               <p>But the truth is,<note place="margin">We have not separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted our selves from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church.</note> we have no otherwise
separated our selves from the communion
of the Catholick Church, then all the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Orthodox Fathers and Doctours and
Churches did long before us, that is, in the
opinion of the Donatists, as we do now in
the opinion of the Romanists; because the
Romanists limit the Catholick Church now
to <hi>Rome</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> and those Churches that
are subordinate to it, as the Donatists did
then to <hi>Cartenna</hi> in <hi>Africk,</hi> and those
Churches that adhered to it. We are so
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:65458:128"/>
far from separating our selves from the
communion of the Catholick Church, that
we make the communion of the Christian
Church to be thrice more Catholick, then
the Romanists themselves do make it, and
maintain Communion with thrice so many
Christians, as they do. By how much our
Church should make it self, as the case
stands, more Roman then it is, by so much
it should thereby become lesse Catholick
then it is.</p>
               <p>I have shewed before out of the Canons
and Constitutions of our Church, that we
have not separated our selves simply and
absolutely from the communion of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Church whatsoever, even the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
it self, so far forth as it is Catholick,
but onely from their errours wherein they
had first separated themselves from their
predecessours.</p>
               <p>To this I adde, that it was not we, but
the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> it self that first separated
<hi>England</hi> from the communion of the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi>

<pb n="247" facs="tcp:65458:128"/>
Convent of <hi>Trent</hi> to have been no General,
nor yet Patriarchal; no free, no lawfull
Councel. How was that General, where
there was not any one Bishop out of all the
other Patriarchates, or any Proctours or
Commissioners from them, either present,
or summoned to be present, except perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
some tltular <hi>Europaean</hi> Mock-Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
without cures, such as <hi>Olaus Magnus</hi>
intituled Archbishop of <hi>Vpsala;</hi> Or Sir
<hi>Robert</hi> the Scottish-man intituled Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
of <hi>Armagh?</hi> How was that Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
or so much as Patriarchal, where so
great a part of the West was absent, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
there were twice so many <hi>Episcopelles</hi> out
of <hi>Italy,</hi> (the Popes professed Vassals, and
many of them his hungry Parasitical pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners,)
as there were out of all other
Christian Kingdoms and Nations put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
How was that general wherein there
were not so many Bishops present at the
determination of the weightiest controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
concerning the rule of faith, and the
exposition thereof, as the King of <hi>England</hi>
could have called together in his own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions
at any one time upon a moneths
warning? How was that general, which
was not generally received by all Churches?
even some of the Roman Communion not
admitting it.</p>
               <p>We have seen heretofore how the <hi>French</hi>
Ambassadour in the name of the King and
Church of <hi>France</hi> protested against it. And
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:65458:129"/>
untill this day though they do not oppose
it, but acquiesce, to avoid such disadvant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages
as must insue thereupon; yet they did
never admit it. Let no man say that they
rejected the determinations thereof onely
in point of discipline, not of doctrine; for
the same Canonical obedience is equally
due to an acknowledged General Councell
in point of discipline, as in point of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
               <p>And as it was not General, so neither
was it free,<note place="margin">Not free.</note> nor lawfull. Not free, where
the place could afford no security to the one
party, where the accuser was to be the
Judge,<note place="margin">Sleid. l. 17.</note> where any one that spake a free
word had his mouth stopped, or was turned
out of the Councel, where the few Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants

not admitted to dispute, where the Legates
gave auricular Votes, where the Fathers
were noted to be guided by the spirit sent

               </p>

And likewise in regard of the
Judge. In every Judgment there ought to
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:65458:129"/>
be four distinct persons; The accuser, the
witnesse, the guilty person, and the Judge.
But in the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> the Pope by
himself or his Ministers acted all these parts
himself. He was the right guilty person,
and yet withall the accuser of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,
the witnesse against them, and their
Judge. Lastly, no man can be lawfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
before he be heard.<note place="margin">Sleid. l. 23.</note> But in this
Councel the Protestants were not allowed
to propose their case, much lesse to defend
it by lawful disputation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">We have not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted our obedience from our lawful Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch.</note> it is objected, and here they
think they have us sure locked up, that we
cannot deny but that the Bishop of Rome
was our Patriarch, and that we have rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
against him, and cast off our Canonical
obedience in our Reformation.</p>
               <p>To this supposed killing argument I give
three clear solutions.</p>
               <p>First, That the <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>itish</hi> Islands neither
were, nor ought to be subject to the Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
of the Roman Patriarch, as hath
been sufficiently demonstrated in my third
conclusion. For all Patriarchal Jurisdiction
being of humane institution, must proceed
either from some Canon or Decree of a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Councel, or of such a Provincial Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
as had power to oblige the <hi>Britons</hi> to
obedience; Or from the grant or concessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of some of their Sovereign Princes, or
from the voluntary submission of a free peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
Or lastly, from custom and prescription.
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:65458:130"/>
If they had any such Canon, or Grant, or
submission, they would quickly produce it;
but we know they cannot. If they plead
custome and prescription immemorial, the
burthen must rest upon them to prove it.
But when they have searched all the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours
over and over who have written of
<hi>British</hi> affaires in those daies, and all their
Records and Registers, they shall not be
able to find any one Act, or so much as any
one footstep, or the least sign of any Roman
Patriarchal Jurisdiction in <hi>Britaigne,</hi> or over
the <hi>Britons</hi> for the first 600 years. And
for after-ages the Roman Bishops neither
held their old Patriarchate, nor gained any
quiet settled possession of their new Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I answer, That Patriarchal
power is not of Divine right, but humane
institution. And therefore may either be
quitted or forfeited, or transferred. And
if ever the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> had any Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchal
Jurisdiction in <hi>Britaigne,</hi> yet they
had both quitted it, and forfeited it over
and over again, and it was lawfully trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred.
To separate from an Ecclesiastical
authority which is disclaimed and disavow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the pretenders to it, and forfeited by
abuse and rebellion, and lawfully transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
is no Schisme.</p>
               <p>First,<note place="margin">The Roman Bishops quitted their Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archate.</note> I say they quitted their pretended
Patriarchal right, when they assumed and
usurped to themselves the name and thing of
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:65458:130"/>
universal Bishops, Spiritual Sovereigns, and
sole Monarchs of the Church, and masters
of all Christians. To be a Patriarch and to
be an universal Bishop in that sense are
inconsistent, and imply a contradiction <hi>in
adjecto;</hi> The one professeth humane, the
other challengeth divine institution. The
one hath a limited Jurisdiction over a certain
Province, the other pretendeth to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited
Jurisdiction over the whole World.
The one is subject to the Canons of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and a meer executour of them, and can
do nothing either against them, or besides
them; The other challengeth an absolute
Sovereignty above the Canons, besides the
Canons, against the Canons, to make them,
to abrogate them, to suspend their influence
by a <hi>non-obsta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>te,</hi> to dispence with them in
such cases wherein the Canon gives no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensative
power, at his own pleasure, when
he will, where he will, to whom he will.
Therefore to claime a power paramount
and Sovereign Monarchical Royalty over
the Church, is implicitely and in effect to
disclaime a Patriarchal Aristocratical dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p>So, <hi>Non tellus cymbam, tellurem cymba reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit:</hi>
It was not we that deserted our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Patriarch, but our pretended Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch
deserted his Patriarchal office. So
long as the Popes contented themselves with
Patriarchal rights, they soared no higher
then to be the executours of the Canons.

When <hi>Acacius</hi> complained that he was
condemned by the sole authority of the
Roman Bishop, without a Synodal sentence,
<hi>Gelssius</hi> the Pope then pleaded for himself,
that <hi>Acacius was not the beginner of a new

General Councels. The authority of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
ceaseth when he renounceth his

Supreme Ecclesiastical power, to which Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchal

with the consent of Sovereign

               </p>
               <p>Against this Supreme Ecclesiastical power
the Popes have not onely rebelled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
but have compelled all Bishops
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:65458:131"/>
under their Jurisdiction to take an oath to
maintain their rebellious usurpations.
When a President of a Province shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell

to usurpe the whole Empire to himself, and
impose new oathes of allegiancc upon his
fellow-subjects, it is not Treason, but Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty
in them to thrust him by the head and
shoulders out of the gates of their City.
When a Steward not imposed upon the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
by the Master, but chosen in trust by
his fellow-servants, during their Masters
absence, shall so far violate his trust, that
he will by force make himself the Master of
the family, and usu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

over his fellowes, but over his Masters
Wife and Children, and oblige his fellow
servants to acknowledge an independent
Sovereign power in him; it is not want of
duty, but fidelity to substract their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
from him.</p>
               <p>This is our case with the Roman Bishops.
They have sought to usurpe a dominion
over the Catholick Church, the spouse of
Christ, and all their fellow-servants. Then
ought not all good Christians to adhere to
the Catholick Church, and desert a schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Patriarch? They have rebelled against
the representative Church, a general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel,
should we involve our selves in their
rebellion and perjury, by swearing to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and make good their usurpations? I
confesse, inferiours are not competent
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:65458:132"/>
Judges of their Superiours. But in this case
of a subordinate Superiour, and in a matter
of Heresie or Schisme already defined by
the Church, the sentence of the Judge is
not necessary, the sentence of the Law, and
the notoreity of the fact are sufficient. It
is not we that judge him, but the Councels
of <hi>Constance</hi> and <hi>Basile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither could our Ancestours hope to
have a General Councel suddenly, whilest
so great a part of Christendom was under
the <hi>Turk;</hi> nor a free Occidental Councel,
whilest the usurper had all Ecclesiasticall
power in his hands. What remained then,
but to reform themselves? According to
the sage advice of <hi>Gerson,</hi>

sickles into every mans harvest. They rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
them of their estates and livelihoods, by
their provisions, and pensions, by their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adjutorships,
and first-fruits, and tenths, by
the vast charge of their investitures, and
palles, and I know not how many other
sorts of exactions, and arbitrary impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
The most ancient of these was the
pall,<note place="margin">Baron. to. 11. An. 1027.</note> whereof our King <hi>Canutus</hi> complained
long since at Rome, and had remedy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised.</p>
               <p>They robbed the Nobility and Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty
many waies, as hath been formerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.
If all these were not a sufficient cause
of forfeiture, certainly abuse did never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
office.</p>
               <p>And though they had sometimes had a
just Patriarchal power,<note place="margin">Patriarchal power was lawfully transferred.</note> and had neither for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited
it by rebellion nor abuse; Yet the
King and the whole body of the Kingdome
by their Legislative power substracting their
obedience from them, and erecting a new
Patriarchate within their own Dominions,
it is a sufficient warrant for all English-men,
to suspend their obedience to the one, and
apply themselves to the other, for the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:65458:133"/>
and tranquillity of the whole body po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick,
as hath before been declared.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">The power which we rejected was not Patriarchal nor Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onical.</note> I answer, that obedience to a
just Patriarch, is of no larger extent then
the Canons of the Fathers do injoyn it. And
since the division of <hi>Britaigne</hi> from the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
no Canons are, or ever were of force
with us, further then they were received, and
by their incorporation became <hi>Britannique</hi>
Lawes. Which as they cannot, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ever
could be imposed upon the King and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
by a forreign Patriarch by constraint,
so when they are found by experience pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall
to the publick good, they may as
freely by the same King and Kingdome be
rejected.</p>
               <p>But I shall wind up this string a little
higher; Suppose that the whole body of
the Canon Law were in force in <hi>England,</hi>
(which it never was) yet neither the Papall
power which we have cashiered, nor any
part of it was ever given to any Patriarch by
the ancient Canons, and by consequence the
separation is not Schismatical, nor any
withdrawing of Canonical obedience. What
power a Metropolitan had over the Bishops
of his own Province by the Canon Law, the
same and no other had a Patriarch over the
Metropolitans and Bishops of sundry Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
within his own Patriarchate. But a
Metropolitan anciently could do nothing
out of his own Diocesse, without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
of the Major part of the Bishops
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:65458:134"/>
of his Province. Nor the Patriarch in like
manner without the advice and consent of
his Metropolitans and Bishops.</p>
               <p>Wherein then consisted Patriarchal au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority?
In ordaining their Metropolitans,
(for with inferiour Bishops they might not
meddle,) or confirming them, or imposing
of hands, in giving the Pall, in convocating
Patriarchal Synods, and presiding in them,
in pronouncing sentence according to the
plurality of voices. (That was when Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>political
Synods did not suffice to determine
some emergent difficulties or differences.)
And lastly, in some few honorary priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
as the acclamation of the Bishops to
them at the latter end of a General Councel,
and the like, which signifie not much. In
all this there is nothing that we dislike or
would seek to have abrogated. Never any
Patriarch was guilty of those exactions, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortions,
incroachments upon the civil rights
of Princes and their Subjects, or upon the
Ecclesiastical rights of Bishops, or of those
provisions, and pensions, and exemptions, and
reservations, and dispensations, and inhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and pardons, and indulgences, and
usurped Sovereignty, which our Reformers
banished out of <hi>England.</hi> And therefore
their separation was not any waies from Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchal
authority.</p>
               <p>I confesse, that by reason of the great
difficulty and charge of convocating so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Bishops, and keeping them so long toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:65458:134"/>
untill all causes were heard and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined;
And by reason of those inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies
which did fall upon their Churches
in their absence, Provincial Councels were
first reduced from twice to once in the year,
and afterwards to once in three years. And
in processe of time the hearing of appeales
and such like causes, and the execution of
the Canons in that behalf, were referred to
Metropolitans, untill the Papacy swallowed
up all the authority of Patriarchs, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitans,
and Bishops. <hi>Serpens serpentem
nisi ederet, non fieret draco.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Peradventure it may be urged in the fourth
place, That <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, who by his
Ministers was the first converter of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
Nation, about the six hundreth year of
our Lord, did thereby acquire to himself and
his Successours a Patriarchal authority and
power over <hi>England</hi> for the future. We do
with all due thankfulnesse to God, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
respect to his memory, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that that blessed Saint was the chief
instrument under God, to hold forth the first
light of saving truth to the English Nation,
who did formerly sit in darknesse and in the
shadow of death, whereby he did more truly
merit the name of <hi>Great,</hi> then by possessing
the chair of Saint <hi>Peter.</hi> And therefore
whilest the sometimes flourishing, now poor
persecuted Church of <hi>England</hi> shall have any
being

But whether this benefit did intitle Saint

of all or any part of the <hi>British</hi> Islands,<note place="margin">

                     </gap>sion of it.</note>
deserves a further consideration.</p>
               <p>First, consider, that at that time, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
this day, half of <hi>Britaigne</hi> it self, and two
third parts of the <hi>Britannique</hi> Islands did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
in the possession of the <hi>Britons,</hi> or <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi>
and <hi>Irish,</hi> who still continued Christians,
and had their Bishops and Protarchs, or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs
of their own, from whom we do
derive in part our Christianity, and holy
orders, and priviledges. Without all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie
the conversion of the Saxons by
Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> could not prejudice the just li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
of them or their Successours.</p>
               <p>Secondly, consider, that the half of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taigne</hi>
which was conquered and possessed
by the <hi>Saxons,</hi> was not soly and altogether
peopled by <hi>Saxons.</hi> A world of <hi>British</hi>
Christians did remain and inhabit among
the Conquerours. For we do not find, either
that the <hi>Saxons</hi> did go about to extirpate
the <hi>British</hi> Nation, or compell them to turn
Renegadoes from their Religion, or so much
as demolish their Churches. But contented
themselves to chase away persons of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency,
and parts, and power, whom they had
reason to suspect and fear: And made use
of vulgar persons, and spirits, for their own
advantage. This is certain, that <hi>Britaigne</hi>
being an Island, whither there is no accesse
by land, all those who were transported, or
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:65458:135"/>
could have been transported by Sea on such
a suddain, could not of themselves alone in
probability of reason, have planted or peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled
the sixth part of so much land as was
really possessed by the <hi>Saxons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore we need not wonder if
Queen <hi>Bertha</hi> a <hi>Gall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ise</hi> and a Christian, did
find a Congregation of Christians at <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi>
to joyn with her in her Religion, and
a Church called Saint <hi>Martins</hi> builded to
her hand;<note place="margin">Bed. l. 1. c. 25.</note> And stood in need of <hi>Lethargus</hi> a
Bishop to order the affaires of Christian
Religion, before ever Saint <hi>Austine</hi> set foot
upon English ground. Neither did the
<hi>British</hi> want their Churches in other places
also, as appears by that Commission which
the King did give to <hi>Austine,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Bed. l. 1. c. 26.</note> (among other
things) to repair the Churches that were
decayed. These poor subdued persons had
as much right to their ancient priviledges, as
the rest of the unconquered <hi>Britons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, consider, That all that part of
<hi>Britaigne</hi> which was both conquered and
inhabited by the <hi>Saxons,</hi> was not one intire
Monarchy, but divided into seven distinct
Kingdoms, which were not so suddenly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
to the Christian faith, all at once, but
in long tract of time, long after Saint <hi>Gregory</hi>
slept with his fathers, upon several occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
by several persons. It was <hi>Kent</hi> and
some few adjacent Counties that was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
by <hi>Austine.</hi> It is true, that <hi>Ethelb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

King of <hi>Kent</hi> after his own conversion, did
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:65458:136"/>
indeavour to have planted the Christian
faith both in the Kingdomes of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland</hi>
and the East Angles, with fair hopes
of good successe for a season. But alas, it
wanted root. Within a short time both
Kings and Kingdoms apostated from Christ,
and forsook their Religion. The Kingdoms
of the <hi>West Saxons</hi> and of the South <hi>Saxons</hi>
under <hi>Kingils</hi> their King,<note place="margin">

by the preaching of <hi>Berinus</hi> an <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi>

was baptized in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion

by whose means Religion took root among
the East Saxons, was converted and christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in <hi>France.</hi> All these Saxons which
were converted by <hi>Britons</hi> or <hi>Scots,</hi> may as
justly plead for their old immunities as the
<hi>Britons</hi> themselves. We acknowledge Saint
<hi>Gregory</hi> to have been the first that did break
the ice. And yet we see how small a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of the inhabitants of the <hi>British</hi>
Islands do owe their conversion to <hi>Rome,</hi> in
probability not a tenth part.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, consider, that the conversion of a
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:65458:136"/>
Nation to the Christian faith, is a good
ground in equity (all other circumstances
concurring,) why they should rather submit
themselves, or a General Councel assign
them to that See that converted them, then
to any other Patriarchate. As was justly
pleaded in the case between the Bishops of
<hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Constantinople,</hi> about the right of
Jurisdiction over the <hi>Bulgarians.</hi> But the
conversion of a Nation is no ground at all
to invest their converter presently with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchal
authority over them, or any Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
superiority, especially where too
great a distance of place doth render such
Jurisdiction uselesse and burthensome. And
most especially where it cannot be done
without prejudice to a former owner, thrust
out of his just right meerly by the power of
the sword, (as the <hi>British</hi> Primates were,)
Or to the subjecting of a free Nation to a
forreign Prelate, without or beyond their
own consent. In probability of reason the
<hi>Britons</hi> ought their first conversion to the
Eastern Church, as appeareth by their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
with them in baptismal rites, and the
observation of Easter; Yet never were
subject to any Eastern Patriarch. Sundry
of our <hi>British</hi> and <hi>English</hi> Bishops have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
forreign Nations, yet never pretended
to any Jurisdiction over them.</p>
               <p>Fifthly and lastly, consider, That whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
title or right S. <hi>Gregory</hi> did acquire, or
might have acquired by his piety and deserts
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:65458:137"/>
towards the English Nation, it was personal,
and could not descend from him to such
Successours, who both forfeited it many
waies, and quickly (within four or five
years) after his death quitted their Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chate,
and set an higher title to a spirituall
Monarchy on foot, whilest the most part of
<hi>England</hi> remained yet <hi>Pagan,</hi> when Pope
<hi>Boniface</hi> did obtain of <hi>Phoeas</hi> the usurper,
(an usurping Pope from an usurping Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour)
to be universal Bishop.</p>
               <p>Their Canon-shot is past, that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
is but a small volly of Muskets. They
adde, that we have schismatically separated
our selves from the Communion of our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestours,
whom we believe to be damned.
That we have separated our selves from our
Ecclesiastical predecessours, by breaking in
sunder the line of Apostolical succession,
whilest our Presbyters did take upon them
to Ordain Bishops, and to propagate to
their Successours more then they received
from their predecessours. That our Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters
are but equivocall Presbyters, want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
both the right matter and form of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterial
ordination. To extinguish the
order is more schismatical, then to decline
their authority. And lastly, that we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
our Episcopal Jurisdiction from the
Crown.</p>
               <p>First, for our natural Fathers, the answer
is easie. We do not condemn them, nor
separate our selves from them; Charity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:65458:137"/>
us both to think well and speak well
of them. But prudence commands us like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
to look well to our selves.<note place="margin">We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn not our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> We believe
our fathers might partake of some errours of
the Roman Church, we do not believe that
they were guilty of any heretical pravity,
but held alwaies the truth implicitely in the
preparation of their minds, and were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
ready to receive it when God should
be pleased to reveal it. Upon these grounds
we are so far from damning them, that we
are confident they were saved by a generall
repentance. He that searcheth carefully into
his own heart, to find out his errours, and
repenteth truly of all his known sins, and
beggeth pardon for his unknown errours,
proceeding out of invincible or but proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ignorance, in Gods acceptation repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
of all. Otherwise the very best of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
were in a miserable condition. For
<hi>who can tell how oft he offendeth?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second accusation of Priests conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crating
Bishops,<note place="margin">Our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops not Ordained by Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note> is grounded upon a sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
fabulous fiction, made by a man of a
leaden heart and a brazen forehead, of I
know not what assembly of some of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers
at the sign of the <hi>Nags-head</hi> in
<hi>Cheapside,</hi> or rather devised by their malicious
enemies at the sign of the <hi>Whetstone</hi> in <hi>Popes-head</hi>-Alley.
Against which lying ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
drowsie dream we produce in the very
point the authentick records of our Church,
of things not acted in a corner, but pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:65458:138"/>
and solemnly, recorded by publick
Notaries,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mason</hi> de Ministerio Anglicano, &amp;c.</note> preserved in publick Registers,
whither every one that desired to see them
might have accesse: And published to the
world in Print whilest there were thousands
of eye-witnesses living, that could have
contradicted them if they had been feigned.
There is no more certainty of the Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, or <hi>Edward</hi> the
sixth, then there is of that Ordination, which
alone they have been pleased to question,
done not by one (as <hi>Austine</hi> consecrated the
first <hi>Saxon</hi> Prelates,) but by five consecrated
Bishops. Let them name the person or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;
And if they were Bishops of the
Church of England, we will shew them the
day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the place, the persons, when and where,
and by whom, and before what publick No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries
or sworn Officers they were ordained.
And this not by uncertain rumours, but by
the Acts and instruments themselves. Let the
Reader chuse whether he will give credit to
a sworn Officer, or a professed adversary;
to eye-witnesses, or to malicious reporters
upon hearsay; to that which is done pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
in the face of the Church, or to that
which is said to be done privately in the
corner of a Tavern.</p>
               <p>These authentick evidences being upon
occasion produced out of our Ecclesiasticall
Courts, and deliberately perused and viewed
by Father <hi>Oldcorn</hi> the Jesuit, he both pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
himself clearly convinced of that
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:65458:138"/>
whereof he had so long doubted, (that was
the legitimate succession of Bishops and
Priests in our Church,) and wished heartily
towards the reparation of the breach of
Christendome, that all the world were so
abundantly satisfied as he himself was. Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
us as partly guilty of the grosse mistake
of many, for not having publickly and time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
made known to the world the notorious
falshood of that empty but far spread asper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
against our succession. As for our
parts, we believe Episcopacy to be at least
in Apostolical institution, approved by
Christ himself in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> ordained in
the infancy of Christianity as a remedy
against Schisme; And we blesse God that
we have a clear succession of it:</p>
               <p>Our matter and form in the Ordination
of Presbyters is imposition of hands;<note place="margin">Our matter and form in Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination justified.</note> And
these words, <hi>Receive the Holy Ghost, whose
sins thou doest forgive, they are forgiven; And
whose sins thou doest retain, they are retained, Be
thou a faithful dispenser of the Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
The form most agreeable to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
practised throughout the Occidentall
Church for a thousand yeares, approved by
the Fathers, and by the most found and
learned Roman Catholicks themselves. The
form of Ordination in the Greek Church is
no more but this, Imposition of hands, and
these words, <hi>The Divine Grace which alwaies
cureth that which is infirm, doth create</hi> [or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote]
<hi>A. B. a venerable sub-Deacon to be a
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:65458:139"/>
Deacon,</hi> or a venerable Deacon to be a Priest,
or a Priest beloved of God to be a Bishop.
And yet no man ever doubted of the validi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of their Ordination, but they did alwaies,
and do at this day execute their functions in
the Roman Church; And discharge all du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
belonging to their respective orders, as
freely as in the Greek Church it self. We
have the same matter that they have, we
have the form more fully then they have,
the Romanists themselves being Judges.
Then what madnesse is it to allow of their
Ordination, and dispute of ours, and upon a
pretended defect in matter or form, to drive
men to be re-ordained. Is not this <hi>to have
the faith of our Lord Iesus Christ in respect of
persons?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These grounds are over-weighty to be
counterbalanced by the tradition of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
and of the chalice. An upstart custom
or innovation, confirmed but the other day
by the decree of <hi>Eugenius</hi> the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.<note place="margin">An. 1439.</note> A time
too late in conscience for introducing either
a double matter and form, or a new matter
and form of that, which is acknowledged by
them, and not denied by us in a larger sense,
to be a Sacrament: All we say is this, That
it is not a Sacrament generally necessary to

are.</p>
               <p>Neither do we draw or derive any spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Jurisdiction from the Crown:<note place="margin">We derive no Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from the Crown.</note> But either
liberty and power to exercise actually and
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:65458:139"/>
lawfully upon the Subjects of the Crown
that habitual Jurisdiction which we received
at our Ordination; Or the inlargement and
dilatation of our Jurisdiction objectively, by
the Princes referring more causes to the
cognisance of the Church then formerly it
had: Or lastly, the increase of it subjective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
by their giving to Ecclesiastical Judges
an external coercive power, which formerly
they had not. To go yet one step higher. In
cases that are indeed spiritual or meerly Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical,
such as concern the doctrine of
faith, or administration of the Sacraments,
or the ordaining or degrading of Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
persons, Sovereign Princes have (and
have only) an Architectonical power, to see
that Clergy-men do their duties in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
places. But this power is alwaies most
properly exercised by the advice and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of Ecclesiastical persons; And some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
necessarily, as in the degradation of
one in holy Orders by Ecclesiastical Dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates.</p>
               <p>Therefore our Law provides, that nothing
shall be judged heresie with us <hi>denovo,</hi> but
by the high Court of Parliament, wherein
our Bishops did alwaies bear a part, with the
assent (that is more then advice) of the
Clergy in their Convocation. In summe, we
hold our benefices from the King, but our
offices from Christ. The King doth nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
us, but Bishops do ordain us. I touch
these things more briefly now, because I
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:65458:140"/>
have handled them more at large in a full
answer to all the objections brought by
<hi>S. N.</hi> Doctour of Theology in the twentieth
Chapter of <hi>the guide of faith,</hi> or the third
part of his Antidote against our holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
our Jurisdiction, and power to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
Scripture. Which if God send op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
may if it be thought convenient
perhaps one day see the light. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding
of those two distinct acts intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by me in this paragraph, that is, <hi>nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
or <hi>election,</hi> with <hi>ordination</hi> or consecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
hath begotten many mistakes in the
world on several sides. Among which the
respect I owe to the <hi>British</hi> Churches will
not permit me to passe by one untouched.</p>
               <p>I have read related,<note place="margin">Blondel. Apolog. p. 368. &amp;c.</note> but confusedly, out of

                  <hi>wherein was one of the principal Monasteries of

ordinantes ad praedicandum miserunt, So the
Colledge ordaining him Bishop sent him to preach.</hi>
As likewise of <hi>Columbanus</hi> his coming into
<hi>Britaigne,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 370.</note> where he had assigned unto him
the Island <hi>Hy</hi> or <hi>Iona,</hi> for the building of a
Monastery. <hi>Habere autem solet ipsa insula
rectorem semper Abbatem Presbyterum, cujus
juri &amp; omnis Provincia, &amp; ipsi etiam Episcopi
ordine inusitato debeant esse subjecti. That Island
used to have a Governour an Abbat a Presbyter,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:65458:140"/>
to whose jurisdiction both the whole Provincee,
and the Bishops themselves by an unusual order
ought to be subject.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 367.</note> These testimonies they
account so clear as to be able to inlighten
the dullest eye. And hence they conclude,
not onely that Presbyters may ordain Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
and be their spiritual Governours,
but that it was <hi>communis quodammod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Anglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
omnium regula,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 371.</note> a common rule of all
the English in a manner, that Bishops being
Monks should be subject to their Abbats.</p>
               <p>I honour <hi>Bede</hi> as the light of his age, who
justly gained to himself the name of Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
throughout the Occidental Church. And
I doubt not but he writ what he heard. But
certainly he could not have such clear di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
knowledge of particular circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
as they who have been upon the place,
and seen the records thereof.</p>
               <p>First, there is a great mistake in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
<hi>Columba</hi> and <hi>Columbanus</hi> lived both in
the same age, but <hi>Columbanus</hi> was much the
younger, who propagated Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
much, but it was in other parts of the
world. It was not <hi>Columbanus</hi> but <hi>Col<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mba</hi>
that converted the <hi>British Scots,</hi> and founded
both the Bishoprick of <hi>Derry</hi> by another
name, and the Abby of <hi>Derry.</hi> And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
the Bishoprick of the Isles in Scotland,
and the Abby of <hi>Iona,</hi> he whom the Irish
call to this day <hi>Columkill, quia multarum cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larum
Pater,</hi> (as his own Scholar gives the
reason in the description of his life,) <hi>because</hi>
                  <pb n="272" facs="tcp:65458:141"/>
he was the Father or founder of many Churches
or Celles.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they confound the places, the
Abby of <hi>Derry</hi> or <hi>Derrimagh, quod lingua
Scotorum significat campum roborum,</hi> (saith
<hi>Bede,) which in Irish</hi> (that was the ancient
Scottish) <hi>signifies a field or plain of Oakes,</hi> which
was indeed situated in the territories of the
Northern <hi>Vlster Scots,</hi> with the Abby of
<hi>Iona</hi> situated in <hi>Britaigne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, they confound the actions, mission
which is no more then nomination or electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
with Ordination or consecration. Who
so proper to chuse a Bishop as the Chapiter?
So was that Convent until the Reformation.
Who so proper to Ordain as the Bishop<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For
neither <hi>Derry</hi> nor the Isles, did ever want a
Bishop from their first conversion. So, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferendo
singula singulis,</hi> the words of <hi>Bede</hi> are
plain, the Chapiter named, and the Bishop
Ordained.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, they mistake the subjection.
The Abbat was the Lord of the Manour, and
so the Bishop was subject to the Abbat <hi>in
temporalibus.</hi> But the Abbat was every
where subject to the Bishop <hi>in spiritualibus,</hi>
who did annually visite both the Abby and
the Abbat, as by the visitation-rolles and
records, (if these intestine wars have not
made an end of them) may appear. You see
upon what conjecturall grounds Criticks
many times build new paradoxes, which one
latent circumstance being known, is able to
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:65458:141"/>
disperse and dissipate, with all their probable
presumptions. If it had not been thus, It is
no new thing for an Abbat to challenge
Episcopal Jurisdiction, or to contend with
his Bishop about it. What is this to meer
Presbyters, <hi>qua tales?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, they contradict Venerable <hi>Bede.</hi>
He saith it was <hi>ordine inusitato, by an unusuall
order.</hi> They say it was <hi>in a manner the common
rule of all the English.</hi> And this they say upon
pretence of a decree of the Councel of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reford,</hi>
that <hi>such Bishops as had voluntarily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
Monkery, should perform their promised
obedience.</hi> Which is altogether impertinent
to their purpose. Doth any man doubt
whether Bishops might freely of their own
accord enter into a religious Order? or that
they were not as well obliged to perform
their vow as others? Some Emperours have
done the same. Yet no man will conclude
from thence, that Emperours are inferiour
to Abbats.</p>
               <p>Such mistakes are all their instances, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
they light by chance upon an unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Church,<note place="margin">Unformed Churches no fit pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident.</note> before it were well settled. As
if a man should argue thus; There have been
no Bishops in <hi>Virginia</hi> during the Reigns of
King <hi>Iames</hi> and King <hi>Charles,</hi> therefore
the Clergy there were Ordained by Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
We know the contrary, that they had
their Ordination in <hi>England.</hi> So had the
Clergy in unformed Churches, forreign Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="274" facs="tcp:65458:142"/>
This is part of that which we have to say
for a proper Patriarchate, and for our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption
from the Jurisdiction of the Roman
Court, from which our separation is much
wider then from the Roman Church. Other
differences may make particular breaches,
but the Roman Court makes the universal
Schisme between them and all the rest of the
Christian world, and hath been much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
of, and in part shaken off by some
of their own communion. I could wish
with all my heart that they were as ready to
quit their pretended prerogatives, which not
we alone, but all the world except them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and a great part of themselves pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately,
so condemn, as we should be to wave
our just priviledges, and if need were to
sacrifice them to the common peace of
Christendome.</p>

with what difficulties poor Exiles struggle,

should write, being chased as Vagabonds
into the mercilesse world to beg relief of

with the like hard measure. Did the King
of <hi>Spain</hi> conqner a Town from the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders?</hi>
He acquired a new Dominion, but the
property of private men continued the same.
Did the <hi>Hollanders</hi> take in a Town from the

               <p>Or if Exiles can subsist without begging,
yet they are necessitated to do or suffer
things otherwise not so agreeable to them.

               <p>When the free exereise of the Roman Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion

Yet by the bounty of forreign Princes, and

And although we cannot hope for that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
assistance which they found, yet might
we have expected a larger supply from home,
by as much as our professours are much more
numerous then theirs were. Hath the sword
devoured up all the charitable <hi>Obadiahs.</hi> in our
Land? Or is there no man that layes the
affliction of <hi>Ioseph</hi> to heart? Yet God that
maintained his people in the Wildernesse with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the ordinary supply of food or rayment,
will not desert us, untill <hi>he turn our captivity as
the rivers in the South.</hi> Where humane help
faileth, Divine begins.</p>
               <p>But to draw to a conclusion: We have seen
in this short Treatlse how the Court of <hi>Rome</hi>
hath been the cause of all the differences and
broiles between the Emperours with other
Christian Princes and States, and the Popes.
We have seen that from the excesses, abuses,
innovations and extortions of that Court, have
sprung all the Schismes of the Eastern and
Western Church, and of the Occidentall
Church within it self. We have heard the
confession of Pope <hi>Adrian,</hi> that <hi>for some yeares
by-past many things to be abominated had been in
that holy See, abuses in spiritual matters, excesses
in commands, and all things out of order.</hi> We have
heard his promise <hi>to endeavour the Reformation
of his own Court, from whence pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="278" facs="tcp:65458:144"/>
the evil did spring, that as corruption did flow from
thence to the inferiour parts, so might health and
Reformation. To which he accounted himself so
much more obliged, by how much he did see the
whole world greedily desire a Reformation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We have viewed the representation which

Rome. These were no Protestants. The first
step to health, is to know the true cause of our
disease.</p>
               <p>It hath been long debated whether the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
and Roman Churches be reconciliable
or not. Far be it from me to make my self a
Judge of that Controversie. Thus much I
have observed, that they who understand the
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:65458:144"/>
sewest controversies make the most, and the
greatest. If questions were truly stated by
moderate persons, both the number and the
height would be much abated. Many diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
are grounded upon mistakes of one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others
sense. Many are meer logomachies or
contentions about words. Many are meerly
Scholastical above the capacity and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of ordinary brains. And many doubtlesse
are real both in <hi>credendis</hi> and <hi>agendis,</hi> both in
doctrine and discipline. But whether the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
be so great, or how far any of these
are necessary to salvation, or do intrench upon
the fundamentals of Religion, requires a seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
judicious, and impartial consideration.
There is great difference between the reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation
of the persons, and the reconciliation
of the opinions. Men may vary in their
judgments, And yet preserve Christian unity
and charity in their affections, one towards
another, so as the errours be not destructive to
fundamental Articles.</p>
               <p>I determine nothing, but onely crave leave
to propose a question to all moderate Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
who love the peace of the Church, and
