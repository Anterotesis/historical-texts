         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Should be too unreasonable, by a
tedious Epistle, to divert you
from those more weighty and serious
Affairs wherein the greatest and most
Eminent <hi>Wits</hi> of the Nation have
<pb facs="tcp:54222:3"/>
thought you worthy to be employ'd,
but that I find a mean nonsensical
<hi>Preface</hi> over a Glass of Wine, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Purging or Blooding, is not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to Commend so <hi>Illaborate</hi> a
Piece, without a <hi>Dedication.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not that I am so much an <hi>Ape</hi>
to follow the Fashion for any <hi>Fools</hi>
humonr, tho' it has been done long
before me in the <hi>State of Ignorance,</hi>
or, as the Author calls it, <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,</hi>
or that I am affected with a
gaudy <hi>Frontispiece</hi> to a mean <hi>Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
like a <hi>Close-stool</hi> with a <hi>Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet
<pb facs="tcp:54222:3"/>
Seat</hi> larger than the <hi>Pan</hi> that
receives the Excrement, or a gawdy
<hi>Miss</hi> in fine Cloaths, whose Out-side
is of greater value with the <hi>Brokers</hi>
than the whole Body: But that I
doubt so inconsiderable a piece of
<hi>Paper-work</hi> against the loud, robu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stious
<hi>Wits,</hi> will hardly be able to
withstand the Storm without a Snp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porter.</p>
            <p>And since I must have a Patron,
to whom can I better Address my
self than to one who for his singular
Endowments and Eminent Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,

is not only of sufficient Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
himself, but hath (as he just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
merits) the whole Strength of
the Nation for his Support.</p>
            <p>Besides, were I not obliged, on
the account of your extraordinary
Bounty, who have from time to time
so plentifully stored me with all the
<hi>Rubbish</hi> of the Age, to give you
the Tribute of my mean <hi>Talent,</hi> I
ought in Civility to beg your <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>

            <head>THE
PREFACE
TO
OVID'S EPISTLES.</head>
            <p>THese Epistles of <hi>Ovid</hi> being so E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legantly
Translated by the most
Eminent wits of the Times, I
will not presume so far upon my self, to think
I can in a mean Burlesque add any thing
to their vast Vndertakings.</p>
            <q>Purpureus latè qui splendeat, &amp;c.
as Horace sayes.</q>
            <p>Nor will I trouble your Head or mine, to
know whether this great <hi>Atlas</hi> in Poetry
was banisht for the lasciviousness of his
Rhimes, or his Debauching the Emperour's
Daughter; whether by <hi>Corinna,</hi> was meant
<hi>Julia,</hi> or by <hi>Julia Corinna,</hi> of both, or nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<q>
                  <pb facs="tcp:54222:6"/>Nec flocci facio.</q>
This I dare with my Author affirm, That
he was a Gentleman of an antient Family,
and had a pretty splendid Fortune; and
whether he was designed for the Study of the
Law or Gospel, I cannot tell: but this I
dare presume to say, he was as smart a Wit,
and as good a Poet, as He or I, or the very
best of his Translators.
<q>Nescivit quod bene cessit.</q>
And though he had many Contemporaries,
and notable Rhimes in his own time, yet I
cannot in all the Catalogue of <hi>Virgil, Catul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,
Tibullus, or Propertius,</hi> find, that ever
he made Vse of Club-wit, to help him out
in his Epistles.
<q>O Tempora! O mores!</q>
Yet, in our Polite Age, it makes me wonder
that so many able Workmen should joyn their
Shreds and Thrums <hi>together,</hi> to dress him
up in a Buffoons Coat, when I really con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
(and I question not but there are
more Fools in the World of my Opinion)
that I in my own simple naked shape, come
<pb facs="tcp:54222:6"/>
nearer the Original than the best on 'em.</p>
            <q>Quo simplicius, &amp;c.</q>
            <p>But why Burlesque, an old-fashioned,
short-wasted, crop-skirted Fustian Ierkin,
when long Robes is all the Mode? It is a
plaguy thing to be out of the fashion.
<q>Pauper Aristoteles cogitur ire pedes.</q>
But needs must when the Devil drives.
<q>Praestat otiosum esse quam nihil agere.</q>
Well, were I a <hi>M.</hi> or a Sir <hi>C.</hi> for half their
number of Acres in good English ground,
I wou'd quit all my Title to <hi>Parnassus,</hi> and
engage never to write Burlesque; nay, not
any thing else while I liv'd.
<q>Cedant Arma Togae.</q>
Who had not rather be an Ass and an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derman,
than a Wit and a Beggar; and
had not rather hear the gingling of Guin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys,
than the ratling of Rhimes? 'tis bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Harmony: and thirty Foot in <hi>London</hi>
well improv'd, is a better sight, and yields
more Interest <hi>per annum,</hi> than forty Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks
of Heroick.
<q>
                  <pb facs="tcp:54222:7"/>O fortunati nimium!</q>
But every one to his Trade.
<q>Nemo sine Crimine vivit.</q>
I must confess, as they splay'd the Author
before, I have gelt them: and why not?
if these Brothers of a Mystery joyn together
to clip the Kings English, because it comes
first through their hands; and it fall next
into my clutches, shall I not come in for a
snack?</p>
            <p>I put no Silver Plate upon a Copper
stamp; nor do I set my Rubies in Gold and
inamelling, to make them pass for Diamonds,
but shew the down-right brazen-fac'd naked
truth of the matter. Nor am I half so guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Clipping as my Masters.
<q>Plura desunt.</q>
Of twenty four Epistlès of the Primitive
Author, there are but twenty three left re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining,
an those so mangled and torn,
and mis-placed from the decent Symmetry
of Parts and Order they preserved for above
Seventeen hundred years, that you can
neither make Back nor Breast, Head nor
Tail of 'em.
<q>
                  <pb facs="tcp:54222:7"/>Tempora mutantur.</q>
For my part, I observe the Method of my
Translators; and if I have omitted any thing
that was proper for my purpose, it was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
because the Subject wou'd not admit
of Burlesque, or because it was done to my
hand.
<q>Telam texunt &amp; retexunt.</q>
Yet you will say it was a bold attempt, for a
Pigmy <hi>Travestie</hi> to take up the Cudgels
against those mighty Giants in Heroick;
so many <hi>Briareus</hi>'s hands joyn'd against
me, when I had not one Friend in the
whole World to stick by me, to clap in a
finger for a Preface, having scarce allow'd
me a fortnights time for the Doing; as it
was manifest to some Persons of Repute
and Quality, who very well knew with
what Expedition it was run off, and hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
into the Press, before I had time to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruse
the Copies.</p>
            <p>But I do not hope to extenuate my faults
by an Elaborate Epistle, or an insinuating
Preface, so much Exploded amongst the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Sages: neither do I know the Vse or
<pb facs="tcp:54222:8"/>
necessity of troubling you with them, but that
I would not be out of the Fashion.

I cou'd convince you out of the <hi>Caldean,

Lest then I should be thought more Affected

I submit to thy Censure, and conclude with

                  <hi>Demophon,</hi> who was Son to <hi>Theseus</hi> and <hi>Phaedra,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
from the <hi>Trojan</hi> War into his own Country, was
by a Tempest driven upon the Coasts of <hi>Thrace,</hi> where
<hi>Phillis,</hi> who was the Queen of <hi>Thrace,</hi> entertain'd him,
and married him. When he had stayed with her some
time, he heard that <hi>Menestheus</hi> was dead; who after he
had conquered <hi>Theseus,</hi> had usurpt the Government of
Athens: and under Pretence of setling his own Affairs,
he went to Athens, and promised the Queen that he would
come back again in a Moneth. When he had been gone
four Moneths, and that she had heard no News of him,
she writes him this Letter.</p>

            <l>I clapt my hand upon my Bum,</l>
            <l>And every blast I cry'd, he's come.</l>
            <l>Nay still I found some new pretences</l>

            <l>And nothing else, except your stick</l>

            <l>Hunting and hawking, and the same;</l>

Or with my Nurse sit down complaining on't,</l>

            </argument>
            <l>AFter my hearty Commendation,</l>
            <l>Thy <hi>Laodam</hi> sends Gratulation.</l>
            <l>The scolding storms that scar'd thee from me,</l>

            <l>In hast thou throng'd to be a Warrier,</l>
            <l>But thou't return with <hi>Long</hi> the Carrier.</l>
            <l>So raging mad I was to see thee,</l>
            <l>I cou'd not frame to say, God b'w'ye.</l>
            <l>A merry gale in stern abaft her,</l>
            <l>And oft I cry'd, Fair weather after.</l>

I lookt and lookt, till by this Light,</l>

            <l>Then did such fits o'th' sudden hold me,</l>
            <l>That I was ready to befoul me.</l>
            <l>My Sire and Dam griev'd at the Mischance,</l>

            <l>With water and some Rags they threw,</l>
            <l>They made me clean with much ado.</l>
            <l>They meant it well, but had been kinder,</l>
            <l>To leave me here to the Gold-finder.</l>
            <l>My Bowels grumble, down I sit,</l>

            <l>About my Ears, I know not how.</l>
            <l>Thus I run staggering round about,</l>
            <l>Like one of <hi>Pem</hi>—drunken Rout.</l>
            <l>Put on, put on, your Gown and Mantue,</l>
            <l>My Neighbours cry, the Gossips want you.</l>
            <l>Alas! you may go dress, talk bawdy,</l>

               <hi>Hector</hi> I fear, that blundering <hi>Hector,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Of Limbs they say, a great Dissector,</l>

            <l>Abroad, can do no grace at home.</l>
            <l>To let thee go, by what the Wizard</l>

first to chide him for his presumption in writing, as
he had done, which cou'd only proceed from his low
opinion of her virtue. Then owns her self to be sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of the Passion which he had expressed for her,
tho' she much suspect his Constancy, and at last dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers
her inclinations to be favourable to him. The
whole Letter shewing the Extream Artifice of Woman-kind.</p>

               <head>The ARGUMENT.</head>
               <p>The Rape of <hi>Helen,</hi> having carried all the Grecian Princes
to the Siege of <hi>Troy. Ulysses,</hi> among the rest there
signalliz'd his manhood and prudence particularly. But
the Siege at an end, and he not returning with the other
Captains, <hi>Penelope</hi> sends this Letter in Quest of him.
She had render'd her self as deservedly famous on her
part, by resisting all the while the importunity of her
Suitors, with an unusual Constancy and Fidelity. She
complains to <hi>Ulysses</hi> of their Carriage, she likewise tells
him her apprehensions and fears for him during the War,
and since acquaints him with the ill posture of his Family
through his absence, and desires him to hasten home, as the
only means to set all right again.</p>

               <head>The ARGUMENT.</head>
               <p>The Desire of gaining the Golden Fleece put <hi>Jason</hi> upon
a Voyage to <hi>Cholcos.</hi> In his Passage he stopt at the
Island <hi>Lemnos;</hi> of which place <hi>Hypsipyle</hi> was then
Queen, famed for her pious saving of her Father <hi>Thoas,</hi>
in a general Massacre of the men there by the Women of
that Country. Her Entertainment of <hi>Jason</hi> so kind as
induced him to stay there two years, at the end of which
he left the Island, and the Queen (then big with Child)
and after a thousand vows of Constancy and a speedy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
persues his first intended Voyage, and arrives at
<hi>Cholcos,</hi> where <hi>Aeta</hi> was king. <hi>Medea</hi> his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
falls deeply in Love with <hi>Jason,</hi> and by her Charms
be gain'd the Golden Fleece, with which and <hi>Medea</hi> he
secretly sail'd home to <hi>Thessaly. Hypsipyle</hi> hearing of
his Landing with her more happy Rival <hi>Medea,</hi> writes
him this Epistle.</p>

Son <hi>Ascanius</hi> from the Fire, put to Sea with twenty
Sail of Ships, and having been long toss'd with Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pests,

Queen <hi>Dido</hi> (flying from the Cruelty of <hi>Pigmalion</hi>
her Brother, who had killed her Husband <hi>Sicheas</hi>) had
lately built <hi>Carthage.</hi> She entertained <hi>Aeneas</hi> and his

him, and in the end denied him not the last Favours.

(a Kingdom promised to him by the Gods) be readily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to obey him. <hi>Dido</hi> soon perceived it, and having in

in despair writes to him as follows.</p>

               <head>The ARGUMENT.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Acontius</hi> in the Temple of Diana at Delos (famous for
the resort of the most Beautiful Virgins of all <hi>Greece</hi>)
fell in Love with <hi>Cydippe,</hi> a Lady of Quality much
above his own; not daring therefore to court her openly, he
found this Device to obtain her: He writes upon the fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Apple that cou'd be procured, a Couple of Verses to this
Effect.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>I swear by chast <hi>Diana</hi> I will be</l>
                  <l>In sacred Wedlock ever joyn'd to thee.</l>
               </q>
               <p>And throws it at the feet of the young Lady. She suspecting
not the Deceit takes it up, and reads it, and therein
promises her self in Marriage to <hi>Acontius,</hi> there being a
Law there in force, that whatever any person shou'd swear
in the Temple of <hi>Diana</hi> of <hi>Delos,</hi> should stand good and
be inviolably observed. But her Father not knowing what
had past, and having not long after promis'd her to another,
just as the Solemnities of Marriage were to be performed,
she was taken with a sudden and violent Fever, which
<hi>Acontius,</hi> endeavours to perswade her was sent from
<hi>Diana</hi> as a Punishment of the Breach of the Vow made in
her Presence. And this with the rest of the Arguments
which on such an Occasion wou'd occur to Lovers, is the
subject of the following Epistle.</p>

            <l>Now Lad, thou woud'st repent my swearing</l>
            <l>And hardly think me worth thy wearing.</l>
            <l>To <hi>Delos</hi> then wou'd hast to ease thee</l>
            <l>And beg the Goddess to release thee.</l>
            <l>Or in thy Cranny keep a puther</l>
            <l>By new Oaths to outswear the other.</l>

            </l>
            <l>And still I have my wonted Fits.</l>
            <l>We ask the Wiseman, he replying,</l>
            <l>Can any better come of Lying?</l>
            <l>The Gods are on thy side; in thee</l>
            <l>To be so kind what can they see?</l>
            <l>But so it is—and I must buckle,</l>
            <l>Under thy Foot-stool for to truckle.</l>
            <l>Since 'tis my Fate thou must be mine,</l>
            <l>I'l say no more but I am thine.</l>

My Mother now does understand me,</l>
            <l>How with an Apple you trapan'd me.</l>
            <l>What I have said in this Condition,</l>
            <l>I fear I've gone beyond Commission,</l>
            <l>And said already more to thee,</l>
            <l>Than what becomes my Modesty.</l>
            <l>But lately since I took my potion,</l>
            <l>And now I find a sudden Motion.</l>
            <l>Be true, and set thy heart at rest,</l>
            <l>I'll say no more, few words are best.</l>
