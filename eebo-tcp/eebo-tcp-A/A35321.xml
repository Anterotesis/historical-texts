            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>From Spanish Novel, or from French Romance;</l>
            <l>Nor shall we charm your Ears, or feast your Eyes</l>
            <l>With Turkey-Works, or Indian Rarityes:</l>
            <l>But to plain <hi>Hollinshead</hi> and down-right <hi>Stow</hi>
            </l>
            <l>We the coarse Web of our Contrivance owe.</l>
            <l>Since Laces, Ribbands, and such Modish geer</l>
            <l>Fetcht from abroad are now forbidden here,</l>
            <l>Amongst those Forreign Toys (for ought we know)</l>

               <hi>Greece,</hi> the first Mistress of the Tragick Muse,</l>
            <l>To grace her Stage, did her own Heroes chuse;</l>
            <l>Their Pens adorn'd their Native Swords; and thus</l>
            <l>What was not <hi>Grecian</hi> past for Barbarous.</l>
            <l>On us our Country the same duty lays,</l>
            <l>And English Wit should English Valour raise.</l>
            <l>Why should our Land to any Land submit</l>
            <l>In choice of Heroes, or in height of Wit?</l>
            <l>This made him write, who never writ till now,</l>
            <l>Only to shew what better Pens should do.</l>
            <l>And for his Pains he hopes he shall be thought</l>

            <l>
               <hi>RIchard</hi> is dead; and now begins your Reign:</l>
            <l>Let not the Tyrant live in you again.</l>
            <l>For though one Tyrant be a Nation's Curse,</l>
            <l>Yet Commonwealths of Tyrants are much worse:</l>
            <l>Their Name is Legion; And a <hi>Rump</hi> (you know)</l>
            <l>In Cruelty all <hi>Richards</hi> does outgo.</l>
            <l>First then by Acts of Grace your Power declare:</l>
            <l>Newly install'd, all Princes gracious are;</l>
            <l>All lesser Crimes within their Pardon fall;</l>
            <l>And PoÃ«ts Sins are not held Capital.</l>
            <l>For your own sake you must some Mercy shew:</l>
            <l>Act not the Tyrant's Part, lest we act you.</l>
            <l>A formal Critick with his wise Grimace</l>
            <l>Will on the Stage appear with no ill grace:</l>
            <l>Most of that Trade in this Censorious Age</l>
            <l>Have little of the PoÃ«t, but his Rage:</l>
            <l>Perhaps old <hi>Johnson</hi>'s Gall may fill their Pen;</l>
            <l>But where's the Iudgment, and the Salt of <hi>Ben?</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Yet for himself our Authour does declare</l>
            <l>All that sit here, his Lawful Iudges are:</l>
            <l>For 'tis but just, that in our lawless days,</l>
            <l>Since all Men write, all Men should judge of Plays.</l>
