         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE occasion of this daies solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity hath beene long and well known, and we have often in this place spoken of it; and it were a thing not unseasonable for the day, to set out in its lively colours that facino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous act, which will scarcely bee credible to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:17825:10"/>
posterity, it exceeds my conceit to set it out in the right colours: I have therefore taken a text tending that way, and serving for our present purpose.</p>
                  <p>It pleaseth our blessed Saviour out of his love to his Church, not only to give directions what to doe, and what not to doe, what to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and what not to believe, but to foretell likewise al future calamities, that so the Church might be fore-armed, and might not be surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with terror upon the sight of some sudden or strange accident; as especially the flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing estate of Antichrist: Hee therefore fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels all, both the beginning, the growth, the strength, the proceeding, and at last the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of that Man of Sin.</p>
                  <p>The Church in this world is alwayes under some prophesie, it is alwayes under somewhat that is unfulfilled; for untill wee come to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven there is not an accomplishment of all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies.</p>
                  <p>This Booke is a setting downe of prophesies of future events to the end of the world.</p>
                  <p>This Chapter sets out in lively colours the state of the Pontificality, the state of Rome, under the Bishop of Rome, the Pope: and not the state of Rome under the Heathen Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours. It sets downe likewise the judgement of God in this life upon this Beast, and upon the Whore that sits upon the Beast.</p>
                  <p>The description is large in the former part of the Chapter, it would take up a great deale of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:17825:10"/>
time to unfold that; but because I have divers other things to speake of, I will passe that by.</p>
                  <p>The judgement of God upon the Beast and Whore, is set downe partly in the verse before the Text: <hi>The ten Hornes which thou sawest upon the Beast shall hate the Whore, and make her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burne her with fire, for God hath put into their hearts to fulfill his will, and to agree to give up their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes to the Beast, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here the Iudgement is set downe, what it is, and by whom it shall be, by the ten Hornes; that is, the ten Kings; and secondly, what they shall doe, and that is set downe in order.</p>
                  <p>First, these ten Hornes, these ten Kings, Western Kings, <hi>They shall hate the Whore.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hatred is the beginning of all actions that are offensive; for it is the strongest, and stiffest affection of ill, as love is the strongest of good affections, <hi>They shall hate the Whore:</hi> It is not only anger, but hatred.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They shall make her desolate and naked;</hi> that is the second degree, they shall leave her, they shall strip this Strumpet of her ornaments and strength, whereby she set out her selfe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They shall eat her flesh,</hi> that's the third; that is what they have given her before to inrich her, withall, that which made her in such well li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, that which commended her, that wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ch is her living, the riches of the Popes Clergie gotten (most of it) by ill meanes they shall take from her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:17825:11"/>
But that is not all, but there is a higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree then all this, <hi>They shall burne the Whore with fire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that in the foregoing verse you see is set downe what the Iudgement is, and who shall bthe Executioners of this judgement.</p>
                  <p>But why must all this come to passe? Hee riseth to the highest cause: <hi>God hath put into their hearts to fulfill his will, and to agree with one consent to give their kingdomes to the Beast:</hi> God afterwards put into their minds to hate the Beast.</p>
                  <p>So that in this verse is the severity, and the mercy of God, his justice and his goodnesse: His severity in putting into the hearts of these Kings to agree with one consent, to give up their kingdomes to the Beast. A great Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment so to besot them: but here is a limitation of that severity at last, till the time come, untill the Word of God shall bee fulfilled; that is, untill they shall cease to be thus deluded by the Bishop of Rome, and then they shall begin to hate the Whore, as much as ever they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded by her, <hi>and shall eate her flesh, and consume her with Fire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the explication of these words, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing somewhat hard, I will spend a little time to unfold them. And first I must shew who is this Beast.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For God hath put into their hearts to fulfill his will, and to agree to give up their Kingdomes to the Beast.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:17825:11"/>
The Beast is mentioned in three places in the Revelation, in the ninth Chapter there is mention of the Beast comming out of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomlesse Pit; and in the 13. of the Beast that rose out of the Sea; and here in this 17. of a scarlet coloured Beast, having seven heads and ten hornes.</p>
                  <p>The Beast (in a word) is the state of Rome, sometime under the heathenish Emperours, sometime under the Pontificality: the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is, whether the Beast here spoken of bee the state of Rome, under the Roman persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Emperours before Christianity prevailed much, or the state of Rome under the usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Bishop of Rome?</p>
                  <p>I answer, undoubtedly it is here meant of the state of Rome as it is upheld, the Whore. The Beast, that Beast: For it is meant here of one that seduced by lying miracles, of one that should come in a mysterie, of one that should deale with fornication, and such cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</p>
                  <p>Now heathenish Rome it overcame men by violence, and by force, and not by whorish insinuations, by drawing them on to Idolatry: It is said in the fifth verse, that upon her fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head was a name written, <hi>Mysterie, Babylon the great, Mother of Harlots: Babylon in a Mysterie,</hi> and this <hi>Mysterie</hi> is a great word too with them: the <hi>Mysterie</hi> of the Masse, in every thing there is a <hi>Mysterie,</hi> all their Ceremonies are <hi>Mysteries:</hi> This word <hi>Mysterie</hi> therefore in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:17825:12"/>
the fore-head of the Whore, sheweth what Beast it is, that is here meant.</p>
                  <p>It is observed by divers Writers, that in the Frontlet of the Popes Diadem, there is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten this name, <hi>Mysterium,</hi> as in <hi>Iulius</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds time; but afterwards when they smelt that he was construed thereby, to be the very Whore, they rased out that, and put in <hi>Iulius secundus, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And she sits upon many waters, She sits,</hi> marke, the Spirit of God will not suffer us to erre: what is the regiment of the Pope called, Sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting? such a Pope sate so long, the Whore sits in the very phrase, and what is the seat cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led? the See of Rome, the See of Antichrist: Divers other particular things there are to shew that he means Rome; that is, the state of Rome under the Bishop of Rome to bee the Beast here spoken of.</p>
                  <p>Especially considering the connexion of this Chapter with that following, where is set down the finall destruction of this Beast: now wee know that heathenish Rome ended long agoe; therefore that Beast which is here meant must needs bee that which followes in the next Chapter, and therefore it must needs be Rome, as it is under the Bishop, the Pope of Rome.</p>
                  <p>It is said in the 13. Chapter, that this Beast made the former Beast to speake, did enliven and quicken the former Beast; so indeed this Beast, Rome considered under the Pope, which
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:17825:12"/>
succeeds that Beast, Rome as it was under the Roman Emperours, quickens the former Beast: for now all is as glorious as ever it was in heathenish Rome: For after that the Gothes and Vandals had possessed Rome, the Pope put some life into the Empire of Rome, and did himselfe become Emperour. For indeed the Emperour of Germany, though he be inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled King of Rome, yet that is but a meer ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tular thing, the Eagle is deplumed of her fea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, of her authority; it is only the title hee beares: And if any Emperour come to Rome, the Pope will make him sweare fealty, and hee must not long stay in Rome, he cannot endure that.</p>
                  <p>And it is well said in the Revelation, that this Beast is the Image of the former Beast, for the Pope is altogether like the Emperours, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most in every thing. For the Emperours were crowned: The Pope for failing hath three Crownes: The Emperours had their scarlet: this is a purple coloured VVhore in scarlet; They spake the Latine tongue, and forced all nations almost to speak Latine, as a monument of their slavery. So all in the Popish Church is in latine, their prayers in Latine, all in latine, even for the simple and sottish people to use. Ancient heathen Rome had their grave Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; the Pope hath his Cardinals. The hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Emperours, as <hi>Domitian</hi> and others would be adored as Gods: So likewise is the Pope of Rome adored, and marke the slight; hee
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:17825:13"/>
hath a Crucifix upon his feet, and Kings must kisse that, &amp; so with adoring of the Cross they adore his person, as they did <hi>Heliodorus,</hi> that heathen Emperour. Thus in every thing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most they agree with ancient Rome, and in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other things I might runne over their like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to the former Beast.</p>
                  <p>Now this Beast (to describe him a little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that we might know what these Kings did, when they gave up their Kingdomes and Thrones to the Beast.) It is said in the 13. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that the Dragon gave power to the Beast: the Dragon is the Devill; and as he wrought effectually in the former Beast in heathen Rome, to make war with the Saints, so is this Beast, Pontificall Rome stirred up, and acted by the Devill, the Dragon to persecute the Church: So that this Beast hath the power, and the spirit of the Dragon, the Devill him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</p>
                  <p>And that you may discerne that I doe them no wrong, consider how the Dragon, and this Beast (which is moved, and lead, and acted by the spirit of the Dragon) agree in their cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. I will name two or three to you.</p>
                  <p>The Dragons course is to make us distrust God; you know how in Paradise hee taught our first Parents to distrust the word of God, <hi>Yee shall be as Gods, knowing good and evill.</hi> So the force of Popery is to dishonour, and to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit Gods truth, to put out the peoples eyes, to lead them blind-fold, to make the Scripture
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:17825:13"/>
a matter of errour and heresie, and bid the people take heed of it; as if God meant to deceive them, to goe beyond them in giving them his Word; as though it were not a word of salvation. As the Dragon himselfe said to Christ, <hi>If thou wilt fall downe and worship me, all these will I give thee:</hi> So the Pope takes upon him the Dragons power, these that will bee good sonnes of their Church, these and these preferments will he give them, when hee hath as much right to them as the Devill had to those.</p>
                  <p>The Devill fell from heaven at the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word, at the preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell; the Apostles when they returned from preaching, told our Saviour that they saw Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than fall downe like lightning. So Antichrist fals by the preaching of the Gospel, by the breath of the Lords mouth, he is not able to stand before it no more then <hi>Dagon</hi> before the Arke; the VVord preached is as fire to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume him, so he is like the Dragon in that.</p>
                  <p>In disposition he is like the Dragon: The Devill is a Lyer and a Murtherer from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, the father of lies; so likewise the Pope is a Lyar, all Popery is nothing but lies; therefore 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. it is said, <hi>They are given over to beleeve lies,</hi> Popery is a grand lie, it is a lie in the primacie,; for it came in by forgery and intrusion, it is a lie in Purgatory, which is a meere conceit; it is a lie in their miracles, which they have devised to maintaine their
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:17825:14"/>
false worship with; It is a lie in their works of supererogation, that they can fulfill more then the Law requireth. So that all Popery consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it distinctly from our Religion (because they have that which wee have, and some pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of their owne) consider it by it selfe, it is a meer lie.</p>
                  <p>Besides that, they maintaine the doctrine of Equivocation, which is a lie, a justifier of lies, which is worst of all.</p>
                  <p>And to murther; this present day and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion tels us that murthers come from them, their Doctrine maintaines it, and they make orations in commendations of Traytors, as <hi>Sixtus Quintus</hi> did in praise of him, that killed <hi>Henry</hi> the third, King of <hi>France,</hi> and the bloody Massacre of <hi>France</hi> is pictured up in the Popes Court: As the Devill is a Lyar and a Murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, so is this Sonne of the Devill, who is led by the Spirit of the Dragon, in disposition they are alike.</p>
                  <p>In course of life they are alike. The Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon is said to draw the third part of the stars of heaven downe to the earth; that is, to draw men which were as the stars of heaven, to make them deny their Religion. So this Dragon, this Pope, the instrument and vassal of Sathan, hee drawes the third part of the stars from heaven, and hee drawes men from the love of the truth by preferment and honour, men that are learned, men that are otherwise of excellent parts, hee drawes them from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:17825:14"/>
to earth; that is, hee drawes them from the knowledge of the truth and goodnesse to earth, and lower then earth too if they do not repent, even to hell it selfe from whence hee came. Thus I might goe on to shew that this Beast is Rome under the Pontificality, and not Rome under the Heathen Emperours: like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise that this Beast is acted, lead, and guided by the spirit of the Dragon, by reason of the resemblance which it holds parallel with him in these and other things. So much for explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Beast.</p>
                  <p>But why is the state of Rome called the Beast?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Daniel</hi> first knew the great Empires, the one of <hi>Babylon,</hi> called a Lyon, the Persian Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, a Bear, the Grecian a Leopard; but here in this Chapter is a strange Beast, that hath all the cruelty and fiercenesse of all those Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies: Called therefore a Beast for her fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and cruelty.</p>
                  <p>Gods Church they are sheepe and lambes, Christ himselfe the Lambe of God, the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site Church of Antichrist, a Beast, acruel Beast. If you go to plants, Gods Church are lilies, the opposite kingdome are thornes. If you goe to Fowles, Gods Church are Doves, Turtles, mild and gentle, the opposite Church are Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles and birds of prey.</p>
                  <p>But I say they are called Beasts, for their cruelty: The state of Rome under those heathenish Emperours was a Beast, and in
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:17825:15"/>
those ten persecutions the Emperours are rightly called Beasts; so likewise <hi>Rome</hi> Papall is a Beast. Our Religion, true Religion enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained makes of Beasts men, the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Christ alters their natures, turnes Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons into Lambes, as the Prophet saith, <hi>Isa.</hi> 11. But the Popish religion, it makes of men beasts, makes them worse then themselves: For these Gun powder-traytors, many of them as they were by birth Gentlemen, so their dispositions were gentle and mild, divers of them, not of the worst dispositions, only that bloody Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion made them worse then their nature was: So I say Papall Rome is a Beast, and popish re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion makes men beasts.</p>
                  <p>Well, I will not inlarge my selfe in the uses of this point, because I shall speake of it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, if the time will give me leave, only this, have nothing to doe with this Beast, keep out of her pawes, keepe out of her clawes: A Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or a cruell Beast may seeme to bee calme for a while, but a Lyon will (as we say) shew a Lyons trick once a yeare. Meddle not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with this Beast, it is a Beast; so much for that, what the Beast is, the state of Rome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Bishop of Rome.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>For God hath put into their hearts to fulfill his will, and to agree to give up their kingdomes to the Beast.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whose? The Angell sets down in the verse before, <hi>the ten Horns, the ten Kings; the ten western</hi>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:17825:15"/>
                     <hi>Kings,</hi> whether it be a certaine number for an uncertain, or whether it be a certain number, I wil not dispute of now, but take it so as it cannot be disputed against, a certain number for an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine: A number of the VVesterne Kings gave up their kingdomes for a while to the Beast, untill the Word of God should bee ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled.</p>
                  <p>But marke the phrase, <hi>God put it into their hearts to give up their kingdomes to the Beast.</hi> Wil God put into their hearts to give up their kingdomes to the Beast? why then the Pope of Rome need not pretend <hi>Constantines</hi> dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he 300. yeares after Christ gave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them many territories about Rome: But they may depend upon a higher donation, <hi>God put it into the hearts of the Kings to give up their kingdomes to the Beast:</hi> Here is a higher title then the donation of <hi>Constantine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But we must know that this is not meant, as if God gave him a right, by putting into the hearts of the Kings to give up their kingdomes to the Beast: but God seeing these ten Hornes, these ten Kings to be in a sinfull estate, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served to be left of him, and to bee given up to further illusion, and by with-drawing his grace to give them up to the occasions of sin, to this seducing Beast and Whore, he put into their hearts to give up their kingdomes to the Beast.</p>
                  <p>But this must be a little cleared. Is God the Author of sinne? <hi>God put it into their hearts,</hi> he
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:17825:16"/>
did not only rule the events, <hi>but he put into their hearts, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I answer: The phrases of the Scripture are well enough knowne in this kind. <hi>God gave them up to a reprobate sense, Rom.</hi> 1. 12. The fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the people from <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> it is said, it was of the Lord; And God bad <hi>Shemei</hi> rayle, divers such phrases there are in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: How must these bee understood? thus. Not that God doth allow or command any thing that is evill, much lesse that hee doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse any evill into men, so that, when it is said he put these things into their hearts, here is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an outward command, nor an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward infusion; what is it then? Here is a fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of them in an evill and sinfull estate, and God useth that evil and mischiefe, and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse that he finds to his owne end, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, He infuseth no malice or evil, but finding of it he useth it to his owne particular end and purpose, &amp; makes way and vent for it upon par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular occasions. These ten Kings, he infuseth no love of superstition into them, but finding them evill, and not as they should be Subjects of his kingdome, and misliking his sweet go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, it was just with God to give them up to be slaves to the Beast, &amp; by consequence to the Devill himselfe, that spake and wrought by the Beast: So I say God tooke away the impediments, and opened a way to their evill disposition: He used their evill disposition to this or that particular thing, even as a Worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:17825:16"/>
that finds an ill piece of timber, he makes not the timber ill, but when he finds it ill, hee useth it to his owne good purpose; and as a man (it is <hi>Luthers</hi> comparison) as a man that moves a Horse that is lame, hee doth not put lamenesse into the Horse, but useth him to his owne purpose being lame; so God finding these men evill in the generall, he directs this ill into particular courses, to worke it selfe this way, and not that, in this particular action, not in that: For God although he be not the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of evill, yet he is the Orderer of it, and he determines and directs it, both to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and also to that end which he pleaseth.</p>
                  <p>In a word, consider sinne in three distinct times, before the commission, in it, and upon the performance: Before, God doth not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it, nor infuse it, but disallow and forbid it: In the sinne, he permits it to be done; how? by substracting of his grace, in not working, then by offering occasions that are good in themselves: And thirdly by tradition, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving men up to Sathan; as here the Beast is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up to Sathan, and the Kings were given up to the Beast: So that God gives men up by substraction of his grace, and by tradition, and then he doth uphold them in the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of sinne, upholds the powers: And when it is done, applies them to this particular, and not to that particular: In the doing of it, hee limits it, he sets the bounds of it, both for the time of it, as also for the measure of it, as here
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:17825:17"/>
in the Text: <hi>Thus long shall the ten Kings give up their Crownes to the Beast; and thus farre shall they goe, untill the time come, that the Word of God shal be fulfilled:</hi> so hee limits sinne in the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of it, both for the measure, and also for the time: <hi>The Rod of the wicked shall not rest up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the backe of the righteous.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus you see the meaning of the words, <hi>God will put into their hearts;</hi> that is, by with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing of his grace, which they deserved by their sinfull courses; and offering to them this Man of sinne, this Beast, which shall come with such efficacies of errour, so that his grace being with-drawne, and they given up to the Devill, to Sathan, and the Beast, they shall without doubt be deluded, and seduced, but with this limitation, untill the time come, that the Word of God shall be fulfilled,</p>
                  <p>I might be large in this point, but it is not so sutable to the occasion, onely somewhat must be said for the unfolding of the Text: So much therefore for that.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>God put into their hearts to fullfill his will, and to agree to give up their Kingdomes to the Beast.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>They agree all unto it, and therefore it was not a thing done by force: Rome, and the heathen Emperours did compell men, did overcome men by force of Armes; these agree, it was a voluntary, and a free act in them; necessary it was in regard of Gods judgement, but it was free and voluntary in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:17825:17"/>
of themselves, for with one consent they gave up their Kingdomes to the Beast.</p>
                  <p>Thus having unfolded the meaning, wee come to observe some truths and conclusions that doe arise out of the words. I will not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion all, or the most that might bee observed, but only some speciall.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>God put into their hearts to give up their Kingdomes to the Beast.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here first of all from this ariseth, Gods spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall providence in Ill, in the greatest evill that can be there is his speciall providence appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; <hi>God put into their hearts to give up their Kingdomes to the Beast:</hi> Observe here many acts of his Providence, the with-drawing of his grace, the giving them up to Sathan, and to ill occasions, the presenting them with good occasions, which meeting with an ill disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion makes them worse; for good occasions meeting with an ill disposition makes it worse, makes it rage the more; as the stopping of a torrent makes it rage and swell the more; as also the limitation of all this, untill his Word shall be fulfilled; thus in this worke, Heaven and Earth and Hel meet in one action: Thus it was in that great action of the crucifying of our blessed Saviour, there is the action of God, in giving his Sonne to be a sweet Sacrifice, and the action of <hi>Iudas,</hi> and the Devill in him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying of Christ, and the action of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:17825:18"/>
in crucifying him. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> in the unfolding of this point, of the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God in Evill, observes how many may concur in one action, God without blame, man without excuse: God without blame, he finds men ill, and leaves men (deserving to bee left) hee takes away his grace, and as a Iudge gives men up to Sathan: Man without excuse, because man workes willingly, <hi>They with one consent gave up their Kingdomes to the Beast.</hi> That is the first.</p>
                  <p>The second is this, that the will of man may be swayed by divine governance, and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding work most willingly, and freely.</p>
                  <p>Here, God puts into their hearts to do this, and yet they willingly, and with one consent gave their Crownes to the Beast.</p>
                  <p>God first hath his Providence in ill, and then that provide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is such, that it doth not rob man of his liberty, because God finding man in an ill course, he forceth him not to this or that particular ill, but directs him only: <hi>The hearts of Kings are in the hand of the Lord, as the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of waters.</hi> A Man when hee findeth a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of water, hee doth not make the streame, but only makes way, that it may runne this or that way, as it pleaseth him; so God, finding the hearts of Kings, or the hearts of any, as the Rivers of water, Hee opens vent, that they should run this, and not that way; that they should be given to this, and not to that, here is the action of God, and yet the free li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:17825:18"/>
But how could this bee free, when they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ould not avoid it?</p>
                  <p>I answer, they were not privie to Gods di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting, they worked not in conscience of Gods moving, but they followed their owne <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>usts and will: Betweene Gods worke and Mans will, there is alwayes sinne: God never workes immediatly in Mans will; for Mans will is free, but Mans sinfull Free-will is the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ext cause in sinne: Although God put it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>o their hearts, yet hee found them sinfully disposed.</p>
                  <p>And then, the judgement is not bound or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>yed. The hearts of these Kings told them, that they might give their Crownes, or not give them to the Beast, their judgement saw they had reason to doe it, though their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were corrupt; so, a sinner sees reason to doe this or that, and although it bee corrupt reason, yet it moves him at that time, his judgement is not bound up, but God lets his judgement be free, though hee take away his heavenly light, and so hee judges perversely That's the second.</p>
                  <p>The third is, <hi>That it is a terrible judgement of God to be given up to a mans owne will, to leave a man to his owne consents.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is here spoken by way of judgement, <hi>That God put it into their hearts to give up their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes to the Beast.</hi> And indeed so it is a terrible judgement.</p>
                  <p>There are some objections to be taken
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:17825:19"/>
away, for the clearing of this weighty point.</p>
                  <p>How is it a judgement, or a punishment, when it is voluntary? <hi>They willingly gave up their Kingdomes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I answer, the more voluntary, and free a man is in sinne, the more and greater the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is; and as when sinne is more restrained, either inwardly by the Spirit, and by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, or outwardly by the Lawes and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, the more mercifully God deales with men, so the more free the current of the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition runs in ill wayes, the more wretched a man is.</p>
                  <p>Yea, but will the heart of some Atheisticall person presently say, what punishment is it, as long as I have liberty in evill, and meet with no hinderance in my courses, and feele no harme, but rather the contrary, as many that get their riches by ill meanes, and those great Papists, those great Vsurpers, wee see what estates they get to themselves.</p>
                  <p>I answer, Spiritual Iudgements are so much the greater, by how much they are lesse sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, because if they bee not sensible to us here, they will bee the more sensible to us hereafter: And those that have their will most here, shall suffer most against their will hereafter: It is the greatest judgement in this world, for a man to have his wil in sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full courses: Hee that shall make an Idoll of his will (especially a man that is in great place of Honour) that shall make all wayes serve for
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:17825:19"/>
the accomplishment of his will, when he hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>t, he is the most miserablest man in the world; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>or hee that hath his will most in courses un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justifiable, shall suffer most against his will, when he commeth to a reckoning: such men therefore are the more miserable, because such taking themselves to be absolute persons, and their waies the best wais, though they have many determents from their base courses, yet they will heare no counsell; and therefore the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>rder to be reclaimed; It doth not therefore take away from their punishment, but rather aggravate it.</p>
                  <p>I beseech you let me presse this a little, that these Iudgements are great Iudgements (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though wee doe not feele them) when with a free consent we give our selves unto ill: It is a heavie Iudgement when God leaves us to our owne lusts, and takes away the guidance of his Spirit, we had better that God should give us up to the Devill for a while to bee tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, we had better be in Hell (if a man might come out at a certaine time) then to bee given up all our life time, to doe with our owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and will, that which is liking to our owne will and lust; because by yeelding to our own will, wee yield to the Devill that rules in a Mans affections and will: For a Mans affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, when they are carried to evill, they are the Chariots of Sathan; when the Devil sees excessive sinfull affections; as excessive sinfull joy, and delight in sinfull pleasures; he being
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:17825:20"/>
about us, is alwayes carried in these affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and carries us also strongly in the wayes that lead unto eternall perdition.</p>
                  <p>Wee judge, when a man suffers some out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward punishment, as casting into prison, or the losse of his sight, oh hee is infearfull case; but what is the case of a man blinded by Sathan, and his owne lus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>s? A man that is a slave to his owne base affections, and by consequent to the Devill, which rules in his affections, and so consequently to damnation; A man that lies under the wrath of God, that hath no heart to repent; If a man had spirituall eyes, to consider the case of that man, he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver pitty so much the case of those men that suffer outward losses, as hee would pitty those which he sees to live, and oftentimes to die in evill courses of life.</p>
                  <p>This should therefore be an use of direction to us, that seeing we heare, that God rules the hearts of men, that hee takes away his Spirit, and leaves men to occasions, wee should pray to God to rule our hearts himselfe; <hi>Lord take thou the rule of our hearts to governe them thy selfe:</hi> It was a good prayer of the Ancient Church, <hi>Oh God from whom all holy desires, and all good counsels doe proceed, &amp;c.</hi> Indeed it is hee from whom all good counsels doe proceed. These ten Hornes, they were ten Kings, no doubt but as they were men of great place, so of great parts, but without Gods Spirit, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his light, the greatest and the wisest man is
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:17825:20"/>
but mad, he is as a man out of his wits, puzzeled in darknesse, and knowes not which way to goe. When God gives men over to their own lusts to their blind affections, they lead men to judgement, &amp; they must needs fall into the pit.</p>
                  <p>Let us desire God to put into our hearts ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly desires, holy purposes; for from him all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly desires come; let us desire him not only to governe our estate, and to preserve our bodies from danger; but Lord keepe thou our hearts, we cannot keepe our hearts of our selves, doe thou bend our understandings, bow our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and our wils, that they may run in the right way.</p>
                  <p>And (to stirre us up to this the more) wee must know, that that Evill which wee do not, we are beholding to God for, as much as for the good wee doe. Why doe not men, having an ill disposition, and corruptature, doe ill? Because God offers not occasions of ill; if God should offer occasions, they would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Evill as well as others; It is God that puts into mens hearts to hate that Evill: If God should take away his Spirit, men would not hate evill, when occasions are offered, as these men did not, when the occasion was offered, <hi>They gave up their kingdomes and thrones to the Beast.</hi> So that we are beholding to God, for all the ill that we do not, either it is his not offring occasions, or else his giving us strength in the occasions. This we forget. Wee are apt to say, this wicked man hath done this,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:17825:21"/>
this good man is fallen into this, this man hath done that: but where is our devotion at this time? we should rather say, Lord it was thee for causes thou best knowest, for if thou hadst left me (especially when occasions were presented and offered, and there was a correspondent corruption in my heart) to close with the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, <hi>I had fallen into the like sinne, it was thy keeping, and not my goodnesse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>One thing more, the Beast is exprest before in Chapter 13. to bee lead by the Devill. So that howsoever the Devill, who by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> is called the God of this world, and the Pope the subordinate Vicar to the Devill (and so by consequence he is the Devill, for the Devill, the Dragon rules him:) Howsoever I say there be the Devill, the God of this world, and the Pope in this world, the Vicar of that Dragon, yet there is but one Monarch, one that rules all, both Devill and Pope, and all the wicked limbs of both to his owne ends. It was God that put it into the hearts of these Kings to give up their Kingdomes to the Beast: It is he alone that is absolute, that gives the liberty of the Chaine, both to men and devils: <hi>Thus farre they shall goe, and no further.</hi> It is a good saying of the Schooles, <hi>There is no Ill so ill, as there is good that is good,</hi> there is not any ill so strong, as God is good: but every ill must come under the government of God: The Devill himselfe, nor the vile heart of man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not goe out of his rule, yet may runne out of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:17825:21"/>
his Commandements, but then it runs into his Iustice, hee may goe against the revealed will of God, but then hee runs into his secret will: there is no Ill, Ill in that degree, that God is good, but every Ill is in somewhat, and from somewhat, and for somewhat that is good, as it is over-ruled by God. The cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of Christ, which was the worst action that ever was, yet it tended to the greatest good, <hi>viz.</hi> the salvation of mankind. So this giving to the Beast, of these ten Thrones, by these ten Kings, it was a sinne, and a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their sinne, but it was for a good end, as wee shall see afterward, if the time will give leave.</p>
                  <p>This should teachus absolute dependance, and subjection to this great God; they need feare no creatures, that feare God, they need feare no Devill, nor Turke, nor Pope, nor all the lims of them, for God is the absolute Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch of the world, he can doe what hee will, and if God be on our side, who can be against us? It is said, that hee is a wise Politician, that can make his owne ends out of his enemies designes: The great Governour of heaven and earth can doe so; He can put a hooke into the nostrils of the Leviathans of this world, and can draw them, and rule them as hee plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth; they may doe many things, but it shal be all to accomplish his ends and purposes, they shall doe his will: God put it into the hearts of these Kings to fulfill his will; (Hee) put it
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:17825:22"/>
into their hearts, to agree to give up their king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes to the Beast; and so they did submit themselves to Antichrist, for a great while.</p>
                  <p>In the next place it is expressed how this came, <hi>They (Gave) their Kingdomes to the Beast.</hi> Wee are to see how farre faulty these Kings were, and how farre faulty the Pope, the Beast, was to whom they gave their Kingdomes. For it may be objected, that these men they did but obey God, for hee put it into their hearts, and for the Pope, they offered their Kingdomes to him, and who would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive offered Gold? But here is a deale of devillish deceit; for first, God gave them over to themselves, and they gave themselves, and their Kingdomes to the Beast; what then was sinfull in them? This, to give their Kingdomes to the Beast?</p>
                  <p>This, they betrayed their Kingdomes; Here is a wrong to God, a wrong to themselvs, and a wrong to their Subjects. A wrong to God, whose Vice-gerents they were; did he give them their Kingdomes, to give them to his Enemy, to give them to the Beast, and by consequence to the Devill? Doth God raise up men to rule, that they should enthral them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and their Kingdomes to the Beast, to give them to Gods Enemies? No, Kings raigne by Him; The Pope saith, by mee: Is their constitution of men? No, Kings raigne by God, they derive their authority from him: <hi>It is he that hath power over Kings, Dan.</hi> 2.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:17825:22"/>
They raigne not if he will, and they may rule <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>f he will, by his will permitting, else no man can raigne, <hi>By mee Kings raigne:</hi> If then they reigne by him, it is a treason against God to betray the Kingdomes, that hee hath given them, into the hands of his Enemies: It is a wrong to Christ, whereas they should kisse the Sonne, by kisses of subjection, as Princes use to doe in the Eastern Countries, to fall downe and kisse their Soveraignes toes, they doe (in this) the cleane contrary.</p>
                  <p>Here is a wrong to themselves, they betray their owne authority, that when God hath made them Kings to rule, they will bee slaves, and it is a great sinne for a man not to maintain his standing, as it is well observed by his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, who (if ever Prince did) doth vindicate himselfe, and challenge his regall authority, and it shall continue, and make him live even to the worlds end. It is the greatest sinne for a man to betray himselfe; Every man is to maintaine that place and standing, that God hath set him in. These ten Hornes they wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themselves, and their place, God made them Kings over their people, and they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come slaves to an Antichristian Priest.</p>
                  <p>It was a great wrong to their Subjects, king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes we know follow their Kings, and if <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam</hi> make Israel to sinne, all Israel will quickly sinne: diseases come from the head, if the head be naught, there will bee a disease in the body ere long; A greater stone being tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:17825:23"/>
downe from a Hill, it carries lesser stones along with it; so, great Kings when they fall themselves, they draw their Kingdomes after them: therefore the phrase of the Scripture is, <hi>God put into their hearts to give,</hi> not onely themselves, but their Kingdomes to the Beast: for commonly the Idoll of the people is their King, and being led by sense, and not by faith, they feare him more then they feare God, and their owne restraint, more then they feare Hell, and so they come to this damned Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion by depending upon him: therefore it is a wrong to the people, knowing they are so sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish by nature, and wanting faith, are fearing terrour led by the present command of their King. Thus it was a wrong in these Kings eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way.</p>
                  <p>But the Pope, the Beast, what was too blame in him? He did but take that which was offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him, <hi>They gave their Kingdomes to the Beast.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I answer, Indeed hee tooke that which was offered him, but he did abuse these Kings, hee abused the Christian world, Hee had no title to these Kingdomes, but was a fraudulent Possessor of them, because hee came to them by a slight; Hee raised himselfe to the Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome by the ruines of the Empire; for upon the divisions of the Empire, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour having enemies in the East, hee was faine to rest in Constantinople, and thereupon Rome being much neglected, at last was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run by the Gothes and Vandals, and the Pope

And then againe, hee gave dispensations to sell soules, and so men might doe what they would, they should have Pardon, otherwise they should have Excommunication.</p>
                  <p>And then againe, hee had preferments for the Sonnes of the Hornes, Cardinals places for their second Sons, that they should be great Princes, he had high places for them.</p>
                  <p>Then againe, hee layed his foundation on false grounds; He would be universall Bishop, and the Church could not erre, and al of them must fetch, and determine of their matters from him, and appeale must be made to none, but to him, and in certaine cases none could satisfie the Conscience but him. So that hee greatly raised his authority by these false and cousening meanes, and all that yielded to him, were a deluded company of people, that were deluded by the false and subtill courses that he tooke. And therefore, although they gave their Kingdomes to him, yet he possessed them by a fraudulent ritle, the meanes he used were diabolicall.
<q>They gave their Kingdomes to the Beast, till the word of God should be fulfilled.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Well, wee see here the Iudgement of God upon the Christian world; It was not onely a Iudgement upon these Kings, as they were Kings, but God punished the peoples sinne in
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:17825:26"/>
the slavery of these Kings to the Beast.</p>
                  <p>See here, the Iudgement of God upon Kings and Princes, for not esteeming as they should doe the glorious Gospel of Christ, for they both, Princes and people had it, but they esteemed it not, but delighted in untruths; therefore God gave them up to believe lies.</p>
                  <p>We are not therefore over-much to pitty our Ancestors, though they deserve pitty, yet wee excuse them over much this way; for certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God is just in his Iudgement, who seeing them delight in lies, more then in his truth, tooke away his grace, and gave them up to this Beast, that they should give up their authority, both Prince and people to him; And because they would not be ruled by Gods will, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves wiser then he: He appointed them to be ruled by one that should bee ruled by the Devill: For the Devill was in the Pope, and who would serve the Devill, if hee knew it? But because they would not yield unto Christs sweet government; therefore he gave them over to a government fit for them, even to be governed by the Beast.</p>
                  <p>I beseech you take notice of this point, when we entertaine not the glorious Gospel of Christ, the good word of God, that word that declares salvation unto us, and which is an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument to worke grace in us, to fit us for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; that word that is the seed, and the food of our new Birth, the Evidence of our Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance; that good word, which is the greatest
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:17825:27"/>
Iewell under heaven, when we doe not value that, it is the greatest errour that can be, and it is just with God, to give us up to this, and to that errour, if not unto Popery, yet unto some one errour that the Devill is in, and contrary to the Spirit of God. Doe yee thinke, if a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster should see his servant take ill courses, and would not doe according to his appointment and admonition, that he would not leave him to take his owne course, and so let him do his owne will, that thereby he might see his folly, in not being ruled by him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So it is just with God, when hee sees that wee doe not make much of his Gospel, of his soule-saving Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, that we will not have that alone, but Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions with it, and that besides Christ, wee must have other Mediators, as if Christ were not rich enough: It is just with God to give both Prince and people up to the Beast. Let us therefore make much of the Gospel: what moved God to give up the Easterne Empire, those glorious Churches in Saint Iohns time, unto the Turke? nothing but this, they did not value the Gospel: What moved God to give up those Western Kings to Romish An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist (for those two, the Turke and Pope are twins, they had their beginning at once, about 700. yeares after Christ) what moved this? But only when God had dealt graciously with them at the first, and gave them his truth to save their soules, (which is the most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortablest thing in the world, to have God dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:17825:27"/>
what he meanes to do with us, and what he would have us to doe) when he discovered his will to them, and saw them leave his will, saw them leave Gold, and take Drosse, prefer the traditions and wisedome of men before the wisedome of God, it was just with him to give them up to beleeve lies.
<q>They gave their Kingdomes to the Beast (marke the limitation here, untill) until the word of God should be fulfilled.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I see I cannot make an end of the Text; a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle further, and so I will conclude.</p>
                  <p>Here is an Vntill, here is a stop, the Devill and the Beast had their time to seduce the Kings, and the Kings had their time to bee se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, and to give up their Kingdomes, but God hath his time, Christ hath his time: Christ gives his enemies time, and then takes time himselfe: <hi>Vntill the time that the Word of God shall be fulfilled.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We see here then a mixture of mercy with justice, that after God had given them up just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not only the Easterne Empire, but also the Western Kings to the Pope, yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding here is an Vntill. God limits Ill, not only for the measure of it, but also for the time of it; God at length turnes the streame of things, so that these Kings that were thus abused, and baffeled by this Man of sinne, this Beast, at last they grow wise, by the in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>nct of God,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:17825:28"/>
and hate the Beast, as much as ever they loved her.</p>
                  <p>So then this is the point. That the same God, that by divine Providence gave way to these Kings, to abuse the doctrine of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell, and that gave way to these people, that were unthankefull, to yield themselves in such slavery to the Pope, yet notwithstanding in mercy God at the last put into the hearts of these Kings to with-draw their necks from this yoke, and to put their necks under Christs yoke.</p>
                  <p>This Vntill, hath had a beginning many yeare agoe; for wee know, (to omit other Kings of other Countries) King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight of <hi>famous memory,</hi> (take him without those things we cannot upbraid; now he was a man of great, and excellent parts, as hee was of great vices:) Hee was an excellent instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Christ, to unhorse the Pope, to shake off his government, to hate the Whore, and to eat her flesh; that is, to overthrow the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries, those Cages of uncleane Birds, and those <hi>Peter-pence,</hi> those exactions; for indeed the Pope made England his Asse, to beare his burthens: It would move any mans patience, to see how pittifully the Popes of Rome have abused this Iland, so that we may now truly say as Christ saith: <hi>If the Son make you free, you are free indeed;</hi> Christ hath made us free, the Gospel hath made us free, and ever since the comming of the Gospel wee have
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:17825:28"/>
flourished. King <hi>Henry</hi> shooke off the yoke first, and after him King <hi>Edward,</hi> and after him <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of blessed memory, and now our gracious King. So that this Vntill, it begun long since to hate the Beast, and to eat her flesh; one thing ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> is yet undone, <hi>To burne her with fire,</hi> if they hate the Beast, and eat her flesh, this will c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>, to burne her with fire, even the ten Kings that were subject to her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore shall doe that.</p>
                  <p>Wee see wickednesse shall not thrive al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, it shall not alwayes bee night, but the Sunne shall arise at the last, Impostures shal not alwayes abuse the world, their madnesse shall be made manifest at length; as <hi>Paul</hi> saith, 2 <hi>Tim. This is our Comfort, that there is an Vntill,</hi> a time prefixed of God, to discover, and to lay open all Impostures: And now the time is come, that most of this should be fulfilled, some of these words of God are fulfilled, the Beast is hated, and now the Beast is known to bee the Beast, to bee cruell, witnesse the blood of Saints, the Murther of Kings, those horrible acts that are allowed from Rome. The Beast I say is now discovered, and hated.</p>
                  <p>The Affections that are due to the Beast is hatred. If ever we hatred any thing, we may hate the state of Rome: It is a Beast, and the object of hatred, and ever was; and if ever I say wee hated any thing that was deserveable of our hatred, it is that, why? do we not hate a Harlot? doe we not hate an old Strumpet, an
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:17825:29"/>
old painted Strumpet? doe wee not hate her that is a Bawd? there was never Bawd, there was never Whore that did the thousand part of that harme, that this Bawd, this Beast, this Whore of Rome hath done, drawing so many thousand soules to hell.</p>
                  <p>Of all the Iudgements that ever were since the beginning of the Christian world, that God hath visited the pride and wickednesse of men with, there was none so grievous, as to suffer this Man of sinne to rule in the Church: the spirituall judgement of the Papacie, it is the greatest judgement of God, that was ever inflicted upon any.</p>
                  <p>We hate them that misuse us under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of love, that cheat and cozen us, and we delight in their punishment; there was never Cheater, never Cozener like this: And surely so God hath fulfilled his word, that shee is ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted even in our Children, that know but the grounds of Religion, to whom Christ hath shined by the evidences of his thuth, that have the Spirit of God in them, they hate those Impostures, those abuses of Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, with which this Beast hath deluded the Christian world, which shewes that they have a contrary spirit to the Spirit of God; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed so they have, for besides their own base government, they maintaine the corruptions of men, feeding the pride and vanity of mens natures, with outward, formall, empty things; so that the very weake ones, even Children
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:17825:29"/>
now they hate the Whore, hate her Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures, hate her Cruelty, hate her Lying, and all.</p>
                  <p>I see the time is past, I can goe no further, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ut will draw to an end, only a little to still us up. Shall God then reveale, and discover this painted Strumpet, this Bawd, and shall wee la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to conceale her ill, shall we dawbe, shall we make her better then she is? shall we hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Gods purpose? Gods word is, that shee shall be revealed, the Princes shall hate her, and consume her with fire: Let every one of our purposes helpe Gods purpose and Providence, and decree in this point, that this shall be, it is Gods purpose; and whosoever stops it, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely they bring the judgement of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; those that would reare up <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ericho againe, wee know what befell them, and they that reare up Rome, that begins now to bee discovered, they bring the Iudgement of God upon them: God will performe this as well, as he performed the other, as he put it into the hearts of these Kings to betray their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes to the Beast, so hee will put into their hearts to hate the Whore.</p>
                  <p>Now that we may hate her, let every one la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in his place, Ministers in their place to lay open their Impostures, their cousenings, and all their filthinesse, whereby they deceive the people: Magistrates in their place to ocun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance the Ministers, to see the lawes execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as they may: These that through ignorance
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:17825:30"/>
are seduced, that are not Iesuited (for there is no hope of them) but others, their persons many times in the policie of state may have favour, but not their Religion.</p>
                  <p>Let us all take heed that wee grow in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: Let us labour to make more of the Gospel of Christ, the more Christ appears in glory, the more Antichrist will appeare in shame; Let us labour by prayer, and not give God over by prayer, to plant the love of the truth in our hearts, to entertaine the truth with love, to value it according to the respect it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves at our hands, and let us labour to be mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into that truth, to obey it, else though we have it; yet if wee doe not love it, if wee be not transformed into it, though our wits and parts be never so great, we may be seduced to errour: God gave over these Kings, men of great place, and of great parts, because they did not love the truth, to beleeve lies.</p>
                  <p>My purpose was to have shewed the danger, if we do not further Gods purpose in discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this wicked Antichrist: A state wherin the Devill, the Dragon, is effectuall, and this Book wondero<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

It is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner of danger now to relapse, and to apostatize, after the appearing of the glorious Gospel of Christ: then it was a hundred years agoe under darkenesse, and we know it to bee so: of all the judgements in this world it is the greatest for God to give up a man to decay in his love to the truth, to affect this cursed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,

that the sentence of God hath past upon, and it must be fulfilled, <hi>That they shall hate the Whore, and burne her with fire, that she shall be left desolate and naked.</hi>

                  <p>But you may object. Alas how is that like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be, when wee see now what strength the Beast hath gotten, and how he ru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Lord of all things; He hath said that Babylon is fallen, and therefore it must be so, he being Governour and Lord of all things, and of his word too, that can make all things prove ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to his purpose: Let us comfort our selves therefore, as if it were present, and not take offence at the state of the Beast, and the Whores flourishing, but present him to your selves as hee is set out in the Text, see him growing, see him rising, see him decaying, and at last see him cast into the bottomlesse pit, to burne in the Lake of fire for ever: It is you see the word of God from heaven, that he is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, and cast into the earth as a Mil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>And that that shall helpe this destruction forward, shall bee the course that themselves take; God as he hath decreed their destruction, so hee hath appointed that their owne plots, which they have devised for their owne main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, shall turne to their confusion: Doe you not thinke that the ruine of the Pope will be by the Iesuits, who are growen (by their pressing themselves, and by their pragmaticall

medling into Princes affaires, by their draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and assuming all busines to themselves, and by their striving, and bringing all to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession) to such hatred of the world, that even these meanes, which they themselves take, will be the meanes of the overthrow, and downefall of Popery: As the counsell of <hi>Achi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tophel</hi> was, the meanes to infatuate him, so their owne courses will cause their own overthrow.</p>
                  <p>In the Powder-treason, they thought they had been made for ever, but God turned their wickednesse upon their owne heads. And now in these later times, we may see that God takes his cause into his owne hands, and you know who spake it by observation, <hi>Hamans</hi> wife, <hi>If thou begin to fall, thou shalt not prevaile, but shalt surely fall before him;</hi> so if God take the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into his owne hands, as hee hath done al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, let them feare; <hi>For they shall surely fall and not prevaile, untill he hath wrought his worke in Sion, untill he hath thorowly purged his Church: they shall prevaile;</hi> there is a little time alotted them, but it is nothing, let us see by the eye of faith, what this Book saith of them, that they shall be destroyed, and let us looke on the courses they themselves take which wil cause their destruction; was there ever any thing that weakned Popery so much, as this despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate attempt that we now celebrate this day?

                  <p>Well, the time is past, I cannot finish the Text as I thought to have done: To speake to the particular occasion I need not, it is yet fresh: And what should we speake of the Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder-treason? the Iesuits and Priests ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Devill for their Mid-wife, they are big of such like plots, Hell, Rome, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, and the Iesuits, those Frogs of the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomlesse pit, they are full of devising such at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts.

                  <p>And next you see here, that God over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwes their wals, and by what meanes? by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>oore, and base means, by Trumpets of Rams<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>ornes; they had silver Trumpets, but they used not them, but meaner Instruments, Rams<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hornes, those were the meanes, and the time that they used them seven dayes together, and then that by faith, using these meanes, they overthrew the wals of <hi>Iericho,</hi> they fell down. From hence by Analogie, and proportion wee may see.</p>
                  <p>First of all, that carnall men they build up wals, and put their trust in them.</p>
                  <p>The secondis, that God confounds these courses.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:17825:38"/>
The third is, that God doth it by weak, and silly means beleeved by faith.</p>
                  <p>The last point is, that faith in the use of these meanes overcomes all. <hi>By faith the wals of Iericho fell downe after they had beene compassed about seven dayes.</hi> And then wee shall come to other things that concerne us, and apply it to the time. 
<q>Naturall men since the fall they must have somewhat to trust to.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Since man lost his first prop, and confidence, and communion with God, hee turnes to the <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Men natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally trust to somewhat.</note> creature, there is alway some confidence in some creature, and men leave God in what measure they trust that. When <hi>Cain</hi> was ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished his Fathers house, then hefals to build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Cities, he must have some contentment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and those that were escaped the flood, within a hundred yeares after the Flood they must build a Tower of Babell, that should reach to Heaven, to get themselves a name, wanting better courses. Every one will have some Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, and wall of <hi>Iericho</hi> to trust to; Riches are the Rich-mans strong hold, as <hi>Salomon</hi> saith. <hi>Achitophel</hi> trusted to a shrewd head and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, that proved his ruine afterwards. The Iewes had outward sanctitie to trust to, oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing it to the righteousnesse of Christ, the righteousnesse of faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. they would set a foot a dead Righteousnesse that could not <note place="margin">Rom. 10.</note>
                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:17825:38"/>
stand, and therefore they were shut from the Righteousnesse of God in Christ. Man will have a holinesse, a wisedome, a strength, and power of himselfe, in the things below here, as I might shew at large, both in examples, and otherwise: naturally we find it in our selves; if we be sicke, we trust to the Physician, and other meanes; if we be in danger, we flee to the arme of flesh, to some mighty man, wee trust in some great friend, if we have any; If we be in danger of invasion, or such like, wee trust our wals and defences, and till strong temptations come, we trust in our ownstrength till Sathan picke so many holes in it, that wee cannot stay there, and that conscience up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braids us: Alwayes a man hath somewhat to trust to, till he be brought to desperate condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and rather then he will have nothing to trust to, hee will trust to the broken Reed of Egypt, hee will trust to that that will deceive him, and hurt him, as the Reed of Egypt did the Iewes, rather then they would trust God, and the word brought by the Prophets, they would trust <hi>Ashur,</hi> and Egypt.</p>
                  <p>Now the Spirit of God in the Scriptures takes notice of this pronenesse to false confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: <note place="margin">Issue of false confidence dangerous.</note> 
                     <hi>Trust not in uncertaine Riches. If Riches increase, set not your hearts on them.</hi> And man when he sets his heart upon false confidence, the issues are more dangerous, hee will come against God; he doth not onely set up these holds, that hee hath in rebellion against God,

                  <p>In 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. there is a notable place to shew what holds there are in the heart of man, that <note place="margin">2 Cor. 10.</note> oppose against God, and his truth in his word, holds that Sathan keeps in man, and man joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Sathan the Enemy, holds against God and his truth. <hi>The weapons of our warfare</hi> (saith he) <hi>are not carnall, but mighty through God, to cast downe strong holds:</hi> The holds are within us, and wee are so farre from preparing our selves to Grace, and to entertaine Grace when it is offered, that naturally wee set up holds against God and Grace.

                  <p>This false reasoning, and Sophistrie; there is no man will goe to Hell without reason; take the debauchedst wretch that lives, he is <note place="margin">1 False reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings.</note> mad with some reason, and he will be damned with some reason; God is mercifull, Christ is come; and others are as bad as I, and I hope in time to repent; this vile reasoning must be turned out of a man before he can be saved. <note place="margin">2 Proud thoughts.</note>

                  <p>And then there be fore-casts; if I do thus, <note place="margin">3 Fore-casts of danger.</note> this danger will come of it, I sha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Thy wisedome hath caused thee to rebell, saith God to the King of <hi>Baby lon:</hi> Let not the wise man trust in his wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, insinuating that wise men are subject to trust in their wisedome, and the rich man in his riches, and the strong man in his strength; therefore God commands that they should not doe so. <hi>Thy wisedome hath made thee to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us take notice of this, and make this use <note place="margin">

above nature; for naturally every man before he be in communion and covenant with God, he hath some earthly false support or other to trust on, either within him; some policie, and wisedome; or without him some friends, or riches; some Bulwarke or other, and this sets him against God, and against the means of salvation, till God come in effectuall calling, and overturne all: but this doth but make way to other things, therefore I only touch it.</p>
                  <p>The second thing is this, that
<q>God first or last overturnes all vaine confidence in the creature, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Observ.</hi> 2. God over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes vaine confidence in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note>

                  <p>The wals of <hi>Iericho,</hi> downe they must; and whatsoever exalts it selfe against God, either it shall end in conversion, or confusion: because the time must come, that God must have all the glory: <hi>Was there ever any man sierce against God, and prospered? The rage of man turnes to the glory of God,</hi> saith the Psalmist. <hi>There is neither wisedome, nor policie, counsell nor strength, or any earthly thing against the Lord,</hi> as the Wise-man saith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. <hi>God will confound all, he scattered</hi>

                     <hi>the proud in the Imagination of their own hearts,</hi> as the blessed Virgin saith: And when they had built Babell, to get them a name, they found confusion. There is a notable place in <hi>Esay</hi> 50. <hi>Behold all you that kindle a fire, that compasse your selves about with sparks; Walke</hi>

                  <p>Therefore let us make that use that <hi>Ieremy</hi>

That for the second, briefly.</p>
                  <p>The third is this, that
<q>God doth this by base and weake meanes.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He confounds great, and mighty Enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Observ.</hi> 3. God dothit by weake meanes.</note> and mighty persons, and useth but base and despised meanes: As here the wals of <hi>Iericho</hi> fell downe with the noise of Rams-hornes. This I might carry along through all the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in the Scripture, from the creation to this present time, to shew how God doth great
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:17825:42"/>
things by despised meanes, sometimes by no meanes at all; sometimes cleane contrary to all meanes. When our Saviour Christ gave sight to the blind, hee put clay upon his eyes, that one would thinke were fitter to put them out. We see in the storie of the Israelites what an Oxe Goad did, and what <hi>Sampson</hi> did with the law bone of an Asse: Wee see by what a trick the Midiani es were put to flight by <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deon.</hi> In all the Stories wee see when God would doe great matters, hee doth it by base meanes: when hee would confound the pride of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> he will doe it by Frogs, and Lice, and such base creatures, that were fittest in Gods wisedome, to overthrow the pride of that wretched King: God, as he over-turnes the pride of men; so for the most part hee doth it by weake, and despised meanes.</p>
                  <p>And the Reason is cleare, that he may have all the glory; sometimes the meanes that hee <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reason.</hi> That God may have the glory.</note> useth have no influence at al to effect the thing: but are only joyned with the thing; as here, what influence could poor Trumpets of Rams<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hornes have to cast downe Wals? they could have none, but only it was a thing joyned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the wals fel down; they were things that must be used to try their obedience; and that they might know that it was not by chance that they fell downe, but by Gods power, and for other reasons. But if there bee any influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from the cause to the effect, it is supposed it cannot produce the effect of it selfe: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:17825:42"/>
I say God doth this, that he may have all the glory; for that is his end, and it ought to be our end: we see here though they had sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Trumpets, yet they must by Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment use these base meanes, Trumpets of Rams-hornes.</p>
                  <p>Now they were to use them seven dayes <note place="margin">Digression.</note> together, and therefore on a Sabbath day: but it was no breach of the day, because God can dispense with his own Law; In case of Charity good workes may be done on the Sabbath, and in case of duty likewise, as the Priests killed the sacrifice on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath: so here was sufficient warrant for them, God gave them a command, God that made the Law, can dispense with his owne Law in things that touch not upon his nature, as his truth, and purity, &amp;c. doth: In things that touch his nature, hee should deny himselfe, if hee should dispense: God cannot lie, because truth is naturall to him; God cannot doe any thing that is unfit for his nature: but for things that are out of him, he is Lord of dayes, hee is Lord of goods and life, hee hath a right to dispense here, as we see in the taking away the Egyptians Iewels, and the like; they were outward things: But for those things that are intrinsecall in God, hee cannot command that which is contrary to his truth, and nature, other things belong to his Soveraignty; but that by the way.</p>
                  <p>They were to compasse the wals seven
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:17825:43"/>
dayes: if they had made an end before the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day, the wals had never fallen down: howsoever there was no power in their going about to effect that, yet God would not worke the effect till hee was waited on in all the seven dayes. The meanes appointed by God must be used, and so long as God will have them used, there must be a depending and waiting upon God all the time.</p>
                  <p>To give a little further light, to that I touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before, you will aske, why God useth <note place="margin">Quest.</note> meanes, and doth not worke immediatly? why hee did not cast downe these wals by his owne will, and pleasure?</p>
                  <p>Besides, that I said before, God useth second <note place="margin">Answ.</note> causes, not for defect of power, but for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration of his goodnesse, and for the trial of our obedience, and the like: therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lord of Hosts hee hath multiplicity of rancks of creatures, which he useth to effect those things, that hee could doe himselfe, if it pleased him: therefore let such questions cease: it pleased God so to doe.</p>
                  <p>The last point is this:
<q>It was by Faith, in the use of meanes, that the <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Observ.</hi> 4. It is by faith in the use of means.</note> Wals of Iericho fell downe.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>If they had not depended upon God, in their going about seven dayes, the wals had stood still. It was by faith they did it, and it was a great faith, that using such a ridiculous stratagem as this, to goe about the wals with
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:17825:43"/>
Rams-hornes, they should thinke the walls would fall: It might shake their Faith, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise expose them to the scorne of those of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richo</hi> within: therefore it was a great faith in them: Not that all had faith; for certainely divers of them were unbeleeving persons: But <hi>Ioshua</hi> their Captaine, and some others of them had faith, and al of them had hope of the best. It was faith that believed this in this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likelihood of second causes; for there is the strength of faith, when second causes are weake, then faith is strong. <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith was the stronger, by reason there was more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposition in the second causes, in <hi>Sara's</hi> wombe to conceive a child; for her wombe was dead; in the course of nature shee could not conceive: therefore it is said by Saint <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 4. <hi>He being strong in faith, gave glory to God, strong faith gives glory to God.</hi> So here <note place="margin">Rom. 4.</note> was a strong faith, because the meanes were weake, or none at all; for these meanes had nothing in themselves to work such a glorious effect as this, that the falling of the wals should follow; it was but a meanes adjoyned; that it should be done by such a poore thing as this, it was the strength of faith. But was it the strength of faith in it selfe? could faith do this? <note place="margin">Quest.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Oh no; but that which that faith laies hold <note place="margin">Answ.</note> on doth, that faith is said to doe: God ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours the grace of faith, by terming that to be <note place="margin">Faith said to doe that which God doth.</note> done by it, that he doth himselfe; for it was the power of God, the goodnesse of God to
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:17825:44"/>
them, and the justice of God (against the sins of these people) that overturned the wals of <hi>Iericho,</hi> faith it was, but an empty hand to lay hold upon this power; it was the grace, whereby they went out of themselves, and denied themselves, and gave glory to God, in accomplishing the truth of his word, and his wisedome, and power, and justice. So God did it, but it is said to be done by faith; because as I said, God honours faith thus much. What strength God and Christ hath, when faith la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>es hold on them, faith hath that strength: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it builds upon them, faith sets a man up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God and Christ, and upon the truth of God: Hereupon it comes to be so victorious, &amp; conquering a grace as it is, because it caries us to that that doth all, by faith they did this.</p>
                  <p>But here were other graces likewise that <note place="margin">Why only faith is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</note> sprang from faith, that helped them also: There was a great deale of patience to goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout after that silly fashion, with Rams-hornes seven dayes together, here was patience, and perseverance, and hope: But as I said before, because faith doth enliven all other graces, it gives life to all, and stirs up all, therefore that is named. In the whole Chapter the exercise of other graces is attributed to faith, because they draw strength from that to quicken them all, and to stir them all to their several offices: strengthen faith, and strengthen all other gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces whatsoever. Thus you see we have briefly gone over these foure maine things.</p>
                  <p>

Now let us by way of proportion raise them <note place="margin">1 Kingdom of Sathan re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled by wals of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richo.</hi>
                     </note> higher, and make use of them to other things. To give a little touch. The wals of <hi>Iericho</hi> represent to us many things. The Kingdome of Sathan in generall, the power of the Devil in himselfe, and in his instruments, who hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders what he can, our comming out of Egypt to Canaan, he labours to come betweene us, and Heaven, to hinder us all he can by all means. He hath wals of many kinds, the strength of Tyrants, the subtiltie of Hereticks. What a world of adoe was there to bring Israel out of Egypt? God was put to it (as it were) to worke so many Miracles, to bring that poore despised people out of Egypt, to bring them through the Red Sea, when they were in the wildernesse: what ado was there to bring them thence? what opposition? and then when they came to Iordan, what Miracles were wrought? the division of the waters by the Arke comming through, and then the first, the frontier Towne, that was (as it were) the key to let in all, and to stop all: <hi>Iericho</hi> the first towne, for the entrance into <hi>Canaan,</hi> there was opposition made, when they would have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into <hi>Canaan.</hi> It is no easie thing to come out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and to enter into <hi>Canaan,</hi> it is a mighty worke to bring a poore Christian out of the Kingdome of Sathan, to bring him out of spirituall <hi>Egypt,</hi> through the Wildernesse of this life, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>But Christ came <hi>to destroy the workes of the Devill,</hi> as it is said 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 8. and he himselfe <note place="margin">1 Ioh. 3. 8.</note> overcame Sathan, and triumphed over him, as it is <hi>Colos.</hi> 2.

part of this Westerne part of the world, that they had in slavery before, and how by weak meanes (as you heard) by the preaching of the Gospel, by Learning, and Knowledge. It is no wonder that the Devill hates Knowledge and Learning, as <hi>Luther</hi> saith well, <hi>Hee hates the quils of Geese, because they are Instruments to write against them.</hi> Hee hath a Kingdome of darkenesse; and Hell, and the Pope is a King of darkenesse: Now when the light of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, the light of the Word of God, the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God, when preaching came; these poore Trumpets did shake the Church of Rome: As wee see in England, the wals of <hi>Iericho</hi> fell downe; by what m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>So wee see then, that as high as they built, and as much as they fortified, though they bee not wholly cast downe, yet they are shaken, and that by weake meanes.

Such a power there is in Gods Ordinance, the Spirit of God accompanying it, that it carries all before it, it layes all flat, it beats all strong holds downe before it.</p>

And take heed especially that we doe not build up the wals of <hi>Iericho</hi> againe, nor suffer them to build them: You know <hi>Ioshua</hi> pronounceth a curse upon al that should build the wals of <hi>Iericho,</hi> he should lay the first stone in the death of his eldest Sonne, and the last at the death of his youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; and so as wee have it in the storie of <hi>Hiel,</hi> it was made good. I beseech you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, let every one of us in our place, labour to ruinate these wals of <hi>Iericho,</hi> and take heed how wee build them againe, or suffer any to build them againe.</p>

to keepe life now; how shall we prevent this, that they build not up the wals of this spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all <hi>Iericho</hi> againe?</p>
                  <p>First of all, every one labour to doe what they can in their callings. Magistrates to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute <note place="margin">

                  <p>And so for Ministers; the spirituall means, <note place="margin">1</note> whereby such heresies must be confounded, it <note place="margin">2</note> is by the breath of the mouth of Christ, as it is 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. <hi>He shall consume him with the breath of his mouth:</hi> For things are dissolved contrary <note place="margin">2 Thess. 2.</note> to that way that they were raised at the first, and contrary to that way they were maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: Popery, as it was raised; so it is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by darkenesse, and blindnesse, and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the word of God, and of divine truth: the way to hinder it therefore from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing built againe, is to lay open divine truths, and to plant the ministerie: Every one must labour for this, to be faithfull in their place, and standing. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, 2 <hi>Tim. They shall prevaile no longer, because their madnesse shall be manifest.</hi> How doth that follow? The very manifestation of errour hinders the prevailing of it: That is the way to hinder Popery from prevailing, to manifest it by preaching, and writing, and such good meanes: For the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration of errours to be so, is a refuting of
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:17825:48"/>
them: For who would willingly be deceived? Therefore the laying open of the madnesse of Popery, and the folly of their devises, it hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders their prevailing; no man willingly would have his soule led into errour: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us lay their errours open in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie, and the grounds of them, the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Popery, how pernicious it is. When this is discovered in the Ministerie, men as they love their owne soules will take heed: That is the way therefore to keepe the wals of <hi>Iericho</hi> from being built, to set an able Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie every where, and to countenance them; and those that are Gods Captaines to fight his battels against them.</p>
                  <p>It is a world of hurt that comes to the Church by impropriations, especially in the North parts; as wee heare too much by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports: In great and mighty Parishes to set up poore, and weake men, and others wholly to receive the Revenues, and that is the reason of the swarm of dangerous Papists in those parts. Oh! that these things had beene looked to in time; The wals of <hi>Iericho</hi> had not beene built againe in those parts so much as they are. This is one maine way, the planting of an able mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery: for this painted Harlot, shee cannot endure the breath of the Ministerie, it disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers all her painting, it layes her naked and open, she knowes it well enough.</p>
                  <p>Then againe, take heed of the spreading of <note place="margin">3</note> infections: Men should bee carefull this way;
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:17825:49"/>
they build up their Religion thus, that else would fall downe more and more: Wee are so confident in our cause, that we suffer men to reade any Popish Treatises. They on the other side watch all things, so that there cannot a Sparke of our light breake into them, what by their Inquisition, and other cou ses that they take; Confidence in our cause hath made us carelesse, and secure in this kind; therefore care this way is one meanes to helpe it.</p>
                  <p>And then incouragement of good learning: Popery fell with the beginning of good lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; <note place="margin">4</note> Religion, and good learning came in together; If I were in some place, I should speake more of this; for as I said before, it is a darke Religion, not onely in regard of the Religion it selfe; but it growes, and thrives with Ignorance, and Barbarisme, and not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of Arts, and tongues, they have helped very much towards the overthrow of these wals of <hi>Iericho.

Prayer gets blessings, but thankefulnesse keeps them: so thankefulnesse to God for that which is past, for so many De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances, is a means to preserve Gods love, and care of us still; that he wil be our Buckler and castle, &amp; hold, and al defence, thankfulness will do this.

We are over prone to looke upon civill grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances (which are to be regarded, and helped in season) but naturally our nature is subject to complaine more then to be thankefull; we are so sensible of ill, as to pray for remedy: but then let us alway be thankfull to God for the good we have had these many years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the good that still (blessed be God) wee enjoy.

                  <p>And to helpe us, doe but consider, what if wee waite a few yeares, what is that to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie? I might inlarge the point: what great matters faith will doe, both in heaven, and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:17825:62"/>
earth, every way. Wee see here, faith shakes the very earth: God he is the Lord of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and earth. The earth is the Lords, because these wals were built upon Gods earth, we see here one puffe of God blowes them all down; and faith laying hold upon this casts them downe; though faith doth it not immediatly, yet God doth it, because he is laid hold on by faith.</p>
                  <p>Let us labour therefore to have faith above all other graces: It is the Mother Grace, it is <note place="margin">To labour for faith.</note> the Grace that is the spring of all Graces, if we wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ld have patience, and hope, and love, and perseverance, and constancie together; let us labour to have faith strengthened, and to feed our faith the more, let us looke to the word of God, make it familiar to us: the Spirit goes together with the word, to strengthen and increase our faith, and that being strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, all is strengthned whatsoever.</p>
                  <p>Now the way to try, whether we have this <note place="margin">To try if vve have faith.</note> faith or no (not to speake largely of the point, but as the Text leads me) is, if we humbly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon the meanes that God hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, though they seeme base to carnall reason: As how doe we know that these Israelites had faith, when they went about the wals of <hi>Ieri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho?</hi> because they have humbled themselves to use the base means, that God had appointed, though they were very unlikely. <hi>Naaman,</hi> out of the pride of his heart, saith he, what are the waters of Iordan? have not wee waters that
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:17825:62"/>
can doe as much? but if the servants had not beene wiser then the Master, hee had gone home a Leaper as he came: so when men hear the word preached, they thinke, cannot wee reade good bookes at home? and for the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, it is a poore Ordinance; what is there, but wine and bread, and such like? Take heed of a proud heart: God will have weaker meanes to try us, whether we will humble our selves to his vvisedome, or no: vvhere there is true faith, it will be carefull to use all good meanes, or else it is a tempting of God, and not a trusting of him, when wee doe not use the meanes that he hath sanctified.</p>
                  <p>And where there is faith, as there will bee a carefull use of all meanes, so there wil be a care in the use of meanes, not to depend upon the meanes, but to trust in God. There will bee a joyning of both together; faith doth not take away the use of means; nay, he that is most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the end, should strive to be most care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of al means used to that end. There ought no man to be more diligent in using the means, then he that is most certaine of the end; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hee is incouraged to use the meanes, knowing that he shall not beat the aire, that he shall not loose his labour, so if we by faith lay hold upon God for the destruction of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, and that God would subdue our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and that they shall fall before the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit by little, and little; if by faith we lay hold upon this that God will perfect the good
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:17825:63"/>
worke hee hath begun in the use of good meanes; this will stirre us up to use all means with chearfulnesse, and constancie. There are none that are more carefull of the means, then those that are most sure of the issue. Those that are carelesse of the meanes, let them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend what they will, they are presumptuous persons, they have no faith: for that will stirre us up to use the meanes, and in the use of meanes to depend upon God: so carefull is faith to use the meanes, as if without them God would doe nothing; and yet in the meanes it is so carefull to depend upon God; as if the means could not doe any thing without God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thus, faith walkes betweene the means, and the great God.</p>
                  <p>Let us goe on constantly in living the life of faith, and using all the blessed means that God hath sanctified: God ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>

In the meane time, let us exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise faith: and to quicken our faith the more, let us have those blessed times in the eye of our soule; let us see them as present: It is the nature of faith to apprehend things to come, as present: let us see heaven, and earth on fire:

his posterity. So that the Text is nothing else but a terrible denunciation under a curse of the destruction of the family of that person, that should labour to build up <hi>Iericho</hi> againe. I will not speake much of Cursing or Blessing, being not pertinent to my purpose; onely to give a touch of it. As in Blessing there are three things considerable, that come neer one another; there is a Blessing, a Prayer, and a Prophesie; the Prayer is for a blessing to come, the Prophesie, is of the certainty of it, that it shall bee, the Blessing is an efficacious application of the thing to the person. I mean those three, because the one gives light to the other. So it is likewise in Cursing, there is a Prayer, that God would poure forth his ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance upon the enemies of the Church, and a propheticall Prediction that God will doe it, and a Cursing, when it comes from a qualified person, that is lead by a better Spirit then his owne (for every one is not fit to cast these bolts;) Cursing is an efficacious application of the curse to the person. When a man is (as it were) the declarative instrument, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God workes, and brings the curse upon the person; so that we must account a curse to be a wondrous deepe thing. The persons quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for cursing or blessing, they are Parents, either politick, as Magistrates, or Parents na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, to curse or blesse their children, as we see in <hi>Noah, Cursed be Cham, &amp;c.</hi> Or else Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents spirituall, whose office it is indeed espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:17825:66"/>
to blesse, or curse. It is a greater mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the world takes it for, a blessing, or a curse, especially from a spirituall Father. The Apostles that were spirituall Fathers of the Church, they begun their Epistles with bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, and so the Prophets and Patriarkes.</p>
                  <p>Therefore wee should regard the blessing, <note place="margin">Blessing of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters to be regarded.</note> that God gives by his Ministers: Some are ready to runne out before the blessing, as not esteeming either blessing or curse. <hi>Luther</hi> a man of great parts, and grace, saith of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; <hi>That if a man of God should speake any thing terrible to him, and denounce any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, hee knew not how to beare it, it would be so terrible.</hi> The Iesuits themselves, amongst the rest one <hi>De Lapide,</hi> he saith, <hi>The Priest can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not sooner come into the Pulpit, but if there bee a Noble-man there, downe he fals, and all looke for the blessing of the Priest.</hi> The Devill is alwayes in extreames, either to drive people to super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition, or else to prophanenesse, and Atheisme, either to regard the blessing of those whom they should not regard, or not to regard any blessing at all; not to regard that good men should pray for them, or their Children; if the Devill can bring men to Hell, by either ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

with callings to pray, and to blesse, their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and blessings are highly to bee esteemed, and so likewise their curses. I would it were more esteemed, it would bee a meanes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey Gods blessing more then it is.
<q>Cursed be the Man before the Lord.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Take this Caution by the way; though <hi>Iosua</hi> were a man of God, hee was a mixt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; he was both a Magistrate, and in some sort a Minister: As we say of Kings, they are mixt persons, they are Keepers of both tables; <note place="margin">Custodes utrius<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que tabulae.</note> there is more in the supreme Magistrate, then is common. Every one must not take upon him to curse upon every motion of the flesh; for here it is not (as one of the Ancients saith well) <hi>The wrath of a man in commotion, and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; but the sentence of a man in a peaceable tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, who is the Conveyer of Gods curse;</hi> it is pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive here, as well as active.</p>
                  <p>In the New Testament we are commanded to blesse, and not to curse. It is a common fault, upon every distemper to fall a cursing, and oft times it lights as an Arrow shot up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards upon the head of the Curser: wee are people of Gods blessing, all true Believers, and wee should delight in blessing, having felt the blessing of God our selves upon our soules, we should be moved to blessing; both by way of gratitude to those that are our superiours, and have done us good, that God would blesse them: and by way of amity, and friend-ship
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:17825:68"/>
to those that are under us, or about us; and by way of mercy to our very enemies; we should pray for, and blesse our very enemies them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, as our Blessed Saviour praied for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>that cursed him. This should be our ordinary disposition, wee should be all for blessing. As for curses wee must take heed, that wee direct them not against any particular person, we have <note place="margin">Not to curse particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</note> no such warrant, though the Primitive Church pronounced a curse against <hi>Iulian,</hi> a notable Enemy: And Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> he cursed <hi>Alexander</hi> the Copper-smith; but for us this time, the safety way is to pronounce all those curses in the <hi>Psalmes,</hi> and else where in Scripture, upon the implacable, and incorrigible enemies of the Church, the whole body of the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Church, and so we should not erre. I will not dwell longer upon this Argument, only I thought good to remember you to regard the blessing, of those that have the Spirit of God to blesse, especially that have a calling to doe it, and to take heed of cursing. But to come to the particulars.
<q>Cursed be the Man before the Lord.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That is, let him be cursed indeed, that that is done before the Lord is truly, and solemnly done: this was a solemn Curse, a heavie Curse, &amp; it did truely light upon him. And let him be cursed before the Lord, however the world blesse him, as a man cannot doe such a thing,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:17825:69"/>
as to build a Citie, but the world will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend a man for doing such a thing, but it is no matter for the worlds commendation, if a man set upon a cursed cause, so much for the phrase, <hi>Cursed be the Man before the Lord;</hi> that is, hee is truely, and solemnly cursed and cursed before the Lord, though men blesse him.
<q>That riseth, and builds this Citie <hi>Iericho.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That is the cause why he should be cursed? because he would build that Citie, that God <note place="margin">Why God would not have <hi>Iericho</hi> built againe.</note> would have to bee a perpetuall monument of his Iustice. Why would not God have <hi>Iericho</hi> built againe?</p>
                  <p>God would not have it built up, partly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hee would have it a perpetuall remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his goodnesse, and mercifull deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">As a monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Gods mercy and justice.</note> with his people, passing over Iordan, and comming freshly into Canaan: for wee are all subject to forget; therefore it is good to have dayes set apart for remembrance, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to put us in mind, as they had many things in old time to helpe memory. If this Citie had beene built againe, the memory of it would have beene forgotten, but lying al waste and desolate, the Passengers by would askethe cause, as God speakes of his owne people: what is the reason that this Citie lies thus? and then it would give them occasion, of speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the mercy of God to his people. And likewise it would give occasion to speake of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:17825:69"/>
the justice of God against the idolatrous Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, whose sins were grown ripe: God fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told in <hi>Genesis,</hi> that the sins of the Amorites was not yet ripe: but now their sins were ripe, they were Idolaters.</p>
                  <p>And likewise it was dedicate to God, as the <note place="margin">2. It was dedicate to God.</note> first fruits, being one of the chiefe mother Cities of the land, it was dedicate, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated to God, as a thing severed, it was to bee for ever severed from common use. There are two wayes of severing things from common use, one by way of destruction, as here the Citie of <hi>Iericho:</hi> Another by way of dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the Gold of <hi>Iericho.</hi> God would have this Citie severed from common use, as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall Monument, and remembrance of his mercy, and justice.</p>
                  <p>And likewise hee would have it never built <note place="margin">3 For terrour to the rest of the people.</note> up againe, for terrour to the rest of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants: For usually great Conquerours set up some terrible example of justice to terrifie others: Now this being one of the first Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, after their passing over Iordan: God would have the destruction of it to strike ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, together with this sentence of a curse, upon all that should build it againe for ever.</p>
                  <p>And then that this terrible sentence might <note place="margin">4 To draw others to come in.</note> be a meanes to draw others, to come in to Gods people to joyne with them, and submit, and prevent their destruction, seeing how ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly God had dealt with <hi>Iericho.</hi> Many such reasons may bee probably alleaged: but the

                        </gap>,</hi> he was but Gods Trumpet, and Gods instrument to denounce this curse. <hi>Cursed be the man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, that shall build up this Citie</hi> Ieri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho, wee must rest in that. I will goe over the words, and then make application afterwards to the occasion.</p>
                  <p>I come to the specification of the Curse, wherein it stands. <hi>Hee shall lay the foundation thereof in his First-borne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If any man will bee so venturous to build it <note place="margin">The specifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the curse. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 16. 34.</note> up againe, as one <hi>Hiel</hi> did, in 1 <hi>King.</hi> 16. 34. If any man will be so audacious, he shall doe it with the perill of the life of his first begotten; and if he will not desist then, he shall finish the Gates of it, hee shall make an end of it with the death of his younger Sonne. It is Gods custome, to denounce a threatning of a curse <note place="margin">3 God threatneth before he strike.</note> before he execute it. It is a part of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and of his blessing, that he will curse one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the threatning: for therefore he curseth, that hee might not execute it: and therefore he threatneth, that hee might not smite, and when he smites, he smites that hee might not destroy, and when he kils the body, it is that hee might not destroy the soule, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 32. <hi>Therefore some of you are weak, and sick, and</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 32</note> 
                     <hi>some sleepe, that you might not bee condemned with the world.</hi> Thus God is mercifull, even till it comes to the last upshot, that men by their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions provoke him; Gods mercie strives
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:17825:70"/>
with the sins of men. Marke here the degrees of it, first God threatens the Curse, <hi>Cursed be the man.</hi> And then in the particulars, he begins with the eldest Sonne. First there is a threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and when the execution comes, he takes not all his Sons away at once, but begins with the Eldest; and if that will not doe, he goes to the youngest.</p>
                  <p>This carriage of God, even in his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, <note place="margin">To move us to turne to him.</note> it should put us in mind of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; and likewise it should move us to meet God presently, before any peremptory decree be come forth (as wee shall see afterward:) for if wee leave not sinning, God will never leave punishing: Hee might have desisted in the death of his first Son: but if that will not be, God will strike him in his youngest Son, and sweepe away all betweene: for so wee must understand it, that both elder, and younger, and all should die.</p>
                  <p>Now for the judgement it selfe.
<q>He shall lay the foundation thereof, in his First-borne.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is some proportion between the <note place="margin">Punishment proportionable to the sin.</note> judgement, and the sin. The sin was to raise up a building, a cursed Citie contrary to Gods will: The punishment is in pulling dow ea mans owne building: for Children (according to the Hebrew word) are the building, the Pillars of the house; and since he would rais<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <pb n="110" facs="tcp:17825:71"/>
up a foundation, and building contrary to Gods mind, God would pull up his founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Cities are said to have life, and to grow, and to have their pitch, and then to die like men: And indeed they doe, observing onely a proportion of time, they are of longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance: but otherwise Cities live and grow, and die, and have their period as men have. Now he that would give life to a Citie, that God would have buried in its owne ruines, God would have his sonnes die, hee would have his sons (as it were) buried under the ruins of that Citie, that he would build in spight of God, that would give life to that Citie that was cursed. Oft times we may reade our very sins in our punishments, there is some propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But to goe on to the particulars.
<q>He shall lay the foundation in his First-born.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>A heavie judgement; because the First-borne, <note place="margin">Death of the First-borne a great judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> as you know he saith of <hi>Reuben,</hi> he was his strength, and he was King, and Priest in the Family: the First-borne had a double por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; hee was redeemed with a greater price (as wee see in <hi>Moses</hi> Law) then other sonnes. It was a heavie judgement to have his First-borne smitten in this fashion, to be taken away.</p>
                  <p>If any aske why God was so severe, that hee <note place="margin">Why God sometimes pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth parents in their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note> did not punish <hi>Hiel</hi> in himselfe, but take away his children, it may seeme against reason.</p>
                  <p>But we must not dispute with God: for wee
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:17825:71"/>
must know that God hath the supream power, of life and death.</p>
                  <p>Then we must know againe, that children <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>re part of their Parents, God punisheth the parents in their children: and it is a heavier punishment oft times in their esteeme, then in themselves: for they thinke to live, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in their children; now when they see their children tooke away, it is worse then death; men oft times live, to see things worse <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>hen death, as those that see their children kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led before them, as <hi>Zedechias,</hi> and <hi>Mauritius</hi> the Emperour: for indeed it is a death oft. A man dies in every child, this man hee died in his eldest son, and he died in his youngest son; he died in regard of the apprehension of death, it was more sharpe in apprehension, then when he died himselfe. So it is a heavie judgement to be stricken in our children: God when hee wil punish, he punisheth oft times in posterity; As we see it was the most terrible judgement of all upon <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> that in his First-borne, God drew them all to let Israel goe out, when <hi>He smote their First-borne:</hi> It is a heavie judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for a man to be stricken in his First-born, either when they are dissolute, and debauch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and lawlesse, (for God hath judgements for the soule, as well as for the body) or else when they are taken out of the world.</p>
                  <p>But thirdly, which is very likely another reason that moved God (that we may justifie God, in all our sentence, that we give of him)

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:17825:81"/>
looke that it will drive thee to despaire. For conscience will tell thee, that thy life hath bin a strengthning of pride, of vanity, of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse, and of other sins, thy whole life hath beene such; and now when thou shouldst looke for comfort, then thy corruptions, which thou shouldest have subdued, they are growne to that pitch, that they will bring thee to despaire, without the extraordinary mercy of God to awaken thy heart by repentance. Why therefore should we strengthen that that is a curse, and will make us cursed too? and will make the time to come terrible to us, the houre of death, and the day of judgement? How shall men thinke to hold up their faces, and heads at the day of judgement, whose lives have beene nothing else, but a yielding to their owne corruption of nature, and the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and vanities of the times, and places they have lived in? that have never had the courage to plead for God, that have beene fierce against God, <hi>Who ever was fierce against God, and prospered?</hi> When men make their whole life fierce against God, against the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions of his word, and Spirit, and their whole life is nothing but a practise of sinne; how can they thinke of death, and judgement without terrour?</p>
                  <p>Now it were wisedome for us, to carry our selves so in our lives, and conversations, that the time to come may not bee terrible, but comfortable to thinke of; that wee may lift
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:17825:82"/>
up our heads with joy, when wee thinke of death, and judgement: but when we doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but build <hi>Iericho;</hi> when we raise up sin, that wee should ruine more, and more, what will the end of this be, but despaire here, and destruction in the world to come?</p>
                  <p>You may shake off the menaces, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings <note place="margin">Christs sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</note> of the Ministers, as <hi>Hiel</hi> shooke off <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

So there are many that thinke, that words are but wind of men, opposite to such, and such things: but though our words may bee shooken off now, and the word of God now in the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, may be shooke off; yet it will not when it comes to execution. When wee propound the curse of God against sinfull courses, you may shake off that curse: but when Christ from Heaven shall come to judge the quick, and the dead, and say, <hi>Goe yee cursed,</hi> that were borne cursed, that have lived cursed, that have main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a cursed opposition to blessed courses; that have not built up your owne salvation, but your corruptions, you that loved cursing, <hi>Goe yee cursed to Hell fire, with the Devill and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels for ever:</hi> will you shake off that? No, no, howsoever our ministeriall in r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>aties, may be shaken off: yet when God shall come to judge the quicke, and the dead, that eternall threatning shall not be shaken off. Therefore I
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:17825:82"/>
beseech you, consider not so much what wee say now, but what God will make good then, <hi>What wee bind on earth,</hi> cut of the warrant of Gods booke, <hi>Shall be bound in Heaven,</hi> and God will say Amen, to that wee say agreeable to his word.</p>
                  <p>Thinke not light of that wee speake: for <note place="margin">To tremble at Gods word.</note> God will make good every word, hee is <hi>Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah,</hi> he will give being to every word. Hee is not only mercie, but justice (we make an Idol of him else) and wee must fea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>e him in his justice. He loves to dwell with such as are of a contrite Spirit, that tremble at his word.</p>
                  <p>It is said of <hi>David,</hi> that when <hi>Vzzah</hi> was stricken, he trembled. <hi>Hiel,</hi> and such kind of persons regard not the threatnings of God, but goe on, and treasure up wrath. It is a signe of a wicked man to heare the menaces, and threatnings, and not to tremble. To end all with two places of Scripture; saith <hi>Moses, He that heares these things, and blesseth himselfe, my wrath shall smoke against him.</hi> Gods wrath shall smoake, and burne to hell against such a one as blesseth himselfe, that knowes he is cursed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the seale of God, that doth ill, and yet hee blesseth himselfe in doing ill: therefore take heed of that, adde not that to the rest, Gods wrath will smoake against such a one. And you know what Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. <hi>If thou goe on and treasureup wrath,</hi> thou buildest <hi>Iericho,</hi> that thou hast vowed the destruction of. Every time thou takest the Communion, thou trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surest
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:17825:83"/>
up wrath against the day of wrath. For there will be a day of the manifestation of the just wrath of God, and then these things will be laid to thy charge.</p>
                  <p>Let us every one labour to get out of the state of nature, to breake off our wicked lives, and to get into Christ the blessed seed, and then we shall be blessed, we shall be made free, free from the curse of nature, and of sin. Let us renew our Covenants against all sinne, and make conscience to bee lead by the Spirit of Christ, that wee may gather sound Evidence every day, that wee are in Christ, and so out of the Curse.</p>

                  <p>What is the ground of this? what need God stoope thus?</p>
                  <p>There is the same ground for it, as that there is a God; these things goe in an undivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded knot, God.</p>

                  <p>Scriptures might be forced hence to shew the dutie owing from the creature, Man, to God: for the creature must have a ground for what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>o obey. This point might be inlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, but it is a point that doth but make way to
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:17825:86"/>
that that followes, therefore I will not dwell upon it.
<q>Againe in this first part Gods command or war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Observ.</hi> 2. God is willing to be known.</note> seeke yee my face; <hi>you see here,</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>God is willing to be knowne, He is willing to open and discover himselfe; God delights not to hide himselfe: God stands not upon state, as some Emperours doe, that think their presence diminisheth respect: God is no such God, but he may bee searched into. Man, if any weakenesse be discovered, wee can soone search into the depth of his excellencie, but with God it is cleane otherwise, the more we know of him, the more we shall admire him. None admire him more, then the blessed An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, that see most of him, and the blessed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits that have communion with him; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee hides not himselfe, nay hee desires to be knowne, and all those that have his Spirit, desire to make him knowne: Those that sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse the knowledge of God in his will, what he performes for men, and what he requires of them, they are enemies to God, and of Gods people; they suppresse the opening of God, cleane contrary to Gods meaning, <hi>seeke my face,</hi> I desire to be made knowne, and lay open my selfe to you.</p>
                  <p>Therefore we may observe by the way, that <note place="margin">That God doth not shine on us is our owne fault.</note> when wee are in any darke condition, that a Christian finds not the beames of God shining on him, let him not lay the blame upon God,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:17825:87"/>
as if God were a God that delighted to hide himselfe; oh no, it is not his delight, he loves not strangenesse to his poore creature; it is not a point of his policie, hee is too great to affect such poore things: No, the fault is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together in us, we walke not worthy of such a presence, wee want humility and preparation. If there be any darkenesse in the creature, that he finds God doth not so shine on him, as in former times, undoubtedly the cause is in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, for God saith, <hi>seeke my face,</hi> he desires to open himselfe; but it is a point that I will not be large in.</p>
                  <p>We see hence likewise, that 
<q>Gods goodnesse is a Communicative, spreading <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Observ.</hi> 3. Gods goodnes communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</note> goodnesse.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That is peculiar to God, and to those that are lead with the Spirit of God, that are like him, they have a communicative diffsive goodnesse, that loves to spread it selfe, <hi>Seeke my face.</hi> I am good in my selfe, but I desire to shine on you, to impart my goodnesse to you.</p>
                  <p>If God had not a communicative, spread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Or else he had not created the world.</note> goodnesse, hee would never have created the world: the Father, Sonne, and Holy-ghost, were happy in themselves, and enjoyed one another before the world was, but that God delights to communicate, and spread his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, there had never beene a Creation, nor a Redemption. God useth his creatures, not for
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:17825:87"/>
defect of power, that he can do nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them: but for the spreading of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: and thereupon comes all the subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of one creature to another, and all to him.</p>
                  <p>Oh that we had hearts to make way for such a goodnesse, as <hi>God</hi> would cast into us, if wee were as wee should be. <hi>Gods</hi> goodnesse, is a spreading imparting goodnesse. It is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon distinction, there is the goodnesse of the Fountaine, and the goodnesse of the Vessell, that is our goodness, because we contain some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in us that is good: the goodnesse of the creature, that is but the Channell, or the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterne, but the goodnesse of <hi>God</hi> is another manner of goodnesse, the goodnesse of the Fountaine. The Fountaine begs not from the River, the Sunne borrowes not light from the Candle, <hi>God</hi> begs not goodnesse from the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Ours is a borrowed goodnesse, but his is a communicative goodnesse, <hi>seek my face:</hi> that I may impart my goodnesse. The Sun delights to spread his beames, and his influen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> in infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour things, to make all things fruitfull: such a goodnesse is in <hi>God,</hi> as is in a Fountaine, or in the brest that loves to ease it selfe of milke.</p>
                  <p>I note it, that wee may conceive aright of <note place="margin">Gods willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to bestow his goodnesse.</note>

God speakes, and the heart speakes; God speakes to the Heart, and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:17825:89"/>
the Heart speakes to us: And oft times when we heare conscience speaking to us, we neglect it; and as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> said of himselfe, <note place="margin">August.</note> 
                     <hi>God spake often to me, and I was ignorant of it.</hi> When there is no command in the word, that the heart directly thinkes of (as indeed many prophane carelesse men, scarce have a Bible in their houses) <hi>God</hi> speakes to them thus, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science speakes to them some broken com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that they learne against their wils, they heed it not, but <hi>David</hi> did not so, <hi>God</hi> said, <hi>Seekeyee my face,</hi> his heart answers, <hi>thy face Lord will I seeke.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The heart lookes upward to <hi>God,</hi> and then to it selfe: <hi>My heart said]</hi> It said to thee, and then to it selfe: First his heart said to <hi>God,</hi> Lord I have incouragement from thee, thou hast commanded that I should seeke thy face, so his heart looked to <hi>God,</hi> and then it speakes to it selfe, <hi>Thy face Lord will I seeke:</hi> It looks first to <hi>God,</hi> and then to all things that come from it selfe.</p>

                  <p>Betweene the answer of <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Gods</hi> command and warrant; the heart comes to thinke seriously upon the command, and then to enjoyne the dutie. This is to be considered, because there is no knitting of these two toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but by the heart, the serious consideration of the heart, when <hi>God</hi> faith, <hi>seeke my face,</hi> he answers, <hi>I will seeke thy face.</hi> How comes this returne? The soule considers the ground of the returne, before the returne. A man when he doth any thing, hee doth it from the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of a man; a holy man when hee doth a thing, he doth it from the principle of a holy man; and what is the principles and founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the practise of a holy man: a sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed understanding to tell him what God hath said, and what he hath promised, and wherein God hath discovered himselfe.</p>
                  <p>Well, when the heart knowes that once, the heart hath enough from heaven-ward, it hath enough from heaven, God hath said, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised it: then the heart by a worke it hath of it selfe, speaks to it selfe, and to the whole man, to seeke God. The heart will not stoop without reason, the heart of an understanding man, but when it sees the command first, <hi>seeke my face,</hi> then it answers, <hi>thy face Lord will I seeke.</hi> So that this command of God, and this incouragement, and warrant from God, <hi>Seeke yee my face,</hi> it was in <hi>Davids</hi> heart, it was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and set, and grafted in his heart, and then

his heart being awed with the command of God, God hath said thus, the heart goes again to God, thou hast said thus, Lord, <hi>Thy face will I seeke.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>See the depth of <hi>Davids</hi> speech, when hee faith, <hi>Lord thy face will I seeke.</hi> It came from his heart root, not only from the heart, but from the heart grounded upon the command, and incouragement of God. <hi>Seeke my face;</hi> there is the ground, the heart digesting this thorowly, this is <hi>Gods</hi> Command, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it, and understand it from <hi>God,</hi> I see the authority from whence itcomes, therfore I wil stirre up my selfe, <hi>Thy face Lord will I seek:</hi> I shall have occasion to speake somewhat of it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, in the next thing his obedience, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I goe on.

                  <p>Here is his returne againe to <hi>God,</hi> that he will seeke the face of <hi>God,</hi> I will seeke thy face in all my necessities, then I will seeke to thee; and in all thine ordinances I will seeke to thee, whereinsoever thy presence is discovered, thy presence is in all places, especially in thine ordinances, thy presence is in all times, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the time of trouble, and need; in all times of need I will seeke to thee, in all exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences I will seeke unto thee, and in all thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<q>Thy face Lord will I seeke.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here is first of all an Application, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience from Application; they be words of particular Application: <hi>Thy face will I seeke.</hi> God had given him a ground, <hi>Seeke yee my face,</hi> his heart makes the Application, <hi>Thy face I will seeke,</hi> applying the generall incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to himself in particular. So that you may observe hence that, 
<q>The ground of all obedience, of all holy enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Observ.</hi> The ground of obedience, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.</note> with God, is a Spirit of Application.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Applying the truths of God, though (gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally spoken) to our selves in particular. It is spoken here in the plurall number, <hi>Seeke yee my face;</hi> but the generall implies the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, as <hi>London</hi> is in England, <hi>Seeke yee my face,</hi> all yee that are the people of God; but I am one of them: what though I be not named? (that tenent in Popery is against sense) when a man is condemned by the law, is his name in the law? It is against such a fact; hee is a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor: And so the particular is included in the generall, <hi>Seeke yee my face. David</hi> knew that, reason taught him that, and not Religion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="150" facs="tcp:17825:91"/>
Now the ground of Application of divine <note place="margin">1 Gods truth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to all.</note> truths to our selves in particular, is this; that the truth of God (setting aside some circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall things, that arise sometimes to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular persons, that sometimes limit the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to one person, or the promise to one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son (cut off those distinctions) all comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table truths agreeto Gods people in all ages, while there is a Church in the world. Al truths are eternall truths, die not as men doe. <hi>David</hi> is dead, and <hi>Moses</hi> is dead, but this truth is not dead, <hi>Seeke yee my face: Paul</hi> is gone, and <hi>Peter</hi> is gone, we are the <hi>Davids,</hi> and the <hi>Mose's,</hi> the <hi>Peters,</hi> and the <hi>Pauls</hi> now, those truths that were good to them, are good to us. Whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was written before, was written for our comfort. There is an eternall truth that runs through all ages of the Church, that hath an everlasting comfort<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God hath framed the Scriptures not to be limited to the times, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they were written, as the Papists idly speak, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and others, as if they were occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall things, that the Scriptures were written by occasion of such, and such men, and concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned only those times: but the Scriptures were written for all times, and it concernes a times to apply all truths to themselves (setting aside those circumstances, that are applyed to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular men, which are easie to discern) in <hi>Heb.</hi> 13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that that was said to <hi>Iosua, Ios.</hi> 1. the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle applies it to the Church in his time, and to all: <hi>Bee not afraid, I will not faile thee, nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake</hi>
                     <pb n="151" facs="tcp:17825:91"/>
                     <hi>thee,</hi> it is a generall truth. <hi>And Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,</hi> that whosoever beleeves as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> is a sonne of <hi>Abraham.</hi> These truths are universall, and concerne every one, as well as any. And so many other places of Scripture: <hi>The promise of the blessed seed,</hi> the beleeving of it runs from the beginning of the world, in all ages to the comming of Christ. All other promises were but an inlargement of that, that was the Mother-promise; that is the ground of Application, that the generall truths agree to all the Churches. The truth of God is the portion of every child of God, he may claime every promise, and ought to follow the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of every command.</p>
                  <p>The reason is, because al the Church of God are Heires alike; Heires of the Promise, Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> Heires of salvation, they have interest in Christ-alike, in whom all the promises, are <hi>Yea,</hi> and <hi>Amen;</hi> in whom all the promises have their making, and their performance. And by reason that there is an indifferent equality (in regard of the maine things) of all the children of God: they have interest alike in all the benefits by Christ; in all truths, in all substantiall duties to God, and all favours from God, that is the ground of the equity of Application.</p>
                  <p>But if you will have the ground of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity <note place="margin">2 Ground of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.</note> of it, nature will shew that: for the truths are food, if food bee not taken, what
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:17825:92"/>
good doth it doe, without application<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The word of God is a sword: what will a sword doe, if it hangs up in a mans Chamber<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or if it be not used, when the enemy approacheth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Application of the sword of the Spirit gives the vertue to it, it is to no purpose else, divine truths are physick, if it be not applyed, what use is there of physick?</p>
                  <p>There is a necessity (if wee will obey God) of a Spirit of Application; there is nothing that will doe good, but by application, neither in nature, nor in grace: There must bee a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall application at least: the heavens worke upon the earth, there is no Application bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, the heavens are too high; but there is a virtuall Application, there comes light in, and influence to these inferiour bodies: therefore we say the Sunne is in the house, and in the place we are in, though there bee only his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence there. But there must bee application of divine truth to the soule, it must be brought neere the soule, before the soule can moove<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There is a necessity of Application from a principle of nature, to make it our owne.</p>
                  <p>Now as in nature there is a power in the soule, to worke out of the food, that that is good for every member, which we call a dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stive power and faculty; that applies, and as<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>There be <hi>fibra</hi> sucking veines, that suck out of the meat strength, for this and that purpose.
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:17825:92"/>
So there is in the soule of every Christian, and holy man, there is a spirituall sucking, there is a drawing, assimilating digesting Spirit, that digests and drawes out nourishment out of the booke of God, that is fit for him, that hee can say, this is mine, this is for me; I want comfort, and strength, and direction, here it is; I want light, here it is; I am weake, here is supply for it: so there is a digestive power by the Spirit of God in every Christian, to suck, and to draw out of the word, that that is fit for all purposes and turnes, and he can apply the word upon every occasion; as if it be a command, hee obeyes it; if it be a threatning, hee trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles at it; if it be comfort, he rests in it; if it be a direction, hee followes it likewise: Hee applies it answerable to the nature of the word whatsoever it is, his heart is moulded answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the word, by reason of the Spirit of Application.</p>
                  <p>As there is a ground of the Application of <note place="margin">A principle of Application.</note> the word, and a necessity of it; so there is a principle of Application; that is, the Spirit of God in the hearts of the children of <hi>God,</hi> teaching their spirits to draw wholsome truths fitting to themselves, and none but the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God can doe it, that have the Spirit of God, they cannot apply the word of God aright. False Application of the word of God, is the cause of all mischiefe sometimes, when those that apply the law, should apply the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel; and on the contrary, when those that
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:17825:93"/>
should apply the law, sinfull secure persons, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Gospel. Many times poore distressed persons, that comfort belongs to, <hi>Oh comfort my people,</hi> they apply the Law that belongs not to them, in that case false application is the ground of mischiefe; therefore the Spirit of God is the principle of Application of divine truths, according to the exigence, and estate of Gods people.</p>
                  <p>Therefore wee should be stirred up to beg <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> To beg the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> the Spirit of Application, to maintaine our communion, and entercourse with God, that we may apply every thing duely, and truly to our selvs, &amp; our own foules; all is to no purpose else, if we do not apply it: if it be not brought home to our soules, and digested throughly in our hearts, wee must say, this is from God, and this belongs to me; when we heare truths unfolded, to say of our selves, this concernes me; and say not, this is a good portion, and a good truth for such a one, and such a one, but every one take out his owne portion, this is for me. God saith, <hi>Seeke my face, thy face Lord will I seeke,</hi> with a spirit of Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>If wee doe not, as indeed it is the fault of the times, to heare the word of God loosely; wee care not so much to heare the word of God, as to heare the gifts of men, wee desire to heare fine things to increase notions, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in them, and to heare some empty crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to fasten upon a storie, or some phrases by

the by) alas you come here to heare duties, and comforts, if you be good, and sentences against you, if you be naught, wee speak Gods threatnings to you, that will wound you to hell, except you pull them out by repentance.

                  <p>This is that that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> hath in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.</note> that that doth all in Baptisme, it is not, <hi>the washing of the filth of the body,</hi> but the <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>In Baptisme, dost thou beleeve, saith the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, in God the Father Almighty? I doe beleeve, that was the answer: dost thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in God the Son?

spoken to that heart before, and there is obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to purpose; <hi>Thy face will I seeke,</hi> it is that that brings comfort, not the washing of the water, it is not the eating of the bread, and drinking the wine, and hearing the word of <hi>God,</hi> when there is not the answer of a good conscience; when we say we beleeve, and we will doe this, to doe it indeed, Lord I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, I will goe out of the Church with a purpose to practise what I heare.

                  <p>Our obedience must be sutable, and answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, as I said before, if it be a direction, to follow it; if it be a command to obey it; if it be a threatning, to feare it; if it be a comfort, a promise, to rest upon it: Let there be a suta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse of obedience to the word, thereafter as the word is.

                  <p>First of all, seeking implyes observance, <note place="margin">1. Observance.</note> seeke my face, that is, observe me, respect me as a God. Thy face I will seeke, I will bee a follower of thee; As in English an observer is a follower, a creature, It is a proud word: as if man could make a man of nothing. And indeed they are creatures in that kind, they are raysed of nothing. To seeke a man is to observe him, there is a notable place for it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 29. 26. <hi>Many seeke the rulers favour.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 29. 26.</note> In the Greeke translation, the Septuagint the word is, to observe, and respect a man, which is translated seeking. Many observe the ruler, but every mans judgement commeth from the Lord. You see, those that thinke to rise by the favour of such or such a man, they will be his followers, as I said, and observe him, they stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die men: as those that rise by favour that way, they study not bookes so much as men, what may delight such a man what hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects; surely they will serve him at every

turne. A base Atheist makes a man his god; that he may rise, he will deny God and the motions of Conscience, and honesty, and all to observe the face of a great man whom hee hopes to rise by: but a true Christian observes the great God, the greatest preferment comes from him; so it signifies to observe.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Psalme</hi> 62. there you shall see the ground <note place="margin">Psalme 62.</note> of observation is that power belongs to God. <hi>I have heard once, nay twise.</hi> Hee heard it twise by the meditation of it by going over it in his heart againe.

We may heare a truth a hundred times, that is, by meditating of it, <hi>I have heard once nay twice, that power belongs to God,</hi> that is, riches and power to advance a man. Atheisticall men thinke, all belongs to the creature, but power belongs to God. That is one thing that is meant by seeking, diligent observing of GOD, and respect to him and his will and commandements in all things.</p>
                  <p>If so be that a person of great place should say, observe me, and I will prefer you, I hope men would bee ready enough, they need no more words: Here is the Atheisme of our hearts, God saith, I will doe all good for you; the greatest preferment is to bee the child of GOD here; and the heire of heaven after.

                  <p>Then, in the third place. <hi>Seeke my face,</hi> that <note place="margin">3 Seeke Gods favour.</note> is, seek my favour, and grace; favour appeares and shines in the face: <hi>Seeke my face,</hi> observe me, depend on me, for what? for my favour. What is that? It is all, if we have the grace of God, we have all: for the grace of God is in every thing that is good to us. If we have the graces to salvation, they come of free grace: every good gift is the grace of God.

So in seeking, we must observe God, and depend upon him, and for what? for his favour espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially: for the face, and favour of God; let me have a good looke from thee oh Lord, let me have thy favour and love, for other things I leave them to thy wisdome, thou art wise

                  <p>Oh this favour and face of <hi>God</hi> it is a sweet thing, this presence of <hi>God.</hi> What is heaven, but the presence of <hi>God</hi> there? Let <hi>God</hi> be present in a dungeon, it will be a paradise; let <hi>God</hi> be absent, Paradise, it is as a hell or dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, as it was to <hi>Adam;</hi> after he had sinned he runne to hide himselfe.

                  <p>Againe to seeke the face of <hi>God,</hi> is to pray to him, to put this in execution in prayer: eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <note place="margin">To pray to him</note> where in Scripture, it is all one, to pray, and to seeke <hi>Gods</hi> face, it is called the spirit of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: which because I have spoken of at large out of another Scripture, I will now say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it.</p>

therefore seeking the face of God is to attend upon Gods ordinance. <hi>I will seeke thy face,</hi> that is, wheresoever there is any presence of thee, I will seeke thee.</p>
                  <p>Christ when hee was lost, hee was found in the Temple: that hath a literall sence, but it is true in a spirituall sence; if we loose <hi>Christ,</hi> and have not comfort from Christ, we shall find him in the Temple, the sweetest presence of his spirit is there. His body is in heaven, and his spirit is his Vicar in the world: if we want comfort and direction from Christ, we shall meete him in the Temple: there he gives us sweet meetings by his spirit; there we have the comfort, and direction, and spirituall strength that wee wanted before wee came. There is the best meeting. As in the <hi>Canticles,</hi> Christ goes into the <hi>Garden of spices.</hi> He goes among his children, that are as a watred gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and as so many plants of righteousnesse, and beddes of spices; he delights to be there.

                     <note place="margin">To know God in Christ.</note> For there is enmity betweene the nature of God, and the nature of man, of sinfull man: but that Christ hath taken our nature now and made it lovely to God, and God lovely to us.

Christ <hi>Emanuell,</hi> God, and man, <hi>God with us,</hi> hath made God and us friends: therefore now we must go to God in that <hi>Emanuel,</hi> in Christ, that Ladder that joynes heaven and earth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.

                  </p>
                  <p>In the next place when we goe to God, and seeke to <hi>God,</hi> be sure to seeke his favour, and <note place="margin">2.

If we want any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular thing, protection, or direction, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in distresse, goe not for that in the first place, but let us see in what tearmes <hi>God</hi> and we are; let us be sure that reconciliation, and peace be made. For if we seeke to <hi>God</hi> in our particular wants, and have not made our peace before, but have sought to other gods, to men, and to our shifts, <hi>God</hi> may say, you seeke to me? Goe to the gods you have served, to the great men you have served, to the riches you have trusted unto, goe to your shifts. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore first, make peace and reconciliation with <hi>God</hi> before you seeke other things. If a man have offended a great person, he doth not goe and seeke particular favours, till first he have made peace and taken up the quarrell. Let us take up the quarrell between <hi>God</hi> and us by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and a promise of new obedience, get reconciliation that way, and then seeke for particular favours after.</p>

                     <pb n="182" facs="tcp:17825:107"/>
For what if <hi>God</hi> give you particular favours, if they bee not from his grace and favour, what will they doe us good? What will all that a reprobate wretch hath doe him good? What will his favours, his riches, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and preferments doe him good when he dies, when hee shall conflict with the anger of God? when he shall see hell before him, and see heaven shut?

                  </p>
                  <p>And then for particular things goe to him as the exigence is: for in <hi>God</hi> there is a supply for all turnes; and that is the ground of seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: for our seeking, it must be a wise seeking: now it were not wise, unlesse there were a supplie in <hi>God</hi> for every want whatsoever it is.

In anger, <hi>God</hi> may let a man enjoy favours, as the fruits of his displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, but what can they doe without him? They can doe nothing. Therefore it must be

the supreame cause, the highest cause, the great wheele that turnes every little inferiour wheele in the world, they turne with the great wheele of divine providence, and goodnesse, therefore goe to him as the first cause.</p>

                     </gap> is a blessed grace; by it we live, by it we stand, by it we conquer, and resist, by it we indure, by it we die, by it we do all those worthy mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters we doe, in spight of the devill, and his kingdome: this is that excellent grace of faith by which we live, and by which we die. 
<q>These all died in faith.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>For they lived as they died, and died as they <note place="margin">As men live so they die.</note> lived. It is a usuall generall rule, as men live so they die, he that lives by faith, dies by faith; he that lives prophanely, dies prophanely. If we suffer the devill to lead us and abuse us all the time of our life, we must thinke God in just judgement will give us up, that he shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude us, and abuse us at the houre of death. Carnall confidence disposeth men, to thinke they shall step our of their filthy blasphemous course of life, out of their sinfull cursed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to leape to heaven presently, it is no such matter. Alas, heaven it must be entred into on earth; there must bee a fiting and preparing
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:17825:121"/>
time on earth for heaven: we must looke to die as we live. There is but one example of a man that died by faith that did not live by faith, that is, the good thiefe, and yet that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time of life we see how fruitfull it was: but the rule is, all that will die in faith must live in faith; and usually men are affected, and dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and their speeches, and carriage are on their death bed as they were when they lived, GOD in just judgment giving them up to that course.</p>
                  <p>Many wish that they may live in popery, and enjoy the liberty of that carnall religion, but they would not die by that religion; they live by that religion, and die by ours, when they have had the sweetnesse and liberty that is given them there to sin, and then open all in confession and be cleane, and then sin againe, and such easie courses they have that betrayes thousands of soules to damnation: Now this is their course, when conscience is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened they flie to savation by CHRIST, if they understand any thing at all, or else they die desperate, if they looke to be saved by that religion as they live by it: if we look to die by faith, we must live by it. 
<q>These all died in faith, not having received the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>For God promised them Canaan, and they died many hundred yeares before, their poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:17825:122"/>
came into Canaan; hee promised them Christ, and they died long before Christ came; he promised them heaven, and they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred not into heaven till death, so they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not the promises, that is, they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not the things promised; for else they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the promise, but not that that was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised; they received not the type, Canaan, not the things typified; Christ, and heaven. This is added as a commendation of their faith, that though they received not the things that they looked for, yet notwithstanding they had such a strong faith that they continued to live by faith, and died in faith. The promises here are taken for the blessed things promised.</p>
                  <p>This should teach us this lesson, that Gods promises are not emptie shells, they are reall things. And then whatsoever God promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth <note place="margin">God deales with men by promises.</note> it is not barely propounded to the soule but in a promise, it is wrapped up in a promise: hee gives us not emptie promises nor naked things, but hee gives us promises of things which we must exercise our faith in, in depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon him for the performance of them till we be put in possession. For here all the blessings they looked for, is wrapped up in the name promises; they received <hi>not the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;</hi> the meaning is, they received not <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan;</hi> they received not Christ in the flesh, not life everlasting. Now the believing soule, it lookes upon all the good things that it looks for from God, not nakedly, but as they
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:17825:122"/>
are involved, and wrapped, and lapped up in promises, it must have a word for it, it looks to GODS word. For the soule looks not now immediately as it shall doe in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, it looks not to God, and to Christ direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: but it lookes to Christ and heaven, and happinesse, as it is in a promise. It dares not expect any thing of God but by a promise. Alas the guiltie soule, how dares it look God in the face but by a promise? except he have ingaged himselfe by promise, and he hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged himselfe by promise that he will doe it, he hath pawned his faithfulnesse that he will doe it: and then the soule lookes to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, and in that it looks to Christ, and grace, and heaven, and happines, and all good things.</p>
                  <p>A presumptuous idle person that knowes not <note place="margin">Faith lookes on God by the promise.</note> what God is, that he is a <hi>consuming fire,</hi> he ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth into Gods presence. Faith dares not go to God but first it pleads his word to him, it pleads his promise to him; it lookes on God by a promise. The very phrase inforceth this upon us that we should make great account of the promises, because we have all good wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in them. The promises are the swadling clouts; Christ, and Heaven, is wrappped in them. And when wee have a promise, let us thinke we are rich indeed, for God will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme his promise. From the promise then the soule goes to the nature of GOD, then it thinkes of his justice, his justice ties him to performe it; it thinkes of his mercie,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:17825:123"/>
and truth, <hi>faithfull it hee that hath promised.</hi> Then it thinkes of that great name <hi>Iehovah,</hi> that gives being to the world, gives being to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> things, nay, and that will turne all things that are now to nothing, as when they were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing he gave them being at the first: that <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah</hi> hath made these promises of life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting, of necessary grace to bring us thither, he hath made a promise of perseverance, and of comfort under the crosse, and affliction, a promise of provision, and the like. That great God <hi>Iehovah</hi> that gave being to all is faithfull, he hath bound himselfe, he hath laid his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse to pawne, that he will make all good, that is here promised. The soule after it sees the promise it riseth up, and lookes to God. <hi>They received not the promises,</hi> that is, the things promised, so much I desire to observe from the phrase.

We see the Prophet <hi>Esay,</hi> and the rest, how oft they inculcate the same promises of comfort, to the people in captivity concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their deliverance out of it; they repeate it againe, and againe: the same reason should enforce the soule to have recourse to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises againe, and againe.</p>

Now there are two wayes of things being present. One is when the things themselves be present, that is, when we shall be in heaven, and enjoy Christ, and all the joyes of heaven; then the things are present themselves. And then there is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of faith, when faith apprehends the things promised to us as present; faith makes the things present in somesort, not in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects: for then faith were all one with vision, and possession: but in regard of certainty they are present, and in regard of sound comfort: therefore God gives other graces, betweene faith, and possession, to strengthen and enable faith that it doe not sinke in the worke, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween faith, and the full possession of the good things we believe, we have patience, and hope, and many other sweete graces; but all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the soule comfortably to waite for the accomplishment of the things beleeved. Now though the presence of faith affect not so much as the presence of sight: yet it doth affect.

What is the reason that a holy man is so much affected with heavenly things, hee feeles no more joy many times than a wicked man? It is the nature of faith that so represents them to him, and sets before his eyes the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie of the things that hee sees them as present.</p>
                  <p>Faith, hath her eye, faith hath her sences, <note place="margin">What kind of eye faith hath.</note> faith hath feete of her owne, whereby shee goes to Christ: faith hath armes of her owne to graspe, and to claspe Christ.

Reason sees more then sence, but faith sees more than reason. Faith sees the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the body, faith sees the glory in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that all the eyes in the world cannot see.

Faith is a further light, a light beyond all, a supernaturall heavenly light, and sight, it sees beyond all other eyes, beyond the eye of the body, or beyond the other eye of the soule, which is reason.</p>
                  <p>Now this worke of faith is called sight, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong <note place="margin">Sight of faith quicke.</note> other respects for this, that sight is the most capacious, and comprehending sence; it apprehends its object quickly, and sight it works upon the affections, so faith hath a quick eye sight, it pierceth through the darke things of the world, it pierceth through contraries. Gods children, though they see their estate oft times contrary to the promise, as if God did not regard them: yet they breake through that. You know Gods manner of working is in contrary estates, when we die, faith sees life; when we most apprehend our sins, faith sees the forgivenesse of sinnes: when we are
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:17825:128"/>

As in sight there is both the light outward, and a light in the eye, and the application of the light in the eye to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: so in faith there is a light in the things revealed, a promise, and discovery of it by the light of the Gospell, and an inward light in the soule, answerable to the inward light in the eye: for a dead eye sees nothing, and a quick living eye sees nothing without the light of the ayre. So there is a double revelation, by the word, and by the spirit: the spirit works an eye of faith in the soule, and then it disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers to it the things of God. 
<q>They saw them a farre off.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>God created a new eye in the soule, a new sight which they had not by nature: for even as the natural eye cannot see things that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible; so the naturall man cannot see the things of God, which are seene not by a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, but by a supernaturall eye, <hi>eye hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

that must see things a farre off, it must bee a supernaturall eye; and the light that must discover them must be the light of Gods truth: for reason cannot see the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the body, and the life to come, and such glorious things as the word of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veales to us.</p>

As a man may see an earthly thing with a heavenly eye: because he sees God in it, and there is somewhat of God in it to lead him to see him: so a man may see heavenly things with a carnall eye, as <hi>Balaam wished to die the death of the righteous.</hi> A carnall man may be ravished with heavenly things; but he must look upon them as things sutable, or else all is to no purpose.</p>

                  <p>When the things are farre of that we see, then if the eye see them it is a strong sight: a weake eye cannot see a farre off.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, when there are clouds betweene though the things be neare; yet when there are clouds betweene, to breake, and pierce through them, there must be a strong sight.</p>
                  <p>Then thirdly, when there is but a little light; when there are many obstacles in the middest, and to breake through all by a little light to seethings remote, here is a strong eye, and this was the sight of these blessed men, they had a strong eye.</p>
                  <p>For the things they looked on were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, a farre off, diverse thousands of yeares <note place="margin">1 When the thing seene is farre off.</note> they saw Christ by faith: the soule mounted up on the wing of faith, it flew over many thousands of yeares in a moment, and see Christ the Messias, and see heaven it selfe typi fied in <hi>Canaan.</hi> So swift is the eye of faith, it mounts over all in a moment.

                  <p>And then betweene them, and that they <note place="margin">2 When there are clouds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene.</note> looked to what difficulties were there? Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>Abraham</hi> who was a type of Christ, how many difficulties had he? besides other of the Patriarchs. We see God commanded him to slay his sonne, a command (one would thinke)
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:17825:130"/>
against reason, against affection, against hope, it was faith against faith as it were, It was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst reason in the eye of flesh. Now in this case to strive against all these difficulties, what a many clouds must <hi>Abraham</hi> breake through here, against sense, and against affection, hee must <hi>hope against hope,</hi> hee must have faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst faith, he must deny affection, hee must goe and take his only begotten son <hi>Isaac,</hi> and he must be the executioner and butcher him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe and slay him for a sacrifice; Here must be a strong faith in the power of God, that must see God raysing <hi>Isaac</hi> from the dead, as he did after a sort: for when he was bound for a sacrifice ready to bee slaine, he caused a Ramme to be taken in the thicket, and to be offered, and <hi>Isaac</hi> escaped. It was a strong faith to breake through all these. Indeed blessed <hi>Abraham</hi> saw more excellency, and power in the work of God then in his beloved <hi>Isaac.</hi> So faith that is strong it sees more comfort, and joy, and matter of benefit and blessing to the soule in the promises, and in the word of God then in <hi>Isaac,</hi> that is, then in the dearest thing in our owne account that we have, that the faithfull soule had rather part with all then with God: it will not part with his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses for all that is in the earth, not for the dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest thing in this world, <hi>Isaac</hi> shall goe rather.</p>
                  <p>Then for their light to goe by it was but <note place="margin">3 When there is little light.</note> little, what a little light had they? <hi>Answ.</hi> Promises, they saw things in types, and glasses,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:17825:130"/>
a few promises, and what was that they sought? A heritage farre off. Wee on the contrary have all set nearer hand that may helpe us, but wee have a weaker faith. One would thinke it should greatly help us to lead our lives till we come to heaven: for that that we believe is nearer, heaven is nearer, how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle a time is betweene us, and the day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? how little a time betweene us, and the glory that is to be revealed? For the clouds that we have betweene they are none in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring our light with theirs. How many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises have we discovered before hand? we have Christ come in the flesh and risen again: we have the <hi>Gentiles</hi> called, and all these things we have light upon light: we have larger pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, and a larger unfolding of divine truths; the Canon is inlarged, the Bible is enlarged, more than it was then; there are many books added, and the New Testament. Now how doth it come to passe that we see not so well as they, nor so strongly as they? I answer, the reason is this, their light was lesse, but their sight was stronger, we have more light, and lesse sight; we have things nearer, but our sight is weaker. (the more shame for us) A strong eye may see a farre off by a little light. When a weake eye cannot see so farre by a greater light. The eye of their soule, the eye of faith was stronger, and more light some: the spirit of God was stronger in <hi>Abraham,</hi> but his light of revelation was lesser; he had
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:17825:131"/>
fewer promises: for he desired to see Christs day, and saw it not.</p>
                  <p>So it is with Christians sometimes, when there is a great strength of faith, yet it may be there is not so much light: a weake Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian may have more light, but he hath a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er eye, and he in that respect sees better then a stronger. To a stronger God doth not disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to him so much outwardly sometimes su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to his inward, Gods dispensations are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse in this kind.</p>

And then the outward things of the world, they are cast into the eyes, we must take heed of these inward, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward lets, take heed of Sathan, that he doe not with outward objects bewitch us.

Now as God hath his prospective glasses, to see a farre off; so the Devill hath prospective glasses, that when things are neare he makes them seene a farre off (as such glas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses there are too) when death, and danger, and damnation are nea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

I may live so many yeares, and enjoy my plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and my will. Now this is but a false glasse, the devill abuseth them: for your life is but a death, and when we begin to live we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to die: why should we account therefore of the time to come? death and life goe in equall pace one with another, everyday we live so much is taken from our life; and then the cutting off of all is uncertaine: let us take heed that Satan blind us not.</p>
                  <p>And withall desire God to open our eyes <note place="margin">2 Desire God to open our eyes.</note> every day, to take the scales from the eye of our soules, that we may see the promises, that we may see Christ, that we may see God shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning on us in Christ: that he would take away the vaile from the things by exposition, that he would open the truth to us by his Ministers: and that hee would take away the vaile from

our hearts, that our hearts may joyne with the things. That when by ministeriall meanes the things are cleare, that there may not be a vaile of infidelity on our hearts, but that our hearts may sweetly joyne with them. Let us begge daily that GOD would take away the things that hinder, inward and outward, that we may see the things a farre off: that we may not be as <hi>Peter</hi> saith, mop eyed, that wee cannot see a farre off, but that we may set heaven before our eyes, and the judgement and the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to come, that we may see, and view and eye those things by faith, and that wee may square our lives answerable.</p>
                  <p>Then againe to helpe our sight of Christ, and happinesse, let us get a fresh sight of our <note place="margin">3 Get a sight of corruption.</note> corruption, and sinne every day: let us every day look on that terrifying object of our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of nature hang it in the eye of our soules as an odious object to humble us.

                  <p>Let us see what need we stand in of Christ: the view of our corruptions will make us glad

                  <p>It was such a sight of the things as was <note place="margin">Perswasion fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes sight.</note> with convincing; with perswasion. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this followes well upon sight: for sight of all other sences perswades best: hearing is not so perswasive as sight: supernaturall sight: brings forth supernaturall perswasion. Sight is a convincing sense even outward sight: so inward sight it is a convincing thing it perswades, and sets downe the soule that a thing is so, when a man sees it. All the men in <note place="margin">Sight convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth.</note> the world cannot perswade the weakest man in the world, when it is day, or night; when the sunne shines, or it is darke, that it is not so: when he sees it, he will believe his owne eyes more than all the world besides. And as it is in sensible things, we believe our owne eyes: so much more in spirituall things we believe our eyes. When there is a spirituall light of
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:17825:133"/>
revelation in the word discovering such things, and also to spirituall light a spirituall eye: when the spirit puts an eye into the soule to see supernaturall things that reason cannot attaine to; then there is perswasion: though all the world should perswade the soule that such a thing were not so, it would say it is so, it will believe its owne eyes. If all the world should perswade a Christian that there is no such excellency in religion, that his wayes are not good, that he is but foolish, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he knowes the contrary, and will not be scorned out of his religion, and driven out of it by any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary perswasion of men whom hee pitties (though perhaps they are otherwise beyond him) in the state of nature: for sight it is a convincing thing.</p>
                  <p>Especially when there is some taste with <note place="margin">Especially with taste.</note> sight: for tast together with sight convince <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> of the goodnesse of things; as we see in those that lead their life by tasting and feeling. The creatures maintaine their life by tasting some proportionable food fit for them. So a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, when once hee hath tasted of spirituall things, the proper food of his soule, when he hath seene, and tasted of them, he will never be driven out of his religion, and his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="233" facs="tcp:17825:133"/>
and therefore wee see that after sight comes perswasion.</p>
                  <p>Now this perswasion is a supernaturall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion, <note place="margin">Perswasion su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall.</note> and it is <list>
                        <item>Generall,</item>
                        <item>Particular.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>A generall perswasion of the things, of the generall truths, and a particular personall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion of our interest in them. When wee are perswaded that the truths are so, general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that are revealed in the word of God; and when we are perswaded by the help of the spirit that wee have a particular interest in them, a portion in them. And both are here meant. <hi>They see them a farre off, and were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded of them,</hi> they were convinced both of the truth, and goodnesse of them: and of the truth and goodnesse to them in particular.</p>
                  <p>Now perswasion is a setled kind of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. <note place="margin">Perswasion what.</note> Perswasion comes diverse wayes, there be diverse degrees tending to perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. <note place="margin">Degrees to perswasion.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, the poorest degree of the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of things, is conjecture; a guessing that <note place="margin">1 Conjecture.</note> such a thing may bee so or otherwise, but I guesse it rather to be so.</p>
                  <p>Beyond conjecture there is opinion, when a man thinkes it is so, upon more reasons <note place="margin">2 Opinion.</note> swaying him one way: and yet in opinion there is feare on the contrary that it may bee otherwise.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="234" facs="tcp:17825:134"/>
And the third degree beyond opinion is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine knowledge, when a man is not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited, <note place="margin">3 Knowledge from argument</note> that the thing is so, his opinion is so up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on some reasons inducing him; but hee knowes it by arguments, and reasons: that is science and knowledge, when the mind is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded by arguments; but that is not so much here meant, the perswasion by argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>There is another degree then, of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <note place="margin">4 Perswasion from authority of the speaker.</note> which is by the authority of the speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, a perswasion from thence: when I know not the thing by the light of the thing so much, because I see the reason of the thing; but because I know such a one saith it; that is the perswasion of faith. When one is perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of a thing not so much out of his owne knowledge, out of the principles of the thing; setting out the causes of the thing, as out of the credite of the person that speakes. Now this perswasion riseth out of faith in the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the person, when I believe a thing for the authority of the speaker: it ariseth from the knowledge of him that speakes; that he is able, and that hee is true and that he is honest, and good: that he will not deceive because he is good, and he will not bee deceived because he is wise; we conceive that he is wise, and holy, and able with all, one that we trust. If together with this knowledge and perswasion, from the authority, and truth, and goodnesse and wisdome of the speaker, there be joy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ed
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:17825:134"/>
sense and experience, we see it proved; and when there is experience, there is reason why <note place="margin">And some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.</note> wee should believe that he saith because wee have found the thing to be so. So when there is both the authority of the speaker, and some inward sense, some sight, and taste, and feeling, and experience of the thing spoken; here comes that setled perswasion: for hee is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly true that hath spoken it, and I have found in some degree the thing true that hee hath spoken. Now both are here meant in some degrees, <hi>they saw the things a farre off,</hi> both by the authority of the promise; as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise by their owne sight, and some taste they had.</p>
                  <p>For God reserves not all for heaven, God gives his children some taste, and feeling, some little joy, and comfort; the <hi>first fruits of the spirit</hi> here. So they were perswaded, from the authority of the speaker, and some sense, and feeling of the thing in somemeasure.</p>
                  <p>Now this perswasion hath its degrees. <note place="margin">Degrees in this perswasion.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a full perswasion.</p>
                  <p>And there is a perswasion that is not so full that is growing to further perswasion still.</p>
                  <p>And this perswasion hath degrees, both in the generall perswasion, of the truths them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and in their particular interest: for all Christians are not alike perswaded of divine truths themselves, nor all Christians are not a like perswaded of their particular interest in those truths. There bee degrees in both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects.
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:17825:135"/>
For the things themselves, wee may <note place="margin">1. In generall.</note> grow stronger, and stronger perswaded: even as the light, and our eye growes clearer, the stronger is our sight: so our perswasion while we are here may grow stronger, and stronger. It was strong in <hi>Abraham;</hi> yet not so uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formely strong, but that it was weaker some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times then others, as we see in the story. And <note place="margin">2. Particular.</note> so for particular perswasion, the spirit of God may give assurance that may bee shaken, I but he recovers himselfe presently: the tenour of a Christians life is usually a state of fight, and perswasion, when he is himselfe, and when he remembers his owne principles.</p>
                  <p>To come particularly, you see here that, 
<q>Spirituall perswasion is necessary. <note place="margin">Spirituall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary.</note>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Both of the things in generall, and of our interest in them.</p>
                  <p>It may bee asked whether there may be <note place="margin">Quest.</note> a perswasion of the truth in generall, without a perswasion of our owne particular interest in them?</p>
                  <p>I answer no; not a sound, undoubted spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Sound perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is with particular inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest. Conviction double.</note> perswasion. There is a double conviction, a conviction when a man cannot tell what to say against it: but spirituall conviction is when a man is convinced of the truth, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>he thing, and this alwayes drawes the other with it, first or last. A man may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that he cannot tell what to say against
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:17825:135"/>
the truth, but that is not properly perswasion. A man is perswaded by divine truth that all the promises a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>e true in the Gospell, and it draws with it a particular light: he sees, and is perswaded of his owne interest in it, first or last: for a strong perswasion of divine truth, of Gods word; when I know it is Gods word, it workes in my flesh, it changeth me, it lifts me up, it casts me down, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian knowes that the word of GOD is the word of GOD by a spirituall perswasion wrought by the efficacy of the word; from an intrinse call principle in the word it selfe.</p>
                  <p>But sometimes it fals out that a Christian may be convinced of the truth of the word in generall that it is Gods word, and that the promises of salvation are true, and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding he may not feele the particular perswasion of the forgivenesse of his sinnes, and of his acceptation to life everlasting, and his interest in Christ; these two are somtimes separable in regard of feeling. A Christian hath alway a perswasion of the truth of GOD, of the things, but hee hath not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way a like perswasion of his owne interest in them.</p>
                  <p>How doe you prove that these are severed <note place="margin">Quest.</note> sometimes.</p>
                  <p>Thus; There is the birth, and infancy of a <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times weake.</note> Christian; when a Christian is in his birth, he is not perswaded of his owne good estate, as hee is after when hee is growne, then hee
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:17825:136"/>
knowes his estate. A soule that is in the state of grace that hungers and thirsts after good things, at that time it may be it is not acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that it shall be satisfied, it is not acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, of its owne interest, but stretcheth it selfe forward for intire satisfaction, and it shall be satisfied: that is, the soule that hungers, and thirsts after the perswasion of GODS love in <hi>Christ,</hi> and the forgivenesse of sinnes, and life everlasting, there is never soule that thus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and thirsts but God satisfies it at length, for the most part in this world, or else certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the world to come forever. But alway where there is this perswasion supernaturall, that the word of GOD is true indeed, that there is salvation to all true believers, when it is wrought by the spirit; there is either a perswasion of our interest, or somewhat ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to perswasion, some hungering and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, some desire that God accepts for the deed, to shew that such a man is in the state of grace.</p>
                  <p>I speake this the rather, because some are deceived in their owne estates, they doe not conceive aright of themselves, they thinke they are not in the state of grace when they find not that particular, strong assured perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
                  <p>I answer they may be in the state of grace <note place="margin">God suspends the knowledge of being in a good estate.</note> notwithstanding. A Christian knowes not his owne estate alway, at all times. It is one grace to bee in a good estate, and another to
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:17825:136"/>
have the knowledge of it, they bee different gifts of God, and God suspends the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a mans being in a good estate, for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall ends.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes, among the rest for this one, to humble us, to keepe us from security, to make <note place="margin">1 To humble us.</note> us carefull, and diligent; to make us know that hee hath the keeping of our feeling and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion in his owne hands. As hee hath the keeping of all our grace, so he hath the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the knowledge that we have grace, and of our comfortable walking, that wee may know we have every thing from him, both grace, and the feeling of grace: and if wee take liberty to our selves, hee will take libertie, to keepe our feeling at that time: to make us humble, and to make us seeke reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation againe, It is one part of <hi>Gods</hi> dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with his children, to hinder their perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their particular interest sometimes.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes the children of God may be in such a condition; as that they may thinke for a time in their judgement, that they bee in a contrary esta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>e; they are misperswaded of themselves, not to bee Gods children (as it were) God may suffer this, that they shall not only have a weake staggering perswasion, but a perswasion to the contrary though it bee a false perswasion.</p>
                  <p>But how shall they know that they are <hi>Gods</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Quest.</note> children at that time? They say they are so shaken, and at a stand, they are so conceited
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:17825:137"/>
that they are none of Gods: that God hath left them, and forsaken them.</p>
                  <p>You may know it by this, that at the same <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> How to know Gods children in losse of as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance.</note> time they are conscionable of al heavenly du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, at the same time, they neglect no meanes of salvation: at the same time they complaine against their owne corrupt course of life that hath given God occasion to leave them thus to themselves, at the same time they strive against this, and labour to be perswaded of GODS truths in generall. And though the devill sometimes shake that perswasion, that Gods truth is not Gods truth, and make them questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whether it be the word of God or no, and whether there bee such a thing as life everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting: (the devill shakes us in principles some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times) but yet a Christian in such temptations, though he be shaken in his principles by the force of wickednesse, yet he attends upon the meanes, and goes on more conscionably, he doth not give backe, but labours for satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and further setling still, and is ashamed of himselfe that hee should have such beastly thoughts as the Psalmist saith, <hi>so foolish was I</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Psalme 73.</note> 
                     <hi>and ignorant, and as a beast before thee,</hi> when hee began to stagger in the principle of the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God. So sometimes a Christian is brought, to stagger in principles, in the maine generall perswasion of the word of God, but he likes not himselfe, he accounts himselfe as a beast, and labours for satisfaction still in san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified meanes and never gives over; Though
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:17825:137"/>
he have not particular perswasion, he gives not over holy duties, but goes on in spirituall du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, he labours to obey God in all things, he is conscionable to God, in feare and trembling in the least thing. A man may say to such a soule, it shall finde peace at the length: for Gods wayes are unsearchable: GOD hath cause, and reason why he keepes such a soule under for a time, and withholds some sense and perswasion: but usually GODS com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts come more abundantly to such a soule, he reserves it for the time of affliction, or the houre of death.</p>
                  <p>The truth is, it is a constant rule, that though <note place="margin">Vsually Gods children have particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion.</note> it may be thus with some in some cases: yet ordinarily Gods children may be perswaded of their particular condition; yea, and they ought to labour after this perswasion, and assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that their soules may be filled with mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and fatnesse, and that they may joy in God, and have boldnesse to come before God in prayer, that they may be fruitfull in all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly duties: that they may be strong to suffer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, and to resist temptations. Therefore though God sometimes in his wise dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, suffer them to be hindred: yet not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing this is a thing that is both attainable, and that they ought to labour for, and never give their hearts rest till they attaine to it.</p>
                  <p>I say wee ought to labour for it: for the soule is never in such a frame as it ought to be but when it hath gotten some assurance of
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:17825:138"/>
Gods love. But I must adde this; we must la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour that this perswasion be supernaturall by the spirit of God, both of the truths in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, of the promises in generall, and of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in particular in them, we must labour that it be by the spirit to our spirits, that the spirit may seale them to our spirits. For it is not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to know the word of God to be the word of God, and the promises, to be the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, because we have beene brought up in them, and can say them by heart, and it were a shame for us to conceive the contrary, that is not sufficient: for that will deceive us. Wee must labour (as I said of knowledge, that we may be supernaturally convinced, so also that is from that knowledge,) that it may be spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, or else it will deceive us.</p>
                  <p>How doe we prove that? <note place="margin">Quest.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>To make it a little clearer, because it is a <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> If perswasion be not superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall.</note> point of some consequence, even as I shewed of what consequence the sight of faith is: so I may say of this perswasion. We must labour therefore to know how we come by this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion, and whether it be such as we can hold out in, whether it be such by which wee can stand out in the time of temptation. If there be nothing but that argument of breeding, and of generall light, of discourse, that we see one thing how it followes from another: I say it will deceive us: because constant obedience will never follow upon such a perswasion; nor constant holding out to death, nor constancy
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:17825:138"/>
in death (if the conscience be once awaked) neither will wee be fruitfull in our lives, and conversations. To make this cleare.</p>
                  <p>If the soule be not perswaded by the spirit <note place="margin">1 There will not be obedience.</note> of God, together with the spirit of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for the same spirit that is in the Scripture, must be in our spirit, working our natures su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the Scriptures to be holy: if we doe not by that spirit by which the Scripture was endited, know those truths, we shall never be obedient to them, not constantly. For what is the reason, that men when they are told, God doth forbid you to take his name in vaine; <hi>God</hi> forbids you to seeke after earthly things, God forbids you by the Scriptures to defile your vessels, he forbids you to seeke these things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, he forbids you these courses. Now a man that hath knowledge that is not supernaturall, that hath it not by the spirit, he heares these things with a kind of scorne, and despiseth them as nicities, he never maks scruple of these things, because he knows they are forbidden, or commanded of <hi>God,</hi> because he heares so; but he hath not knowne by the spirit of God that penned the Scriptures, that these indeed are Gods divine truths, the spirit hath not sealed these truths to his soule, this is <hi>Gods</hi> word; he hath not felt it in converting his soule in mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying his corruptions, in raising him being cast down; in working wonders in his consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in bringing all into a spirituall subjection. When he hath not felt the word worke thus,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:17825:139"/>
for all his generall knowledge by education, and breeding, and reading, he may be a diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient wretch, and live, and die a rebell, and bitter opposite against the power of grace: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he hath not knowledge of the word of God and of particular truths by the spirit of God, it is no perswasion of the spirit.</p>
                  <p>And this is that that men wonder at, that know not the mystery of these things: to see great Schollers, men of great knowledge, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps Divines, that are Preachers to others, to see such an one vicious, to see him carnally dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed as others, when a man seeth this hee thinkes, what doe you talke of the word of <hi>God,</hi> if there were such a thing, men that know these things must needs lead their lives after the rule. It is no wonder, the devill hath know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge enough, but he is no divine at all, because he hath it from his nature being a spirit: so a man may be a devill incarnate, he may have knowledge of these things, and yet no true divine. But hee that is taught by the spirit of God, the things in the word of God, the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit workes a taste in them. Historicall truths are knowne by their owne light, there is no such need of the spirit to discover them, but the promises, and threatnings, and such things, are knowne by the spirit, a man feeles the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the word of God, then a man is convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; otherwise if the spirit doe not reveale these things, a man will never obey, but be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="245" facs="tcp:17825:139"/>
And as there willbe no obedience, so there will be no holding out in time of perill and <note place="margin">2 No holding out</note> temptation. The perswasion that a carnall man hath that is not a sanctified perswasion, it will not hold out in the houre of death, in the time of temptation, in strong temptation, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the right hand by preferments, and favours, or on the left hand by threatnings, and persecutions; it is but a seeming perswasion, when any thing comes that is stronger than it, it will not hold; when there is afflictions, and persecutions in the Church, we see many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent learned men hold not out in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, Why? they were drawne to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Religion by dependance on such kind of men, or they only followed religion as they saw reason for it, or they have been so bred in it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now reason may bee brought against reason; when men have no other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives then these, when persecution comes that they must loose their preferments or their friends or their life, they fall away altogether: because that perswasion that they seemed to have before, it was no spirituall perswasion wrought from intrinsecall grounds of divine truth, that hath a majesty, and a spiritualnesse in it selfe, but it was meerely wrought out of forraine grounds. Now we see a meaner man that hath his knowledge wrought by the spirit of God; the same spirit seales that knowledge to him with the word of God, that indited the Scripture, and acted the holy men of <hi>God,</hi>
                     <pb n="246" facs="tcp:17825:140"/>
that wrote the Scriptures. As his portion is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably great, so he is perswaded of his interest in those good things, the same spirit that convinceth him of the truth, and of the certainty of the things, it convinceth him like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise of his part in them, and this supernaturall perswasion together with his interest in those good things perswaded of, sets downe the soule, so as it will not move: he holds out in persecution, because he hath felt the worke of divine truth in his soule; he hath found the spirit of God casting him downe, and raysing him up to comfort, therefore he holds out in his perswasion in all tryalls, and never apostati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth from that estate, and condition.</p>
                  <p>And so for unfruitfulnesse in conversation, <note place="margin">3 No fruitfulnes.</note> notwithstanding all those motives we have in the word of God, a man that is not convinced spiritually of those excellent things, he goes on deadly as if there were no motives, because the spirit of God hath not sealed them to his spirit: hee hath not given him an apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the divine incouragements wrapped up in the promises in the Scripture, and when death and danger come, for the most part such men are desperate notwithstanding all their learning, and knowledge literall that they have. For it will not hold water, all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that is not wrought by the spirit of <hi>God</hi> sealing divine truth to the soule, with some evidence of the power of it, it will not hold out in the tryall. all.</p>

Especially when Satan with his fiery darts comes with strong temptations: for the soule never felt the working power of the word. It feeles then the temptation, it apprehends the poysonfull fiery temptation but it hath not so inwardly digested the truths of the spirit, and therefore is surprized with the horrour and spaire: there is not wrought in heart an de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experimentall feeling of knowledge, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the heart cannot beat backe the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
                  <p>When the Devill shall come and tell men you have beene thus, and thus, and they have not felt the truth of that they seemed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; conscience tels them, it is true I have heard, and read such, and such things, I never believed them, they never sunke deepely into my heart: when temptation shall bee nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer the soule then, the truth shall bee, when temptation presseth sore, they are swallowed up of despaire: therefore let us labour that our generall knowledge from the word and our particular knowledge and perswasion that it may be spirituall.</p>

                  <p>And thereupon comes imbracing (which I shall have occasion to speake of afterward) The soule being perswaded imbraceth.</p>
                  <p>Now this perswasion is not only by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding of arguments by the word, and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, but likewise a working upon the will, from whence there followes an inclination of the will, and an imbracing of the things wee are perswaded of.</p>
                  <p>For let all the arguments in the world bee
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:17825:141"/>
brought to a man to perswade him, that God will be mercifull to him in Christ: tell him of the free offer, <hi>Whosoever will, let him come in,</hi> all that will; a large offer, let him joyne to that offer of mercie the inviting, <hi>Come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laden,</hi> and I will ease you: a sweete inviting: Ioyne with the invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a command; <hi>it is his command that wee should believe in his son Iesus:</hi> let him strengthen that command with the threatning, <hi>he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves not is damned already.</hi> Let a man remove all objections that the soule can make, of its unworthines, <hi>Come unto me all ye that are weary, and heavie laden,</hi> and I will ease you, though you groane under the burden of your sinne. Let a man object againe, I have nothing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy in my selfe. Why, come, and buy though you have no money. Let him strengthen all these proposalls with examples of the mercy of God to <hi>Manasses,</hi> to <hi>Peter,</hi> to <hi>Paul</hi> a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutor, to <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> and the like, let all these arguments be wondrous effectually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, the soule will not yeeld unlesse <hi>Gods</hi> spirit joyne with these arguments, (and all in that kind) and convince the soule of our parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular interest in these things, and perswade the will to imbrace these things offered.</p>
                  <p>That, God hath reserved in his own power, to bring our hearts, and the promises together: to bring our hearts, and divine truths toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Let there be never so much set before us in the ministery, he hath reserved this prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:17825:142"/>
and authority that our hearts, and the truth should close together to imbrace them in hearing. All things depend upon the spirit; when we doe not regard the spirit, in hearing and reading, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Let all the things the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath be propounded, and set on with all the excellency, and eloquence that may be, GOD hath reserved it to himselfe, by his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to give faith to perswade our soules that these belong to us, and to incline, and draw the will.</p>
                  <p>I have shewed you then, the kinds of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion, generall, and particular; and how it is wrought by the spirit, that unlesse this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion be wrought by the spirit, we shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hold out in it, though we have all the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments in the world, we shall be disobedient. Disobedience comes when things are not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by the spirit; and apostacie when the perswasion is not wrought by the spirit: and desperation, when the knowledge is not spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall.</p>
                  <p>Now the manner is by removeing contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries, <note place="margin">The manner of working this perswasion.</note> and moving the heart, and drawing it.

in the affections accordingly to imbrace, then the soule is in a right temper, a man is a holy, and happy man, therefore no wonder if up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on perswasion, and sight, they imbraced those things.</p>

                  <p>Let us therefore labour more and more to have our affections wrought upon. As wee are in our affections, we are in religion.

                  <p>And when he is in such a state, what is all the world to him? What cares he for riches, or pleasures, or honours, when the soule sees incomparable better things? <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee? and what doe I desire on earth in comparison of thee?</hi> saith <hi>David.</hi> When hee had a little meditated of the vanity of earthly things, and saw the goodnesse of God to his children. <hi>It is good for mee to draw neere unto God.</hi> It is a speech of conviction: the soule is convinced that it is good, and best to draw neare to God in holy meanes, and in holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to keep close to him, and then it cries out, <hi>whom have I in heaven but thee?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore let us never rest in such a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of holy things, as doth not convince us
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:17825:150"/>
of the goodnesse of them, and of our interest in them so farre as may draw, and worke upon our affections to imbrace those things.</p>
                  <p>When we finde our hearts, and affections wrought on, that holy things, as they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in themselves, so they have an answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable place in our hearts; that as they are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and high, and best, so they have a high place in our hearts, then a man is in the estate of a Christian: or else a man may very well doubt of his estate, when he can heare of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and happinesse, and of the excellency of the children of God, that they are heires of heaven, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and his heart bee not affected with these things: he may well question him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: doe I believe these things? here are rich and precious promises, but where is my precious faith to close with, and to imbrace these things? doe I believe them? If Idoe, how is it that I am no more affected with them? and so let us stand in the meditation of the excellencies of Religion so long till our hearts be affected and warmed with them. This will follow affections, a desire to thinke oft of them: as <hi>David</hi> joynes both together. <hi>Oh! how doe I love thy law, it is my meditation continually.</hi> That that a man loves, hee oft thinks of, that stirres up love, and love makes him oft consider of it: and when it is thus with a man, hee is in such <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Therefore I say we may know whether we have this spirituall light; whether wee have true faith or no, if we have these imbracings; if wee be so perswaded of them that wee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace them, with delight, and desire, and love, and joy: if we make choyse of them, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme them highly, and cleave constantly to that which is revealed to us; then it is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine light, and perswasion; because wee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace them.</p>

In what measure we apprehend the goodnesse of a thing, in that measure our love is to it: In what measure wee apprehend the greatnesse, and fitnesse of a thing in that measure our affections are carried to it.

Those that do not imbrace, and cleave in their will, and affections to good things, let them say what they will, they doe not believe.

They doe not professe that they call them in question: yet they live as if they made no doubt that they are all false.

                  <p>If these things were digested, they would make us out of love with our owne naturall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, and to labour for a spirit of faith to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade our soules: both that those things are so indeed that God hath revealed, and to get assured perswasion of our part, and interest in them.

                  <p>Let us shame our selves therefore: Lord, <note place="margin">To shame our selves in want of affections.</note> doe I professe I see things above nature? that I see Christ in heaven, and see my selfe there? and do I professe that I am perswaded that the word of God is true, and am I no more affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? where is my love? where is my joy? where is my comfort? doth my heart runne after other things, that professe my selfe to bee perswaded of better things?

and affections: for they are made for these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, our precious faith is made to imbrace precious promises, and to carry the whole soule to them.</p>
                  <p>And let us helpe this with complaining of <note place="margin">To pray for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</note> our selves, and with prayer. Lord, thou hast discovered excellent things in thy word, and hast perswaded me, Lord open my heart, the heart is thy throne: the heart, and will and affections thou dealest with especially: Lord incline my heart, inlarge my heart. The LORD hath promised in the new covenant to teach our bowels to love: Lord teach my heart to love thee. Thou hast opened my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding to conceive holy things; or else I had never beene able to understand thee, and thy truth: teach my bowels also to love, teach them to cleave to the things: take off my love, my joy, and delight, from earthly things and plant them where they should be, inlarge them the right way: fill my heart with thy selfe, as thou hast made it for thy selfe.

                  <p>The soule imbraceth these things in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of faith, and hope in the first place: for faith is an emptiegrace in it selfe, it is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried <note place="margin">

And joy, and delight, with thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, and humility, considering the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the things, and our unworthinesse, that we cannot but have this disposition alway; thankfulnes, and humility. And likewise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment to end our dayes: a disposition that followes imbracing in faith, for where im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing of faith and love is in an imperfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estate, there will be joy when that comes that makes way to full imbracing, that is, in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it selfe: as <hi>Simeon</hi> rejoyced when hee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced Christ in his armes; what did the old

What did <hi>Abraham</hi> then when he came to heaven? when he see all ended there? I say death, that makes way to full enjoyning, and imbracing, in this very respect, it is not only patiently entertained of Gods children, but comfortably, as letting them in to the good things that they esteeme above all the world besides: to the possession of Christ, to heaven, and happinesse. Let us consider of these things.</p>
                  <p>To come to direct us a little, about this imbracing, in faith, and hope, and love, and joy, and the whole soule, when the soule (as it were) goes out to the things wee are perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of. <note place="margin">Quest.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>How shall this be wrought upon the soule?</p>
                  <p>This imbracing wee see it followes upon <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> How this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing is wrought.</note> perswasion; and perswasion followes seeing: <hi>they saw them farre off, and were perswaded of them, and thereupon they imbraced them.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us labour for a cleare understanding of divine things. That which the eye sees, the heart grieves for in ill; and that that the eye <note place="margin">1. By superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</note> sees the heart imbraceth in good. And in what measure our eye sight of heavenly things is clearer, and our perswasion stronger, in that measure our imbracing is lovely, and full of joy and delight. Therefore let us labour to
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:17825:154"/>
grow in knowledge, in supernaturall spirituall knowledge; and that our perswasion may be stronger every day more and more, for answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to that, our affections will grow, and will be carried to the things discovered.</p>
                  <p>And there is nothing more effectuall to commend knowledge to us then this, that it is a meanes to work, a holy and heavenly dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, and temper in us, especially if it be spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall. And let us meditate upon what wee seeme to know and are perswaded of; let us dwell upon things still, to work them upon the will and affections, let us dwell upon them till our hearts bee warmed well with the things knowne; and that we professe our selves to be perswaded of.</p>
                  <p>And joyne with it an enquiry upon the soule; are these things so? doe I know these things? and am I perswaded of these things that they are so? how is my disposition an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable then, am I so affected as I should be? is my love so hote? and my joy so working, and spiritly, and quicke as it should, or no? and hereupon take occasion to stirre up our selves, and to checke our owne soules. Alas that I should have such things discovered, and that I should see such things, in such a strong perswasion in the booke of God, and professe my selfe to be perswaded of these things and yet be so dead at all times.</p>
                  <p>And if we find our affections any thing work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that wee are disposed to imbrace these
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:17825:155"/>
things then wee cannot but be in an excellent temper and blesse God that vouchsafed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the excellency of the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, to shew us our portion by his holy spirit, to enlighten our understandings, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade us, let us blesse God for this, for it is a worke above nature.</p>
                  <p>And withall, because the soule cannot close <note place="margin">To let goe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things.</note> with, and imbrace these things; but it must let loose other things: (for you know, in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing there must bee a letting goe of those things that were formerly within the gripe) if we would gripe these things in our affection and will, we must have them only, we must not think to graspe the world, and them together; the things here below, and them together; as wee shall see after in that point, <hi>they accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themselves strangers</hi> to earthly things. Therefore this is one way to come to this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing, to come to the sight of the vanity, and insufficiency of all things in comparison of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the happinesse wee have by <hi>Christ.</hi> To see in matter of judgment, the insufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of workes, and merit, and such like in the matter of justification; the insufficiency of all such trash as the popish religion abuseth the world withall. And so in matter of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation, to see the insufficiency, and emp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and vanity, yea the vexation of all things besides these good things here offered, the good things that Gods spirit offers to the eye of our soules that he offers to our wills and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections;
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:17825:155"/>
what are all, to these; and effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thinke so, thinke what should draw a mans affections after it; beauty or strength; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what will become of these ere long.</p>
                  <p>And then withall consider the excellency of the estate of the body, and soule in heaven, if we carry our selves as wee should doe, and preserve our selves in our spirituall condition; let us lay these things together, and then wee shall see how infinitely the one is beyond the other. If it be for honour, and favour of the world; consider the vanity of them, and how short a time wee may enjoy them; and the things themselves are subject to alteration. And withall consider the constant excellency of the favour of GOD in Christ Iesus which will comfort us in life, in death, and for ever. And so for riches, and possessions in this world consider how soone all here must be left, and how the soule is larger then all these things, if wee had a thousand times more abundance then we have, and that our soules that are more large, and more excellent, they are not made for these things, but for better; and what use we shal have of better things when these faile, the soule being immortall, and eternall. This will make us let goe earthly things in our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and hold them in their place, in a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary place, as things serviceable in the way to heaven, and not to graspe them in our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, for then they pierce the soule to death and damnation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="278" facs="tcp:17825:156"/>
And if we would be affected as we should be to good things, let us keepe our affections <note place="margin">Keepe the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections tender</note> tender, and keepe them cleare from the guilt of any sinne, that may work feares, and doubts: for together with sin goes feares, and doubts, they are bred in sinne naturally: therefore if we would maintaine this imbracing, oh, let us keepe our soules, as we keepe our understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings cleare, so keepe our affections tender by all meanes, and keepe our consciences unspot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; that so our affections of joy, and delight, and love, may bee ready prest to good things, even to the best things.</p>
                  <p>Another way is in particular to meditate <note place="margin">To meditate of Gods love in Christ.</note> of the love of Christ, the love of GOD in <hi>Christ,</hi> and of his imbracing of us. For wee must know that our imbracing is upon perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Gods imbracing of us. We imbrace not the promises of <hi>Christ</hi> as a man imbraceth a dead post that cannot returne imbraces to him againe: this imbracing of <hi>Christ,</hi> and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, it is a mutuall imbracing, and it is a second, reflexive imbracing; wee imbrace God, and <hi>Christ,</hi> because we find <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Christ</hi> imbracing our soules first in the armes of his love, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we imbrace him again in the armes of our affections, because we find <hi>Christ</hi> imbracing us in the armes of his affections.</p>
                  <p>Therefore let us attend upon the meanes, upon private reading of the word, and upon the ministry: for what are the ministers but to contract <hi>Christ</hi> and the soule together? they
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:17825:156"/>
are <hi>friends of the Bridegroome,</hi> to discove<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> CHRISTS love to us, and his lovelinesse; his lovelinesse in himselfe, his riches in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and his love to us to allure us againe to CHRIST? the ministery is for this end espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, to draw <hi>Christ,</hi> and the foule together. And what is the Scripture in the intent and scope of it, but to discover to us the excellen ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the good things we have by him, his love &amp; good intention to our soules? Now hearing these things in the ministery, they are effectuall together with the spirit to draw our affections backe againe to him. And naturally wee cannot but love those that love us. Now when we are perswaded of Gods love tous in <hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>Christs</hi> love to us (God having made our soules for love to himselfe, and friendship with himselfe, and the nearest, and sweetest conjugall friendship, now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) the more his love is discovered to us, the more we shall love him.</p>
                  <p>Therefore let us be constant in attending up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on good meanes; we shall alway heare some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, that will either strengthen our faith in the promises of God, or shew us our duty to God againe; we shall have something disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered whereby the spirit will bee effectuall to help this imbracing. Let us go to reading and hearing with this scope, and intention: Now I come to heare, I come to have my soule wrought on; I come to heare some message from heaven, to heare some good thing to
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:17825:157"/>
draw my minde from the world and worldly things; and upon hearing our duty to God, to walke lowly in thankefulnesse for those good things that wee have, and that wee hope for in another world? It is no wonder that men lose their affections that are carelesse in the use of me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>nes; and if they loose them, will they not loose all? The best man living if he be care lesse in using the meanes of salvation, and give himselfe to the world altogether, or to his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, things not in themselves unlawfull, his affections will be dead, he shal loose them: for God hath ordained that our affections should be quickned by heavenly meanes, and GOD knoweth better than wee our selves that hath sanctified these meanes to this purpose. In at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending upon the meanes, we shall heare a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of good things, and heare comforts, and have our light strengthened by new disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of new Scripture, or by old Scriptures lively applyed, something to increase the life of our perswasion at every Sermon, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding good bookes, and by every good compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and that which increaseth knowledge, and perswasion makes our affection, and imbracing stronger.</p>
                  <p>I beseech you let us take these courses, or else all is to no purpose: the maine thing in religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is the will and affections: and when the wil and affections are wrought on, the worke is done in the matter of grace. And there is no other way to know whether the former wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

of the understanding, and perswasion bee ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall and to purpose or no but this; to know whether the will choose, and cleave to good things; and whether our affections joy, and delight in them: there is the tryall of the maine worke. The worke indeed is especially in the judgment, when it heares soundly and supernaturally of the ills that are to bee avoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and of the good things that are to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced: bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Now that which is immediate to our soules is our affection of joy, and delight, and the the like. Therefore let us take to heart these things, and never think we are any thing in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion till our hearts and affections be wrought upon; till our knowledge be such as may sway that whole inward man.</p>
                  <p>Againe consider the excellency of these <note place="margin">The excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the good we hope for.</note> good things that we have discovered to us in the Gospell, (that are the object of our imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing) together with the necessity of them, that without them we are wretched creatures, there is no hope for us. Let us every day consider what ground of hope wee have, (though the things be not yet possest) whether the things be true that we hope for; whether they bee confirmed to be true or no; and how we rest on them: for let things be never so excellent, and necessary, unlesse the soule conceive of them as things attainable, as things belonging
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:17825:158"/>
to us, all is to no purpose, this effect of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing will not bee wrought in the soule.

they should have, by meditating on these things, of their excellency, and necessitie, and to conceive in Scripture the grounds of hope of them, it will quicken us.</p>
                  <p>Adde likewise (for our owne interest) what worke of the spirit we have; and then what singular promises we have, that where GOD hath begun he will make an end. For why is the worke of the spirit called an earnest, but that <hi>God</hi> will make good the bargaine? Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what worke of the spirit we have: for whatsoever is spirituall is eternall in a man: what joy is spirituall, what love is spirituall, what knowledge is spirituall, it shall be made up in perfection, it shall never be taken away.</p>
                  <p>See then how the spirit seales us by the worke of it; and what earnest wee have, in peace of conscience, and the work of it. This will cherrish hope: for that is part of this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing, to imbrace them with faith and hope.</p>
                  <p>And this should be a daily course, to work upon the affections, to estrange them from all things and from the meditation of all things else. And as I said before to consider the love of <hi>God</hi> to us, and to love him again. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider likewise the hopefulnesse of good things, that nothing in the world is so made good to us as the things of a better life, the things of grace, and glory. And God hath borrowed from all assurance amongst men, terms to shew the assurance of the good things we have in hope and faith. The pledge of the spirit; the
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:17825:159"/>
earnest of the spirit; the seale of the spirit: the witnesse of the spirit. What termes are there used among men that may confirme any thing, that you have not used to strengthen this supernaturall assurance of these supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall good things? GOD herein succours our weakenesse, knowing how prone we are to call these things into question. And consider especially our owne unworthinesse, our vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and basenesse, that we deserve none of this: when conscience is once awaked to know aright our owne unworthinesse, then we shall find it a difficult thing to believe these things. Therefore it is a worke worthy our daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, to search the Scriptures, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes it selfe to our capacity, and confers al the help in the world to increase our grounds of hope of the best things; and then our disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is as it should be.</p>
                  <p>And let us deepely consider of the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of heavenly things, and the foulenesse of sinne, and the danger of our naturall condition, and this will make us imbrace better things, He that sees himselfe in danger of drowning, will imbrace that that may stay him. He that sees himselfe in danger to be pulled away from that that upholds him from sinking, he will claspe about it fast. Let us consider what a many things we have in this world to pull us away from God and good things, and to loose our gripe, that wee may not lay such hold of them. The devill envies our imbracing of

these things, and there are many things to loose our affections from them, consider the danger, and withall the necessitie of these good things: that if they be lost, we doe not only loose them, but we loose them with the losse of our soules with eternall damnation in the world to come: we do not simply lose them, but we plunge our selves into the contrary. Let us consider of this, and it will make us claspe fast, and keepe our hold by all meanes possible. In that measure that we apprehend the danger, in that measure we shall imbrace these excellent things. <note place="margin">Case.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now to answer a doubt, and a case or two by the way: How happens it then that Gods children sometime, when their judgment is convinced; yet their affections are not so quick, they are somthing flat in their affections. As Gods people complaine sometimes: alas that I should believe such a happinesse as hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is; and such glory; and yet find my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections no more stirred! Is it possible that I should be the child of God, and believe these things, and find my selfe no more affected? <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> Why the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Gods children are somtimes dead.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Indeed this troubles the peace of <hi>Gods</hi> chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren sometimes, and good reason: for we see here, after sight comes perswasion, then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing; the will, and affections, cannot but entertaine that good they are perswaded of; and so there is great ground for the objection.</p>
                  <p>But there may be some mistake in this, for sometimes the judgment may be convinced,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:17825:160"/>
and yet the affections not bee so quick: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there may bee a diversion at the same time: there may perhaps bee some present crosse, that may be fall thee, or some present thing lawfully loved, that takes up the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at that time. As for example, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of Father, Mother, Wife, or children, or of other friends may take up the affections for the time; now the affections running that way at that time, perhaps not sinfully neither: they are not so inlarged to heavenly things, God knowes our capacity, and what our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions can doe.</p>
                  <p>Then againe there may bee some present griefe upon them, that God to humble a man may take up his affections, so that at that time he shall not be so affected with good things: though ordinarily he comfort himselfe with the best things; and so he doth afterward, when he hath given his griefe, and his present affections some libertie. There is a love of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, &amp; of valuing: a man may be deceived that way. A man values his child more than a stranger that he entertaines: yet for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent he may give a stranger better lookes, and better entertainment. Though he set mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> value on his child, or his deare friend that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> hath secured himselfe of; yet hee will not shew such countenance to them as to a stranger on the sudden.</p>
                  <p>So it is here, Gods children, their constant joy is in the best things, and they are judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:17825:160"/>
carryed to the best things; but on the sudden there may be an entertaining of some other thing, and perhaps not unlawful neither; perhaps it may be sinfull; to humble Gods children: but that is but but on the sudden: his course is to carry his affections above all earthly things.</p>
                  <p>Againe in another case Gods children are deceived this way sometimes, for they think they have no affections when they have affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. How is that seene? in case of oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; let God, and Christ, and heavenly things be opposed, and you shall see then that they have affections. Those that for want of stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the grace of God in them; or for want of good meanes or by indisposition of body seemed to be dull in their affections; let reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion be disgraced, or opposed any way, and you shall finde then their affections deepe in their hearts to heavenly things: but they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared not before, because there was no oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition. These, and such like thoughts we may have to content the soule that is disquieted this way. But the rule is certaine, that a mans af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections are as his perswasion is, and his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion as his light is: As he hath a heavenly light, discovering heavenly things, so is his perswasion of a better estate then the world can yeeld; and answerable to his perswasion, his soule is raysed up to delight in the best things. This is his course; if it fall out to be otherwise, there be reasons for it, which we
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:17825:161"/>
must discreetly judge of, and not trouble the peace of a good conscience. To goe on.

Itsets downe how they apprehended themselves to be, and how they discovered themselves to the world to be.</p>
                  <p>They were in regard of heaven indeed, heirs of happinesse, heirs of a kingdome, in regard of the world, and earthly things, they were strangers, and pilgrims. And as they were, so they made themselves, to be no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than they were, <hi>they confessed it,</hi> they were not ashamed of it: they apprehended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to bee as they were, and they carried themselves answerable: their life and course spake as much as their tongues, they confessed both in word, and in deed, that they were <hi>strangers, and pilgrims.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now in the words I say, you have their disposition, and their profession; their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, <note place="margin">Scope of the words.</note> and their confession. Their disposition, and carriage, and state, and condition, <hi>they were strangers and pilgrims.</hi>

                     <pb n="289" facs="tcp:17825:161"/>
The discovery of it, they confessed they were so. And this confession is double.</p>
                  <p>Their confession was either verball, as <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> confessed, when he came before Pharaoh, <hi>few and evill have the dayes of the life of my pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage beene,</hi> saith old <hi>Iacob.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Or it was a reall confession, discovered by their carriage, that they were strangers: their course spake louder then their words.</p>
                  <p>Those that in the whole course of their life, shew a weaned affection to earthly things, though they talke not gloriously, as some idle persons doe in a bravery, we are but strangers here, and we must be gone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Though I say they doe not speake thus as some doe that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thinke so: yet notwithstanding their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage bewrayes it: their course, and company, and conversation shewes that indeed they <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse themselves pilgrims, and strangers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the order of the words is this: <hi>stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,</hi>

                  <p>And <hi>Pilgrims,</hi> shewes our carriage to our country, our going home: a pilgrim or trave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler is he that is going homeward. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed themselves that they were not at home; but they were going toward that that was their home, toward heaven, to that Citty <hi>whose builder and maker was God himselfe.</hi> Wee are <hi>strangers,</hi> to shew what we are here on earth;

                  <p>The points considerable are; first this, <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>s Gods children upon earth here, are strangers, and pilgrims. They are not at home but are travelling toward their country.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second is this, that</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They prosesse themselves to be so:</hi> They know they are so, and they confesse that they are so, they are not ashamed of it.</p>
                  <p>For the first,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is the disposition of him that hath truly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est</hi>

                     <hi>in better things</hi> (though but in faith, and hope) <hi>to bee a stranger, and a pilgrim in regard of all things here below.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this followes the other: for where the eyes of the understanding, are opened, and a man is perswaded, there is an imbracing of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things, as our proper good things; there is a considering of all other things as things that doe not belong to us, in a manner we are stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. When faith apprehends Christ, and heaven, and happinesse to be our own, and our country to be above: faith apprehending and grasping these things and imbracing them: at the same time, it is to be supposed, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily followes; that we are strangers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="291" facs="tcp:17825:162"/>
It followes out of the necessity of the thing it selfe: for upon the very consideration that a man is an heire of heaven, that he hath ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther country, and condition, out of the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie of the thing it selfe, though there were no other reason for it, the affections of the soule will be closed up (as it were) to other things; and he will consider of other things, in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour condition as they are.</p>
                  <p>For the things, though they bee good in their kind and order, both the things above, and the things below, yet there being such a difference in these good things; and the things here below, the contentments here on earth, being so meanely good, and so short in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, and so weake in their satisfaction of the soule, that they cannot bee possessed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the blessed assurance of better things, but with the affections of strangers, and pilgrims: this followes I say from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing, that in whose eyes heavenly things are great, in his eyes earthly things are meane. They are accounted as they are, secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary meane things of the way, to help him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward home.</p>
                  <p>If a man were on the top of a great moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, he would see the things below to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little, and the things above would appeare greater to him, so when the soule is raised up to see great things, though they be a farre off, as these did with the eye of faith; at the same time, his soule looking to things below must
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:17825:163"/>
needs apprehend them to be little in quantity, as indeed they are.</p>
                  <p>If a man were in body lift up to heaven, and should looke upon the earth; what were the earth, but a pooresilly point, the whole earth i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> selfe, much more a mans owne possession: so when the soule is lifted up to heaven by faith, (which sets a man in heaven before his time;) when it looks from thence to the earth, and earthly things, it must of necessity consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them as they are, to bee poore meane things. Therefore this followes, that being perswaded of the promises, that is, of the good things promised in religion, in the word of God: to earthly things, they were strangers, and pilgrims.</p>
                  <p>He that is from home, and hath another home, which he is not at, he is a stranger: but Christians have another home.</p>
                  <p>For first, they are bred from heaven, they are borne from heaven, they are borne in <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Christians borne anew from heaven.</note> that is from above; they are borne in the Church by the seed of the word and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: now as they are from heaven, so their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> is to heaven againe: for every thing naturally riseth as high as it springeth. As we say of water, it mounts as high as the head of it is: so our affections mount as high as the spring of them is. Now a Christian being borne from <note place="margin">Heaven a Christians Country.</note> heaven, he tends to that in his affections, that is his country. It is his country, because his father is there, in his glory; and his Saviour
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:17825:163"/>
is there; and a great part of his kindred are there, the soules of perfect men, and the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Angels in a most glorious manner, (though they be in their attendance upon the earth;) there is his country, his Citie, his house, there is his happinesse, his home. I shall not need therefore to prove that the godly are strangers. If heaven be his country, earth must needs be the place of his pilgrimage: there is no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion but that followes.</p>
                  <p>It is said here, <hi>they were pilgrims, and stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers upon earth. Vpon earth.</hi> Because where e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a Christian is, if it be upon any place upon earth, he is a stranger and a pilgrim; if he be in his owne house, he is upon earth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is a stranger in his owne house; if he be in his owne possession, he is upon earth, and therefore he is a stranger in his own possession. As <hi>David</hi> confessed though he were a King, <hi>I am a stranger, and a pilgrim here as all my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 15. A King in his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome <note place="margin">1 Chron. 29. 15.</note> is upon Gods earth, and therefore he is a stranger in his own kingdome here. As <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">August.</note> saith very well, <hi>quisque domus suae, &amp;c.</hi> every man is a stranger in his owne house, wee are strangers here on earth; therefore. It is not any condition on earth that exempts a child of God from being a stranger, when the greatest Kings in the world have confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims: so that all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, of what condition Ioever they are, from the highest to the meanest, they are all stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:17825:164"/>
upon earth, it is a cleare point.</p>
                  <p>And it must needs be so, for the head of <note place="margin">Christ a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger on earth.</note> Christians was a stranger: his love made him a stranger: for he left his fathers bosome, his love drew him from heaven to earth, and here, he conversed as a stranger: he dwelt in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy here as a tabernacle which he layd aside for a while, to work the worke of out redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and then after to dwell in it for ever. He was the prime stranger of all strangers, he that makes us all strangers here and Citizens of heaven, he was a stranger on earth. He was not indeed a stranger: for hee was Lord of heaven, and earth: yet in regard of his state of exaltation that was to come after; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of dispensation, he was here as a servant: he lived here as a stranger. And indeed he was as strangely used; <hi>for hee came among his owne, and his owne knew him not,</hi> as it is in <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. he was not knowne among his owne Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie <note place="margin">Iohn 1.</note> men the <hi>Iewes:</hi> hee was a stranger on earth.</p>
                  <p>He conversed with us here, and was among us as a stranger: you see how his speech and carriage and conversation on earth, it was as a strangers. He was talking alway of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers house, and of the kingdome of heaven. When he speakes of the estate of the Church, which is the only company of people here, in whom God rules by his spirit; yet because they are ordained for the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; he calls them strangers here, and termes
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:17825:164"/>
them by that that they are ordained to. All his minde was of the kingdome of heaven: we see after he was risen, the matter of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, as the Gospell tells, it was of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven, he talked of things that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the kingdom of God: all his spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches were that way, and his comparisons were fetched that way. <hi>The kingdome of heaven</hi> is like to such a thing, and such a thing. And all his worke was to draw men from the earth. As it was his grand work to redeem men from the earth; that is, from hell, and from their cursed condition: so the matter of his teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was answerable to his work, to draw men to heaven, all the paines that he tooke before, and after his death till he was taken into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it tended that way.</p>
                  <p>He came from heaven to earth to wooe us to be a spouse to himselfe, he came from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven into a strange countrie, to take us for his spouse, to take our nature, and in our nature, to winne us to die for us: he carried himselfe as a stranger every way, he regarded not earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things. Now answerable to our head <hi>Christ</hi> must all Christians bee in their affections and dispositions, we must be conformable to him; we must be strangers as he was.</p>
                  <p>All that looke to die in the faith of <hi>Christ,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">We must have affection of strangers.</note> and to be happy for ever, they must witnesse their believing, and loving of better things by an answerable carriage to all things here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, they must have the affection of stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:17825:165"/>
and travailers: Faith doth enforce this. It is the nature of the soule from a principle and ground of nature, that when the soule is carried up one way, it is shut another: when it cleaves unto, and imbraceth better things, when it is open to heaven, the point of the soule is shut to the earth, and wee looke upon these things as strangers and pilgrims, only for necessary use.</p>
                  <p>These, holy men the Patriarchs were stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. <note place="margin">The Patriarchs strangers.</note>
                  </p>

                     <note place="margin">Psal. 39. 12.</note> So all the Patriarchs they professed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be strangers, and sojourners; and they did it not in word only but in deed: they shewed it by dwelling in tabernacles, and tents, poore things, fit for strangers; heaven was their house, Tabernacles are moveable, weak things that have no foundation: So they knew their life was like a tabernacle here. And their manner of life shewed what they looked for, they carried themselves as those that hoped, and looked for better things. They were strangers in their dispositions, they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected things above, and cared no more for these things then for necessary use, to helpe them to serve God in their places; and those that are strangers in their dispositions they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to be at home.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="297" facs="tcp:17825:165"/>
Againe they were strangers in GODS e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme. God termed them so; and so it is with <note place="margin">2. In Gods esteeme.</note> all that believe in Christ: when we once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and are new creatures, new borne to a better inheritance, presently at the same time we are strangers here.</p>
                  <p>Strangers likewise in the esteeme of the <note place="margin">3. In the worlds esteeme.</note> world. The world used them as strangers, strangely. When a man leaveth the world and cleaveth to God; presently the world setteth on him by reproaches, and all they can; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they think he will disgrace them by his change; therefore they labour to make him, as black as they may that way: they use all strangely that breake from them. God will have it so: because he will have his children not to love the world, therefore he will have the world hate them. So they are strangers in that respect, they think it strange that they doe not as they did formerly; that they doe not as they doe, wicked men thinke it strange that they <hi>runne not with them into the same ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of ryot:</hi> so, they are strangers in the esteem of wicked men.</p>
                  <p>So they are strangers in regard of their place, heaven is their hope: they are <hi>begotten to an inheritance, immortall, undefiled, &amp;c.</hi> they live in a place where they are strangers, they are every way strangers.</p>
                  <p>But you will say, wicked men are strangers, <note place="margin">Object.</note> and pilgrims too? <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Wicked men how strangers here.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>I answer, they are indeed so: for in regard
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:17825:166"/>
of the shortnesse of their lives, and the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie of the things they injoy: for they out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live all their happines here, they are snatched hence before they bee aware, therefore they are but travellers here; but they goe from ill to worse: yet in regard of their affections they are no strangers, but account themselves at home from a spirit of infidelity, and pride, and earthlinesse. Therefore they are called men of the earth, and those that dwell on the earth, in the Revelation: because they looke no furtherthen the earth, and here they roote, and fix their affections upon this earth: they do not fix their hearts and affections upon the things above, they looke not after them, they care not for them, they value them not nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme them. Therefore, answerable to their thoughts, and bent of their soule and mind, is their discourse, their speech and carriage: and thereupon they are called <hi>men of the earth, and called the world,</hi> because they love nothing but the world; they are as it were changed into the things they love, they are earth, as the Prophet saith, <hi>Oh earth, earth, &amp;c.</hi> and they are the world, because their affection of love joynes them to these earthly things. The Church in the Revelation is called <hi>heaven:</hi> but the beast is said, <hi>to rise out of the earth:</hi> for that which bred the carnall religion of Popery it was nothing but earth, and earthly respects. Therefore how ever they are strangers here, that they cannot be here long, and they have
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:17825:166"/>
soules that are of an everlasting continuance: yet because their affections, and the bent of their soules are all here, they account them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves at home here, and here they plant them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and their posterity, therefore though in some sence they be strangers, yet not in that sence that the children of God are.</p>
                  <p>Every Christian is borne from above, and borne to things above, and hee is a stranger here. All his course from his new birth till he come to the possession of his inheritance in heaven, it is nothing but a travailing, he never sits down, but is alway in his motion, and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage. Every good work is a step of his way: he is in motion still; he takes degrees from better to better, from grace to grace, from knowledge to knowledge, till he come to his home.</p>
                  <p>Let us make a tryall of our selves, how our affections stand to these things; whether our hearts bee weaned from earthly things, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly if we have imbraced <hi>Christ,</hi> we shall use the world as though wee used it not. We shall be transformed into the Image of <hi>Christ,</hi> and he used the things of this world as a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, only to comfort him in the way; we shall have the same mind that he had. We shall car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie our selves as strangers, as those that hope for a country in heaven.

                        </gap> seeke great things for thy selfe?</hi> If a Christian did consider, Iam going to heaven, to <hi>God,</hi> what do I seeking great things here, which God will destroy? What will become of heaven and earth, and all things here ere long? And if the time be long ere heaven and earth be destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet what will become of me ere long? I shall be turned to earth, and shall I seeke great things here upon earth? Shall I not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with my portion? certainely a stranger is content with his present portion, he that is a traveller, when he comes to his Inne, if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps things be not so cleane, if his usage bee not so good; he thinkes it is but a night and away; it is no great matter, this is not the maine; he will not be over much discontent, and quarrell at any unkind usage in the way, for he knowes he shall have better usage when he comes home. Therefore as he will bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with little, be it what it will be, he knows it is not the maine.</p>

<pb n="301" facs="tcp:17825:167"/>
the way, and so hinder himselfe in his journey. he will be patient in the injuries, and wrongs in this life. If a Prince be mis-used in another country, he is contented, and thinkes with himselfe, I have a country where I shall be more respected; and therefore he beares it the more willingly. So a Christian is a King, he is an heire, and being a stranger, he shall meete with dogges in this world; as, who doe dogs bark at, but at strangers? now being strangers we must looke for dogged usage. It is no wonder that dogs barke at strangers, it is their kind: they consider it is the disposition of wicked men to doe so, they doe but their kind. Would a man have dogs not to barke? and would we have wicked men that have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill tongues not to scorne that they know not? to doe otherwise is to forget their kinde. A Christian knowes they doe but their kind, he pitties them, and he doth not stop his journey and his course for it. He will not be scorned out of his religion by a company of prophane spirits, hee will not be laughed out of his course; he knowes what he doth better than they, they are madde, and fooles, he knowes it; and they shall know it themselves ere long. He knowes that he is in a serious judicious course that he can approve, and they cannot theirs, therefore he will not be scorned out of his course.</p>
                  <p>Thus faith in <hi>Christ</hi> makes him that is a stranger here, content, and patient. He whose
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:17825:168"/>
soule hath imbraced <hi>Christ</hi> is contented with any thing: any thing is sufficient to his soule, that is filled with better things. Nothing will content a covetous earthly man; a man of the earth: such men think themselves at home, they make a league with hell, and death; the men of the world they thinke they shall live here alway: but a Christian, that imbraceth a better life with <hi>Christ</hi> in happinesse to come, he knowes he shall not be here long, hee is here but as a stranger, and shall shortly bee at home, and therefore he is contented with any thing.</p>
                  <p>Likewise the knowledge of this that we are strangers and pilgrims, it will make a man not <note place="margin">4. Thankefull.</note> only content and patient, but thankfull, for any kindnesse he finds in this world; that God sweetens his absence from heaven, and his pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage on earth what; that God should love me so, not only to give me heaven; but to give me contentments on the earth to swee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten my way to heaven, what a mercy is this! He is thankfull for any contentment, hee is thankfull to the world, to those that doe any thing for him, that afford him any courtesie here that may helpe him in his pilgrimage, and make it lesse troublesome and cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some to him.</p>
                  <p>All the Saints in former time were won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous thankfull for that they had: for what can a travailer look for but discourtesies, and hard usage? and if he find any thing better he

will be thankfull: certainely it is more then I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ad enough, they began to maligne him, why? his face was toward <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> So when base worldlings see that a man will to heaven, and leave their company, and courses, they cannot digest this. A man of an ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science when hee sees another oppose that course that he resolved to sticke to, he sees he confutes his course, he sees his face is toward heaven, and therfore labours to disgrace him. As the wench said to <hi>Peter, Thou speakest as one of Galile, thy speech bewrayes thee.</hi> So when a man is going toward heaven, every base per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, the veriest rascall of all, hath pride en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough to scorne Religion: So wee see they make not much of the world, nor the world of them, therfore they are contented, and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full if they find better: for what can a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger looke for but strange usage in a strange place.</p>
                  <p>And therefore we see in Scripture, how thankfull they were, even for refreshings, for meate and drinke: our Saviour <hi>Christ</hi> was knowne by breaking of bread; he used to be thankfull. <hi>In all things give thanks.</hi> They saw the favour and love of GOD, in a crum of bread, and in a drop of refreshing in any kind: oh! here is a blessed God, that hath given us

I observe this note of some weake Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans that thinke they are not heavenly minded, except they doe nothing but think of heaven, and heavenly things: that is but a weake and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>lly conceit. It should be our thought in the morning, our thoughts should open with that, it should be the key to open the morning, the thought of this course what will become of us ere long in heaven: but then all that we doe should be in vertue and strength of that prime intention to please God, and to go to heaven: though we think not alway of the present bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse: yet it is good as much as may bee to quicken our indeavour.</p>
                  <p>And hence it is that there is another pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie <note place="margin">7. Though he step out of his way, he comes in againe.</note> of a stranger that is going to a place, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he may step out of the way, yet not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing by vertue of his first intention he ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers himselfe home-ward againe, if he take other matters in hand, he gathers home still: though he go out of his way, in he comes; he considers, this is not my way. So a child of God, sometimes he diverts, and turnes aside, yet notwithstanding he considers, doth this way lead to God ward? to heaven ward? be these actions Christian actions? are they the way to heaven? if he see they be not, though he have stepped awrie, he comes in again, and is gathering homeward. Though he may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps forget himselfe a little, (a traveller) yet his bent is homewards. So a Christian man though perhaps in some particular he may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:17825:170"/>
himselfe, yet he is alway gathering home, his bent is home, and his course is godly. Take a Christian, perhaps he may step awrie, but his course is godly, and hee labours to recover himselfe: and if a traveller stay at any time by the way, he makes amends afterwards by making more hast. So doth a Christian, if we consider him with his affections loose to good things: yet he recovers himselfe againe, and sets upon religious actions and courses with more violence of spirit, and recovers his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer losse againe.</p>
                  <p>A traveller and stranger he provides before <note place="margin">8. He provides for all incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances.</note> hand for all incumbrances; he knows though he meete not with troubles, yet he may, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he will be sure to goe with weapons, and he will goe with that that may sustaine him by the way. Religion teacheth a man to gather out of the word of GOD, comforts before hand, and munition before hand to carry with him: put the case he never use them; he may have cause to use them, and then if he have them no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>, what will become of him? he lies open to adversaries by the way. Therefore there is a spirit in a Christian, an instinct, that stirres him up, he will be reading the word of God, and good books, and hearing the word: this I may have use of at such a time, this I will lay up for such an occasion: put the case that such an occasion come not, hee looseth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, he seasoneth his soule, in the mean time, and prepares it for worse things if worse come
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:17825:170"/>
Woe to those that have not layd up strength and comfort against evill times before hand. If a man goe to s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>a, and be not provided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand, if he take a journey, and be not provided before hand, then when a storme comes, what a case is he in? It pleaseth God to teach us by these resemblances, heavenly things: therefore because they are fit means to convay holier things unto us, it is good to take this help that God affords us, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that he shewes us by these shaddowes, better things. When we travaile, and are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on in our journey towards heaven, it is good to consider higher things, it is a good meditation: therefore to goe on a little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>A traveller, and stranger is inquisitive of <note place="margin">9. Inquires of the way.</note> the way, whether he be in the way, or out of the way; he askes not at randome, that doth not content him, whether hee goe West, or North, or South, or East, it doth not content him to aske where lies my country, Eastward, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> No; but hee will aske the particular townes, and particular turnings and windings how he may avoyd going out of his way, and which is the right way; and he will aske upon every occasion, because he knowes, if he goe but a little out of his way, it will bee a long time ere he shall recover it, and he will be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to come backe againe, and the more he goes out of the way, the more trouble it is to come backe againe. So it is with a Christian,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:17825:171"/>
he doth not only desire to know in generall, but he desires to have daily direction, what shall I doe in such a case of conscience, and in such a case? how shall I overcome such a temptation if I meete with it? And so he is willing to have daily direction how to walke with God day by day, that he goe not out of his way in any thing.</p>
                  <p>For even as every step that a man takes is a part of his journey; so every action of a mans life it is a part of his journey to heaven; and therefore he is willing to have direction for every step, that he may walke step upon step, upon good ground: therefore he goes upon good grounds of a good conscience, in the duties of Christianity, he wil have sound con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, what is good, and what is true in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: what religion is true that he may ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture his soule upon; and what use he may make of his particular calling; what hee may doe with a safe conscience, and what not; and what he may not doe that he will not meddle with, and what is cleare to his conscience that he will doe. So every step he takes, though it be in his particular calling, it helpes him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: As Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, in the Epistle to the <hi>Colossians,</hi> of servants, that they serve God in serving their master; so a poore servant in his drudgery may serve God. So in our ordinary professions we are in the way to heaven, if they be sanctified by prayer before hand, and do it in conscience and obedience to <hi>God,</hi> that hath set us in this way.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="309" facs="tcp:17825:171"/>
There are two callings, our generall, and particular calling, and we shew religion, that is our generall calling, in our particular calling, as wee are placed in this or that calling, and what we doe in either of these callings, is the way to heaven. Now the care of a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an is, that he be well advised what to doe, and on what ground.</p>
                  <p>And even as a traveller considers of things <note place="margin">10. He useth things as they may help in his journey.</note> by the way as they make to his end, to further his journey or hinder his journey, he looks to heaven as his country that he hopes for, and therfore he doth not tangle himselfe with any more than may help him home; if they hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him once, away they go, if they may help him he takes them. A Christian in his travaile in the way to heaven, considers of things that may fall out by the way, as they may help and further him to heaven. If I find that things, <note place="margin">Indifferent things.</note> though they be indifferent in themselves, if they trouble me in my way to heaven (it may be they are not so to another, but they are to me) though another can do it, yet I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider whether I can do it, and find my selfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged to heaven as at other times? if not, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with it, it is not indifferent to me, because it hinders my journey to heaven. A wise tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller will venture upon things, and courses as they serve, or hinder the maine, though they bee things perhaps that hee cannot over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well spare, yet if they trouble him in his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, off they go, that he may be more expedi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>e and right in his way.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="310" facs="tcp:17825:172"/>
I wonder at the boldnes of many that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse themselves religious, and yet dare ven ture upon any thing. Vndoubtedly if they did search their owne hearts, they could not but say that such courses doe dead and dull them, and make them forget religion, that such company is not safe to keepe, I find my selfe the worse by it, why should I venture upon any thing, that may stop, and hinder, or coole, and dead me in my way to heaven? If a man be wise, he will consider of things as they help or hinder him to that.</p>
                  <p>As for sinnes whereof we are convicted, it is the Apostles counsell, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. he puts it <note place="margin">Apparent sins.</note> out of all question, <hi>we must cast off all that bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den that presseth downe, &amp;c.</hi> A traveller will not have a burden upon him. The sin that hangs so fast on, we must labour to mortifie, to kill our lusts and corruptions more and more, and never leave till wee have cast them off, these things are undenyable. I spake before of things in themselves indifferent, and to other men in different, if they have a larger measure of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; but for corruptions, and sins, they fight against the soule; they fasten us to the world: therefore above all things wee must cast off them. As Saint <hi>Peter</hi> saith excellently, in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. <hi>I beseech you brethren, as pilgrims, and</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">I Peter 2.</note> 
                     <hi>strangers, abstaine from fleshly lusts, which fight against your soules.</hi> Insinuating that pilgrims, and strangers should altogether abstaine from lusts, from the cherishing of carnall lusts, for
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:17825:172"/>
these fight against the soule, they fight against the comforts of the soule; against the graces of the soule, and against the eternall well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the soule. The more a man cherrisheth base lusts, the more it damps his comfor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Yet with a secret concealing of it, not to entangle the consciences of other men, who perhaps may use those things with lesse hinderance then we doe. A wise Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian will be warie in that kind: If he find the things of the world to hinder him, he will not have his heart eaten up with the world, nor eaten out with lawful things: being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to prepare for a better life and to do <hi>Gods</hi> busines, he will only take the things of this life as they may make for a better life, and be a furtherance of him to his home; he winds home by all meanes, he useth all advantages to come nearer to God, and whatsoever hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders him he labours to avoyd.</p>

Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians are Kings and heires, they esteeme not or disesteeme of themselves by what they have here below, they account them as things in the way, that God gives them, if they bee good, to sweeten their pilgrimage; if they be ill to sharpen their journey. It is necessary that God should give them these things, good things to sweeten their journey, and if they loyter in their way to heaven, then that they should have crosses to drive them homeward.</p>
                  <p>In all confusions in the world, faith teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a man to stand as a man upon a rocke im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable, because he is a stranger: if any thing fall out in the Citie or place where a stranger is, he carries his owne Iewels, and things about him and so goes away, his goods are not of that place: so in all confusions of the world a Christian hath good things of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother world; the good things he carries with him, are not subject to losses or crosses; they are not subject to the misusing of the world:
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:17825:173"/>
when all things shall bee on fire, a Christian hath his treasure laid up in heaven, in a place where no earthly creature hath power of it; it is not subject to any ill; and that make; him in all estates contented and patient. Let hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth goe together, a Christian when hee hath imbraced better things, a Christian thinks himselfe a stranger that is going home, therefore in all his life he carries himselfe as a stranger. To goe on a little further.</p>
                  <p>A travailer in his way, must of necessitie have refreshings by the way, or else he will faile: therefore sometimes he sings, and som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Let us therefore when wee grow weary, refresh our selves in walking, in holy meditation, take a turne there, to thinke of the vanity of all earthly things, and how soone they come to an end; and of the excellency, and eternity, of our glorious condition, and estate when we come home; and then think of the helps and comforts by the way, and such like. The Art of divine meditation is an Art for this end, that since wee are all travailers, that wee are from home, and that we are going home, we may walke in wisdome. Let us learne that art
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:17825:174"/>
to feed and strengthen our soules with such meditations as may cleare them by the way: to set some time apart when we grow dull, and indisposed in religion; then let us think how to cherrish and refresh our soules with those excellencies that are indeed above our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension, our hearts cannot conceive of it; it is set out in the word of God to our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite, but as it is wee cannot conceive here what is reserved for us when wee shall come home: therefore let us doe as travellers, often thinke of home, and what is at home for us, and that will make us when we are in the way, and any comfort would draw us out of our way, to think. O these are good comforts, but this is not my home, I have betterat home then this, and this will stay mee from home. Therfore the crosse is necessary for travailers, that they may know they are not at home, that they may imbitter his comforts. This consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, that he is not at home, and that this is not his country, as it will keepe a Christian from temptations, so it will draw him on to constancy in his love, and in going on: for a travailer sits not downe, to stay there; hee thinkes, here I am, and home I must goe, and I shall not come home by sitting here.</p>
                  <p>So the oft thinking of home, it will both sweeten our troubles, and likewise the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts that wee meete with in this world, it will make us that wee shall not bee ens<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But he that is assured of a country, and knowes that he hath a better home then all these earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, that are shaddowes and vanity; he thinkes these are very goodly things, but what are these to that that is reserved? and if I sit downe by these, if a travailer sit down by delights, and gaze upon things by the way, when shall he come home? Let us think oft of home, there are many uses to thinke and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate of that blessed day, this among the rest: that it drawes us on forward, and forward still, that we shall not sit quiet but goe on still, and not rest till we come home.</p>
                  <p>And the nearer we are home the more busie, and the more chearefull wee should bee: as a traveller, when he comes neare home hee is more chearefull, when hee hath home in his eye: when he sees the smoake of his country he rejoyceth. As these Patriarchs, they saw the promises a farre off. As men when they see the toppes of steeples and houses; they thinke, now wee have them continually in our eye, we see some thing of home, and the nearer they come the more they see, and the nearer they come, still the more they see: so the longer a Christian lives, the nearer and nearer he comes home: if he understand him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:17825:175"/>
and have any assurance in any degree, it makes him more joyfull towards his end.</p>
                  <p>Thus it was with Gods people, when they were nearer their end, then they sung sweetly the Swannes song, and then they were inlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in their spirits: as <hi>Iacob</hi> when he was dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we see what a will he made, what legacies to his children. And <hi>Ioseph</hi> when he was dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and <hi>Moses</hi> the man of God. The song of <hi>Moses,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> the <hi>sweete singer of Israel.</hi> The last words of <hi>David</hi> what sweete words they were. And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> when he was to go out of the world, <hi>I have fought the good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith, henceforth is laid up for me the crowne of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, &amp;c.</hi> And our blessed Saviour toward his end, wee see how heavenly he was in his prayer. And good <hi>Simeon, Lord now let thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant depart in peace, &amp;c.</hi> when he had grasped <hi>Christ</hi> once, he was loath to live any longer: so it should be with Christians as it is with travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, the nearer they are home the more and more comfortable they should be still.</p>
                  <p>It is a shame for old men to feare when they come neare their end, when they are neare the haven then to feare. It is as if a man in a storme should feare the haven; or a man that trav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> and sees a Citie to be afraid of his own house; whereas hee should rejoyce and thinke hee is nearer his happinesse then other men, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tels the Romans, <hi>your salvation is nearer now then when you first believed.</hi> So we should
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:17825:175" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thinke our salvation, and happinesse in heaven is nearer now then when we first believed; and therfore the lesse time we have to travaile here with incumbrances in the way to heaven the more joyfull we should be. The nearer wee are to death, the nearer to our preferment, the nearer to our country and our home. These are the advised thoughts of a Christian: and when other thoughts come into a man, when he is stricken in yeares, surely they are not in him as a Christian, but as he is weak, and wants faith, and assurance of salvation. Oh, let us therefore labour to get assurance of another a better country: for what made these holy men confesse themselves strangers, and pilgrims here? <hi>They saw the promises a farre off and were perswaded of them, and imbraced them,</hi> and in that measure they were assured of a better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, <hi>they carryed themselves as strangers and pilgrims here.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To wind up all in a word, you see here their disposition. I beseech you make this text your patterne, to be molded into: you see how these blessed men long agoe lived in faith when their light was lesse then ours is, and they died in faith, and will welcome us when we shall come to heaven, we shall goe to <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> and the rest of the Patriarchs and holy men. It will bee a blessed time when all the blessed men that have gone before shall wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come us to heaven. If we looke to be happy as they are, we must live as they did, and die
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:17825:176"/>
as they did: though we cannot so strongly as they did, see that with the eye of faith that no eye else can see: yet let us desire God to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade us of these truths more strongly, then the devill of our own lusts shall perswade us to the contrary: let us desire God to set on his truths so strongly that all other things may not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us, that we may imbrace them with our best affections, of love, of desire, of content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that we may witnesse all this by our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour to earthly things, by our base esteem of them, and carry our selves as pilgrims and strangers on earth. If we do thus live in faith and die in faith, we shal live with <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> in the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven eternally.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE dependance of these words <note place="margin">Dependance of the words.</note> (in a word) is this. The Apostle after he had laid the grounds of some Doctrines, hee doth frame the building of a holy life and conversation. It is in vaine to believe well, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse a man worke accordingly: hee that lives against his faith shall be damned, as he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves against it. Thereupon in this Chapter hee comes to raise their affections to be Heavenly minded, and stirres them up to subdue what so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is contrary to Heavenly mindednesse. And
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:17825:178"/>
because it is a duty of great moment to be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly minded, and to subdue base affections, he inserts weighty reasons betweene: If yee bee risen with <hi>Christ,</hi> seeke those things that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove. And among other reasons, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Now how shall we doe both? <hi>For yee are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You see the first proposition, <hi>yee are dead,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">A Christian dead, how.</note> with whom? <hi>with Christ in God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A Christian is dead many wayes. He is dead to the law, to the morall law, he lookes not to have comfort and salvation by it: by the law, he is dead to the law, and so flyes to Christ.</p>
                  <p>A Christian is dead also to the ceremon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ll law: now in the glorious lustre of the Gospell, what have we to doe with those <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> element that were for Children? A ceremo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition is opposite to the glory and lustre of the Gospell, as the Apostle speakes in the former Chapter.</p>
                  <p>He is dead likewise to sinne, having commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Christ (when he dyed for sinne) hee is dead to sinne. He that hath communion in the death of Christ, hath the same affection to sinne that Christ had. Christ hated it infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:17825:178"/>
when he suffered for it; so every Christian thinkes that Christ dyed for my sinnes, and by union with Christ, he hath the same affection to it, he is dead to it.</p>
                  <p>And because this is but an inchoation, and beginning, a Christian is not perfectly dead to sinne, hee stands in need of afflictions, and in regard of afflictions he is dead, they must help the worke of mortification. And because no affliction can sufficiently worke mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but death it self, which is the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of mortification, we are dead in respect of death it selfe, which is the accomplishment of all: though we live here for a time, we are dead in regard of the sentence that is passed on us, as wee say a man is dead when the sentence is pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed on him; in that respect wee are dead men, for our life is but a dead life (besides the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that is passed upon us) death siezeth upon us in the time of our life, in sicknesses &amp;c. And so they prepare us to death: thus, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wayes we are dead.</p>
                  <p>The second proposition is,
<q>Our Life is hid with Christ in God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>We are dead, and yet we have a life. A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian is a strange person, hee is both dead and alive; he is miserable and glorious, he consists of contraries; he is dead in regard of corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and miseries, and such like, but he is alive in regard of his better part, and he growes two wayes at on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>: it is a strange thing that a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian doth, hee growes downewards and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:17825:179"/>
at the same time; for as he dyes in sin and misery, and naturall death approaching; so he lives the life of grace, and growes more and more till he end in Glory.</p>
                  <p>This life is said to be a hidden life,
<q>It is hid with Christ in God. <note place="margin">Life of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian hidden.</note>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The life of a Christian, which is his glorious spirituall life, it is hid among other respects.</p>
                  <p>It is hid to the world, to worldly men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause a Christian is an unknown man to them: because they know not the Father that begets, therefore they know not them that are begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, as S. <hi>Iohn</hi> saith: they know not the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Christian: he is raysed into a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ranck then they. Therefore as a beast knowes not the things of a man, no more doth a carnal man, in any excellency, know the things of the spirit, for they are spiritually discerned; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is a <hi>hidden life</hi> in the eyes of the world: a wordly man sees not this life, in regard of the excellency, he passeth scornes, and contempts of it, of folly and the like. A Christian, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of his happy life, is a stranger here, and therefore hee is willing to passe through the world, and to be used as a stranger.</p>
                  <p>It is a hidden life likewise ofttimes, not only to worldlings, but in regard of the children of God themselves: because by reason of some infirmities that are in the best of Gods children, they are apt to judge amisse, harshly and rashly one of another. Likewise by reason
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:17825:179"/>
of those calamities that are common to all men alike, they are afflicted as others, and have sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, and are contemned more then others, and by reason of this, the children of God often censure those that have the beginnings of spirituall life in them. It is hid from them.</p>
                  <p>It is hid likewise from themselves: for often Gods children know not themselves, in tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in their nonage, in the beginning of their conversion, in the time of desertion, and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall slumber and sleepe, Grace seemes to bee dead in them, and then they know not that they have this spirituall life, especially if this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion bee joyned with outward abasement, they call their estate into question, as in <hi>Psal.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Psal 73. 7.</note> 73. 7. and in diverse places of Scripture: Gods children oftimes, by reason of their inquisition and search, they raise clouds, whereby they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale from their owne eyes, their owne life. Partly through distemper of body, and partly by distemper of spirit, there are clouds raysed betweene them and their happinesse, that they cannot see their spirituall life.</p>
                  <p>But especially it is hid in regard of common infirmities, wanting gifts that others have, that have not a dramme of grace sometimes, that live to please men, and looke altogether to the outside, they doe that many times to pleasemen better then a Christian.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes God himselfe hides himselfe out of wisedome and mercy to us, when he sees that we carry not our selves so reverently as we

should. And this reason may bee sufficient of Gods dispensation: God will have it so: part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the further hardning of wicked persons, and for tryall: for if all were laid open in this excellent estate of a Christian, who should try their patience? who would not be a Christian for the comfort, and for the sence, and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling? Oh, but this is not so, a Christian hath a life, but <hi>it is a hidden life:</hi> therefore God will try whether men will live by faith or sence, whether they will have their wayes now or no, or whether they will depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that glorious life that God will reveale in time to come, and to exercise and streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then faith: God will have it so, that this life shall bee now hid, that we may live by the promises, though wee have no feeling at all; that we may perswade our selves in the greatest desertions and extremities, yet I <hi>have a hidden Life in Christ,</hi> though I have little influence, and manifestation of it in mee: yet I have a glorious life in my head, and I live now by Faith, till I come to live by sight. This is one reason.</p>
                  <p>Wee should not therefore take offence, wee must not judge of Christians by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward shew and appearance, as CHRIST saith, wee should not judge of our selves by outward appearance, nor of the Church. The Whore of Babylon hath more painting and setting out, in all glorious shewes (it being an outside religion) then the true spouse of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:17825:182"/>
Christ, whose glory and beauty is within, doth it follow therefore that shee is the true Church? Oh no, for the beauty of the wife of Christ it is a hidden beauty, shee is glorious within, a stranger doth not meddle with the joy of the Church. Christians have a name indeed, and <hi>a stone, that none know but them that have it:</hi> It is hidden <hi>Mannah,</hi> we must not judge of the Church, or of Christians by outward appearance, wee shall bee deceived in that. Our Life is hid with Christ, the spring of all spirituall life. The Life of a Christian is a secret life, it is a peculiar life, it is a safe life. It is secret because it is hid; as I said, Gods children are secret ones, they are not knowne to the world, nor to themselves oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times.</p>
                  <p>But ordinarily faith in them breakes through the Cloud, and unmaskes God himselfe, and sees Gods Fatherly face, though hee hide himselfe. They have a promise to lay hold upon, and they acknowledge him to be their Father, and wrastle with him, it is a secret Life, but it is not so secret, but that Faith ses into it, it pierceth the Vayle, and sees a glorious Life there. Faith will see <hi>Gods</hi> glorious countenance; Faith makes it a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Life though it bee secret, therefore let us not judge our selves nor others by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance.</p>
                  <p>And it is also a sure life, <hi>it is hid with Christ</hi> in <hi>God,</hi> marke on what grounds it is sure.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:17825:183"/>
First it is hid in Heaven, no enemy can come there, the Divell comes not there since he first lost it, and was cast out. It is safe in regard of the place, it is hidde in Heaven.</p>
                  <p>And it is safe, because it is hid in Christ, who purchased it with his blood, who hath trampled upon all opposite powers, over death, and hell it selfe, it is hid in heaven, and in him who hath overcome all opposite power, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is a safe life.</p>
                  <p>And it is hid with Christ in God. Christ is in the bosome of God; Christ mediator, it is hid with Christ in God, hee is the store-house of this life, it is hid with him. If any can rob God, then they may rob our Life from us, for it is hid with Christ in God; it is a sure life therefore. Oh! but we may lose it, though it bee sure in respect of God. <note place="margin">Object.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>It is likewise a peculiar life, only to Gods people: for they only have union, and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Christ, and therefore he saith here, <hi>your life is hid with</hi> Christ <hi>in God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is likewise a glorious life: for it is hid with Christ, who is the glory of God, and he

saith in the next Verse, <hi>when Christ who is our life shall appeare, we shall appeare with him in Glory.</hi> It is a glorious life, but of that I shall speake in the next verse.</p>

Alas, we are ready to judge of our selves by the present, and not to thinke it a glorious life: but hee saith, it is hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den for us; <hi>Light is sowne for the righteous,</hi> it doth not appeare for the present. A garden hath seeds sowne, and hearbs, but in the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter there is no difference betweene it and a common field; but when the sunne shines and appeares, then the hearbs appeare in their lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stre: so it is with a Christian, there is light, and immortality, and happinesse sowne for him, when Christ, <hi>the Sonne of Righteousnesse, shall appeare, then we shall appeare with him in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As wee may say of all things below, they have a hidden life, the plants and the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the winter, they live by the roote, and when the Sunne appeares, then they also appeare with the Sunne in glory. So it is with the Righteous, they have a hidden life, it is hid now in the roote, in their head, in this life, when Christ the Sonne of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse shall appeare, when the spring comes, when the resurrection comes, then we shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare with him in glory; and so I come to speak of that verse.
<q>

When Christ, who is our life shall appeare, then shall yee appeare also with him in Glory.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our life is now hid, our happinesse is vayled over, there are many things betweene us and our life, but shall it alwayes bee so? Oh no, <hi>When Christ who is our Life shall appeare, wee shalt appeare also with him in Glory:</hi> hee meets with a secret objection. The parts here to be stood on are these.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>Christ hee is our Life,</hi> hee shall appeare in Glory as our Life. This is taken for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it is a supposed truth, <hi>When Christ who is our Life shall appeare,</hi> it is taken for granted that he shall appeare in glory:</p>
                  <p>The next thing is, that wee shall appeare likewise with Christ. Christ shall appeare, and wee.</p>
                  <p>And then the consequence, how these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend one upon another, because Christ appears in Glory, therefore we, <hi>when Christ who is our life shall appeare.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Apostle cannot mention Christ, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an addition of comfort, and the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an soule loves Christ, it sees such matter of comfort, and such righteousnesse in him, that it cannot thinke of Christ, without a comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table addition of Lord, Saviour, Life, Hope, Glory, &amp;c. Christ carryes with him all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, hee is food, the bread of life, the water of life, all that is good to the soule, therefore
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:17825:184"/>
the Apostle gives this sweet addition, Christ out life. 
<q>How is Christ our life.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He is every way the cause of the Life of Grace and of Glory. And not only so, the cause, but the roote, and spring in whom it is: wee have it from Christ, and in Christ: wee have it in Christ, as a root, and from Christ as a working cause, and by Christ as a Mediator: For Christ procured Life at Gods hands, by his Sactifice, and Death. Wee have it in Christ as a head, from him as a cause (together with both the other persons) and through him as Mediator, who by his death made way to life; appeasing the wrath of God: so we are reconciled and pardoned by the death of Christ.</p>
                  <p>Christ is not only our Life so, but as the matter of our life that wee seed on; when hee hath wrought spirituall life in us, then the Soule lives by Faith in Christ still, and seedes upon him, hee is our life because wee feed on him: for as food nourisheth the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, so the Soule, being every day set on by fresh temptations, and afflictions, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and fresh discomforts, the Soule of necessity is forced to looke to Christ, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, and to feed upon Christ, to feed upon his blood af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>esh, which runnes conti nually: for hee is a Mediator for ever, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:17825:185"/>
he is in Heaven to make good, that hee hath done by his death and wee looke upon him every day, and feed on him, and so hee main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines the life he hath begun. <hi>Christ</hi> is our life thus:</p>
                  <p>More particularly (for memorie sake) <hi>Christ</hi> when by faith wee have union with him once, (as we can have no communion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out union with him) when wee are one with him once by faith; wee have life from <hi>Christ;</hi> the life of reconciliation in law, opposite to our death in law, and in sentence; for by nature we are all dead, and damned as soone as we are borne for our owne sins, and the sins of our first parents; wee are dead in sentence: Now by <hi>Christ</hi> there is a reversion of this sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. <hi>Christ</hi> by his obedience, and suffering hath satisfied his father: so by our union with <hi>Christ</hi> wee are alive in sentence, we are absol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in GODS court of justice, for hee will not punish sin twice.</p>
                  <p>And then after the life of <hi>justification</hi> being justified by faith, we have the life of <hi>sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and <hi>holinesse:</hi> for GOD out of his love, when he hath pardoned our sin, he gives his spirit as the best fruit of his love: and we having our consciences absolved, and acquitted by the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of GOD through the obedience of <hi>Christ,</hi> wee love GOD. GOD so loveth us when he is appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by <hi>Christ,</hi> that the barre being taken away, our sinnes being pardoned, and the sluce of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy open, there is way made for another life,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:17825:185"/>
the life of sanctification by the spirit: upon pardon of our sinnes he gives the spirit, and we feeling that love, have love wrought in us to him againe, and that love stirs up every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian to obedience.</p>
                  <p>In the next place, after he hath acquitted us by his Alsufficient satisfaction, being God and Man, and hath given us his spirit: there is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other life, the life of comfort, which is the life of our life, in <hi>peace of conscience,</hi> and joy unspeakable, and glorious, this life issues from the former: for when we find our conscience ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peased, that God saith to our soules, hee is <hi>their salvation,</hi> and find a newnesse wrought in our nature by the spirit of God, and some strength to obey him, then we begin to have a sweet peace, (as the Children of God find in themselves) and joy unspeakable, and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
                  <p>This is the life of this life, having union with Christ, and his Righteousnesse, and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, wee have this peace, which is the way to Glory, and the beginning of it. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that, Christ is our life in Glory after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, in this life he is our life. Answerable to our servile feare, as wee are dead in law, we have a life in justification. As wee are dead in nature, so we have a life in sanctification, wee are dead in despaire and runne into ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of Conscience, so wee have a life in joy, and peace.</p>
                  <p>But all those in this life are imperfect,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:17825:186"/>
because there is only an union of Grace here till wee come to the union of Glory in Heaven, and then at the day of judgement there will bee a perfect justifying of us, wee shall not only be acquitted in our conscience, as we are now, but wee shall bee acquitted before Angels and Divels and Men, and Christ will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge us: these are they for whom I dyed, these are they for whom I made intercession in Heaven, we shall be acquitted there, and there wee shall be acknowledged:</p>
                  <p>And then the life of sanctification, that is now in part, shall then be perfect, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the peace that now <hi>passeth understanding,</hi> shall then bee full, and our joy shall bee full by Christ who is our life:</p>
                  <p>So then we see we have in Christ the second <hi>Adam,</hi> whatsover wee lost in the first roote. Whence did we draw sinne, and misery? by union with the first <hi>Adam,</hi> we have damnation, we have the wrath of God, we have corruption opposite to sanctification, we have terrours, and horrour of conscience. By the second <hi>Adam</hi> and union with him we have a spring of life, and peace, and all that we lost in <hi>Adam,</hi> and more then all we lost, he being God-man. The sinne of the first <hi>Adam</hi> was the sinne of a man: the obedience of the second <hi>Adam,</hi> was the obedience of God-man, which raiseth us to life everlasting. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. So that there is more comfort in the life we have by Christ, then there is discomfort in our death by <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:17825:186"/>
We see then hence that in all our deadnesse and dulnesse, and want of grace, there is a spring in our nature. God hath given Christ, God-man, that there should be a treasure in him for all the Church, that we may fetch sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply out of our nature. He is fit to be our life: for our nature in him is united to the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, therefore Christ is a fit fountaine to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive grace to beleevers; because mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in him is advanced, by being united to the second person, he is God-man, able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive all grace, and comfort, and righteousnes whatsoever. Shall the first <hi>Adam</hi> derive unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, discomfort and misery that was a man? &amp; shall not Christ God-man, derive righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, and comfort, and joy, and peace, and whatsoever is good? undoubtedly he shall. Therefore in all want of grace, in all tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and assaults, let us goe to the fountain, to the fulnesse of grace, to the fulnesse of Gods love in Christ, Christ, God-man is our life. As when we are cold, we come to the fire: so when we are dull-hearted, let us come to this quickening spirit.</p>
                  <p>And to this end, let us be stirred up to use those meanes wherein Christ will be effectuall, (whereby as by veines, the blood of this spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall life is conveyed;) as the Word, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, the Communion of Saints, and all sanctified meanes, whereby the life of grace, and comfort may be conveyed to us: let us ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be out of such wayes, and courses, as where
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:17825:187"/>
by Christ derives this life of grace, and let us take heed of those that are contrary.</p>
                  <p>But, how shall I know, saith a weake soule, <note place="margin">Question.</note> (that finds little comfort, and peace, and little sanctification, and is besieged with troubles, and is doubtfull, and knowes not whether his sinnes be forgiven or no, how shall I know) whether Christ be my life or no?</p>
                  <p>I answer that the life of Christ is but now <note place="margin">Answer.</note> begun in us, and it is very little at the first. There is nothing lesse then grace at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. The life of Christ is conveyed to us from Christ voluntarily not by necessity. <hi>Hee gives the will and the deed according to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>;</hi> therefore we must know that we have more or lesse comfort, and more or lesse grace as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth. He brings all to heaven in all ages that have the true life of grace, though he make a difference, and give to some more, and to some lesse, because he is a head that flowes into his members, not out of nature, but of his owne pleasure.</p>
                  <p>And a Christian soule that hath union with Christ, that hath a being, and station in him may know it; there are alway some pulses from this heart: as we know there is some life by the beating of the pulses: so Christs dwelling in the heart, is knowne by these pulses, there will be striving against corruption, and complay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it. (Nature, and corruption will not complaine against corruption: co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ption will not strive against corruption,) there will be
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:17825:187"/>
sighing, and groaning, which is seconded with a constant indeavour to grow better, it is not a flash: these pulses beating in the soule of a true Christian, shew that there is the life of grace in him, that Christs dwells in his heart. And this oft times doth more appeare in the greatest temptations: Take a Christian at the worst, his heart sighs to God, to recover him, he is sick, and yet he hopes in Christ, Christ in the greatest desertion is his life, who was also our paterne, when he was at the lowest, <hi>My God, my God.</hi> So a Christian at the lowest, he hath a spirit of prayer, (though it may be) he cannot pray distinctly, yet he can sigh, and groane, and God heares the sighs of his owne Spirit alwayes: Therefore when these pulses beate in him, in the greatest temptations hee may know that Christ lives in him.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes Christ in respect of this life, in this world reserves himselfe to the chiefe occasion; as some great affliction of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man. In 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. We see there, when the <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.</note> body of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was afflicted, when it was abased by many afflictions, <hi>The life of Christ was most manifested in him.</hi> God reserves to poore Christians (that now live in peace and quiet) the greatest feelings and manifestations of Christs living in them, till some great crosse, till the houre of death, till a time of need. The life of Christ is most manifest in the time of abasement.</p>
                  <p>By the way therefore, let us not avoid cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:17825:188"/>
for <hi>Christs</hi> sake: avoid not any abasement, though it be imprisonment, or death; the more our outward man is abased, if it be for <hi>Christs</hi> sake, the more this life of <hi>Christ,</hi> this blessed life, this peace that <hi>passeth understanding, and this joy in the Holy-ghost</hi> is increased; we shall feele our ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, and justification the more. This life of <hi>Christ</hi> is most manifested when wee honour him most by suffering for him. Therfore let us avoid no crosse for him. 
<q>Christ who is our life, Shall appeare:</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are two appearings (wee know) of <hi>Christ;</hi> his first appearing, and his second appearing. His first appearing was to worke our salvation; his second shall be to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish, and finish what he hath begun to worke. His first appearing, was to redeeme our soules from death, &amp; his second shall redeeme our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies from the corruption of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> so his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond appearing shall be to accomplish all the good that he came to doe and to worke by his first. As verily therefore as <hi>Christ</hi> is come in his first appearing; so verily and certainly he shall appeare the second time. And as it was the description of holy men before his first comming, to wayte for him, <hi>To wayte for the consolation of Is<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>ael:</hi> so Christians now; those blessed soules that have the report of this they waite for the comming of <hi>Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There were all kind of witnesses then of his first comming, <hi>Angels, men, women, shepheards,</hi> the Devils themselves, <hi>The Trinitie</hi> from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:17825:188"/>
witnessed of him: so for his second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming there are witnesses. <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe saith hee will come. The Angels say, <hi>This Iesus that ye see goe up shall come againe.</hi> It is an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of our faith, that he shall <hi>come.</hi> The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God in every Christian saith <hi>come,</hi> and that is not in vaine, the desires of the Spirit of God must be fulfilled, therefore he shall come; and the Spirit of God stirres up our spirits to say <hi>come.</hi> There are all kind of proofes, &amp; argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for it. It is an Article of our faith: it is laid here for a ground, and therefore I will not inlarge my selfe in it: but come to the next point. <hi>Christ</hi> will appeare, and
<q>We shall also appeare with him in glory.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>We shall appeare, and appeare with him and appeare in glory with him. <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe his glory is in some sort hid now: for though he be King of the Church, yet wee see what enemies are in the Church; and Satan ruffles in the Church a great while, and the nearer he is to his end, the more he rageth; so that <hi>Christs</hi> glory seemes to be hid; but <hi>Christ</hi> then shall appeare, and his Church shall appeare with him in glory.</p>
                  <p>Why shall wee appeare with <hi>Christ,</hi> and be glorious with him? <note place="margin">Question.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>I answere, this is cleare: partly because it <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Answer.</hi> Iohn 17.</note> is <hi>Christs</hi> will, in <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. <hi>Father I will that where I am they may be also.</hi> It is <hi>Christs</hi> last Testament that we should be where he is, and be glorious with him, and <hi>Christs</hi> will must be fulfilled.</p>

                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:17825:189"/>
Againe, consider what we are to <hi>Christ,</hi> how neare wee are brought to him, and then this will be cleare, that when <hi>Christ</hi> shall appeare in glory, we must appeare with him: for <hi>Christ</hi> is our Husband, and we are his Spouse, when <hi>Christ</hi> comes to be glorious, therefore his Spouse must be glorious; now is but the time of contract, the time of the marriage, solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity shall be at the appearing of <hi>Christ:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when he shall appeare, we shall appeare with him in glory. <hi>Christ</hi> in his owne person, distinct from his Church, is now glorious as a head, but <hi>Christ</hi> mysticall is not glorious, <hi>Christ</hi> mysticall suffers: there are many members that are not yet called. Some are abased, &amp; some are not brought to the fold: And <hi>Christ</hi> hath a care of his mysticall body, as of his naturall body; and as that is glorious in heaven, so hee will bring all his members to be one glorious bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. He gave his naturall body to redeeme his mysticall body, therefore as he is glorious in that in heaven, so hee will be glorious in his mysticall body, in every beleeving soule at the last, when hee <hi>shall come to be glorified in his Saints,</hi> as the Apostle saith, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1. Hee is <note place="margin">2 Thess. 1. 10.</note> glorious in himselfe now: then he will be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in his Spouse.</p>
                  <p>And then from the ground of predestinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>We are predestinate to be conformed</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>to Christ, that he might be the first borne among ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny brethren.</hi> Now <hi>Christ</hi> being glorious, and we being predestinate before the world was to be
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:17825:189"/>
like unto <hi>Christ;</hi> first in abasement, to be aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed for him that was abased for us, to suffer for him that suffered for us, and to be confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to him in grace; there must be a time to be conformed to him in glory? From the ground of Election, there must be a state of glory, our glory must be revealed when <hi>Christ</hi> shall come and appeare. I will presse no more reasons that we must be glorious at the second comming of <hi>Christ</hi> as well as himselfe.</p>
                  <p>Wherein stands this glory? <note place="margin">Quest.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>To cleare this point a little, I will not be <note place="margin">Answer.</note> long in it; because indeed this glory is such, <hi>as eye hath not seene, nor eare heard, nor hath entred into the heart of man.</hi> The Apostles speake not much of it, they speak of it in negative tearms, by denying imperfections: <hi>It is an inheritance incorruptible, immortall, &amp;c.</hi> And when it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled to earthly things, it is compared to a banket, to a marriage, &amp;c. But this glory, it shall be in body, in soule in the whole man.</p>
                  <p>In soule, there shall be the knowledge of those mysteries of salvation, that now wee are ignorant of. Now wee are in the Grammar schoole, but that shall be as the University. Then we shall know things more clearely, we shall see God face to face; and then our soules shall be raised to be capable of more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and grace. Now the vessell of our soule is not capable to know that that we shall then, they are not capable as they shall be in heaven. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> himselfe was not capable, therefore
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:17825:190"/>
when he was taken up into the third heavens, least he should be proud of his revelations, he was faine to be abased. Wee are not capable, we cannot know the glory of heaven in a full measure now: but then, God shall inlarge the heart, and sanctifie it, that we shall have strong spirits, and holy understandings, and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to understand holy things, we shall know God face to face. There shall be a proportion betweene the glorious things in heaven, and our soule there shall be a heavenly soule for a heavenly place, where as yet it is not so.</p>
                  <p>I forbeare to shew the particulars of the glory of the body: the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> sets it downe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>It shall be a spirituall body:</hi> it <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.</note> shall be guided by the Spirit, and the body, it shall not then need meats and drinks, but God <hi>shall be all in all.</hi> Now, our life at the best is fed and cloathed by the creatures, then, all shall be taken out of God himselfe, God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe shall be <hi>All in all.</hi> The presence of God, and of <hi>Christ</hi> our Saviour shall supply all that we have now other wayes. Now, comfort is conveyed from this creature, and from that; but whatsoever comfort we have now dropped by the creatures, we shall then have all in him, and in fulnesse, and for evermore. So we shall be glorious in soule and body.</p>
                  <p>And in our whole man, the Image of God and <hi>Christ</hi> shall be perfectly restored, we shall be like <hi>Christ,</hi> reserving the difference between the head, and the members, reserving the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:17825:190"/>
of a naturall Sonne, and of sonnes adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; he shall be more glorious then we; we shall be glorious as much as we are capable off, in all fulnesse of joy, and grace, and dominion over the creature, in freedome from ill, and readinesse to good, we shall be glorious sons of God. I need not to be long in unfolding these things.</p>

                  <p>When he shall appeare, saith the Apostle, <note place="margin">Answer.</note> we shall also appeare with him in glory. It is carryed indefinitely to stoppe curiosity, there is no time set downe: but <hi>when</hi> hee shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, &amp;c. In a word, when all the Elect shall be gathered together. It is not meet that our bodies and soules should be glorified, till all Gods people be gathered together. As in a <note place="margin">Simile.</note> family they doe not sit downe till all the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants be come in, and then they sit downe together: so in this great family of God; the Saints in heaven and earth, there shall not be perfect glory, till all be gathered, and saved. And then what a blessed time will that be, when every one shall be glorious himselfe, and shall put downe the Sunne in glory in his body, and soule? and when there shall be such a world of them so glorious.</p>
                  <p>If every Starre be beautifull, how beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull are all in their lustre? when so many Saints shall be gathered together they shall be farre more glorious then the Sunne in his Majestie; and this glory is reserved till
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:17825:191"/>
all be gathered together. God said of the creatures severally they were good, but when hee looked on them together, they were exceeding good: so the severall soules of Christians are glorious: but at the day of Judgement when all shall be gathered together, there shall be an exceeding glory. It is reserved I say for the gathering together of the Saints: when <hi>Christ,</hi> who is the head shall have gathered all by his word, and ministery out of this sinfull world (which are scattered here and there) then they shall come to perfect glory. Then there shall be perfect union betweene the body and soule; then there shall be a perfect union betweene us, and all that are dead together; then there shall be a perfect union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene us, and <hi>Christ,</hi> then we shall have the perfect fruition of God, of Angels, of all the blessed company in heaven. Oh! what a blessed time will this be? and this shall be at the glorious appearing of <hi>Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Christ</hi> shall appeare in glory himselfe, as verily as he appeared in his first com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and wee shall appeare with him in glory.</p>
                  <p>Why should wee doubt of it? is not that which is greater done already? hath not God himselfe become man? hath not God dyed? and God beene abased in his first comming? Is not that more wonder, then that man should become like God in
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:17825:191"/>
his second comming? whether is greater for God to become man, or for men to be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed out of their graves, and become glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious? certainely this is the lesser, why should we doubt of it? Let us rayse our hearts with this, that as verily as he came in abasement to worke our salvation, so verily hee shall come, and rayse us to glory, and this is a lesser worke then the former.</p>
                  <p>But to come nearer, to make some further use of this, surely these are maine points, and should bee oft thought on. O! that the hearts of Christians were exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised with them. Could wee be dead ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for grace or comfort, if wee did oft thinke of this with application? Let us oft warme our selves with these things: let us bring our selves to the light, let us thinke of the blessed times to come: could we be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfull? This made Saint <hi>Paul</hi> adjure <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi> and the <hi>Thessalonians, I beseech you by the comming of our Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> &amp;c. I shall need no greater argument to presse you, then as verily as <hi>Christ</hi> shall come in glory, and as you shall be <hi>gathered to him:</hi> so heare what I say. So Saint <hi>Paul</hi> chargeth <hi>Timothy,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 13. <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>I charge thee before Christ, who at his comming, &amp;c. Keepe this Commandement.</hi> This will moove a mans conscience, and carry him to duty, if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else will. Let us thinke seriously <hi>Christ</hi> will come with thousands of his <hi>Angels in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and majestie,</hi> and all shall be glory then,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:17825:192"/>
there shall be nothing but glory; glorious in his company, glorious in himselfe, glorious in his enemies, he shall trample them under his feet, by a glorious confusion, there shall be nothing but glory in heaven and earth then. And wee shall come to the same glory; the Spouse shall partake of the glory of her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. Let us thinke of this, it will quicken, and inspire all our courses with a spirituall kind of light to all actions, it will enliven, and quicken them.</p>
                  <p>And it will put a kind of manner upon all our actions, that they shall be acceptable to God. For how should wee performe all that comes from us? All should be done in since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and constantly, and abundantly, &amp; cheare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, readily, and willingly, for God requires these qualifications in what wee doe; now what stirres us up to do all in this manner, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptably to God, but this consideration?</p>
                  <p>What stirres us up to doe things sincerely to Christ? He will appeare in glory, therefore let us doe things that may stand with his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It is no matter what the reprobates of the world judge, let us doe things so as wee may stand before Christ at that day. A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian studies to arraigne himselfe before Christ, that he may doe that that may approve him to him that shall be his judge ere long.</p>
                  <p>And so let us hold out, we shall receive a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, what will make us constant but this? what makes a man sowe his seed, that he scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:17825:192"/>
can spare, but the hope of a harvest? what makes a man runne, but the victory, and the Crowne? so what makes a man worke, but the hope of reward? be <hi>constant, for in him yee shall receive the reward if yee faint not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And so for abounding in good workes, <hi>your labour is not in vaine in the Lord:</hi> what made Saint <hi>Paul</hi> presse the abounding in good workes? <hi>Finally my brethren, be sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast and unmooveable, al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>y abounding in the work of the Lord, why? for your labour is not in vayne in the Lord:</hi> your bodies shall rise againe ere long in glory, when <hi>Christ</hi> shall appeare you shall appeare, and be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious with him. <hi>Therefore abound in the worke of the Lord; sow to the Spirit,</hi> and you shall reape glory; <hi>they that sow sparingly shall reape sparing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> What mkes men abound in workes of mercy and love, but this appearing of <hi>Christ?</hi> If their love be perfect, they have comfort in this appearing, and if they abound in mercy, <hi>Christ</hi> will appeare in mercy to them.</p>
                  <p>And so for chearefulnesse: that God also requires in every action, what inlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the heart of a man in Gods worke? what puts fire into his affections but this, that <hi>Christ</hi> will come and appeare in glory ere long? that he will come, and crowne every good worke, that we shall not loose a good word that hath beene spoken in a good cause, not the least good action, not a cup of

                        </gap> in his Saints.</hi> This makes us doe things sincerely, constantly, abundantly, and chearefully.</p>
                  <p>I beseech you consider from what ground these things come: for these are principles that should be grounds of faith: they are pregnant, and spred themselves through the whole course of a Christians life, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are worthy to be thought often on.</p>
                  <p>Againe, why doth God reveale these things before hands, that wee shall appeare in glory in our body and soule, in our whole man? As it shewes us our duty, and the manner ofit, so it is a ground of comfort in all estates; A Christian may thinke: Now my life is a hidden, secret life. I passe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der censures, it is thus in the world, and thus with me; well there will a time come, the time of Resurrection that will make amends for all; for this sickenesse of body, and disquiet of mind, and all an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyance, <note place="margin">2</note> and adversity; and it is revealed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand for our comfort that there shall be such a time that wee may make use of it, that we may ground our patience upon it. When Saint <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts to patience, saith hee, <hi>The Lord is at hand,</hi> and Saint <hi>Iames</hi> saith, <hi>The Iudge standeth at the doore.</hi> Let us be patient in infamies, and sufferings, it will bee otherwise ere long, <hi>Christ</hi> is at hand.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:17825:193"/>
Againe, that wee might continually be breathing out thankefulnesse to God. Our whole life should be spent in thankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to God. Even as the Angels in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven that stand in the presence of God, and the blessed spirits in heaven, they spend that vigour that is in them: they spend all that is in them, in praising God, in thanks and laud to God, and sing, Glory, glory: so before-hand knowing that ere long we shall appeare with <hi>Christ,</hi> and appeare in glory, let us thank him before hand. As Saint <hi>Peter</hi> saith, <hi>Blessed be God that hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>us againe to an inheritance, immortall, unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, &amp;c. reserved in heaven for us.</hi> Let us blesse God before-hand, as if we were in heaven alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Certainely if we hope to be with those that shall sit in heavenly places in heaven to prayse God, we will begin it on earth: for the life of heaven is begun on earth, we are Kings now, we are Priests now, wee are conquerours now, we are new creatures now: we must praise God, and begin the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploiment of heaven now for what they do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, that we begin to do. In heaven we know there is no ill company, we will abstaine from it now; there is no defilement of sinne, wee will conforme our selves to that estate wee hope for: There is nothing but praising of God; as much as may be wee will warme our hearts with the moditation of what God hath done, what he doth, and what he hath reserved for the time to come, with that we have in hope.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:17825:194"/>
The best things of a Christian especially are in hope: for that which we have by <hi>Christ,</hi> principally is not in this world: therefore considering that the best things that <hi>Christ</hi> died for are in hope, <hi>let us rejoyce in hope,</hi> and in rejoycing have our hearts inlarged with pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of God, for that we hope for.</p>
                  <p>And be comforted in all the changes of this life, all the changes for the time to come, and in death it selfe, which is the last change: are not all degrees to make way for that glorious appearing with <hi>Christ?</hi> for the soule at death goes to heaven, and the body shall come after: why should wee be loath to die, when death is nothing but a change from mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to happinesse? a change from the danger of sinning, to an impossibility of sinning, from a vale of misery to a place of happinesse, from men to God, from sinfull persons that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our peace and quiet, to better company in heaven, from actions that are sinfull, to actions altogether free from sinne. It is a glorious and blessed change every way; wee shall have better company, better place, better im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, all glorious then, till the time come that all the Elect be gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and then body and soule shall <hi>be for ever with the Lord,</hi> 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 4. Why then should we <note place="margin">1 Thess. 4.</note> feare changes, when all changes shall end in that that is better? Is a labouring man loath to have his hire, or a weary man loath to have rest? is a King loath to be crowned? is a partie
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:17825:194"/>
contracted loath to have the marriage con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summate? why should wee bee loath to die? Wee should be ashamed of our selves, that we have bin so long in the Schoole of Christ, and yet have not learned to unloose our affections from earth, to beter things, that wee stand in feare of death, that makes way to the glory of the soule now; and the eternall glory of body, and soule after.</p>
                  <p>In a word, wee are exhorted in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Chapter, to have our minds in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, where Christ is, and wee are exhorted af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the text to mortifie our earthly members: two necessary duties, to have our conversation in heaven, <hi>before we be there, and to mortifie our earthly members,</hi> to dye in our affections to earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, before wee dye indeed; would wee have strength put into our soules to performe both these? Let us oft meditate of the things that are betweene these verses. Let us consider that we are dead, so we should bee more lively to God. Consider that our life is hid with Christ, that Christ shall appear ere long, and wee with him in glory. Wee should raise our thoughts to be with Christ, and draw our souls up to Heavenly things, for the more our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections are upwards, the lesse they will bee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: our affections are finice, the more we spend them on heavenly things, the lesse they will run on earthly. As a man in a trance, his thoughts are taken up with one matter, that he is dead to <note place="margin">Simile.</note> other things, so the soule which is taken up
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:17825:195"/>
with the glory to come, and with Christ, it is dead to earthly things, only it takes them for necessary use, as having use of them in our tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell, but it useth the world as if it used it not. And this issues from this principle, that wee shall ere long appeare with Christ in Glory. There is no man but will drowne himselfe too much with the things of the world, that hath not this to raise up his soule, I shall appeare ere long with <hi>Christ</hi> in glory, and then these things will be consumed.</p>
                  <p>The last point is, how these depend one up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another, that because Christ shall appeare in Glory, therefore we.</p>
                  <p>I will touch it a little, because it is a point of faith, that helpes our judgement a little. It is a ground of Divinity, that whatsoever is in us that are members, it is in our head first, for God is first, and then Christ mediator, and then we, whatsoever is good is in us, or shall be to us, it is in Christ first. He is justified from our sinnes, for he was our surety for sinne, hee was abased for them first: therefore hee shall appeare then without sin to Glory. Our sin was but impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Christ, he became our surety for sin, and he must be abased, therefore we cannot bee glo rious here, because of our corruptions. Christ was surety for our sinnes in his first comming: now his resurrection shewed, that hee had sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied for our sinnes; the second time he shall appear in glory: why are we justified from our sins? because <hi>Christ,</hi> our surety, was acquitted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:17825:195"/>
We ascend glorious<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> to heaven, where is the ground of it? he ascended first, and we ascend for him and in him.</p>
                  <p>We sit in heavenly places, why? because he is in heaven before hand: as the Husband takes up a place for his wife: why doth she goe into the countrey, and take it up after? because her husband hath gone before and taken it. Our as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension riseth from his, and our sitting at the right hand of God, from his.</p>
                  <p>And so at the day of judgement, our being glorious, it comes from his. He then shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in glory, as the head, and husband of his Church, and shall shine upon all his members. He, as the Sun, shall cast a lustre and beauty, and glory, upon all that are his, and then they shall reflect that glory they have from him, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him againe, and he upon them againe, so he shall be glorious in them, and they in him, but the ground of all is, he is first in glory, he shall appeare in glory, and then we in him.</p>
                  <p>I speake this the rather, because I would have humble consciences to make use of it in times of desertion, when God seemes to bee a God that hides himselfe, when they find no life nor comfort, yet if they have but grace to believe, they may comfort themselves in this: well, I have it but from Christ, and he is perfect in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, he is ascended, and I shall ascend, and rise, and be glorious, because hee is so: Put case now I feele no such matter: it is no matter, I live by faith in Christ, that hath all in fulnesse,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:17825:196"/>
and what hee hath done for me, hee will doe in me, if I believe in him.</p>
                  <p>Let a troubled soule comfort it selfe with this, it is as impossible that he should be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that believes in <hi>Christ,</hi> as that <hi>Christ</hi> should be damned, because hee believing in <hi>Christ,</hi> is one with him, and as verlly as <hi>Christ</hi> is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, hee shall bee there; for <hi>Christ</hi> rose for all his. The little finger lives the same life, as the <note place="margin">Simile.</note> hand or the foot doth; so a weake christian that hath little grace, he lives by the same faith in <hi>Christ</hi> that is in glory, as well as they that are stronger. Let us strive and fight with this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, as S. Paul saith, <hi>fight the good fight of Faith.</hi> Oh! but shall we be alwayes figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and striving? No saith hee, lay hold of <hi>eternall Life,</hi> and then wee may well fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst doubts and despaire. Let us therefore labour to fight so, that we may lay hold on eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, which <hi>Christ</hi> keepes for us, and keeps us for it, and ere long we shall partake of that wee hope for.</p>

                     </hi> here, there may be a spirit of cast-awayes in many, and in the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of meanes there may bee many dead souls. But S. <hi>Paul</hi> regards not what their course was, for saith he, <hi>our conversation is in Heaven.</hi>
                     <q>
                        <pb n="39" facs="tcp:17825:198"/>
From whence we looke for the Saviour, &amp;c.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That shewes why his conversation was in heaven, because his Saviour was in heaven, and therefore his hope was in heaven, <hi>Where the treasure is, the heart will be.</hi> Having entred into this blessed discourse, he goes on still, <hi>who shall change our vile bodies, and fashion them like his glorious body.</hi> He brings it in by way of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering an objection. If our conversation be in heaven, why are our bodies yet subject to such afflictions and basenesse in this world? It is true they are; but the time shall come that <hi>Christ</hi> shall change these vile bodies of ours, and fashion <hi>them like to his glorious body.</hi> I, but this requires a great deale of power and strength, and we see not how it may be. Therefore saith he, he shall doe it by <hi>that almighty power, whereby he is able to subdue all things to himselfe,</hi> therefore he shall subdue death, the last enemy; he will not doe it perhaps according to thy fancy and conceit, but <hi>according to the working whereby hee is able to subdue all things to himselfe:</hi> we must not regard our weake conceits in great matters, but Gods power; yee erre (saith <hi>Christ</hi> to the Pharisees) <hi>not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> then in these words, and in the verse before, sets downe three reasons why his course is opposite to the course of wicked men in his time.</p>
                  <p>First, my City is in heaven, and my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation is answerable, I take a contrary
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:17825:199"/>
course, for I am a citizen of another City.</p>
                  <p>And then another reason is, his hope and expectation of a Saviour from heaven, the Lord <hi>Iesus.</hi> Hope &amp; faith, which is the ground of hope, carry up the soule where the thing ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for is, <hi>Our conversation is in heaven, wee hope for a Saviour from thence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third reason is, from the condition of the body, how ever it was now for the present, <hi>He shall change our vile body, that it may be like his glorious body.</hi>
                     <q>Who shall change our vile body.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>You see here the Apostle having set him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe upon a holy and heavenly meditation, he could not satisfie himselfe, but goes from point to point, setting downe his present holy conversation, grounded upon his future hope of a blessed state to come. <hi>Christ shall change our vile body.</hi> Our bodies are vile, and our bodies, here is the point then that,
<q>The best mens bodies in this world are vile.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Vile in regard of the matter whence they are taken, the earth, from the dust; the fairest bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is but well coloured dust; base and vile from the beginning, from the wombe, base in the whole life, base in death; most base after death. They are base I say in the beginning.</p>
                  <p>But especially, base in our life; our bodies are base in regard of labour; <hi>Man is borne to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour</hi> (in this world) <hi>as the sparkes flie upward.</hi> God would humble the body of every man with labour, or else those that have not the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:17825:199"/>
of men here, shall have the labour of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils hereafter. The best body of the best Saints, are condemned to labour.</p>
                  <p>Vile, likewise in regard of sicknesse, and diseases, which grow out of the body, so that be it kept never so warme and tenderly, yet as the wormes grow out of the very wood, and <note place="margin">Simile.</note> consumes the wood that breeds it: so diseases grow out of, and come from the body. There is a fight, and conflict betweene moysture and heate, till the one prey upon the other, and consume it. In regard of sickenesse therefore they are vile bodies.</p>
                  <p>In regard likewise of disposing the soule the worst way: for take all tempers of the body, they incline the soule to some sinne or other, to some ill disposition or other. <hi>Choller,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines it to intemperate anger. <hi>Melancholy,</hi> to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trust, and darkenesse of spirit. The <hi>Sanguine,</hi> inclines it to liberty and loosenesse, &amp;c. <hi>Phlegme,</hi> to deadnesse, and dulnesse of spirit. So our base bodies make the soule dull, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes an unfit instrument, whereby the soule cannot worke as it would; an unfit house; the body is oft times a darke house: some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a house that drops in with moist disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, a house that lets in water, and so consumes it to rottennesse; sometimes, it is a house fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by hote diseases, it is thus indisposed, and therefore a vile body.</p>
                  <p>A vile body likewise, that when it is thus indisposed, there is no comfort in the earth
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:17825:200"/>

                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:17825:201"/>
that can comfort it: for all the foundation of comfort in this world, is the health of this poore body. A Kingdome, nay all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes in the world will not comfort a man, if his body be not in tune, and alas, how soone is this body out of tune? An instrument that hath many strings, is soone subject to be out of tune, and there are many strings in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: how many turnings? how many instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments doth the soule use? if any be out of tune, the musicke is hindred, it becomes an unfit instrument, in this regard it is a vile body.</p>
                  <p>In regard likewise of the necessities of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture this body is vile in this world. I speake not of what comes from the body, in which respect it is base and vile: but how many things doth this vile body stand in need of? man in that respect, is the basest creature in the world; he is b-holding to the wormes, he is beholding to nature to feed him in health, &amp; in sickenes the body needs patching up, and piecing by this creature, and by that; so it is a vile body, in regard of the necessities of it, in health, in sickenesse, in youth, in age. It is vile in life. I need not stand on this.</p>
                  <p>It is more vile in death, in the houre of death, then it is base and vile indeed; can wee indure the sight of our dearest friends? how noysome is their presence after death? and the most exquisite temper, is the most vile, and noysome of all; those that are most delicately
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:17825:201"/>
fed, and most beautifully faced, are most of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive, and this is the condition of all. That head that wore a Crowne, those hands that swayed a Scepter; those braines, and that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding that ruled many Kingdomes, all are subject to death, yea, and to basenesse after death, as well as those that are poorer. And then they are vile bodies, because they are subject to all manner of deaths: the bodies of Gods Saints have beene cast out to the fowles of the Ayre; the poore Martyrs, how many wayes have they tasted of death? These bodyes are subject to all manner of deaths, to variety of deaths, therefore they are vile bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
                  <p>And then they are vile after death; as wee were taken out of dust at the first, so we returne to dust againe; and if these bodies be not transformed to be like the glorious body of <hi>Christ,</hi> they are most vile of all. The spirit of despayre, the spirit of anger that, is in repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate persons, how doth it disfigure their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? one may see their shame, their griefe, their despayre in their very lookes; so their bodies are most vile, and dishonourable: but I speake of Gods Children. I say here in this world, in regard that they come of parents that are miserable and sinfull, <hi>Man that is borne of a woman, hath but a short time to live, and is full of misery, Iob</hi> 14. 1. Man that is borne of a woman, of a weake, miserable, sinfull wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, <note place="margin">Iohn 14. 1.</note> in this respect it is a vile body. And in
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:17825:202"/>
all the passages of our life, in respect of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and paine, and sickenesses, and diseases; and likewise for indisposing the soule, that it is an instrument to ill: and in death it selfe, more vile then in life, and after death most of all vile. So you see they are vile bodies every way. To make some use of this.</p>
                  <p>If this be so, considering what the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our body is here; let this abate the pride of the greatest: let them consider, when they looke upon their gay apparell, what doth these garments hide? when great Magistrates, and others have their purple on, let them consider, what doth this glorious garment cover? nothing but dust, a vile bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, why should wee be proud then of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, or of any ornament of our body, seeing it is a vile body?</p>
                  <p>Againe, if our bodies be vile and base, why should wee spend the strength of our soules in searching to satisfie the lusts of so vile a body? and so make our soules nothing else almost, but stewards to proule how to content, how to cloath and how to feed this body? as it is the study of many idle, vaine persons, almost all the day long, to give contentment to the craving lusts of this vile body, they make even an idoll of this poore, base piece of flesh, and sacrifice the best of their thoughts, and the best of their studies, and indeavours, and labours to the contentment of it: certainly this is forgotten,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:17825:202"/>
which the Apostle saith here, <hi>It is a vile and base body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe, is our body a vile body, a base bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as wee have it here? then let us not make it more vile by intemperate courses, as wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked persons doe, they dishonour their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. They are vile indeed, make the best of them we can, and they will end in dust; but we ought not sinfully to make them more vile and base, as many wretched persons doe by their loose and licencious courses of life.</p>
                  <p>Againe, if our bodies be vile base bodies, while we live here, let us not offend God for any thing to gratifie our vile bodies, let us doe as <hi>Ioseph</hi> did, when his mistris tempted him, he left his garment behind him rather: so when we are tempted to any sinne, let us ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leave our garments behind us, let us leave our bodies, they are but vile bodies, let us be stripped of them, rather then offend God. It is pittifull to consider how this vile body, as vile as it is, and shall be in death, how it tyrannizeth over the poore soule, and how men wound their soules for their bodies. How many are there that justifie errours that they condemne in their hearts, to live a lazy, idle, a full, a plentifull life? and how many doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne those things, those courses, and those truths, (to please others, and to live a large, and idle life) which they justifie in their very soules? and all to please the flesh. It is but a
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:17825:203"/>
bad counsellor, a bad solicitor, I say it tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizeth over the poore soule. Let us not offend God or conscience, to breake the peace of it for any thing, to gratifie this vile flesh. This I thought good to touch concerning that. 
<q>Who shall change our vile bodies. Change.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The action that <hi>Christ</hi> shall exercise about them is <hi>Change. Christ</hi> will <hi>Change</hi> our vile bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. They are vile now, they shall not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes so, but <hi>Christ</hi> will <hi>Change</hi> our vile bodies. He will not give us other bodies for them: but hee will change them in regard of quality. For even as the great world was the same after the flood, as it was before the flood, and shall be when it is consumed by fire, it shall be a new world for quality, but the same for substance: so this body of ours, it shall be the same after the resurrection for substance, that it is now: it shall be altered for quality, it shall not be changed for substance. Therefore he shall change, he shall not abolish our vile bodies. This is the action that our blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour will exercise upon these vile bodies, they shall be changed. Man is the most chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able creature in the world, for soule and for body too.</p>
                  <p>Take him in his soule, how many states is he in? There is first the state of nature in perfection; and then the state of corruption in originall sinne; and then the state of grace in the new creature, and then the state of glory.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:17825:203"/>
So likewise he is changeable in his body, hee was first taken out of the dust, out of the dust God made this glorious creature of mans bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; he is a painefull creature, in labour, in sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and then from strength he is changed to old age, and from thence to death, and dust, and from dust then he is changed againe to a more glorious estate then ever he was in: the body is made like the glorious body of Christ, hee is changeable in soule and in body.</p>
                  <p>But this is our comfort, we shall change for the best, all the changes of our bodyes serve for the last change, after which, there shall never bee any more change, when they are changed once to be glorious, they shall be for ever glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious: a blessed change, a blessed estate of a chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, all his changes tend to a state that shall never change: for after these bodies are once changed from base, to bee glorious, they shall be for ever glorious, </p>

His first comming was to change our

soules, to deliver them from the bondage of Satan; his second comming shall be to deliver our bodies from the bondage of Corruption, that is, the day of <hi>the Redemption of our bodies,</hi> as the Apostle cals it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.

of quality, and not in regard of equality: our body shall be like his glorious body, not equall to his glorious body.

                     <hi>Whatsoever is in us, both for soule and body, (but here wee speake of the body) whatsoever excellency is in us, it is at the second hand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is first in our head, first in Christ, and then in us, He is first the Sonne of God by nature, wee are the Sonnes of God by Adoption: hee is the predestinated Sonne of God to save us, to be our head, we are predestinate to be his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; he is the sonne of Gods love, wee are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved in him, hee is full of grace, <hi>of his fulnesse we recieve grace for grace;</hi> hee rose, and we shall rise, because hee rose first: Hee ascended into Heaven, by vertue of his ascention, wee shall ascend into heaven too. Hee sits at the right
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:17825:205"/>
hand of God inglory, and by vertue of his sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, we sit there together with him in heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly places. Whatsoever is graciously, or glo riously good that is in us, it is first in our bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and glorious Saviour.</p>
                  <p>Therefore let us looke to him, and be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to God for him: when we thanke God for our selves, let us thanke God first for giving Christ who is the patterne to whom wee are conformed. Let us give thanks for him, as S. <hi>Peter</hi> doth, <hi>Blessed be God, the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ:</hi> if he had not bin his Father, hee had not bin ours. Wee cannot stand before God of our selves, but in one that is perfect in himselfe, God-Man. Therefore when we blesse God for grace, and glory that belongs to us, let us blesse him for giving Christ, that in him we are happy, he conformes us in grace here, and in glory hereafter, in body and soule to our glorious Saviour.</p>
                  <p>And as it is a ground of thankfulnesse to God for Christ, so it yeelds us a rule for medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: when we would thinke of any thing in our selves, let us goe to our head, to Christ, in whom we have all we have, and that wee hope to have: <hi>of his fulnes we receive, not only grace for grace,</hi> but glory for glory: of all the glory he hath, we have answerable to him; and surely it is a trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming meditation, to think of <hi>Christs</hi> glory, and to see our selves in him, to thinke of grace in Christ, and of our interest in grace in him, we must not thinke of him as an abstracted head,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:17825:205"/>
severed from us, but thinke of his glory, and our glory in him and by him, he is glorious, and we shall be glorious likewise.</p>
                  <p>Againe you see here, that how soever our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes are vile for the present, yet they shall not be so for ever, they shall be glorious bodyes, like to CHRISTS Body; the point then is that,</p>

Let us put honour upon these bodyes, that shall be thus honoured, let us use them for honourable purposes. Let us lift up our eyes to Heaven, let us reach forth our hands to good workes: let our feet that have carried us to ill heretofore, carry us to the service of God; for these very vile Bodyes, shall bee glorious bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes. The very same eyes that have bin lift up to God in prayer, those very hands that now are instruments of good workes, those very knees that are humbled to God in prayer, and those feet that have carried us to holy exercises, and those spirits that are wasted and spent in holy

meditation, even these, this vile body, that is thus holily used, shall be a glorious body, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us use it answerably.</p>
                  <p>And labour to lay it downe with honour in the dust, to leave it with a good report to the world, considering it shall be so glorious after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Doe those thinke of this, that use their bodyes for base purposes? whose eyes are full of Adultery, whose hands are full of rapine, whose feet carry them to base places, where they defile themselves, whose bodyes, every member is a weapon and instrument of sinning against God? How can these dare to thinke of that glorious day, wherein our vile bodyes shal be made like the glorious body of Christ, can they hope that those hands, and those feet of that body, shall be made glorious, that have bin defiled? that have bin instruments to make o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers likewise sinne? can such a body looke for glory? let us not deceive our selves; this vile body indeed shall be a glorious body. I but it must bee used accordingly, unlesse wee have a presumptuous hope.</p>
                  <p>This body shall bee glorious, this very vile body, <hi>this corruptible shall put on incorruption,</hi> the same body, as the Apostle saith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>I</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the resurrection of this body, as we say in the Creed. S. <hi>Paul</hi> pointed to his own body, this body, this <hi>mortall</hi> shall put on <hi>immortality.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If this body shall be glorious, how base so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be in this world, then againe let us ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour poore Christians, though we see them vile

and base; and honour aged Christians, and deformed: alas, looke not on them as they are, but as they shall be, as they are in the decree of Christ, and as they shall bee ere long by the power of Christ, hee will make them like his glorious body. Let us not despise weake, or old, or deformed persons, these vile bodies shall be glorious: those that died in martyrdome, whose bodies were cast into the fire, and cast to wild beasts, &amp;c. they shall be glorious bodyes. The Emperour <hi>Constantine</hi> wold kisse the very holes of the eyes of those that had their eyes pulled out, that had bin martyrd: So even our vile bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes, when they are used in the service of God, in suffering, they shall bee glorious bodyes, let us honour our bodyes, or theirs that suffer for Christ. S. <hi>Paul</hi> made it his plea, and a ground of his confidence, because his body was vile for Christ. <hi>I Paul a prisoner of Iesus Christ, and I carry in my body the marks of the Lord Iesus. The dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Christ, that the life of Christ might bee mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest.</hi> He carried <hi>Christs</hi> marks in his body: making this an argument of respect, that he was a priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: so when any are abased for Christs sake, let us think these are such as shall have glorious bodies, how ere they are esteemed of the world. But to enlarge the point a little further, these bodyes shall be made like the body of Christ.</p>
                  <p>Wherein shall this Glory of our bodyes <note place="margin">Quest.</note> consist?</p>
                  <p>Especially in these six indowme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, our bodies <note place="margin">Answer.</note> be now vile, and perhaps imperfect, they want a

member, a sence or a limbe, our bodyes then shall be perfect, even as Christs body is. Those martyrs that have bin dismembred, shall then have perfect bodyes. Let us not bee asrayd to lose a limbe, or a joynt, for Christ, or a good cause, if our bodyes bee made vile for Christ, they shall be made perfect afterward.</p>
                  <p>Then again, our Bodyes then shall be beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Adam in his innocency had such a beauty in his body, that the very creatures reverenced him, he was awfull to the very creatures: so the body of our blessed Saviour, now in heaven, is wondrous beautifull, and so shall our bodyes be, how deformed soever they be now. Let us not stand therefore upon any present deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our bodyes now, with yeares<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or sicknesse, or other meanes, they shall not alway be so, we shall have beautifull bodyes.</p>
                  <p>Nay more then so, the third indowment is, we shall have glorious bodyes: as we see Christ in the mount, when hee was transfigured, and <hi>Moses,</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> were with him, his body was glorious, they could hardly behold him. And Christ, in <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. he appeares, <hi>as the Sunne in his</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Revel. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>full strength,</hi> his body is wondrous glorious now in Heaven, and so hee is represented there: If the very representation of him while he was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth, was so glorious in the mount, what is it in Heaven? S. Paul could not endure the light that shined to him. <hi>Act.</hi> 9. So shall our <note place="margin">Act. 9.</note> Bodies bee, like the glorious Body of <hi>Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What a glorious time will it be, when the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:17825:207"/>
glorious body of <hi>Christ</hi> shall appeare, and all the Saints shall appeare in glory? what a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion of beauty and glory will there be, one shining upon another, <hi>when Christ shall come to be glorious in his Saints?</hi> Oh! the glory of the body of Gods children, it shall put downe all created glory, all the glory of the Sunne, and Moone, and all the glory of these inferiour bodies are nothing to the glory of the body of a Christian, that doth abase his body here for <hi>Christ,</hi> and the Churches sake. You see then these bodies shall be perfect, and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and glorious bodies in regard of the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>e of them.</p>
                  <p>And likewise in the fourth place, they shall be immortall bodies, bodies that shall never die, unchangeable bodies; there shall be no al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toration, no death, no sicknesse, all teares shall be wiped <hi>from our eyes,</hi> they shall be immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall bodies that shall never die, as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> saith, <hi>Wee shall have an inheritance undefiled, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall, &amp;c.</hi> This is cleare, therefore I will not stand in the inlarging of it.</p>
                  <p>In the next place, our bodies shall be powerfull and vigorous: now they are weake, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. Our bodies are <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.</note>

                  <p>In the sixth place they shall be spirituall
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:17825:208"/>
bodies, that is, they shall not stand in need of meat, and drinke, and sleepe, and refreshings, as now they doe, but <hi>Christ</hi> will be all in all to them, he will be instead of meat and drinke, &amp; cloathes: yea, and in stead of the Ordinances that we stand in need of here, the Word, and Sacraments, he will be all in all. And our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies shall be spirituall in another regard, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they shall be subject to the spirit; whereas now our very spirits are flesh, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the flesh rules and tyrannizeth over them: so our soules follow our bodies, the soule of a carnall man is flesh; but then out flesh, our bodies shall be spirituall, not that they shall be turned into spirits, that is not the meaning, but spirituall bodies; obedient and obsequious to the very guidance of the soule, to a sanctified and glorious soule: these shall be the indowments of our bodies. They shall be perfect bodies, beautifull, glorious, shining bodies, immortall, unchangeable bodies, powerfull, strong, and vigorous bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, ready to moove from place to place, and spirituall bodies, they shall stand in need of no other helpe; and they shall be obedient altogether to the spirit. You see now, how these vile bodies draw away our soules; then all imperfections shall be taken away, wee shall have purged bodies, and purged soules. Thus you see wherein the glory of the body shall consist.</p>
                  <p>Let us therefore often seriously thinke of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:17825:208"/>
these things: and let me renew my former ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation: let us be content to make our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies here vile for <hi>Christs</hi> sake, that they may be thus glorious. Let us abase them in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and paines in our calling, in suffering, we doe no more then he did for us first. Was not his body first vile, and then glorious? and doe we thinke that our bodies must not be vile before they be glorious? not onely vile whether we will or no; but we must willingly make them vile, we must be willing to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced for <hi>Christs</hi> sake, to carry his death about us, to <hi>die daily,</hi> in the resolution of our soules. How was he abased before he was glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious? hee tooke on him our bodies at the worst, not in the perfection as it was created: but hee tooke the body of man now fallen. Againe, what paines did hee take in this bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy? and how was he disgraced in this body? that sacred face was spit upon, those blessed hands and feet, were nayled to the Crosse, that blessed head, that is revere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ced of the Angels, it was crowned with thornes. How was his body every way, in all the parts of it, abased and made vile for us? he neglected his refreshings for us: it <hi>was meate and drinke to him</hi> to doe good. If he became vile for us, if he abased his body for us, certainely wee should be ashamed, if wee be not content that our bodies should be made vile for him, that afterwards they may be made like his glorious body. Away with these nice Christians, that
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:17825:209"/>
are afraid of the wind blowing on them, or the Sunne shining upon them, that are afraid to doe any thing, or to suffer any thing, and so in sparing their bodies, destroy both body and soule. Consider, whoever thou art, this is not a life for thy body, this present life is a life for the soule: we come now to have the Image of God in our soules in this life espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, and to have in our soules the life of grace here; but the life and happinesse of our body, is for this second comming of <hi>Christ,</hi> the glory of the body, this life is not a time for the body; doe what wee can it will be a vile body; cherish it, set it out how thou canst, those painted sepulchres that would out-face age, and out-face death, and by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours and complexion, &amp;c. hide those fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes that age makes in the face, they are but vile, and age, and death will be too good for them, to dust they will. Why should we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard our bodies? this life is not for them, though we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> dainty of them. Let us use this body here so, as it may be glorious in the world to come: we should suffer our soules to rule our bodies, and to doe all here, that both body and soule may be glorious after. For indeed all that the body hath here, it is behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the soule for, why therefore should it not be an instrument for the soule in holy things? doth not the soule quicken it? hath it not its beauty from the soule? when the soule is gone out of the body, where is the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:17825:209"/>
life? where is the beauty, where is any thing? the body is a loathsome carkasse. Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore while the soule is in this body, looke to the soule especially, that when the soule shall goe to heaven, the soule be mindfull of, and speake a good word for the body; as <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Butler did for <hi>Ioseph,</hi> that the soule there may thinke of the body, that it may thinke of the paines, of the suffering; as the soule doth, it hath an apetite in heaven, a desire to be joyned againe to the body, which it useth to labour in, to pray to God in, which it used to fast in, which it used as an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to good actions. Let us use it so here; that the soule may desire to meete it againe, that <hi>Christ</hi> at that day may bring body and soule together to be glorious for ever.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We see here then, that the best is to come; the best change, after which there shall be no change, is to come. The weakest is the first, and the second is better, the second <hi>Adam</hi> is better then the first, and the second life shall be better then the first; our bodies as they shall be glorious, shall be better then they were in the first creation: they shall be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious bodies, like unto <hi>Christs.</hi> Oh! the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of a Christian, there is nothing that is behind, nothing to come, but it is for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; there shall be a change, but it shall be a change for the better. A Christian is a person full of hope, he is under a glorious hope, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

a <hi>hope of glory</hi> of soule and body, he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way under hope, the <hi>hope of glory;</hi> therefore <hi>he joyes under this hope, Rom.</hi> 5. 1.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>I answer, hee may know it from this.</p>
                  <p>The change of a Christian begins in his <note place="margin">Answer.</note> soule: <hi>Christ</hi> begins the change of our soules to be like his, full of love, and obedience to God, full of pitty, and compassion to men, full of industry to doe good; our soules will be like <hi>Christs</hi> soule: first looke to thy soule, what stampe that beares, is there the Image of <hi>Christ</hi> on thy soule? certainely he that hath transformed this soule to be gracious, he will transforme the body to be glorious, like his glorious body. Looke to thy soule then; if thou art the child of God by adoption, if thou hast the spirit of adoption and grace, and findest peace of conscience, and joy in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-Ghost; thou maist know thou shalt have the adoption of thy body, thou hast the first adoption, in thy soule, thou art the child of God; know that thou shalt have the second adoption spoken of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>Wee wayte for the adoption of our bodyes.</hi> If thou partake of <hi>the</hi>

                  <p>For <hi>Christ</hi> is a perfect Saviour, hee saves

not onely the soule, but the body, though hee begin with the soule, he ends with the body. He tooke our bodies as well as our soules, and hee will glorifie our bodies, as well as our soules; and if wee find the worke of grace, a <hi>Spirit of glory</hi> in our soules, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly wee may know that our bodyes shall be glorious.</p>
                  <p>Againe, thou maist know that thou shalt partake of this glorious estate, that thy body shall be like the glorious body of <hi>Christ,</hi> by the use that this body is put to; how doest thou use this vile body for the time thou li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest now? dost thou use it to the base services of sinne? doest <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

the wife, and the husband; the body is a fellow-heire with the soule of glory, he will not use it to the base services of sinne. Hee that shall have a glorious body, will esteeme so of it here. What, shall I use the Temple of the Holy-Ghost, that, that is a fellow-heire of heaven with my soule, that is the Spouse of <hi>Christ,</hi> a member of <hi>Christ,</hi> as well as my soule, shall I use it to these, and these base services?

                  </p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> gives three Evidences in one place, to know our interest in this glory <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 1.</note> of our bodies, in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1. saith hee, <hi>wee know that when this earthly house, or Tabernacle shall be disolved, wee have a building, &amp;c.</hi> We know we have a glorious building, a double building, heaven and our bodies, wee have two glorious houses, heaven, and these bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies shall be a glorious house, But how doe we know this?</p>
                  <p>Saith he, in the second verse, we groane <hi>ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly, desiring to be cloathed upon:</hi> there is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous desire after this cloathing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>The creature groaneth, much more wee that have the first fruits of the Spirit.</hi> There will be a sighing for this glory, awayting for the blessed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:17825:211"/>
of <hi>Christ;</hi> for <hi>Christ</hi> to redeeme soule and body perfectly, that is the first signe, a desire and groaning earnestly.</p>
                  <p>In the fourth verse there is another evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, <hi>He that hath wrought us for the same things i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap> God.</hi> He that hath wrought us for the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed estate to come, is God: so, whosoever hopes for a house in heaven, when this Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle is dissolved, he is <hi>wrought for it,</hi> that is, he is a new creature for it; God hath wrought his soule and body for it. God fits our soules here, to possesse a glorious body after, and hee will fit the body for a glorious soule, so both shall be glorious, a glorious soule, and a glorious body, he hath <hi>wrought us</hi> for the same. If a man therefore find the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the new creature, that it is begun to be wrought in him, he may know that he shall partake of this glory of the body, because He is <hi>wrought</hi> for it.</p>
                  <p>The third is, <hi>Who hath also given us the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest of the Spirit,</hi> whosoever finds in them the Spirit of God, sanctifying their soules and bodies, stirring them up to holy duties, guiding, and leading, and mooving them to holy actions; they may from the sanctifying Spirit, that is an earnest to them, know what shall become of their bodies, <hi>Hee hath given us the earnest of the Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To confirme this, there is an excellent place in <hi>Ro.</hi> 8. 10: <hi>If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his. If Christ bee in you the body is</hi>
                     <pb n="64" facs="tcp:17825:212"/>
                     <hi>dead, &amp;c.</hi> It is a vile body, it as good as dead, it hath the sentence of death already, it is dead, in regard it is sentenced to death for sinne, as a malefactor that hath his sentence: <hi>But the Spirit is life in regard of righteousnesse.</hi> What then? if the sanctifying Spirit of <hi>Christ</hi> dwell in you, <hi>Hee that raised Iesus from the dead, shall also quicken your mortall bodies.</hi> The same Spirit that sanctifies these soules of ours, our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and quickens them to holy duties, the same Spirit shall raise our bodies. As the same Spirit that sanctified the blessed masse of the body of <hi>Christ,</hi> that he carryed, and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed his body, the same Spirit that sanctifies our soules, shall raise our bodies. The Spirit of God when hee hath begun to sanctifie us, he never leaves us, hee goes along in all chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, in life, in death, to the grave, (as God said to <hi>Iacob, I will be with thee there.)</hi> The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, he will mold our dead bodies, and make them like the glorious body of <hi>Christ;</hi> the Spirit of God never leaves our soules or bodies. Therefore if wee find the earnest of the Spirit, if we find the worke of the Spirit, or the comfort of the Spirit, (which is the tearme the Scripture gives) <hi>Ioy in the Holy-Ghost and peace of conscience;</hi> together with the Spirit sanctifying us, especially in the time of trouble, when God sees his Children have most need, they have the earnest of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the beginnings of grace and joy, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of heaven upon earth; by this they

may know, as the first fruit is, so likewise is the harvest; as the earnest is, even so is the bargaine; as wee have it now in our soules, so we shall also have it in our bodies, and soules hereafter. These three grounds Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hath, why his hope of heaven was a good hope, wee groane for it, and wee are wrought for it; wee are fitted for it. There is no man can hope to be glorious in his body, but his soule must be fitted for it, it must be a fit jewell for so glorious a casket, a fit inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant for so glorious a Temple, as the body shall be, the body shall be fitted for the soule, and the soule for the body, they are <hi>wrought for it.</hi> And then hee hath given us the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest of the Spirit. What need I quote further evidences the, Scripture being thus pregnant?</p>
                  <p>I beseech you often consider your desires, whether you be content to live here alway or no, to satisfie the vile lusts of your body, or whether you desire to be dissolved and to <hi>be with Christ,</hi> when you have done the worke that God sent you for into the world: if wee be content to abase our selves for God here, who hath provided so much glory for us here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, and when the time comes, we can desire to be dissolved, and to be with <hi>Christ,</hi> it is a good signe, (if wee have the beginnings of the new creature, <hi>yee are wrought</hi> for it) that our soules are fitted for a glorious body, we have <hi>the earnest of the Spirit:</hi> the same Spirit that
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:17825:213"/>
sanctifieth our soules, and that quickens our soules with joy and peace, the same Spirit shall raise our bodies. Comfort your selves you that are Christians (though you bee weake) with this, that if you have but the earnest of the Spirit, undoubtedly you shall have a glorious house instead of this tabernacle of dust.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Christ</hi> will change these vile bodies, that they shall be <hi>fashioned like his glorious body.</hi> I beseech you therefore oft thinke of this, think of the time to come, comfort your selves with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> things to come. In 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 4. Saint <note place="margin">1 Thess. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> would have us talke one to another often of this, this should be the matter of our confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, not onely the state of the Church and our owne estate here, but how it shall be with us when we are gone hence, how it shall be with us world without end hereafter, we should conferre, and speake, and oft meditate and thinke of these things.</p>
                  <p>What can be grievous? what can be over burdensome to that soule that knowes it hath the pledge, and earnest of glory hereafter? How doth it quicken the soule to any indeavour, when once we know, that how soever we abase our selves here, yet we shall have glorious bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies hereafter. It will quicken us to any indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, to any thing for <hi>Christ:</hi> therefore let us oft thinke of our estate to come, let us set our thoughts foreward to the time to come: Let faith make the times to come present,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:17825:213"/>
and that will make us heavenly minded. What made Saint <hi>Paul</hi> converse as if he were in heaven? faith made the estate to come present, and hope, which is grounded on faith, it lookes to <hi>Christs</hi> comming, to change our vile bodies, so faith and hope, they make the soule looke upward, they make it heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly minded.</p>
                  <p>Our soules are dull, and our bodies are dull in this world; but as Iron if it be touched with a Load stone, up it will; so if wee get faith, and hope to looke foreward, what shall be done to us for the time to come? the spirit of faith and hope if it touch the soule, will carry our dull bodies, and our dead soules upward.</p>
                  <p>Therefore let us cherish our faith and hope, by often meditation of the blessed estate to come, and thinke of these two things, of the excellent estate of our bodies and soules then: for if our bodies shall then be glorious like the body of <hi>Christ,</hi> our soules much more; the inhabitant, which is the speciall part, the soule shall be much more glorious. Let us thinke oft of this glory as it is described in the Word; it transcends our thoughts: wee cannot thinke high enough of it, and our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, and assurance of it. And daily search our selves, whether our hope be good or no, that we have sound evidence, that our title is good to glory. Let us examine our selves by those signes I named before. Where are our
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:17825:214"/>
desires? what worke hath the Spirit of God in us? how doe we use these bodies of ours? As we use them now, wee must looke they shall be used hereafter. Let our tongues be our glory now, and they shall be glor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ous tongues afterward to praise God in heaven: their bodies that have beene glorious here, shall be glorious in heaven. Wee may read our estate to come, by that we are here: those that carry themselves basely, and filthily, and dishonourably here, we may know what will become of them hereafter. Let us oft thinke of the estate to come, and of our interest in it; and both these together, the excellency of the estate, and our interest in it without deceiving of our soules, what life will it put into all our carriage? what will be grievous to us in this world, when our soules are thus settled? Oh, let us spend a few dayes fruitfully and painfully here amongst men, and doe all the good we can, and use these bodies of ours to all the happy, and blessed services we can; why? wee shall have glory more then we can imagine.</p>
                  <p>Let it comfort us in the houre of death, what death soever we die, or are designed to. Now you know the sickenesse is abroad, and alas those bodies especially are vile bodies that are under the visitation; so then, that their dearest friends, dare not come neare them: yet let this comfort us; they are vile bodies for a time, put case wee die the death
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:17825:214"/>
that may hinder the comforts of this life. Those that die in much honour and pompe, and have their bodies imbalmed, doe all what they can with the body, it will come to dust and rottennesse; it will be vile in death, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death, at one time or other, and those that die never so vile and violent a death for Gods sake; those that die of this base death, that they are deprived of much comfort; yet let it comfort them, <hi>Christ</hi> will transforme their vile bodies to be glorious.</p>
                  <p>They talke much of the Philosophers stone, that it will change metals into gold, here is the true Stone, that will change our vile bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to be glorious. Let us die never so base or violent a death, let us comfort our selves in our owne death, if it be thus with us, and in the death of our friends, these vile bodies, when they are most vile in death, they shall be made like the glorious bodie of <hi>Christ.</hi> Let us oft thinke of these things.</p>

These words I have read to you, they are <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laams</hi> desire, <hi>Balaams</hi> acclamation. Diverse questions might be moved concerning <hi>Balaam,</hi> which I will not stand upon, but come direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the words, wherein are considerable these things.</p>
                  <p>First that the righteous men die, and have an end as well as others.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that the state of the soule conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues after death, it was in vaine for him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to dye the death of the righteous, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the subsistence of the soule.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly that the estate of righteous men in their end, is a blessed estate, because here it was the desire of <hi>Balaam: oh that I might dye the death of the righteous!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, there is an excellent estate of Gods people, and they desire that portion: <hi>oh let mee dye the death of the righteous.</hi> These are the foure things I shal unfold, which discover the intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Balaam,</hi> in these words.</p>
                  <p>For the first I wil touch it briefly, &amp; so go on.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The righteous dye, and in the same manner out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Observ.</hi> 1. The righteous die, as well as the wicked.</note> 
                     <hi>as the wicked doe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For Christ in his first comming came not to redeeme our bodies from death, but our soules from damnation, his second comming shall be to redeeme our bodyes from corruption, into a glorious liberty. Therefore wise men dye as well as fooles: those whose eyes and hands have beene lift up to God in prayer, and whose feet have carried them to the holy place, as well as
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:17825:217"/>
those whose eyes are full of adultery, and whose hands are full of blood, they dye all alike, in manner alike; ofttimes it is the same in the eye of the world; Death comes upon good and bad, but to the good for their greater glory, for the shell must be broken, before they come to the pearle; death it fits them for the blessed life after, the body lying a while in the grave, the soule being in the hands of God: and death now it makes an end of sinne that brought in death: and it makes us conformable to the son of God, our elder brother that dyed for us. The point is pregnant, and full of gracious and serious meditations.</p>
                  <p>It should enforce this excellent duty, that <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. To improove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap> the short time of life.</note> considering we have no long continuance here, therefore while we are here, to doe that, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we come into the world. As a factor that is sent into a place, to provide such goods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand: let us consider that here we are sent to get into a state of Salvation, to get out of the state of nature, into the state of grace, to furnish our soules with grace; to fit us for our dissolution to come: let us not forget the main end of our living here, considering we cannot be here long, let us doe the worke that God hath put into our hands, quickly and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with all our might.</p>
                  <p>And let it enforce moderation to all earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 2. To use the world mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratly.</note> things, <hi>the time is short, therefore let those that use the world, be as if they used it not, &amp;c.</hi> Those friends that have bin joyned together will part,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:17825:218"/>
therefore let us use our bodies and soules so, that we may present them both comfortably to God: Let us begge of God to make a right use of this fading condition. But I hasten.</p>
                  <p>The second point is this; that, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Observ.</hi> 2. The soule con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues after death.</note>
                     <q>The estate of the soule continues after death.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>For here he wisheth to die the death of the righteous, not for any excellency in death, but in regard of the subsistence and continuance of the soule after death.</p>
                  <p>Scripture, and reason, and nature, enforceth this, that the soule hath a subsistence of it selfe, distinct from the life it communicates to the body. There is a double life, a life proper to the soule, and the life it communicates to the <note place="margin">Life of the soule double.</note> body: now when the life it communicates to the body is gone to dissolution, it selfe hath a life in heaven. And indeed it is in a manner the whole man: for <hi>Abraham,</hi> was <hi>Abraham</hi> when he was dead, when his soule was in heaven, and his body in the grave, it is the whole man.</p>
                  <p>And it discovers indeed that it hath a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct life, and excellency in it selfe, by reason <note place="margin">1 <hi>Reason.</hi> It crosses the desires of the bodie.</note> that it thwarts the desires of the body when it is in the body. Reason, if there be no grace in the soule, that crosseth the inclination of the body; grace much more. And we see oft-times when the outward man is weake, as in sicknesse, <note place="margin">2 <hi>Reason.</hi> It operates most in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note> &amp;c. then the Understanding, Will, and affections, the inward man is most sublime, and rapt unto heaven, and is most wise. Take
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:17825:218"/>
a man that hath been besotted all his life time, that hath beene drunke with the pleasures of a carnall life, that hath beene a covetous wretch, an earth-worme, that enjoyes not heaven, but lives as his wealth, and lusts carry him in slave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; yet at the houre of death, when hee consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that he hath scraped together, and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the way that his lusts have lead him, and that all must leave him; now he begins to be wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>e, and speakes more discreetly, hee can speake of the vanity of these things, and how little good they can doe. Indeed many, way, the most men are not wise untill that time: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the soule of it selfe hath a distinct being, because when the body is lowest, it is most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, and strong in its operations.</p>
                  <p>Likewise it appeares by the projects that it <note place="margin">3 <hi>Reason.</hi> It projects for the time to come.</note> hath of the time to come: the soule especially of men, that are of more elevated and refined spirits; it projects for the time to come, what shall become of the Church and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, what shall become of posterity, and of reputation and credit in the world. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, unlesse there were a subsistence of it selfe, it would never looke so much before hand, and lay the grounds of the prosperity of the Church and Common-wealth, for the time to come: I will not stand further on it, but rather make some use of it. <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse.</hi> To use our soules to the end they were given.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us know which is our best part, namely the soule, that hath a being after death, that we doe not imploy it to base uses, for which it
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:17825:219"/>
was not made nor given us: doe we thinke that these soules of ours were made, and given us to scrape wealth? to travell in our affections to base things worse then our soules? are they not capable of supernaturall and excellent things? are they not capable of grace and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? of communion with God, of the blessed stampe of the Image of God? Let us use them therefore, to the end that God gave them. And let us not deserve so ill of our soules, as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray them, to cast them in the dirt, to lay our Crowne in the dust. This is our excellency, what can keepe our bodies from being a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed loathsome thing, if the soule be taken away? yet so we abase this excellent part; oft times we abase it to serve the base lusts of the body, which is condemned to rottenesse. What is the life of most men, but a purveying and prouling for the body? The lusts of the body set the wit, and affections on worke to proule for it selfe, what a base thing is this? Were our soules given us for this end? and especially considering this, that our soules are immortall, that they shall never die, but be for ever: let us not altogether spend this precious time that is given us to save our soules, and to get the Image of God stamped upon them, I say, let us not spend this precious time in things that will leave us when our soules shall live still: let us not carry the matter so, that our soules shall out-live our happinesse. All world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, <note place="margin">Worldly men out live their happinesse.</note> and base creatures, they out-live their
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:17825:219"/>
happinesse; for where do they plant it? in the base things of this life: all their life long they are prouling for those things that they must leave when they die: whereas their soules shall not die, but everlastingly subsist.</p>
                  <p>What a misery is this, that these soules of ours shall have a being, when the things wherein we placed our happinesse, and abused our soules to gaine them, they shall have an end? The soules of such men that seeke the things of this life, shall have a being in eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall misery. Indeed so it is; for these soules of ours, the same degree they have in excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, if they be used as they should, if we doe not abase them; the same degree they shall have in basenesse. and misery, if wee abuse them, and make them slaves to earthly things. For as the Devils the same degree they had of excellency when they were Angels; the same degree they have in misery, now they be De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils. The more excellent the creature is when it keepes its excellency; the more vile it is when it degenerates: so these soules of ours that next to Angels are the most excellent creatures of God; the more excellent it is, if it get the Image of God stamped upon it, and the new creature, and have the life of grace: the more cursed is the state of the soule, if it subsist to everlasting misery.</p>
                  <p>It were happy if the soules of such creatures were mortall, that labour for a happinesse in this life. Oh! that we would thinke of this.

Most men in the bosome of the Church (which is lamentable to thinke) they live as if they had no soules: They overturne the order, that God hath set, that hath given us our bodies to serve our soules; they use all the strength, and marrow of their wits; all the excellencies in their soules, for the base satisfaction of the lusts of the body, so much for that point.</p>

                  <p>But they are more happy in their death, and most happy, and blessed after death.</p>
                  <p>In their death they are happy in their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, <note place="margin">2 In death.</note> and happy, in condition.</p>
                  <p>Happy in their disposition; what is the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position <note place="margin">1 In disposition.</note>
                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:17825:222"/>
of a holy, and blessed man at his end? His disposition is by faith to give himselfe to God, by which faith he dies in obedience: he carries himselfe fruitfully, and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in his end. And oft times the nearer he is to happinesse, the more he layes about him to be fruitfull.</p>
                  <p>Besides his disposition, he is happy in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: <note place="margin">2 In condition.</note> for death is a sweet close: God, and he meet; grace, and glory meete: he is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven (as it were) before his time. What is death to him? The end of all misery, of all sin, of body and soule, it is the beginning of all true happinesse in both. This I might shew at large, but I have spoken somewhat of this point out of another Text. <note n="*" place="margin">See the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons on Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip. 3. 21.</note> They are hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in their death, for <hi>their death is precious in Gods sight:</hi> the Angels are ready to doe their attendance, to carry their soules to the place of happinesse. They are happy in their death, because they are in the Lord: when death se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers soule and body, yet notwithstanding, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther soule nor body are severed from <hi>Christ, They die in the Lord,</hi> therefore still they are happy. Much might be said to this purpose, and to good purpose, but that the point is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, and I hasten to presse things that I thinke will a little more confirme it. They are blessed in death.</p>
                  <p>And blessed after death especially: for then <note place="margin">3 After death:</note> we know they are in heaven, waiting for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of the body. There is a blessed
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:17825:223"/>
change of all; for after death we have a better place, better company, better imployment, all is for the better.</p>
                  <p>There are three degrees of life. <note place="margin">Three degrees of life.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The life in<list>

                        <item>this world.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>The life in the wombe is a kind of impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment; there the child lives for a time. The life in this world, it is a kind of inlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but alas, it is as much inferiour to the blessed, and glorious life in heaven, as the life in the wombe is narrower, and straiter, and and more base then this life wherein wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the blessed light, and enjoy all the sweet comforts of this life. They are happy after death, then the Image of God is perfect in the soule, all graces are perfected, all wants supplied, all corruptions wrought out, all enemies subdued, all promises accomplished, waiting their time for the resurrection of the body, and then body and soule shall sit as Judges, upon the wretches that have judged them on earth, and they shall be both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>for ever with the Lord.</hi> I might enlarge the point much; it is a comfortable meditation. And before I passe it, let us make some use of it.</p>
                  <p>If godly men be blessed, and happy, not onely before death, in the right, and title they
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:17825:223"/>
have to heaven; but in death, because then the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> are invested into possession, of that, that makes them every way happy.</p>
                  <p>Therefore this may teach us who are truly wise. A wise man is he that hath a better end <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse.</hi> Who truly wise.</note> then another, and works to that end. A true Christian man, he hath a better end then any worldling, his end is to be safe in another world, and hee works and carries his forces to that end. <hi>Let my last end be like his,</hi> saith <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam:</hi> insinuating that there was a better end, inregard of condition, and state, then he had aymed at. A gracious man, his end is not to <note place="margin">Godly mans end, what.</note> be happy here; his end is to enjoy everlasting communion with God in the heavens, and hee frames all his courses in this world, to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish that end, and he is never satisfied in the things that make to that end. A worldling he hath no such end; he hath a naturall desire to be saved (as wee shall see afterwards) but a man may know that it is not his end: for hee workes not to it. He is not satisfied in prou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for this world, he is not weary of getting wealth, hee is not satisfied with pleasure: so that his end is the things of this life. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let him be never so wise, he is but a foole: for he hath not the true end, nor workes to it. Wicked men are very fooles, in the manner of their reasoning: for they will grant, that there is a happy estate of godly men in death, and after death better: if it be so, why doe they not worke, and frame their lives to it?
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:17825:224"/>
Herein they are fooles, because they grant one thing, and not another which must needs follow: they doe beleeve there is such a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse to Gods children, and yet seeke not after it.</p>
                  <p>If there be such a blessed estate of Gods children in death, and after death; I beseech <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 2. To labour to partake of this happinesse.</note> you let us carry our selves so, as that wee may be partakers of that happinesse; let us labour to be righteous men, labour to be in <hi>Christ,</hi> to have the righteousnesse of <hi>Christ</hi> to be ours, to be out of our selves in <hi>Christ,</hi> in <hi>Christ</hi> in life, in <hi>Christ</hi> in death, and at the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>Christ,</hi> not <hi>having our owne righteousnesse,</hi> (as the Apostle saith) <hi>but his righteousnesse,</hi> and then the righteousnesse of grace, and of a good conscience will alway goe with the other. For this makes a righteous man to be in <hi>Christ,</hi> and to have his righteousnesse, and <note place="margin">Righteous man, who.</note> to have his spirit, and the beginnings of the new creature in us. Let us labour to be such as may live and die happily, and blessedly, and be for ever happy. So much for that third point.</p>
                  <p>That which I intend mainly to dwell on is the last, and that is this, that,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Even a wicked man, a wretched worldling may see this, hee may know this happinesse of Gods</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">A wicked man may know the happy estate of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note> 
                     <hi>people, in death, and for ever, and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing may continue a cursed wretch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Balaam</hi> here wishes, <hi>Oh that I might die the death of the righteous, and that my last end might</hi>
                     <pb n="85" facs="tcp:17825:224"/>
                     <hi>be like his.</hi> It was a strange speech of such a man as this was, that his soule should be rapt up in this manner: but indeed <hi>Balaam</hi> was scarse himselfe, hee scarce understood what he said, no more then the beast that carryed him.</p>
                  <p>But God will sometimes, even stirre up the hearts of wicked men, to a sight and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of the excellent estate of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; why? For diverse reasons; Among the rest for this: that he may convince them the more of their owne rebellion, when they see <note place="margin">Reason 1. To justify God in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</note> a more excellent estate then they are in, if they will not take the course to partake of it: Therefore at the day of Judgement it will justifie the sentence of damnation upon such wretches, and they may pronounce selfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation upon themselves. Oh! what a terrour will it be when they shall thinke, I had a better estate discovered, I heard of it in the ministery of the Word, and Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit revealed an excellent estate, and I might have gotten it, if I had improoved the blessed meanes that God made me partaker of; and now I am shut out for ever, and ever from communion in that estate? To convince wretched men (I say) and to justifie the just sentence of damnation upon them, that their hearts may goe with the sentence at the day of Judgement, God thus enlightens them oftentimes, that they see better courses, if they had grace to take them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="86" facs="tcp:17825:225"/>
What a thing is this, that a wicked man should see such an estate, and not take it? And what serves that knowledge for, but to damne them, the more? This is the estate of many men that live in the bosome of the Church, and partake of the meanes of salvation, and yet live in sinnes against conscience; they get knowledge by the Ministery, and by good bookes, and acquaintance, and such like; they have a savour in the use of good things, something they have, some little apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the estate of a better life.</p>
                  <p>Againe, for another end, God reveales to <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reason</hi> 2. To restraine their malice.</note> them the excellent estate of his children some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, to keepe them in better order, to awe them, that they be not open enemies to the Church, but may doe good service; for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiting that there is such a happinesse, and that perhaps they may partake of it, they will not carry themselves malignantly against those that are true professors.</p>
                  <p>There are severall degrees of wicked men, <note place="margin">Degrees of wicked men.</note> some are well-willers to good things, though they never come farre enough. Some are open malicious persecutors. Some againe are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then so, they have a hatred to goodnesse, but they doe not openly shew themselves as hypocrites, &amp;c. God reveales these good things to wicked men, to keepe them in awe. The net drawes bad fish as well as good: so the net of the Word, it drawes wicked men, it keepes them from violence, and open malice:
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:17825:225"/>
besides, even the Majesty of the word, and the convinction of that excellente state that belongs to Gods Children, it keeps them from open malice and persecution. This is another end that God aymes at: what may we learn hence? <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse.</hi> Not to refuse all that ill men say.</note> Seeing this is so; it should teach us that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse not al that ill men say, they may have good aprehensions, &amp; give good counsel. It had bin good for <hi>Iosiah</hi> to have followed the counsell of wicked <hi>Pharaoh</hi> a heathen. God oft enlightens men, that otherwise are reprobates: refuse not Gold from a dirtie hand, do not refuse directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from wicked men, because they are soandso, refuse not a pardon from man, a base reature. We ought not therfore to have such respect of persons, as to refuse excellent things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the person is wicked. But that which I <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vse</hi> 2. To go beyond wicked men in our desires.</note> intend to presse is this. If this be so, that wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men may have illumination, whereby they discover an excellencie, and likewise may have desires raysed up, to wish and desire that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie. It should stir vs up to goe beyond wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men, shall we not goe so farre as those goe that shall never come to heaven? we see here <hi>Balaam</hi> pronounceth the end of the righteous to be happie. This should therfore stir us up to labor to be in a different estate from wicked men. Let vs therfore consider a little wherein the difference of these desires is, the desires that a <hi>Balaam</hi> may have, and the desires of a <note place="margin">Difference of desires in true Christians, &amp; others.</note> sound Christian; wherein the desires of a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man are failing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="88" facs="tcp:17825:226"/>
These desires first of all, they were but flashes: for we never read that he had them long, they <note place="margin">1 They are not<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap> constant.</note> were meere flashes; as a sudden light, that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther blinds a man then shewes him the way: so these enlightnings they are not constant. Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men oft times haue sudden motions, and flashes, and desires, oh! that I might die the death of the righteous, oh! that I were in such mans estate: but it is but a sudden flash, and lightning. They are like a torrent, a strong sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den streame, that comes suddenly and makes a noyse, but it hath no spring to feed it. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires of Gods Children they are fed with a spring, they are constant; they are streames, and not flashes.</p>
                  <p>Againe this desire of this wretched man, it <note place="margin">2 They are not from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note> was not from an inward principle, an inward tast that he had of the good estate of Gods Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: but from an obiectiue delight, and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of somewhat that was offered to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite by the holy-ghost at this time. It was not from any inward tast, and rellish in himselfe that he speakes, but from somewhat outward, as a man that saw, and heard excellent things, that ravished him with admiration, though he had not interest in them himselfe.</p>
                  <p>Againe in the third place, this desire of the happinesse of the estate of Gods children, it was not working and operative, but an uneffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall desire, it had only a complacency, and pleasing in the thing desired: but there was not a desire to worke any thing to that end. This
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:17825:226"/>
wretch therefore would bee at his journeys end, before he had set one step forward to the jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. It was a desire of the end without the meanes: It was not an operative effectuall, but a weake transient desire. Where true desires are, they are not only constant, and proceed from an inward interest, &amp; tastof the thing desired: but they are effectuall and operative, they set the soule and body, the whole man on worke, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to use the meanes to attaine the thing desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and partly to remove the impediments: for where desire is, there will be a removing of the impediments to the thing desired: as hee that intends a journey, hee will consider what may hinder him, and what may helpe him in it; he that sets not about these things, hee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver meanes it; for a man cannot come to his journeyes end with wishing: we can attain no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in this life with wishing. There is a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king (I say) that tends to remove impediments as farre as we may, and tending to use all means to effect and bring the thing to passe. We see then there is a maine difference betweene the desires of this wretched man <hi>Balaam,</hi> and the desires of the true Church of God. To goe on and follow the point a little further.</p>
                  <p>Where desires are in truth, the party that cherisheth those desires, will bee willing to have all helpe from others to have his desire ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished. If a man desire to demolish a place, if any will come and helpe him downe with it, or if any man desire to weed his ground
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:17825:227"/>
he that will helpe him, he will thanke him for his paines. Where there is a true desire, there is a willing closing with all that offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, that the thing desired may be brought to passe. Where there is a desire of the happy estate of Gods children, there will be a willing entertainment of any helpe. Let a man come to a man that desires grace, and glory, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his especiall sins that hinder him, you must weed out this, and you must pull downe this, he will thankfully imbrace all admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, because he truly desires the end, therefore hee desires the meanes that tend to the end, hee desires the remooving of the hindrances, hee will be thankefull therefore for any helpe that he may have, and especially that of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, that it may powerfully enter into his soul, and rip him up, why? because hee desires to please God in all things, and he would not che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish a motion, or desire, contrary to the spirit of God: therefore the more corruption is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented, and made odious to him: the more the inward man is discovered, the more hee blesseth God, and blesseth the blessed instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and of all meanes he is willing to attend upon such<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>Where there is swelling, and rising against the blessed meanes, either in private admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or publike teaching, let men pretend what they will, there is no true desire of grace, and to be in the estate of Gods people, for then they would not be contrary to the means.
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:17825:227"/>
This wretched man <hi>Balaam</hi> when the Angell stood in his way, with his sword drawne, to stoppe his way: yet notwithstanding he goes on still, he was so carryed with covetousnesse, and so blinded, that neither the miracle of the beast speaking, nor of the Angell in his way, nor God in the way could stoppe him; alas, where was this desire then? No, no, the glo ry of earthly things dazeled the glory of the estate of Gods people; therefore wee see hee goes against all meanes that was used to stop him in his journey.</p>
                  <p>If a man desire to be good, and to leave his sinnes, he will not stand against the meanes.</p>
                  <p>Have wee not many that stand against the Ministery of Gods Ministers, are Gods An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, they stand in the way, and tell people, if you live in this course you shall not inherite heaven; if you live in oppression, and base lusts, unlesse you be changed, you shall all pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish. They come to particular reproofes, and hold forth the sword of Gods Spirit; yet men breake through all and wreake their malice up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Gods Messengers. Is here a true desire when they are not willing to have the hinderan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces removed? when there is not respect of the meanes that should be used?</p>
                  <p>Againe true desires of grace, they are grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing desires: though they bee little in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning <note place="margin">5 They are not growing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires.</note> as springs are, yet as the springs grow, so doe the waters that come from them: so these desires, they grow more and more still:
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:17825:228"/>
They grow sometimes in Gods children, that they will have no stop, till they come to have their sull desire, to have perfect union and communion with God in heaven. The desires of a blessed soule, they are never satisfied, till it come to heaven. <hi>Let him kisse me with the kis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of his mouth,</hi> saith the Church: oh, let mee <note place="margin">Cant. 1.</note> have nearer communion with Christ. It de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires in the vord and sacraments to come nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer and closer to God, and in death then, <hi>Come Lord Iesus, come quickly.</hi> And when the soule is in heaven, there is yet nearer union, a desire of the bodies resurrection that both may be for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with the Lord. Till a Christian be perfect in body and soule, there is desire upon desire, till all desires be accomplished: they are grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing desires, as S. <hi>Peter</hi> saith, <hi>As new born babes desire the sincere milke of the word, that yee may grow thereby.</hi> It is a desire that is never satisfied, because there is alway somewhat to be desired till we be perfectly happy.</p>
                  <p>And then they are desires that will not bee stilled. A child, if it have not strong desires, it <note place="margin">6 They are not strong:</note> will be stilled with an apple: but if the desires be strong, nothing will still it but the dug: so Gods Children, if their desires be strong, it is no bauble they desire, nothing but grace and inward comfort will quiet the inward man. It is a desire that is growing, and strong, it will not be staid with any thing in this world, but wil break through all impediments, as a strong stream, it will never rest, till it have communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:17825:228"/>
with God. And therefore the desires that men think are good, and earnest enough, that goe on plodding in a constant course, and never labour to grow, they are no desires at all, no sanctified desires from a supernaturall princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of grace. The desires of a Christian grow, and are never satisfied till hee have perfect hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse.</p>
                  <p>The three worthies of David brake through the host, and got the water of <hi>Bethel</hi> for <hi>David, oh that I had of the water of Bethel.</hi> So where there are strong desires, they are like Davids wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies, they carry the soule through all impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments, they grow stronger and stronger, and are never satisfied till they come to the water of life. Let us consider these things, whether we have this desire or no: if we have but some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times flashes, inconstant, ineffectuall desires, desires that grow not, that are soone satisfied, and are stilled with any thing, alas, these desires the spirit of God never kindled, and bred in the heart, they are ordinary flashes, that shall serve for our deeper damnation. Therefore let us take heed, and not rest in a cast-awayes estate, let us not rest in <hi>Balaams</hi> state, but labour that the desires of our souls may be as they should.</p>
                  <p>Desires (I confesse) are the best character to know a Christian: for workes may be hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriticall, desires are naturall. Therefore wee <note place="margin">Desires, the best character of a christian.</note> ought to consider our desires, what they are, whether true or no: for the first thing that issues from the soul are desires &amp; thoghts, thoghts stir
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:17825:229"/>
up desires. This inward immediate stirring of of the soule, discovers the truth of the soule, better then outward things. Let us oft there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore examine our desires: And let me adde this one thing to the other: let us examine our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires <note place="margin">7 They desire happines, not holinesse.</note> by this, besides the rest, whether we desire holinesse, and the restauration of the Image of God, the new creature, and to have victory a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst our corruptions, to be in a state that we may not sinne against God, to have the spirit, to be new born, as well as we desire happinesse, and exemption from misery. Balaam desired happinesse, but hee desired not the Image of God upon his Soule, for then he would not have bin carried with a covetous divell against all meanes. No, his desire was after a glympse of Gods childrens glory only.</p>
                  <p>A wicked man can never desire to be in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as he should be: for how should we desire to <note place="margin">Wicked men desire not heaven aright.</note> be in heaven? to be freed from sinne, that wee may praise God, and love God, that there may be no combate betweene the flesh and the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Can he wish this? No, his happinesse is as a swine to wallow in the mire, and he desires to enjoy sensible delights: as for spirituall things, especially the Image of God, and the vision of God, they are not fit objects for him, as farre as it is a freedome from sin, but as hee hath a conceit, oh, there are goodly things to be seene, &amp;c. So it corresponds with his dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, but to bee free from Sin, and from the conflict of the flesh and spirit, and to be set at
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:17825:229"/>
liberty to serve God alway, he cannot desire it so. Tell him of heaven, he loves it not, there is no gold, there is not that, that he affects, therfore he cares not for it, he cannot relish it, he is not changed. Therefore it is a notable Character of a true Christian to desire heaven, to be freed from sinne, to have communion with God in holinesse, other prerogatives will follow this.</p>
                  <p>Let us therefore consider what our desires are, how they are carryed: for desires discover what the soule is. As a spring is discovered by <note place="margin">Simile.</note> the vapours that are about it; so is this hidden state of the soule, discovered by the breaking out of desires. They are the breath, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour of the soule. Let us consider what is set highest in our soules, what we desire most of all. Oh! a Christian soule that hath <hi>tasted of the loving kindnesse of the Lord,</hi> accounts <hi>it better then life</hi> it selfe. It is not <hi>Corne, and wine, and oyle</hi> he desires, <hi>but Lord shew me the light of thy countenance.</hi> The desires of his heart are large to serve God, and to doe good, more then for the things of the world. He desires earthly things, but as instruments for better things; and this is the desire of every sanctified soule in some measure.</p>
                  <p>Let us hence make a use of convinction of <note place="margin">Conviction of such as come short of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam.</note> the folly of base men, that live in the Church, and yet come not so farre as <hi>Balaam,</hi> that come not so farre as those that shall goe to hell. They turne over all Religion, to a <hi>Lord have</hi>
                     <pb n="96" facs="tcp:17825:230"/>
                     <hi>mercy upon us,</hi> and <hi>Christ dyed for us,</hi> and we hope we have soules to God ward, as good as the best, and to a few short broken things. They turne Religion to compendiums, to a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row compasse, and make the vvay to it wide, and broad, and complaine of Preachers, that they straiten the way to heaven.</p>
                  <p>This is the disposition of worldlings; whereas alas, there must be a righteousnesse that must <hi>exceed the righteousnesse of the Scribes and Pharises:</hi> there must be a righteousnesse from an inward principle, there must be a strong, constant desire of righteousnesse more then of any thing in the world, before we can be assured of our interest, and part with Gods people. Let us take heed, that we delude not our selves this way.</p>
                  <p>But to come to an use of direction. How <note place="margin">Directionshow to have holy desires,</note> may we so carry our selves, as we may have a spring of blessed desires, a spring of holy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, that may comfort us, that we may have our interest, and portion in the state of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? <note place="margin">1 Beg the spirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of revelation.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>That we may have these desires, let us de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of God the spirit of revelation; desires follow discovery: for desires are the vent of the soule upon the discovery of some excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency it beleeves. Therefore let us beg of God, the spirit of revelation, to discover the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent estate of Gods people. And because this is given in the use of meanes; let us present our selves with all diligence under such means,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:17825:230"/>
as where we may have somewhat of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, that the riches of <hi>Christ</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unfolded; our desires may be carryed to such things; for there is never any discovery of holy, and good, and gracious things to a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian soule, but there are new desires stirred up. Our soules are like a mill that grinds <note place="margin">Simile.</note> what is put into it: so the soule it workes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the things that are put into it, if it have good desires, and good thoughts put into it by good meanes used, and by prayer, it feeds upon them: let us alway therefore be under some good meanes, that good thoughts may be ministred unto us, that may stirre up gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious desires for the soule to worke upon. Let us be in good company. <hi>Saul among the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi> we see hee prophesied: and the heart is kindled and enflamed, when we are among those that are better then our selves, especially if their hearts be inlarged to speake of good things: but to come nearer.</p>
                  <p>That we may have holy, and gracious, and <note place="margin">See what hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires.</note> constant desires, let us take notice and make tryall continually of the state and frame of our soules, which way for the present they are carryed, in what current our desires run. If they runne the right way, to heavenly things, it is well, if not, take notice what drawes, and diverts, and turnes the streames of our desires the false way: let us thinke what the things be, and the condition of those things that drawes our desires downe, and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:17825:231"/>
make us earthly and worldly, whether the pleasures, or profits or honours of this life. The way to have better desires is, to weane our selves from these things, by a constant, holy meditation of the vanity of these things, that the soule is carryed after. <hi>Salomon</hi> to weane his heart from these desires, from pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing too much happinesse in these things, he sets them before him, and saith, they were va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and vexation of spirit. Let us set them before us, as nothing, as they will be ere long, <hi>Heaven and earth will passe away,</hi> the world will passe away, and the concupiscence, and lust of it. Let us consider the basenesse, ficklenes and uncertainety of things that our soules are carryed after, and this will be a meanes to weane them from them. And the soule being weaned from earthly things, it will run amaine another way. Let us study therefore to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie our base affections, and study it to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, to cut off the right hand, and to pull out the right eye, spare nothing, that God may spare all; that God may have mercy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, and spare us, let us spare nothing. These lusts <hi>they fight against our soules.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as I said before, feed our soules, mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster unto them better thoughts continually. Those that are governours of those that are yong, season them while they be yong with good things; for while the soule is not filled with the world, and while covetousnesse and ill lusts have not wrought themselves into the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:17825:231"/>
soule, good things, and good desires, are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily rooted, and planted, and grow up in the soule. As letters graven in the body of a tree, they grow up with the tree; and the fruit of the tree growes up with the tree, and therefore the twigs breake not with the greatnesse of the weight of it, because they grow up toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: so plant good things in those that are yong, inure them to know good things, to hate ill wayes; plant in them blessed desires, and inure them to holy exercises and good duties, that good exercises may grow up with them, as the fruit wth the tree. We see what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> hard matter it is to convert an old man, to draw the desires of a carnall worldly man to heaven: when we speak of good things to him, his soule is full of the world: what is in his brain? the world: what is in his heart? the world. So he is dry and exhausted of all good things, and that that is in him, is eaten up with the world. It is a great improvidence in those that governe youth, that they labour not, that their desires may be strong to the best things.</p>
                  <p>And let us all, both young and old, labour <note place="margin">To <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

If we have a motion stirring us up to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:17825:232"/>
let us ripen it till it come to perfect repentance, till we repent indeed, and have turned from all our evill wayes, and turne to God, with full purpose of heart, that it may be a motion to purpose. If it be a motion to faith, let us never leave cherishing of it by the promise, till our hearts be <hi>rooted in faith.</hi> If it be a motion to any other good thing, let us cherish and follow them to purpose. And im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace every motion, as an Angell sent from heaven, from God to a good end, to put us in mind, to invite us to good, and to drive us from ill.</p>
                  <p>And because desires are fickle and fading of themselves, unlesse there be some art in helping of them: therefore let us adde to these things a daily course of renewing of our cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants <note place="margin">To renewe our cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants.</note> with God, that this day as God shall enable, me, I have a constant purpose against all sinne; I will regard no iniquity in my heart, I will have respect to all good wayes discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Renew our covenants, and resolutions of old, saith <hi>David, I have sw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>What needs all this adoe saith the wicked athiest, will not lesse serve the turne, but there <note place="margin">Question.</note> must be these vowes, and purposes, and reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions?</p>

purposes, and not by uneffectuall glances, and wishes, will wishing helpe us take a journey, or to doe any thing in this world? and can we not doe any thing in this world with wishing, and can wee for heaven? No, certainly there must be resolutions, and covenants, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses, &amp;c. What is the difference betweene a Christian and another man? A Christian un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looseth his heart from base desires, nothing shall tie him to the base world; but his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science tells him, that he is free from living in sinnes against conscience, and as for infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, he labours, and resolves against them: therefore he is fit to die, and to resigne his soule. Whensoever God shall take him, hee is in a good way, in good purposes, and reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions. God values us according to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses, and resolutions. <hi>David</hi> did not build the Temple; <hi>Abraham</hi> did not offer <hi>Isaack,</hi> but they resolved upon it, and it was accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as done. This is our comfort, that God takes the resolution for the deed, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of a Christian is, that God accepts of these resolutions, when hee determines on the best things, till he bring his heart in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to that estate.</p>
                  <p>What is the reason that many men at the <note place="margin">Quest.</note> houre of death will admit no comfort?</p>
                  <p>The reason is, their hearts were naught, they <note place="margin">

                  <p>But to answer an ordinary let, or two, that the Devill casts in mens wayes, in these things: But doth not God accept <hi>the will for the deed?</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Objection.</note> put the case I have a good will to doe a thing, though I doe it not God accepts that.</p>

                     </gap>le to be remooved: as, put the case a poore man would be liberall if he had it, God accepts the will for the deed, because he wants opportunity. But it never holds when a man can doe it, God accepts not the will for the deed, when a man hath a price in his hand to get wisdome, and yet is a barren plant, and not a tree of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; it is a signe of a naughty heart.</p>
                  <p>Oh! saith another, <hi>God quencheth not the smoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king</hi>

                  <p>It is true, God doth not quench the smoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Answer.</hi> God leaves not good desires.</note> flax, but he doth not leave it smoaking, but blowes the sparke that in time it comes to a flame: where there are beginnings of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse imbraced, it will grow from smoaking flax to a flame: they are growing desires as I said before. Therefore flatter not thy selfe, that <hi>Christ</hi> will not quench the smoaking flax. It is true, if there be a desire of growth: for then I must speake comfort to a poore Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, that cannot be so good as he would, but
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:17825:233"/>
desires it, and complaines, oh, <hi>that my wayes were so direct, that I might keepe thy statutes!</hi> with his desires, he complaines that he cannot do it, and useth the meanes to grow, it is a good signe God will not quench the smoaking Flax, till he have brought corruption into subjection in us. Let every good soule comfort it selfe with this, if thou have these blessed desires, God meets with thee: for he desires thy salvation, and Christ desires thy reconciliation, and it is the desire of thy heart, and thou usest the meanes, thou wilt not live in sins against con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, be of good comfort, wee that are the ministers of God, and I at this time bring the newes of pardon, Christs desire and thine meet in one.</p>
                  <p>Let us enlarge these things in our own deep and serious meditation. Alas, for want of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious meditation in our hearts of such like truthes as these, men perish, and sinke sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to hell. There is but a steppe betweene or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary prophane persons, and hell, and yet they never thinke of renewing their covenants with God, and entring into the state of grace, but content themselves with that, which comes short of thousands that are now in hell, that have had more wishes and desires. Men put all upon empty things, God is mercifull, &amp;c. No, God will not be mercifull to such as blesse themselves in ill courses, his wrath shall smoak against such, as I said, for in thus reasoning, they make a covenant with hell and death, as
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:17825:234"/>
much as they can. They that doe thus, forget God and good courses, and God will forget them, they treasure up wrath, and God trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures up wrath against them. Let us take heed of <hi>Balaams</hi> wishing, and labour to have such desires, as may bee accepted of God, and comfortable to us.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>OD having framed man an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing creature, hath made him fit to have communion and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course with himselfe, because hee can by his understanding discerne, that there is a better good out of himselfe, in communion and fellowship with which, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse consists: other creatures, wanting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding to discerne a better good out of, then in themselves, their life being their good, desire only the continuance of their owne bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:17825:236"/>
without society and fellowship with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. But man, having the knowledge of God, the Creator of heaven and earth, but especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of God the Redeemer, providing for him a second beeing, better then his first; understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth that his best and chiefest good dependeth more in him, then in himselfe, and because his happinesse standeth in acquaintance and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship with this God, which is the chiefe good, he desireth a communion with him, that he may partake of his good.</p>
                  <p>This communion and fellowship of man with God, was first founded on a Covenant of workes made with Adam in Paradise, if he did obey, and did not eat of the forbidden fruit, he should have life, both for himselfe and his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity; the which Covenant, because God would not have forgotten, hee afterward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed in the delivery of the ten Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, requiring from man obedience to them in his owne person, exactly at all times, perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, promising life on the obedience, and threatning death, and cursing, if hee continued not in every thing the law required to doe: But this fellowship being placed in mans owne freedome, and having so weake a foundation, he lost both himselfe and it, so that now by the first Covenant of workes, <hi>Adam</hi> and all his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity are under a curse, for we cannot fulfill the law, that requireth personall obedience, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect obedience, and exact obedience, hee that continueth not in all is cursed. The Law then
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:17825:236"/>
findeth us dead, and killeth us, it findeth us dead before, and not onely leaves us dead still, but makes us more dead.</p>
                  <p>Now after this fall, mans happinesse was, to recover againe his communion and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with God, and therefore we must have a new Covenant, before wee can have life and comfort, God must enter into new conditions with us before wee can have any communion with him.</p>
                  <p>God therefore, loving man, doth after the breach of the first agreement and Covenant, when <hi>Adam</hi> had lost himselfe by his sinne, and was in a most miserable plight as ever creature was in the world, falling from so great a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse into wondrous misery: hee raysed him up, and comforted him, by establishing a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, a new and better Covenant, laying the foundation of it, in the blessed seed of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, <hi>Christ,</hi> the <hi>Messiah,</hi> who is the ground of this new Covenant, and so of our commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and fellowship with God, without whom there can be no intercourse betweene God and us in love; and because this Covenant vvas almost forgotten, therefore now in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> time God renewed it to <hi>Abraham</hi> in this place, <hi>I will be thy God, and the God of thy seed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thee, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are foure periods of time, of renevy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Covenant: first, from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and in those first times of the vvorld, those that were under the Covenant, vvere
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:17825:237"/>
called the sonnes and daughters of God, the children of the promise, and the covenant of grace was called a promise of the blessed seed.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, from <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Moses,</hi> and then it was called a covenant, and they the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the covenant: <hi>I will establish my Covenant.</hi> A covenant is more then a promise, and a more solemne thing, because there be Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</p>
                  <p>The third period of renewing the covenant of grace was from <hi>Moses</hi> to <hi>Christ,</hi> and then it was more cleare, when as to the covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> who was sealed with the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Circumcision, the Sacrament of the Pascall Lambe was added, and all the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices Leviticall, and then it was called a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament; that differeth a little from a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: for a Testament is established by blood, it is established by death: so was that, but it was onely with the blood and death of Cattle sacrificed as a Type.</p>
                  <p>But now to <hi>Christs</hi> time to the end of the world, the covenant of grace is most cleare of all, and it is now usually called the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, being established by the death of <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe: and it differs from a Covenant in these respects.</p>
                  <p>First, a Testament indeed is a covenant, but something more, it is a covenant sealed by death, the Testator must die before it can be of force: so all the good that is conveyed to
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:17825:237"/>
us by the Testament, it is by the death of the Testator <hi>Christ:</hi> Gods covenant with us now, is such a covenant as is a Testament, sealed with the death of the Testatour <hi>Christ,</hi> for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blood there is no redemption, without the death of <hi>Christ</hi> there could be no satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and without satisfaction there could be no peace with God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, a Testament bequeatheth good things meerely of love, it giveth gifts freely. A covenant requireth some thing to be done, in a Testament there is nothing but receiving the Legacies given. In covenants ofttimes, it is for the mutuall good one of another, but a Testament is meerely for their good, for whom the Testament is made, to whom the Legacies are bequeathed, for when they are dead, what can they receive from them? Gods Covenant now is such a Testament, sealed with the death of <hi>Christ,</hi> made out of love, meerely for our good, for what can God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of us? all is legacies from him, and though hee requireth conditions, requireth faith and obedience, yet he himselfe fulfilleth what he asketh, giveth what he requireth, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth it as a Legacie, as we shall see afterward.</p>
                  <p>Thus you see that the communion and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship of man with God, must either be by a covenant of workes, or by a covenant of grace. And we must distinguish exactly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene these two covenants, and the periods of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="112" facs="tcp:17825:238"/>
When the covenant of workes was disanu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by ours sinnes, because we could not fulfill the Law exactly, and perpetually, God will have a new Covenant, if wee beleeve in <hi>Christ,</hi> we shall have everlasting life. Now if wee sticke to the one, we must renounce the other, if it be of faith, it is not of workes, and if it be of workes, it is not of faith. This was excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently signified by <hi>Ioshua</hi> and <hi>Moses. Ioshua</hi> bringeth the people to Canaan and not <hi>Moses, Moses</hi> doth not bring any to heaven, it must be <hi>Ioshua,</hi> the Type of the true Jesus, that must bring them <hi>through Iordan to Canaan.</hi> This was typified also in the Arke: there was the Law, the Covenant of workes in the Arke, but the propitiatory, the Mercy-seate was above the Arke, above the Law, and from thence, God made all his Answers, to signifie to us, that we can have nothing to doe with the Law with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Propitiatory: <hi>Christ</hi> is the Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, the Mercy-seate; in <hi>Christ</hi> God heareth us, he makes all his Answers in the Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, <hi>Christ.</hi> Therefore when the question is of salvation, how wee have title to heaven; Not by the merit of workes, for then we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse the Covenant of grace, but our title is meerely by Gods mercy in <hi>Christ</hi> apprehended by faith. The evidence indeed to prove our faith to be a true faith, is from workes, but the title we have is onely by <hi>Christ,</hi> onely by grace. Here we must appeale from <hi>Sinai</hi> to <hi>Sion:</hi> from the Law to the Gospell, from <hi>Moses</hi> to <hi>Christ;</hi>
                     <pb n="113" facs="tcp:17825:238"/>
we must flie with <hi>Ioab</hi> to the homes of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, that must be our refuge; flie to <hi>Christ</hi> in the Covenant of grace, and wee shall not be pulled from thence as <hi>Ioab</hi> was from the Altar, there let us live and die.</p>
                  <p>Remember (I say) that the Covenant of grace is distinct in the whole kind, from the Covenant of workes, yet this; They are both in the Church, and both taught one subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to the other: As thus. The Covenant of workes is taught to shew us our failing, that seeing our owne disability to performe what the Law requireth we may be forced to the new Covenant of grace: And therefore saith <note place="margin">Gal. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>Paul, By the Law I am dead to the Law.</hi> It is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent speech, by the <hi>Law I am dead to the Law,</hi> by the Covenant of workes I am dead to the Covenant of workes: that is by the Lawes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>acting of me exact and perpetuall obedience, in thought word and deed, I come to see that I cannot fulfill it, and therefore am dead to the Law, that is, I looke for no salvation, for no title to heaven by that, and therefore he saith, the Law was added for transgression: why was the Law added to the promise of salvation by <hi>Christ</hi> made here to <hi>Abraham,</hi> why was the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of workes added in the wildernes after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards? it was for transgression, to increase the sense of transgression: that wee by the Law might see what we should doe, and what we have not done, and that we are by that come under a curse, and so might flie to the promise
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:17825:239"/>
of grace in <hi>Christ.</hi> I have stood the longer in the clearing of this, because it is a maine point.</p>
                  <p>But to come to that which I specially intend, the words (as I said before) containe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of this blessed and gracious agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, betweene God and man, to <hi>Abraham</hi> the father of the faithfull.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I will establish my Covenant betweene me and thee, and thy seed after thee in their Generations, for an everlasting Covenant, to be thy God, and the God of thy seed after thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The words (you see) containe a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: and here are all things, all the Articles and circumstances that agree to any Covenant whatsoever.</p>
                  <p>Here are the parties, both that makes the Covenant, and that are covenanted with.</p>
                  <p>Here is the substance of the Covenant, and the qualities of the Covenant, and the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Covenant.</p>
                  <p>The party making the Covenant, is God; <hi>I will be thy God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>God is the party covenanting: God indeed is both the party covenanting, and the substance of the Covenant, <hi>I will be a God to thee,</hi> they fall both together in one. It is a most sweet signe of Gods great love, that he will stoope so low, as to make a Covenant with us, to be our God, to be himselfe all in all to us. For consider but both these parties, God and we, the Creator and the creature, the immortall
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:17825:239"/>
God and mortall man, the glorious God, and dust and afhes, the holy God, and sinfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, the great King of heaven and earth, and Rebels and traytours as wee are. For him to condescend so low, as to make a Covenant with us, to enter into Termes and Articles of agreement with us, it is a wondrous signe of his gracious mercy and love; what can we but hope for from so gracious a God? But I shall have occasion to touch that afterward.</p>
                  <p>The parties covenanted with, are <hi>Abraham</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>d his seed, his seede by promise.</p>
                  <p>The substance of the Covenant is, <hi>I will be a God to thee, and to thy seed after thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The qualities of the Covenant are, first, it is a sure Covenant, <hi>I will establish my Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is an <hi>everlasting Covenant, I will establish my Covenant for an everlasting Covenant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is a peculiar Covenant, <hi>I will establish my Covenant betweene me and thee, and thy seed:</hi> that is, onely betweene me and thee and thy seed, not with the refuse of the world, but onely with thy seed by promise, onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, whether <hi>Iewes</hi> or <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, it is a most free Covenant: it was made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> whom God called out of <hi>Vr,</hi> of the Chaldees, out of an idolatrous nation, out of an idolatrous family. Even as it was at the first most freely made to <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradise, when he was in a most desperate estate, when he was as low as hell in a manner, ready to
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:17825:240"/>
sinke into de spaire, then the <hi>Seede of the woman</hi> was promised; so here it was freely made to good <hi>Abraham.</hi> First, the love of God was free to him, when he call'd him being an ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latour, and then it was freely renewed after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward when hee was good, as wee shall see anon.</p>
                  <p>And lastly, It is a Covenant consisting most of spirituall things, it is a spirituall co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, I meane especially, promising spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall favours, although the other things as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendices of the maine are likewise meant: For after that the covenant was made to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his posterity, they endured many afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: after the promise was renewed to <hi>Iacob,</hi> wee know hee fled from his brother <hi>Esau</hi> to whom the Covenant of grace was not made, and yet of <hi>Esau</hi> presently came Duke such a one, and Duke such a one, and poore <hi>Iacob</hi> was faine to flie for his life in regard of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise. So that I say, it must be specially of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall blessings.</p>
                  <p>These are the qualities of the Covenant, It is a sure, an everlasting, a peculiar, and a most free Covenant, ayming specially at spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall things.</p>
                  <p>And then lastly, you have the condition of the Covenant, and that, though it is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest, yet it is implyed: <hi>I will be thy God, and the God of thy seede,</hi> therefore thou shalt take me for thy God, carry thy selfe to me as to thy God, &amp;c. It is usuall in other places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:17825:240"/>
where mention is made of this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, to imply the condition required on our parts, sometimes both the Covenant and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition are mentioned together, as in <hi>Zach.</hi> 13. <note place="margin">Zach. 13.</note> last: <hi>I will say (saith God) It is my people, and they shall say, the Lord is my God,</hi> the one springeth from the other; when God is a God to any, he makes the heart to answer; thou shalt be my God, and I will be thine alwayes. This is the condition on our part, that we make with God in this Covenant, to take him for our God, to be his people, and his pecuilar ones.
<q>I will be thy God, and the God of thy seed.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though these words, <hi>I will be a God to thee, and to thy seed,</hi> be the last words of the Text, yet being the substance of the Covenant, I thinke it shall be best to speake of that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I speake of the qualities of the Covenant, or any thing else.
<q>I will be thy God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the Covenant in the Messiah: but first, what is it to be a God?</p>
                  <p>I answer: To be a God, take it in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, is to give being to the creature that had no being of it selfe, and to protect and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the creature in its being, in a word, to be a Creatour; for providence is the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity and continuance of creation; this is to be a God. The office of God, as God, is a most glorious function: to be a King is a great
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:17825:241"/>
matter, but to be a God, to give being to the creature, to support it when it hath a being, to doe all that God should doe, this is a most glorious worke: but this is but creation, this is not intended especially here, for thus hee is the God of all his workes; thus by creation and preservation, he is the God of all the men in the world out of the Church.</p>
                  <p>What is then to be thy God? <hi>I will be thy God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I Answer, to be a God in a more peculiar manner, is to be a God in Covenant, that is, not onely to be a God to preserve and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue this being of ours in a civill life, but it is to be a God in a higher relation to us, to be a God in a reference to an eternall, supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall estate in heaven, to be a God here in grace, and hereafter in glory: and thus God is a God in a gracious covenant onely by <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ,</hi> and to those that beleeve in him. <hi>I will be thy God:</hi> that is, <hi>I will be thy God in Christ,</hi> to give thee a better being then this world can aford, to free thee from the cursed estate thou art in by nature, to deliver thee from all ill, spiritually and eternally, especially to bestow on thee all good, spiritually, and eternally, especially as wee have it in the words of the Covenant <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 1. <hi>I will be thy shield and thy</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Gen 15. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>exceeding great reward,</hi> a shield to keepe off all ill, and a reward for all good. So in the 84. <hi>God will be a Sun and a shield,</hi> &amp;c. a Sun <hi>Psal.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 84.</note> for all sweet comfort and good, and a shield,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:17825:241"/>
in regard of defence from ill; a Sunne and a shield, till wee come to the possession of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall happinesse. This is to be a God in a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar manner, to give all things necessary for grace and life too, for this life and for a better; to doe all things requisite to bring us to heaven and happinesse through <hi>Christ,</hi> in whom all the promises are, yea and <hi>Amen,</hi> to be all in all, to direct the protections and provions of this life, of our estate here to a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall happinesse hereafter, to a state beyond nature: for God directs the favours of this life, so that he takes them away or hee giveth them, as he seeth them advantageous or hinderances to a better estate. So is God a God to those that are in convenant with him, to doe all this, and to doe all this in opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all enemies whatsoever, to doe all this in weakenes and in the impotency of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to doe all this when all second causes are contrary as it were, to bring a man to heaven in spite of the Devill, &amp; of our owne corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or all oppositions whatsoever. This is to be a God indeed.</p>
                  <p>But why doth he say onely, <hi>I will be thy God;</hi> why doth he not say, I will give thee grace and protection, I will give thee heaven and life everlasting?</p>
                  <p>Because all is one: for all things in the world are in this one promise <hi>I will be thy God.</hi> See the wisedome of heaven, how much he speakes in how little, there cannot be more spoken then
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:17825:242"/>
thus, <hi>I will be thy God,</hi> for in saying, I will be thy God, he implies that, whatsoever he is, or hath, or can doe, shall be thine too, <hi>I will be thy God,</hi> that is, my wisedome shall be thine to watch over thee, to find out wayes to doe thee good, my power shall be thine to keepe thee from danger, to defend and rescue thee from all enemies, and to subdue them by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees unto thee: my providence shall be thine to turne all things to thy good: my mercy shall be thine, to forgive thy sins: my love shall be thine, to bestow on thee all necessary comforts; there is no phrase in the Scripture that hath so much in so little as this here, <hi>I will be thy God,</hi> if wee could unfold and lay open this excellent promise, all other particular promises in the covenant of grace are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of this: what is the reason (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith) all things are yours, because you are <hi>Christs,</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> is Gods, God is the God of <hi>Christ</hi> and our God, wee are in covenant with the God of <hi>Christ, Christ</hi> is the heire of all, and we are members of <hi>Christ:</hi> God who is the God of all things is ours. It is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous comprehensive promise.
<q>I will be thy God, and the God of thy seed.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The substance of thy Covenant then is, that God will be a God to us; the point to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served is this, <hi>That God graciously in the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed seed, the Messiah, Christ Iesus, he takes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>pon</hi>
                     <pb n="121" facs="tcp:17825:242"/>
                     <hi>him to be a God to all those that are in Covenant with him;</hi> that is, to be All-sufficient to bring us to happinesse, All-sufficient in this world, and in the world to come, to be our portion, to be all in all.</p>
                  <p>This is the first and fundamentall promise of all other, indeed it is the life and soule of all the promises, and it is the life and soule of all comfort whatsoever: for all other rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions spoken of God tend to this, that hee is <hi>our God,</hi> this is before to be a Father, before to be any thing. God first is a God, and then a Father, and then all in all to us. As he is first, the God of <hi>Christ,</hi> and then the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Christ,</hi> as you have it usually in the beginnings of the Epistles, <hi>God the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> first the God, and then the Father: to be a God then, is the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall and principall favour, from thence commeth our Election, his chusing of us to eternall salvation before all time, his prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and preservation of us in time, unto hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                  <p>I shall not need to speake more of this, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving unfolded it before.</p>
                  <p>But you will say, how shall we know, that this Covenant belongeth to us, that wee are such as we may say, God is our God?</p>
                  <p>I answer, first, to lay this for a ground, you must know, that to be a God, is a relation: whosoever God is a God to, he perswadeth them by his Spirit, that hee is a God to: the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:17825:243"/>
same Spirit that perswadeth them, that there is a God, that Spirit telleth them that, God is their God, and works a qualification and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposition in them, as that they may know, that they are in covenant with such a gracious God, the Spirit as it revealeth to them the love of God, and that he is theirs, so the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit enableth them to claime him for their God, to give up themselves to him, as to their God.</p>
                  <p>And the Spirit doth this, because friends cannot be in convenant and confederate with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out there be a likenesse, or an agreement: there must be more word: then on to a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, though Gods grace doe all, yet wee must give our consent, and therefore the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venat is exprest under the title of marriage, in marriage there must be a consent of both parties: In reconciliation betweene a King and subjects, that are fallen out when they are Rebels, there must be an accepting of the pardon, and a promise of new subjection. So then if God be our God, there will bee grace given to take him for our God, to give him homage as a King, to give him our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent as to our Spouse; thou shalt be my God and I will cleave to thee, as to my Lord and Husband: Can two walke together (saith the Prophet) and not be friends? there can bee no friendship with God, except there be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what wrought in us by his Spirit, to make us fit for friendship, that we may looke on
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:17825:243"/>
him as an object of love and delight: if wee looke on him as an object of hatred, what termes of friendship can there be? Now, that we may looke on him as an object of love, fit for converse with him, hee must make us such by consent, and yeelding to him, by framing the inward man to his, likenesse that so there may a peace be maintained with him: you see the ground of it, of necessity it must be so.</p>
                  <p>Well, to come to the tryalls, but let me first adde this to the former; whomsoever God is a God to, it is knowne, specially by spirituall and eternall favours: a man cannot know certainely that God is his God by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and common things, that cast-awayes may have; for a cast-away may have <hi>Ishmaels</hi> blessing, and <hi>Esaus</hi> portion, blessings of the left hand, common graces. To know undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly therefore, that God is our God, must be by peculiar matters; for those whose God, God is, are a peculiar people, a holy nation, severed from others. First of all then know, what the Spirit of God saith to thy soule, for they that are Gods have his Spirit, to reveale to their spirits, the secret and hidden love of God; but if the voyce of the Spirit be silent in regard of testimony, goe to the worke of the Spirit, but goe to the peculiar worke of the Spirit. For though the Spirit may be silent in regard of his testimony, yet there are some workes or other of the Spirit in a man,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:17825:244"/>
whereby hee may know that God is his God. As the Spirit of God workes in some sort, a proportion in him unto God; and none can know better what God is to him, then by sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of his owne heart, what hee is backe againe to God; for as God saith to him by his Spirit, thou art mine, so they say to God, thou art mine. Let us then come to the try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, by our carrying our selves to God. Can we say with <hi>David, Whom have I in heaven but thee,</hi> or <hi>what is there in earth in comparison of thee?</hi> when the conscience can tell us, that we make God our treasure and our portion above all earthly things, then wee make him our God. A Christian singleth our God, above all things in the world, for his happinesse. Lord, thou art mine, whatsoever wealth is mine, or riches mine, or friends mine, I stand not upon that, but thou art mine. A rich man runneth to his wealth, and make flesh his arme, he runneth to friends, to beare him out in ill causes, but a true Christian that hath God for his God, he may know it by this, he singleth out God for his portion, runnes to him in all extremities; Lord, thou art mine: this is a signe that God hath said to his soule, first, <hi>I am thy salvation.</hi> How can the soule appropriate God to himselfe? how can he say as <hi>Thomas</hi> did, <hi>My Lord and my God?</hi> except the Lord have spoken peace to the soule be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and have said, <hi>I am thy salvation?</hi> It is a signe we have made God our God, when wee

                  <p>Examine what affections wee have to God: (for it is affection, that makes a Christian) single out some few that we are most offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in. As first, for feare, it may shame us all, (indeed a Christian upon his best reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions is better) but the ordinary carriage of men is, they feare men more then God, they feare every thing more then him that they should feare above all. For instance, is the retyred carriage of men to God, such as their carryage is to the eye of the world? will not they doe that in secret ofttimes, that they will not doe openly? in secret they will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit this or that sinne, and thinke, who seeth? there are secret abominations in the closet of their hearts, they will not feare to doe that in the eye of God, that they feare to doe in the eye of a child of sixe yeares old, that is of any discretion: Is this to make God our God, when wee feare the eye of a silly mortall crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture more then the eye of God, that is tenne thousand times brighter then the Sunne, that
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:17825:245"/>
is our Judge, is God our God the whiles? undoubtedly, when God is made our God, there is an awe of the eye of heaven upon a man in all places, therefore this is the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Covenant, <hi>Walke before mee,</hi> or <hi>walke as in my sight;</hi> how doe wee walke before God as in his sight, when there is such a great deale of difference in our carriage secretly, and before the eyes of men? when wee labour more to approve our carriage to men, then we make conscience of our spirits to God? This may shame us, even the best of us who are in Covenant with God, and have made God our God, we have cause to be abased for this: and surely one of the best wayes to make Gods children abased and humbled, is to compare the different proportion of their carriage, how they carry themselves to men, whom they respect, and to outward things in the world, and how they carry themselves to God: if God be our God, there will be an universall feare and care to please God in all times and in all places, because hee is every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, darkenesse and light are all one to him.</p>
                  <p>Trie your selves therefore by this affection: if we make God our God, wee will feare him above all; for there being such a distance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene God and us, He the mighty God, and we creatures whose breath is in our nostrils, there can no other way be a Govenant of peace betwixt us, but with much reverence: therfore
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:17825:245"/>
all Christians are reverent creatures, they doe all in feare, they passe <hi>the whole time of their conversation here in feare, they make an end of their salvation with fear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap> and trembling,</hi> they enjoy their liberties in feare. Saint <hi>Iude</hi> makes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a number of wretched people in his time, that eate without feare: you may know a man that hath not this grace of God in his heart, by his unreverent carriage, hee never thinkes of the presence and All-seeing eye of God. A Christian that hath God to his God, knowes that wheresoever hee is, hee is in the eye of heaven, therefore he is jealous, even of his owne most secret corruptions, he knowes that they are lawlesse of themselves, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he alwayes sets himselfe in the presence of God, he is full of reverence, full of feare, even in the enjoying of his Christian liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
                  <p>So likewise for the affection of love: if God be thy God, thou hast grace given thee to love him above all things; with whom God is graciously reconciled, he giveth them his Spirit to be reconciled backe againe to him, He loveth us, and we love him againe: for wee are by nature enemies to God, as hee is to us, there is no wicked man in the world can love God; indeed as God is a God, that promiseth salvation he loveth him, hee would faine have that, and therefore would faine be in his favour, but hee cannot love God as he is in all respects, but he hateth him, and hee ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth

his children, hee trifleth with his name by oaths and blasphemy, and the like, hee scorned God, hee wisheth that there were no God; can this man say, that God is his God, when he doth not carry himselfe backe againe to him in his affection as his God? no such matter, he is Gods enemie, and God is his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie. So if God be our God, if hee have set his love upon us, wee cannot but love him againe, if hee be reconciled to us, wee are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to him. This is a sure signe that God is our God, if we love him above all.</p>
                  <p>Now, that may be knowne, if wee be zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, when God is dishonored any way, for whatsoever we make our God, wee will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to have touched; if a man make his lust his God, if that be touched, hee is all in a chafe, when that which a man loveth is tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched) experience shews it) hee is presently all on a fire. And here the best Christians have cause to be abased; hath God their love, when they can heare him disgraced, and his name abused, without being greatly mooved, and yet notwithstanding in the meane time, will not endure their owne credit to be tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched? but they are (as I said) all on a fire: where there is no zeale, there is no love: certainely when vvee can heare Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren misused, and Religion indangered, and profession scoffed at, &amp;c. and yet not be affected, nor cannot take Gods cause to heart, this is great fault in our love.</p>

                     <pb n="129" facs="tcp:17825:246"/>
And so for joy and delight, wee make God our God, when we joy in him above all things in the world, when wee make him our boast all the day long, as it is, <hi>Psalm.</hi> 44. 8. when we make him our glory, as he is called our Glory in <hi>Ierem.</hi> 2. 11. <hi>They changed their glory:</hi> God is our glory if hee be our God, wee count it our chiefest glory, that we are his, &amp; that he is ours: whatsoever our estates be, we glory in God, and not in our selves: a Christian when he would joy and glory, hee goeth out of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to God, He is his joy. But doe not men joy in the creature and delight in it ofttimes more then in God? It is a great shame for us, and that for which even the best of us all may be abased, to consider what a deale of delight and comfort wee take in the creature more then in God. We see <hi>Ionah,</hi> a good man, when his Gourd was taken from him that God raised up to be a shelter for him; a poore simple de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence it was, and yet we see how pettish the good man was, all the comfort he had, could not keepe him from anger and fretting when the Gourd was gone, and yet God was his God. So many men, whereas they should joy in God above all things, yet if God take outward comforts from them, they are as if there were no God in heaven, no comfort there, as if there were no providence to rule theworld, as if they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>ad no Father in covenant with them. I say this is a great shame for us.</p>
                  <p>Againe, if God be our God, wee will trust
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:17825:247"/>
in him, relye and depend upon him above all things; for whatsoever our trust is most in, that is our God: now if our conscience tell us, that wee trust most in God, more then in wealth, or friends, and will not to displease God please any man, it is a signe that we have make God our God, because we trust in him. And surely, if we would examine our selves, the best of us all, it would bring us on our knees, &amp; make our faces be confounded, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what a deale of Atheisme there is in our hearts (though we are not altogether Atheists, yet what a deale there is) that must be morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and subdued. For if an honest man, and that we know is faithfull, should say to us, I will be yours, I will take upon me to provide for you, to defend you, to protect you, to stand by you against all adversaries, wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve and hope that hee will doe it, but doe we so to God? hath he our trust and affiance? Alas no; so farre forth, I meane, as wee are not subdued to God: a Christian indeed, in some measure is inabled to make God his trust and confidence, but there remaines abundance of Atheisme, even in the best of us. If God be our God, why doe we not trust in him, depend upon him for all things, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon him for protection, and deliverance from all ill (spirituall ill specially) from sin, Satan, hell, and wrath, depend upon him for all good (the good of grace specially) for the change of our nature, and the forgivenesse
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:17825:247"/>
of our sinnes; for spirituall priviledges, ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption and sonneship, for the inheritance of heaven, &amp;c. It is a signe I say, that God is our God, when wee trust in him above all the world, and trust other things onely from him and for him, I will trust man, but man may deceive me, I will not trust him therefore with an absolute confidence, no, that were to make a God of him. What is the reason that God confoundeth proud men at last? <hi>David</hi> shewes the reason, this man he tooke not the Lord for his God: when men will in contempt of Religion, set up themselves, and somewhat else to relye on besides God, God at the last brings it to passe, that the world shall note them out, this man trusted in his greatnesse, he trusted in his policy, in his wit, in his friends, this man tooke not the Lord for his God.</p>
                  <p>Againe, if we make God our God, we may know it by our obedience, especially by the obedience of the inward man; when the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man is vowed to God, when a man yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth inward obedience to God, it is a signe that God is his God; when a man can araigne his thoughts and desires before God, &amp; when lusts rise in his heart contrary to the Spirit, he checks them presently, this becommeth not those that are Gods, it beseemeth not those that walke after God, that have Gods Spirit for their leader, therefore he is asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med presently of base tentations. A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:17825:248"/>
can performe the first and last Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, which are the most spirituall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, hee can make God his God in his affections, his affections are placed upon him alone, (as I have shewed before) he can yeeld up all his inward affections of feare and love and joy, and such like unto God, which is the summe of the first Commandement, and hee can be content not to have his lusts rage and range, suppresses his very thoughts and desires, will not suffer any thing to rise in his heart unchecked and uncountrouled, which is the summe of the tenth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I meane he can doe it in some measure. And there is a inward passive obedience too: It is God (as <hi>David</hi> and other Saints said) <hi>It is the Lord, let him doe what seemeth him good in his owne eyes.</hi> I am Gods and he shall dispose of me; the soule that knoweth God to be his God, hath an inward obedience of contentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with his estate: God is my portion, and it is large enough, the earth is his and the fulnesse thereof, therefore I will be content to be at his disposing whether it be more or lesse, and if any murmuring arise in his heart against God, in respect of his estate or otherwise, he presently suppresseth it, as being contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the blessed government that a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian is under, that should resigne his whole soule unto God.</p>
                  <p>Thus by our affections, by the tryall of them, wee may know whether God be our
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:17825:248"/>
God; if wee give him the affections of the heart, which Religion most stands in, when we make the whole inward man stoope and bow, and bend unto him, when we make him our King, and give him the supremacy, when we set the Crowne upon his head, when hee hath our feare, our joy and delight, our love, our trust, I meane, when he hath the supreame of all, for we may love man, as God deriveth good to us by him, and so for the rest, but God must be supreme, others must be loved and feared, &amp;c. in him and for him, but hee chiefely, when wee depend upon him for all deliverance out of ill and for all good, and shew our dependance on him, by our subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to him in all his wayes, by our yeelding to him obedience answerable to all this, and especially when we shall shew it by performing inward worship to him, when we walke before him pefectly &amp; sincerely, as it is in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this Chapter, <hi>I am God All-sufficient, walke before me and be perfect:</hi> By this we may know, that God is our God. I need not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large it, the practise of the first Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will teach us what is our God, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we give the supremacy of the inward man to, whatsoever we love most, whatsoever wee trust most, whatsoever we feare most, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we joy and delight most, whatsoever wee obey most, that is our God. <hi>I am the Lord thy God,</hi> (in the first Commandement) there is the ground, what followes? <hi>Thou shalt have no</hi>
                     <pb n="134" facs="tcp:17825:249"/>
                     <hi>other Gods but me,</hi> that is, thou shalt love no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the world, nor feare nothing, nor trust in nothing, nor joy in nothing more then me, no, nor with me, but all things else thou shalt trust them, and feare them, &amp;c. in me and for me: otherwise what is our love is our God, what is our trust is our God, what is our greatest feare is our God: if wee feare man, feare him to doe ill, man is our God; if we love the creature, or sinne, that is our God; if wee cracke our consciences for wealth, the covetous mans wealth is his God; if wee cracke our consciences for pleasures, or for our bellies, our pleasures and our bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and our lusts are our God: we make not God our God except we give him the supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy of the inward man.</p>
                  <p>But to proceed, and to come to some few familiar signes more that will try us, though these may try us, in the intercourse that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene God and us.</p>
                  <p>Whosoever hath God for their God, they have the spirit of supplication &amp; prayer, to cry un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, to run unto him, specially in extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, all Gods children have the spirit of adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to crie, <hi>Abba Father;</hi> they have the spirit to give them boldnesse to God, when other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise their nature, and likewise trouble joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with nature, and tentations would make them runne from God, yet the Spirit of God in them makes them bold to goe to God in Jesus Christ; Gods children that are in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant

vvith him, can at all times pray to God; if they cannot pray, they can chatter and sigh to God: there is somewhat they can doe, there is a spirit in them that groaneth and sigheth, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. and God heareth the voyce of his owne Spirit, they are cryes in his eares: <hi>My groanes and sighs are not hid from thee,</hi> saith the Psalmist. The spirit of supplication vvill shevv God to be our God, because if he vvere not ours, vvee could not be bold to goe to him, in the time of extremity especially; this signe you have in the 13. <hi>Zach.</hi> last, <hi>They shall call upon my name, and I will heare them; they shall be my people, and I will be their God:</hi> Invocation &amp; prayer is a signe that God is our God, vvhen vvee goe to God presently in all our vvants and necessities by prayer. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and reprobate spirits, say to <hi>Moses, pray you for me;</hi> but as for a spirit of supplication in themselves they have not; they may speake of prayer, but they cannot pray, whosoever is Gods, he can crie to God; a child wee know the first voyce it uttereth as soone as it is borne, it cryes, so Gods new borne children they can crie unto God. <hi>Paul</hi> in the 9. Acts, you shall find him praying as soone as ever he was coverted; and certainely those that use not to pray morning and evening, and upon all occasions, that acquaint not themselves with God, God is not their God; if he were their God, they would seeke to him, and be acquainted with him, the Spirit will teach
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:17825:250"/>
them to goe unto God as to a Father.</p>
                  <p>Againe, wee may know that God is our God by this, by our separating from all others, in our selves, and out of our selves, there is a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration in our selves, for there is the first se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration. God whose God hee is, hee giveth them his Spirit, and that like fire severeth the drosse, and gathered the sold together, and as heate in the body, that severeth good nourishment, and separateth that which doth not nourish the body, sowhere the Spirit of God is, hee workes a separation betweene the flesh and the spirit, the spirit will know what is spirituall, and vvill discerne vvhat is in us that is fleshly, and vvill joyne to spirituall things, and the spirit vvill be one as it vvere, there vvill be a sweet agreement in the vvord, in the Sacraments, in good company, in holy meditation and the like, and a separation from the flesh. A Christian knowes, that hee is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed from himselfe, (as farre as hee is naught) we are redeemed from our selves and our owne base nature, as vvell as from hell and damnation, therefore there is first a separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in our selves from our selves, it begins there, vve have nothing to doe vvith our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, we will not owne them.</p>
                  <p>And vvhere this sweet Covenant is, that God is our God, as there is a separation from our selves and our corruptions, so there is a separation from all that joyneth with our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, a separation in affection, from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:17825:250"/>
in all that is not God, from all such occasions and company, as strengthneth our corruption. A Christian knowes what hee hath of Gods in him, and what he hath of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and that he must weaken, therefore he se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth himselfe from that which strengthneth the one, and weakeneth the other: this tryall is exprest in 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. last, <hi>Comeout from amongst them, separate your selves, and I will be your God, and you shall be my people;</hi> (he speakes for dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, especially in our society and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, for that is the thing hee aymeth at) how shall wee know that God will be our God? we must separate our selves, and touch no uncleane thing, nothing that will helpe rebellion: therefore those that have an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent disposition to all companies, and can so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>ace themselves in any society, though never so corrupt, that beare themselves plausible to all, and would be thought well of all, and so will venter upon all occasions, it is an ill signe that they are carnall people, when in the nearest league in friendship or amity, or in intimate familiarity, they will joyne with any, all are alike, it is a signe they have not God for their God, for then they would have common enemies and common friends with God: common enemies with God, whom God hated, they would hate: as God in Covenant blessed them that blesse us, and curseth them that curse us; so they that are in Covenant and friendship with God, will hate
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:17825:251"/>
with a perfect hatred whatsoever it is that hateth God, they will have nothing to doe in intimate familiarity further then their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings presse upon them, they will give them their due in humanity and curtesie, but no more; their love and delight will be in God, and those that are his, that represent him, that have his Spirit and Image. How oft is this, <hi>I am the Lord your God,</hi> repeated by <hi>Moses</hi> as a ground of separation from Idolatry? it is exprest almost every where, and indeed if the Lord be our God, there is ground enough of separation from all that is not God, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be otherwise.</p>
                  <p>Another signe and evidence that God is our God, is victory over our base corruptions in some measure: this you have in <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 7. <hi>He that overcometh shall inherit all things, I will be his God, and he shall be my sonne:</hi> how shall I know that God is my God, and that I am his sonne? if by the power of his Spirit, I am able to overcome and conquer in some comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table measure, base tentations, and my base corruptions and lusts, when I lye not as a beast, or as a carnall man under sinne, but God hath given me in some measure spirituall strength over sinne.</p>
                  <p>Vndoubtedly these and such like workes of the Spirit together with the testimony of the Spirit will be wheresoever God is our God.</p>

they had, but they had not God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a miserable end they made: vvhat mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable creatures are all such, when they shall say, friends have forsaken me, wealth hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken me, and health hath forsaken me; terrours lay hold upon me, the wrath of God hath over-taken me, but they cannot say, God is my God; oh such are in a miserable case, in a fearefull estate indeed: nay suppose they have all these, suppose they could say, they have a vvorld of riches, they have inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritances, they have friends, &amp;c. yet if they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not say, God is my God, all is vanity: the whole man is this, to have God to be our God: this is the whole man, to feare God &amp; keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>st, If a man have all the world, and have not God for his God, all is but vanity and vexation of spirit: never rest therefore till wee can proove our selves to be in the Covenant of grace, till we can say, God is my God.</p>
                  <p>But secondly, when wee have found God to be our God, then make this use of it, a use of resolution: is God my <hi>God?</hi> then I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve to please him, though all creatures bee against me; this was their resolution in the 4. <hi>Micah, Every Nation walketh in the name of his God, but we will walke in the name of the Lord our God for ever and ever:</hi> resolve with <hi>Ioshuah</hi> and others to please <hi>God,</hi> whosoever saith the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, to walke after the Commandements of <hi>God,</hi> whatsoever others do or say. In all discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:17825:253"/>
from men or Devils, let us set this as a buckler, <hi>God</hi> is my <hi>God.</hi> Arme our selves with resolution against all feares and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of men, of men of terrour, against the Arme of flesh, they say they will doe this, and this; I but <hi>God</hi> is my <hi>God,</hi> all that they doe they must doe in his strength: Arme our selves with this, against the power and gates of hell: feare not the Devill, if wee feare man or Devill more then <hi>God,</hi> feare them so, as to doe any thing to displease <hi>God,</hi> we make them <hi>God:</hi> If our conscience rightly tells us, that what is to be done by us, is the will and command of <hi>God,</hi> and that herein I serve <hi>God,</hi> wee need not feare any opposer, but oppose this as an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of proofe against all creatures, against all discouragements whatsoever: And certainely experience telleth us, and approoveth it to be true, that nothing can dismay a man that doth things in conscience to <hi>God,</hi> and knowes <hi>God</hi> will beare him out in it, though not from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in this world, (and yet for the most part he doth that too, those that are the stoutest men for <hi>God,</hi> are oftentimes most safe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes freed from inward dejection) yet <hi>God</hi> disposeth of it so, as that he that keepes a good conscience, shall alwayes be a King and rule over the world, and therein hee performes his promise, whatsoever discouragements hee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth outwardly, yet no discouragement can cast downe that soule that lookes to <hi>God;</hi> In his conscience hee knowes that he takes <hi>God</hi>
                     <pb n="143" facs="tcp:17825:253"/>
to be his, that hee serveth him, and that it shall goe well with him at last, that <hi>God</hi> will be Alsufficient to him, and this rayseth him above all, makes him rule and raign over his enemies, and be a terror to those that doe him hurt.</p>
                  <p>Againe, if God be our God, then let this stop all base and covetous desires after earthly things, if God be our portion, why should we grapple too much after the world then? what need we cracke our consciences and breake our peace for the mucke of the world? is not God our portion? is he not rich enough? is not hee Lord of heaven and earth? hath not hee promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed that hee will not faile us nor forsake us? <hi>I am thy exceeding great reward, saith God to Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> is not this enough? what doth Satan for us when hee getteth us to crack our consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences by griplenesse after earthly things? hee promiseth, thou shalt have this and that, but I will take God from thee, as he did <hi>Adam</hi> in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise, thou shalt have an Apple, but thou shalt loose thy God: All his solicitations to base and earthly courses tend to nothing else but to take God from us: Now when God is our God, and he hath promised to be our por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, let it be sufficient for us, let us not for the displeasing of him, take any condition from Satan or the world upon any termes.</p>
                  <p>Againe, if so be wee know this for a truth that God is our God, then let it be a use of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, to stir us up to keep and maintaine
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:17825:254"/>
and cherish acquaintance and familiarity with him; as it is in <hi>Iob.</hi> 22. <hi>Acquaint thy self with God,</hi> if we be acquainted with him now, hee will be acquainted with us in time of sorrow, in the houre of death, therefore cherish ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with him, wheresoever wee may meete with <hi>God</hi> be there much, bee much in aring, inreceiving the Sacrament, in praying to him and making our suits known to him in all our necessities, be much in the society of Saints, <hi>God</hi> hath promised to be there, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cherish the society of all that are good: what a friendly course doth <hi>God</hi> take with us? he seekes for our acquaintance, and therefore giveth us his Ordinances, the Word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, sendeth his messengers, the good motions of his Spirit to our hearts, to leave the world and vanities of it, to make us out of love with bad courses, and joyne with him in friendship and familiarity, oh let us make use of these blessed meanes, checke not these good motions, but yeeld unto them and obey them, grieve them not, the Spirit is sent to make <hi>God</hi> and us friends, who were enemies, grieve not the Spirit, entertaine his motions, that we may be acquainted with <hi>God.</hi> But doe we doe so? truly no, indeed if <hi>God</hi> will be our <hi>God</hi> to save us, and let us live in our swearing and lying, and deceiving, and in other base courses, wee would be content with him upon these tearmes, but to be our <hi>God</hi> so that wee must serve him and love him, and feare him,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:17825:254"/>
and joy in him above all, and have nothing in the world without his favour, then let him take his favour to himselfe, wee will have none of it: though men speak it not with their mouths to the world, yet the inward speech of their hearts, is to this purpose, if wee must bee the people of God, upon these tearmes, to renounce our pleasures and profits, let him bee a God to whom he will for us, if he will save us, then welcome his favour, we will bee glad of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, otherwise we will have none of it, what is the speech of the world but this? these men when they shall at the day of judgement clayme acquaintance with God, and say, Lord, Lord open to us, wee have knowne thee in the streetes &amp;c. what will God say? depart from me, you workers of iniquity, I know you not, you were acquainted with me indeed outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the ministery of my word, but you kept not an inward and spirituall familiarity with me in my ordinances, you used not the society of the saints, you entertained not the motions of my spirit which I sent to you, to leave your ill courses, I know you not, this shall bee the answer to such wretched persons.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, if by these comfortable signes wee finde <hi>God</hi> to be our <hi>God,</hi> then here is a spring of comfort opened to a Christian: if <hi>God</hi> be mine, then all that he hath is mine, hee is my Father, hee is my husband, hee is my rocke, his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, his wisedome, his providence, his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, whatsoever hee hath is mine: If wee had
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:17825:255"/>
any man in the world that had all wisedome in him, and all the strength of the world, and all goodnesse, and all love in him, and all this for us, what an excellent creature were this? <hi>God</hi> hath all this, and a Christian that hath <hi>God</hi> for his <hi>God</hi> hath all this and much more, for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is in the creator, is much more in him. Hereupon commeth all those styles, and sweet names, that <hi>God</hi> hath taken upon him in the scripture, because he would have us to know that all comforts are together in him, the names of all the creatures that are comfortable, <hi>God</hi> hath bin pleased to take upon him, to shew us what a God he is, he is water to refresh us, a sun to comfort us, a shield to keepe evill from us, a rocke to support us, chambers to cover us in the time of danger, and such like, and in every creature God hath left foot steps and beames of himselfe, that man being an understanding creature, might finde out God in them: In wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter there is a beame of his refreshing power, in the sunne, a beame of his cherishing power, and the like, and when we receive comfort from the creature, which hath but a droppe, a beame of his goodnesse, wee should consider how good God himselfe is, if this bee so comfortable, what is God that is my God, here wee use the creatures to refresh us, and God deriveth his goodnesse usually to us by them, what will he be to us in heaven, when he will be all in all: and whatsoever comfort God hath, Christ hath, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God and Christ joyne together for our
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:17825:255"/>
good, for God is in Christ reconciling the world to himselfe, and if God be ours, Christ is ours, and if God and Christ be ours, all things are ours, because all things are Gods, Angels are ours, Cherubins are ours, because God is ours. It is a point of wondrous comfort, a poor christian when he hath nothing to trust to, he may perhaps say sometime, that hee hath no friend in the world, and hee hath many ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: I but hee hath a God to goe to, if hee have not the beame, yet he hath the Sunne, if he have not the streame, yet hee hath the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, if wee have not particular benefits that others have, yet hee hath better, whatsoever portion hee have in the world, hee hath a rich portion, for God is his portion: God is my portion saith the Church, in the 3. <hi>Lumenta.</hi> therefore will I hope in him: The poor Church had nothing else in the world to comfort it, for it was in captivity, in the middest of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, had no wealth nor friends, nor any thing, yea but God is my portion saith my soule, and therefore God being mine, in him I have friends, and wealth, and pleasure, and all whatsoever, and so hath every Christian soule, and never more then when the creature and the comfort of it is taken away: hee never findes God more his God, then when hee is deprived of those meanes that usually derive comfort to him, for then God immediately commeth to the soule, and comforteth it, and the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of a true Christian is at those times to
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:17825:256"/>
take advantage by grace to get nearer to God, to cling faster to him, to solaae himselfe more in him as his portion. What a spring of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort is here arising to a Christian in all estates? If God be his God, then hee may claime him upon all occasions, and at all times, as the saints in the Scripture have done. <hi>David, Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saphat,</hi> and all the saints what doe they alledge in their prayers to God? thou art our God, we are thy people, the sheepe of thy pasture, the vine that thy right hand hath planted, the Lord is my shepherd &amp;c. What made the disciples when they were ready to bee drowned to cry out, <hi>Master save us?</hi> but because they knew that they were servants in Covenant, that hee was their Master, we should use this as a plea to God in all the Calamities of the Church, we are thine, thou art ours: doubtlesse thou art our God (saith the Church) though <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> have forgotten, and <hi>Israel</hi> be ignorant of us. It is a point of spiritual wisedome, when we know we are in Covenant with God, to improve it as an argument to perswade God to helpe us in any streight: I am thine, <hi>Lord save mee saith David, Psal.</hi> 119. Thou art my God, Lord looke to me, protect me, direct me, ease me, recieve my soule, this is a plea that obtaineth any thing of God in all extremities whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.
<q>I will establish my Covenant betweene me and hee, and thy seed after thee, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I come now to the qualities of this cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:17825:256"/>
and before I speak in particular of them, I beseech you observe one thing (which I will but touch, to make an entrance to that which followes) from the manner of setting downe the Covenant: it is not here set downe as it is in other places of Scripture, I will bee thy God, and thou shalt bee my people, but here is only the first part, the maine of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace recyted, I will be thy God, why doth he not say too, thou shalt take me for thy God, because where the first is, he ever works the second, our part depends upon his: all our grace that wee have to answer the Covenant is by reflexion from God, hee chuseth us, and then we chuse him: he knoweth us, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee come to know him, he loveth us first, and then we love him, he singleth us out to be a peculiar people, and we single out him above all things to be our portion, whom have I in heaven but thee?</p>
                  <p>It is therefore (to come to the first quality) called a free Covenant, it cometh from God, meerely of grace, it is of grace, that he would enter into any tearmes of agreement with us; it is of grace that he would send Christ to dye, to be the foundation of the covenant; it is of grace that he giveth us hearts to take him for our God, to depend upon him, to love him, to serve him, &amp;c. All is of grace, and all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from him.</p>
                  <p>So you see, that it is a free Covenant, that's the first quality.</p>
                  <pb n="250" facs="tcp:17825:257"/>
                  <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                     <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="251" facs="tcp:17825:257"/>
                  <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                     <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="250" facs="tcp:17825:258"/>
Againe, secondly it is a sure, a certaine Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. I will establish my covenant. But in whom it is established, how commeth it to be sure? It is established in Christ, the Mediator of the covenant, in the <hi>Messiah:</hi> for in thy seed shall all the Nations of the earth bee blessed. That's the fundamentall promise, all other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, the promise, of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> the promise of the multiplying his seed, as the starres of Heaven, they were all but acces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, this is the grand promise, in thy seed, in <hi>Christ,</hi> shall all the Nations of the earth bee blessed. So it is a sure Covenant, because it is established in the <hi>Messiah, Christ, God-man.</hi> And <hi>Christ</hi> being God and man, is fit to be the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Covenant, betweene God and man, for he is a friend to both parties: as man, hee will doe all that is helpefull for man, and as God, he will doe nothing that may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate from God; and so being God, and being God and man, he brings God and man together comfortably, and sweetly, and kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth them together in a sure and firme agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For first of all hee takes away the cause of division that was betweene God and us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause by his sacrifice and obedience, he did sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie Gods wrath, and that being satisfied, God and us are at peace, and friendship: for God till then, though he bee a fountaine of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, yet he was a fountaine sealed, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine was stopped by sinne, but when there is a satisfaction made by Christ, and we believing
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:17825:258"/>
on him, the satisfaction of Christ is made ours, it is a sure Covenant, because it is established in Christ, the blessed seed.</p>
                  <p>And as it is a sure Covenant, so thirdly it is an everlasting Covenant, I will make an everlasting Covenant with thee, so it is set downe here.</p>
                  <p>Everlasting in these respects. For when wee are in Christ, and made one with him by faith, hee having satisfied Gods wrath for us, and made him peaceable, then God is become our father, and he is an everlasting father, his love to us in Christ is like himselfe, immutable. For even as Christ, when hee tooke upon him our nature, he made an everlasting Covenant with our nature, married our nature to himself for ever, and never layeth aside his humaine nature, so he will never lay aside his misticall body, his Church. As Christ is God-man for ever, so misticall <hi>Christ,</hi> the Church, is his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for ever. As <hi>Christ</hi> will not lose his naturall, so he will not lose his misticall body, I will marry thee to my selfe for ever (saith God in the Prophet) so then it is everlasting in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of God, hee being Immutable, I am God saith he, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 6.) and I change not, and Christ, the foundation of the covenant, is everlasting.</p>
                  <p>And then againe it is everlasting, in regard of us, because, if wee bee not wanting to our selves, wee shall bee for evermore, in Grace heere, and in Glory for ever: the fruites of Grace in us, that is, the work of the Spirit, it is
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:17825:259"/>
everlasting, for howsoever the graces we have, be but the first fruits of the spirit, yet our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man growes more and more, till grace end in glory, till the first fruits end in a harvest, till the foundation bee accomplished in the building, God never takes away his hand from his owne worke.</p>
                  <p>Everlasting also in regard of the body of Christians, God makes a covenant with one, and when they are gone, with others, alwayes God will have some in Covenant with him, he will have some, to be a God to, when we are gon, so long as the world continueth.</p>
                  <p>So that we see it is in every respect an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting covenant, God is everlasting, Christ is everlasting, the graces of the spirit are everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting. When we are dead, he will be a God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, as it is said, <hi>I am the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Iacob,</hi> their God when they were dead: he is the God of our dust, of our dead bodies; he will raise them up, for they are bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes in Covenant with him, I am the God of whole Abraham, and not of a piece, therefore his body shall rise againe. It is an everlasting Covenant. That is the third quality.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, it is a peculiar Covenant. I will be thy God, and the God of thy seed. All are not the children of Abraham, but they that are of the faith of Abraham, God is in Covenant only with those that answer him, that take him for their God, that are a peculiar people: It is not glorying in the flesh, but there must
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:17825:259"/>
be somewhat wrought that is peculiar, before we can be assured we are of Abrahams seed, and in Covenant with God.</p>
                  <p>And we may know that we are Gods peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar by some peculiar thing that wee can doe: what peculiar thing canst thou doe? (to speak a little of that by the way) thou lovest, and art kind, but saith Christ, what peculiar thing canst thou doe? A heathen man may be kind and loving, but canst thou overcome revenge, canst thou spare, and doe good to thine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies? canst thou trust in God when all means faile? what is the power of the spirit in thee? doth it triumph in thee over thy naturall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption? canst thou doe as <hi>Abrams</hi> did? hee left all at Gods command, canst thou doe that if need should be? canst thou leave children, and wife, and life, and all at Gods command? Canst thou sacrifice <hi>Isaac</hi> as he did? canst thou more trust in the promise of God, then in the dearest thing in the world, yea, then in thy own feeling of grace? whatsoever is not God, canst thou be content to be without? canst thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye upon God, when he appeareth to be an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry God? <hi>Abraham</hi> knew that there was more comfort in the promise, than in <hi>Isaac,</hi> if thou have comfort in the promise more than in any thing else, then thou art one of <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed, thou hast sacrificed thy <hi>Isaack,</hi> never talke of <hi>Abraham</hi> else, never thinke that thy portion is great in God, be what thou wilt by profession, if there be no particular thing in thee which
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:17825:260"/>
is not in a naturall man, if thou art covetous, as gripple for the world, as very a drudge in thy calling; as licentious in thy course as carnall men are, thou art none of Gods peculiar ones, thou art none of <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed. Gods people have somewhat peculiar that the world hath not. It is a peculiar Covenant.</p>
                  <p>Thus you see the qualities of this Covenant, it is a free Covenant, a sure Covenant stablished in the blessed seed, the <hi>Messiah,</hi> it is an Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Covenant, and it is a peculiar Covenant.
<q>To make some vse of this in a word.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Heere then you see is another Spring of bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed comfort opened to a Christian. If hee fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth God (though this assurance bee little) to be his God in regard of peculiar favours, let him remember it is an everlasting favour, his love is everlasting, the foundation is everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, the graces of the spirit are an everlasting spring, alwayes issuing from Christ our head, grace is never drawne dry in him. God is our God to death, and in death, and for ever: all things in the world will faile us, friends will faile us, all comforts will faile us, life will faile us ere long, but this is an everlasting covenant which will not faile.</p>
                  <p>It is a point of comfort in the losse of friends, in the losse of estate in this world: If I lose friends, yet I cannot lose God, if hee be mine, he is mine for ever, a friend now, and a friend
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:17825:260"/>
ever, my portion now, and my portion for ever, whatsoever God takes away, hee never takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way himselfe, and in him I have all that is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, all the comfort that hee doth still derive to mee by friends, hee resumeih to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, it is not perished with the party, he can immediately by himselfe convey whatsoever comfort was derived to me by others: he is God Al-sufficient, that is, put the case all the world were taken away, not only friends, but the sun, the light, the earth, food and rayment, all, as it shall be at the day of judgement, if all bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, yet I have him, yet I have him that made all, that supporteth all, cannot he doe all in a more excellent manner, is not he Al-suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, though I lose all things else? It is a point of wondrous comfort, God knew it well enough, therefore he laboureth to stablish the heart of the father of the faithfull, good <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> here with this instead of all. I am God Alsufficient, and I will be thy God.</p>
                  <p>Againe, if this be so, that God will be a God to us for ever, let us comfort our selves hence in all the unfaithfull dealings of men, they are friends to day, and enemies to morrow, but God is my God, and whom he loveth, hee loveth to the end. An ingenuous spirit certainely estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth it the greatest crosse in the world, and if any thing will whet a man to heaven, this is one, that those whom hee trusteth will prove false, and at length deceive him: Man is but man, in the ballance hee is lighter then vanity,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:17825:261"/>
but he that is in Covenant with God, his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise and love, and faithfulnesse never faileth: A Christian in all the breaches of this world, hath this comfort, that he hath a sure God to trust to, hee that hath not God to trust to, and is unfaithfully dealt withall in the world, what a wretched man is hee? this was <hi>Davids</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, when he was beset with calamities, and miseries, all tooke from him, and the people were ready to stone him, he trusted in the Lord his God. I come to the extent of it. 
<q>To thee and to thy seed after thee.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Why doth he make the Covenant with his seed, as well as with himselfe?</p>
                  <p>I answer, we apprehend favours and curses more in our seed ofttimes, then in our selves; and it will humble a man to see calamities on his posterity, more then on himselfe, and a man more rejoyceth to see the flourishing of his seed, them of himselfe. It is said that <hi>Iosiah</hi> did dye in peace, though he dyed a bloody death, because hee saw not the ruine of his house and family, which was worse then death. God saw how <hi>Abraham</hi> apprehended and valued seed, when hee said, <hi>what wilt thou give me, since I am childlesse?</hi> therefore God intending a comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table enlargement of the covenant of Grace to <hi>Abraham,</hi> extends it to his seed. I <hi>will be the God of thy seed.</hi> It is a great blessing for God to bee the God of our seed: it is alluded to by S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
                     <pb n="157" facs="tcp:17825:261"/>
in the new Testament, <hi>The promise is made to you and to your Children.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But what if they have not Baptisme, the seal of the Covenant?</p>
                  <p>That doth not prejudice their salvation, God hath appointed the sacraments to be seales for us, not for himselfe, hee himselfe keepeth his Covenant, whether we have the seale or no, so long as we neglect it not, therefore we must not thinke if a childe dye before the sacrament of baptisme, that God will not keepe his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, they have the sanctity, the holinesse of the Covenant. You know what <hi>David</hi> said of his childe, <hi>I shall goe to it, but it shall not returne to me,</hi> and yet it dyed before it was circumcised. You know they were 40 yeers in the wildernes and were not circumcised, therefore the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not of absolute necessity to salvation. So, he is the God of our children, from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception and birth.</p>
                  <p>But how can God bee the God of our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, when they are borne in corruption, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of wrath? Can they bee Children of wrath, and the Children of God both at one time?</p>
                  <p>I answer yes, both as one time, for even as in civill matters, in our city here, a man may be a free-man of the city, and yet be borne lame or leprous, or with some contageous disease, this hindreth not his freedome: so the children of a believing father and mother, may bee free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the city of <hi>God,</hi> and in the covenant
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:17825:262"/>
of grace, and yet be tainted with originall sin, that over-spreadeth the powers of the soul not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding.</p>
                  <p>Whence we see a ground of baptizing infants, because they are in the Covenant. To whom the Covenant belongs: the seal of it belongs, but to infants the Covenant belongs, therefore the seale of it, Baptisme, belongeth to them: If circumcision belonged to them, then Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme doth, but circumcision belonged to them: for the eighth day they were circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, therefore Baptisme belongeth to them.</p>
                  <p>Anabaptisticall spirits would not have chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren baptized, if they believe not: why then were the Children of the Iewes circumcised? They were circumcised, because they were in Covenant: and is not the Covenant of grace enlarged? wherein doth the new Covenant dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from the old, but (among many other things) in the enlargement of it? there is now a new people, the Gentiles in Covenant, that were not before, new Priests, new sacrifices, new sacraments, all is new in the covenant of grace: if all be enlarged in the covenant, why should we deny the seale of the covenant to them in the new, that had it in the old, even children? It is sencelesse. The Scripture to meete with such, applyeth baptisme to them, and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision to us, to shew, that in the covenant of grace, they are all one in effect, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. <hi>All they were baptized under the cloud,</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, 1 <hi>Colos. Wee are circumcised with circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
                     <pb n="159" facs="tcp:17825:262"/>
without hands. We are circumcised, and they were baptized: to shew I say that all are one in Christ. Christ is all one, <hi>yesterday, to day, and the same for ever, yesterday</hi> to them that were under the law, <hi>and to day</hi> to us under the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and for ever to posterity; and therefore if Children had interest in Christ then, so they have now. This is cleare, and undeniable, God is the God of our Children.</p>
                  <p>This should bee an encouragement to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, to bee good, if not for love of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and their owne soules, yet for their Children and posterity sake, that God may do good to their children for them, they cannot deserve worse of their children, then to bee naught themselves.</p>
                  <p>How many examples are there in Scripture that God plagued and punished the children for the fathers sinnes? though in the maine matter hee will not doe it sometimes, because he is gracious and good, he will be good to the children, though their parents bee naught, as <hi>Ioshua,</hi> and <hi>Caleb</hi> came into Canaan, though their parents were rebels, and died in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. Yet it is a discomfortable thing, when parents are naught, they may looke that God should punish their sin in their Children.</p>
                  <p>There is a great deale of care taken by car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall parents, here in the City, (and every where too; but in the City especially) by covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, a reigning sin: they will not make God their God, but the wedge of Gold to be their
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:17825:263"/>
God. They labour to make their children great, if they can leave them rich men, great men in a parish, to beare office, to come to honour, that is their maine endeavour, for this they drudge and neglect heaven and happinesse. But, alas, what is this? Thou mayst leave them much goods; and the vengeance of God with them, thou maist leave them much wealth, and it may be a snare to them, it were better thou hadst left them nothing.</p>
                  <p>Looke into the state of the City, those that are best able in the City, doe they not rise of nothing? and they that have bin the greatest labourers for these outward things, that they may call their lands after their owne names, God hath blowne upon them, and all hath come to nought in a short time, because they have not made God their portion. Of all things parents should labour to leave them God for their God: to leave them in Covenant with him, lay up prayers in heaven for them, lay the foundation there, sowe prayers there, that may be effectuall for them when you are gone.</p>
                  <p>And this likewise should bee a comfort to poore Christians, that have not much to leave their children. I can leave my childe nothing, but I shall leave him in Covenant with God: for God is my God, and alwayes hath bin, and ever will be, he will bee the God of my seed. I shal leave him Gods blessing, <hi>and a little well got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten goods that the righteous hath, is better then a great deale ill gotten, God addeth no sorrow with that.</hi>
                     <pb n="161" facs="tcp:17825:263"/>
There is no fearefull expectation another day, as there is, of that which is ill gotten, when the father and childe shall meet in hell, and curse one another, when the sonne shall say to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, you insnared your selfe to make me happy, and that turned to my ruine: this shall make wicked wretches curse one another one day. A poore Christian that cannot say he hath riches to leave his children, yet he can say, God is my <hi>God,</hi> and I am sure he will be their <hi>God,</hi> though I have but little to leave them else, I shall leave them <hi>Gods</hi> blessing. Good parents may hope for a blessing upon their children, because God is their God, and the God of their seed. For the sacrament, a word.</p>
                  <p>The Sacrament is a seale of this Covenant, that God is our God in Christ, and wee are his people. God to his word addeth seales, to help our faith: what a good God is this? how wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is hee to have us believe him? one would thinke that a word from him, a promise, were enough, but to his promise hee addeth a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: one would think a covenant were enough, but to that hee addeth seales, and to them an oath too. <hi>I have sworne to David my servant.</hi> Thus hee stoopes to all conditions of men, he condescendeth so farre, to use all these meanes, that hee may secure us. You know that a promise secures us, if it be from one that is an honest man, wee say that wee are sure to have it because of his promise: but when wee have his Covenant, then wee are assured
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:17825:264"/>
more because there is somewhat drawne. Now wee have Gods covenant, and his seale, the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and then his oath. If we will take him for our God, and renounce our wicked cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, wee shall lose nothing by it, wee shall part with nothing for God, but we shall have it sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in him. If we lose honour, wealth, or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, we shall have it abundantly in him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>What doe we heare in the sacrament? doe we come only to receive his love to us? No, we make a covenant with God in the Sacrament, that hee shall be our God, and wee promise by his grace to lead new lives hence forth, wee have made a Covenant with God at first in Baptism, now we renew it in taking the Sacrament, and it is fit, for if he renew his covenant oft to us in love to be ours, we should renew ours oft with him, to take him to be our God. Seaven times in <hi>Gen.</hi> he renewed his covenant to <hi>Abraham,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hee would have him trust what hee said; then we should seven times, that is oft, come to the Sacrament, and renew our Covenant with him, to take him for our God: and remember what ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> to sin after the receiving the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>. Sins against conscience break off a covenant renewed, sin hath an aggravation now, you that mean to receive, if you sin willingly after, 'twere better you had not received: what makes adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery worse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fornication? saith <hi>Mal: Twas the wife of thy covenant:</hi> adultery breaks the covena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of marriage, it is worse then fornication where there is not a covenant. So you have made á co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:17825:264"/>
with God in your Baptisme, and now you come to renew it; if you sinne now, it is an aggravation of the sinne, it is adulterie, it is disloyaltie against God.</p>
                  <p>Remember therefore, that we doe not onely take here Gods kindnesse sealed in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but we repromise back againe to lead new lives. All must resolve by his grace to obey him henceforward; and to take him for our God. The way therefore will be to put this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the condition of your promise now, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er after: Lord, I have promised this, but thou knowest I cannot performe the promise I have made, and the condition thou requirest, of my selfe: but in the Covenant of grace, thou hast said that thou wilt make good the condition: thou hast promised to give the <hi>spirit to them that aske him;</hi> thou hast promised to <hi>Circumcise my heart,</hi> thou hast promised <hi>to teach me,</hi> thou hast promised to delight over <hi>me</hi> for good, thou hast promised to <hi>Wash me with cleane water,</hi> thou hast promised <hi>to put thy feare in my heart,</hi> thou hast promised <hi>to write</hi> thy Law in the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; I would feare thee, and love thee, and trust in thee, and delight in thee: thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est I cannot fulfill the conditions, thou art a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and willing; thou art as able to make me doe these things as to command me to doe them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus we should desire God to give the grace that he requires in the use of the meanes; for that must not be neglected, we must attend
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:17825:265"/>
upon the Ordinances, use the parts that are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us, and in that, <hi>to him that hath, shall bee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:</hi> thou shalt not need any necessary good to bring thee to heaven, if thou wilt clayme the promise of the covenant in the use of meanes: wee shall want degrees perhaps, but in the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace, it is not degrees that brings us to heaven, but truth.</p>
                  <p>Now in our renewing the Covenant with God, let us not despaire of his performance, let not that hinder us from comming to the Sacrament, but come cheerefully, and know, that hee that hath made the Covenant with thee to be thy God, and to give thee all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular grace (in the use of all good meanes) will performe it: Hee will performe it, if wee come in sincerity of heart. If wee come to daube with God, and after to follow our sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full courses, this is to mocke God. This made <hi>David</hi> take it to heart so much, that <hi>his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar friend that eate at his table, lift up his heele against mee.</hi> May not God complaine of us, that we come to the communion, to his table, with false <hi>Iudas</hi> hearts, and afterwards betray him? hee may say, my familiar friends they came, and eat with me, yet they have lift up the heele against me, they are rebellious, they will leave no finne, that before they were enthral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to, so instead of a blessing, wee bring a curse upon us, a just reward of our disloyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Oh remember that it is a great aggravation of sinne, after the Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="165" facs="tcp:17825:265"/>
I speake not this to discourage any, but to encourage us rather, if wee come with sincere hearts, and with resolution to please God, wee may looke for all the promises from God, all that hee hath promised, hee is ready to performe, if wee in faith can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge the promise. <hi>Lord remember thy promise, wherein thou hast caused thy servant to put his trust.</hi>

<q>The like figure whereunto, baptisme also saveth us, &amp;c.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here first of all in a word, is a description of <note place="margin">Parts of the Text.</note> the meanes of salvation, how we are saved, <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme saveth us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then there is a prevention of an obiection; <hi>not the putting away of the filth of the flesh:</hi> the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward part of Baptisme.</p>
                  <p>Then he sets downe how Baptisme saves us: But <hi>the answere of a good Conscience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then the ground of it, by <hi>the resurrection of Iesus Christ.</hi>

The former I passe over, that I may come to that which I specially intend. I come therefore to the prevention of the objection, which I will not speake much of, but somewhat, because it is a usefull point. When he said that Baptisme saves us, he saith, not that Baptisme which is a putting away <hi>the filth of the flesh,</hi> insinuating this, <note place="margin">2. Parts of Baptisme.</note> that Baptisme hath two parts: there is a double Baptisme; the outward, which is the washing of the bodie; the inward, which is the washing of the soule: the outward doth not save without the inward. Therefore he prevents them, least they should thinke that all are saved by <hi>Christ,</hi> that are Baptised, that have their bodies wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed outwardly with water. The Apostle knew this, that people are naturally prone to give too much to outward things. The Devill in people is in extreames, he labours to bring people to <note place="margin">The Devill carries to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treames.</note> extreames, to make the Sacraments Idolls, or Idle: to make the outward Sacrament a meere Idoll, to give all to that, or to make them Idle signes, the Devill hath what he would in both. The Apostle knew the disease of the times, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially <note place="margin">Men prone to give too much to outward<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> worship.</note> in his time, they attributed too much to outward things. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> writing to the <hi>Galathians,</hi> he is faine twice to repeat it, <hi>Neither Circumcision availeth any thing, or uncircumcision, but a new creature:</hi> you stand too much on out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things; that that God requires especially, is the new creature.</p>
                  <p>So in the old Testament, when God prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed both outward and inward worship; they
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:17825:269"/>
attributed too much to the outward, and let the inward alone. As in <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. God complaines <note place="margin">Psal. 50.</note> how they served him, therefore saith he, <hi>what hast thou to doe to take my Covenant into thy mouth, and hatest to be reformed?</hi> And so in <hi>Isay</hi> 1. and <hi>Isay</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Isay 1. Isay ult.</note> 
                     <hi>the last,</hi> we see Gods peremptory dealing with them: <hi>I will none of your new Moones, I abhorre your offerings.</hi> And in <hi>Isay ult. It was as the cutting off of a Dogges neck, the offering of sacrifice</hi> and yet they were sacrifices appointed by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. What was the reason of this? They play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the hypocrites with God, and gave him one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the shell: they brought him outward per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, they attributed too much to that, and left the spirituall part, that God most e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemes. So our <hi>Saviour Christ</hi> to the <hi>Pharises,</hi> we see how he takes them up, <hi>say not with your selves, we have Abraham to our Father.</hi> They boa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> ed too much of their outward privileges: You see through the current of the Scriptures, those especially that belong not to God, they are apt to attribute too much to outward things; It were well if they would joyne the inward too, which they neglect. There are 2 parts of Gods service, outward &amp; inward, that is harsh to flesh and bloud. As in Baptisme there are 2 parts, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and inward washing; and in hearing the Word, is the outward man &amp; inward soule, when it bowes to heare what <hi>God</hi> saith: so in the <hi>Lords</hi> Supper, there is outward receiving of Bread and Wine, and inward making of a Covenant with <hi>God.</hi> Now people give too much to the outward,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:17825:270"/>
and thinke that God is beholding to them for it: but now for the inward; because they are conscious of their lusts, they care not for that.</p>
                  <p>But more particularly, the reason is in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature.</p>
                  <p>First, because the outward part is easie, and glorious to the eye of the world: every one can <note place="margin">Reason, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances easie and glorious.</note> see the Sacrament administred, every one can see when one comes, and attends, and heares the word of God, they are easie, and glorious in the eye of the world.</p>
                  <p>And then againe, people rest in them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <note place="margin">2. They dawbe Conscience.</note> somewhat is done by it to dawbe consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that would c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>mour if they should do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, if they were direct Atheists, therefore say they, we will heare the word, and performe outward things; and being loath to search into the bottome of their conscience rest in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things, and satisfie conscience by it: these and the like reasons there are:</p>
                  <p>Let us take notice of it, and take heed of the <note place="margin">Vse. To performe inward service.</note> corruption of nature in it: Let us know that God regards not the outward, without the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, nay he abhors it, he abhors his owne wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship that he hath appointed himselfe, if the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward be not there: much more devises, and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of mens owne devising. Poperie is but an out-side of Religion, they labour to put off God with the worke done: they have an opinion fit to corrupt nature: that is, that the Sacrament administred confersgrace, without any disposing of the partie. One of the Chiefe
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:17825:270"/>
of them, a great Scholler, he will have the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it selfe to be elevated above its owne nature to conferre grace, as if grace had any commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with a dead element. And thus they speak, to make people dote too much upon outward things. I will not stand to confute this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: this very text sheweth, that the outward part of Baptisme, without the inward, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, not the washing of the body, but <hi>the answer of a good Conscience,</hi> saith S. <hi>Peter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us labour therefore in all our services of God, to bring especially the spirituall part: The Prophet <hi>Hosea</hi> findes fault with <hi>Ephraim, They loved to tread out the Corne, but not to weare the Yoake.</hi> Now the Oxe that weares no yoake, it is no trouble to tread out the Corne, they fed upon the corne as they trod it, <hi>thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the Oxe that treadeth out the Corne:</hi> So Christians are like <hi>Ephraim,</hi> they are content to take the easie part of Religion: but to take the yoake, that which is hard, that they love not: now wee must labour tob eare the yoake of Religion: What the heart doth is done in Religion, what the heart doth not, is not done, and there is a kind of Divinity, a Divine power in all the parts of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship that is requisite, besides the bringing of the outward man: As in hearing, there is required a divine power to make a man heare as he ought to doe, to bow the neck of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man of the soul: &amp; so to receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, more is required then the outward man.
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:17825:271"/>
There is a forme and power in all the parts of Religion. Let us not rest in the forme, but la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for the power: there is a power in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Word, to transforme us into the obedience of it, and a power in the Sacrament to renew our Covenants with God for a new life, and to cast our selves altogether upon Gods Mercy in Jesus Christ (besides the outward elements, to have further Communion with Christ.</p>
                  <p>Wee see what kind of persons those were in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. <hi>That practised a form of Religion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>the power,</hi> hee names a Catalogue of sinnes there, <hi>They were Lovers of pleasures, more then Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of God:</hi> yet these people will have a forme of Religion notwithstanding, but they deny the power of it. But I hasten to that that I will more dwell on.</p>
                  <p>The Ministers likewise are to learne their <note place="margin">Vse 2. Ministers du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> duty hence, to observe the dispositions of people, and what barres they lay to their own salvation: if wee see them superstitious, that they swel in outward performances, and so are deluded by Sathan in an ill state, and feed themselves with huskes, then we are to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way such objections as much as wee can, as S. <hi>Peter</hi> here, when he had said that Baptisme an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers to the Flood, both shew the deliverance of Gods people by the blood of Christ, I saith he, not the outward Baptisme, the washing of the Body, but the answer <hi>of a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="177" facs="tcp:17825:271"/>
So Christ takes away a secret objection, say not with your selves, <hi>we have Abraham to our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> And to feed people in their ill humours, this is not the way: but to labour to make them spirituall: for God is a spirit, and hee loves that part of his worship that is spirituall and inward. Wee shall have no man damned in the Church, if there were not an inward spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual part of Gods worship: for the worst men of all wil be busiest in outward performances, and glory most in it of any other. It is a delusion that brings thousands to hell, and that made me a little dwell upon it. But I goe on. <hi>Not the washing away the filth of the body,</hi> 
                     <q>But the answer of a good Conscience.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon the preventing of an objection, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving their false confidence, hee positively sets downe what that is that doth save in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, saith he, it is <hi>the answer of a good Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi> The Scope of the words should have mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the holy Apostle to have said thus, not <hi>the putting off the filth of the Body,</hi> but the putting off the filth of the soule: but instead of that hee sets downe the act of the soule, which is an <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer of a good Conscience to God, by the Resurrection of Iesus Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Where first of all, you must know this for a ground (indeed it is a hard place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I will only take that that I think fittest, and rayse what observations I think fit for you, that
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:17825:272"/>
out of that; you must know for a ground) that
<q>There is a Covenant of Grace.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Since God and Man brake in the Creation, there is a Covenant which we call a <hi>Covenant of Grace.</hi> God hath stooped so low, hee hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descended to enter into tearmes of Covenant with us: Now the foundation of this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is, that God will bee our God, and give us grace and glory, and all good in Christ the Mediator of the new Covenant. Christ is the <note place="margin">Christ the foundation of the Covenant of Grace.</note> foundation of the Covenant, the Mediator of the Covenant, a friend to both: to God as God, to man as man, God and man in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and by office; such is his office, as to procure love and agreement betweene God and man. He being the foundation of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, there must be agreement in him. Now Christ is the foundation of the Covenant, by satisfying Gods justice: else God and wee could never have come to good tearmes, nor conscience could ever have bin satisfyed. For God must bee satisfyed before conscience bee satisfied: Conscience else would thinke God is angry, and he hath not received full satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and conscience will never bee satisfied but with that that God is satisfied with. God is satisfied with the Death of the Mediator: so conscience being sprinkled with the blood of Christ, applying the death of <hi>Christ,</hi> conscience is satisfied too. Now what doth shew, that the death of the Mediator is a sufficient sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and Satisfaction? The Resurrection
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:17825:272"/>
of Christ: for Christ our surety should have laine in the grave to this day, if our sinnes had not bin fully satisfied for.</p>
                  <p>Christ is the foundation of the Covenant of grace, by his humiliation, and by his exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, whereof the resurrection was the first degree. Now in this as in other covenants, there is the party promising, making the Covenant; and the parties that answer in the Covenant. God promises life everlasting, forgivenesse of sins through the death of Christ, the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; we answer by faith, that we relye upon <hi>Gods</hi> mercy in Christ, this is the answer of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Now this sound answer of conscience, it doth save us, because it doth lay hold on <hi>Christ,</hi> that doth save us, Christ properly saveth us, by his death, and passion. An argument of the sufficiency of his salvation, was his resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, hee is now in Heaven triumphing, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is somewhat in us that must lay hold of this salvation, it is attributed to that that is the instrument of salvation, that is, to the answer of a good conscience. Now this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer of a good conscience, doth afford us this observation, that 
<q>There must bee something in us before wee can <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Observ.</hi> There must be somewhat in us, to make use of that is in Christ.</note> make use of what good is in God, or Christ.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In a Covenant, both parties must agree, there must bee somewhat wrought in us that must
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:17825:273"/>
answer, or else we cannot clayme any good by the promises in Christ, or by any good that Christ hath wrought: that is the answer of a good conscience. Or else Christ should save all, if there were not the answer of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science required, that only Gods elect children have. But to shew the reasons of this, that there must on our part be this answer.</p>
                  <p>The reason is partly from the nature of the <note place="margin">Reas. 1. From the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Covenant.</note> Covenant, there must bee consent on both sides, or else the Covenant cannot hold, there are Indentures drawn between God and us, God promiseth all good, if wee believe and rest on Christ: we again rest upon Christ, and so have interest in all that is good. There is a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall engagement then in the Covenant. God engageth himselfe to us, and wee engage our solves to God in Christ, and where this mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all engagement is, there the Covenant is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as here, there <hi>is the answer of a good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi> That is the first reason then, from the nature of the Covenant, there must bee this answer.</p>
                  <p>The second reason that there must be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in us, is, because when two agree there <note place="margin">Reas. 2. Where agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, there is a like dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.</note> must bee a like disposition. Now there must bee a sanctifying of our Nature (from whence this blessed answer comes, before that God and wee can agree: There must bee a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondency of disposition of necessity, this must bee: for wee enter into tearmes of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with God, in the Covenant of Grace.
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:17825:273"/>
Now friends must have the same mind, there must be an answering. Now this answer is espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially faith, when we believe, and from Faith, sanctified obedience, that is called the resti pulation, or engagement of a good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God, when the promise is made, wee engage our selves to believe, and to live as chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</p>
                  <p>Now from this that there must be an answer <note place="margin">Vse. To search our hearts for the evidence of our estate.</note> in us, an engagement on our part; I beseech you let us in generall therefore know, that wee must search our own hearts, for the evidence of our good estate in Religion: let us not so much search what Christ hath done, but search our owne hearts how wee have engaged our selves to God in Christ, that we believe and witnesse our believing, that wee lead a life answerable to our Faith: renounce all but Christ. This mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall engagement is in the forme in Baptisme, that was used by the Apostles, and by the ancient Church: for wee know that in the ancient Church, that they that were Baptized, they were questioned, doe you believe? I doe believe. Doe you renownce the Flesh, and the World, and the Divell? I doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce them: These two questions were made, now when they answered this question from a good conscience, truly, faithfully, and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, then they had right in all the good things by Christ. Something alway therefore in the Church was required on our part. Not that wee answer by our owne strength, for it is
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:17825:274"/>
the Covenant of grace: why is it a Covenant of grace? not onely because the things promised <note place="margin">Covenant of grace why so called.</note> are promised of grace: but because our part is of grace likewise, we beleeve of grace, and live holily of grace: every good thought is from grace, it is by grace that we are that we are. All is of grace in the new Covenant, meerely of grace, <hi>God</hi> requires not any answering by our strength: for then he should require light of darknesse, and life of death. There is nothing good in us; he requires obedience that he may worke it when he requires it. For his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands in the Covenant of grace, they are ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, and working, when he commands us to beleeve, and obey, he gives us grace to beleeve, and obey. It is our selves that answere, but not from our selves, but from grace; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, let us make this use of it, letus search our selves, though it be not from our selves: that we answere <hi>Gods</hi> promise by faith, and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand by obedience, yet we must have this obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, (though from him) before we can chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge any thing at <hi>Gods</hi> hands. It is arrogant presumption, to hope for Heaven and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: before we have grace to answere all <hi>Gods</hi> promises and commands, by a good conscience.</p>
                  <p>To come more particularly to the words: some will have it, the Questioning, the <note place="margin">Demand of conscience proceedes from the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer of it.</note> Demand of a good Conscience: but that followes the other. For when wee answere truely the interrogatories in Baptisme, when
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:17825:274"/>
we beleeve and renounce, then we may from a good conscience demand of God, all the good in <hi>Christ:</hi> we may cal upon him, &amp; pray unto him, hath not <hi>Christ</hi> died, and made peace betweene thee, and us? And may we not triumph against all enemies when there is the answere of a good Conscience? If Sathan lay any thing to our charge, <hi>Christ</hi> died, and rose, and sits at the right hand of God. <hi>Who shall lay any thing to the charge of Gods people?</hi> We may (with a heart sprinkled with the blood of <hi>Christ</hi> now ascended into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven) answere all objections; and triumph a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all enemies, wee may goe boldly to God; and demand the performance of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises.</p>
                  <p>Hence comes all the spirit of boldnesse, in prayer, from the answere of a good Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: for that drawes all other after it. Now to come more particularly to the words, <hi>The answere of a good Conscience:</hi> It would take up all the time to speake of Conscience in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and it were not to much purpose. I will <note place="margin">Good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence what.</note> take it as it serves my purpose at this time. A good conscience in this place, is a Conscience peaceable and gracious, peace and purity make up a good Conscience. To make this clearer, there be three degrees of a good Conscience, (though the last bee here meant especially) There is first a good Conscience that is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, a troubled good Conscience, and then <note place="margin">Three de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of a good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> a pacified good Conscience, and then a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous good Conscience.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="184" facs="tcp:17825:275"/>
A troubled good Conscience is, when the <note place="margin">A troubled good Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> spirit by conviction opens to us what we are in our selves, he opens our sins, and the danger, and soulnesse of our sins: whereupon our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science is terrified, and affrighted. Therefore this good Conscience, whereby we are convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of our estate by nature, in itselfe it is a good Conscience, and tends to good; for it tends to drive us to <hi>Christ.</hi> There is a good Conscience therefore that hath terrour with it.</p>
                  <p>The second degree of a good conscience is that that comes from the other, when we are <note place="margin">2. A peaceable good Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> convinced of sinne, and of the Miserie that coms by sinne, then that good conscience speakes peace to us: when God shines upon the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence by his spirit (from whence there is peace) that is a peaceable good conscience. For <hi>God</hi> takes this course, after he hath terrified consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence by his spirit and word, then he offers in the Gospell, (and not onely offers but) commands us to beleeve; he offers all good in <hi>Christ,</hi> and commands us, &amp; not only so, but invites us: <hi>Come unto me all ye that are wearie, &amp;c.</hi> Nay, he beseech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us: <hi>We beseech you to be reconciled;</hi> he takes all courses. Now his spirit going with these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties, he perswades the soule that he is our gracious Father in <hi>Christ Iesus. Christ</hi> hath suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered such great things, and he is <hi>God,</hi> and man, he is willing, and able to save us. Considering, he is annoynted of <hi>God</hi> for this purpose: here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon conscience is satisfied, and doth willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yeeld to these gracious promises, it yeelds to
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:17825:275"/>
this command of beleeving, to these sweet invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings. This is a peaceable good Conscience.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon comes (in the third place) a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious good conscience, which is a conscience <note place="margin">3. A gracious good Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> after we have beleeved, that resolves to please God in all things, as the Apostle saith <hi>Heb. 13. We have a good Conscience studying to please God in</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>all things:</hi> we have a good conscience toward God, and toward men. When the conscience is appeased, and quieted, then it is fit to serve God, as an instrument that is in tune. An instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment out of tune, yeelds nothing but harsh Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sique; so when the soule and conscience is distempered, and not set at peace, it is not gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious. So now you see the order, there is a troubled good conscience, and a peaceable good conscience, and then a gracious heart: forwhile conscience is not at peace, by the blood, and resurrection of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> by considering him, and by application of him, there is no grace nor service of God with that heart: but the heart shuns <hi>God,</hi> it hates <hi>God,</hi> and murmurs against <hi>God;</hi> men thinke why should they doe good deeds when they beleeve not? when they cast not themselves upon <hi>Christ,</hi> and when consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is not sprinkled with the blood of <hi>Christ;</hi> they are able to doe nothing out of the love of <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>whatsoever is not of faith and love, it is sinne.</hi> The heart cannot but be afraid of <hi>God,</hi> and wish there were no <hi>God,</hi> and murmur, and repine till it be pacified. That is the reason why the Apostles in the latter part of their Epistles,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:17825:276"/>
they presse conscience of good duties, when they had taught Christians before, and stabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed them in <hi>Christ,</hi> because all duties issue from faith, if they come not thence they are nothing: if there be first faith in <hi>Christ;</hi> then there will be a good conscience in our lives and conversations.</p>
                  <p>And from the gracious conscience comes the increase of a peaceable conscience: there must be peace, before we can graciously renew our Covenants to please God: but when we have both these, faith in <hi>Christ,</hi> and a resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to please God in all things, there comes an increase of peace: for then there is an argument to satisfie conscience, when first of all consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence goes to <hi>Christ,</hi> to the foundation. I have answered Gods command, I have beleeved, and cast my selfe upon <hi>Christ;</hi> I have answered Gods promise, he hath promised, if I doe so; he will give me <hi>Christ</hi> with all his Benefits; I have yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the obedience of faith: hereupon comes some comfort, here is the foundation of this obedience: But then when Conscience like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise from this resolves to please God in all things, in the duties to God, and man, hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on comes another increase of peace, when I looke to the life of grace in my owne heart. For a working, carefull Christian hath a double <note place="margin">Double ground of comfort.</note> ground of comfort. One in the command to beleeve and in the promise, whether he hath evidences of grace or no; but when he hath power by the spirit to lead a godly life, and to keepe a
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:17825:276"/>
good conscience in all things, then he hath comfort from the evidence of grace in his owne heart, from whence an increase of peace comes. You see what a good conscience is here in this place, the answer of a good conscience, I will not speake largely of it. To come a little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the point. How know we that a man <note place="margin">Quest.</note> hath a good conscience, a peaceable good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, when it is troubled? For here is the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie, a conscience is never so peaceable, and gracious, but there is a principle of rebellion in us, the flesh that casts in doubtings, and stirres up objections: as indeed our flesh is full of objections against Gods divine truth, there be seeds of infidelitie to every promise, and of rebellion to every command in the word. How shall a man know that hee hath a peaceable good Conscience in the middest of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion? <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> How to know a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science though troubled.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let him looke if the conscience answer God in the middest of opposition, and rebellion: my flesh and blood saith thus, my sins are great, and Sathan layes it hard to my charge: yet <note place="margin">1. If it answer God in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> notwithstanding, because God hath promised, and commanded, I cast my selfe upon God. Let us aske our owne hearts and consciences what they say to God, what is the answere to God. Wee see what <hi>Iob</hi> saith, <hi>Though he kill me, yet I will trust in him:</hi> flesh and blood would have shewed its part in <hi>Iob,</hi> as if God had neither respected nor loved him: yet when <hi>Iob</hi> recovered himselfe; <hi>Though hee</hi>
                     <pb n="188" facs="tcp:17825:277"/>
                     <hi>kill me, I will trust in him.</hi> So a man may know, though conscience be somewhat troubled, yet it is a gracious peaceable conscience, if peace get the upper hand, and grace subdue corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when the conscience so farre as it is enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by Gods spirit, can check it selfe. <hi>Why art thou disquieted oh my soule?</hi> why art thou troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led? <hi>trust in God,</hi> trust in God reconciled now in <hi>Christ,</hi> when conscience can lay a charge upon it selfe, and check it selfe thus, it is a signe that conscience hath made this gracious answer.</p>
                  <p>Againe, one may know, though conscience <note place="margin">2. By allowing Gods truth.</note> be troubled somewhat, yet it is a gracious peaceable conscience, when it alwayes allowes of the truth of <hi>God</hi> in the inward man. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever the flesh say, the word is good, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement is good, the promise is good; as St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>I allow the law of God in my inward man,</hi> by this a man may know, (though his peace be somewhat troubled, that yet notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) there is the answer of a good conscience.</p>
                  <p>Againe, when a man can breake out of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <note place="margin">3. By acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Gods goodnesse:</note> and such an estate, as the Divell weakens our faith by, (for he useth the troubles of the Church, and our owne troubles, to shake our faith, as if <hi>God</hi> did not regard us: now) when conscience can rise out of this, as in <hi>Psal.</hi> 73. <note place="margin">Psal. 73.</note> 
                     <hi>Yet God is good to Israel; yet my soule keepe silence to the Lord:</hi> though things seeme to goe contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to a man, as if God were not reconciled, as if he had not part in <hi>Christ, Yet my soule keepe si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and God is good to Israel.</hi> This conflict
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:17825:277"/>
shews that there is a gracious part in the soule, and that conscience is a gracious conscience, It is said here, it is <hi>the answer of a good conscience</hi>
                     <q>Towards God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>For conscience indeed hath reference to <hi>God,</hi> and that will answer another question: (for conscience as it performes holie duties, as it is a gracious conscience, it lookes to <hi>God)</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Quest.</note> may a man know, or how shall he know that he doth things of conscience? whether he be in the state of grace and doth things graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously? He may, for why, is conscience set in <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> A man may know when he doth things graciously.</note> man, but to tell him, what he doth, with what mind he doth it, in what state he is; this is a power of the soule, which conscience shewes. A man may know what estate he is in, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he performe things graciously or no: Now how shall a man know whether he doth things <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> How to know what we doe from a good Conscience.</note> of conscience or no?</p>
                  <p>First whatsoever the answer of conscience is, it is towards God: if a man doe things from reasons of Religion; if a man be charitable to his neighbour, if he be just, and good, if it be <note place="margin">1. It answeres towards God.</note> from reasons of Religion, because God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands him, this is a good conscience. A good conscience respects God, and his command. What we doe for company or for custome, is not from a good conscience: A good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence doth things from God, with reasons from God, because he commands it, it is <hi>Gods</hi> depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in our hearts.</p>
                  <p>Againe, what we doe from a good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:17825:278"/>
we doe from the inward man, from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward principle, from the inward judgement, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <note place="margin">2. From an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note> we thinke it is so, and from an inward af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. When we have not a right judgement of what we doe, and doe it not out of love, and from the inward man, we doe it not out of a good conscience: what is done out of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, is done from the inner man. Therefore in all our performances let us examine our selves, not what we doe, but upon what ground we doe it, in conscience to God, to obey him in all things. I cannot dwell upon these things.</p>
                  <p>The answer of a good conscience that saves us, together with Baptisme, when there is the answer of a good conscience, then Baptisme seales salvation. To come more neere to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer of a good conscience in Baptisme.</p>
                  <p>You will object, if the answer of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, <note place="margin">Object.</note> in Baptisme doe all, and not the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward washing of the body, why are Children Baptised then, they cannot make the answer of a good conscience?</p>
                  <p>I answer, the place must be understood of <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> Why Children are Baptised.</note> those of yeares of discretion; For infants that dye in their infancie, we have a double ground of comfort concerning them. First they are within the Covenant, have they not received the seale of the Covenant, which is Baptisme? And how-ever, they actually answer not the Covenant of grace, by actuall beleeving: yet they have the seed of beleeving, the spirit of <hi>God</hi> in them, and God doth comprehend them
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:17825:278"/>
by his mercie being not able to comprehend him, nay we that are at yeares of discretion are saved by Gods comprehending, and imbracing us; we are comprehended of him, as the Child is of the nurse, or of the Mother. The Child holds <note place="margin">Simile.</note> the nurse, and the nurse the Child, the Child is more safe from falling by the nurse, and the Mothers holding of it, then by its holding of them. Those that are at yeares must claspe and graspe about <hi>Christ,</hi> but <hi>Christ</hi> holds and comprehends them; much more doth <hi>God</hi> comprehend those that are Children, that are not able to comprehend him. For those that live to yeares of discretion, their Baptisme is <note place="margin">Baptisme binds when we come to yeares.</note> anngagement, and obligation to them to beleev: because they have undertaken by those that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered for them to beleeve when they come to yeares: and if when they come to yeares, they answer not the Covenant of grace, and the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer of a good conscience, if they doe not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, and renounce Sathan, all is frustrate: their Baptisme doth them no good, if they make not good their Covenant by beleeving and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing. It is spoken therefore of those that are of yeares of discretion: we leave infants to the mercie of God. Those therefore that are at yeares of discretion, must have grace to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer the Covenant of grace by beleeving, and renouncing. To come therefore to our selves.</p>
                  <p>We that will answer to the Covenant made in baptism, must perform it, especially that that we then Covenanted, what was that? we answered
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:17825:279"/>
that we would beleeve, doest thou beleeve? I <note place="margin">Covenant in Baptisme.</note> beleeve every Article of the faith: and doe you renounce the Devill, and all his works? I doe. Therefore unlesse now we beleeve in <hi>Christ,</hi> and renounce the Devill, we renounce our Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, it doth us no good. There are diverse kinds of people that overthrow their owne Baptisme.</p>
                  <p>Those that live in sins against conscience they doe renounce their baptisme (in some sort) <note place="margin">Those that live in sins against Conscience, renounce their Baptisme.</note> those that feed their corruptions: for in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme we are consecrated in soule and body to God, we are given up to him, <hi>we are not our owne,</hi> his name is called on us, we are called Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, therefore our eyes are not our owne, our hands are not our owne, our thoughts and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections are not our owne: there must be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing, and a denyall of all sinne: as farre as it is contrary to <hi>Christs</hi> spirit. Those therefore that labour to feed their corruptions, what doe they else so farre but renounce their baptisme, and under the Livery of <hi>Christ</hi> serve the enemie of <hi>Christ;</hi> the Devill, that they should renounce? Those that feed their eies with seeing of vanity, and their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>ares with filthy discourse: those that suffer their feet to carrie them to places where they infect their soules; those that instead of renouncing their corruptions feed them, and their hearts tell them they cherish those corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they should renounce by baptisme, what shall we think of these? and yet they think to be saved by <hi>Christ.</hi> God is mercifull, and <hi>Christ</hi>
                     <pb n="193" facs="tcp:17825:279"/>
died, when they live in a continuall renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of baptisme.</p>
                  <p>For a use therefore of exhortation, if so be that this be the effectuall baptisme, the chiefe <note place="margin">Exhortation to get this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer of a good Conscience.</note> thing that we ought to stand on, this answer of a good conscience; then I beseech you let us all labour for this eccho, for this answer, <hi>when God saith, seeke yee my face,</hi> to answer, <hi>thy face Lord will I seeke.</hi> When he saith, <hi>I will be your God,</hi> to answer, <hi>we will be thy people,</hi> when he saith, in the Ministery <hi>beleeve,</hi> to answer, <hi>Lord I beleeve, helpe</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Marke 9.</note> 
                     <hi>my unbeliefe;</hi> let us labour to eccho, this holie eccho is the answer in the Covenant of grace.</p>
                  <p>This answer of our faith, is set downe in Scripture, alway when it speaks of the estate of those that are in the Covenant of grace, it is mentioned on our part, that we take God for our God, and <hi>Christ</hi> for our <hi>Christ; My beloved is</hi>

                     <hi>mine, and I am my beloveds,</hi> there is a mutuall owning of both sides. Therefore if we would an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer the Covenant of grace, let us worke our hearts to answer, when we heare in the Ministry, and in the Covenant of grace answer, Lord I desire to beleeve this. And when there is any thing commanded, let our hearts answer; and desire God to bow our inward man to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that we may be plyable. Let us labour to have that free spirit, that holy <hi>David</hi> prayes for, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. That was stopped by reason of his sin: <note place="margin">Psal. 51.</note> for when we renew sins against conscience, we stop the mouth of our prayers, that we cannot goe to God, we stop the mouth
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:17825:280"/>
of conscience that we cannot goe boldlie to <hi>God:</hi> therefore he had then lost that freedome of spirit. Let us labour to be plyable to the spirit, readie to answer <hi>God,</hi> in all that we are exhorted to, and to yeeld the obedience of Faith to all the Promises; that is the state of those that are in the Covenant of Grace, there is the answer of a good Conscience. Therefore let us resolve to take this course, if <note place="margin">How to get the answer of a good Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> we would attaine the answer of a good Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                  <p>First of all labour, that our consciences may be convinced of the ill that is in us, that we may have a good troubled conscience; first, that we may know thorowly what our estate by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is. And then labour (in the second place) to have prace, and then rayse, and renew our purpose to serve God in all things; and to trye the truth of this, let us put interrogatories to our selves, let us aske our selves, doe I beleeve? doe I not daube with my heart? doe I obey? doe I willingly cast my selfe into the mold of Gods word? and willingly obey all that I heare? doe I not deceive my selfe? let us propound these interrogatories. <hi>God is greater then our conscience,</hi> if we answer God with reservations, I will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer God in this, and not in this, I will yeeld to religion as farre as it may stand with my owne lusts, and advantage: this is not the answer of a good conscience. What is done to God, must be done all, what is done zealously and religiously hath respect to all
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:17825:280"/>
                     <hi>Gods Commandements,</hi> and promises to one thing as well as an another. If our hearts tell us, there are reservations from false grounds, here is not <hi>the answer of a good conscience.</hi> Therefore let us search our selves, and propound questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to our selves, whether we beleeve, and obey or no, and from what ground wee doe it. <note place="margin">To make use of our Baptism</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>And let us make use of our Baptisme upon all occasions, as thus, Satan hath two wayes of tempting; One is, he tempts to sinne, and then <note place="margin">1. Against temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to sin.</note> he tempts for sinne, to accuse our consciences to make a breach betweene <hi>God,</hi> and us, that we dare not looke upon God: when he tempts us, or our corruptions move us, or the world by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements would draw us to any sinne, let us thinke of our Baptisme, and the answer we have made there, and make use of it, is this agreeable to the promise I made? surely I have renounced this, shall I overthrow my owne promise? I make conscience to make good my promise to men, and shall I breake with God? I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to God to renounce the flesh, the world, and the Divell; to renounce all these corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Let us have these thoughts when we are so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited to sinne, when proud nature would have us set up the banner of pride. I have renounced these proud affections: I shall overthrow my baptisme if I yeeld. And so for the enlarging of our estates, or for getting up to honour to please mens humours, to breake the peace of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science: these things we have renounced, the world, and the vanities of it in our Baptisme.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="196" facs="tcp:17825:281"/>
The life of many, is nothing but a breach of their vow, and Covenant in Baptisme. How will they looke at the houre of death, and the day of judgement, that <hi>God</hi> should keepe his promise with them to give them life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting, when they never had grace to keepe touch with him; notwithstanding, their ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in Baptisme and their so often repeating it at the Communion, and their renewing of their vowes when they have beene sick? How can we looke for performance on <hi>Gods</hi> part, when we have not had grace to performe our part, but our whole life, hath beene a satisfying of our base lusts? Let us make that use in temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to sinne, let us fetch arguments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst sinne from our Baptisme, from the answer that we made then: for we must make good now that that was made then, or else it is in vaine.</p>
                  <p>Againe, when we are solicited by Satan to <note place="margin">2. In temptations to discourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> be discouraged, let us consider that we are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised <hi>in the name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the Holy-Ghost;</hi> and consider, that the promise is made whensoever we repent, without any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pection of time, nay though we have broke with <hi>God:</hi> (for Satan will use that as a chiefe wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, thou hast fallen, thou hast fallen) yet as it is <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> 3. Though a man will not <note place="margin">Ier. 3.</note> take his wife after a breach; yet God tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends us, hee is God, and not man: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore after breaches if wee yet answer his command and his promise: (for the command
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:17825:281"/>
of beleeving is upon us while we live,) if we beleeve, and <hi>confesse our sins we shall have mercie,</hi> if we come, &amp; cast our selves upon <hi>Christ.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore after relapses, let not Satan abuse them to make us despaire. Baptisme is a seale of our faith, and faith is enjoyned us all the dayes of our life, all this time of life, is a time of grace, and we are commanded to repent, and beleeve. Let not Satan therefore discourage us after sinne; let us goe to our Baptisme, it is a seale to us of faith, and repentance, whensoever we beleeve, and repent.</p>
                  <p>When we are solicited to distrust in God <note place="margin">2. To distrust.</note> for the things of this life any way, as if God ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not for us, let us consider, that we have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, that <hi>we beleeve in God the Father Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi> therefore he is our Father, he knowes what is good for us, and he loves us: he is an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God, it is an article of our faith that we have answered to, let us make it good upon all temptations in that kind. Dothnot God care for us? he had an Arke for <hi>Noah</hi> in the worst times, when the flood overwhelmed the whole World: So if there be the answer of a good Conscience, he will have an Arke for his <hi>Noah's,</hi> to save, and protect, and defend us, he is a <hi>Father Almightie.</hi> Let us know the grounds of our Religion, the Articles of our Faith, the grounds and foundation of our Faith: let us consider the good things promised there; and consider withall, that wee have all ingaged our selves to beleeve
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:17825:282"/>
those things, and to make use of our faith up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all occasions. Those that cannot read, if they have no other, let them looke on these two Bookes, the Booke of their Baptisme, and the Booke of conscience, they would be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to instruct them: some people pretend Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance; consider what thou art Baptised to, the grounds of Religion: consider there what thou hast renounced, consider in particular whether this thing that thou art moved to, be Gods, or the Divells command, and answer Satan, and thy lusts by not answering of them: give them their answer, and tell them, a good conscience must answer Gods command, and promise: but they must have their answer by denyall, by this answer of a good conscience. Those that cannot read, and are not learned, let them make use of the learning of their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme. There is a world of instruction, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, a treasurie of it in Baptisme. I dare be bold to say, if any Christian when he is temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to any sinne, to despaire or discouragement, if he consider what a sollemne promise he hath made to God in Baptisme, it would be a meanes to strengthen his Faith, and to arme him against all temptations. There is no man sinnes, but there is a breach with God first in wronging the promise hee hath ingaged himselfe to in Baptisme. Wee all that are heere have beene Baptised, let us learne to make more Conscience of this Blessed Sacrament then wee have done, and
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:17825:282"/>
let us labour to have the answer of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science at all times.</p>
                  <p>What a comfort is it when our hearts and Consciences makes a gracious answer to God, <note place="margin">Comfort from the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer of a good Conscience.</note> in believing and obeying? and in renouncing all Gods and our enemies? What a comfort is such a Conscience? It will uphold us in sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, in death, and at the day of judgement, in all ill times in this life. A Conscience that hath answered God by believing his promises and hath renewed the Covenant to obey God in all things, what a wondrous peace hath it? Let the Devill object what he can, let our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing hearts object what they can, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding if it bee a renewed sanctified Conscience, it can; out of the privity of its owne act, say, I have believed, I have cast my selfe upon Gods mercy in Christ, I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced these motions and suggestions, and courses: and though I bee overcome with temptations, yet I heartily hate them. What a comfort is this?</p>
                  <p>Conscience; it is either the greatest friend, or the greatest enemy in the world. It is the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest friend when it is privy to it selfe of this resolute answer: that it hath obeyed God in all things; then Conscience is our friend, it speakes to God for us at all times. Then againe at the houre of death, what a comfort it is, that we have this answer of a good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, especially at the day of judgement, when we can looke God in the face: a sincere heart,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:17825:283"/>
a Conscience that hath laboured to obey the Gospell, and to keepe Covenant with God, it can looke God in the face: for what in the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace goes for perfect obedience, but sincerity, and truth? God requires that: when the heart can say with <hi>Hezekias, Lord thou knowest that I have walked perfectly before thee.</hi> Lord I have believed, and laboured to expresse it in my life and conversation, though with much weakenesse, yet in truth. This sincerity will make us looke God in the face, in the hour of death, and at the day of judgement, and in all troubles in this life.</p>
                  <p>A Christian that hath the answer of a good Conscience, hee hath Christ to be his Arke in all deluges. Christ saves us not only from hell, and damnation, but in all the miseries of this life. If any thing come upon us for the breach of Gods Covenant: as God threatneth, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26, <hi>to send warre and famine &amp;c.</hi> For the breach of his Covenant: what a comfort is it then for <note place="margin">Levit. 26.</note> such as have kept the Covenant? For then God hath an arke for such in ill times: for every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance in evill times, it comes from the same ground as the deliverance from hell doth: why doth God deliver me from hell and damnation? because he loves me in Christ, and that moves him to deliver me in evill times, if I keepe a good Conscience: and that love that gives mee Heaven, gives me the comforts of this life, if I labour to have this answer the Apostle speakes of, what a comfort is this in the worst times?</p>

                     <pb n="201" facs="tcp:17825:283"/>
Those that live in Rebellion, and make no Conscience of their vowes and covenants to God (that they have made and repeated oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and renewed in taking of the Lords Supper) but goe on still in their sinnes; alas, what comfort can such as these have? how can they look for an answer from God: if any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise that hee hath made, when their lives are rebellious, their conscience tels them that their lives doe not witnesse for God, in keeping co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with him, but they rebell against him? their hearts tell them they cannot look to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for comfort; they carry a hell in their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, a guilty Conscience, they doe not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to be purged by the blood of Christ, nor labour for the spirit of God to sanctifie them, in renewing them to holy obedience to God. Those that have their conscience thus stained, especially that purpose to live in sin, they can looke for nothing but vengeance from God. It is not knowne now, who are the wisest peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: In the times of trouble, and at the houre of death, at such times it will be knowne that they are the wisest people that have made Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of keeping their Covenant with God: of renewing their Covenant with God, first, in all things that they would serve him better, and then, when they have renewed their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants with God, (as we have cause now indeed, if ever, to renew them, when wee are warned by publike dangers, or when wee have cause to take occasion to renew our Covenants that
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:17825:284"/>
we made with God in Baptisme, to bind our Consciences to closer obedience, and those that have renewed their Covenant, and have grace to keepe it, those are wise people. Wee see in the current of Scripture, in dangerous times there was still renewing of their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants with God. And those that God delights in, he puts his spirit into them, that they shall be able by the helpe of his spirit, to keep their Covenant in some comfortable measure, and those God will chuse and marke out in the worst times.</p>

men, especially <hi>David</hi> (who was the pen-man of most of them) speakes to God, wherein we have the passages of a broken humble soule to God. Among the rest, in this Psalme, <hi>David</hi> layes open varietie of passions. His conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at this time was such, as that he was an exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led man, from his owne house, and his owne friends, and which grieved him worst of all, from the Tabernacle, the house of God. It was upon the occasion of <hi>Saules</hi> persecution, or of <hi>Absaloms</hi> his sonne: but I take it rather of <hi>Sauls</hi> that hunted him as a partrich in the wildernes. Hereupon you have a discovery, how this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man of God stood affected with this case and condition of his. First hee layes open his griefe, his griefe ariseth from his desire: hee that loves most, and desireth most, he alwayes grieves most: and all other affections have their scantling from love, which is the first borne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the soule. Therefore before he layes, out his griefe, he sets out his desire to the house of God: the want whereof grieved him most of all. <hi>As the Hart panteth after the water brooks; so panteth my soule after thee Oh God.</hi> As the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Hart panteth after water, so the soule thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth for God, for the living God, <hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Then after his desire, he layes forth his grief, <hi>My teares have bin my meat day and night, while they continually say unto me, where is thy God?</hi> Grievances never come alone, but as <hi>Iobs</hi> Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers, they come one after another, even to
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:17825:286"/>
Gods Children, when he is disposed to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them, they are multiplyed: therefore here is not only a griefe of want, that he was debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of those sweet comforts which hee had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the Tabernacle, but here is likewise a griefe from the reproach of his enemies, that tooke occasion from his disconsolate estate, to upbraid him, <hi>Where is thy God? My teares have bin my meat day and night, while they continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally say unto me, where is thy God?</hi> He dissolves the cloude of his griefe, into the showr of teares: <hi>my teares have bin my meat.</hi> They were so plentifull, that they did feed his soule as it were.</p>
                  <p>Then he sets downe another ground of his grief, from the remembrance of his former hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse: as usually that doth make the griefe raw, and more sensible: for <hi>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to aggravate his griefe, oh (saith he) when I remember what comfort I had formerly in the house of God, I poure out my soule.

God, and lead a goodly traine to the house of God. The picture of a good Magistrate, and a good master of a family, hee goes not alone to the house of God, but hee leads his traine, he is attended on by his servants. <hi>David</hi> went not alone into the house of God, but with the multitude, <hi>with the voyce of them that kept holiday.</hi> Well, hee had griefe enough, his heart was full of griefe. Now in the next verse he takes <note place="margin">Verse 5.</note> up his soule, and expostulates with himselfe, <hi>why are thou so sad oh my soule, and why are thou disquieted in me? hope thou in God, for I shall yet praise him for the helpe of his countenance.</hi> So you see here, he is not so flat in his griefe, that he gives over-long way to it, but hee even fals a chiding of his soule: <hi>why art thou cast downe oh my soule, why art thou disquieted within me?</hi> oh! but yet griefe will not be so stilled: affliction is not quelled at the first, nor griefe stilled and stayed at the first, therefore it gathers upon him againe in the next verse, <hi>Oh my God, my soule is cast downe within me, when I remember thee from the Land of Iordan, and of the Hermonites, from the hill Missar:</hi> When I remember thee from these places, my soule is cast downe againe, and my afflictions are multiplyed. Though he had fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenout with his soule, before, for his impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. <hi>One deepe cals to another,</hi> deepe cals upon deepe <hi>at the noyse of the water-spouts.</hi> Hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares afflictions to water spouts, as it is in scripture, <hi>All thy waves and billowes have gone over me;</hi> even as one deepe cals to another, so one
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:17825:288"/>
affliction cals to another. Then when hee had given a little way again to his griefe, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to God, he takes up his soule another time: yet (saith he) <hi>the Lord will command his loving kindnesse in the day time, and in the night, his song shall be with me, and I will pray to the God of my life.</hi> He presents to himselfe the goodnesse of God, to comfort his soule. And he presents to him in the next verse, his owne resolution. I <hi>will say to God</hi> (for the time to come) <hi>my rocke, why hast thou forgotten me? and why goe I mourning, for the oppression of the enemy?</hi> So here he stayes his soule once againe: he presents to his soule the loving kindnesse of God, with renewing his resolution to seeke God: an effectuall way to stay the soule, by considering Gods love, and mercy, and by renewing our resolutions and purposes, to cleave to God. <hi>I will say to God, my rocke, why hast thou forgotten me?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I but here is a third assault of griefe again: for there is a spring of corruption in us, and such a principle in us, as will yield murmurings, and discontent againe and againe: therefore in the verse I have read to you, he comes againe to complaine, <hi>As with a sword in my bones mine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies reproach me, while they say unto me daily, where is thy God.</hi> He had complained once of this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but it had a fresh working with his thoughts againe. <hi>As with a sword in my bones &amp;c.</hi> Hereupon, he is forced the third time to expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stulate, and to fall out with his soule: <hi>Why art thou cast downe oh my soule, and why are thou dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted?</hi>
                     <pb n="210" facs="tcp:17825:289"/>
                     <hi>hope thou in God, for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God.</hi> He comes to his former remedy, he had stilled his griefe once before with the same meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and upbraiding of his owne soule, and chiding himselfe: but he comes to it here as a <hi>probatum est,</hi> as a tryed remedy, he takes up his soule very short, <hi>Why art thou so cast downe oh my soule, Why art thou disquieted within me?</hi> You see how <hi>Davids</hi> passions here are interlaced with comforts, and his comforts with passions, til at last he gets the victory of his owne heart. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, neither sin, nor griefe for sin are stilled, and quieted at the first. You have some short spirited Christians, if all be not quiet at the first, all is lost with them: but it is not so with a true Christian soule, with the best soule li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; it was not so with <hi>David,</hi> when hee was in distemper, he checks himselfe: the distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per was not yet stilled, he checks himselfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, then the distemper breaks out againe, then he checks himselfe againe, and all little enough to bring his soule to a holy, blessed, quiet temper, to that blessed tranquillity &amp; rest that the soule should be in, before it can enjoy its owne happinesse, and enjoy sweet commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God. As you see in Physick; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps one Purge will not carry away the peccant humour, then a second must be added; perhaps that will not doe it, then there must be a third: so when the soule hath beene once checked, perhaps it wil not doe, we must fall to it againe,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:17825:289"/>
goe to God againe: And then it may be there will be breaking out of the griefe and maladie againe; wee must to it againe, and never give over; that is the right temper of a Christian.</p>
                  <p>Before I come to the words, observe in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall this; That a living soule, the soule that is alive in grace, that hath the life of grace quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it, is most sensible of all, in the want of spirituall meanes: As here, the griefe of griefes was (which he begins with) that he was banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Tabernacle.</p>
                  <p>What shall we thinke therefore of those that excommunicate themselves from Gods assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, where there is the Father, Sonne, and Holy-Ghost, all the Trinitie dispensing their bountie, and where the prayers of Gods people meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one (as it were) and bind God? What shall wee thinke of them that preferre their private devotions (as they say) before Gods assemblies? Surely, they are not of <hi>Davids</hi> minde; and it is a shrewd argument, that they never had the life of grace in them yet: for where life is, there will be hunger and thirst; <hi>Acrius urgent quae ad naturam.</hi> It is a true A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorisme, Those things presse upon Nature hardest, that touch upon the necessities of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, rather then those that touch upon delight, We can want delights, but necessities of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture we cannot; therefore hunger and thirst they are such passions as will not be quiet: delicacies and novelties the soule of a hungry man can be content to want, but not spirituall
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:17825:290"/>
food for the soule. We see how famine wrought upon the Patriarchs, it made them goe downe into <hi>Egypt</hi> for food. I note it only by the way, that men may know how to judge of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, when they can very well be content, without a blessed supply of holy meanes. Holy <hi>David,</hi> when the meanes was but darke and obscure, when the Canon was not enlarged, when all was in types and clouds; yet hee felt that comfort in the Tabernacle, and in the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of God, that he could not endure the want of them: but as the Hart brayeth after the Water-brookes, so his soule panted after God. But to come to the words themselves. 
<q>As with a sword in my bones, mine enemies reproach me, when they say unto me dayly, Where is thy God?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here are two things considerable in the words.</p>
                  <p>The carriage, and disposition, and expression of others to <hi>David.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And <hi>Davids</hi> affection towards it, how he was disposed towards it, how he did beare it.</p>
                  <p>For their disposition, they were enemies, <hi>mine enemies, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The expression of it, <hi>They reproach me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The specialty of that expression, how they reproached him, they said unto him, <hi>Where is thy God?</hi> They doe reproach him in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="213" facs="tcp:17825:290"/>
The aggravation of that specialty is, they say, openly to his face, they goe not behind my backe, they esteeme so slightly of me, they say it to my face. And continually too, they are never weary, they say daily, where is thy God? They are enemies, they reproach, they reproach in this, <hi>where is thy God?</hi> and they doe it impudently, and dayly.</p>
                  <p>How doth <hi>David</hi> entertaine this usage? how doth he carry himselfe all this while? he must needs bee sensible of it, and therefore hee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth it in most significant words. Oh saith he, these things were as a <hi>sword in my bones.</hi> There be diverse readings of the words: but we will take them as they are laid downe, being very well, <hi>as with a sword in my bones,</hi> (or as it is in the margine, <hi>As killing in my bones) mine enemies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach me.</hi> It was as killing to him, it did goe to his heart, it cut him to the quicke. As a sword is to the body, and bones, so are their words to my soule: I cannot endure it, it is death to me. It is a most emphaticall manner of expressing, the enemies disposition and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. Thus you have the words unfolded. I will but touch some particulars, those that I thinke most needfull for us to take notice of, I will dwell more upon. <hi>Mine enemies</hi> (saith hee) <hi>reproach me.</hi> 
                     <q>Mine enemies.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There hath beene contrary seedes from the beginning of the World; and will bee while
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:17825:291"/>
Satan is in the world, till he be cast into the <hi>burning Lake,</hi> and be there in perpetuall Chaines adjudged to torment, he will ray se up men alway that shall be of his side. And as long as that grand enemy is, and as long as men are that will be subject to his gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (as alway there will be) he will have a great faction in the world. And by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that he hath a partie in us, the flesh, he will have the greatest partie in the world: the most goe the broad way: so that, 
<q>Gods children <hi>(even</hi> David <hi>himselfe)</hi> shall not want enemies.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mine enemies.</hi> It is strange that he should have enemies, that was so harmelesse a man; that when they were sick, and distressed, he prayed for them, and put on sack-cloath for them, as it is <hi>Psal.</hi> 41. This compassionate sweete natured <note place="margin">Psal. 41.</note> man, yet notwithstanding you see he had ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: and enemies that would discover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to reproach him, and that bitterly, in the bitterest manner, they reproach him in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. It is a large point, if I should give my selfe libertie in it: I doe but touch it.</p>
                  <p>That we may be armed by this observation, against the scandall of opposition, that if we meete with enemies in the world, we should not be much offended at it: grieve we may; but wonder we need not. Was there ever any that did more good then our Saviour <hi>Christ? He went</hi>
                     <pb n="215" facs="tcp:17825:291"/>
                     <hi>about doing good:</hi> He did never a miracle that was harmefull, but onely of the Swine that were drowned in the Sea, and that was their owne fault; but he went about doing all the good he could: yet notwithstanding we see what malicious opposites he had, that that is true of the head must be true in the members. Therefore we should reioyce in our conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to <hi>Christ:</hi> if it be in a good cause that we find enemies, and opposition, <hi>O, imperator &amp;c.</hi> Saith he, O, the Emperour is become a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian; is was a blessed time: oh! but the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill is not made a Christian yet, and he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be made good: for he is in <hi>termino</hi> (as we say) he is in his bounds, his nature is immovea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; he is in Hell in regard of his estate, though he be loose to doe mischiefe: now untill the Devill be good; <hi>Gods</hi> Children shall never want enemies; and he will never be good. Therefore, though there were good Kings, and good Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, over all the world: yet good men shall never want enemies as long as the Devill is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, as long as he hath any thing to dee in the world. Enemies therefore we must looke for, and such enemies as will not conceale their malice neither: for that were something, if they would suffer their malice to boyle, and concoct in their owne hearts, but that will not be, but <hi>out of the abundance of the heart the mouth will speake:</hi> where there is a bad treasurie, there will be a bad vent: therefore we see here, they reproach him; <hi>mine enemies.</hi>

Reproach me.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is the proper expression of malice, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach; and it is that that the nature of man can least indure of all. The nature of man can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure an outward wrong, a losse or a crosse, but a reproach, especially if it be a scornfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, the nature of man is most impatient of. For, there is no man, but he thinks himselfe worthy of some respect: Now a reproachfull scorne shewes a disrespect, and when the nature of man sees it selfe disrespected it growes to tearmes of impatience. There is not the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest man living but he thinkes himselfe worthy of some regard. Therefore I cannot blame <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> even out of the principle of nature, to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected here when they reproached him, and gave him vile termes: <hi>Mine enemies reproach me.</hi> Their tongues were tipt from Hell, and they did but utter that that was in their hearts. If the tongues of wicked men, as St. <hi>Iames</hi> saith, be a a <hi>world of mischeife,</hi> what is the whole man? What is the heart, and tongue, and life, and all of wicked men?</p>
                  <p>Now this reproach of wicked men, it is a grievous persecution: as <hi>Ishmael</hi> persecuted <hi>Isaak</hi> in that manner, as it is <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. taken out of the <note place="margin">Gal. 4.</note> storie in <hi>Genesis.</hi> I will not enter into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon place of reproach; it is but taken by the by here.</p>
                  <p>Onely by the way, let it be a support to us: if
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:17825:293"/>
we be reproachfully used in the world; let us not be much cast downe: it is no credit for a man to doe that that the Devill and his instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments doe; nor it is no discredit for us to suffer that that <hi>David</hi> suffered. Let this satisfie thee, there is not the vilest man living but hath this weapon to serve the Devill with, a reproachfull tongue: he that sits upon the Ale bench, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>akes in the Channell, the basest wretch in the world hath a tongue to serve the Devill with in reproaches. It is no credit for them to doe that that the vilest person in the world can doe; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>and it is no shame for thee to suffer, that that the best man that ever lived did suffer. So much for that; <hi>mine enemies reproach me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But what is the specialtie of this reproach? (to come to that more particularly) <hi>They say unto me?</hi> 
                     <q>Where is thy God?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>They touch him in his Religion. They saw him persecuted by <hi>Saul,</hi> scorned by <hi>Sauls</hi> courtiers; they see him driven up and downe, as a Partridge in the Wildernesse: they saw him banished from the Sanctuarie, destitute of friends; they saw him in this disconsolate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, and they judge by sence and appearance, that they thought he was a man that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded not at all, therefore say they, <hi>where is thy God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gods</hi> children are impatient as farre as they
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:17825:294"/>
are men, of reproaches, but so farre as they are Christian men, they are impatient of reproaches in Religion, <hi>where is now thy God?</hi> They were not such desperate Atheists as to thinke there was no God, to call in question whether there were a God or no, (though indeed they were little better:) but they rather reproach, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid him with his singularity; <hi>where is thy God?</hi> You are one of Gods darlings, you are one that thought no body served God but you, you are one that will goe alone, <hi>your God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So this is an ordinary reproach, an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part for wicked men, to cast at the best peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, especially when they are in miserie: what is become of your profession now? what is become of your forwardnesse, and strictnesse now? what is become of your much reading, and hearing now? and your doing such things now? what is become of your God that you bragged so of, and thought your selves so happie in, as if he had beene no bodies God but yours? We may learn hence the disposition of wicked men; it is a character of a poysonfull cursed disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to upbraid a man with his Religion.</p>
                  <p>But what is the scope? The scope is worse then the words, <hi>where is thy God?</hi> The scope is to shake his faith, and his confidence in God: and this is that that touched him so neerly, while they upbraided him, <hi>where is thy God?</hi> Indeed they had some probability and shew of truth; for now God seemed opposite to him, when he was banished from his house, from that bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:17825:294"/>
communion with him that he had. Their purpose was therefore to shake his faith, and affiance in God, and herein they shewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves right the Children of the Devill, whose scope is to shake the faith, and affiance of <hi>Gods</hi> people, in all his temptations, and by his instruments. For the Devill knowes well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, that as long as God, and the soule joyne together, it is in vaine to trouble any man? therefore he labours to put jealousies to accuse God to man, and man to God. He knowes there is nothing in the world can stand against God; as long as we make God our confidence, all his enterprises are in vaine, his scope is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to shake our affiance in <hi>God, where is thy God?</hi> So he dealt with the head of the Church, our blessed Saviour himselfe, when he came to tempt him, <hi>If thou be the Sonne of God, command these stones to be made bread;</hi> he comes with an <hi>If,</hi> he laboured to shake him in his Sonneship. The Devill since he was divided from God himselfe eternally, is become a spirit of divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he labors to divide the Sonne from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he labors to divide even God the Father from his owne Sonne: <hi>If thou be the Sonne of God.</hi> So he labors to sever Christians from their head <hi>Christ,</hi> subjects from their Princes, and Princes from their subjects, friends from friends, and one from another: he is a spirit of division, <hi>where is thy God?</hi> There was his scope, to breed division, if he could, betweene his heart and God, that he might call <hi>God</hi> into jealousie,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:17825:295"/>
as if he had not regarded him: thou hast taken a great deale of paines in serving thy God, thou seest how he regards thee now, <hi>where is thy God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We should labour to make this use of it, to counter-worke Satan; to strengthen that most of all, that the Devill labours to shake most of all: shall the Devill labour to shake our faith, and affiance in God above all other things, and shall we not labour to strengthen that? Above all things, let us looke to our head; as the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent winds about, and keepes his head. Keepe faith, and keepe all: if faith be safe, all is safe, let us strengthen that, and strengthen all; wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken that, and we weaken all. What cares Satan for other sins that we fall into? he aymes at our assurance, that we may doubt of Gods love, whom we have beene so bold as to sinne against: that is it he aymes at, to make weake faith in the particular acts of sinne we commit. He knowes that sinne naturally breeds doubts, as flesh breed wormes: where sinne is, if it be in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver such a little degree, he knowes it will breed doubt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>, and perplexities, and where they are, he hath that he would have; he labors to hinder that sweet communion that should be betweene the soule, and God: <hi>where is now thy God?</hi> You see wicked men, are the children of the Devill right in this.</p>
                  <p>Againe, they instance here in matter of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion against him. You see how readie wicked, and divelish minded men are, to tread over the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:17825:295"/>
hedge where it is lowest; as the proverbe is, to adde affliction to affliction, especially in that that may touch a man nearest: they could not touch him nearer then in this, <hi>Where is thy God.</hi> They knew it well enough, where is now your Religion: this they thought would anger him to the heart: here is a devilish dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition: you have a terrible Psalme for it, <hi>Psalme</hi> 109. of those that ad affliction to the afflicted, <note place="margin">Psal. 109.</note> 
                     <hi>They are cursed persons.</hi> This is the disposition of wicked men, they have nomercy, malice we say is unsatiable. One would thinke that our Saviour Christ, when he was upon the Crosse, racked there in all his parts, a man exposed to so much misery and scorne as he was, that they should have had pitty upon him; but upon the Crosse, they reproached him, Aha, hee <hi>saved others, himselfe be cannot save; let him come from the Crosse, and we will believe in him.</hi> What abit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Sarchasme was this, that came from hekl it selfe. Nay when he was dead, one would have thought their maliee should have beene buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his body. Malice is ordinarily among men living, not the dead, but when he was dead, <hi>This Impostor said &amp;c.</hi> They laboured to bury his good name, that nothing tending to his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour might remaine of him. Indeed it is the nature of malice to wish the not being of the thing it maliceth; no, not the name. <hi>Let his name perish from the earth.</hi> It was extremity of malice to worke upon this disadvantage: when they see him thus afflicted, to vex him
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:17825:296"/>
with that he was most affected with, <hi>where is thy God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore let those that feele, and feed that divellish disposition in themselves, to insult over Gods people, especially in matters of Religion to vexe them; and when there is a wound already, to make the affliction greater, to adde affliction to affliction, let them iudge of what disposition they are. 
<q>They say unto me.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>You see here another circumstance, <hi>They say unto mee.</hi> They are so impudent, that they are not affraid to reproach him to his face, <hi>they say to him,</hi> as if they would stand to their reproach. This is one circumstance of aggravation: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed malice is very impudent, when it is come to the extremity, I onely observe it, that if we meet with such insolencie of malice, not to be discouraged, it hath bin thus before, and thus it will be to the end of the world.</p>
                  <p>And then they are not wearied, their malice is unwearied; <hi>they say to mee.</hi> 
                     <q>Daily.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Day by day, their malice is fed with a spring, with a malicious heart. A malicious heart, and a slanderous tongue alway goe well toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The Divell that was the first grand slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer, hath communion with a malicious heart,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:17825:296"/>
and he foments malice, and cherisheth that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious poysonfull disposition: and a malicious disposition, never wants malicious words. As one saith, of anger, and furie, it ministreth wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons; so we may say of malice, and hatred, it ministreth words alway, a malicious heart will never want words. They say to me, <hi>daily,</hi> these are but circumstances, but yet they are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what considerable: for they tend to the aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the disconsolate estate of this holie man; that he should meet with such wretched men, that had no pittie at all on him, but say to him dayly, 
<q>Where is now thy God?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>You see then from hence, that God is a God (as the Prophet saith) oft times hiding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, that God vayles himselfe oft times to his children. Not onely from the eyes of wicked men, that they thinke godly men deserted of God: but sometimes from the very sence, and feeling of Gods children themselves, they are in such desertions, that they are faine to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine that God hath hid himselfe, and is as a stranger to them. This is the state of Gods children in this world; though God love them dearely, <hi>as the apple of his eye, and as the signet on his hand:</hi> yet notwithstanding his carriage to them is oft times so strange, that those that looke upon their estate in this world, thinke they are men (as it were) for lorne, and destitute
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:17825:297"/>
of God. And this estate must needs be.</p>
                  <p>Because of necessitie, there must be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie betweene us, and our Saviour, it was so with our Saviour, <hi>my God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> God was never nearer him in all his life then then; and yet he cryes <hi>out; my God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> And as he spake, so the rest thought of him, as if he had beene a man forsaken; and so here they say to this holy man, <hi>where is thy God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore let us lay up this likewise for the strengthening of our faith in the like case, that we be not overmuch discouraged, if God hide himselfe: if others thinke our estates miserable, and our selves thinke our selves so, it is no strange matter; it was thus with <hi>David,</hi> he was so neglected of God, that they thought <hi>God</hi> had cleane forsaken him, <hi>where is thy God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our life is now hid with <hi>Christ,</hi> as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle saith, <hi>Colos.</hi> 3. <hi>We have a blessed, and glorious life,</hi> but it is hid in our head. Even as in winter <note place="margin">Colos. 3.</note> time, the trees have a life, but it is hid in the <note place="margin">Simile.</note> roote; so a Christian hath a blessed condition at all times, but his glory and happinesse is hid in his head; and there is a cloud betweene him, and his happinesse:</p>
                  <p>Therefore let us support our selves with this in all times: was God gone from <hi>David</hi> indeed, when they said, <hi>Where is thy God? Oh, no,</hi> God was as neare <hi>David</hi> now as ever he was, nay rather nearer. God was never nearer <hi>Moses</hi> then when he was sprawling upon the water in that Arke
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:17825:297"/>
they had made for him. He was never nearer <hi>Daniel,</hi> then when he was in the Lyons Den; God came betweene the Lyons teeth, and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel;</hi> and as I said, he was never nearer our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our then when he was on the Crosse. And he was never nearer to <hi>David,</hi> then when they said, <hi>where is thy God?</hi> When trouble is neare, God is never farre off; that is an argument to make God neare, <hi>Lord be not farre off, for trouble is neare.</hi> And extremitie, and danger, and trouble, it is Gods best opportunitie to be with his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, how ever he doe not helpe for the present oft times. <hi>Where is thy God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>David</hi> might rather have said to them, where are your eyes? where is your sight? for God is not only in heaven, but in me. Though <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> was shut from the Sanctuary; yet <hi>Davids</hi> soule was a sanctuary for God: for God is not tyed to a sanctuary made with hands. God hath two Sanctuaries, he hath two heavens: the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of heavens, and a broken spirit, God dwelt in <hi>David</hi> as in his Temple. God was with <hi>David</hi> and in him; and he was never more with him, nor never more in him, then in his greatest af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions: they wanted eyes, he wanted not <hi>God.</hi> Though sometimes God hide himselfe, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the world, but from his owne children, yet he is there, howsoever their sorrow is such, that it dims their sight, as we see in <hi>Hagar,</hi> so that they cannot see him for the present: he sometimes lookes in their face, as we see <hi>Mary,</hi> she could not see <hi>Christ</hi> distinctly, but thought

him to be the Gardiner. There is a kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealement a while in heavenly wisedome, yet notwithstanding, God is with his children al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, and they know it by faith, though not by feeling alwayes. As we know what <hi>Iacoh</hi> said, <hi>God was in this place, and I was not aware;</hi> when he slept upon the stone, and had that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly vision. So it is with Gods people in their trouble, God is with his Church, and children, and wicked men are not aware of it: <hi>Christ</hi> is in them, and they are not aware of it. <hi>Christ</hi> was in the Saints, when <hi>Saul</hi> persecuted them, and <hi>Paul</hi> was not aware of it: <hi>Saul, Saul, why persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test thou me? who art thou Lord?</hi> saith he; alas, he dreamed not of <hi>Christ.</hi> How ever wicked men of the world thinke, yet God is neare his owne children, in the most disconsolate condition that can be. It is (when they say, <hi>where is thy God?)</hi> as if a man should aske what is become of the Moone, betweene the old, and the new, when the darke side is towards us? when we see no Moone at all for a time, till the new come: The Moone is neare, and more enlightned with the Sunne then, then at other times, and is nearer to him. So in affictions, how ever, the darke side of Gods children be toward the world that they cannot see them: yet their light side is towards God, God shines upon them, and enlightens them more then, at that time with solid comfort that keepes them from sinking, then at other times: therefore it was an ignorant question of
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:17825:299"/>
them to aske, <hi>where is thy God?</hi> It shewed they were Ignorant of the passages of Gods dealing with his children, as indeed none are greater Atheists then your scoffers. <hi>Where is thy God?</hi> As if God had beene onely a God of observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to be observed outwardly in all his passages toward his children, whereas, as I said, he is a God hiding himselfe oft times; and he shewes himselfe in contrary conditions most of all, most comfortably: his worke is by contraries. But these carnall men were Ignorant of the mysteries of Religion, and the mysteries of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine providence towards Gods children: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their question savours of their disposition, <hi>where is now thy God?</hi> Thus briefely I have gone over their disposition, and carriage towards the holy man <hi>David.</hi> That they were enemies, of hostile nature, and disposition, &amp; they reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched him, and dayly, and that in his Religion, <hi>where is thy God?</hi>

                  <p>I beseech you let us look to it in time, that it may not be truly said to us, by way of upbrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, <hi>where is now thy God?</hi> God may be strange to us indeed, let us so carry our selves, as that God may owne us in the worst times. If they had said this truly: how grievous had it beene to <hi>David?</hi> but it was more malice then truth.

                     </gap>s greatest extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity upbraid him, and that in truth, <hi>where is your God?</hi> your riches, honour, and estate? where is

all this that you supproted your selfe with, and bore your selfe so big on, that you despised all others? what is become of all now? A man cannot stand in a thing that stands not it selfe.

                  <p>So much for their disposition, and carriage. Now how stands <hi>David</hi> affected with this? that is the second part. 
<q>At with a sword in my bones.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was as a sword to his bones. Now that that toucheth the bones is the most exquisite griefe. That that we call the griefe of the teeth, you see what an exquisite griefe, it is, in that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle member; when the bones are cut or touched, it is a most exquisite griefe: <hi>As with a sword in my bones, my enemies reproach me.</hi> What was the matter that this reproach, <hi>where is thy God?</hi> tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched him so to the quick? what was the cause!</p>
                  <p>The causes were diverse?</p>
                  <p>First of all concerning God: for when they said to him, <hi>Where is thy God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, it tended to the reproach of God, as if God were so fickle a friend, as to desert his best friends in the time of misery; this touched up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God, by way of disparagement, therefore it
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:17825:300"/>
must needs touch <hi>David,</hi> who was <hi>Gods</hi> friend.</p>
                  <p>Then againe it touched God in another thing, in his manner of providence; as if he had <hi>beene a God of the Hills, and not of the Vallies,</hi> as if he had been a God for one time, and not for another, <hi>where is now thy God?</hi> what is become of him?</p>
                  <p>Againe in the third place, it touched upon him in this, as if he had favoured them (being cursed form all hypocrites) more then <hi>David:</hi> as if he had favoured their form all, hypocriticall, base, dead courses, that were most abominable to <hi>God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </hi> for these persecutors were <hi>Sauls</hi> courtiers, and other enemies; wicked men, they thought to justifie their owne wayes by this reproach. You see we are as good as you: God respects us, wee fall not into such miseries, wee have recourse to <hi>Saul,</hi> though he have cast out you, and others &amp;c. So it tended to Gods reproach in that; as if God had justified their course: as if they had been dearer to him, that were most abominable.</p>
                  <p>And this is to make an Idoll of <hi>God,</hi> to make God justifie those courses that he most abhors; <hi>as it is in Psal.</hi> 50. <hi>Thou thoughtest I was like unto thee.</hi> Because <hi>God</hi> lets a wicked man alone, thou thoughtest that I was a companion for thee, and would take thee by the hand, whereas God will not doe so.</p>
                  <p>In these three respects especially, God was wronged, when they said, <hi>where is thy God?</hi> As if thee had n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="223" facs="tcp:17825:301"/>
had not a providence over his children in the worst condition. As if he had allowed, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of the base carriage and condition, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of these wretched men, as well as of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids: where is now thy God?</hi> you see God respects us, as well as you; but there was no such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he respected <hi>David</hi> more then a thousand of them.</p>
                  <p>Againe, this touched upon religion it selfe, this reproach, <hi>where is now thy God?</hi> where is your goodly profession? as if it were in vaine to serve God; a horrible reproach to religion. It is not in vaine altogether to serve the Devill, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowes somewhat upon his servants: this was a base thought, to think that God would do no good to them that serve him, that is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of all good, that doth good to his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, that suffers his <hi>Sun to shine</hi> upon his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: for him to desert his friends, for a man to be truly religious, and to get nothing by it; this tended to the reproach of religion, and through <hi>Davids</hi> sides they strike at God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as if it were <hi>in vaine to serve God,</hi> as they said in <hi>Malachies</hi> time. And indeed this is in the hearts of men now a dayes, if they see a man that makes care and conscience of his wayes under a cloud, or that he doth not so prosper in the world as others doe: they begin to have weake concei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>s of the profession of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as if that were the cause, as if there were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing gotten by serving of God: but we may be loose professors, and goe in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

please God as well as others. This is a great griefe to Gods children; they know well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough it is not invain to serve God, God is not a barren wildernesse to those that serve him: they are not barren ground that are carefull in his service: so you see upon what ground he was thus affected, because God and Religion was touched in it.</p>
                  <p>Take away a godly mans religion, and his God whom he serves in Religion, you take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his life: touch him in that, you touch him in his best free-hold: Therefore when these malicious enemies say, <hi>Where is thy God?</hi> they could not more touch <hi>David</hi> then so. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane men of the world, come and tell them of Religion, and such things, alas they turne it off with scorne; for they would have the world know, that they are not very religious: they never speake of God and of religion, but in scorne, or by way of discourse: but a man that is religious to purpose, and makes it his trade, makes it that whereby hee hopes to bee saved; hee takes to heart any thing that is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken against Religion: their words are <hi>as a sword in his bones,</hi> while they say unto him, <hi>where is thy God?</hi> It is better to bee distempered, then not to be moved, when God and Religion are touched. The Holy-Ghost that appeared in the shape of a Dove, appeared at another time in fiery tongues, to shew that the meeke spirit of God, is zealous other whiles in his children. This was another reason he was thus affected.</p>

                     <pb n="232" facs="tcp:17825:302"/>
And thirdly in this reproach of theirs, thus violent, Where is now thy God? here was a damping of the spirits of all good men in those times, that should heare of this reproach. Words affect strangely; they have a strange force with men, especially in weake fancies, that are not grounded in their judgement and faith. The spies made a shrewd oration, and brought an ill report on the Land: oh! it is a land that devours the inhabitants. It was a speech discomfortable, and it wrought so, that it made them all murmur, and be discouraged. It is not to be thought what mischiefe comes from speech, cunningly handled. This maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous speech, <hi>Where is thy God?</hi> and what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of all thy devotion at the Tabernacle, that thou didst frequent so, and drewest others, a great trayne with thee, what is become of all now? When weake men, that had the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of goodnesse in them, should see a man reproached for this: questionlesse it would dampe the beginnings of goodnesse: oh would not this goe to the heart of <hi>David,</hi> to see inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent men to quench good things in good men with reproaches. Well, wee see what reason the holy man <hi>David</hi> had to bee so sensible of this reproach, for they said unto him daily, <hi>where is thy God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now therefore to make some use of it to our selves: let us enter into our owne soules, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine with what spirits, and feeling wee heare God reproached, and religion reproached and
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:17825:302"/>
hindred, and disgraced any kind of way: if we be not sensible of this, and sensible to the quick, we may suspect wee are not of <hi>Davids</hi> spirit, that was a man after Gods owne heart: It was a cutting of his bones, when they came to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parage his Religion, and profession, and to touch him in that. Shall a man see men forsake Religion, and goe backeward, and desert the cause of God, and see it oppressed, and not be affected with all thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> certainly he hath a dead soule. That which hath no griefe, when there is cause of griefe, certainely it is to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but as dead flesh. That heart is but dead flesh, that is not touched with the sence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
                  <p>And to come a little nearer to our times, when we can heare of the estate of the Church abroad, the poore Church in the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and those places: you see how like a canker, superstition is growne up amongst them: when wee heare of these things, and are not affected, and doe not send up a figh to God, it is a signe wee have hollow and dead hearts. No question but if wee were there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong those malignant spirits that are there, their speeches are daily such, as these wicked mens were to <hi>David,</hi> what is become of your reformation? what is become of your new Religion? where is that now I pray? You that doe upbraid us with Idolatry, what is become of your Religion? no question but they have these <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

and those that have the spirit of God, they are grieved to the heart. If wee have the spirit of God and of Christ in our breasts, and any thing of the spirit of <hi>David,</hi> and of holy men, we will grieve at this.</p>
                  <p>The Apostle St. <hi>Paul,</hi> when <hi>Ely<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>Let us therefore take a tryall of our selves, how we stand affected in case of Religion: He that hath no zeale in him, hath no love: by an <hi>Antiperistasis,</hi> a opposition of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, encreaseth the contrary: if a man have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny goodnesse, if it bee environed with opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it will intend the goodnesse and encrease it. <hi>Lot</hi> shewed his goodnesse in <hi>Sodome</hi> the more, because of the wickednesse of the <hi>Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,</hi> when a man is in vile company, and heares Religion disgraced, and good persons scoffed at, and will not have a word to justifie good causes, and good persons, hee hath no life at all of Religion; for if hee had, he would then have more Religion then ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the contrary would then intend, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease the contrary. There was a blessed mixture of many affections in this griefe
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:17825:303"/>
of the holy man <hi>David,</hi> when hee said, <hi>their words were as a sword in his bones.</hi> There was great griefe, not onely for himselfe, as a man being sensible of reproaches: for men are men, and not out of corrupt nature, but out of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of nature, they are sensible of reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: here was griefe in respect of God, and in respect of himselfe: and here was the love of God, and the love of Religion in this grief. Here was zeale in this, and a sweet mixture of blessed affections, a sweet temper in this, when hee saith, <hi>their words were as a sword in my bones.</hi>

                  <p>Let us make a use of tryall; bring our selves to this patterne, and thinke if wee doe come short of this, then wee come short of that that should bee in us. But especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally let us consider with what hearts wee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine those dolefull and sad reports of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine Churches, and with what consideration, and view, wee looke upon the present estate of the Church, whether we be glad or no. There are many false spirits, that either are not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected at all, or else they are inwardly glad of it: they are of the same disposition, that those cursed <hi>Edomites</hi> were of, <hi>Psalme</hi> 137. <hi>Downe with it, downe with it, even unto the ground:</hi> I hope that there are but few such amongst us here, therefore I will not presse that: But if wee bee dead-hearted, and are not affected with the cause of the Church, let us suspect our selves, and thinke all is not well;
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:17825:304"/>
The fire from Heaven is not kindled in our hearts, our hearts are not yet the Altar, where God hath kindled that heavenly fire, if we can heare Religion disgraced, and good causes goe backward, and not be affected. <hi>Curse yee Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roz:</hi> why? because <hi>they went not out to helpe the Lord.</hi> If those bee cursed that doe not helpe, as they can by their prayers, then surely they are cursed that are dead-hearted, that are not affected at all; that joyne with the persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,, that cry <hi>downe with it even to the ground,</hi> &amp; say Aha, so we would have it. If those be cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed that helpe not forward the cause of the Church, at least by their prayers, and strive and contend for the faith <hi>once given,</hi> what shall we thinke of those that are not affected at all, nay which is worse of all, that hinder good causes, that are scorners of Religion, and good cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, what shall wee thinke of those wretched spirits? how opposite are they to the spirit of <hi>David?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To adde one thing more, wee may learne hence, the extent of the commandements, how to enlarge the commandements. Our Saviour Christ, when he came to preach the Gospell, hee began with the enlargement of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, shewing the spirituall meaning, and extent of the law: <hi>he that calleth his Brother Racha, or foole, is in danger of hell fire: and he that lookes on a woman, to lust after her, hath committed adultery with her in his heart.</hi> You see here the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> when hee speakes of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:17825:304"/>
he speakes of it as if they had a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous intention; and in the event and issue, it is a kind of murther. <hi>As with a sword in my bones my enemies reproach me, &amp;c.</hi> This sword were but words, he is a murtherer in Gods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme, (and so it will prove if hee repent not) that wounds another man with his tongue: for what doth the Holy Ghost here in <hi>David?</hi> doth he not set out words by swords? Is it not oft in the Psalmes, <hi>Their words are as swords; the poyson of Aspes is under their lipps?</hi> There is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent place you have for this in <hi>Prov.</hi> 12. 18. <note place="margin">Prov. 12. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>There is that speakes like the piercing of a sword, but the tongue of the wise is health.</hi> A good man hath a healing tongue, hee hath a medicinall salving tongue, but a wicked man, his words are as swords; and as he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>aith here, their spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king is as the piercing of a sword. Therefore, hence let us learne, not to think our selves free from murther, when we have killed no body, or free from adultery, when wee are free from the grosse act: this is but a pharisaicall glosse upon the commandements, but if wee will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the commandements of God, as they are to bee understood, wee must inlarge them as the Scripture inlargeth them: he that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiceth the life, and comfort of any man, hec is a murtherer of him in Gods esteeme: and he that labours to cut another man to the heart, with sharpe piercing words, in Gods esteeme he is a murtherer. Those that, though among men, they cannot say blacke is their eye, and
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:17825:305"/>
pride themselves, as if they were very religious men, yet notwithstanding they are men that are not wanting of their tongues, men that care not to speake bitterly and sharpely of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: if they did consider of this, it would take them downe, and make them thinke a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle meaner of themselves, when indeed in Gods construction they are little better their mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers. <hi>As with a sword in my bones mine enemies reproach me, while they say to me daily, where is thy God?</hi> So much for these words.</p>
