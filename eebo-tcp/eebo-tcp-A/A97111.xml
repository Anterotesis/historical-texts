            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Plainly manifeſting, That the ſafety and well-being of the Common-wealth under God, dependeth on the fidelity, and ſtedfaſt adherence of the people, to thoſe whom they have choſen, and on their ready compliance with them.
Alſo That the deſtruction and bondage of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth in generall, and of every good minded man in particular cannot be avoided, if the people, through want of conſideration, ſhall give eare to any other counſels or counſellers.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>INCE, (as the Scripture ſpeaketh) no man hateth his own fleſh, but loveth and cheriſheth it; and that naturally, every man ſeeketh his owne good: it is very ſtrange, (ſeeing we have the helpe of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, of experience, of the Word of God) that the right way, which leadeth to that end, ſhould be ſo hard, and difficult to be found, certainly, it cannot be ſo in it ſelf; God hath been more good to man, then to make things neceſſary hard to come by.</p>
            <p>The difficulty will rather be found to ariſe by our own default, from our want of a patient, ſetled, ſerious, and religious conſideration of things, wherby we are continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally liable upon all occaſions to be miſ-led, either by our owne evill and eager deſires, or by the evill examples of others, or by evill (though long ſetled) cuſtomes; or by the perſwaſions of politique deceivers, into ſuch wayes, which though they ſeeme to be ſtrewed with Roſes and perfumes, yet are the wayes of death, and when we leaſt ſuſpect, bring us to deſtruction.</p>
            <p>Our bleſſed Saviour therefore bids us <hi>to be wiſe as Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents,</hi> becauſe whilſt we live in this world we have to do with Serpents, and to beware of wolves that come to us in ſheepes clothing; To be innocent as doves, is a moſt bleſſed temper of ſpirit; but very unſafe and liable to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:113601:3"/>
ginne, and bird of prey, if the wiſdome of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent be not joyned there with: Now all the helps of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, of experience or the word of God, produce not this wiſdom without conſideration; adviſed, deliberate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, (ſuch as few in this Nation are accuſtomed unto) without which that which is called knowledg or underſtanding, is not true knowledge nor underſtanding, ſerving to no publique uſe at all, except to diſtract and diſtemper, and vex and deſtroy a Nation. It is the voyce of God himſelfe: <hi>my People will not conſider, they they will not underſtand,</hi> without conſideration it is impoſſible to underſtand any thing as we ought, &amp; without underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding (true conſiderate underſtanding) man is like unto the beaſts that periſh: nor had this Nation ever been thus mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable as it hath bin, is, and is like to be, but for want of this kind of conſideration, in the People; ſo that it may be as truly ſaid of this, as of the perverſ, raſh, inconſiderat Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Iewes; thy diſtruction is of thy ſelf O England. And if ever there were a cauſe to ſtudy &amp; put in practice the wiſdom of the Serpent: to beware of foxes that come to us in ſheeps clothing: if ever there were a time requiring the uttermoſt of wiſdom and conſideration in all ſorts of people, rich and poore, high and low, one with another; now there is a cauſe, now is the time.</p>
            <p>For never to this day, were thoſe who are truſted with the care of the Common-wealth, ſo beſet and ſurrounded with difficulties; with unexpected appearances of ſtrange thinges, ſuch as no age can parralell, of ſo high and great concernment, as the leaſt miſcarriage therein, may in a moment of time make void all their long, their faithfull and painefull endevours, and involve us all into the moſt miſſerable bondage, that ever over-whelmed any People.</p>
            <p>And theefore (however any ſort of men may delude
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:113601:3"/>
themſelves) if we doe not all joyntly and unanimouſly (laying aſide all diſaffection for differences in Judgment in Religion) patiently, ſetledly and ſeriouſly, deliberate and conſider what every one of us ought to doe, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to their preſervation; abandoning all paſſion, and willfull proſecution of perverſe and prepoſterous things: all jarring and repining at their proceedings; this Nation cannot be ſafe or happy, nay cannot but be miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and wretched.</p>
            <p>For the greateſt and moſt ſuperlative freedome, of this Nation (and wherin the ſafty and well-being thereof doth reſide) conſiſteth in this; That Lawes cannot bee made, Government (<hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> or <hi>Civill</hi>) cannot be eſtabliſhed or Altered: Warre cannot bee levied, nor Peace concluded, nor Monyes raiſed, nor any thing done; but by the Authority of thoſe whom the PEO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PLE themſelves doe chuſe for PARLIAMENT: and entruſt as their Commiſſioners, with full and compleat power for Their good. Had it not been by this juſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, We had never been Freed, from the Tyranies, oppreſſions and cruelties of the High Commiſſion, Star-Chamber, and Councel-board: from the burthenous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of Forreſt-law, Court of Honor, Commiſſions of Waſte: from the Extortions, and Exorbitances, in the Courts of juſtice, Chancery, Requeſts: from Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>money (for remiſſion wherof, no leſſe then Twelve Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidies were required) and from all thoſe other innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Patents, Projects, Illegall warrants, and Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: Things which the whole Land long groned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; though (now removed) the benefit be unworthily forgotten, or miſ-attributed to an Act of grace. Had it not been for this Authority; the Court of Wards had
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:113601:4"/>
never been aboliſhed, that for many Ages hath oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Land.</p>
            <p>Had not this Authority, oppoſed; the KING had been furniſhed with monyes to have Warred upon our Brethren of SCOTLAND, in his firſt attempt upon that Nation. This Authority, in the worſt of all former Times, when the ſtrongeſt Force and Power was upon them, ever ſtuck cloſeſt to the intereſt of the People, nor did the People, in the worſt of Times, ever forſake them, but maintained Their power, and Priveledges, their Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and authority, whenſoever they called upon them for helpe and aſſiſtance, nor hath this juſt and powerfull Authority been more true to the Commons that choſe them, then to thoſe worthy Lords and Patriots, that at any time have aſſiſted them for the common good of the Nation, preſerving their Honours with as true affection as the liberties of the People; no man can name the time that (intentionally) this Authority ever did injury to any juſt intreſt either at home or abroad, but have borne and ſuffered much, from thoſe that have made an ill uſe of their lenity and credulity.</p>
            <p>All which is neceſſary to be remembred, and ſeriouſly conſidered in this inſtant of time, becauſe if theſe things be ſeriouſly laid to heart, it may happily expel thoſe poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous vapors, with which our ayre begins to be infected, we have ageneration of forgetfull, ingratefull people, who becauſe the Parliament cannot yeild unto all they deſire, (without extreame thraldom to the people, in things Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall and Civill) are degenerate into a malevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent diſpoſition, murmuring and repining at all their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, and making hard conſtructions of their juſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devours; and by politique and ſubtill meanes, labour to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:113601:4"/>
alienate the hearts of their friends from them, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline them to give eare to other Connſels, laying open their infimities (which they ſhould rather goe backward to cover) and would (if they could) poſſeſſe the world that there is a ſort of men that would ſettle Religion more purely, performe and interpret the Covenant more exactly, and doe juſtice more ſpeedily, and more ſinceare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then this juſt Authority, whom the people themſelves have choſen; nay, there are fames abroad, that there are catalogues taken of any thing that may poſſibly beare a bad or ſiniſter conſtruction, to be ſhewed to the people, in the day of their extremity, if ſuch a day can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured.</p>
            <p>And for what end all this? Why, you ſhall not faile to be told it is for the glory of GOD, the ſetting up of the Kingdome of JESUS CHRIST, and the everlaſting Good of the ſoules of the people, and the like: but take yee heed how yee heare or give credit to theſe <hi>Syren</hi> ſongs; theſe charmes of DALILAH, are but to deprive SAMPSON of his ſtrength, to rob the people of their Power: It is a ſad proverb, but Court Logick hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it ſo frequently true, that it may be related without ſuſpition of blaſphemy, <hi>In nomine Domini incipit omne malum;</hi> When the Devill transformes himſelfe into an Angell of light, to make his deluſion currant, he is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated to uſe ſuch language: For which cauſe our bleſſed SAVIOUR adviſeth us to be <hi>Wiſe as Serpents,</hi> leſt wee bee beguiled by their ſubtill gloſing diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.</p>
            <p>But as the Apoſtle ſaith in anoth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

of light, of ſtrength, of powers, or dominations, ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devour, by any meanes whatſoever, to divide you from thoſe you have choſen, either in affection, or aſſiſtance, you are to hold them for the moſt accurſed Traitors that ever trode upon Engliſh ground, and to uſe all lawfull meanes to bring them to condigne puniſhment; being well aſſured, that whatſoever is pretended; the intent can be no other then to extirpate for ever the foundation of the freedom and ſafety of the People: which once done, a ready way is made for any thing that can make a people wretched and miſerable, without hope of remedy.</p>
            <p>And therefore be adviſed in time, before you are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged too farre, and be confident, thoſe inconveniences you have fancyed to your ſelves (and wherein you are like enough to be miſtaken) if they ſhould indeed prove reall ones, yet were you better to have patience, and by loving diſcourſes and prudent meanes endevour to worke a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter information, (which time may produce, as by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in your ſelves you cannot but know) rather then through impatience and violent importunity, to caſt your ſelves upon a remedy that muſt neceſſarily beideſtructive to the whole people of the Land: For once ſuppoſe or admit that any (pretending whatſoever, piety or autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity) may more properly judge of law (or religion ſo far as concerns the publick) or give interpretation of oaths or covenants, or treaties, or tranſactions, or any thing which is of publick concernment, then thoſe whom the people have choſen: and farewel common freedom for ever, who ever thoſe are you would ſo prefer, as far as in you is, in ſo admitting or ſuppoſing, you betray the great freedome of the Nation, and ſet Maſters over the Parliament, then which there can be no greater Treaſon.</p>

            <p>And, as a ſure teſtimony of their faithfulneſſe and ſinceritie; doe but ſeriouſly conſider, how excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly God hath bleſſed them, <hi>viz.</hi> with the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the people, with power and ſtrength in the field, with deliverance from many moſt deſperate Plots, and out of many ſore and difficult exigents, that their enemies have bin as Chaffe before their Armies: What force hath beene too mightie, or place too ſtrong for their Achievement? And now, that they have all, as it were, in their owne command (by the ſame good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God) would you now, becauſe they cannot pleaſe you in every particular, except they ſhall goe againſt their owne Conſciences, gladly ſee them trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den upon and brought under: Surely, if you would but open your eyes, you could not but ſee, that the hand of God is ſtill with them, and will not be ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: He hath already brought low the mightie, and reproved, vanquiſhed even Kings for their ſakes, and for theirs whom they repreſent: And doe you now thinke, that any ſhall be able to lay their honour in the duſt? You cannot certainly be many, that have beene thus blinded, or deluded: Nor can you poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly long continue in ſo bad a mind. A little conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration muſt neceſſarily change your minds, and God I truſt, will prevent you with his converting grace, and will not ſuffer you to be tempted above your pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. How-ever, this is moſt viſible to all conſiderate men, that there are multitudes of honeſt Religious peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,

that remain immaculate in their affections to this Honourable Parliament, &amp; are truly thankful for their unwearied labors, in recovery of the long loſt Liberties of this great Nation, &amp; ſtand firmly reſolved to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and defend with their lives and eſtates, their juſt power and priviledges, againſt all oppoſition, circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, or deluſion whatſoever; And thoſe who ſhall ceaſe to doe this, through any conceived cauſe or provocation, they ſhall eſteeme them the moſt treacherous upon earth, and not worthy the name of true <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> or Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>This, by generall diſcourſe &amp; obſervation, is found to be a knowne truth; and therefore, it is earneſtly hoped, the Honourable Parliament will no whit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate of their reſolutions, to make this Nation abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely free and happie; notwithſtanding the manifold new Diſcoveries of ſtrange Apparitions, if they but pleaſe to conſider ſeriouſly the true <hi>Engliſhmans</hi> tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, they will find, they have multitudes more with them then againſt them; and that in times to come this ſhall be an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proverb, <hi>As certaine to periſh, as thoſe that openly oppoſe, or would ſecretly undermine a Parliament.</hi>
