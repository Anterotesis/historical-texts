            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>The day of her Lanching being appoynted, the Lady <hi>Hawkins</hi> (my Mother in Law) craued the naming of the Ship, which was ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily granted her: who knowing what Voyage was pretended to be vndertaken, named her the <hi>Repentance</hi>: what her thoughts were, was kept secret to her selfe; And although many times I expostula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with her, to declare the reason for giving her that vncouth name, I could never haue any other satisfaction, then that repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance was the safest Ship we could sayle in, to purchase the haven of Heaven. Well, I know, shee was no Prophetesse, though a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and most vertuous Lady, and of a very good vnderstanding.</p>
               <p>Yet too propheticall it fell out by Gods secret Iudgementes, which in his Wisedome was pleased to reveale vnto vs by so vnknowne a way, and was sufficient for the present, to cause me to desist from the Enterprise, and to leaue the Ship to my Father, who willingly tooke her, and paid the entire charge of the building and furnishing of her, which I had concorted or paid. And this I did not for any superstition I haue in names, or for that I thinke them able to further or hinder any thing; for that all immediately dependeth vpon the Providence of Almightie God, and is disposed by him alone.</p>

I caused the Pilot to set Sayle from <hi>Blackwall,</hi> and to <hi>vayle</hi> downe to <hi>Graues-end,</hi> whether that night I purposed to come.</p>
               <p>Having taken my vnhappy last leaue of my Father Sir <hi>Iohn Haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins,</hi> I tooke my Barge, and rowed downe the River, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to <hi>Barking,</hi> wee might see my Ship at an Anchor, in the midst of the Channell, where Ships are not wont to more them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues: this bred in me some alteration. And comming aboord her, one and other began to recant the perill they had past of losse of Ship and goods, which was not little; for the winde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at East North-east, when they set sayle, and vered out Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly; it forced them for the doubling of a point to bring their tacke aboard, and looffing vp; the winde freshing, sodenly the Shipp began to make a little hele; and for that shee was very deepe loaden, and her ports open, the water began to enter in at them; which no bodie having regard vnto,<note place="margin">Note.</note> thinking themselues safe in the River, it augmented in such maner, as the waight of the water began to presse downe the side, more then the winde: At length when it was seene and the shete flowne, shee could hardly be brought vpright. But God was pleased, that with the diligence and travell of the Company, shee was freed of that danger: which may be a gentle warning to all such as take charge of Shipping, even before they set sayle, eyther in River or Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, or other part, to haue an eye to their ports, and to see those shut and callked, which may cause danger; for avoyding the many mishaps, which dayly chance for the neglect thereof, and haue beene most lamentable spectacles and examples vnto vs: Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments in the <hi>great Harry,</hi> Admirall of England, which was over-set and suncke at <hi>Ports-mouth</hi> with her Captaine, <hi>Carew,</hi>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:20492:7"/>
and the most part of his company drowned in a goodly Summers day, with a little flawe of winde; for that her ports were all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, and making a small hele, by them entred their destruction; where if they had beene shut, no wind could haue hurt her, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in that place.</p>
               <p>In the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> Master <hi>Thomas Candish</hi> had a small Ship over-set through the same negligence. And one of the Fleete of Syr <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> in <hi>Santo Domingo</hi> Harbour, turned her keele vpward likewise, vpon the same occasion; with many others, which wee never haue knowledge of.</p>
               <p>And when this commeth to passe, many times negligence is cloaked with the fury of the winde: which is a double fault; for the truth being knowne, others would bee warned to shun the like neglects; for it is a very bad Ship, whose Masts crackt not asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, whose Sayles and tackling flie not in peeces, before shee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-set; especially if shee be English built. And that which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setteth the Ship is the waight of the water, that presseth downe the side, which as it entreth more and more, increaseth the waight, and the impossibilitie of the remedie: For the water not entring, with casing of the sheate, or striking the sayles, or put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Ship before the winde or Sea, or other diligences, as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion is offered (and all expert Mariners know) remedie is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily found.</p>
               <p>With this mischaunce the Mariners were so daunted, that they would not proceede with the Ship any further, except shee were lighted, which indeede was needelesse, for many reasons which I gaue: but Mariners are like to a stiffe necked Horse, which taking the bridle betwixt his teeth, forceth his Rider to what him list ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In fine, seeing no other remedie, I dispat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched that night a servant of mine to giue account to my Father of that which had past, and to bring mee presently some Barke of <hi>London</hi> to goe along with mee to <hi>Plymouth</hi>; which not finding, he brought me a Hoye, in which I loaded some sixe or eight tunns, to giue content to the company; and so set sayle the 13. of Aprill, and the next day wee put in at <hi>Harwich,</hi> for that the winde was contrary, and from thence departed the 18. of the sayd Moneth in the morning.</p>
               <p>When wee were cleere of the Sands, the winde vered to the South-west, and so we were forced to put into <hi>Margat</hi> Roade, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

came presently after vs a Fleete of Hollanders of aboue an hundreth Sayle, bound for <hi>Rochell</hi> to loade salt: and in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie a dozen ships of Warre; their wasters very good ships and well appointed in all respects.

               <p>The next morning the winde vering Easterly, I set sayle, and the Hollanders with me, and they with the flood in hand, went out at the North-sands-head; and I through the <hi>Gulls</hi> to shorten my way, and to set my Pilates shore.</p>
               <p>Comming neere the South-sore-land, the winde began to vere to the South-east and by south, so as we could not double the point of the Land, and being close abourd the shore, and putting our ship to slay, what with the chapping Sea, and what with the Tide vpon the Bowe, shee mist staying, and put vs in some daunger, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee could flact about;<note place="margin">Note.</note> therefore for doubling the point of any land better is ever a short bourd, then to put all in perill.</p>

Whereby I cannot but advise all such, as shall haue charge committed vnto them, ever before they depart out of the Port, to giue vnto their whole Fleete, not onely Directions for civill government, but also where, when, and how to meete, if they should chance to loose compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and the signes how to know one another a-far off, with other poynts and circumstances, as the occasions shall minister matter different, at the discretion of the wise Commander.</p>
               <p>But some one may say vnto me, that in all occasions it is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to giue Directions: for that, if the enemy happen vpon any of the Fleete, or that there be any treacherous person in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, their Designements may be discovered, and so prevented.</p>
               <p>To this I answere, that the prudent Governour, by good conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration may avoyde this, by publication of that which is good and necessarie for the guide of his Fleete and people; by all secret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, to giue them sealed, and not to be opened, but comming to a place appoynted, (after the manner of the Turkish direction to the <hi>Bashawes,</hi> who are their Generalls;) and in any eminent perill to cast them by the boord, or otherwise to make away with them. For he that setteth Sayle, not giving directions in writing to his Fleete, knoweth not if the night or day following, he may be sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from his Company, which happeneth sometimes: and then, if a place of meeting be not knowne, he runneth in danger not to ioyne them together againe.</p>
               <p>And for places of meeting, when seperation happeneth, I am of opinion, to appoynt the place of meeting in such a height, twentie, or thirtie, or fortie Leagues off the Land, or Iland. East, or West, is not so fitting, if the place affoord it, as some sound betwixt Ilands, or some Iland, or Harbour.</p>
               <p>It may be alledged in contradiction, and with probable reason,<note place="margin">Obiections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst meeting in Harbours.</note> that it is not fit for a Fleete to stay in a Harbour for one Ship, nor at an Anchor at an Iland, for being discovered, or for hinderance of their Voyage.</p>
               <p>Yet it is the best; for when the want is but for one or two ships,<note place="margin">Answered,</note> a Pynace or Ship may wayte the time appoynted, and remaine with direction for them.

               <p>Besides there was no losse of reputation, because the French Kings Fleete was in his owne Sea; and therfore for it to come to winde-ward, or the other to goe to lee-ward, was but that, which in reason was required, the Kingdomes being in peace and Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: For every Prince is to bee acknowledged and respected in his iurisdiction, and where hee pretendeth it to be his.</p>
               <p>The French Generall, likewise seemed well to vnderstand what hee had in hand, for though he were farre superiour in forces, yet vsed hee the termes which were required; and comming within speech hayled them, and asked if there were peace or warre be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>twixt <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France:</hi> whereunto answere being made, that they knew of no other but peace; they saluted each other after the maner of the Sea, and then came to an Anchor all together; as and friends visited each other in their ships.</p>
               <p>One thing the French suffered (vpon what occasion or ground I know not) that the English alwayes carried their flag displayed; which in all other partes and Kingdomes is not permitted; at least in our Seas,<note place="margin">The English carry vp their flagg in the French Seas.</note> if a Stranger Fleete meete with any of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties ships, the forraigners are bound to take in their flags, or his Maiesties ships to force them to it, though thereof follow the breach of peace or whatsoever discommodity.

               <p>Which answere the Generall vnderstanding, presently imbarked himselfe in the same Boat, and came to the <hi>Iesus of Lubecke,</hi> and craved licence to speake with my Father: which at the first was

Wherevnto the <hi>Spanish</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall replyed, that he knew not any offence he had committed, and that he would be glad to know, wherein he had mis-behaved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.

               <p>Before we came to the Cape, wee tooke in our Sayles, and made preparation of Hookes and Lines to Fish.

               <p>The Palmito is like to the Date tree,<note place="margin">The <hi>Palmito.</hi>
                  </note> and as I thinke a kinde of it, but wilde. In all parts of <hi>Afrique</hi> and <hi>America</hi> they are found, and in some parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> and in divers parts different. In <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frique,</hi> and in the West <hi>Indies</hi> they are small, that a man may cut

them with a knife, and the lesser the better: But in <hi>Brasill</hi> they are so great, that with difficultie a man can fell them with an Axe, and the greater the better; one foote within the top is profitable, the rest is of no value; and that which is to be eaten is the pith, which in some is better, in some worse.</p>
               <p>The Plantane is a tree found in most parts of <hi>Afrique</hi> and <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The <hi>Plantane.</hi>
                  </note> of which two leaues are sufficient to cover a man from top to toe; It beareth fruit but once, and then dryeth away, and out of his roote sprouteth vp others new. In the top of the tree is his fruit, which groweth in a great bunch, in the forme and fashion of pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, in some more, in some lesse. I haue seene in one bunch aboue foure hundred Plantanes, which haue weighed aboue foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score pound waight. They are of divers proportions, some great, some lesser, some round, some square, some triangle, most ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily of a spanne long, with a thicke skinne, that peeleth easily from the meate; which is either white or yellow, and very tender like Butter; but no Conserue is better, nor of a more pleasing taste. For I never haue seene any man, to whom they haue bred mis-like, or done hurt with eating much of them, as of other fruites.</p>
               <p>The best are those which ripen naturally on the tree, but in most partes they cut them off in braunches, and hange them vp in their houses, and eate them as they ripe. For the Birds and Vermine presently in ripning on the tree, are feeding on them. The best that I haue seene are in <hi>Brasill,</hi> in an Iland called <hi>Placentia,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Platentia.</hi>
                  </note> which are small, and round, and greene when they are ripe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereas the others in ripning become yellow. Those of the West <hi>Indies</hi> and <hi>Guynne</hi> are great, and one of them sufficient to satisfie a man; the onely fault they haue is, that they are windie. In some places they eate them in stead of bread, as in <hi>Panama,</hi> and other parts of <hi>Tierra firme.</hi> They grow and prosper best when their rootes are ever co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with water; they are excellent in Conserue, and good sodden in different manners, and dried on the tree, not inferior to Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kett.</p>

It hath two shells, the vttermost framed (as it were) of a multitude of threeds, one layd vpon another, with a greene skinne over-lapping them, which is soft and thicke; The innermost is like to the shell of a Hazell nutt in all proportion, saving that it is greater and thicker, and some, more blacker. In the toppe of it is the forme of a Munkies face, with two eyes, his nose and a mouth. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth in it both meate and drinke; the meate white as milke,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:20492:19"/>
and like to that of the kernell of a Nutt, and as good as Almonds blancht, and of great quantitie: The water is cleare, as of the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and pleasing in taste, and somewhat answereth that of the water distilled of Milke. Some say it hath a singular propertie in Nature, for conserving the smoothnesse of the skinne; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Portingall,</hi> the curious Dames doe ordinarily wash their faces and neckes with it. If the holes of the shell be kept close, they keepe foure or six moneths good, and more; but if it be opened, and the water kept in the shell, in few dayes it turneth to Vineger.</p>
               <p>They grow vpon high Trees, which haue no boughes; onely in the top they haue a great cap of leaues, and vnder them groweth the fruite vpon certaine twigs; And some affirme that they beare not fruite, before they be aboue fortie yeares old, they are in all things like to the Palme trees, and grow in many partes of <hi>Asia, Afrique,</hi> and <hi>America.</hi> The shels of these nuts are much esteemed for drinking cups, and much cost and labour is bestowed vpon them in carving, graving and garnishing them, with silver, gold and precious stones.</p>
               <p>In the Kingdome of <hi>Chile</hi> and in <hi>Brosill,</hi> is another kinde of these, which they call Coquillos, as wee may interpret (little Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cos) and are as big as Wal-nuts; but round and smooth, and grow in great clusters: the trees in forme are all one, and the meate in the nut better, but they haue no water.</p>
               <p>Another kinde of great Cocos groweth in the <hi>Andes</hi> of <hi>Peru,</hi> which haue not the delicate meate nor drinke, which the others haue, but within are full of Almonds, which are placed as the graines in the Pomegrannet, being three times bigger then those of <hi>Europe,</hi> and are much like them in tast.</p>
               <p>In these Ilands are Cyvet-Cats,<note place="margin">Cyvet-Catts.</note> which are also found in parts of <hi>Asia,</hi> and <hi>Afrique</hi>; esteemed for the Civet they yeelde, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry about them in a cod in their hinder parts, which is taken from them by force.</p>
               <p>In them also are store of Monkies,<note place="margin">Munkeyes.</note> and the best proportioned that I haue seene; and Parrots,<note place="margin">Parrots.</note> but of colour different to those of the west <hi>Indies</hi>; for they are of a russet or gray colour and great speakers.</p>

Wherevnto they made answere, that all the lynes in our Shippes could not fetch ground: for wee could not be lesse then threescore and tenne Leagues off the Coast, which all that kept reckoning in the Ship agreed vpon, and my selfe was of the same opinion. And so wee applyed our selues to serue God, but all the time that the service endured, my heart could not be at rest, and still me thought the water began to waxe whiter and whiter.

By which plainly we saw, that the currant did set East next of any thing. Whether this currant runneth ever one way, or doth alter, and how, we could by no meanes vnderstand, but tract of

time and observation will discover this, as it hath done of many others in sundry Seas.</p>
               <p>The currant that setteth betwixt <hi>New-found-land</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth also East and West, and long time deceived many, and made some to count the way longer, and others shorter, according as the passage was speedie or slowe; not knowing that the furtherance or hinderance of the currant, was cause of the speeding or slowing of the way. And in sea Cardes I haue seene difference of aboue thirtie Leagues betwixt the Iland <hi>Tercera,</hi> and the Mayne.

               <p>In <hi>Brasill</hi> and the <hi>South Sea,</hi> the currant likewise is changeable, but it runneth ever alongst the Coast, accompanying the winde: and it is an infallible rule, that twelue or twentie foure houres (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Wind alters) the currant begins to change.</p>
               <p>In the West <hi>Indies</hi> onely the currant runneth continually one way, and setteth alongst the Coast from the Equinoctiall lyne to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the North. No man hath yet found that these courrants keepe any certaine time, or run so many dayes, or moneths, one way as another, as doth the course of ebbing and flowing, well knowne in all Seas: onely neere the shore they haue small force; partly, because of the reflux which the coast causeth, and partly for the ebbing and slowing, which more or lesse is generall in most seas.</p>
               <p>When the currant runneth North or South, it is easily disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by augmenting or diminishing the height, but how to know the setting of the currant from East to West in the mayne Sea, is difficult, and as yet, I haue not knowne any man, or read any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour, that hath prescribed any certaine meane or way to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it. But experience teacheth that in the mayne Sea, for the most part it is variable; and therefore the best and safest rule to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the danger, (which the vncertainty and ignorance heereof may cause) is carefull and continuall watch by day and night, and vpon the East and west course ever to bee before the shipp, and to vse the meanes possible to know the errour, by the rules which newe Authours may teach: beating off and on, sometimes to the west-wards, sometimes to the East-wards, with a fayre gale of winde.</p>

It bringeth with it a great desire to drinke, and causeth a generall swelling of all parts of the body, especially, of the legs and gums, and many times the teeth fall out of the iawes without paine.</p>
               <p>The signes to know this disease in the beginning are divers,<note place="margin">The signes.</note> by the swelling of the gummes, by denting of the flesh of the leggs with a mans finger, the pit remayning without filling vp in a good space: Others, show it with their lasinesse, Others, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of the cricke of the backe, &amp;c. all which, are for the most part, certaine tokens of infection.</p>
               <p>The cause of this sicknes,<note place="margin">The cause.</note> some attribute to sloath; some to conceite; and divers men speake diversly: that which I haue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served is, that our Nation is more subiect vnto it, then any other; because being bred in a temperate Clymate, where the naturall heate restrayned, giveth strength to the stomacke, sustayning it with meates of good nourishment, and that in an wholsome ayre, whereas comming into the hot Countries, (where that naturall heate is dispersed through the whole body, which was wont to be proper to the stomacke; and the meates for the most part, preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with Salt, and its substance thereby diminished, and many times corrupted) greater force for digestion is now required, then in times past; but the stomacke <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

other members be strong and sound, if the Stomacke be opprest, or squemish, all the body is vnlustie, and vnfit for any thing, and yeeldeth to nothing so readily, as to sloathfulnes, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the common answere to all questions: As, will you eate? will you sleepe? will you walke? will you play? The answere is, I haue no stomacke: which is as much, as to say, no not willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, thereby confirming that without a sound and whole stomacke, nothing can bee well accomplished, nor any sustenance well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested.</p>

                  </gap>irmitie, which in long Voyages can hardly be avoyded: but if it may be, it is to be shunned; for, the water of the Sea to mans body is very vnwholsome. The corruption of the victuals,<note place="margin">Corruption of victuall.</note> and especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the bread, is very pernicious; the vapours and ayre of the Sea also is nothing profitable,<note place="margin">Vapours of the Sea.</note> especially, in these hot Countries, where are many calmes. And were it not for the moving of the Sea by the force of windes, tydes, and currants, it would corrupt all the world.</p>
               <p>The experience I saw in Anno 1590. lying with a Fleete of her Maiesties ships about the Ilands of the <hi>Azores</hi> almost six moneths;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Azores.</hi>
                  </note> the greatest part of the time we were becalmed: with which all the Sea became so replenished with severall sorts of gellyes, and formes of Serpents, Adders, and Snakes, as seemed wonderfull: some greene, some blacke, some yellow, some white, some of divers cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours; and many of them had life, and some there were a yard and halfe, and two yards long; which had I not seene, I could hardly haue beleeved. And hereof are witnesses all the Companies of the Ships which were then present; so that hardly a man could draw a Buckett of water cleere of some corruption. In which Voyage, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end thereof, many of every Ship, (saving of the <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereli,</hi> which was vnder my charge, and had onely one man sicke in all the Voyage) fell sicke of this disease, and began to die apace, but that the speedie passage into our Country was remedie to the crazed, and a Preservatiue for those that were not touched. The best prevention for this disease (in my iudgement) is to keepe cleane the Shippe,<note place="margin">The remedies;</note> to be sprinkle her ordinarily with Vineger, or to burne Tarre, and some sweet savours, to feed vpon as few salt Meats in the hot Country as may be, and especially to shunne all kindes of salt Fish,<note place="margin">By dyet.</note> and to reserue them for the cold Climates, and not to dresse any meat with salt water, nor to suffer the companie to wash their Shirts nor Cloathes in it, nor to sleepe in their Cloaths when they are wett. For this cause it is necessarily required, that
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:20492:22"/>
provision be made of apparell for the Company, that they may haue wherewith to shift themselues.<note place="margin">By shift.</note> Being a common calamitie amongst the ordinary sort of Mariners, to spend their thrift on the shore, and to bring to Sea no more Cloaths then they haue backes; for the bodie of man is not refreshed with any thing more, then with shifting cleane Cloaths; a great preservatiue of health in hott Countries.</p>
               <p>The second Antidote is,<note place="margin">By labour.</note> to keepe the companie occupied in some bodily exercise of worke, of agilitie, of pastimes, of dauncing, of vse of Armes; these helpeth much to banish this infirmitie. Thirdly, In the morning at discharge of the watch,<note place="margin">By early ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and drinking.</note> to giue every man a bit of bread, and a draught of drinke, either Beere, or Wine mingled with water (at the least, the one halfe) or a quantitie min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with Beere, that the pores of the bodie may be full, when the vapours of the Sea ascend vp.</p>
               <p>The morning draught should be ever of the best, and choysest of that in the ship. Pure wine I hold to be more hurtfull, then the other is profitable. In this, others will be of a contrary opinion, but I thinke partiall. If not, then leaue I the remedies thereof to those Physitions and Surgeons who haue experience. And I wish that some learned man would write of it, for it is the plague of the Sea, and the spoyle of Mariners; doubtlesse, it would be a meritorious Worke with God and man, and most beneficiall for our Countrie, for in twentie yeares, since that I haue vsed the Sea, I dare take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, to giue accompt of ten thousand men consumed with this disease.</p>
               <p>That which I haue seene most fruitfull for this sicknesse, is sower Oranges and Lemmons, and a water which amongst others (for my particular provision) I carryed to the Sea, called Doctor <hi>Stevens</hi> his Water,<note place="margin">By sower O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranges and Lemmons. By Doctor <hi>Stevens</hi> water.</note> of which, for that his vertue was not then well knowne vnto me, I carryed but little, and it tooke end quickly, but gaue health to those that vsed it.</p>
               <p>The oyle of Vitry is beneficiall for this disease;<note place="margin">By oyle of Vitry.</note> taking two drops of it, and mingled in a draught of water, with a little Sugar. It taketh away the thirst, and helpeth to clense and comfort the stomacke: But the principall of all, is the ayre of the Land; for, the Sea is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall for fishes, and the Land for men.<note place="margin">By the ayre of the land.</note> And the oftner a man can haue his people to land, (not hindering his voyage) the better it is, and the profitablest course that he can take to refresh them.</p>

Day and night we had continually a fayre gale of winde, and a smooth Sea, without any alteration; one day, the Carpenters having Calked the Decke of our Shippe,<note place="margin">Dangers of Fire.</note> which the Sunne with his extreame heate had opened, craved licence to heate a little Pitch in the Cook-roome:<note place="margin">By heating of Pitch.</note> which I would not consent vnto by any meanes; for that my Cook-roomes were vnder the Decke, knowing the danger; vntill the Master vndertooke, that no danger should come thereof. But he recommended the charge to another, who had a better name, then experience. He suffered the Pitch to rise, and to runne into the fire, which caused so furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a flame, as amazed him, and forced all to flie his heate; one of my Company, with a double payre of Gloues tooke off the Pitch-pot, but the fire forced him to let slip his hold-fast, before he could set it on the Hearth, and so overturned it, and as the Pitch began to runne, so the fire to enlarge it selfe, that in a moment a great part of the Shippe was on a light fire. I being in my Cabin, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently imagined what the matter was, and for all the hast I could make, before I came, the fire was aboue the Decke: for remedie whereof, I commanded all my Companie, to cast their Rugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gownes into the Sea, with Ropes fastened vnto them. These I had provided for my people to watch in; for in many hott Countries the nights are fresh and colde; and devided one Gowne to two men, a Starboord and a Larboord man; so that he which watched had ever the Gowne: for they which watched not, were either in their Cabins, or vnder the Decke, and so needed them not. The Gownes being well soked, every man that could, tooke one, and assaulted the fire; and although some were singed, others scalded, and many burned, God was pleased that the fire was quenched, which I thought impossible; And doubtlesse, I never saw my selfe in greater perill in all the dayes of my life. Let all men take exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by vs, not to suffer (in any case) Pitch to be heate in the Ship, except it be with a shott heate in the fire, which cannot breed daunger: nor to permit fire to be kindled, but vpon meere necessitie; for the inconvenience thereof (is for the most part) remedilesse.</p>

               <p>Great care is to be had also in cleaving of Wood, in Hooping or Scutling of Caske,<note place="margin">By Hooping and Scutling of Caske.</note> and in any businesse where violence is to be vsed with instruments of Iron, Steele, or Stone; and especially, in opening of Powder, these are not to be vsed, but Mallets of Wood; for many mischances happen beyond all expectation.</p>
               <p>I haue beene credibly enformed by divers persons, that comming out of the <hi>Indies,</hi> with Scutling a Butt of water, the water hath taken fire, and flamed vp, and put all in hazard: And a servant of mine, <hi>Thomas Gray</hi> told me, that in the Shippe wherein he came out of the <hi>Indies,</hi> Anno 1600. there happened the like; and that if with Mantles they had not smoothered the fire, they had bin all burned with a Pipe of Water, which in Scutling tooke fire.</p>

For mine owne part, I am of opinion, that some waters haue this propertie, and especially such as haue their passage by Mines of Brimstone, or other Mineralls, which (as all men know) giue extraordinary properties vnto the waters by which they runne: Or it may be that the water being in wine Caske, and kept close, may retayne an extraordinary proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Wine. Yea, I haue drunke Fountaine, and River waters many times, which haue had a savour as that of Brimstone.</p>

And therefore for the curious, I will spend some time in Declaration of them.</p>
               <p>Ordinarily such Ships as Navigate betweene the <hi>Tropiques,</hi> are accompanied with three sorts of Fish; The <hi>Dolphin,</hi> which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> call <hi>Dozado:</hi> The <hi>Bonito,</hi> or Spanish Makerell: and the <hi>Sharke,</hi> alias <hi>Tiberune.</hi>

He is of the coulour of the Rayn-bow, and his head different to other Fishes; for, from his mouth halfe a spanne it goeth straight vpright, as the head of a Wherry, or the Cut-water of a Ship. He is very good meate if he be in season, but the best part of him, is his head, which is great. They are some bigger, some lesser; the greatest that I haue seene, might be some foure foote long.</p>
               <p>I hold it not without some ground, that the auncient Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers write, that they be <hi>enamoured</hi> of a man: for in meeting with Shipping, they accompany them till they approach to colde Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates; this I haue noted divers times. For disembarking out of the West <hi>Indies,</hi> Anno 1583. within three or foure dayes after, we mett a Scole of them, which left vs not till we came to the Ilands of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zores,</hi> nere a thousand Leagues. At other times I haue noted the like.</p>
               <p>But some may say, that in the Sea are many Scoles of this kinde of Fish, and how can a man know if they were the same?</p>
               <p>Who may be thus satisfied, that every day in the morning, which is the time that they approach neerest the Ship, we should see foure, fiue, and more, which had (as it were) our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For if those which had received so bad entertainment of vs would not forsake vs, much lesse those which we had not hurt; yet that which makes them most in loue with Ships and Men, are the scrappes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing they gather from them.</p>

Of them there are two sorts; the one is this which I haue described; the other, so great, as hardly one man can lift him; At such times as wee haue taken of these, one sufficed for a meale for all my company. These, from the fynne of the tayle forwards haue vpon the chyne seven small yellow hillockes, close one to another.</p>

They are also caught with Hookes and Lynes, the Hooke being bayted with a redd Cloth, or with a white Cloth, made into the forme of a Fish, and sowed vpon the Hooke.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sharke</hi> or <hi>Tiberune,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Sharke.</note> is a Fish like vnto those which wee call Dogge-fishes, but that he is farre greater. I haue seene of them eight or nine foote long; his head is flatt and broad, and his mouth in the middle, vnderneath, as that of the Seate; and he cannot byte of the bayte before him, but by making a halfe turne; and then he helpeth himselfe with his tayle, which serveth him in stead of a Rudder. His skinne is rough (like to the Fish which we call, a rough Hound) and russet, with reddish spottes, saving that vnder the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he is all white: he is much hated of Sea-faring men, who haue a certaine foolish superstition with them, and say, that the Ship hath seldome good successe, that is much accompanied with them.</p>
               <p>It is the most ravenous Fish knowne in the Sea; for he swallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all that he findeth.

They spawne not, as the greatest part of Fishes doe, but Whelpe, as the Dogge or Wolfe; and for many dayes after that shee hath whelped every night, and towards any storme, or any danger which may threaten them hurt, the Damme receiveth her Whelpes in at her mouth, and preserveth them, till they be able to shift for themselues. I haue seene them goe in and out, being more then a foote and halfe long; and after, taking the Damme, we haue found her young ones in her belly.</p>
               <p>Every day my Company tooke more or lesse of them, not for that they did eate of them (for they are not held wholesome; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Spaniards, as I haue seene, doe eate them) but to recreate themselues, and in revenge of the iniuries received by them; for they liue long, and suffer much after they bee taken, before they dye.</p>

In catching two together, they bound them tayle to tayle, and so set them a swimming; another, with his belly slit, and his bowels hanging out, which his fellowes would haue every one a snatch at; with other infinite inventions to entertayne the time, and to avenge themselues; for that they deprived them of swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and fed on their flesh being dead: they are taken with har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Irons, and with great hookes made of purpose, with Swy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels and Chaines; for no lyne, nor small rope can hold them, which they share not asunder.</p>

They flie best with a side wind, but longer then their wings be wett, they cannot sustaine the waight of their bodies; and so the greatest flight that I haue seene them make, hath not beene aboue a quarter of a myle.

               <p>Now of the fight betwixt the Whale and his contraries;<note place="margin">The fight of the Whale,</note> which are the Sword fish and the Thresher. The Whale is of the greatest fishes in the Sea; and to count but the truth, vnlesse dayly experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence did witnesse the relation, it might seeme incredible, hee is a huge vnwildlie fish, and to those which haue not seene of them, it might seeme strange, that other fishes should master him; but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it is, that many times the Thresher, and Sword fish, meeting him ioyntly, doe make an end of him.</p>
               <p>The Sword fish is not great,<note place="margin">with the Sword-fish,</note> but strongly made, and in the top of his chine (as a man may say) betwixt the necke and shoulders, he hath a maner of Sword in substance, like vnto a bone of foure or fiue ynches broad, and aboue three foote long, full of prickles of either side, it is but thin, for the greatest that I haue seene, hath not beene aboue a finger thicke.</p>

They fight in this maner; the Sword fish pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth himselfe vnder the belly of the Whale, and the Thresher vpon the Ryme of the water, and with his tayle thresheth vpon the head of the Whale, till hee force him to giue way, which the Sword fish perceiving, receiveth him vpon his sword, and wounding him in the belly forceth him to mount vp againe: (besides that, he cannot abide long vnder water, but must of force rise vpp to breath) and when in such maner they torment him, that the sight is sometimes heard aboue three leagues distance, and I dare affirme, that I haue heard the blowes of the Thresher two leagues off, as the report of a peece of Ordinance, the Whales roaring being heard much far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It also happeneth sundry times, that a great part of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Sea round about them, with the blood of the Whale changeth his colour. The best remedy the Whale hath in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie to helpe himselfe, is to get him to land, which hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureth as soone as hee discoverth his adversaries, and getting the shore, there can fight but one with him, and for either of them hand to hand, he is too good. The Whale is a fish not good to be eaten, hee is almost all fat, but esteemed for his trayne: and many goe to the <hi>New-found-land; Greene-land,</hi> and other parts onely to fish for them, which is in this maner; when they which seeke the Whale
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:20492:27"/>
discover him, they compasse him round about with Pynaces or Shalops.<note place="margin">The taking of the Whale.</note> In the head of every Boat is placed a man, with a harping Iron, and a long Lyne, the one end of it fastned to the harping iron, and the other end to the head of the Boat; In which it lyeth finely coyled; and for that he cannot keepe long vnder water, he sheweth which way he goeth, when rising neere any of the Boats, within reach, he that is neerest, darteth his harping Iron at him. The Whale finding himselfe to be wounded, swimmeth to the bottome, and draweth the Pynace after him; which the Fisher men present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forsake, casting themselues into the Sea; for that many times he draweth the Boat vnder water: those that are next, procure to take them vp. For this cause all such as goe for that kinde of Fishing, are experimented in swimming. When one harping Iron is fastned in the Whale, it is easily discerned which way he directeth his course; and so ere long they fasten another, and another in him. When he hath three or foure Boats dragging after him; with their waight, his bleeding, and fury, he becommeth so over-mastred, that the rest of the Pynaces with their presence and terror, driue him to the place where they would haue him, nature instigating him to covet the shore.</p>
               <p>Being once hurt, there is little need to force him to land. Once on the shore, they presently cut great peeces of him, and in great Cauldrons seeth them. The vppermost in the Cauldrons is the fatt, which they skimme off, and put it into Hogsheads and Pipes. This is that they call Whales oyle, or Traine oyle, accompted the best sort of Traine oyle. It is hard to be beleeved, what quantitie is gathered of one Whale; Of the tongue, I haue beene enformed, haue many Pipes beene filled.

hearbe, I haue not heard, nor read. It may be surmised, that it is as that of the Becunia, and other Beasts, which breed the Beazer stone;<note place="margin">The Beazar stone.</note> who feeding in the valleyes and mountaines, where are many vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Serpents, and hearbes; when they find themselues touched with any poyson, forthwith they runne for remedie to an hearbe, which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> call, <hi>Contra yerva,</hi> that is to say, contrary to poyson; which having eaten, they are presently cured: but the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the hearbe converteth it selfe into a medicinable stone; So it may be, that the Whale feeding of many sorts of fishes, and some of them (as is knowne) venemous, when he findeth himselfe touched, with this hearbe he cureth himselfe; and not being able to digest it, nature converteth it into this substance, provoketh it out, or dyeth with it in his belly; and being light, the Sea bringeth it to the Coast.</p>
               <p>All these are imaginations, yet instruments to mooue vs to the glorifying of the great and vniversall Creatour of all, whose secret wisedome, and wonderfull workes, are incomprehensible.</p>
               <p>But the more approved generation of the <hi>Amber greece,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Amber greece.</note> and which carrieth likliest probabilitie is, that it is a liquor which issueth out of certaine Fountaines, in sundry Seas, and being of a light and thicke substance, participating of the ayre, suddenly becommeth hard, as the yellow <hi>Amber,</hi> of which they make Beads; which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so a liquor of a Fountaine in the Germayne Sea: In the bottome it is soft and white, and partaking of the ayre becommeth hard and stonie: Also the Corrall in the Sea is soft, but comming into the ayre, becommeth a stone.</p>
               <p>Those who are of this former opinion, thinke the reason (why the <hi>Amber greece</hi> is sometimes found in the Whale) to be for that he swalloweth it, as other things, which he findeth swimming vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the water; and not able digest it, it remaineth with him till his death.</p>

which nature hath given him two great holes in the toppe of his head, by which every time that he breatheth, he spouteth out a great quantitie of water) the <hi>Indian</hi> forsaketh not his holde, but riseth with him, and thrusteth in a Logg into one of his Spowters, and with the other knocketh it in so fast, that by no meanes the Whale can get it out: That fastned, at another opportunitie, he thrusteth in the second Logg into the other Spowter, and with all the force he can, keepeth it in.</p>
               <p>The Whale not being able to breath, swimmeth presently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shore, and the <hi>Indian</hi> a cock-horse vpon him, which his fellowes discovering, approach to helpe him, and to make an end of him: it serveth them for their foode many dayes after.</p>
               <p>Since the <hi>Spaniards</hi> haue taught them the estimation of Amber greece, they seeke curiously for it, sell it to them, and others, for such things as they best fancie, and most esteeme; which are (as I haue beene enformed) all sortes of edge-tooles, Copper, Glasses, Glasse-beads, red Caps, Shirts, and Pedlery ware.

               <p>In execution whereof, I wrote a letter to the Governour in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, and sent him with it a peece of crymson Velvet, a bolt of fine Holland, with divers other things, as a present; and with it, the Captaine of my ship, who spake a little broken Spanish, giving the Governour to vnderstand, that I was bound to the East <hi>Indies,</hi> to traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique in those parts, and that contrary windes had forced me vpon that Coast: If that hee were pleased to like of it, for the commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties the Countrie yeelded in aboundance, I would exchange that, which they wanted.

In the small Village is ever a Garrison of a hundreth Souldiers, whereof

part assist there continually, and in the white Tower vpon the top of the hill, which commaundeth it.</p>
               <p>Heere my Captaine had good entertainement, and those of the shore received his message and Letter, dispatching it presently to the Governour, who was some three Leagues off in another place: at least, they beare vs so in hand.

For any man that putteth himselfe into the enemies Port, had need of <hi>Argus</hi> eyes, and the wind in a bagge, especially, where the enemie is strong, and the tydes of any force. For, with either ebbe or flood, those who are on the shore, may thrust vpon him inventions of fire; and with swimming, or other devises may cut his Cables. A common practise in all hott Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. The like may be effected with Raffes, Cannoas, Boates or Pynaces, to annoy and assault him; and if this had beene practised against vs, or taken effect, our Shippes must of force haue yeelded themselues; for they had no other people in them but sicke men; but many times opinion and feare preserveth the Shippes, and not the people in them.</p>

               <p>The next day following, we discovered the Ilands, where wee purposed to refresh our selues: They are two, and some call them Saint <hi>Iames</hi> his Ilands, and others, Saint <hi>Annes.</hi>

               <p>All which being well Moored, we presently began to set vp Tents and Booths for our sicke men, to carry them a shore, and to vse our best diligence to cure them. For which intent our three Surgeans, with their servants and adherents, had two Boates to wayte conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually vpon them, to fetch whatsoever was needfull from the Shippes, to procure refreshing, and to Fish, either with Netts, or Hookes, and Lynes. Of these implements wee had in aboundance, and it yeelded vs some refreshing. For the first dayes, the most of those which had health, occupied themselues in romeging our Ship, in bringing a shore of emptie Caske, in filling of them, and in felling and cutting of Wood: which being many workes, and few hands, went slowly forwards.</p>
               <p>Neere these Ilands, are two great Rockes, or small Ilands adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. In them we found great store of young <hi>Gannetts</hi> in their nests,<note place="margin">

               <p>In one of the Ilands, we found <hi>Palmito</hi> trees,<note place="margin">Palmitos.</note> great and high, and in the toppe a certaine fruit like Cocos, but no bigger then a Wall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut. We found also a fruit growing vpon trees in codds, like Beanes, both in the codd, and the fruit. Some of my Company proved of them, and they caused vomits and purging,<note place="margin">Purgatiues.</note> as any medicine taken out of the Apothecaries shop, according to the quantitie received. They haue hudds, as our Beanes, which shaled off, the kernell par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it selfe in two, and in the middle is a thin skinne (like that of an Onion) said to be hurtfull, and to cause exceeding vomits, and therefore to be cast away.</p>

                  <hi>Monardus</hi> writing of the nature and propertie of this fruit, as of others of the <hi>Indies,</hi> for that it is found in other parts, also calleth them <hi>Havas purgativas,</hi>

Thus they are good against Fevers, and to purge grosse humors; against the Collicke, and payne of the ioynts, in taking them a man may not sleepe, but is to vse the dyet vsuall, as in a day of purging.</p>
               <p>One other fruit we found, very pleasant in taste, in fashion of an Artechoque, but lesse; on the outside, of colour redd; within white, and compassed about with prickles; our people called them Prick-peares;<note place="margin">Artechoques, or Prick-Peares.</note> no Conserue is better.

               <p>In these Ilands it heigheth and falleth some fiue or six foot water, and but once in two and twentie houres; as in all this Coast, and in many parts of the West <hi>Indies</hi>; as also in the coast of <hi>Perew</hi> and <hi>Chely</hi> (saving where are great Bayes or indraughts) and there the tydes keepe their ordinary course of twice in foure and twentie houres.</p>
               <p>In the lesser of these Ilands, is a Caue for a small Ship to ride in, Land-lockt, and shee may moore her selfe to the trees of either side: this we called <hi>Palmito</hi> Iland,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Palmito</hi> Iland.</note> for the aboundance it hath of the greater sort of <hi>Palmito</hi> trees, the other hath none at all. A man may goe betwixt the Ilands with his Ship, but the better course is out at one end.</p>
               <p>In these Ilands are many Scorpions, Snakes, and Adders, with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther venemous Vermine. They haue Parotts, and a certaine kinde of fowle like vnto Phesants, somewhat bigger, and seeme to be of their nature. Here we spent aboue a moneth in curing of our sicke men, supplying our wants of Wood and Water, and in other neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary workes. And the tenth of December (all things put in order) we set sayle for <hi>Cape Frio,</hi> having onely six men sicke, with purpose there to set ashore our two Prisoners before named; and anchoring vnder the Cape, we sent our Boat a shore, but they could not finde any convenient place to land them in, and so returned: the Wind being Southerly, and not good to goe on our voyage, we succoured our selues within <hi>Isla Grand,</hi> which lyeth some dozen or foureteene Leagues from the Cape, betwixt the West, and by South and West South-west; the rather to set our Prisoners a shore.</p>
               <p>In the mid way betwixt the Cape and this Iland, lyeth the River <hi>Ienero,</hi>

                  </note> a very good Harbour, fortified with a Garrison, and a place well peopled.

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:20492:34"/>
all the rest desert: on this Iland our Prisoners desired to be put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shore, and promised to send vs some refreshing. Whereto we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descended, and sent them a shore, with two Boates well man'd and armed, who sound few Inhabitants in the Iland; for our people saw not aboue foure or fiue houses, notwithstanding our Boats returned loaden with Plantynes, Pinias, Potatoes, Sugar-canes, and some Hennes. Amongst which they brought a kind of little Plantyne, greene, and round, which were the best of any that I haue seene.</p>
               <p>With our people came a Portingall, who said, that the Iland was his; he seemed to be a <hi>Mistecho,</hi> who are those that are of a Spanish and an <hi>Indian</hi> brood, poorely apparelled and miserable; we feasted him, and gaue him some trisles, and he according to his abilitie answered our courtesie with such as he had.</p>
               <p>The wind continuing contrary, we emptied all the water wee could come by, which we had silled in Saint <hi>Iames</hi> his Iland, and filled our Caske with the water of this <hi>Isla Grand.</hi>

               <p>Heere our Nets profited vs much; for in the sandy Bayes they tooke vs store of fish.

Of this they make two sorts of bread, the one finer, and the other courser, but bake them after one maner.

               <p>The second manner of their drinke, is baking it till it be halfe burned, then they beate it into Powder; and when they will drinke, they mingle a small quantitie of it with water, which giueth a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable good taste.</p>
               <p>The third, and best, is baking it (as aforesaid) and when it is beaten into Powder, to seeth it in water; after that it is well boyled, they let it stand some three or foure dayes, and then drinke it. So, it is much like the Ale which is vsed in <hi>England,</hi> and of that colour and taste.</p>

               <p>And so our forcible businesse being ended, leaving instructions for the <hi>Fancie</hi> our Pynace, (according to appointment) where to finde vs, we inroled them in many folds of Paper, put them into a barrell of an old Musket, and stopped it in such manner as no wett could enter; then placing it an end vpon one of the highest hills, and the most frequented of all the Iland, wee imbarked our selues, and set sayle with the wind at North-west, which could serue vs but to the end of that reach, some dozen leagues long, and some three or foure leagues broad.

               <p>This bay is all sandie, and cleane ground on the Easter part; but before you come at it, there lyeth a poynt of the shore a good byrth off, which is dangerous.

               <p>This Harbour we called <hi>Blanches</hi> Bay;<note place="margin">

               <p>Now finding our Deckes open, with the long lying vnder the lyne, and on the coast of <hi>Brasill,</hi> the Sunne having beene in our Zenith many times, we calked our ship, within bourd and without, aboue the Decks. And such was the diligence we vsed, that at foure dayes end, we had aboue threescore Pipes of water, and twentie Boats of wood stowed in our Ship: no man was idle, nor otherwise busied but in necessary workes: some in felling and cleaving of wood; some in carrying of water; some in romaging; some in washing, others in baking; one in heating of pitch, another in ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of Mussells; no man was exempted, but knew at evening, wherevnto he was to betake himselfe the morning following.</p>

This we remedied the best wee could, and discovered it long before we came to this place.</p>
               <p>Hereof let others take warning,<note place="margin">Warning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst wormes.</note> in no place to haue Caske on the shore, where it may be avoyded; for it is one of the provisions, which are with greatest care to be preserved in long Voyages, and hardest to be supplyed. These <hi>Arters,</hi> or <hi>Broma,</hi> in all hot Countries enter into the plankes of Shippes, and especially where are Rivers of fresh water; (for the common opinion is, that they are bred in fresh water, and with the current of the Rivers are brought into the Sea) but experience teacheth, that they breed in the great Seas in all hott Clymates, especially neere the Equinoctiall lyne; for lying so long vnder and neere the lyne, and towing a Shalop at our sterne, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to clense her in <hi>Brasil,</hi> we found her all vnder water covered with these wormes, as bigge as the little finger of a man, on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side of the planke, not fully covered, but halfe the thicknes of their bodie, like to a gelly wrought into the planke as with a Gowdge. And naturall reason (in my iudgement) confirmeth this; for crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures bread and nourished in the Sea, comming into fresh water die; as those actually bred in Ponds, or fresh Rivers die presently, if they come into Salt water.</p>
               <p>But some man may say; this fayleth in some Fishes and Beasts.</p>
               <p>Which I must confesse to be true; but these eyther are part ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restryall, and part aquatile, as the Mare-maide, Sea-horse, and other of that kind, or haue their breeding in the fresh, and growth or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall nourishment in the Salt water, as the Salmond, and others of that kinde.</p>
               <p>In little time, if the Shippe be not sheathed,<note place="margin">Sheathing of Shippes.</note> they put all in haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard; for they enter in no bigger then a small Spanish Needle, and by little and little their holes become ordinarily greater then a mans finger. The thicker the planke is, the greater he groweth;
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:20492:43"/>
yea, I haue seene many Shippes so eaten, that the most of their plankes vnder water haue beene like honey combes, and especially those betwixt wind and water. If they had not beene sheathed, it had bin impossible that they could haue swomme. The entring of them is hardly to be discerned, the most of them being small as the head of a Pinne. Which, all such, as purpose long Voyages, are to prevent by sheathing their Shippes.</p>
               <p>And for that I haue seene divers manners of sheathing, for the ignorant I will set them downe which by experience I haue found best.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Spaine,</hi> and <hi>Portingall,</hi>

                  </note> some sheath their Shippes with Lead; which, besides the cost and waight, although they vse the thinnest sheet-lead that I haue seene in any place, yet it is nothing durable, but subiect to many casualties.</p>
               <p>Another manner is vsed with double plankes,<note place="margin">with double plankes.</note> as thicke without as within, after the manner of furring; which is little better then that with Lead; for, besides his waight, it dureth little, because the worme in small time passeth through the one and the other.</p>
               <p>A third manner of sheathing hath beene vsed amongst some with fine Canvas;<note place="margin">With Canvas.</note> which is of small continuance, and so not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded.</p>
               <p>The fourth prevention, which now is most accompted of,<note place="margin">With burnt plankes.</note> is to burne the vtter planke till it come to be in every place like a Cole, and after to pitch it; this is not bad.</p>
               <p>In <hi>China</hi> (as I haue beene enformed) they vse a certaine Betane or Varnish,<note place="margin">In <hi>China</hi> with Varnish.</note> in manner of an artificiall pitch, wherewith they trim the outside of their shippes. It is said to be durable, and of that ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, as neither worme, nor water peirceth it; neither hath the Sunne power against it.</p>
               <p>Some haue devised a certaine Pitch, mingled with Glasse, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ingredients, beaten into powder, with which if the Shippe be pitched, it is said, the worme that toucheth it, dyeth; but I haue not heard, that it hath beene vsefull.</p>
               <p>But the most approved of all is the manner of sheathing vsed now adayes in <hi>England,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In <hi>England</hi>

               <p>The invention of the materialles incorporated betwixt the planke and the sheathing, is that indeed which avayleth; for without it many plankes were not sufficient to hinder the entrance of this worme; this manner is thus:</p>

               <p>Some hold opinion, that the tarre killeth the worme; others, that the worme passing the sheathing, and seeking a way through, the hayre and the tarre so involue him, that he is choked therewith; which me thinkes is most probable; this manner of sheathing was invented by my Father; and experience hath taught it to be the best, and of least cost.</p>

               <p>Within halfe an houre it began to thunder and raine, with so much winde as wee were forced to lye a hull, and so darke, that we saw nothing, but when the lightning came. This being one of the narrowest reache<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In fine, Phoebus with his beautifull face light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned our Hemisphere, and reioyced our hearts (hauing driven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue twenty foure leagues in twelue houres lying a hull: whereby, is to be imagined the force of the winde and current.)</p>
               <p>We set our fore-sayle, and returned to our former harbour; from whence, within three or foure dayes, we set sayle againe with a faire winde, which continued with vs till we came within a league of the mouth of the Straite, here the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In which time, the winde and tide put vs so farr to lee-wards, that we could by no meanes seize it: So we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined

to goe to <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Bay, but before we came at it, the night overtooke vs: and this reach being dangerous and narrow, we durst neither hull, nor trye, or turne to and againe with a short sayle, and therefore bare alongst in the middest of the channell, till we were come into the broad reach, then lay a hull till the morning.</p>
               <p>When we set sayle and ran alongst the coast, seeking with our boate some place to anchor in; some foure leagues to the West-wards of Cape <hi>Froward,</hi> we found a goodly bay; which wee named <hi>English</hi> bay:<note place="margin">English Bay.</note> where anchored, we presently went a shore, and found a goodly River of fresh water, and an old Cannoa broken to peeces, and some two or three of the houses of the <hi>Indians,</hi> with peeces of Seale stinking ripe.

For they retyre themselues in the Winter into the Country, where it is more temperate, and yeeldeth better sustenance: for on the Mayne of the Straits, wee neyther saw beast, nor fowle, Sea fowle excepted, and a kind of Blacke-bird, and two hoggs towards the beginning of the Straites.</p>
               <p>Here our ship being well moored, we began to supply our wood and water, that we had spent.

               <p>So one day, we rowed vp the River, with our boat and light horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, to discover it, and the in-land: where having spent a good part of the day, and finding shold water, and many Trees fallen thwart it, and little fruite of our labour, nor any thing worth the noting, we returned.</p>
               <p>Another day, we trayned our people a-shore, being a goodly sandie Bay: another, we had a hurling of Batchelers against married men; This day we were busied in wrestling, the other in shooting; so we were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver idle, neyther thought we the time long.</p>

               <p>Whereupon, it was condescended, that we should all goe aboard the Shippe, and that the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Baldivia,</hi> had its name of a Spanish Captaine so called, whom af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards the <hi>Indians</hi> tooke Prisoner, and it is said, they required of him the reason why he came to molest them, and to take their Country from them, having no title nor right therevnto; he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, to get Gold; which the barbarous vnderstanding, caused Gold to be molten, and powred downe his throat; saying, Gold was thy desire, glut thee with it.</p>
               <p>It standeth in fortie degrees, hath a pleasant River and naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; for a Ship of good burden may goe as high vp as the Cittie, and is a goodly wood Country.</p>
               <p>Here our Beefe beganne to take end, and was then as good, as the day wee departed from <hi>England</hi>; it was preserved in Pickell, which, though it be more chargeable, yet the profit payeth the charge, in that it is made durable, contrary to the opinion of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which hold it impossible, that Beefe should be kept good pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Equinoctiall lyne. And of our Porke I eate in the house of <hi>Don Beltran de Castro,</hi> in <hi>Lyma,</hi> neere foure yeares old, very good, preserved after the same manner, notwithstanding, it had lost his Pickle long before.</p>
               <p>Some degrees before a man come to <hi>Baldivia</hi> to the South-wards, as <hi>Spaniards</hi> haue told me, lyeth the Iland <hi>Chule,</hi> not easily to be discerned from the mayne; for he that passeth by it, cannot but thinke it to be the mayne.

               <p>The 19. of Aprill, being Easter-euen, we anchored vnder the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>Mocha.</hi> It lyeth in 39. degrees, it may be some foure leagues over, and is a high mountainous hill, but round about the foote thereof, some halfe league from the Sea-shore, it is Champion ground, well inhabited, and manured.</p>
               <p>From the Straites to this Iland, we found, that either the coast is set out more westerly then it is, or that, we had a great current, which put vs to the west-wards; for we had not sight of land in

three dayes after. Our reckoning was to see it, but for that we coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted not the land, I cannot determine, whether it was caused by the current, or lying of the land. But <hi>Spaniards</hi> which haue sayled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longst it, haue told me, that it is a bold and safe coast, and reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble sounding of it.</p>
               <p>In this Iland of <hi>Mocha</hi> we had communication and contratation with the inhabitants, but with great vigilancie and care; for they and all the people of <hi>Chily,</hi> are mortall enemies to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and held vs to be of them; and so esteemed Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> when he was in this Iland, which was the first land also that he touched on this coast. They vsed him with so fine a trechery, that they possessed themselues of all the Oares in his Boate, saving two, and in striving to get them also, they slew, and hurt all his men; himselfe who had fewest wounds, had three, and two of them in the head. Two of his company which lived long after, had, the one seaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene; his name was <hi>Iohn Bruer,</hi> who afterward was Pilot with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Candish</hi>; and the other, aboue twentie, a <hi>Negro</hi>-servant to Sir <hi>Francis Drake.</hi>
               </p>

                  </note> for I suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered none to treate with me, nor with my people with Armes.

The rest of their lading was plankes, Spares, and Tymber, for <hi>Lyma,</hi> and the valleyes, which is a rich trade; for it hath no Tymber, but that which is brought to it from other places. They had also many Packes of <hi>Indian</hi> Mantles, (but of no value vnto vs) with much Tallow, and <hi>Manteca de Puerco,</hi> and aboundance of great new Chests, in which wee had thought to be some great masse of wealth, but opening them, found nothing but Apples therein; all which was good Marchandize in <hi>Lyma,</hi> but to vs of small accompt.

It is a good Harbour for all windes, that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take not of the North; for it runneth vp South and by West, and South South-west, but it hath much fowle ground.</p>
               <p>In one of these Shippes wee found a new devise for the stopping of a sodaine Leake in a Shippe vnder water, without board,<note place="margin">A new devise for stopping a Leake with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out board.</note> when a man cannot come to it within board; which eased vs of one, that we had from the day we departed from <hi>Detford,</hi> caused by the touching a-ground of our Shippe at low water, being loaden, and in the neape streames, comming a-ground in the sterne, the force of the tyde caused to cast thwart, wrested her slegg, and that in such sort, as it made a continuall Leake, though not much.

Thus incouraged he them to fight for their liues, limbes, and libertie, choosing rather to die an honourable death fighting, then to liue in servitude, as fruitlesse members in
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:20492:58"/>
their Common-wealth. Thus, vsing the office of a Sergeant Maior, and having loaden his two stumpes with bundles of Arrowes, suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coured those, who in the succeeding battaile had their store wasted, and changing himselfe from place to place, animated and encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his Countri-men, with such comfortable perswasions, as it is reported, and credibly beleeved, that he did much more good with his words, and presence, without striking a stroake, then a great part of the Armie did with fighting to the vtmost.</p>
               <p>The other proofe is, that such of them as fight on horsebacke, are but slightly armed, for that their armour is a Beasts hide, fitted to their bodie, greene, and after worne till it be dry and hard.

The shamefull fruites whereof (found by experience of many yeares, wherein I haue wandred the world) I leaue to touch in particular; because I will not diminish the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of any. But this let me manifest, that there haue bin and are certaine persons, who, before they goe to Sea, either robbe part of the provisions,<note place="margin">The mischiefs of corrupt, or scant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This mischiefe is most ordinary in great actions.</p>
               <p>Lastly, some are so cunning, that they not onely make their voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age by robbing before they goe to Sea, but o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And the principall cause which I can finde for it, is that our Country imployeth her Nobles, of men of credite in all actions of moment, who rather chuse to spend wealth, and gaine honor, then to gaine riches without reputation; whereas in <hi>Spaine,</hi> and other partes, the advancement of poore men and meane persons by favour and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest

A poynt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving consideration and reformation, and which with great faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie may be remedied, if vpright justice would put it selfe as stickler betwixt the owners and Company.</p>
               <p>No lesse worthie of reformation are the generall abuses of Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and Souldiers, who robbe all they can, vnder the colour of Pillage,<note place="margin">Of marriners by challenge of Pillage.</note> and after make Ordinance, Cables, Sayles, Anchors, and all aboue Deckes, to belong vnto them of right, whether they goe by thirdes or wages; this proceedeth from those pilfering warres, wherein every Gallant that can arme out a Shippe, taketh vpon him the name and office of a Captaine, not knowing what to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, nor what to execute. Such Commanders for the most part consort and ioyne vnto themselues disorderly persons, Pyrates, and Ruffians, vnder the title of men of valour and experience: they meeting with any Prise, make all vpon the Deckes theirs of dutie; <hi>viz.</hi> the best peece of Ordinance for the Captaine; the second, for the Gunner; the third, for his Mate; the best Cable and Anchor for the Master; the Maine topsayle, for the Botesman, the bonnetts, for the quarter Masters; and the rest of the Sayles for the company: The Cardes and Instruments of the Master, for the Master; the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geans Instruments and Chest, for the Surgean; the Carpenters Tooles and Chest for the Carpenter; and so consequently of each officer, that answereth the other in the two Shippes.</p>
               <p>If one happen vpon a bag of Gold, Silver, Pearle, or precious Stones, it is held well gotten; provided it be cleanly stolne, though the Shippe, and all her loading besides be not worth so much, lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle considering the common iniury, in defrauding the owners, victuallers, and whole Companie: and forgetting, that if himselfe were a jury-man vpon another in like case, he would adiudge him

Besides, it is grounded on Gods law (from whence all Lawes should be derived) and true justice, which distributeth to every one that which to him belongeth of right, and that in due season.</p>

               <p>My opinion is, that such Malaperts, deserue most iustly to haue their spoyle taken from them, or some worse consideration, and afterwards to be severely punished, in prevention of greater pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudices, then can by paper be well declared.</p>
               <p>But I must tell you withall (such hath beene the partiallitie of some Commissioners in former times) that vpon information, in lieu of punishment, Opinion hath held them for tall fellowes, when, in truth, they never proue the best men in difficult occasions. For their mindes are all set on spoyle, and can bee well contented to suffer their associates to beare the brunt, whillest they are prol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling after pillage, the better to gaine and mainetaine the aforesayd attributes, in Tavernes, and disorderly places.</p>
               <p>For the orderly and quiet men, I haue ever found in all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions to bee of best vse, most valiant, and of greatest sufficiency. Yet I condemne none: but those who will bee reputed valiant, and are not, examine the accusation.</p>

               <p>But as I haue sayd of the consort, so can I not but complaine of many Captaines and Governours,<note place="margin">Against the disloyalties of Captaines.</note> who overcome with like gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die desire of gaine, condiscend to the smoothering and suppressing of this auncient discipline, the cle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Some of these cause the bils of lading to bee cast into the Sea, or so to bee hidden, that they never appeare.

               <p>To this Bay, assoone as our people in the Pynnas saw their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, they brought their tackes abourd, and turned and tyded it vp, as they could.

And being the Armado (as it was) we gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned time to fit our selues, the better to fight. And truly (as before, to a stiffe-necked horse,) so now againe, I cannot but resemble the condition of the Marriner to any thing better, then to the current of a furious Riuer, repressed by force or art, which neuerthelesse ceaseth not to seeke a way to ouerthrow both fence and banke: Euen so the common sort of Sea-men, apprehending a conceite in their imaginations, neither experiment, knowledge, examples, reasons nor authority can alter or remoove them from their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited opinions. In this extremitie, with reason I laboured to conuince them, and to contradict their pretences; But they alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether without reason, or against reason, breake out, some into vaunting and bragging, some into reproaches of want of courage, others into wishings, that they had neuer come out of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:20492:67"/>
if we should refuse to fight with two shippes whatsoeuer. And to mend the matter, the Gunner (for his part) assured me that with the first tire of shott:<note place="margin">The vnadvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed courage of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> he would lay the one of them in the sods: And our Pynace, that she would take the other to taske. One pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, that he would cut downe the mayne yard, another that he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ould take their flagge; And all in generall shewed a great desire to come to tryall with the enemy. To some I turned the deafe eare, with others I dissembled, and armed my selfe with patience (hauing no other defence nor remedie for that occasion) soothing and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating them to the execution of what they promised, and perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them to haue a little sufferance, seeing they gained time, and aduantage by it.</p>
               <p>And to giue them better satisfaction I condiscended, that our Captaine with a competent number of men, should with our Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace goe to discouer them; with order, that they should not engage themselues in that manner, as they might not be able to come vnto vs, or we to succour them. In all these divisions and opinions, our Master <hi>Hugh Dormish</hi> (who was a most sufficient man for gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and valour, and well saw the errors of the multitude) vsed his office, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> became him; and so did all those of best vnderstanding.</p>
               <p>In short space, our Pinnace discouered what they were, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting about to returne vnto vs, the Vice-admirall (being next her) began with her chace to salute her with three or foure peeces of Artilery, and so continued chasing her, and gunning at her. My company seeing this, now began to change humour; And <hi>I,</hi> then, to encourage, and perswade them to performe the execution of their promises and vaunts of valour, which they had but euen now protested, and giuen assurance of, by their proferres and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnesse.</p>
               <p>And that we might haue Sea-roome to fight, we presently weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Anchor, and stood off to Sea with all our sayles, in hope to get the weather gage of our contraries. But the winde scanting with vs, and larging with them, we were forced to leeward.

bourding: But contrary to all expectation, our stearne peeces were vnprimed, and so were all those,<note place="margin">And careles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the English.</note> which we had to leward (saue halfe one in the quarter) which discharged wrought that effect in our contraries as that they had fiue or sixe foot water in hold, before they suspected it.</p>
               <p>Hereby all men are to take warning by me, not to trust any man in such extremities, when he himselfe may see it done:<note place="margin">How farre a Commander is to trust his officers.</note> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to fight, let the Chiefetaine himselfe be sure to haue all his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilery in a readinesse, vpon all occasions. This was my ouersight, this my ouerthrow. For I, and all my company, had that satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the sufficiencie, and care of our Gunner, as not any one of vs euer imagined there would be any defect found in him. For my part, I, with the rest of our Officers, occupied our selues in clee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring our deckes, laceing our nettings, making of Bulwarkes, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming our toppes, fitting our wast-cloathes, tallowing our pikes, slinging our yards, doubling our sheetes, and tackes, placing and ordering our people, and procuring that they should be well fitted and prouided of all things; leauing the Artilery, and other instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of fire, to the Gunners dispose and order, with the rest of his Mates and adherents: which (as I said) was part of our perdition. For bearing me euer in hand, that he had fiue hundred Cartreges in a readinesse, within one houres fight, we were forced to occupie three persons, only in making and filling Cartreges, and of five hundreth Elles of Canvas and other Cloth giuen him for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, at sundry times, not one yard was to be found. For this we have no excuse, and therefore could not avoyde the danger, to charge and discharge with the ladell, especially in so hotte a fight. And comming now to put in execution the sinking of the shippe, as he promised, he seemed a man without life or soule. So the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall comming close vnto vs, I my selfe, and the Master of our Shippe, were forced to play the Gunners.</p>
               <p>Those instruments of fire, wherein he made me to spend exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siuely (before our going to Sea) now appeared not;<note place="margin">Deceit of the Gann<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Some of our Company had him in suspition, to be more friend to the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, then to vs; for that he had served some yeares in the <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cera,</hi> as Gunner, and that he did all this of purpose. Few of our peeces were cleere, when we came to vse them, and some had the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:20492:68"/>
shott first put in, and after the powder. Besides, after our surrendry; it was laid to his charge, that he should say; he had a brother that served the King in the <hi>Peru,</hi> and that he thought he was in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mado; and how he would not for all the world, he should be slaine. Whether this were true or no, I know not, but I am sure all in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall gave him an ill report, and that he, in whose hands the chiefe execution of the whole fight consisted, executed nothing as was promised and expected.</p>
               <p>The griefe and remembrance of which oversights once againe inforceth me to admonish all Captaines and Commanders hereby to take aduice,<note place="margin">Admonitions, for Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</note> now and then to survey their officers and store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roomes; the oftener, the better; that so their defects and wants may be supplied in time; Neuer relying too much vpon the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar report, nor giuing too much credite to smooth tongues and boasting Companions. But to performe this taske, it is requisite that all Captaines, and Commanders were such, and so experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented in all offices, that they might be able as well to controule as to examine all manner of errors in officers. For the government at Sea hardly suffereth a head without exquisite experience. The deficiency whereof hath occasioned some ancient Sea-men, to straighten the attribute of <hi>Marriner</hi> in such sort,<note place="margin">Who to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a true <hi>Marriner.</hi>
                  </note> as that it ought not to be giuen, but to the man, who is able to build his shippe, to fit and prouide her of all things necessary, and after to carry her about the world: the residue, to be but saylers. Hereby giuing vs to vnderstand, that though it is not expedient, that he should be an Axe-Carpenter, to hewe, cut, frame, and mould each timber piece, yet that he should know the parts and peeces of the shippe, the value of the timber,<note place="margin">His know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge for Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terialls.</note> planke and yron-worke, so to be able as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well to build in proportion, as to procure all materials at a iust price. And againe though it be not expected, that he should <hi>sowe</hi> the sayles, arme the shrowds, and put the tackling over head, yet is it requisite that should know how to cut his sayles, what length is Competent to every Roape, and to be of sufficiency to reprehend and reforme those who erre,<note place="margin">For provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> and doe amisse. In providing his shippe with victualls, munition and necessaries, of force it must be expected: that he be able to make his estimate, and (that once pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, and perfected) in season, and with expedition to see it loden and stowed commodiously, with care and proportion. After that, He is to order the spending thereof, that in nothing he be defrau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at home, and at Sea, euer to know, how much is spent, and what remaineth vnspent.</p>
               <p>In the Art of Nauigation,<note place="margin">For Navigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> he is bound also to know, so much, as

               <p>The Captaine of the Viceadmirall, being more hardy then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderate, and presuming with his shippe and company to get the price, and chiefe honour; wayted not the time to put in execution the direction giuen,<note place="margin">The Spaniards pay deerely for their rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note> but presently came abourd to wind wards vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon our broad side.

and animating of vs. For although shee was as long, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther longer then our shippe, being rarely built, and vtterly without fights or defence; what with our Muskets, and what with our fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works we cleered her deckes in a moment; so that scarce any person appeared. And doubtlesse if we had entred but a dozen men, we might haue enforced them to haue rendred vnto vs, or taken her, but our company being few, and the principall of them slaine, or hurt, we durst not, neither was it wisedome, to aduenture the separation of those, which remained: and so held that for the best and soundest resolution, to keepe our forces together in defence of our owne.</p>
               <p>The Viceadmirall seeing himselfe in great distresse, called to his Admirall for succour: who presently laid him abourd, and entred a hundreth of his men, and so cleered themselues of vs.</p>
               <p>In this bourding the Viceadmirall had at the least thirtie and sixe men hurt, and slaine; and amongst them his Pilote shot through the body, so as he dyed presently. And the Admirall also receiued some losse; which wrought in them a new resolution;<note place="margin">And take a new resolution</note> only with their Artillery to batter vs; and so with time to force vs to surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or to sinke vs; which they put in execution; and placing themselues within a Musket shott of our weather quarter, and sometimes on our broad side, lay continually beating vpon vs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out intermission; which was doubtlesse the best and securest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination they could take, for they being rare shippes, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any manner of close fights, in bourding with vs, their men were all open vnto vs, and we vnder couert and shelter. For on all parts our shippe was Musket free, and the great Artillery of force must cease on either side (the shippes bei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>g once grapled together) except we resolued to sacrifice our selues together in fire. For it is impossible, if the great Ordinance play (the shippes being bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) but that they must set fire on the shippe they shoote at; and then no surety can be had to free himselfe, as experience daily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth. For a peece of Artillery most properly resembleth a thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derclap, which breaking vpwards, or on the side, hurteth not; for that the fire hath scope to dispence it selfe without finding resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, till the violence which forceth it taketh end, and so it mounts to its center: but breaking downe right or stooping down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and finding resistance or impediment (before the violence that forceth it take end, being so subtill and penetrable a substance) passeth and pierceth so wonderfully, as it leaueth the effect of his execution in all points answerable to his leuell and nighnesse. For if the clouds be nigh the earth (as some are higher, some lower) and
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:20492:72"/>
breake down-wards, the violence wherewith the fire breaketh out is such, and of so strange an execution, that men haue beene found dead, without any outward signe in their flesh, and yet all their bones burnt to dust. So the blade of the sword hath beene found broken all to peeces in the scabard, and the scabard whole with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blemish: And a cristall glasse all shiuered in peeces, his couer and case remaining sound, which commeth to passe, for that in the flesh, in the scabard, and in the case, the fire being so subtile of nature, findeth easie passage without resistance, but the bones, the blade, the Cristall, being of substance more solide, maketh greater resistance, and so the fire with the more fury worketh the more his execution in its obiects. As was seene in the Spanish Admirall (or Captaine) after my imprisonment, crossing from <hi>Panama</hi> to Cape <hi>San Francisco,</hi> a Rayo (for so the Spaniards call a thund<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The fire out of a cloude worketh like effect only, where it leveleth directly, as experience daily teacheth; killing those who are opposite, hurting those who are neere, And only terrifying those who are further di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant.</p>
               <p>In like manner the peece of Ordinance hurteth not those which stand aside, nor those which stand a slope from his mouth, but those alone which stand directly against the true point of his levell: though sometimes the winde of the shott ouerthroweth one, and the splin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ers (being accidents) mayne and hurt others. But prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally where the peece doth resemble the thunderclappe, as when the shippes are bourded. For then, although the Artillery be discharged without shott, the fury of the fire, and his piercing nature is such, as it entreth by the seames, and all parts of the ships sides, and meeting with so fit matter as Pitch, Tarre, Ocombe, and sometimes with powder, presently conuerteth all into flames.</p>
               <p>For auoyding whereof, as also the danger and damage which
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:20492:73"/>

               <p>Some haue thought it a good pollicy to launce out some ends of Mastes or yards by the ports or other parts:<note place="margin">Pollicies to a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>voyde bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.</note> but this is to be v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the greater shippes, for in the lesser, though they be neuer so strong, the waight of the bigger will beate out the opposite sides, and doe hurt, and make great spoyle in the lesser. And in bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, ordinarily the lesser shippe hath all the harme, which the one shippe can doe vnto the other.</p>
               <p>Here is offered to speake of a point much canvassed amongst Carpenters, and Sea Captaines, diversly maintained, but yet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determined: that is, whether the race or loftie built shippe, bee best for the Merchant, and those which imploy themselues in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding:<note place="margin">Dispute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ships of Trade.</note> I am of opinion, that the race shippe is most conuenient; yet so, as that every perfect shippe ought to haue two deckes, for the better strengthening of her; the better succouring of her peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; the better preseruing of her Merchandize and victuall, and for her greater safetie from sea and stormes.</p>
               <p>But for the Princes shippes,<note place="margin">Concerning the Prince his shippes.</note> and such as are imployed continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the warres, to be built loftie I hold very necessary for many reasons. First for Maiestie and terrour of the enemy; secondly, for harbouring of many men; thirdly for accommodating more men to fight; fourthly, for placing and vsing more Artillery; fift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for better strengthening and securing of the shippe, sixtly for ouertopping and subiecting the enemy; seuenthly, for greater safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard and defence of the ship and company. For it is plaine, that the ship with three deckes, or with two and a halfe, shewes more pomp then another of her burthen with a decke and halfe, or two deckes, and breedeth greater terror to the enemy, discouering her selfe to be a more powerfull ship as she is, then the other; which being indeed a ship of force, seemeth to be but a Barke, and with her low building hideth her burthen. And who doubteth, that a decke and a halfe cannot harbour that proportion of men, that two deckes, and two deckes and a halfe can accommodate to fight; Nor carry the Artillery so plentifully, nor so commodiously. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can the ship be so strong with a decke and a halfe, as with two deckes, nor with two, as with three; nor carry her Mastes so taunt; nor spread so great a clue; nor contriue so many fightes, to answer

And if they had come to boord with the Spanish high-charged ships, it is not to be doubted but they would haue mustred themselues better, then those which could not with their prowesse nor props, haue reached to their wastes. The strength of the one cannot be compared with the strength of the other: but in bourding, it goeth not so much in the strength, as in weight and greatnesse. For the greater ship that bourdeth with the lesser; with her Mastes, her Yards, her Tacklings, her Anchors, her Ordinance, and with her sides bruseth and beateth the lesser to peeces, although the lesser be farre stronger according to propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

               <p>Whereunto he made answere; my good Generall, I hope you haue made experience of my resolution, which shall be euer to put in execution, what you shall be pleased to command me; and my actions shall giue testimonie of the obligation wherein I stand bound vnto you. What I haue done, hath not proceeded from faintnesse of heart, nor from a will to see imaginations put in execution (for besides the losse of our reputation, liberty, and what good else we can hope for.) I know the Spaniard too too well, and the manner of his proceedings, in discharge of promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, but only to giue satisfaction to the rest of the Company, which importuned me to mooue this point. I condiscended to that, which now I am ashamed of, and grieue at, because I see it disli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to you. And here I vowe to fight it out, till life or lymmes fayle me. Bee you pleased to recommend vs to Almightie God, and to take comfort in him, whom I hope will giue vs victory, and restore you to health and strength, for all our comforts, and the happy accomplishing and finishing of our voyage, to his glory.</p>
               <p>I replyed: this is that which beseemeth you; this sorteth to the opinion I euer held of you; and this will gaine you (with God and man) a iust reward. And you the rest (my deere companions and friends) who euer haue made a demonstration of desire to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish your duties, remember, that when we first discryed our enemy, you shewed to haue a longing to prooue your valours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him: Now that the occasion is offered, lay hold of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locke. For if once shee turne her backe, make sure accompt neuer after to see her face againe; and as true English men, and followers
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:20492:77"/>
of the steppes of our forefathers, in vertue and valour, sell your bloods and liues deerely, that Spaine may euer record it with sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and griefe. And those which surviue, reioyce in the purchase of so noble a victory with so small meanes against so powerfull an enemy.</p>
               <p>Hereunto they made answer; that as hitherto they had beene conformable to all the vndertakings, which I had commanded or counselled, so they would continue in the selfe same dutie and obedience to the last breath: vowing either to remaine Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and Free-men, or else to sell their liues at that price, which their enemies should not willingly consent to buy them at. And with this resolution, both Captaine and company tooke their leaue of me, euery one particularly, and the greater part with teares, and and imbracings, though we were forthwith to depart the world, and neuer see one the other againe, but in heauen; promising to cast all forepassed imaginations into oblivion, and never more to speake of surrendry.</p>
               <p>In accomplishment of this promise and determination,<note place="margin">They resolue to fight it out.</note> they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severed in sustaining the fight, all this night, with the day and night following, and the third day after. In which time the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie never left vs, day nor night, beating continually vpon vs, with his great and small shott. Saving that every morning an how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er before breake of day, hee edged a little from vs, to breath,<note place="margin">The Enemie breatheth,</note> and to remedie such defects as were amisse; as also to consult, what they should doe the day and night following.</p>
               <p>This time of interdiction, we imployed, in repayring our sayles, and tacklings, in stopping our leakes,<note place="margin">The English repaire their defects.</note> in fishing and wolling our mastes and yards, in mending our pumpes, and in fitting and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding our selues for the day to come: though this was but little space for so many workes, yet gaue it great reliefe and comfort vnto vs, and made vs better able to endure the defence: for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, our shippe must of force haue suncke before our surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry, having many shot vnder water, and our pumpes shot to pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces every day: In all this space, not any man of either part tooke rest or sleepe, and little sustenance; besides bread and wine.</p>
               <p>In the second dayes fight, the Vice-admirall comming vpon our quarter, <hi>William Blanch,</hi> one of our Masters mates, with a luckie hand, made a shot vnto her, with one of our sterne peeces; it cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away his maine Mast close by the decke: wherewith the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall beare vp to her, to see what harme shee had received, and to giue her such succour, as shee was able to spare: which we seeing, were in good hope, that they would haue now left to molest vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:20492:78"/>
longer, having wherewithall to entertaine themselues in redres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing their owne harmes. And so we stood away from them, close by as we could:<note place="margin">Advant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At the least, it would haue declared to our enemies, that wee had them in little estimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when able to goe from them, we would not: and perhaps bin a cause to haue made them to leaue vs.</p>
               <p>But this occasion was let slip, as also, that other to fight with them, sayling quarter winds, or before the winde: for having stood off to Sea, a day and a night, we had scope to fight at our pleasure, and no man having sea roome, is bound to fight as his enemie will, with disadvantage, being able otherwise to deale with equalitie: contrariwise, every man ought to seeke the meanes hee can, for his defence, and greatest advantage, to the annoyance of his contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</p>
               <p>Now wee might with our fore-saile, low set, haue borne vpp be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the winde, and the enemie of force must haue done the like<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if hee would fight with vs, or keepe vs company: and then should wee haue had the advantage of them. For although their Artillery were longer, waightier, and many more then ours, and in truth did pierce with greater violence;<note place="margin">The difference of shot.</note> yet ours being of greater bore, and carrying a waightier and greater shot, was of more importance and of better effect for sinking and spoyling: For the smaller shot passeth through, and maketh but his whole, and harmeth that which lyeth in his way; but the greater shaketh and shivereth all it meeteth, and with the splinters, or that which it encountreth, many times doth more hurt, then with his proper circumference: as is plainely seene in the battery by land, when the Saker, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my-Colverin,<note place="margin">Their effects.</note> the Colverin, and demi-Canon, (being peeces that reach much further point blanke then the Cannon) are nothing of like importance for making the breach, as is the Cannon; for that this shot being ponderous pierceth with difficultie, yea wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth better effects, tormenting, shaking and overthrowing all; whereas the others, with their violence, pierce better, and make onely their hole, and so hide themselues in the Wooll or Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</p>
               <p>Besides (our Ship being yare and good of fleeridge) no doubt but we should haue played better with our Ordinance, and with
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:20492:78"/>
more effect, then did our enemies; which was a great errour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to fight with lesse disadvantage,<note place="margin">Errors in Fight,</note> and yet to fight with the most that could be imagined, which I knew not off, neither was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to direct, though I had knowne it; being in a manner senselesse, what with my woonds, and what with the agony of the surrendry propounded, for that I had seldome knowne it spoken of, but that it came afterwards to be put in execution.</p>
               <p>The Generall not being able to succour his Vice-admirall, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he should vtterly leaue vs, gaue them order, to shift as well as they could <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Himselfe presently followed the Chase, and in short space fetched vs vp, and beganne a fresh to bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vs with his great and small shott. The Vice-admirall (hauing saued what they could) cutt the rest by the bourd, and with Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayle and My son came after vs also, and before the setting of the Sunne, were come vpon our broad side, wee bearing all our Sayles, and after kept vs company, lying vpon our weather quarter, and annoying vs what shee could.</p>
               <p>Here I hold it necessary, to make mention of two things, which were most preiudiciall vnto vs, and the principall causes of our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, the errours and faults of late dayes, crept in amongst those who follow the Sea, and learned from the <hi>Flemings</hi> and <hi>Easterlings.</hi>

                  </note> I wish that by our misfortunes others would take warning, and procure to redresse them, as occasions shall be offered.</p>
               <p>The one, is to fight vnarmed, where they may fight armed.<note place="margin">

                  </note> The other, is in comming to fight, to drinke themselues drunke. Yea, some are so madd, that they mingle Powder with Wine, to giue it the greater force, imagining that it giueth spirit, strength, and courage, and taketh away all feare and doubt. The latter is for the most part true, but the former is false and beastly, and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether against reason. For though the nature of Wine, with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, is to comfort and reviue the heart, and to fortifie and strengthen the spirit; yet the immoderate vse thereof worketh quite contrary effects.</p>
               <p>In fights, all receipts which adde courage and spirit, are of great regard, to be allowed, and vsed; and so is a draught of Wine, to be giuen to euery man before he come to action, but more then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough is pernicious; for, exceeding the meane, it offendeth, and infeebleth the sences, converting the strength (which should resist the force of the enemy) into weakenesse: it dulleth and blindeth the vnderstanding, and consequently depraueth any man of true valour. For that he is disenabled to iudge and apprehend the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,

which may be offered, to assault, and retyre in time conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient; the raynes of reason being put into the hands of passion and disorder. For after I was wounded, this <hi>nimium</hi> bred great disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and inconvenience in our Shippe; the pott continually wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, infused desperate and foolish hardinesse in many, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Which truely was great mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and a lamentable fault, worthy to be banished from amongst all reasonable people, and well to be weighed by all Commanders. For if the <hi>Spaniard</hi> surpasseth vs in any thing, it is in his tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,<note place="margin">The <hi>Spaniard</hi> surpasseth vs onely in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance.</note> and suffering: and, where he hath had the better hand of vs, it hath beene (for the most part) through our owne folly, for that we will fight vnarmed with him being armed. And although I haue heard many men maintaine, that in Shipping, Armour is of little profit; All men of good vnderstanding, will condemne such desperate ignorance. For besides, that the sleightest Armour secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the parts of a mans body (which it covereth) from Pike, Sword, and all hand weapons: it likewise giueth boldnesse and courage; a man Armed, giueth a greater and a waightier blow, then a man vnarmed; he standeth faster, and with greater difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is to be overthrowne.</p>

               <p>Whereas I haue knowne many bred in cold Countries, in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment complaine of the waight of their Armes, that they smoother them, and then cast them off, chusing rather to be shott through with a Bullet, or lanched through with a Pike, or thrust through with a Sword, then to endure a little travaile and suffering. But let me giue these lazie ones this lesson, that he that will goe a warre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, must resolue himselfe to fight; and he that putteth on this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, must be contented to endure both heate and waight, first, for the safegard of his life, and next for subduing of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie; both which are hazarded, and put into great danger, if he fight vnarmed with an enemy armed.</p>
               <p>Now for mine owne opinion, I am resolved that Armour is more necessary by Sea, then by Land,<note place="margin">Armes more necessary by Sea, then at Land.</note> yea, rather to be excused on the shore, then in the Shippe. My reason is, for that on the shore the Bullet onely hurteth, but in the Shippe, I haue seene the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> to haue passed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out touching any person. As in the <hi>Galeon,</hi> in which I came out of the <hi>Indies,</hi> in Anno 1597. in the rode of <hi>Tercera,</hi> when the Queenes Maiesties Shippes, vnder the charge of the Earle of <hi>Essex</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> chased vs into the rode, with the splinters of one shott, were slaine, maymed, and sore hurt, at the least a dozen persons, the most part whereof had beene excused, if they had beene Armed.</p>
               <p>And doubtlesse, if these errours had beene foreseene, and reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died by vs, many of those who were slaine and hurt, had beene on foote, and we inabled to haue sustained and maintained the fight much better and longer; and perhaps at last had freed our selues. For if our enemy had come to bourd with vs, our close fights were such, as we were secure, and they open vnto vs. And what with our Cubridge heads, one answering the other, our hatches vpon bolts, our brackes in our Deckes, and Gunner roome, it was impossible to take vs as long as any competent number of men had remained, twentie persons would haue sufficed for defence; and for this, such Shippes are called <hi>Impregnable,</hi> and are not to be taken, but by sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render, not to be overcome, but with bourding or sinking, as in vs by experience was verified: and not in vs alone, but in the <hi>Revenge</hi> of the Queenes Maiestie, which being compassed round about with all the <hi>Armado</hi> of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and bourded sundry times by many at once, is said, to haue sunke three of the <hi>Armado</hi> by her side.</p>

                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:20492:80"/>And in this conflict, having lost all her Mastes, and being no other then a logge in the Sea, could not bee taken with all their force and pollicie, till shee surrendred her selfe by an honourable composition.</p>
               <p>By these presidents, let Governours by Sea take speciall care aboue all, to preserue their people, in imitation of the French; who carrie many Souldiers in their shippes of Warre, and secure them in their holdes, till they come to entring, and to proue their forces by the dint of Sword.</p>

And so no greater errour can bee committed, then to commend such charges to men vnexperimented in this profession.</p>
               <p>A third and last cause, of the losse of sundry of our men, most worthy of note for all Captaines, owners, and Carpenters: was the race building of our shippe;<note place="margin">Race-ships of Warre disliked</note> the onely fault shee had; and now a dayes, held for a principall grace in any shippe: but by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience which I haue had, it seemeth for sundry reasons verie preiudiciall for shippes of Warre, For in such, those which tackle the sayles, of force must bee vpon the deckes, and are open with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out shelter, or any defence: yet here it will be obiected; That for this inconvenience, wast clothes are provided,<note place="margin">Wast-clothes not so vsefull,</note> and for want of them, it is vsuall to lace a bonnet, or some such shadow for the men; worthily may it bee called a shadow, and one of the most pernitious customes, that can be vsed, for this shadow, or defence, being but of linnen or wollen cloth, emboldeneth many; who without it would retire to better securitie, whereas now thinking themselues vnseene, they become more bould, then otherwise they would, and thereby shot through, when they least thinke of it; Some Captaines observing this errour, haue sought to reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die it, in some of his Maiesties shippes: not by altering the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,<note place="margin">as other devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</note> but by devising a certaine defence, made of foure or fiue inch planckes of fiue foote high, and sixe foote broad, running vpon wheeles, and placed in such partes of the shippe, as are most open. These they name blenders, and made of Elme for the most part; for that it shivers not with a shot, as Oake and other Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber will doe, which are now in vse and service, but best it is, when the whole side hath one blender, and one armour of proofe, for defence of those, which of force must labour, and be a lost.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:20492:80"/>This race building, first came in, by overmuch homing in of our shippes; and received for good, vnder colour of making our ships thereby the better sea-shippes, and of better advantage to hull and trye: but in my iudgement, it breedeth many inconveniences, and is farre from working the effect they pretend, by disinabling them for bearing their cage worke correspondent, to the proportion and mould of the shippe, making them tender sided, and vnable to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sayle in any fresh gaile of winde, and diminishing the play of their Artillery, and the place for accommodating their people to fight, labor, or rest.</p>
               <p>And I am none of those, who hold opinion, that the over-much homing in, the more the better, is commodious and easier for the shippe; and this out of the experience, that I haue learned; which with forcible reasons, I could proue to be much rather discomodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and worthy to be reformed.

Whereunto hee made answere, that hee had manifested
