            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CASE OF THE ALLEGIANCE DUE TO Soveraign Powers, DEFENDED, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THere is nothing more evident, than that GOD set up a <hi>Supreme</hi> and Soveraign Power in the Jewish Nation, as could not, and ought not to be resisted by the Fundamental Laws of their Government; not that the Supreme and Soveraign Power is alwaies to be in a single Person, but that where-ever it is, it is irresistible; and that whenever this Supreme Power by the Laws of the Nation is invested in a single person, such a Prince must not, upon any Pretence whatsoever, be resisted.</p>
            <p>To prove this, I shall begin with Examples out of the Old Testament.</p>
            <p>The first Governour God set over the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> when he brought them out of the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> was <hi>Moses</hi>; and I think I need not prove how sacred and irresistible his
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60955:5"/>
Authority was. This is sufficiently evident in the Rebellion of <hi>Korah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> against <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> when God caused the Earth to open her Mouth and swallow them up, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. And least this should be thought an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary cafe, <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>xtraordinary persons, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately appointed by God, and governed by his imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Direction, the Apostle St. <hi>Jude</hi> alledges this Example against those in his daies, who were turbulent and factious, who despised Dominions, and spake evil of Dignities, <hi>Jud.</hi> v. 11. which he could not have done, had not this Example extended to all ordinary as well as extraordinary Cases; had it not been a lasting Testimony of God's Displeasure against all those who oppose themselves against the Soveraign Powers. But <hi>Moses</hi> was not alwaies to rule over them, and therefore God expresly provides for a Succ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ssion of Soveraign Powers, to which they must all submit. The ordinary Soveraign Power of the Jewish Nation aft<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r <hi>Moses</hi>'s death, was devolved either on the High Priest, or those extraordinary persons, whom God was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to raise up, such as <hi>Joshua,</hi> and the several Judges, till in <hi>Samuel</hi>'s days it settled in their Kings. For, as for the Jewish <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> whose Power is so much extolled by the Jewish Writers, who are all of a late date, many years since the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and therefore no competent Witnesses of what was done so many Ages before; it does not appear from any Testimony of Scripture, that there was any such Court of Judicature, till after their return from the Babylonish Captivity.</p>
            <p>But yet God took care to secure the Peace and good Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Nation, by appointing such a Power as should receive the last Appeals, and whose Sentence in all Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies should be final and uncontroulable; as you may see in the 17th. of <hi>Deut</hi> 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. <hi>ver.</hi> There were inferiour Magistrates and Judges appointed in their several Tribes and Cities, which <hi>Moses</hi> did by the advice of <hi>Jeth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o</hi> his Father-in-law, and by the approbation of God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 18. But as the Supreme Power was still reserved in the hands of <hi>Moses,</hi> while he lived, so it is here secured to the High Priest or Judges after his death; for, it is expresly appointed, That if those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Judges could not determine the Controversie, they should come unto the Priests and Levites; that is, the Priests of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60955:5"/>
the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> (who by the 12. <hi>ver.</hi> appears only to be the <hi>High Priests) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd to the Judge that shall be in those days</hi>; that is, if it shall be at such a time, when there is an extraordinary Judge raised by God (for there were not alwaies such Judges in <hi>Israel</hi>; as is evide<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

            </p>
            <p>Where the Place which God shall chuse, signifies the Place which he should appoint for the <hi>Ark</hi> of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and for the <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>l Worship</hi>; which was the place where the High Priest, and the <hi>chief Judge</hi> or <hi>Ruler</hi> of <hi>Israel,</hi> when there was any such person, had their ordinary residence; which was first at <hi>Shilo,</hi> and afterwards at <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Authority of the chief Priests, or of the Judge, when there was one, in those days, was as absolute Authority as the most absolute Monarch in the World can challenge, <hi>v.</hi> 12. That Disobedience to their last &amp; final Determination, whatever the cause be, shall be punisht with Death: And what place can there be for <hi>Resistance</hi> in such a Constitution of Government as this? It is said indeed, in <hi>v.</hi> 11. <hi>according to the sentence of the Law, which they shall teach thee, and according to the judgment that they shall tell thee, thou shalt do.</hi> And hence some conclude, that they were not bound to abide by their Sentence, nor were pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishable if they did not, but only in such cases, when they gave Sentence according to the Law of God. But these Men do not consider, that the matter in controversie is supposed to be doubtful, and such as could not be determined by the <hi>inferiour Courts,</hi> and therefore is submitted to the decision of the <hi>Supreme Judge,</hi> and as he determined, so they must do, and no man, under the penalty of Death, must presume to do otherwise: Which takes away all liberty of judging from private persons, though this <hi>Supreme Judge</hi> might possibly mistake in his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as all <hi>human Judicatures</hi> are liable to mistakes; but it seems God Almighty thought it necessary, that there should be some final Judgment, from whence there should be no Appeal, notwithstanding the possibility of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>istake in it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:60955:6"/>So that there was a <hi>Supreme</hi> and <hi>Soveraign,</hi> that is, unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and irresistable Power in the Jewish Nation appointed by God himself; for indeed it is not possible that the publick Peace and Security of any Nation should be preserved without it. And I think it is as plain, That when the Jews would have a King, their Kings were invested with this <hi>supreme</hi> and <hi>irresistible Power</hi>; for when they desired a King, they did not desire a meer <hi>nominal</hi> and <hi>titular King,</hi> but <hi>a King to judge them,</hi> and <hi>to go out before them, and fight their Battels</hi>; that is, a <hi>King</hi> who had the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme and Soveraign Authority, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.6, 19, 20. a King who should have all that Power of Government, excepting the peculiar Acts of the Priestly Office, which either their High Priest or their Judges had before.</p>
            <p>And therefore, when <hi>Samuel</hi> tells them what shall be the <hi>manner</hi> of their <hi>King, v.</hi> 11. though what he saies does necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily suppose the translation of the <hi>soveraign</hi> and <hi>irresistible Power</hi> to the <hi>Person</hi> of their <hi>King,</hi> yet it does not suppose that the King had any New Power given him, more than what was exercised formerly by their Priests and Judges. He does not deterr them from chusing a King, because a King should have greater Power, and be more unaccountable and irresistible than their other Rulers were; for <hi>Samuel</hi> himself had had as soveraign and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistible a Power as any Ki<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>g, being the Supreme Judge in <hi>Israel,</hi> whose Sentence no man could disobey or contradict, but he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred the Penalty of Death, according to the <hi>Mosaical Law.</hi> But the reason why he dissuades them from chusing a King, was because the external <hi>Pomp</hi> and <hi>Magnificence</hi> of <hi>Kings</hi> was like to be very chargeable and oppressive to them. <hi>He will take your Sons, and appoint them for himself, for his Chariots, and to be his Horsemen, and some shall run before his Chariots. And he will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point him Captains over thousands, and Captains ov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ies, and will set them to ear his Ground, and to reap his Harvest.</hi> And thus in several particulars he acquaints them what Burthens and Exactions they will bring upon themselves by setting up a King, which they were then free from: And if any Prince should be excessive in such Exactions, yet they had no way to help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: They must not resist, nor rebel against him, nor expect, that what Inconvenience they might find in Kingly Government, God would <hi>relieve and deliver them from it, when once they had chose a King: Ye shall cry out in that day, because of your King which
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60955:6"/>
ye have chosen you, and the Lord will not hear you in that day,</hi> v. 18. That is, God will not alter the Government for you again, how much soever you may complain of it.</p>
            <p>This, I say, is a plain Proof that there Kings were invested with that Soveraign Power which must not be resisted, though they oppress their Subjects to maintain their own State, and the Grandeur and Magnificence of their Kingdom. But I cannot think that these words contain the Original Grant and Charter of Regal Power, but only the translation of that Power which was formerly in their <hi>High Priests</hi> or <hi>Judges,</hi> to <hi>Kings.</hi> Kings had no more Power than their other Governours had; for there can be no Power greater than that which is irresistible; but th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

               </gap> apt to make them complain, who had not been used to such Exactions.</p>
            <p>Let us now proceed to consider, how sacred and irresistible the Persons and Authority of Kings were under the <hi>Jewish Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>; and there cannot be a plainer Example of this, than in the Case of <hi>David.</hi> He was himself anointed to be <hi>King after Saul's death,</hi> but in the mean time was grievously persecuted by <hi>Saul,</hi> pursued from one place to another, with a design to take away his Life. How now does <hi>David</hi> behave himself in this extremity? What course does he take to secure himself from <hi>Saul</hi>? Why, he takes the only course that is left a Subject; he flies for it, and hides himself from <hi>Saul</hi> in the Mountains and Caves of the Wilderness; and when he found he was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in one place, he removes to another: He kept Spies upon <hi>Saul,</hi> to observe his motions, not that he might meet him to give him Battel, or to take him at an advantage, but that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60955:7"/>
he might keep out of his way, and not fall unawares into his hands.</p>
            <p>Well, but this wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> no thanks to <hi>David,</hi> because he could do no otherwise. He was too weak for <hi>Saul,</hi> and not able to stand against him; and therefore he had no other Remedy but Flight. But yet we must consider, that <hi>David</hi> was a Man of War, he slew <hi>Goliah,</hi> and fought the Battels of <hi>Israel</hi> with great success; he was an admired and beloved Captain, which made <hi>Saul</hi> so jealous of him; the Eyes of <hi>Israel</hi> were upon him for their next King, and how easily might he have raised a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and formidable Rebellion against <hi>Saul!</hi> But he was so far from this, that he invites no man to his assistance; and when some came uninvited, he made no use of them in an offensive or defensive War against <hi>Saul.</hi> Nay, when God delivered <hi>Saul</hi> two several times into <hi>David</hi>'s hands, that he could as easily have killed him, as have <hi>cut off the skirts of his garment at</hi> Engedi, 1 Sam. 24. or as have <hi>taken that spear away which stuck in the ground at his bolster, as he did in the hill of</hi> Hachilah, 1 Sam. 26. Yet he would neither touch <hi>Saul</hi> himself, nor suffer any of the People that were with him to do it, though they were very importunate with him for liberty to kill <hi>Saul</hi>; nay, though they urged him with an Argument from Providence, that it was a plain Evidence that it was the will of God that he should kill <hi>Saul,</hi> because God had now delivered his Enemy into his hands, according to the promise He had made to <hi>David</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.4.26. <hi>ch. ver.</hi> 8. We know what use some men have made of this Argument of Providence, to justifie all the Villanies they had a mind to act: but <hi>David,</hi> it seems, did not think that an opportunity of doing evil, gave him license and authority to do it. Opportunity, we say, makes a <hi>Thief,</hi> and it makes a <hi>Rebel,</hi> and it makes a <hi>Murderer.</hi> No man can do any Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which he has no opportunity of doing; and if the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, which puts such opportunities into Mens hands, justifies the wick<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dness they commit, no man can be chargeable with any Guilt whatever he does; and certainly opportunity will as soon justifie any other Sin as Rebellion, and the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Princes. We are to learn our Duty from the Law of God, not from his Providence; at least, this must be a settled Principle, that the Providence of God will never justifie any action which this Law forbids.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:60955:7"/>And therefore, notwithstanding this opportunity which God had put into his hands to destroy his Enemy, and to take the Crown for his Reward, <hi>David</hi> considers his Duty, remembers, that though <hi>Saul</hi> were his Enemy, and that very unjustly, yet he was the <hi>Lord's Anointed. The Lord forbid,</hi> saies he, <hi>that I should do this unto my Master, the Lord's Anointed, to stretch forth my hand against him, seeing he is the Lord's Anointed.</hi> Nay, he was so far from taking away his Life, that his Heart smote him for cutting off the Skirt of his Garment. And we ought to observe the Reason <hi>David</hi> gives, why he durst not hurt <hi>Saul,</hi> Because he was the Lord's Anointed; which is the very Reason the Apostle gives in the 13. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. <hi>Because the Powers are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained of God, and he that resisteth the Power, resisteth the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God.</hi> For to be anointed of God, signifies no more, than that he was made King by God. Thus <hi>Josephus</hi> expounds beinganointed by God, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, one who had the Kingdom bestowed on him by God; and in another place, One who was ordained by God: For it seems by this Phrase, he looked upon the external Ceremony of Anointing, to be like Imposition of Hands, which in other cases consecrated Persons to peculiar Offices: For this external Unction was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a visible sign of God's designation of them to such an Office; and when that was plain, they were as much <hi>God's Anointed</hi> without this visible Unction as with it. <hi>Cyrus</hi> is called God's Anointed, though he never was anointed by any Prophet, but only designed for his Kingdom by Prophecy, 45. <hi>Isa.</hi> 1. And we never read in Scripture, that any Kings had this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Unction, who succeeded in the Kingdom by right of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, unless the Title and Succession were doubtful; and yet they were the Lord's Anointed too, that is, were placed in the Throne by him. So that this is an eternal Reason against resisting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Soveraign Princes,</hi> that they are set up by God, and invested with his Authority, and therefore their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and Authority are sacred.</p>
            <p>But yet there are some men, who from the example of <hi>David,</hi> think they can prove the lawfulness of a defensive, though not an offensive War. For <hi>David,</hi> when he fled from <hi>Saul,</hi> made himself Captain of four hundred men, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.2. which number soon encreased to six hundred, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.13.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60955:8"/>
and still every day encreased by new additions, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12.1. Now, why should he entertain these men, but to defend himself against the Forces of <hi>Saul?</hi> that is, to make a defensive War whenever he was assaulted by him.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In answer to this, I obs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rve, That <hi>David</hi> invited none of these men after him, but they came Voluntiers after a beloved Captain and General; which shews how formidable he could have made himself<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when such numbers resorted to him of their own accord.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When he had them, he never used them for any Hostile Acts against <hi>Saul,</hi> or any of his Forces; he never stood his ground, when he heard <hi>Saul</hi> was coming, but alwaies fled, and his Men with him; Men who were never used to flee, and were very ready to have served him against <hi>Saul</hi> himself, would he have permitted them. And, I suppose they will not call this a Defensive War, to flie before an Enemy, and to hide themselves in Caves and Mountains; and yet this was the only Defensive War which <hi>David</hi> made with all his Men about him: Nay, all that he would make, according to his professed Principles, <hi>That it was not lawful to stretch out his hand against the Lord's Anointed.</hi> And when these men are pursued, as <hi>David</hi> was, by an inraged and jealous Prince, we will not charge them with Rebellion, though they flie before him by thousands in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Yet there was sufficient reason why <hi>David</hi> should enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain these men, who voluntarily resorted to him, though he never intended to use them against <hi>Saul:</hi> for some of them ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for Spies, to observe <hi>Saul</hi>'s motions, that he might not be surprized by him, but have timely notice to make his escape. And the very presence of such a number of men about him, without any hostile act, preserved him from being seized on by some officious persons, who otherwise might have delivered him into <hi>Saul</hi>'s hands. And he being anointed by <hi>Samuel</hi> to be King after <hi>Saul</hi>'s death, this was the first Step to his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to have such a Retinue of valiant Men about him; which made his advancement to the Throne more easie, and discouraged any opposition which might otherwise been made against him; as we see it proved in the event, and have
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60955:8"/>
reason to believe that it was thus ordered by God, for that very end. It is certain, that <hi>Gad</hi> the Prophet, and <hi>Abiathar</hi> the Priest, who was the only man who escaped the fury of <hi>Saul,</hi> when he destroyed the Priests of the Lord, were in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s Retinue; and that <hi>David</hi> enterprized nothing, without first asking Counsel of God: But he who had anointed him to be King, now draws Forces after him, which after <hi>Saul</hi>'s death should facilitate his advancement to the Kingdom.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> It is objected further, That <hi>David</hi> intended to have stayed in <hi>Keilah,</hi> and to have fortified it against <hi>Saul,</hi> had not he been informed, That the Men of the City would have saved themselves, by delivering him up to <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. Now, to maintain any strong Hold against a <hi>Prince,</hi> is an act of War; though it be but a defensive War. And I grant it is so, but deny that there is any Appearance, that <hi>David</hi> ever intended any such thing. <hi>David</hi> and his Men, by God's appointment and direction, had fought with the Phil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>tins, and smote them with a great slaughter, and saved <hi>Keilah</hi> from them; and as it is probable, did intend to have stayed some time in <hi>Keilah</hi>: But <hi>David</hi> had heard that <hi>Saul</hi> intended to come against <hi>Kei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah,</hi> to destroy the City, and take him, and enquires of the Lord about it, and receives an answer, That <hi>Saul</hi> would come against the City. He enquires again, whethe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the Men of <hi>Kei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah</hi> would deliver him up to <hi>Saul,</hi> and was an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>wered, That they would. And upon this, he and his Men leave <hi>Keilah,</hi> and betake themselves to the strong Holds in the Wilderness.</p>
            <p>But now, it is likely, That if <hi>David</hi> had had any design to have fortified <hi>Keilah</hi> against <hi>Saul,</hi> he would have been afraid of the Men of the City: He had six hundred Men with him in <hi>Keilah,</hi> a victorious Army, which had lately destroyed the Philistines, who oppressed them; and therefore could easily have kept the Men of <hi>Keilah</hi> too in awe, if he had pleased, and have put it out of their power to deliver him to <hi>Saul.</hi> But all that <hi>David</hi> designed was, to have stayed there as long as he could, and, when <hi>Saul</hi> had drawn nigh, to have removed to some other place: But when he understood the Treacherous Inclinations of the Men of <hi>Keilah,</hi> and being resolved against all
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60955:9"/>
acts of Hostility, he hastened his remove, before <hi>Saul</hi> drew near.</p>
            <p>So that these men must find some other Example than that of <hi>David,</hi> to countenance their Rebellion against their Prince: for <hi>David</hi> never rebelled, never fought against <hi>Saul</hi>; but when he had a very potent Army with him, he and his Men alwaies fled, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>d themselves in the Wilderness and places of difficult access.</p>
            <p>The Sum is this: God, from the very beginning, set up such a Supreme and Soveraign Power in the <hi>Jewish Nation,</hi> as could not, as ought not to be resisted. This Power was at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>rst in the hands of <hi>Moses,</hi> and when <hi>Korah</hi> and his company rebelled against him, God vindicated his Authority by a miraculous Destruction of those Rebels; <hi>for the Earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up.</hi> Afterwards, when they came into <hi>Canaan,</hi> the ordinary Exercise of his Power was in the High Priests and Judges, whom <hi>God</hi> raised up, whose Sentence and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was final, and must not be resisted, under penalty of death, when the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> desired a King, this soveraign and irresistible Power was transferred to him, and settled in his Person. <hi>Saul</hi> was the first King who was chosen by God, and anointed by <hi>Samuel</hi>; but for his Disobedience, was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards rejected by God, and <hi>David</hi> the Son of <hi>Jess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>,</hi> was anointed King to succeed after <hi>Saul</hi>'s death: But in the mean time <hi>David</hi> was persecuted by <hi>Saul,</hi> who sought after his Life. And though he himself was anointed by God, and <hi>Saul</hi> rejected by him, yet he durst not p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rsist nor oppose him, nor defend himself by force against the most unjust violence, but fled for his life, and hid himself in Caves and Mountains. Nay, when <hi>Saul</hi> was delivered into his hands by God, he durst not stretch out his hand against the Lord's Anointed.</p>
            <p>Let us now consider what Christ and his Apostles taught and practised about Obedience to Soveraign Princes; whereby we may learn how far Christians are obliged by these Laws of <hi>Subjection</hi> and <hi>Non-Resistance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. I shall consider the Doctrine of Christ, while he lived on Earth: And here are several things very fit to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:60955:9"/>
               <hi>First,</hi> We have no reason to suspect, that Christ would alter the Rights of <hi>Soveraign Power,</hi> and the measures of Obedience and Subjection, which were fixt and determin'd by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. This was no part of his Commission, to change the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Forms and Polities of Civil Governments, which is an act of Secular Power and Authority, and does not belong to a <hi>Spiritual Prince.</hi> He who would not undertake to decide a petty Controversie, or to divide an Inheritance between two conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Brethren, 12. <hi>Luk.</hi> 13, 14. can we think that he would attempt any thing of that vast consequence, as the Changes and Alterations of Civil power, which would have unsettled the Fundamental Constitutions of all the Governments of the World at that time?</p>
            <p>Our Saviour tells us, <hi>That he came not to destroy the Law and the Prophets, but to fulfil it</hi>; to fill it up, to compleat and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it; <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.17. that is, to fulfill the anci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ousness; to perfect the Moral Laws with new instances and degrees of Vertue; but He abrogated no Moral Law, and therefore not the Laws of Obedience and Subjection to Princes, which has alwaies been reduced to the Fifth Commandment. Nay, he abrogated no Laws, but by perfecting and fulfilling them; and therefore he could make no alteration in the Doctrin of <hi>Non-R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sistance,</hi> which is as perfect Subjection as can or ought to be paid to Soveraign Princes. His Kingdom was not of this World, as he told <hi>Pilate</hi>: Though he was a King, he neither was an Enemy nor Rival to <hi>Caesar</hi>; but had he absolved his Disciples from their Obedience to Princes, had he made it in any case lawful to Resist (which was so expresly forbid the Jews by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and which is such a contradiction to the very Nation of Soveraign Power) he had been somewhat worse than a Rival to all the Princes of the Earth; for though he had set up no Kingdom of his own, yet he had pulled down theirs. Whereas he took great care that his Religion should give no distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance to the World, nor create any reasonable Jealousies and Suspicions to Princes, who had been very excusable for their aversion to Christianity, had he invaded the <hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>Royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> of their Crowns.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:60955:10"/>This makes it very improbable, that our Saviour should make any Alterations in Civil Powers, or abridge the <hi>Rights</hi> of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty</hi>; which is so foreign to his design of coming into the World, and so incongruous to the Person which he su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stained; and yet he could not alter the Duties of Subjects, but he must alter the Rights of Princes too; he must take away the Soveraign Power of Princes, at the same time that he makes it lawful for Subjects in any case whatsoever to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist. We may safely then conclude, That our Saviour has left the Government of the World as he found it: He has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed given such admirable Laws, as will teach Princes to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, and Subjects to obey better; which is the most effectual way to secure the publick Peace and Happiness, to prevent the Oppression of Subjects, and Rebellions against Princes: but he has not interposed in new modelling the Governments of the World, whic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> is not of such consequence as some men imagine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is not the external form of Government, but the Fatherly Care, and Prudence, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Had our Saviour given Subjects Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to Resist, to Depose, to Murder <hi>Tyrannical Princes,</hi> he had done them no kindness at all; for, to give liberty to Subjects to Resist, is only to proclaim an Universal License to Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Seditions, and Civil Wars; and if any Man can think this su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

as this takes a more effectual course to reform the Abuses of the Civil Power, and to preserve good Government in the World<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than all our <hi>wise Politicians</hi> and <hi>State-menders,</hi> who think to reform the Government of the World by some State-Spells and Charms, without reforming those who govern, and those who are governed. This our Saviour has done, and this is the best thing that could be done, nay, this was all that he could do in this matter. He never usurpt any Civil Power and Authority, and therefore could not new model the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the World: He never offers any external Force and Compulsion to make Men obey his Laws, and therefore neither forces Princes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to Rule well, nor Subjects to Obey; but he has taken the same care of the Government of the World, as he has done of all the other Duties of Piety and Vertue; that is, he has given very good Laws, and has threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned those that break them with eternal punishments; and as the Laws and Religion of our Saviour prevail, so will the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments of the World mend, without altering the Model and Constitution of them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But yet we have some positive Evidence what our Saviour taught about Obedience to the Higher Powers; I shall give you two Instances of it, which are as plain and express as can be desired.</p>

Well, they acknowledg that the Image and Superscription on the Tribute-Money was <hi>Caesar</hi>'s; upon which he replies, <hi>Render therefore unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's.</hi> The plain meaning of which Answer is this, That since by the very Impres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Whatever is due to <hi>Soveraign Princes,</hi> and does not interfere with their Duty to God, that they must give to <hi>Caesar,</hi> who at this time was their Soveraign.

            <p n="1">1. That our Saviour does not examine into <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Right, nor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:60955:11"/>2. That he does not particularly determine what the things of <hi>Caesar are,</hi> that is, what his <hi>Right is</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as a <hi>Soveraign Prince.</hi> Hence some men conclude, that this Text can prove nothing; that we cannot learn from it, what our Saviour's Judgment was in this Point; that it is only a subtil Answer, which those who ask the Question could make nothing of; which was a proper return to their ensnaring Question. This I think is as great a Reproach to our Saviour, as they can well cast upon him, that He, who was the Wisdom of God, the great <hi>Pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is true, many times our Saviour, when He discourst of what concern'd His own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, or the Mysteries of His Kingdom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which were not fit at that time to be publisht in plain terms, used a Mistical Language; as when he called his Body the <hi>Temple,</hi> or he taught them by <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,</hi> which were not obvious at the first hearing, but still what he said, had a certain and determined sense, and what was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure and difficult, he explained privately to his Apost<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>es, that in due time they might explain it to others; but to assert, as these men must do, that Christ gave them such an answer as signified nothing, and which he intended they should understand nothing by, shews that they are not so civil to our Saviour as these <hi>Pharis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But certainly the <hi>Pharisees</hi> did believe, that there was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in our Saviours answer, for <hi>they marvelled, and left him, and went their way</hi>: And yet those who had wit enough to ask such ensnaring Questions, could not be so dull as to be put off wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>For indeed can any thing be plainer than our Saviour's An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer? They ask him whether it were lawful to pay Tribute to <hi>Caesar</hi>? he does not indeed in express words say, that they should pay Tribute to <hi>Caesar,</hi> but he gives them such an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, as withal convinc'd them of the Reason and Necessity of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60955:12"/>
it. He asks whose Image and superscription was on the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute-Money; they tell him <hi>Caesars</hi>; from whence he infers, <hi>Render therefore unto</hi> Caesar <hi>the things that are</hi> Caesar's. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? Wherefore?</hi> because the Tribute-Money had <hi>Caesars</hi> Image on it; therefore they must render to <hi>Caesar the things that are Caesars</hi>; which certainly signifies that <hi>Tribute</hi> was one of those things which belonged to <hi>Caesar,</hi> and must be rendred to him, as appeared by having <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Image: Not as if every thing that had <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Mark and Stamp on it, did belong unto <hi>Caesar,</hi> and must be given to him, (as some Men profanely enough, how wittily soever they imagine, burlesque and Ridicule our Saviour's Answer) for at this Rate all the Mony of the Empire, which bore his Image, was <hi>Caesars</hi>; but the Money which was stampt with <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Image, and was the current Money of the Nation, was a plain sign, as I observed before, that he was their Soveraign, and paying Tribute was a known Right due to Soveraign Princes; and therefore the very Money which they used, with <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Image on it, resolved that Question, not only of the lawfulness, but the necessity of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tribute: and this was so plain an Answer, that the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees were ashamed of their Question, and went away with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making any Reply; for they no more dared to deny that <hi>Caesar</hi> was their King, than they thought he dared either to own or deny the lawfulness of paying Tribute to <hi>Caesar.</hi> And this was all the subtilty of our Saviour's Answer</p>
            <p>But then, our Saviour not confining his Answer meerly to the Case of paying Tribute, but answering in general, That we must <hi>render to Caesar the things that are Caesar</hi>'s, extends this to all the Rights of Soveraign Princes, and so becomes a stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Rule in all Cases, to give to <hi>Caesar</hi> what is <hi>Caesar</hi>'s due. And when our Saviour commands us to <hi>render to Caesar the things which are Caesar's,</hi> w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r from making his Answer doubtful and ambiguous, and of no use in this present Controversie, that it suggests to us three plain and natural Consequences, which are sufficient to end this whole Dispute.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That our Saviour did not intend to mak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ny alteration in the Rights of Sove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aignty, but what Rights he found Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Princes possest of, he leaves them in the quiet possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60955:12"/>
of; for had he intended to make any change in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he would not have given such a general Rule, to <hi>render to</hi> Caesar <hi>the things which are</hi> Caesar<hi>'s,</hi> without specifying what these things are.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And therefore he leaves them to the known Laws of the <hi>Empire,</hi> to determine what is <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Right. Whatever is essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to the Nation of Soveraign Power, whatever the Laws an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Customs of Nations determine to be <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Right, that they must render to him; for he would make no alteration in this matter. So that subjection to <hi>Princes,</hi> and <hi>Non-Resistance,</hi> is as plainly determined by our Saviour in this Law, as paying of <hi>Tribute</hi>; for Subjection and <hi>Non-Resistance</hi> is as essential a Right of <hi>Soveraign Power,</hi> and as inseparable from the notion of it, as any thing can be. So it is acknowledged by the Laws and Customs of Nations; and so it is determined by the Apostle St. <hi>Paul</hi>; as I shall shew hereafter.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I observe farther, That when our Saviour enjoins our Duty to our <hi>Prince,</hi> with our Duty to our <hi>God, render to</hi> Caesar <hi>the things which are</hi> Caesar<hi>'s, and to God, the things which are God's.</hi> He excepts nothing from <hi>Caesar's Rights,</hi> which by the Laws of Nations is due to Soveraign Princes, but what is a violation of, and an encroachment on God's Right and Soveraignty; that is, we must pay all that Obedience and Subjection to Princes, which is consistent with our Duty to God. This is the only limit our Saviour sets to our Duty to Princes. If they should command us to renounce our Religion, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship false gods; if they sho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ld challenge Divine Honours to themselves, as some of the Roman Emperors did; this we must not do, because it is to renounce Obedience and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to God, who has a more Soveraign power, and a greater Right in us than our Prince: But all <hi>Active</hi> and <hi>Passive Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> which is consistent with a good Conscience towards God, and required of us by the Laws of our Country, and the essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Rights of Soveraignty, is what we owe to our Prince, and what by our Saviour's Command we must render to him.</p>
            <p>This, I hope, is sufficient for the explication of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Answer to the <hi>Pharisees</hi> and <hi>Herodians</hi>; which evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60955:13"/>
contains the Doctrin of Obedience and Subjection to Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, enforced on us by the Authority of our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
            <p>Having seen what the Doctrin of our Saviour was, let us now consider his <hi>Practice:</hi> And we need not doubt, but our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our lived as he preacht. He taught his Disciples by his Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as well as by his Laws. His Life was the best Comment upon his Sermons; was a visible Lecture of Universal Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness and Goodness; and it is impossible to conceive a more perfect and absolute example of <hi>Subjection</hi> and <hi>Non-Resistance,</hi> than our Saviour has set us.</p>
            <p>When our Saviour appeared in the World, the <hi>Jews</hi> were very weary of the <hi>Roman Yoke,</hi> and in earnest expectat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60955:13"/>
besides women and children, with five barly loaves, and two small fishes:</hi> and what a formidable Enemy would he have been, who could Victual an Army by Miracles, and could, when he pleased, conquer by the same miraculous Power also? This the people, whom he had miraculously fed, were very sensible of, and did hence conclude, That <hi>he was the</hi> Prophet <hi>that should come into the World,</hi> and that it was time to take him, and set him upon the Throne: But though our Saviour was indeed the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias,</hi> yet he was not such a <hi>Messias,</hi> as they expected; he was not a Temporal Prince, and therefore would not countenance their Rebellion against <hi>Caesar,</hi> though it were to make himself a King.</p>
            <p>It is sufficiently known, That Christ submitted to the most unjust Sentence, to the most ignominious and painful death, rather than resist the <hi>Higher Powers,</hi> though he could so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily have <hi>called for Legions of Angels to his rescue; but he went as a lamb to the slaughter, and as the sheep before the shearer is dumb, so he opened not his mouth: when he was reviled, he reviled not again: when he suffered, he threatned not, but committed himself to him who judgeth righteously.</hi> He rebuked <hi>Peter</hi> when he drew his Sword in his defence, and tells <hi>Pilate</hi> the reason why he was so easily apprehended, and used at their pleasure, without any resistance and opposition, though he had been formerly attended with such crowds of his Disciples; because he was no Temporal Prince, and therefore did not require his <hi>Disciples</hi> to fight for him, as other Temporal Princes used to do. <hi>Iesus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, my Kingdom is not of this World: if my Kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Jews; but now is my Kingdom not from hence,</hi> Joh. 18.36. Which plainly shews, That our Saviour's subjection was not matter of force and constraint, because he wanted power to resist; but it was matter of choice, that which was most agreeable to the nature of his Kingdom, which was not to be propagated by carnal Weapons, but by Suffering and Death.</p>
            <p>And when our Saviour has set us such an Example as this, it is wonderful to me, that any, who call themselves his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, can think it lawful to rebel against their Prince, and defend themselves from the most unjust Violence, by a more unjust Resistance. But there are few men, who are conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60955:14"/>
to follow Christ to the Cross; they do not like that part of his Example, and are willing to perswade themselves, that they are not bound to imitate it. And there are two things which I find urged by some men to this purpose, which must be briefly considered.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it is no wonder, that Christ suffered patiently and quietly, without resisting the most unjust Violence, because he came into the World to die, and to make his Soul an Offering for Sin. And how could so innocent a person die, but by the Hands of <hi>Vnjust</hi> and <hi>Tyrannical Powers?</hi> And it was inconsistent with his Design of dying for Sin, to resist and oppose. This is the account our Saviour himself gives of his patient suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. When St. <hi>Peter</hi> drew his Sword in his defence, he tells him, <hi>Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he sha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The design of the Apostle, as you shall hear more presently, was to forbid all Resistance of Soveraign Princes; and had he known of any men, who might lawfully r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:60955:15"/>The reason he assigns why every soul must be subject to the higher Powers, is, Becaus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> 
               <hi>all powers are of God</hi>; so that whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is bound to be subject to God, must be subject to their Prince, who is in God's stead. And this, I think, will reach the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> as well as any private Christian; unless he will pretend to have more Authority on Earth than God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self has; for the Prince has God's Authority, and therefore cannot be resisted, but by a greater Authority than God's. And, by the same reason, if the whole Body of the people be subject to God, they must be subject to their Prince too, because he acts by God's Au<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hority and Commission. Were a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Prince the Peoples Creature, that might be a good Maxim: <hi>Rex major singulis, sed minor universis</hi>; that the King is greater than any particular Subject, but less than All together: but if he be God's Minister, he is upon that account as much greater than All, as God is.</p>
            <p>And that the whole Body of the People, all together, as well as one by one, are equally concerned in this Command, of being subject to the <hi>Higher Powers,</hi> is evident, from this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration: That nothing less than this will secure the Peace and Tranquility of Human Societies: The Resistance of single persons is more dangerous to themselves than to the Prince, but a powerful Combination of Rebels is formidable to the most puissant Monarchs. The greater number of Subjects rebel against their Prince, the more too they distress his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and threaten his Crown and Dignity, and his Person and Authority be sacred, the greater the Violence is which is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to him, the greater is his Crime.</p>
            <p>Had the Apostle exhorted the <hi>Romans</hi> after this manner: Let no private and single man be so foolish, as to rebel against his Prince, who will be too strong for him; but if you can raise sufficient Forces to oppose against him; if you can all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to depose or murder him, this is very innocent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and justifia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, nay, an Heroical Atchievement, which becomes a free born people: How would this secure the Peace and Quiet of the World? How would this have agreed with what follows, That Princes are advanced by God, and that to resist our Prince, is to resist the Ordinance of God, and that such men shall be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely punisht for it, in this World or the next? For, can the Apostle be thought absolutely to condemn Resistance, if he

makes it only unlawful to resist, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Nor can there be any Reason assigned, why the Apostle should lay so strict a Command on particul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:60955:16"/>Thus I am sure it is in our Government, where <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> assembled in <hi>Parliament</hi> own themselves the Subjects of the <hi>King,</hi> and have by publick Laws disclaimed all Power of raising any <hi>War,</hi> either <hi>offensive</hi> or <hi>defensive against the King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having heard what St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Doctrine was, let us now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what St. <hi>Peter</hi> taught about this matter: he had as much reason to learn this Lesson as any of the Apostles, our Saviour having severally rebuked him for drawing his Sword against the lawful Powers, as you have already heard. And indeed his rash and intemperate zeal in this Action cost him very dear; for we have reason to believe, that this was the chief thing, that tempted him to deny his Master. He was afraid to own himself to be his Disciple, or that he had been in the Garden with him; because he was conscious to himself, that by draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Sword, and smiting the Servant of the <hi>High-Priest,</hi> he had incurred the penalty of the Law, and had he been discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, could expect nothing less, but to be severely punish'd for it, it may be to have lost his Life for his resistance. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, this has very often been the fate of those men, who have been transported with a boistrous and intemperate Zeal to draw their Swords for their Master and his Religion, against the lawful Powers, that they commonly deny their Master, and despise his Religion, before they put their swords up again.</p>
            <p>But St. <hi>Peter</hi> having, by our Saviour's Reproof, and his own dear-bought Experience, learnt the Evil of Resistance, neve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> drew his Sword more, and took great care to instruct Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, not to do so; 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13, 14, 15, 16. <hi>Submit your selves to every Ordinance of Man, for the Lord's sake, whether it be to the King, as supreme; or unto Governours, as to them that are sent by him, for the punishment of evil-doers, and for the praise of them that do well.

            </p>
            <p>This is the very same Doctrin which St. <hi>Paul</hi> taught the <hi>Romans: Let every soul be subj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ct to the higher powers</hi>; for the same word is used in the Original, and therefore to submit, and to be subject, is the same thing, which, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, signifies <hi>Non-Resistance</hi>; only St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of not resisting the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60955:16"/>
               <hi>Higher Powers</hi>; that is, Emperors and Soveraign Princes, herein including all those who act by their Authority; S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> to prevent all Cavils and Exceptions, distinctly mentions both, That we must submit to all humane Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, not only to the <hi>King as Supreme,</hi> that is, in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s phrase, to the <hi>Higher Powers,</hi> to all Soveraign Princes, who are invested with the supreme Authority; but also to those who are sent by him, who receive their Authority and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission from the Soveraign Prince.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us at large, That <hi>all Power is of God,</hi> and that the power is the Minister of God; <hi>and he that resisteth the power, resisteth the ordin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               <hi>Submit your self to every Ordinance of Man, for the Lord's sake</hi>: for, How is God concerned in our Obedience to Princes, if they be not his Ministers, who are appointed and advanced by him, and act by his Authority, and if it be not his Will and Command that we should obey them? and therefore he adds, <hi>For this is the will of God, that with well-doing,</hi> (that is by obedience and subjection to Princes) <hi>ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men</hi>; that is, that you may put to silence those foolish men, who ignorantly accuse you, as fond of Changes, and troublesome and dangerous to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But then, St. <hi>Peter</hi> observing, that Christian Liberty was made a pretence for Seditions and Treasons, he cautions them against that also; <hi>As free, but not using your liberty for a cloak of maliciousness</hi>; that is, to cover and excuse such wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness as Rebellion against Princes, but as the servants of God: You must remember whatever Freedom Christ has purchased for you, he has not delivered you from Obedience and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to God; you are His servants still, and therefore must be subject to those, who receive their Power and Authority from God, as all Soveraign Princes do.</p>
            <p>This is as plain, one would think, as words can make it; but nothing can be so plain, but that Men, who are unwilling to understand, and who set their wits on work to avoid the force and evidence of it, may be able to find something to say, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive

themselves, and those who are willing to be deceived: and therefore it will be necessary to consider what false Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours some men have put upon these words, to elude and baffle the plain scope and design of the Apostle in them.</p>
            <p>As, first, they observe, that St. <hi>Peter</hi> calls Kings and subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Governours an Ordinance of Man, or a human Creature, and from hence they conclude, that Kings are only the <hi>Peoples Creatures</hi>; they are made by the people, and receive their Power from them, and therefore are accountable to them if they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and St. <hi>Peter</hi> may be reconciled.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eceive their power from God; That they are God's, and not the peoples Ministers. Now, though St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> did once differ upon a matter of Prudence, it would be of ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence to Religion, to make them differ in so material a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine as this is; and yet there is no way to reconcile them, but by expounding St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s words, so as to agree with St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s; for St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s words can never be reconciled with that sence which these men give of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s; and that is a good Argument to me, that is not the true interpretation of St. <hi>Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Ordinance of God, and Princes receive their power from him.

               <p>LET us have a care of our Zeal, that we may not mistake an earthly Fire, which burns and consumes, for that Divine and harmless flame, which is kindled at God's Altar. A true Zeal for Religion is nothing more, nor less, than such a hearty Love for it, as makes us very diligent in the practice of it our selves, and very industrious to promote the knowledg and practice of Religion in the World, by all lawful and prudent means. A true Christian Zeal will not suffer us to transgress the strict bounds of our Duty to God, or of our Duty to Men, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes,</hi> whatever flattering prospect of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage it may give. To lye, to forswear our selves, to hate and revile each other; to reproach and libel Governours in Church and State; to stir up or countenance, with the least thought, any seditious practices against the King or Government, is not a Zeal for God, nor for Religion; for, <hi>this Wisdom is not from above, but is earthly, sensual, and devilish</hi>; for where Strife and Contention is, there is C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
