            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:10527:9"/>
it oughte otherwyse to bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standed, than ye doe expounde it.

And in an other place, he wyth the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Apostles sayth plainly thus: better it is to obeye God than ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.<note place="margin">Actes. 5.</note> Wherfore master person, we must necessarely note here, that there be .2. kynds of ordeinaunces of man.

And not wythoute a good cause doeth the Lorde threaten, that he wyll doe thus: for sithens thei doe preferre their own wisdom before the wysedome of God, doe they

not well deserue (I praye you) to haue that wisdome, whiche God had geuen them for to bestowe to hys own glory, to be taken awaye from them? So that the saying of S.

               <p>I say stil, that subiectes ought not to busy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues about Princes matters. For as ye heard already, if their lawes bee naughte and wycked, then

               <p>And thys is the other kynde of ordeinaunces made by manne, wherunto, as I haue sayd before, we ought to be obedyent, and that wythoute any exceptyon, as farre

               <p>Howbeit, if both the Greke and la<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tyne be well weyed, we shal soone perceaue that Peter doeth here set forth the same selfe doctrine, which Paul himselfe doeth teache in the 13. to the Romaynes: for the Greke wordes are these: hypotagete pase anthropine ctisei, and Erasmus doeth translate them after thys maner: Subditi estote cuiuis hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane creature.</p>
               <p>And in Englyshe they may be translated thus: be subiecte to all humayne creature, or to all menne. For although thys worde, ctisis, may be taken for ordeynaunce: yet by the texte that foloweth, it appea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>peareth

it ought rather to be taken as Erasmus hath tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>slated.

               <p>Cyrillus writing vpon Ihon, speaketh these woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des: Truely it lyeth onely in the power of God to louse men from their synnes. For who can deliuer the transgressors of the law from synne, but onely the autour of the lawe? And by and by it foloweth in the same place: For when they (meaninge the Apostles &amp; other ministers) forgeue and retayne synnes, it is not they that do it, but the holy Ghost that dwelleth in them, he it is that forgeueth &amp; retayneth by them. Whereunto agreeth sainct Augustin, writing contra epistolam Petiliani.<note place="margin">Aug. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tra epi. Peti. lib. 2. ca. 11.</note> For, hauing touched this place of S. Ihons gospell: Receyue the holy Ghoste, whose synnes soeuer ye forgeue, thei shalbe forgeuen, and whose synnes soeuer ye retayne, thei shalbe retayned, he doth ende
<pb facs="tcp:10527:34"/>
the matter with these wordes: It is sufficientlye shewed, that they do it not, but that the holy Ghost doeth it by them. As it is sayed in an other place: for it is not you y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> speake, but the holye Ghoste that is in you. In lyke maner Ambrose vpon the .2. Corin. 12.<note place="margin">Ambro. in 2. Cor. 12.</note> wryteth on this manner: It is only in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of God too remitte synnes &amp; to geue the holye Ghoste. And agayne: He alone doeth forgeue synne, that alone dyed for oure synnes.</p>
               <p>Lykewise Chrisostome vpon Matthewe:<note place="margin">Chryso. in Mattheu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ho. 5.</note> The seruitude and boundage of synne, sayeth he, is very greuous and heauye, frome the whiche no manne can deliuer but God onely. For no man besy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des God hathe power to remitte or forgeue synne. Cyprian in hys sermones De lapsis saieth plainly thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:10527:35"/>The Lord alone can shew mercy, and geue pardon of those synnes: that are committed againste hym, he alone can graunt forgeuenesse of our synnes, that did beare our synnes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> sorowed for vs, whome God did deliuer vp to deathe for our synnes. Is it not than a blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy intollerable, and in nowise to be suffered in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church of Christ that suche vyle persons, that haue neither godlinesse nor learninge, shoulde take vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that thing, that apperteineth only to god?

Secondely, where ye saye, that Christe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded his Apostles, too louse and vnbynde Lazarus, ye ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not proue it by the scriptures. For it is rather to be thoughte, that he willed the Iewes, that stode by, to doe it, lest they shoulde thinke, that there was anye feininge in the myracle, and that his power myghte the better bee knowen,
<pb facs="tcp:10527:37"/>
in this, that he did without tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinge, with his worde and voice onely, rayse the dead.</p>
               <p>It is rather too be expounded after this manner: Christe, to take awaye all euell suspition from the Iewes, commaunded that they should fyrst take awaie the stone, that they should smel the stynche, haue sure tokens of hys death, see hym beinge raysed agayne, by the onelye power and vertue of hys worde, and touche or handle hym first, after he was reliued.

thys historie: that Christ by thys facte wolde admonish vs, that we shoulde louse theym, whome he had raysed, that is to say, that we should not beare in remembrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce those synnes, that he hym self had forgotten, or that we shoulde not conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne them as synners, whom he had quyted &amp; assoyled: agayn, that wee shoulde not vpbraye the synnes, which he him selfe hadde forgeuen: or where he is merciful hym self, and reddy too forgeue, we shoulde not be cruell, and bent to vengeaunce.
