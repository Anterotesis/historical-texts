         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:38272:3"/>
to be the <hi>Grand Seigniours</hi> of the World, when compared with this Grand Machine, they are like <hi>Atomes</hi> in the Sun-shine of Worldly Felicity. I could wish every man could abridge His Ambition, as the Describers of the World have Epitomized their Discovery, and Govern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by the Example of its History; which is here truly and compendiously recited. Wherein we may see how near a piece the two Globes are; and that which we call the New World, is no Changeling from the Old, War and Strife being as natural there as among us.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>THe Heavens declare the Glory of God, and the Firmament sheweth the work of his hands,</hi> Psal. 19. 1. In the Creation of which and the whole earth, and sea, and all things therein contained, of mear nothing within the compass of six dayes; and in this wise and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ordering and guiding of all things, is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly set forth his infinite, and unutterable wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, power, greatness, and goodness: His end herein is first and chiefly for his own glory, <hi>The Lord made all things for himself,</hi> Prov. 16. 4. And secondly, mens happiness, unto whom
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:38272:6"/>
the dominion of all things was under God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. <hi>Psalm.</hi> 8. 6.</p>
            <p>That men may come therefore to some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding thereof, I shall first speak of the Heavenly and of the Earthly Globes, and the several matters incident thereunto. Then I shall also make a brief description of the four parts of the earth, and the Countries in each part, the several Religions professed in them; with the varieties of Trade and Commodities therein, never yet set forth in a Treatise of this nature.</p>
            <p>The whole world therefore is divided into two parts, Etherial or Celestial, and Elemental; Of which there are two Globes accordingly, the heavenly and the earthly. Now a Globe is a proportionable representation of the heavens or of the earth; the Etherial, Celestial, or heavenly part doth compasse the Terrestial or earthly, and containeth the ten upper Spheres, or nearest un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the earth, 1 the <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The rest of the Spheres have contrary motions, every one in his kind, though far flower than the other, and the motions are contrary from the west to the east; and so are carried about oftentimes by the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:38272:6"/>
first mover, before they make one perfect revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution in themselves.</p>
            <p>The Crystalline or ninth Sphere his motion is almost insensible, and is called the Trembling motion, performed (according to the opinion of latter Astronomers) in four thousand nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years.</p>
            <p>The eighth Sphere being the Starry firmament, in seven thousand years, the Sphere of <hi>Saturn</hi> in thirty years, of <hi>Iupiter</hi> in twelve years, <hi>Mars</hi> in two years, the Sun passeth the Zodiack in three hundred sixty five dayes, <hi>Venus</hi> ends her course in somewhat more than a year, <hi>Mercury</hi> holds equal pace with the Sun. and the Moon courseth about the Heavens once every eight and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty dayes.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the Coelestial or heavenly part of the world, wherein I shall need say nothing of the Religion of Angels, and the spirits of just men made perfect, seeing it is manifest enough to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one, that there they keep their first estate; The Religion also of the fallen Angels (who are held by many to be thrust out of Heaven, and to abide in the Air, whereupon <hi>Sathan</hi> is called <hi>the Prince of the Air,</hi> Eph. 2. 2.) is so notorious for enmity against God, and all manner of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness; that poor man is more sentient of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, for their tentations, then furnished with words to express their wickednesse to the life.</p>
            <p>The Elemental part of the World is fourfold,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:38272:7"/>
earth, water, air, fire, as may be seen in that round Figure of the frame of the heavens and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements one within another; the inmost and middlemost circle containing earth and water in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixed together; the next the three Regions of the air; and immediately above that Orb is the element of fire: all which you may easily discern by their several names in their proper places. And thus much shall suffice to have spoken of the Globe of the whole World.</p>
            <p>I shall now speak first generally and briefly of the Globe of the whole Earth, and things inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent thereunto; then more particularly of the several parts thereof, and every remarkable Country in each part, as I promised in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</p>
            <p>The Globe of the earth therefore is defined to be a spherical body proportionably composed of earth and water, the two parts thereof.</p>
            <p>The parts of the earth are either real or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary.</p>
            <p>The real parts are either Continents or Islands, A Continent is a great quantity of Land not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlaced or separated by the Sea, wherein many Kingdomes and Principalites are contained; as <hi>Europe, Asia, Africa,</hi> and <hi>America.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An Island, called in Latin <hi>insula quasi in salo,</hi> is a part of the earth environed round with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; as <hi>Brittain, Iava,</hi> St. <hi>Laurence Isle, Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moodes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now these again are sub-divided into a Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>insula;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:38272:7"/>
Isthmus, and a Promontory. A peninsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la is such a tract of Land, which being almost in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compassed round by waters, is nevertheless joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the firm land by some little Isthmus, as <hi>Peloponesus, Taurica, Cymbrica,</hi> and <hi>Pervana.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An Isthmus is a little narrow neck of land which joyneth any peninsula to the Continent; as the straits of <hi>Dariene</hi> in <hi>Peru,</hi> and <hi>Corinth</hi> in <hi>Greece.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Promontory is some high mountain which shooteth it self into the Sea, the utmost end of which is called a <hi>Cape:</hi> as that great <hi>Cape</hi> of good hope; and <hi>Cape Verde</hi> in <hi>Africa, Cape Gomerie</hi> in <hi>Asia,</hi> and that of St. <hi>Michaels</hi> mount in <hi>Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall,</hi> the North <hi>Cape</hi> in <hi>Norway,</hi> and divers others.</p>
            <p>There are also other real parts of the earth, as mountains, valleys, fields, plains, woods, and the like.</p>
            <p>The other general part of the Globe is the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, divided into the Ocean. Secondly, the Sea. Thirdly, the Straights. Fourthly, Creeks.</p>
            <p>The Ocean is the general collection of all wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which invironeth the whole world on every side.</p>
            <p>The Sea is part of the Ocean, to which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come, but through some strait, as the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean Sea, the Baltick Sea, and the like.</p>
            <p>These two take their names either from the adjacent places, as the Brittish Ocean, the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man sea, the Atlantick sea, and the like: Or from
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:38272:8"/>
the first Discoverer, as the <hi>Magellanick</hi> sea, <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bushers</hi> Straits; or from some remarkable acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, as the Red-sea from the red colour of the sands, and the like.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, a Straight is a part of the Ocean, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained within narrow bounds, and opening a way to the sea, as the Straits of <hi>Gibralter, Helle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spont, Anian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, a Creek is a crooked shore, thrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth as it were two arms, to embrace and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately to hold the Sea, as the <hi>Adriatick, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian,</hi> and <hi>Corinthian</hi> Creek. Hitherto belong Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, Brooks, and Fountains, engendred of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed air in the earths concavities, and seconded by Sea-waters, creeping through hidden crannies thereof.</p>
            <p>Thus much of the real parts of the Earth in general.</p>
            <p>The compass of the whole earth is cast by our latest learned Geographers, twenty one thousand six hundred English miles, which we thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute. We see by continued experience, that the Sun for every degree in the heavens, gains sixty miles upon the earth towards his circuit round, and after three hundred sixty degrees returneth to the same point in respect of us as before it was. Add the number of sixty so oft, and you will find the account the same, and so by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the circumference to the Diameter, which is, <hi>tripla sesqui septima,</hi> the same which twenty two hath to seven.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:38272:8"/>
We may count likewise the earths thickness to the center: The whole Diameter by rule being less than a third part of the circuit. That in the proportion to twenty one thousand six hundred, will be six thousand eight hundred seventy two, half the number will reach the middle of the world, and that is, three thousand four hundred thirty six, being considered with great exactness, as the measure of such a great bulk as the earth is, can easily be taken and comprehended.</p>
            <p>Geographers attribute unto the earth five circles.</p>
            <p>The first is the Equinoctial; when the Sun in his course is come thereunto, about the eleventh of <hi>March</hi> and <hi>September,</hi> the day and the night are of equal length through the whole earth. It is also termed the Equator, and by the Sea-faring men the middle Line; because it divideth the earth into two equal parts, of which the one ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth towards the north, the other towards the south, and because it is in the middest between the two poles of the world, one in the north, the other in the south. The second circle is called the Tropick of the Crabb, because when the Sun is come thither about the tenth of <hi>Iune,</hi> it returneth by little and little unto the Equator. And then unto them that dwell on the north-side of the Equator, is the day longest; and shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test to them that dwell on the south-side thereof. This circle is distinct from the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial Twenty three Degrees, three Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:38272:9"/>
and an half, Northward.</p>
            <p>The third is called the Tropick of Capricorn, because the Sun being come thereto on the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth of <hi>December,</hi> turneth his course backward to the Equator; and then contrariwise, to them who live on the north of the Equator is the day shortest, and longest to them on the south there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; it is distant from the Equinoctial southward twenty three degrees, thirty one minutes and an half.</p>
            <p>The fourth is called the Artickcircle; the fifth the Antartick; of which the one is distant twenty three degrees, thirty one minutes and an half from the north pole; the other just so many from the south pole. And are described by the revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of heaven from the poles of the Zodiack, which is the Sun. <hi>Mercator</hi> the ancient Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer understood by the Arctick circle not onely that aforesaid, but also every circle whose half Diameter answereth to the pole in any place whatsoever, and containeth, according to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of every Countrey, certain stars, which never set, but alwayes are above the earth; so that in all regions differing in Latitude, this circle is diverse, as also is the Antartick. Now the four lesser circles, the two Tropicks and polar circles, do fitly part the earth into five Zones, that is to say girdles, because they compass, like bands, the round Globe of the earth. The first of these Zones lyeth under the Artick or north circle, and is called the cold north Zone; the second
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:38272:9"/>
lyeth under the Antartick or south circle, and is called the cold south Zone; the third is situate in the middle between the two Tropicks called the scorched Zone; the fourth lyeth under that which is between the north circle and the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick of <hi>Cancer,</hi> and is called the temperate north Zone; the fifth also is under that space which is between the Tropick of Capricorn and the south circle, and is called the temperate south Zone.</p>
            <p>Now to understand rightly the situation of Countries, their Longitude and Latitude accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the mind of Geographers is to be known. The Latitude of places which with the height of the Pole is alwayes one, beginning at the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial, is taken two manner of wayes; either to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the south, or toward the north, unto the number ninety. The Longitude is returned from the Meridian circle, and about the west Islands called <hi>Carva</hi> and <hi>Flores,</hi> beginning right at the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quator easterly, and running forwards unto the number three hundred sixty. As for example, <hi>London</hi> lyeth from the Equinoctial northward, fifty one degrees and a half, which is the Latitude; and the Longitude thereof is twenty degrees an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering unto that degree of the Equinoctial, reckoning from the Meridian.</p>
            <p>And now that I have briefly touched upon the Longitude and Latitude of Countries, and having often spoke of the Meridian and Horizon: I shall, I hope, not unprofitably take time in a word or two, to tell you what each of them are.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:38272:10"/>
The Meridian is a great circle rounding the earth from pole to pole. There are many Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians according to the divers places in which a man liveth. But the chief and first Meridian pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth through the Islands Saint <hi>Michael</hi> and of the <hi>Azores.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Horizon is a great circle, designing so great a space of the earth as a quick sight can ken in an open field: the use of it is to discern the divers ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings and settings of the stars.</p>
            <p>I shall now speak a little of the Climates, and Parallels, and then, I hope, I have done with things generally concerning the earth.</p>
            <p>A Climate is a space of the earth included within the space of two parallels.</p>
            <p>The use of them is to shew the difference of length and shortnesse of dayes over all the world, as you may see in the midst of every climate, the number of the longest day in the year, under that climate; the longest day in one climate dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering half an hour from the longest of another, so that there are twenty four climates, consisting of forty eight parallels, ere the day come to be twenty four hours of length, which is twelve hours longer than the Equinoctial day is. Now under the Equinoctial line, and thirteen degrees, that is, three parallels on either side thereof, the dayes exceed not the length of Twelve hours, but after in every clime encrease the length of half an hour; and when they come to forty eight parallels and twenty four climates
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:38272:10"/>
(as I said before) the dayes being then twenty four hours long, their increase is then by whole weeks and months, till in the twenty fourth clime about the pole, the day is full half a year long; and as it is thus between the Equator and the north pole, so it is between the said Equator and the south pole: wherefore there are two sorts of climes, that is, twenty four northern, and as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny southern: touching the names of which and other circumstances, I shall say nothing here, but leave the readers to other more large discourses, thinking this enough in a Tract of this nature to have spoken of things generally concerning the whole earth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The whole Earth is now divided into four parts.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>Europe.</item>
               <item>Asia.</item>

               <item>America.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Of each part, and their several Regions, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires, Kingdoms, Dominions, Common-wealths, Titles of honours and Laws, as briefly as I can, together also with their sundry trade and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Europe,</hi> though the least of the three first parts of the world, nevertheless excelleth all other parts in worthiness, power, renown, multitudes of well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>builded Cities, and of People skilful in all kind of arts; also excelling in virtue, and the knowledge of God, better than all the riches of the world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:38272:11"/>
Through the Grecian and Romane Empire in it: it hath had once the Dominion over <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Africa.</hi> Mr. <hi>Heylin</hi> mentions in it fourteen mother Tongues, which I will not stand now to name.</p>
            <p>It hath plenty of grain, plants, fruits, coals, rivers, and fountains of admirable virtue; it needs nothing but what may be well spared, as hot spices, not so fit for our temper; precious jewels, the nourishers of vain and soul-destroying pride; and wild beasts which cause desarts where they breed; yet of gold, silver, and other commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties it hath a part: it is divided on the east from <hi>Asia,</hi> partly by the Rivers <hi>Duina</hi> and <hi>Tunnis,</hi> and partly by the lake called <hi>Meotis,</hi> now termed <hi>Mare de le Zabacche, &amp; pont Euxine,</hi> or <hi>Mare Maggiore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From <hi>Africa</hi> it is severed by the midland Sea; on the west and north side it hath the great Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. I shall follow Mr. <hi>Heylin</hi>'s method in the description of the Regions and Countries thereof, beginning with, first, <hi>Italy,</hi> then going, secondly, to the <hi>Alps,</hi> thirdly <hi>France,</hi> fourthly <hi>Spain,</hi> fifthly <hi>Brittain,</hi> sixthly <hi>Belgia,</hi> seventhly <hi>Germany,</hi> eighthy <hi>Denmark,</hi> ninethly <hi>Swetheland,</hi> tenthly <hi>Russia,</hi> eleventhly <hi>Poland,</hi> twelfthly <hi>Hungary,</hi> thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenthly <hi>Solavonia,</hi> fourteenthly <hi>Dacia,</hi> and the fifteenth <hi>Greece;</hi> speaking of the several Islands as they relate to some or other of the greater Countries.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Italy,</hi> the Mother of all Latine Learning,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:38272:11"/>
stretcheth out easterly on <hi>Asia,</hi> between the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driatick and Thuscan Seas, and borders towards the west upon <hi>France,</hi> and towards the north on <hi>Germany,</hi> and is severed from those countries by the river <hi>Varus,</hi> and the mountains called <hi>Alpes,</hi> the rest being compassed with the Sea. It hath had seven kinds of Government, first Kings, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Consuls, third Dictators, forth Decemviri, fifth Tribunes, sixth Emperours, seventh Popes. It flourished most in the time of Christ, and a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle afterwards by means of the great and wide dominion of the mighty city of <hi>Rome,</hi> which then reigned as Queen of the world, over many Lands of <hi>Europe, Asia,</hi> and <hi>Africa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This land excelleth all the lands of <hi>Europe,</hi> in fruitfulness and pleasantness, the inhabitants are witty, industrious, and frugal, yet hot and lascivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. And withall the men very jealous, and that taken to be not without cause. The religion there now professed, is the Popish religion, unto which they are more straightly kept by the Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>The chief Wares which are carried out of <hi>Italy</hi> into other Countries, are rice, silks, velvets, sat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins, taffaties, grogrems, rashes, stamels, bum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>basins, fustians, felts serving for Clokes, costly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras, gold and silver thred, allum, galls, Venetian drinking and looking-glasses. It containeth at this day the Kingdoms of <hi>Naples, Sicily,</hi> and <hi>Sardinia,</hi> the lands and patrimony of the Church so called, which the Pope posseth; the great Dukedomes
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:38272:12"/>
of <hi>Urbin</hi> and <hi>Tuscany,</hi> the Common-wealths of <hi>Venice, Genoa,</hi> and <hi>Luca,</hi> and the estates of <hi>Lumbardy,</hi> being the Dukedomes of <hi>Millain, Mantua, Modena, Parma, Monferrat,</hi> and the Principality of <hi>Piemont;</hi> of all which I shall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve somewhat.</p>
            <p>The Kingdome of <hi>Naples</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> is enviro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned on all sides with the <hi>Adriatick, Ionian,</hi> and <hi>Tuscan</hi> Seas, excepting where it joyneth on the west to the Lands of the Church, from which se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated by a line drawn from the mouth of the River <hi>Tronto</hi> or <hi>Druentus,</hi> falling into the Adria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, to the spring head of <hi>Axofenus,</hi> it taketh up all the east of <hi>Italy,</hi> one thousand four hundred sixty eight miles; it hath anciently been called the Kingdome of both the <hi>Sicilies.</hi> The fertilest place of all <hi>Italy,</hi> abounding in all things neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for life, delight, and physick. Hence are also brought the Neapolitan Horses. It hath had thirteen Princes, twenty four Dukes, twenty five Marquesses, ninety Earls, and nine hundred Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, not Titular only, but men of great Estates; It hath had twenty six Kings of several Countries, beginning first with the Norman race, and now being in the hand of <hi>Spain.</hi> The disease called now the French Pox, was first in all Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome found here. The Arms of this Kingdome are <hi>Azure seme</hi> of <hi>Fleur de Lices,</hi> Or, a file of three <hi>Labels Gules.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Its revenue is two millions and an half of Crowns, whereof twenty thousand are the Popes
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:38272:12"/>
for his chief rent, and the rest so exhausted in maintaining Garrisons upon the Natives, and a strong Navy against the Turks, that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> receiveth not a fourth part the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>This Crown and Kingdom hath been in long dispute between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain.

The Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> of the Family of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> now pretends a right to it, and hath attempted the Conquest of it, of late years twice, being called in by the Citizens of <hi>Naples</hi> in 1647. after that famous insurrection in the City of <hi>Naples,</hi> under <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>The People are Ingenious, Eloquent, and Pleasant, but withall very inconstant and full of talke; they Invented <hi>Oratory, Pastorall Eclogues,</hi> Hour-glasses, with Military Engins. The Soyl is incredibly fruitfull in Wine, Oyl, Honey, Minerals of Gold, Silver, and Allum; together with plenty of Salt, and Sugar; there are also gems of Agats, and Emeralds; it yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the also great store of the richest Silk, hath most excellent and delicious Fruits both for tast and colour; with abundance also of all sorts of Grain.

The People are small of stature, their Complexion inclining unto swarthiness, rude in Manners, very slothful and rebellious, yet given to Hunting; their Diet mean, their Apparel in Towns Gorgeous, in Villages base; their Religion Papistically formal, little Curious, their Clergy being counted the most illiterate and ignorant in that part of the World called Christendome; it is now in the hands of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> governed by a Vice-Roy, who resides at <hi>Calaris,</hi> and must of necessity be a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> under whom are two Deputies-Governours, <hi>Spaniards</hi> also; inferiour

being large, but not populous, so that there never came from thence, sixty thousand Men. It was reported that many Women in Mens clothes sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed their places, and fought like <hi>Amazons.</hi> The beginning of this upstart greatness, was from <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Sunderman,</hi> who being Uncle to <hi>Sigismond,</hi> King of <hi>Sweden</hi> by Descent, and of <hi>Poland</hi> by Election, upon his seating him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in that Kingdom, and constituting his Uncle Vice-Roy of his Native Kingdome of <hi>Sweden;</hi> he, with the consent of the Senators, assumes the Crown, and maintaines it against his Nephew; whereupon ensued divers Battels, the Usurper wafting over his <hi>Swedes</hi> into <hi>Poland,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning an offensive War: when he dying, his Son, the Great <hi>Gustavus,</hi> prosecuted it afresh, till after various Successes a Truce was concluded on; before the expiration of which, he fell with that strange success into <hi>Germany</hi> before said. After his death, his Daughter <hi>Christina</hi> was Crowned, and Reigned seventeen years, when another occasion of War hapning, they judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her not capable to mannage it, procured her to renounce her right to the Crown, and resign it to her kinsman <hi>Carolus Gustavus,</hi> who with a powerfull Army invaded <hi>Poland,</hi> prompted thereunto by Cardinal <hi>Mazarine,</hi> and the Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Protector of <hi>England,</hi> who by an Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor Mr. <hi>Whitlock,</hi> projected that Invasion, to keep the Arms of the House of <hi>Austria</hi> in suspence and attendance of the issue of that War, which

            <p>The people are base, ignorant, and contentious, and foolishly superstitious; after the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, they deny the proceeding of the holy Ghost, they bury their dead upright, with many other Ceremonies: <hi>Muscovia</hi> is the Seat of the Empire. The Countrey affords very good flax, and hoops to make casks, and ropes, and store of hides as well of Oxen as of Elks, much salt-fish, and whales grease; the Arms are Sable, a partel open of two leases and as many degrees, Or. Here is one Patriarch, two Arch-Bishops, eighteen Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops.</p>
            <p>The Emperour hereof is the onely Tyrant for Government, in <hi>Europe,</hi> and the people more absolute slaves than in <hi>Turkey,</hi> which makes them though perpetually in War with the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,</hi> and every other year with the <hi>Polanders,</hi> no better Souldiers; Slavery begetting in them mean and abject Spirits, so that of many years they have effected nothing considerable, save the taking in of the City and Dutchy of <hi>Smolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sko,</hi> in the year 1654. taken from them thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years before; where upon their besieging of it with an Army of an hundred thousand men, they were besieged themselves with an Army of <hi>Poles,</hi> not above ten thousand in the open fields, and were forced upon hard conditions to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der themselves; for which the <hi>Russian</hi> General nd his Son, lost their heads at their return to

               <hi>Musco,</hi> They attempted <hi>Riga</hi> also, in 1657. from the <hi>Swedes,</hi> but even as the place was by Famine and Scarcity of men ready to Capitulate, the Emperour in dispair, broke up his Siege, and departed. A peace is now concluded this year 1662. at <hi>Stockholm,</hi> by the <hi>Russian</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours sent thither in most solemn man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: But the <hi>Poles</hi> and they, are still at War with mutual success; some fifty years ago, the <hi>Pole</hi> (in behalf of <hi>Demetrius</hi> a counterfeit Emper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our) made an in-road into <hi>Russia,</hi> of above 1200. miles length, and was possest of the City of <hi>Musco,</hi> which by the valour and Conduct of one Collonel <hi>Hamilton</hi> a <hi>Scot,</hi> was rescued, and the <hi>Poles</hi> glad to depart, whose reward (of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness whereof he was so confident, as that to make himself capable thereof, he turned <hi>Russian</hi> and renounced his Religion,) was but neglect, and jealous distrust of his abilities. This Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour is likewise forced to keep a constant Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of fifty thousand men, to attend the <hi>Tartars</hi> and <hi>Cossacks</hi> bordering upon his Kingdom of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracan,</hi> who every year invade him, and make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursions some hundreds of miles, when in their return with their spoil and booty the <hi>Russian</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way-lays or overtakes him, and gives Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel. If the <hi>Russian</hi> prevail, he enters their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey and makes havock, with Fire and Sword; if not, the <hi>Tartar</hi> keeping what he has plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, is content to leave his victory and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn home. Nevertheless every year Ambassadors,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:38272:36"/>
some hundred in number, come to <hi>Musco;</hi> but their main design is, to get Presents of Silken Vests and Rayments, they look, and are sure to receive from the Emperour.</p>
            <p>The Predecessor of this Emperour shewed himself very affectionately respectful to our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign, and regardful of his Cause, when, upon the murder of his Father, he presently seized all the Estates of the <hi>English,</hi> and would have sold them, and delivered the product thereof to my Lord <hi>Wentworth,</hi> then Ambassador from His Majesty, and for his use, if he had not wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused it, telling the Emperour, They were his Masters Subjects, whom he ought rather to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect, than to spoil, for the Rebellion of other People in <hi>England:</hi> whereupon the Emperour lent a sum of Money freely himself, with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of further assistance, but would by no means grant the <hi>English</hi> their Priviledges, of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Custome-free, till His Majesties Restituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This Great Duke lives in great State and Splendor, in a most ample and Magnificent Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace and Castle at <hi>Musco</hi> City, which is now half built from <hi>Timber</hi> with <hi>Brick-Houses;</hi> the Fire, when it happened before, usually burning down a third part thereof, the flame running three or four miles in an instant. He is also very wealthy (all his Subjects riches being his own when he pleaseth) and therefore very potent.

                  <hi>Sebastian</hi> issueless, hath risen a worse Feud then that he engaged in about the Crown of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal.</hi> Some while before <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, Emper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of <hi>Germany,</hi> invading this Countrey, took the City of <hi>Tunis,</hi> and the Castle <hi>Guletto:</hi> but the <hi>Turks</hi> coming with Supplies, and the unagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness of the Climate to his <hi>Europeans,</hi> joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Witchcrafts of the <hi>Moors,</hi> for which they are infamous, made him quit his design and return home with loss. Ever since they have continued their bold Depredations and Piracies at Sea, countenanced by the Grand Seigniour, who receives therefore, or his Bashaws for him, good part of the spoil. Some kind of Traffique they use here, but among such Thievish Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions it can scarce be call'd so, though there are good Merchandises of the growth and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture of the Countrey. So that it may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be said of this place what we have in an English Proverb, <hi>Here is more Cry then Wooll,</hi> more Complaint then Commerce; the Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Slavery of People, and the Rapine of their Ships and Goods, being the common La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of all Christendom. Our late Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Blake</hi> terrified them into a better Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment with the English, by his noble and brave exploit upon <hi>Porto Ferino,</hi> where he burnt their Ships, and battered down their Stone Castles upon their Heads; but no longer pipe with the Musick of the Cannon, no longer would they dance to any agreement, though they wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly

subscribed then to those Termes. Since the putting of <hi>Tangier</hi> into <hi>English</hi> Hands, and the attempt made upon <hi>Algier,</hi> the very Den and Nest of these Thieves, by the Earl-of <hi>Sandwich,</hi> they have again bethought themselves of the terrour and danger of the <hi>English</hi> Power, and are agreed to new Terms. This <hi>Tangier</hi> is a notable Fort in the mouth of the <hi>Straits,</hi> and may serve as a Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle to their Piracies. There hath lately an Army presented it self before it, under one <hi>Guyland,</hi> and some Skirmishes have happened betwixt the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and them, but another Army coming against him, he being but a Rebel to his Prince <hi>Cidi Ali Benbucar,</hi> he drew off, and is Marched to oppose him; but what the Event will be, will neither advance nor prejudice the English Interest; though the King, now rebelled against, seemes to Court our Friendship.</p>

                  <hi>Egypt</hi> hath <hi>Idumea</hi> on the east, and the Bay of <hi>Arabia;</hi> on the west <hi>Barbary, Numidia,</hi> and part of <hi>Lybia,</hi> on the north the Mediterranean Sea, on the south <hi>Ethiopia</hi> superior, or the <hi>Abas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sin</hi> Empire. It containeth in length five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred sixty two Italian miles, and in breadth one hundred sixty; situated under the second and fifth Climates, so that their longest day in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is not above Thirteen Houres and a half. The air is very hot and offensive; the soil is fruitful, by the overflowing of <hi>Nilus;</hi> it hath rich Pastures, wherein they feed great store of Camels, Horses, Asses, Oxen, greater of growth

then usually in most places else: and by reason of the morishness of the Country, they have also great store of Fouls: it is furnished with great plenty of mettals, some precious stones, good wines, and fruits, as lemmons, oranges, pomgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, citrons, figs, cherries, and such as these, excellent both for taste and colour: here grow the Palm-trees, which alwayes grow in couples, the male and female: both thrust forth cods full of seed, but the female alwayes fruitful; and that not except growing by the male, and having his seed mixed with hers: the pith of these trees is an excellent Sallade, better then an hartichoke, which in taste it doth much resemble; of the branches they make Bedsteds, Lattices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the leaves, baskets, mats, fans, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the outward husk of the cod, cordage; of the inner, brushes: the fruit it bears, is best known by the name of Dates, which are in taste like figs: and finally it is said to yield whatsoever is necessary to the life of man: it is the nature of this tree, though never so ponderous a weight wereput upon it, never to yield to the burden, but still to resist the heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of it, and to endeavour to lift and raise it self the more upwards; a fit emblem of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection. The people are not black, but tawny or olive-coloured; they weep and mourn over the bodies of their dead, daubed over with dung: they hold it a great impiety to burn or bury them, but having embalmed them they lay them in some inner room: the men keep at home for
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:38272:54"/>
the houshold business, the Women follow merchandise and affairs abroad; the men carry burdens upon their heads, and the women upon their shoulders: a witty and ingenious people, the first Inventers of Geometry, Arithmetick, Physick, Astronomy, Necromancy, and Sorcery, yea, they found out the very use of Letters. The Christians among them differ from all other Christians; first, using circumcision with baptism. Secondly, conferring all orders under priesthood on infants immediately after baptism; their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents till they come to sixteen years of age, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming what they promised in their behalf, to wit, chastity, fasting on Wednesday and Friday, and the four Lents of the year. Thirdly, reputing baptism not to be of any efficacy except mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred by a Priest in the open Church, in what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity soever. Fourthly, and yet not baptising any children till the fortieth day, though they die in the mean time. Fifthly, giving the Lords Supper to Infants as soon as Christned. Sixthly, contracting marriages in the second degree with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out dispensation. Seventhly, not observing the Lords day, nor any Festivals, except in cities. Eighthly, reading the Gospel writ by <hi>Nicodemus.</hi> They differ from the Papists in these things: first, administring the Lords Supper in both kinds: secondly, with leavened bread: thirdly, admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting neither extreme unction nor the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to those that are sick: fourthly, nor Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory nor prayer for the dead: fifthly, nor using
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:38272:54"/>
elevation in the act of administring: and sixthly, accounting the Roman Church for heretical, and esteeming the Latines no better then the Jews.</p>
               <p>This Kingdom of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> was a long while possessed by the <hi>Mamalukes</hi> a kind of Stratocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy or Army-power, such as we had lately in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> by Red-coats and Protector; the <hi>Sultan</hi> was always elected by the souldiery, who chose always one out of themselves; the last of that Dignity was <hi>Tomombejus,</hi> who being defeated by <hi>Sultan Selymus</hi> some 260 years ago, was taken in Grand <hi>Cayro,</hi> whither he fled out of the field, and had made a brave defence by bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricading the streets, for three days; He conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued not long in a condition of Captivity, for he was hanged at his Prison Door, and exposed to the view of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> as a spectacle of the Vanity of humane greatness. By this <hi>Sely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> this Kingdom was reduced into a province, where one of the principal Bashawes keeps Court, in great state: His Government being the richest in all the <hi>Turkish</hi> Dominions, from whence yearly many ships lading of wealth is brought to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> which is alwayes way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laid by some Gallies of <hi>Malta</hi> or <hi>Florence,</hi> but of late years with little success, they come so strongly guarded; and if they fear any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, have all the Coast of <hi>Cyprus, Rhodes,</hi> and the Continent to Friend. The Bashawes are sent thither as Spunges, for when they have sucked an
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:38272:55"/>
incredible treasure by pilling, fraud, and rapine; they are sent for home and are squeezed to their skins, which sometimes they are forced to part with to boot.</p>
               <p>There hath been no change but of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours ever since the Conquest of this Kingdom, which is usual with other Bashawes, as namely those of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> who do often rebel and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the Grand Seigniour, so that at present the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians</hi> continue in the same obedience and dumb slavery to which they have been so long accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, changing in this <hi>Turkish</hi> Tyranny, the names, not the nature thereof, from that they suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered under the <hi>Mamalukes.</hi>

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:38272:55"/>
their Goats they feed with the stones, wherewith they grow fat, and yield store of Milk; the Air is so sound, that it cureth the French Pox without any Physick; the Inhabitants are base and vile People, Thieves, Murderers, Treacherous, and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of all things, feeding most on Dates, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, and Carrion, counting Bread a diet for Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidayes; their Garments of the coarsest Cloth, so short, that they cover not half the body; the richer sort wear a Jacket of blew Cotton with great Sleeves, they ride upon Camels without Stirrup or Saddle: a Leather thrust through an hole made in the nose of the Camel, serves them for a Bridle, and to save Spurs, they use a Goade; their Religion is Mahometisme.</p>

The religion of the people is, they use to circumcise their children both males and females. Secondly they baptise the males at forty, and the Females eighty dayes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Circumcision. Thirdly, after the Lords Supper they are not to spit till the Sun-set. Fourthly, they professe but one nature and one will in Christ. Fifthly, they accept only the three first generall Councils. Sixthly, their Priests live by the labour of their own hands, for they allow them nothing, nor permit them to beg. Seventhly, they baptize themselves eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Epiphany</hi> in lakes and ponds, because that day they suppose Christ to have been baptized of <hi>Iohn</hi> in <hi>Iordan.</hi> Eightly, they eat not of those beasts which in the old Law are reckoned for unclean. Ninthly, and they keep the Jews Sabbath equally solemn with the Lords day Tenthly, they minister the Lords Supper to Infants pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently after baptisme. Eleventhly, they teach the reasonable soul of man is derived from the parents by seminal propagation. Twelfthly, that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sants dying unbaptized, are sanctified in the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:38272:56"/>
womb by vertue of the Lords Supper received by the mother after her conception. And final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they shew a Book of eight volumes, writ as they say, by the Apostles assembled at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> for that purpose; the contents thereof they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve most solemnly, and they differ from the Papists as the Christians in <hi>Egypt:</hi> they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Government of <hi>Prester Iohn</hi> and the Turk.</p>
               <p>I pass by <hi>Ethiopia inferior,</hi> the people being Pagans where we may observe the distinguishing goodness and grace of God, who by people under the same climate and Region is known and unknown; a peculiar Kingdom, surrounded e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where with Pagans and Mahometans, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping the living God, and believing in Christ though erring in many circumstantials of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Doctrine, imputable chiefly to remedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse Tradition.

Since which fortunate adventures, the course of the World and Governments have been altered, for Empire hath followed Arts, to wit, the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of those Treasures and Mines which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:38272:60"/>
Nature had so long obscured, and hidden from these parts of the World; For, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> being possest of these Mines, as we shall see presently, a wonder it is how formidable he grew, and to what greatness he arose, even to the aspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ambition of an Universal Monarchy; dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining to be numbered the Fifth (the other Four being indeed but partly so) whereas this aimed to be one and all: and <hi>Thomas de Campa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nella,</hi> a Learned <hi>Iesuit,</hi> hath written a very elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Tract, shewing the means and feisible wayes thereunto.</p>
               <p>The first Discoverer of this Fourth part of the World, was <hi>Christopher Columbus,</hi> a <hi>Genoese;</hi> who, having studied Geometry, and been bred at Sea, had more then strong imaginations, that there were great and vast Regions to the West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of <hi>Europe;</hi> and thereupon communicated the Project to several Merchants: who, unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, or unable to hazard so much Money as was requisite to such an undertaking, advised him to address himself to some Prince, whose Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions were accommodated to the Design, if it did succeed; by whom he might be set forth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Voyage: which he so importunately pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted, as it is natural with all Men, who fancy to themselves a single and sure way to Honour and Profit. VVhereupon he addressed himself first to our King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, and laid open to him and his Council the fair possibilities of the Design, and the advantages which would
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:38272:61"/>
thence accrue to this Crown, being so conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently scituated for that Navigation: King <hi>Henry</hi> heard him, but gave little credit to his Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, affecting a secure Exchequer, which he had unknown wayes (before) to fill, beyond the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain hopes of unknown Mines, which, like the Philosophers Stone might have no other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence than in projection. He then made offer of this his service to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of <hi>Arragon</hi> and <hi>Castile,</hi> a wise and prudent Prince; who publickly weighing the small charge against the exceeding Honour and Gain, consented to His desires, and furnished him with fifteen Ships, Men, and Victuals for the Vovage, giving him Commission and Authority in his name, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue the adventure.</p>

The next were those in 1485 that came with Sir <hi>Richard Greenvile</hi> from <hi>Plimonth</hi> with seven sail, who

in a Months time came to St. <hi>Domingo</hi> in <hi>Hispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niola;</hi> and within a fortnight after, anchored at <hi>Florida;</hi> and in 1586. Sir <hi>Richard Greenvile</hi> came again, but the Colony he had left were all killed: so he returned, and sent Mr. <hi>White,</hi> who made a successeful Voyage, and was Governour there; who, returning into <hi>England,</hi> and leaving another Colony, they were all destroyed at his coming again: which so dis-heartned all further under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, that it was twelve years before another Voyage was begun, under Captain <hi>Gosnol,</hi> in the year 1602. who, passing by the <hi>Azores,</hi> made the Voyage shorter by 500.

The extreme cold of the Winter is, half <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Ianuary, February,</hi> and half <hi>March.</hi> The Winds are variable, but no such Thunder or Lightning as in <hi>Europe:</hi> all the varieties of needful Fruits which we have here, may, by the industry of men, be in great plenty there.</p>
               <p>There is but one entrance by Sea into this Country, and that is at the Mouth of a very goodly Bay, eighteen or twenty miles broad: The South <hi>Cape</hi> is called <hi>Cape Henry:</hi> and the North, <hi>Cape Charles,</hi> in honour of those two Princes. The Land may have the prerogative over most places known, for large and pleasant Navigable Rivers, Mountains, Hills, Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys, and Champion Fields. In the Bay which lieth North and South, are many Isles, both great and small: the water floweth herein neer 200. miles, and hath a Channel for 140. miles, of betwixt 6, and 15 Fathom deep, being in breadth some 10 or 14 miles. The Mountains are of divers natures: for, at the Head of the Bay, the Rocks are of a Composition, like Mill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stones, some of Marble, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Colour of the Earth did in some places resemble <hi>Bole Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niac, Tirra Sigillata,</hi> Fullers Earth: but gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally it is a black Sandy Mould: In some pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces again fat slimy Clay, in others a very barren Gravel: The whole Country is neither Mountainous nor yet low, but bestowed into pleasant Hills, and fertile Valleys, one prettily crossing another, and watered conveniently with
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:38272:63"/>
fresh Brooks and Streams, no less commodions then delightful. There is little Grass, for all the Country is over-grown with Trees, whose continual Droppings causeth their Grass to turn to Weeds, by reason of the ranckness of the Ground, which is now well amended by the Plantations. The Wood is commonly Oake, and Walnut; many of their Oakes so tall and streight that they will bear two foot and an half square of good Timber for twenty yards long: there is also some Ash and Elm, Mulberries, Chesnuts which taste like Damsons; and Vines, but they are wild and bear few Grapes. There are also Gums, Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dars, Saxafras-Trees, Berries, Herbs and Roots, Pellitory and Oranges.</p>
               <p>For Beasts, there are Deer, Squirrells, Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, Otters, Foxes, Dogs, Martins, Pole-cats, and Weasels. For Birds, there are all sorts of Hawks, Partridges, Turkeys, Blackbirds, Thru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes, and divers of our small Birds. In Winter there are great plenty of Swans, Geese, and such Wilde Foul; as also Parrots and Pigeons. For Fish, there is Sturgeon, Grampus, Porcupisce, Seal, Mullets, white Salmons, Trouts, Soales, Plaise, Herrings, Pearch, Crabs, Stromps, Eeles, Lampreys, Oysters, Cockles and Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</p>
               <p>The Inhabitants differ much in stature, but generally they are tall and streight, they are of colour Brown; or enclining to an Olive when at Age, but are born white. They are incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant

in every thing but what fear constraineth them to keep, Crafty, Timorous, quick of apprehension, and very ingenious. They are soon moved to anger; and so malicious, that they seldome forget an Injury. Their Buildings and Habitations are for the most part by Rivers, or not far distant from some fresh Spring; their Houses are built like our Arbours of small young Twigs, bowed and tyed; and so close-covered with Mats, or the Barks of Trees, very handsom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that notwithstanding either Wind, Rain, or Weather, they are as warm as Stoves, but very smoky, yet at the top of the House they have a Hole to let it out. The Men use Fishing, Hunting, and other Manly Exercises; while the Women sow and reap, and carry burdens, and do all the Drudgery.</p>
               <p>Their Chief God they serve is the Devil, whom they call <hi>Okee,</hi> more out of fear then love. In their Temples, which are Houses 60. foot high, built Arbour-wise, are placed the Images of their Devils and Kings, and their Tombes. They have a Chief, and Inferiour Priests, but keep no Day more Holy then another. They use also di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Conjurations, and have Altars, but they stand from their Temples. In some parts of their Country they have yearly a Sacrifice of Children: Upon some conference with them concerning their Religion, although they could not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded to forsake their False Gods, yet they did believe, that our God as much exceeded theirs,

               <p>Many encounters the English had with these Natives, who, by treacheries and open assaults endeavoured to disturb their possession: but they were so frighted with the noise, and so terrified with the Execution of the Guns, that they were kept in some awe, while <hi>Iames</hi> Town was finished which by the constant supplies sent yearly by the Council for <hi>Virginia,</hi> was at last well built and fortified and pallisadoed, and the Salvages awed into a good Comportment, untill the comming of the Lord <hi>de La Ware,</hi> just as through want the <hi>English</hi> were resolved to qui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>English</hi> Collony fell to planting their Corn, about <hi>April</hi> every year; every man having been allotted three Acres of Ground, in the nature of Farms (the first Farmer there being one <hi>William Spence)</hi> who were to supply their stores for it, with a small quantity of Corn yearly, by which means it was wonderfull to see how in so short a time this Colony was thriven in its repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>

A Convention also in the nature of a Parliament was called, and several gifts to charitable uses for bringing up the <hi>Indian</hi> Children, transmitted to the Governour and Council, so that they were by the year 1620 in a very flourishing condition, that year arriving no less than eleven ships, and 1216 persons, which were thus to be disposed, 80. for Tennants to the Governors Lands, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider 50. sent the former Spring for the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies Land, and 150. for the Colledge, 100. for the Glebe-land, 90. young Women to make Wives, 50.

The year before the Lord <hi>De la Ware</hi> had mainly promoted this good and great Work, passing over thither, though he had hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly escaped before, dyed, to the great grief and discouragement of the Plantation; most of the Nobility entred now also into the undertaking, and were Treasurers for it to the further promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of these good beginnings, by whose Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions order was taken for suppressing the Plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Tobacco, Planting of Corn: but all to little effect, the stream of the Inclination of the Planters, or good nature of the Soyl to cherish that Plant, preferring it before all Grain what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, to the incredible profit of that Colony, as it afterwards proved. Now also there was much suit for Patents for Plantations; and several Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons transported themselves upon their own Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts, bu, twe shall see, met with a miserable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment.</p>
               <p>For, on the 22 of <hi>March</hi> 1622. these perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Infidels, though they had promised to hold the League inviolable, till the Sky should fall, as they termed it, resolved upon a General Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacre; which, by reason of the English separating themselves, for the better Soyl, and commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of Ground, no way in the least distru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting these Miscreants (whom, in hope of their Conversion, they had used with all Familiarity and Civility imaginable, and therefore every way unprovided of defence, their Guns never used

The next ship that was cast away, (or indeed rather to be said saved) was that of Sir <hi>George Summers,</hi> designed in 1609 for <hi>Virginia,</hi> which by a Hurricane being covered with water, and so leaking, that after three days the men gave over working, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting themselves to Gods mercy, unexpected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as Sir <hi>George</hi> was sitting at the Steerage, gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the ship to keep her upright, came within sight of Land, to which they made, and ran her so even between two Rocks that she poised her self, where he unladed the goods, the storm ceasing, and came on shore, where finding such unhoped for plenteous refreshments, (though he went to <hi>Virginia</hi> in a Cedar-ship, in which he returned thither again and there died) two of his men which staid afterwards behind two years, and one he left, when he was carried home dead, when as they were contriving their departure and
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:38272:67"/>
committing themselves to the Sea in a little Bark, a Ship appeared and stayed their resolutions.</p>
                  <p>During their abode here, they found in one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Lump among the crevises of the Rocks a piece of <hi>Ambergreece,</hi> the greatest yet found, weighing 80 <hi>l.</hi> with other small crumbles,</p>
                  <p>This with much adoe was secured for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of these Sumer-Islands, who to the number of one hundred and twenty, had purchased a Patent for the said Isle, whom the News of the <hi>Amber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greece</hi> much augmented. The first Governour was Mr. <hi>More,</hi> he departing, there was a monthly succession of six, till one should come from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which was Captain <hi>Daniel Tucker:</hi> in the mean time the Fortifications were finished and the Isle secured from any attempt of the <hi>Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iard,</hi> in whose time happened that memorable Voyage of five Persons, <hi>Viz. Richard Sanders, William Godwin</hi> a Ship-Carpenter, <hi>Thomas Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison</hi> a Joyner, <hi>Iames Barker</hi> a Gentleman, and <hi>Henry Puet;</hi> who making a Boat under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for Fishing, being hardly used and not suffered to depart in the Ships, by the assistance of a Compass, unknown to any person till they were gone, set to Sea having provided themselves of Victuals, and by a direct Course, the wind favouring them, in five weeks time (though a Pyrat to whom they sailed hoping to be taken in, took away from them their Compass and other necessary implements) arrived in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where the Earl of <hi>Thomond</hi> honourably received

The Coasts of the Sea is near one hundred and thirty leagues of length. In this Land are veins of Gold, of more than two and twenty Caracts and a half. It is plentiful of Wheat and other Seeds, for there are two Harvests in a year.

                  <p>The Provinces of <hi>Plate,</hi> take name from the River on which they lie: the passage to them is up the said River, but they are almost on the back of <hi>Brazil.</hi> They are large and far wholsomer than <hi>Brazil,</hi> plenty of Sugar, Ginger, Wine, Wheat, Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, all sorts of <hi>English</hi> Fruits, store of Cattel, Swine, and Horses, but no mines that are work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. They are subjected by the Spaniards, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited to the Council of <hi>Peru,</hi> on the South Sea, for nearness of lying to that Kingdome, there is a common passage from these Provinces thither by land over the Mountains; the most of the Land is indifferently inhabited.</p>

The Country men are strong and valiant beyond compare, which the Spaniards know to their great cost: for they could never totally subdue this Nation.</p>
                  <p>The bounds of this Council of <hi>Charcas</hi> stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from <hi>Chilia</hi> to <hi>Peru:</hi> It hath abundance of Cattel of all kinds, great shag-haired Sheep bigger than Goats, that carry great burthens on their backs; store of Corn of all sorts, Fruits and Wine, much Gold and the greatest Mines of Silver in the World. There are few Spanish Towns, and but one but Port, in regard the Spaniards get neat the Hill of <hi>Potosi,</hi> to the City <hi>Imperial,</hi> which lyeth in nineteen degrees of latitude far from the Sea, and delivereth that which is exported, and receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Merchandize imported at the City of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca.</hi>

This Kingdom is well peopled with civil orderly <hi>Indians,</hi> that are in great subjection to the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards.

                  <p>The temperature of Air, is very different in this place, for here are some places indifferent temperate and cool, other places are very hot and sickly.

                  <p>This Straight is famous for the troublesome passage of <hi>Drake, Candish,</hi> and <hi>Haukins,</hi> three English men Generals, each in a several Fleet: <hi>Drake</hi> and <hi>Candish</hi> being the first that sailed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the coast of <hi>Peru,</hi> and so to the <hi>East In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> and came home by the cape of <hi>Bona Speran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za,</hi> circum-navigating the Globe.

                  <p>The entrance into this Straight is in 52 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and the coming out into the south sea the same height.</p>
                  <p>It is an extreme difficult passage by reason of the meeting of the north and south seas in the channell, driving each other back, prevailing as they are favoured by the wind, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly bloweth there exceeding boisterously and
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:38272:83"/>
cold. There are divers Caves and Bayes in it, but no encouragement for a Seaman to adventure that way. The Inhabitants on this Straight are few, and extreme savage, neither is this passage any more in use: for those that will go by the south of <hi>America</hi> to the <hi>East Indies,</hi> or into the south sea, to any part of the west coast of <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi> have a more convenient passage south of this Straight in an open sea.

sailing towards the North, about on thousand six hundred forty, further than <hi>Guinny,</hi> discovered divers Lands, and passing on the South-side, sail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about the East coast of New <hi>Guinny,</hi> and so go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on Westward he came to the <hi>Indies;</hi> whence we may certainly gather, that all the former de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions and definitions of the Magellanick and unknown Lands are but mean abuses and certain devised Fables.</p>
                  <p>These Lands and Countries being subdued in the space of 60 years, with much blood and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, were settled as his Dominions in the year 1550, from which time they have continued with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any remarkable alteration, setting aside some private inroads of the <hi>English, Dutch,</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> till the business of <hi>Iamaica,</hi> which now threatens some danger to the vast and potent body of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Empire.</p>
