            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>The Lord marshals coulors eke, </l>
               <l>was carried there all rent and torne.</l>
               <l>The which with bullets was so burned, </l>
               <l>when in Flaunders he soiourned.</l>
               <l>Thus in warlike wise they martched </l>
               <l>euen as soft as foote could fall:</l>
               <l>Because her Grace was fully minded, </l>

               <l>vnto the hill with perfect sight:</l>
               <l>The ground all couered she espyes, </l>
               <l>with feet of armed souldiers bright.</l>
               <l>Whereat her royall hart so leaped, </l>
               <l>on her féet vpright she stepped.</l>

               <l>The king of Heralds tall and comely, </l>

               <l>Most comely men for to behold, </l>
               <l>in veluet coates and chaines beside.</l>
               <l>The Lord generall then came riding, </l>
               <l>and Lord marshall hard beside him.</l>
               <l>Richly were they both atired, </l>

            </lg>
            <lg>

               <l>With pearles and diamonds braue adorned, </l>
               <l>and in costly cales of gold:</l>
               <l>Her Guarde in scarlet then rid after, </l>
               <l>with bowes and arrowes stoute and bold.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The valiant Captaines of the field, </l>
               <l>meane space them selues in order set:</l>
               <l>And each of them with speare and shéelde, </l>
               <l>to ioyne in battaile did not let.</l>
               <l>With such a warlike skill extended, </l>
               <l>as the same was much commended.</l>
               <l>Such a battaile pitcht in England, </l>
               <l>many a day hath not béene séene:</l>
               <l>Thus they stood in order waiting, </l>
               <l>for the presence of our Quéene.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>At length her grace most royally, </l>
               <l>receiued was and brought againe:</l>
               <l>Where she might sée most loyally, </l>
               <l>this noble hoast and warlike traine.</l>
               <l>How they cam martching all together, </l>
               <l>like a wood in winters weather.</l>
               <l>With the strokes of drummers sounding, </l>
               <l>and with trampling horses than:</l>
               <l>The earth and aire did sound like thunder, </l>
               <l>to the eares of euerie man.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The warlike Armie then stood still, </l>
               <l>and drummers left their dubbing sound:</l>
               <l>Because it was our Princes will, </l>
               <l>to ride about the Armie round.</l>
               <l>Her Ladies she did leaue behind her,</l>
               <l> and her Guarde which still did minde her.</l>
               <l>The Lord generall and Lord marshall, </l>
               <l>did conduct her to each place:</l>
               <l>The pikes, the colours, and the lances, </l>
               <l>at her approch fell downe apace.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And then bespake our noble Queene,</l>
               <l> my louing friends and countriemen:</l>
               <l>I hope this day the worst is seene, </l>
               <l>that in our wars ye shall sustaine.</l>
               <l>But if our enimies doe assaile you, </l>
               <l>neuer let your stomackes faile you.</l>
               <l>For in the midst of all your troupe, </l>

               <l>euen before our enimies face.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>This done the souldiers all at once, </l>
               <l>a mightie shoute or crye did giue:</l>
               <l>Which forced from the Assure skyes, </l>
               <l>an Ecco loud from thence to driue.</l>
               <l>Which fild her grace with ioy and pleasure, </l>
               <l>and riding then from them by leasure.</l>
               <l>With trumpets sound most loyally,</l>
               <l> a long the Court of guarde she went:</l>
               <l>Who did conduct her Maiestie, </l>
               <l>vnto the Lord chiefe generals tent.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Where she was feasted royally, </l>
               <l>with dainties of most costly price:</l>
               <l>And when that night aproched nye,</l>
               <l> her Maiestie with sage aduice.</l>
               <l>In gracious manner then returned, </l>
               <l>from the Campe where she soiourned.</l>
               <l>And when that she was safely set,</l>
               <l> within her Barge, and past away:</l>
               <l>Her farewell then the trumpets sounded, </l>
               <l>and the cannons fast did play,</l>
