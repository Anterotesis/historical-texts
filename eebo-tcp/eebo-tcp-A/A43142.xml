         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>However, I ſhall endeavour to give you an exact account of theſe Caterpillars, with their hidden and myſterious way of ſpeaking, which they make uſe of to blind the eyes of thoſe they have cheated or robb'd, and inform one another with what they have done, or deſigne to do. There is no profeſt Rogue whatever, (if he be qualified for his thiev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faculty) but muſt be well vers'd in Canting: and to the intent that they may not fall ſhort of being excellent proficients in all manner of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guery, they lay the ground work thereof in Cant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for by this they are able to converſe with, and underſtand thoſe of the upper Form of Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and by conſtant frequenting their company, become acquainted with Canting words which are moſt new, and what are thrown aſide as too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly known, the uſe whereof if not timely left off, may be the Inſtruments which may unhappily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray them to their condign puniſhments.</p>
                  <p>The principal Profeſſors of this Gibberiſh or Canting, I find, are a ſort of People which are vulgarly called <hi>Gypſies;</hi> and they do endeavour to perſwade the ignorant, that they were extracted from the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> a people heretofore very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for Aſtronomy, Natural Magick, the Art of Divination, with many other occult Arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences; and theſe Strolers (that they may ſeem to have their derivation from theſe ancient black Magi) are great pretenders to Fortune-telling, and to colour their impoſtures, they artificially diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour their faces, and with this tawny hew and tat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdemallion habit, they rove up and down the Country, and with the pretenſion of wonderful prediction, delude a many of the younger and leſs intelligent people.</p>
                  <p>And that they may not prejudice their Society
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57215:6"/>any ways by fooliſh babling, betraying the helliſh ſecrets of the fraternity, they ſwear all that are admitted into their Fellowſhip: for did they not take that courſe, they could not be ſafe among themſelves from homebred treachery.

                  <p>However they have a Form of an Oath, with Articles annexed thereunto, which though it binds but ſlightly, yet they keep it for the moſt part in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violably, which every one muſt take before he is admitted into this ragged ſociety, adminiſtred by the principal Maunder, or Roguing Stroler.</p>

Sir, ſaid one, which ſeem'd to be the luſtieſt and moſt confident fellow of the whole Company, we come from a far cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try (ſpeaking in a ſtrange tone, and ſtranger Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh) and are the true children of the Wiſe men of the Eaſt, we are skil'd in the dark and ſecret my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries

Whilſt he was buſying himſelf in telling me my fortunes, I with much earneſtneſs obſerved his countenance, which methoughts I knew, notwithſtanding its tawny dye; I view'd it again and again, and by often comparing the preſent lineaments of his face, with thoſe my memory had formerly retained of him, I grew confident this man muſt be one of my former acquaintance. Having throughly view'd my hand, and ſeemingly taking ſome information from my face, he began to tell me ſome truths that I knew to be ſo, (for like a cunning Rogue he had not forgot me) though he would not take the leaſt notice of me; and that I might not ſuſpect him, he preſently roved from the diſcourſe of what he experimentally knew of me, and talk'd at random of I know not what; Having finiſhed his predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, inſtead of giving him a reward, I deſired that I might ſee his hand, and in requital of the pains he had taken to tell me my fortune, I told him, I would tell him his; With ſome unwillingneſs he gave me his hand, and looking into it, after ſome pauſe, I ſpake after this manner: <hi>Sir, I can but reverence and admire you for your great skill, and muſt reſpect your perſon, in ſpight of the meaneſs of your apparel.

                     <p>Hereupon I clapt ſpurrs to my Horſe, but could not ſtir one foot, for this ſturdy Rogue had faſt hold of my bridle Reins.

                     <p>Without much ceremony in taking leave of one the other, on I rid to the place appointed for our meeting, it being not many miles diſtant from the place where I met with this ragged crue of Tatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demallions, I got in four hours before Sunſet: I might have been there ſooner had it not been for
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57215:9"/>the obſcurity of the place on which this ſtately Maunding Manſion, this Begging Dormitory ſtood, which I found out more by the deſcription my Captain Gypſie gave me of it, than any other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation I met with by the way.</p>
                     <p>Arriving at the houſe, with what tokens I brought with me, my reception was as kind as they could make it; and preparations were inſtantly made, not onely for my ſake, but for the welcome of the Strolers they expected.</p>
                     <p>The houſe was not very ſplendid you may ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, yet large enough to contain three times tha Company. Whilſt I was penſively ſitting, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on what I had ſeen, and ſtudying how I might divert my ſelf till their coming, my Hoſts daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter brought me ſome Ale, of which I had no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er taſted, but I was forced to commend the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it.</p>
                     <p>She was homely, yet cleanly clad, and very tall. The Father and Mother, what with age and arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial means they heretofore uſed to diſcolour their faces, look'd like the twins of a lecherous He-De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, begotten on an overgrown age-ridden Lapland Witch; for it ſeems this pair of Houſe-keepers had formerly uſed the trade of ſtroling and telling fortunes, but growing old and unable to travel, had by the aſſiſtance of the Brotherhood, erected this Fabrick for their reception.</p>
                     <p>The goodneſs of the Ale made me drink freely of it, and the liberty I took to indulge my appetite, made me as freely talk. This perſwaded my Hoſt and Hoſteſs that they might take ſome freedom to, nor was the daughter therein a jot behind us; I might now properly ſay, we were as merry as ſo many Beggars: and that I might not want Muſick to increaſe my mirth, the Father, Mother, and

                     <p>I drank to ſo high a pitch, that I was forced to forſake my Company and betake my ſelf to ſleep, truſting them to do with me as they pleaſed, but awaking after two hours, and conſidering how fooliſhly I had done, I examined my pockets but found nothing miſſing, then turning my ſelf about, there lay my untouch'd Bed-fellow, the Hoſts daughter by my ſide, who tired with expectation was fallen aſleep, it was unkindly done of me to ſlight the preſent my loving Landlady had ſent me, and I could not but be troubled at the diſſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction I read in the eyes and face of the poor fool'd and cheated Girl.</p>

                     <p>I liv'd after this manner for a Month, and began to be much in love with my begging Profeſſion, and had continued it had I not accidentally fallen into the acquaintance of a notable lazy companion like my ſelf, whom I found ſunning himſelf in <hi>Lincolnſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in</hi>-fields. With little difficulty and leſs time we became intimately acquainted, and thereupon ſworn brothers. We beg'd together, lay together and louz'd together, and were inſeparable; it was he that taught me firſt to ſteal, and by his means firſt ſoundly whipt. For it was our cuſtome in the cloſe of the Evening, to beg at doors, which if we found open, we boldly enter'd, and if we eſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed none in the way, what was next at hand we rub'd off with; if we ſaw any, we ſtraightwaies applyed our ſelves to our whining notes and pitiful looks, begging for Gods ſake to beſtow their charity on two Orphan Twins, who were both troubled with the Falling-ſickneſs: ſome were ſo pittiful and credulous as to give their Alms, but the moſt (ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us ſturdy and luſty young Lads) fright'ned us away with the threats of the whiping Poſt, but theſe menaces did not ſcare us from our continual filch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing notwithſtanding. But the Pitcher goes not ſo often to the Well but that it comes home broken at laſt. For one night watching at a door for an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, ſeeing the coaſt clear I whipt up ſtairs, and happily the firſt thing my hands faſtned on, was a Hair-Chamlet Cloak; overjoy'd with the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the prize and minding not the diſtance of the ſtairs from me, I came ſooner to the Stair head than I was aware of, and fell to the bottom of the ſtairs, making a noiſe like a Devil in a Drum: this unexpected misfortune did put my experienc'd Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and Comrade to the run, and with all ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm'd the houſe, that there was no hole left for me to creep out at.</p>

                     <p>Search being made, I was found with my Cloak lying at the ſtair foot, not able to ſtir; but my mercileſs foes did ſoon put life in me by by boxing and kicking me one to another; they had done me a kindneſs had they kick'd me out into the ſtreet; but hold there, after all this miſ-uſage I was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried before a Juſtice, who preſently ſent me to <hi>Newgate.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Seſſions, as good luck would have it, was at hand, otherwiſe, I know not how I ſhould have lived a fortnight with a penny a day in Bread and Water: Being brought to the old <hi>Baily,</hi> I had my Tryal, and received ſentence of ſevere whipping, which was accordingly performed, and return'd to <hi>Newgate</hi> to lie there till I had paid my fees; which was ſo long (having no friend to help me) that I there became intimately acquainted with the whole Gang of ROGUES, diſtinguiſhed by Files, Lifts, Gilts, Budges, Runners, Heavers, &amp;c. Who ſeeing how forward I was to be one of them, promiſed me, if ever we met abroad, they would inſtruct me in a trade ſhould bring me in a lively<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, which I found would have put me out of one, had I longer followed their inſtructions.</p>
                     <p>I now deſpair'd of coming out, and whilſt I thought ſo, my little Tutor ſent a youngſter to me (for he durſt not come himſelf, being too well known by the Keepers) who brought me more Money than would diſcharge my Fees, with dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions where I ſhould find him.</p>
                     <p>I inſtantly addreſt my ſelf to the Maſter-Keeper, telling him that I had a friend had ſent me ſome money and therefore I deſired to know what I was indebted and I would pay it, provided I might be diſcharged; he readily told me, and now we were poſſeſt with one and the ſame joy, that he
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57215:19"/>was freed from me, and I from him.</p>
                     <p>I was no ſooner out, but I fell a running, as if I intended to run out of my wits, and never ſtopt till I came to my Comrade: you may imagine there was no ſmall joy at meeting, and to waſh down ſorrow, we concluded to booz it rumly.</p>
                     <p>Over our Ale he recounted me all his adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſince my ſurprizal, and how ſucceſsful he was in them all; then taking me by the hand, ſaid, come boy ne'r be diſheartned for one ill bargain I'l put thee in a way which ſhall recompence thy whipping.</p>
                     <p>Night approaching we did ſeveral exploits and came off well, the next day and night we continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with the like ſucceſs, and now we had got Money enough to new cloath our ſelves, which we did, having firſt unhusk'd.</p>
                     <p>What I had promiſed me in <hi>New-gate,</hi> I had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd abroad, for meeting with one of my fellow Collegiats, he was over-joy'd to ſee me, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at ſuch a time when he could ſerve me; for, ſaid he, I am now going to meet with ſome accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to appointment, <hi>who will make <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s All,</hi> he might have added, <hi>Be Hanged.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Taking my Comrade I went with him, where we found a jolly company drinking after a ſtrange rate to their good ſucceſs that night; in a little time I underſtood their meaning; for, ſaid one, let us ceaſe from this exceſſive drinking, you know what a weighty buſineſs we are to go about, no leſs than fifteen hundred pound in ready Mony, beſides Plate and Jewells: hereupon they were adviſed, and fell immediately to plotting and rightly contriving the buſineſs.</p>
                     <p>It was agreed upon, that I and my Comrade ſhould be the <hi>Forelorne-hope,</hi> or more properly the

                     <p>At firſt I knew not what to make of it, judging it ſo hazardous, that I trembled when I did but think thereon; my Comrade perceiving how ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous I was, ſhook me by the hand, bidding me be of good courage, he would warrant all well. Hereupon I reſolv'd on the exploit and away we went together.</p>
                     <p>A little before night my Comrade had lodg'd himſelf, but I knew not where, and being loath to be behind hand with him, I got underneath the ſtairs in a hole deſcending into the Collar, ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, as if it had been made for my purpoſe. There was a Clock in the houſe, which I watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully told and obſerved, and when it ſtruck twelve (which was the fatal hour appointed) out I got and met full-but with my Comrade, who was as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent as my ſelf to let them in, they being ready without, enter'd and leaving us two Sentinels at Door, they mounted the Stairs, and in a trice had ſecured all that were in the houſe by Gagging and binding them; juſt as they were within ken of their booty; the Gentleman of the houſe (who had been at play and had quarrell'd with ſome Gentlemen,) came home attended by ſeveral Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, and guarded with a Conſtable and ſtrong watch, but wondred to ſee two young Sentinels at his door; as ſoon as we ſaw him we betook our ſelves to our heels, having no time left to acquaint the reſt with the preſent danger; the Conſtable ſeeing us run, let looſe a couple of his Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hounds, and ſtay'd our farther progreſs; in the mean time the Gentleman enter'd his houſe; they
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57215:20"/>within finding themſelves diſcovered, drew, and attempted to cut their paſſage through; but the Conſtable hearing a great noiſe with claſhing of ſwords, ſecuring me and my comrade, preſently ran to their aſſiſtance; and to be ſhort ſecured them all, with whom we were ſent to bear them Company in the Counter that night: in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing being carried before the Juſtice, there was mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of fact, and proof enough to ſend us to <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate;</hi> being tryed at Seſſions, we were all found guilty of Burglary and accordingly received ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Death, which was executed accordingly, onely I and my Comrade being very young, had the benefit of Tranſportation.</p>
                     <p>Seven years in our exile, we did what our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters commanded us and our time being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, we reſolv'd to return for <hi>England,</hi> but death put an end to my Comrades Voyage, however I alter'd not my reſolution, but ſail'd for <hi>England,</hi> where in ſeveral places I made trials to live honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but could not, <hi>For what is bred in the bone will never out of the fleſh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now knowing that if ever I was taken again on any Fellonious account, I ſhould aſſuredly be hang'd; and being ſo lazy that I hated the thought of working, I reſolved to follow the life of a ſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>Gypſie,</hi> into which Society I was joyfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: I grew ſo good a proficient in the myſteries of this trade, that with a joint conſent I was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen at a ſolemn meeting, their Prince or King; and for theſe reaſons; Firſt, becauſe I was young and well proportion'd; Secondly, becauſe I was luſtier and ſtronger than the reſt; And Laſtly, becauſe I had more than common learning, and more wit than they had, put them altogether.</p>
                     <p>Now the reaſons inducing me to follow this life,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57215:21"/>were theſe; Firſt, a lazy diſpoſition; Secondly, a lecherous inclination; And Laſtly, profit. As to the firſt, we do nothing for a livelyhood but walk up and down in Summer time, which is rather a paſtime than pain; and in Winter, retire to ſuch quarters as are ſuitable to the ſeaſon, not ſtirring thence till ſpring. As to the ſecond, our females are all in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon among us, and though their skins be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour'd, they have as good fleſh as can be coveted by an youthful appetite. And laſtly, as to profit; It is incredible to think how much we get by For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune-telling, among the ignorant, the poor wen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches being ready to pawn their Petticoats to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure us money, to tell them how fruitful they ſhall be, when Married; or whether <hi>William</hi> or <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> loveth them or not: But the greateſt profit we reap is from our By-blows, theſe Children our Morts carry at their backs are all of them Baſtards, and moſt of them none of their own begetting; for when young Gentlewomen have trod awry, and the Fathers are not to be diſgraced, the Bantlings for a good round ſum are ſent to us to be nurſed, where they are never like to come to the knowledge of their true Parents. Here he made an end, if you ſhall approve of what is already written, I wil ſhortly inlarge my ſelf on this ſubject.</p>

                        <p>From theſe I underſtood, that the Mode of Canting alter'd very often, and that they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to change frequently thoſe material words which chiefly diſcovered their myſterious practices and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57215:33"/>Villanies, leaſt growing too common their own words ſhould betray them.</p>

If I ſeem deficient in the quantity of words, let ſome elſe ſupply my defects, having collected words ſufficiently enough for one, if you will have more, take the pains which I have done to be ſupplyed, and in the mean time be content with what is gathered to your hands.</p>

                     <p>A Crew of Gypſies continuing for ſome time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout one Town in <hi>Gloceſterſhire,</hi> but divided in the day, though united in the night, all congregated to one appointed place, which was a convenient Barn for their purpoſe, about an half mile from this Town: Hither they reſorted night after night, and in the morning ſtill early got up and ſeparated themſelves, looking the Barnes door by the ſame art they unlock'd it.</p>
                     <p>This Gentlemans Threſhers wonder'd ſtill when they came to ſee the ſheafs of Corn ſo diſorder'd and flung here and there, and in the ſtrangeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion imaginable; at firſt they ſuſpected this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order

The Maſter being informed of what had hapned, would not believe his ſervants till he had experimented the truth thereof himſelf; and thereupon goes to his Barn with his two ſervants, and there cauſed them to place before his eyes eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſheaf in good order, and ſo locking the door went home; the next morning he calls up his Thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhers and away he went to the Barn, and there found the ſheafs tumbled and ſcatter'd up and down, as his men had told him; he very much wonder'd how this ſhould be done, and his Barn door locked; however, he was reſolved to try once more, and ſo cauſed the ſheafs to be placed in order as formerly, and as formerly he found them the fecond time ſo diſorder'd, any, the third and fourth time; this ſomwhat ſtartled him, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing home, concluded ſome evil ſpirit owed him a ſpight, in thus diſordering and ſpoiling his Corn: The Threſhers hearing their Maſters judgment of this accident, on the morrow following, inſtead of going to threſh, their Maſter coming down from his chamber, finds his men gazing one upon the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his Hall, whereas he thought they were at the Barn, and demanding the reaſon hereof; they freely told him, that ſince they underſtood from his own Mouth that he believed the Devil haunted the Barn, the Devil ſhould take the Barn ere they would be ſo mad to bear him Company; The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman ſmiled at their ridiculous fears; and to depoſe them utterly of any ſuch belief, produced ſeveral good arguments, that it could not be, and ſo prevalent they were, as to perſwade them to go to the Barn, with this proviſo, he would go with

                     <p>The report of theſe fellows alarm'd the Town, poſſeſſing many with a belief that this might be a truth as to the haunting the Barn. A bold fellow in the Town, and one that had been a Trumpeter, makes his addreſs to the owner of the Barn, deſiring his leave to lie in the Barn one night; it was granted by the Gentleman with thanks; and the Trumpeter went that very night to the Barn with his Trumpet, and locking the Barn to him, placed himſelf in a corner thereof convenient for his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.</p>
                     <p>About the uſual time of theſe Gypſies repairing to the Barn, which was ſomewhat late, they came and enter'd the Barn, every one endeavouring to ſettle himſelf as well as he could; the Trumpeter ſeeing this, reſolv'd to try whether they were De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils or no by their diſlike to Muſick, and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſounded his Trumpet, at the ſound whereof, out ran the Gypſies as the Devil had drove them, and the Trumpeter after ſounding, the people there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ran out to know what was the matter that a Trumpet ſhould be ſounded at that time of night; the Trumpeter informed them that he had conjured the Devils out of the Barn they had ſo haunted, and that they might now diſpoſe of them as they pleaſed, whereupon they ſeized as many as they could and ſecuring them till next morning, by a Juſtice they were order'd to be whipt out of Town: thus with my ſtory I have ended my diſcourſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning an <hi>

                     <p>A <hi>Ruffler</hi> ever goes under the pretence of a maimed Soldier, if he ſtroles the Country, he lets not a Gentlemans houſe eſcape, having a Catalogue of them all along as he goeth for his more convenient calling upon them, he carrieth in his pocket (for the help of his memory) a Liſt of the old Commanders in the late Civil Wars which were noted Royaliſts, neither is he ignorant of ſome of their brave actions; he ſingles out the Heirs of ſuch deceaſed Commanders, and then tells them a formal ſtory, that they had the honor to ſerve under the Command of their worthy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in ſuch a Regiment, at ſuch a fight, as <hi>Naſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, Edghill, Newberry, Marſton-Moor, &amp;c.</hi> that in that ſervice he was lamed, that he hath ſince ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered all the misfortunes of an old Cavalier, and that being unable to work, he is now forced to beg becauſe he ſcorns to ſteal; and thus he goeth from one to another, having a good tongue in his head, and his tale at his fingers ends: but by the way, if he meets Country people coming late from Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, or any other feaſable booty, he will not ſtick to ſeiſe it, though he be hanged for his pains; and thus the <hi>Ruffler</hi> is metamorphoſed into a Low-Pad.</p>

                        <hi>PRiggers of Prancers,</hi> are Horſe-ſtealers; for <hi>Prig</hi> is to Steal, and <hi>Prancer</hi> is an Horſe; theſe Rogues ſeldome go without a light Briddle in their pockets, and a ſmall pad Saddle, which they can eaſily carry in their breeches, and being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd by their Spies abroad where good horſes run at Graſs, in the dead of the night will take them up in a moment, and will as ſoon ſteal an Horſe as another look over the Hedg. If they fear to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by the Field-keeper, then two or three of them will go together and boldly attack him, and having worſted him, bind and gag him, and ſo ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect their purpoſe, and will be far enough off, by break of day, from being overtaken; the neareſt Fair is then inquir'd after, where with all imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſpeed they ſell their ſtoln Horſes.</p>
                     <p>I have heard of ſome of theſe <hi>Priggers of Prancers</hi> that have been ſuch notable Artiſts, as that they could change the colour of an Horſes Cote, or make an artificial ſtar in an Horſes forehead, which ſhould laſt a conſiderable while, by which means the eyes of the right Owner have been ſo blinded, that he knew not his own Horſe when he ſaw him: Nay, when they have been confident that they have found their ſtoln Horſe, and by ſeveral remarkable tokens are aſſured thereof; yet the artificial ſtar in the forehead hath immediately ſpoiled that belief; and ſo have ſeen their own Horſes ſold before their own faces and toled, having always ſome notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Rogue as himſelf to vouch for him. This puts me in mind of a notable Story of a Serving-man,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:57215:41"/>who was pickt up by a pack of Rogues in the ſtteets and drilled into a Tavern, where having drank ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry high, they all took an opportunity to leave the Serving man for the Reckoning; this poor man finding himſelf pawn'd. and not having ſo much money to diſcharge the reckoning, watcht his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, and ſo gave the houſe the ſlip alſo; three days after his Maſter appointed a dinner at this very Tavern, his man uſed all the argument he could for to divert him from it, alledging there was bad Wine, ill Attendance, and the like; but all would not prevail, but that thither he went ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the appointed time; Dinner being on the Table, the Maſter of the Houſe was invited up for the ſake of his good company, being a very jol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and facetious man, at whoſe approach the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving-man knew not what to do. and had but one ſlender ſhift to keep him from being diſcovered, which he did by ſhutting one of his eyes as if he had been blind, and ſo continued keeping it ſhut whilſt he ſerv'd at table; the Vintner ſtared him ſo much in the face that his Maſter took notice thereof, and askt him why he gazed ſo much on his man; your pardon Sir, ſaid the Vintner, if I ſay that your man is as like a fellow that cheated me of an eighteen ſhilling reckoning as ever I ſaw in my life, and I would ſwear that he is the ſame but that this wants an eye, and the other had his ſight perfect. At this the Maſter askt his man how he came to be thus ſuddenly blind, having loſt an eye in leſs than an hours time; at which the man replied, being a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table crafty fellow, that if his Maſter would be pleaſed to forgive him, he would tell him the whole truth; his Maſter granted it, and hereupon the Serving-man inform'd him, how he had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded by a pack of Knaves, and how to ſecure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:57215:41"/>was forced to make his eſcape; that to conceal himſelf from the Vintners knowledg he had found out that ſtratagem of winking with one eye; the Maſter was ſo well pleaſed with the ſtory, that he pay'd the Vintner what was left to pay, and the Vintner was ſo well pleaſed to have reocived a debt ſo deſperate, that he gave the Serving-man a crown, to help to open his eye again.</p>
                     <p>But our <hi>Priggers</hi> Metamorphoſing of beaſts is much more undiſcoverable, by which means they frequently ſteal and ſafely ſell other mens Horſes; but let them have a care; the pitcher goes not ſo often to the well, but that it comes home broken at laſt.</p>

                        </gap>r artificial Sores. The way they commonly take to make them is by <hi>Spere-wort</hi> or <hi>Arſnick,</hi> which will draw bliſters; or they take unſlaked Lime and Soap, mingled with the ruſt of old Iron, theſe being well tempered together, and ſpread thick on two pieces of leather, they apply to the leg, binding it thereunto very hard, which in a very little time will fret the skin ſo, that the fleſh will appear all raw, then they take blood and rub it over the leg, which being fully dried makes the leg appear black, letting the ſeeming ſore peep out of ſome holes out of the Matteriſh clouts that are wrapt about it.</p>
                     <p>I ſaw a fellow not long ſince ſitting by the road ſide, on a Mudwall in the way to <hi>Iſlington</hi> (this was his conſtant ſtand on Sabbath days, there being at that time the greateſt concourſe of people if the Weather be fair) I ſay this fellow had one hand ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in a white cloath, and pinned to his breaſt, his cloaths were indifferent good, but had a better face by much, I mean an honeſt harmleſs look, and ſeemed ſo baſhful and modeſt that he beg'd of none but with his pale face and pittiful looks: and this way of begging prov'd more prevalent then the bawling of two or thre fellows that lay a little above him on the ground, with grievious ſore legs, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly not able to ſtand or go of them.</p>
                     <p>I obſerv'd this fellow ſeveral times in this very place, not imagining this ſilent Counterfeit was of the Society of thoſe clamorous Rogues who lay nigh him, till one day having an occaſion to go o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:57215:42"/>
                     <p>I took no notice of them at that time, no more then what my ears ſuffer'd by the hideous din of their execrable Oaths; not being longer able to be near them, I return'd home, reſolving to take the firſt opportunity to detect theſe Rogues. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I went with two or three more to the place ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the uſual time where theſe Beggars took up their ſtand to beg, and approaching my modeſt ſilent Mumper, <hi>I askt him what ailed his hand, or how he came by that lameneſs? To tell you the truth Sir, ſaid he, I am a poor Tranſlator, or Cobler com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called, and one day it was my miſchance, (and then the tears ſtood in his eyes) as I was working, to run the Awl quite through my hand; neglecting it, it feſter'd, ſo that now it is in a ſad condition, and not being able to work, I am ready to ſtarve, having ſold all my little ſtock already, either to cure my hand, or maintain my ſelf, but now all is gone. Alas poor man, ſaid It let me ſee your hand for I am a Chyrur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon. O Sir, cry'd the fellow, I ſhall die inſtantly if you open ie. Hereupon I graſped his pretended ſore hand very hard, and told him I would ſee it;</hi> at which he roar'd as if he had been on the Dutch Rack at <hi>Amboyna;</hi> which noiſe gathered abundance of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple about us, and every one condemning my hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartedneſs, till I told them what a cheat he was, and bid them if they would nor credit me, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve their own eyes, and ſo opened his hand, which was ſound and not hurt in the leaſt. Now good people ſecure this fellow, and you ſhall ſee I will diſcover more of the Gang yonder; the Cripples that lay a little way off hearing me ſay ſo, got up, and prov'd ſuch excellent footmen, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their pretended lameneſs, that though ſeveral followed them, yet none could come nigh them; which cauſed ſo great a laughter, with ſhooting,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:57215:43"/>that one would have thought the People half di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted. This fellow whom I had cauſed to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured was carried before a Juſtice, and from thence to Bridewell, where he received the ſevere laſh for his abominable hypocriſie.</p>
                     <p>A Story much like this I have heard of, done in <hi>Dorſetſhire.</hi> Once a year at a place called <hi>Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry-hill,</hi> on the top thereof is kept a Fair, and becauſe it is ſomewhat conſiderable, thither reſort the Beggars all round the Country, lying at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the hill begging in heaps. An arch Crack that had obſerved what counterfeit Rogues the major part of theſe were, went to the top of the hill, and unpinning a wheel took it off and brought it to the brow of the Hill, which was very high and indifferently ſteep, and crying out to the Beggars below, <hi>have at ye blind Harpers,</hi> lets the Wheel go, hereupon the Counterfeit cut the ſtrings to their counterfeit lame legs, and ran for it, and thoſe that had not the time for it, roled one over other, and by this confuſion (which was the moſt pleaſant and comical ſight could be ſeen) their Knavery was diſcovered loſing the benefit of that preſent Fair, and many more afterwards. More might be ſaid of the Clapperdogeon, but let this ſuffice.</p>

Nay, they have a trick to alter their voice, ſo that as their habit, face and hair are helps to their non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcevery; ſo their ſpeech (which one ſhould think) is undiſguiſable, adds very much to their concealment and ſecurity.</p>
                     <p>When they meet with a prize upon the Road, they have a Watch-word among themſelves, which is no ſooner pronounced, but every one falls to his work. This is the general rule they have among them, the ſtrongeſt and beſt at graſp ſeize firſt; the weaker only bid ſtand at firſt, and afterwards fall in according as occaſion requires; the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions given them, is to catch the bridle by the left hand, and to have the ſword in the right; if any oppoſition be made to cut ſoundly, and if likely to be over-powred, to kill as faſt as they can, and then either with booty or without, to fly with all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition. If they are purſued by an Hue and Cry, they were wont to obſcure themſelves in ſome place or other, and let it paſs by them. How much the Roads of late have been peſter'd by them is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to few, notwithſtanding ſo many of them have been taken and Executed at Tyburn; Now to the intent you may be wary of them, take theſe following ſafe and wholſome Inſtructions.</p>
                     <pb n="90" facs="tcp:57215:50"/>
                     <p>Firſt, If you are about to take a Journy, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal the time as near as you can, and the charge you intend to carry with you; it is a Cuſtome no leſs common then indiſcreet, for perſons to blaze abroad among their reputed friends, the time of their intended departure, and out of meer vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory, tell what ſum of money they carry with them; this hath been often times the cauſe of their being way-laid, for there is not ſo found a Flock of Sheep, but there may be one ſcabby, ſo in a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety one <hi>Judas,</hi> that for gain to ſhare a fourth of the prize, will betray a man to theſe Bully-Ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fins of the Road.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, When you come into your Inn, have a care you diſcover nothing of your concern to the Hoſtler, Chamber lain or Hoſt himſelf; the two firſt are commonly bribed, or are in Pention with the <hi>High-Pad,</hi> and the laſt in expectation of a ſhare, or good ſtore of Money ſpent in his houſe profuſely, will either from your own mouth vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily, or by pumping, endeavour to diſcover where the booty lieth, and how much, and infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation inſtantly given to the <hi>High-Pad.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Be not eaſily perſwaded to aſſociate your ſelf with Strangers on the Road, but rather endeavour to ſhun ſuch as are too forward to preſs into your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; if you have a ſuſpition of ſuch company, lag a little behind; and if you ſee them halt alſo before, by alighting or otherwiſe, provide for your ſafety with what ſpeed you can.</p>
                     <p>Suſpect all thoſe that diſguiſe themſelves in any manner, by throwing a long Cloak over there ſhoulders, wearing a Vizard Mask, falſe be ard, Perruke, &amp;c. Or if they have none of theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſes, yet ſtill appead ſuſpitious, look their full in the face, and if they turn their heads aſide being
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:57215:50"/>unwilling to be viewed by you; this is an infallible mark of an High-way man: there are many more marks to diſcover theſe Deſperado's, by which I omit, becauſe they will take up too much time in the Deſcription.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall therefore give you ſome inſtructions for your ſafety in Travelling: If you ride with a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Charge, chooſe rather to Travel by night then by day; for this is held as an undeniable truth among theſe Catter-pillars, that none will ride by night that are worth the robbing: beſides, theſe High-way men in prudence take up their Inn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, to avoid the ſuſpition of being accounted and apprehended for Rogues by being abroad ſo late.</p>
                     <p>Chooſe when you travel, the By-Roads; for your High-way men generally ſelect the Roads which are moſt common and beaten, that they may have their choiſe of booties, and not ſtreightned in their prize.</p>
                     <p>If you are five or ſix in Company, keep a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable diſtance one from the other when you come to ſome noted place for Robbery, and do not hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle all together; this will conduce much to your ſafety, for by this means the Pads will be affraid to aſſault you thus ſtragling, leaſt one or other eſcape and ſo raiſe the Country: What elſe hath been or may be ſaid of this Subject, I ſhall refer you to the <hi>firſt part of the ENGLISH ROG<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>E;</hi> wherein you may be more fully informed.</p>

                     <p>He is not of ability to ride on Horſe-back, and therefore skulks under hedges in the Road, and with a long Pole knock a man down as he rides a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, or immediately and ſuddenly ſtarts out from his covert, and ſeizing the bridle another comes and diſmounts him, and ſo rob him.</p>

                     <p>The Perſons of whom I do intend my Diſcourſe were ſolely bent upon this irregular Humour;

                        <hi>Craftsby</hi> being now grown Old, the heat of whoſe youthful blood being by Age now near upon extinguiſht, minded her profit only; and that her Niece <hi>Miſtreſs Wheedle</hi> might not too violently proſecute her pleaſurable inclinations, ſhe ſtopt them in their career by a watchful Eye and Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Inſtructions.</p>
                     <p>The Subtle <hi>Bawd</hi> was glad to ſee her towring Spirit to ſoar above her mean and low born for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, to the ſupplying of which defect, ſhe dayly plum'd her head with Ingenious conceits, which in time might be wrought into ſuch deceits as ſhe aim'd at, and ſo it prov'd for dazled with theſe falſe appearances, they both forſook Vertue, the difficult yet the only direct road to Glory, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing their ſatisfactions in the crooked and by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paths of Subtlety and Circumventing all which come with in the verge of their power ſo to effect their purpoſe.</p>

                        <hi>Miſtriſs Craftsby</hi> had a very good natural <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> quick of apprehenſion, and though ſhe had a very nimble invention, yet contrary to General obſervation ſhe had likewiſe a capacious Memory, its faculties were ſo retentive ſhe never heard any <hi>Ingenious</hi> expreſſion once which was not after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards abſolutely her own; her beauty was not much fam'd though her face was very well featur'd and faſhion'd, her ſtature was middle ſiz'd, her body plump and fleſhy, her hair of a dark brown and an eye as black as a ſlow, with eye brows ſo large and thick, that Nature ſeem'd prodigal in planting thereon ſo much, that if half could have been tranſplanted 'twould have been more then ſufficient to have adern'd the face of ſome antient Citizen made barren by the coldneſs of his o're frigid Nature.</p>
                     <p>She very much affected gaudy apparel, and was a great hater of labour and pains taking, the firſt ſhe could not purchaſe in the Country, by reaſon of the poverty of her Relations, labour ſhe was continually exerciſed in, which made her enter tain ſo great an averſion to the Country, that nothing could oppoſe her Reſolution of ſeeing <hi>London,</hi> and that which haſtned her departure, was the inſufferable diſlike ſhe took to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of her Country Neighbours, there being no proportion between her and their Humours, nor finding any thing agreable in their Rural paſtimes. <hi>Suſans</hi> intended departure (for that was her Chriſtian name) being generally ſpread abroad, a univerſal grief poſſeſt the Inhabitants of that Pariſh wherein ſhe liv'd, but more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially two Young men, the one a Wheel-Right and the other a Serving-Man; the laſt followed her to <hi>London,</hi> and not finding her loſt his Wits,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:57215:61"/>and was put into Bedlam, where he trifled away his time in Straw and making Congies to a poſt inſtead of his <hi>Miſtreſs,</hi> till he dyed; the other was no leſs forward in the purchaſing of his love than the former who went for <hi>London</hi> alſo, and miſſing his <hi>Miſtreſs</hi> wheel'd off to Sea, whoſe flames were quencht in the bottom of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean.</p>
                     <p>The time being come for her departure, ſhe mounted on a pack, and ſate as if ſhe was riding on a Cammel, in her beſt Countrey livery, that is to ſay, ſhe had a ſtraw hat, a green Waſtcoat, and red Petticoat, with Hob-naild ſhoo's which would ſtrike Fire at every ſtep, the Emblem of what Fire works ſhe would make when ſhe arriv'd at her journeys end.</p>
                     <p>Coming to <hi>London,</hi> the reputation of a harmleſs <hi>Country-Girle,</hi> and a good comely Face, ſoon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced her into a ſervice, where having learn'd ſomewhat more than ſhe underſtood in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and by her ſervice having gotten good Cloths on her Back, ſhe imagined the place wherein ſhe lived too low to advance her to that height to which her fancy dayly prompted her; neither were the Amorous pretences and inſinvations of her Maſters Apprentice able to detain, although the grand Obligation of a promiſed marriage was contained therein; I concieve the ſtay of three Years, was too long for one in her longing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
                     <p>The only place ſhe inquired after was a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants Houſe, as creditable in the firſt place, and next, as there was more probability of advancing her fortunes by matching with ſome deluded <hi>Caſheer</hi> and ſhe was encouraged to this confidence by the many matches ſhe had heard of in this nature by
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:57215:61"/>ſuch who were as full of hopes as ſhe was, of thriving in this kind.</p>
                     <p>A Service ſhe ſoon got in a Houſe as ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, which, for external ſplendor and internal accommodations, was little inferior to any Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants in the whole City.</p>
                     <p>Here ſhe behaved her ſelf ſo well, that ſhe gain'd the love and favor of the whole Houſe, and ſo craftily ſhe counterfeited a becomming modeſty that her Maſters <hi>Caſheer</hi> entertain'd for her a love within his breaſt that is not common, the more his Reaſon indeavored to ſuppreſs, it became more Violent, and giving it no vent it was ready to breake that wherein it was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd.</p>
                     <p>She like a cunning Gypſie percieved well the malady of his mind, but would not take the leaſt notice of it, and inſtead of quenching that over grown flame which ſhe had blown up by her alluring ſubtle practices, her winning carriage and ſeeming compliance to every thing he ſeem'd to deſire, added new fewel thereunto dayly.</p>
                     <p>He could now no longer keep in that which would have its free courſe in ſpight of all oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions whatſoever, and now it violently broke out like Powder fir'd, making a report ſo much the greater by how much it is pent up in a narrow Circumference.</p>
                     <p>When other careleſs Souls are dead in ſleep, or ſuffer themſelves to be led Captive in leaden Chains, by that heavy headed God Morpheus, the careful Lover is ever watchful, his eyes can find no reſt, becauſe of thoſe continual Alarums the panting Heart doth beat on his troubled Amorous breaſt.</p>

                        <hi>Suſan</hi> being informed that he would relate ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of importance that night to her, thought every hour ſeven till the family was gone to bed, and he every hour ſeventy till he might have ſome aſſurance of his bedding with his Love.</p>
                     <p>The houſe being now in a profound Silence, he ſteals out of his own Chamber, and ſoftly trips down the ſtairs into the <hi>Kitching</hi> where his Love attended his coming.</p>
                     <p>Low was their talk but high was the paſſion they had reciprocally for each other, that ſighs and looks were forc't to ſupply the place of ſpeech, diſcovering what their tongues were incapable of uttering, and Kiſſes ſupplyd the defects of all the reſt.</p>
                     <p>His warm touches and frequent embraces did melt her into complacency ſo that on both ſides never were their made ſo many Amorous promiſes as between theſe two Lovers, he ſwore and damn'd himſelf a thouſand times if ever he broke his faith with her, and ſhe vow'd and proteſted ſhe would never be unfaithful to him, upon this Obligation ſhe condeſcended the next night he ſhould lie with her with this <hi>Proviſo,</hi> that if ſhe be with Child he ſhould marry her incontinently, but if no ſuch thing hapned to defer it ſome time longer, this agreement was Seal'd interchangeably by Kiſſes on each ſide, and ſo they went to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Chambers.</p>
                     <p>The Maſter of the Houſe <hi>(whom we ſhall call</hi> Mr. <hi>Tradewell)</hi> had a Partner and his Wife in the Houſe with him, whom for the better carrying on the Story, we muſt call by the name of Mr. <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware.</hi> this Merchant was gone into <hi>France</hi> about ſome Affair that concerned the Partnerſhip, and left his Wife behind him to the care of Mr. <hi>Trade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi>

                     <p>This abſence of her Husband gave him all the advantages a Lover could require, neither was he backward in the vſing of ſuch means that might accompliſh his irregular defires; he had made ſeveral attempts but ſtill was repulſt, at length he reſolv'd to ſummon together all his force and give her one home Charge more, or one Vigorous aſſault before he would raiſe his Siege; the time deſigned was the next day, after the night the <hi>Caſheer</hi> and <hi>Suſan</hi> had agreed to the aſſignation of each others <hi>Maiden-Heads</hi> the night follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>The day being come and when one half or more thereof was ſpent, Mr. <hi>Tradewell</hi> ſingles out his game (<hi>fair to Admiration</hi>) and reſolved to hit his mark.</p>
                     <p>You may therefore Swear he did not fright her Ear, with the dreadful ſtories of horred <hi>Dutch</hi> cruelties in <hi>Amboyna,</hi> nor what will become of that ungrateful <hi>Nation</hi> hereafter, but how he might make a Conqueſt over Chaſtity.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Selware</hi> heard his temptations with much ſeeing impatience and reluctancy, offring fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to be gone, but eaſily ſtayd by her aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailant; ſhe fretted and fumed at the walls as if they were acceſſory to her detention whereas the door ſtood wide open, or had it been lockt one Skreeke or two would have as nimbly opened it as the Key thereunto belonging; having flounſt
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:57215:63"/>and flung up and down, She at length <hi>(recovering breath)</hi> thus capitulates with him: <hi>Where note that Fortreſs or Citadel that admits of a Parley with her Aſſailent is already half Surrendred.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <q>O Mr. <hi>Tradewell</hi> I did not think you were a Man ſo looſly given, how can you thus offer to injure four at once, your Wives Vertue, my Husbands friendſhip, my Chaſtity, and moſt of all your own Soul.</q>

                        <hi>Tradewell</hi> had a tongue moſt excellently well hung, with wit at will, by which he ſo handled the matter, that he cleared theſe Scruples, making her believe that forreign Nations publickly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted <hi>(Adjutores Tori;)</hi> helpers in the marriage bed; and that it was freely granted by the husband that ſhe ſhould make choice of any one friend whom ſhe pleaſed, that here at home ſuch things were winked at, elſe how comes it about it ſhould grow ſo Faſhionable for Women to have a Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant beſides their Husbands, who ſhall not only participate of the pleaſure of the Wife, but the profits alſo of the Husband.</p>

                     <p>This news did not a little pleaſe <hi>Suſan</hi> and the <hi>Caſheer,</hi> as thinking they ſhould the ſooner and longer injoy their eagerly expected pleaſures; every finger that <hi>Suſan</hi> had, ſupply'd the place of a hand to diſpatch Supper, which being ready was diſht up, and Mr. <hi>Tradewell</hi> and his Wiſe with <hi>Miſtreſs Saleware</hi> ſeating themſelves.</p>

                     <p>Mr. <hi>Tradewell</hi> partly by the ſtrength of imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and partly by thoſe flames, the incomparable beauty and over kind promiſes his Partners Wife had kindled in him, made him even ready to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve as <hi>Snow</hi> againſt the Scorching rays of the <hi>Meridean Sun;</hi> Fancy made him think he was already incircled in her arms and clung as cloſe as Jvies to the Elme; ſometimes he thought he heard the Raviſhing twang of her harmonical Lace againſt her Bodice, making her ſelf unready to be the more ready to his devotion.</p>
                     <p>As Supper ended ſo did the diſcourſe, for Mr. <hi>Tradewell</hi> counterfiting a bad Sentinel fell faſt a ſleep pretendedly; this made <hi>Miſtreſs Saleware</hi> retire, to give opportunity to Mr. <hi>Tradewell</hi> to put her Husband to bed, who <hi>(understanding from himſelf that his buſineſs would call him up very Early next morning)</hi> awaked him out of his ſleep deſiring him to take his reſt in Bed: Mr. <hi>Tradewell</hi> ſtarting as one too ſuddainly diſturbed out of his ſleep, anſwer'd <hi>(raiſing himſelf and rubbing his Eyes)</hi> goe to Bed Sweet-heart, I will but goe down and give ſome inſtructions to my man what is to be done to morrow, and Order them to goe to Bed, I will inſtantly return; having given what Orders he thought convenient below, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up he renew'd the former diſcourſe with <hi>Miſtreſs Saleware</hi> and confirmed the contract; he return'd to his own Chamber, where he found his Wife in Bed, and undreſſing himſelf went to Bed alſo and to prevent toying with his Wife fell immediately <hi>(but feignedly)</hi> into a profound ſleep.</p>

                     <p>Every one in the Houſe were now paying the quiet Tribute due to Pains-taking, indulgent Nature excepting the aforementioned Lovers: <hi>Mistreſs Saleware</hi> lay (improperly) above Mr. <hi>Trade-well, Suſan</hi> in a little room next him, the <hi>Caſheer</hi> a good way diſtant; <hi>Mistreſs Saleware</hi> and <hi>Suſan</hi> placed their ears to the beſt advantage that they might hear the firſt tread of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Amorous viſitants, you muſt think they hearkned with as much attention, as a dying Patient would hear the Phyſitians ſentence of Life or Death, privately whiſpered into the Ear of ſome friend ſtanding by.</p>

                     <p>You may imagine he was very careful of tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hard, yet though he went ſoftly, he could not hinder the creaking of the boards, which cauſed a double Alarum, the one to his <hi>Mistreſs</hi> of his approach, and the other of fear to himſelf, leaſt thereby he might awake his Wife and ſo ſhe find him abſent, the conſideration hereof made his heart to imitate a <hi>Drummer</hi> in the beating of a point of War.</p>
                     <p>Coming to her Chamber door, he cald to her in ſo low a voice he could not hear himſelf; yet ſhe could perfectly at a good diſtance and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly give him admiſſion.</p>
                     <p>What they ſpeedily went about you may ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, and therefore it is needleſs to give you an account of every Amorous folly theſe two Lovers were guilty of that time, which lay in Action more than expreſſion, and no wonder ſince kiſſes barracaded up their ſpeech.</p>
                     <p>Having tired each others lipps, they then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred with their Leggs and Arms, but how, my modeſty will not give me leave to tell.</p>
                     <p>No doubt they ran their Poſts or Stages with uncontrouled Eagerneſs; like an high mettled Horſe which at firſt mounting will Carvete and Caper, and without the leaſt touch of Switch or Spur will bounce and foam at mouth, nay fret it ſelf out of Breath; but let us leave theſe Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions of <hi>Venus,</hi> and give an account of what hapned in this interval, as a juſt reward and a remarkable caſual revenge on <hi>Tradewells</hi> infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
                     <p>About half an hour after this diſloyal Husband had left the warm Bed of his hitherto conſtant
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:57215:65"/>Bed-fellow to go a catterwowling, his Caſhier (who was about the age of twenty, a handſome lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty Lad) got out of his Bed, having ſlept againſt his will, and not knowing how much of the night had ſlipt away, rubbing his eyes between ſleeping and waking, he gropes his way in the dark to find out <hi>Suſans</hi> Chamber; but inſtead thereof, entred into that of his Miſtreſſes: The firſt thing he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred with was the Bed, and finding it ſo quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, doubted not but that he was right, concluding the narrowneſs of the room guided him to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and purpoſe; whereupon lifting up the clothes ſoftly, he laid himſelf down by her ſide; he was not long there, e're he began to buſtle (not as if he was ſetling himſelf in order to his repoſe) which ſoon awaked his Miſtreſs, who believing it was her Husband, embraced him with an ardent affection, ſaying, My deareſt Joy, how cold you are? Come, put thy legs within mine, I'le warm them for thee; and then diſcharg'd a whole vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of kiſſes on him: thoſe being over, ſhe talk'd to him again. My dear Husband, I'le tell thee what I juſt now dreamt: Methought I heard your man open your maids Chamber door, and talkt of things not fit to be ſpoke; being throughly vext my Houſe ſhould be made a Brothel by your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, I endeavoured to riſe to prevent them in their Roguery, ſtruggling to get up, and feeling for thee to tell thee what I was going about, I could not find thee in the Bed; this ſo ſtrangely did ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize my mind, that through fear, vexation, and I know not what, I inſtantly awoke, and glad I am that it is but a Dream, and that I have thee in mine Arms.</p>
                     <p>Theſe actions and expreſſions clearly convinc't him that he was in an errour, and that ſhe which
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:57215:66"/>expreſt ſo many indearments, and which had ſo ſtricktly ſhackled him within her arms, was his Miſtreſs.</p>
                     <p>At firſt he was almoſt dead with fear, but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving recollected his ſcattered Spirits, and bethought himſelf of this ſtratageme to preſerve himſelf from diſcovery, all paſſages that ever he obſerved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his Maſter and Partners Wife came freſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his mind, and from all the circumſtances con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that they were now conſummating their loves. and that if he could but refrain from ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he doubted not but that ſhe would fall aſleep again, and ſo have the opportunity of ſtealing a way, to be as good as his promiſe.</p>
                     <p>But jealouſly in her dream had ſo kindled her fire, that abandoning for that time the becoming modeſty of her Sex, ſhe grew ſo impatient of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays, that he found himſelf incapable of reſiſting thoſe emotions ſhe had rais'd within him, but ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd himſelf to be taught by her thoſe Love-leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, were deſigned him by another Love-School Miſtreſs; ſhe had ſo warm'd her Caſhier, that had he been Marble, or a <hi>Myſanthropos,</hi> a mortal ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to Mankind, he muſt have then laid aſide his innate hate and emnity to be reconcil'd to ſuch a loving Enemy.</p>
                     <p>This Combat laſted a long time without any conſiderable advantage perceivable on either ſide, but being equally tired, they both willingly ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a retreat. And now it was time for her to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that theſe embraces were more vigorous and fierce than ſuch which are the attendants to a Marriage-bed, unuſually accompanied with ſuch frequent Repetitions: Beſides his conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſilence all this while did ſtrangely ſtartle her, which with the former, gave her ſufficient
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:57215:66"/>grounds to ſuſpect ſhe was miſtaken in her Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellow.</p>
                     <p>The poor foundred Caſhier was in a peck of troubles, not knowing how to get out of that La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinth he had caſually wound himſelf into; each minute he dreaded his Maſters apprehending him in bed with his Miſtreſs, and what puniſhment could he expect leſs than his Maſters Dagger plung'd to the hilts in his traiterous breaſt; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon an univerſal Palſie ſeized upon every Limb, but this trepidation of his joynts, his Miſtreſs fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably interpreted the product of his paſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, or of deſire of enjoying more, and not at all the effect of fear.</p>
                     <p>After a thouſand diſtracting cogitations, the Caſhier having weigh'd each particular in the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of his green underſtanding, conſidered that it might be of a dangerous conſequence to ask pardon of his Miſtreſs for what had paſt between them, and then again to riſe when his Miſtreſs was aſleep without diſcovering to her the miſtake, would the next day undoubtedly betray the whole matter, by her petulancie, or ſome little toying and wanton diſcourſe between her and his Maſter; and who knows not but that ſhe might too amply acknowledge his gratitude for his late ſuppoſed works of Supererrogation, which might give him cauſe to conclude (as it was but juſt) that his man had ſuppli'd his laſt nights abſence, for none other in the family could be ſuſpected. The ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of danger from the diſcovery of a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of this great importance, did put him in ſo great a confuſion, that it was not to be judg'd which was greater, the pleaſure he had obtain'd, or the trouble and fear he underwent in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe thereof. Whileſt his thoughts were ingaged
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:57215:67"/>in this perplexity a ſtratagem bolted into his head, which in all probability might remedy all; and thus it was, he reſolved to take no notice of any thing ſhe uttered ſaving the Dream, making her believe that he thought himſelf in bed with <hi>Suſan</hi> and none elſe, and therefore (grumbling a little firſt) he thus ſpoke:</p>
                     <p>Prethee, my Dear, what didſt thou mean by that Dream thou told'ſt me, the matter I value not, but 'tis the manner of telling it troubles me; thy language therein was more like my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs than my Love; Why doſt thou call me Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant whenas I intend to be thy Husband? But I will not chide, ſince I did not think to have been ſo favourably received by thee; and ſince I find thy love cordial (ſpeaking to her with a Kiſs) were I interrupted from thy embracements, by the interpoſition of an Arm of the Sea, wider and more dangerous than that loving <hi>Leander</hi> once too often croſt ſwimming to ſee his ſportive <hi>Hero,</hi> I would do it with as much alacrity and willingneſs as for ſtriding a Brook obtain a Lordſhip. Dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, ſaid he, what is the matter? Why ſo ſilent? Fear nothing, our Miſtreſs, poor Gentlewoman, is faſt aſleep, ſhe like an harmleſs innocent little dreams of the ingratitude and treachery of her la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcivious Husband, who is now at this very nick of time in the height of his enjoyments with Mrs. <hi>Saleware.</hi> At theſe words ſhe became more ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd and amaz'd than ever <hi>Alcmene</hi> was of old, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Jupiter</hi> had enjoy'd her in the ſhape of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phitreo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But ſeeing there was no remedy for ſo ſtrange an Accident which had made her break her Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-Vow, ſhe comforted her ſelf in that the fault, if it was any, was not deſign'd by her, but all the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:57215:67"/>guilt ought to lie on her diſloyal Husband; and indeed I know not how that can properly be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a fault which was done unwittingiy; beſides, ſhe could not but applaud the Juſtice of Heaven, puniſhing him in the ſame manner he had abuſed others. Mrs. <hi>Tradewel</hi> was ſomewhat loath to part with the Company of her new Bed-fellow, but reaſon perſwaded her to it for the avoiding dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, wherefore ſlipping a Diamond-ring off her finger ſhe convey'd it into the hands of her Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, ſaying in a very low voice, if you are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet hug in ſilence your good fortune, otherwiſe you ſhall find a reward ſutable to your babbling folly.</p>
                     <p>Hereupon without replying a word, he got out of the Bed, and paſſing by the Chamber of his poor cheated <hi>Suſan,</hi> he entred into his own, and went to ſleep; how and in what manner ſhe took and revenged this intollerable affront, I ſhall anon give you a farther account.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Tradewel</hi> had not been in bed with his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved <hi>Saleware</hi> above two hours, but that Mr. <hi>Saleware</hi> being return'd from <hi>France,</hi> and land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Graveſend,</hi> took a pair of Oars and came ſtraight away for <hi>London</hi> with an affectionate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to have a ſpeedy ſight of his intirely beloved Wife, and about one a Clock landed at <hi>Billings<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi> and thence with all ſpeed went to his Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; where coming he knock at the back-door for the convenience of ſpeedy entrance, the Skul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-boy lying juſt over the Gate, and ſo ſoon got in, making the boy to ſtrike a light, and with it went directly to his Chamber, where theſe two Lovers were more intangled with each other than <hi>Mars</hi> was by the craft of <hi>Vulcan</hi> with the <hi>Cyprian</hi> Goddeſs. He knockt at the door two or three
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:57215:68"/>times, but his Wife being other wayes employed then to come out of a warm bed and indanger of catching of cold, was as mute as a fiſh, neither could ſhe in Reaſon ſpeak till the buſineſs ſhe was about was conſummated; but he without repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his knocks, ſhe was forced at length to ask, who was there, in words imperfect, as juſt diſturb'd out of a profound ſleep. It is I, ſaid her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. Who are you, ſhe repli'd. 'Tis I, your Husband, ſaid <hi>Saleware,</hi> don't you know my voice? She thus capitulated with him that ſhe might have time to abſcond her Lover; the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denneſs of the ſurprize would not permit her to conſult long about it, neither was there any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place of ſecurity, but underneath the Bed; which <hi>Tradewel</hi> was forc't to crawl under; that being done, ſeemingly in great haſte ſhe ran to the door, ſpeaking as ſhe went, <hi>My Soul, O my deareſt Heart, art thou return'd? The moſt welcome man to me in the world;</hi> whil'ſt ſhe thought in her heart what envious Devil brought thee hither at this juncture of time, thus to obſtruct my early joys?</p>
                     <p>The door being opened, Mr. <hi>Saleware</hi> entred in, and as he was about to run and catch her in his arms, the ſight of her in a manner naked, diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her delicate Breaſts, put him to a ſtand that he might pleaſe his eyes before he feaſted his other ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; this ſmall time of abſence had given him new appetite, and ſo impatient he grew, that he thought undreſſing himſelf to be the way about and too long for the renewing his delight, and therefore would have cut it ſhorter; but ſhe which already had had the ſatisfaction of a more vigorous and active ſubject, knew how to defend her ſelf againſt the weak aſſaults of an impotent
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:57215:68"/>Husband: to qualifie him, for the preſent the de ſir'd him to have patience, if not, he might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental in bringing her into ſome dangerous Diſtemper, by catching cold coming ſweating out of a warm bed. This perſwaſion made him the more haſty to go to bed, his Wife in the mean time conſidering with what difficulty her Gallant almoſt ſtarv'd with cold) muſt creep from under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the bed to acquit himſelf of the Chamber, and the danger of ſtaying longer in it, and withal knowing how impoſſible it would be to ſteal from her Husband, or if ſhe did, the creaking of the door might betray her, ſhe ſuddenly pumpt out of her invention, a pretty device to blind her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and ſecure her friend: <hi>Womens wits are ever moſt ready at a puſh in the greateſt ſtraights.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As her Husband was making himſelf unready, ſhe caught him about the neck, ſaying, hold, hold, my dear Heart, prethee let's drink a glaſs of Wine for joy of thy return, I have half a dozen bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles which were lately ſent me as a preſent, the beſt thou didſt ever taſte of in all thy life, prethee ſtep down into the Cellar, there is but one left, it ſtands in the fartheſt corner of the Cellar: with all my heart, ſaid her Husband; in order to his going down he reputs on his Doublet, and having button'd it by halves, he ſtands up to look for his ſhooes which he had careleſly dropt off his feet, but could find but one, the other it ſeems tumbled under the bed where <hi>Tradewel</hi> lay, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to grope with his hands underneath the Bed, which had like to have frighted our <hi>Inamorata</hi> and and his Miſtreſs out of their wits; but ſeeing his ſearch was in vain, he went to the Table to fetch the Candle, the wife ſeeing this, lept nimbly out of Bed and pretending to be angry for his ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:57215:69"/>ſo long barefoot on the cold ground, ſnatcht the Candle out of his hand, ſaying, is it poſſible, Husband, that you ſhould be thus long looking for your ſhooe and not find it? Come, you ſhall ſtand no longer on the bare bords, I'le rather ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer than you; and thereupon lookt for the ſhooe where ſhe knew it was impoſſible to find it. The Husband ſeeing his wife thus walk up and down barefoot, in a great paſſion told her, that unleſs ſhe was reſolv'd to be acceſſary to her own death, ſhe would not do as ſhe did; therefore, ſaid he, let me command you to go to your bed, and do not expoſe your tender body to thoſe injuries which accompany a cold winter ſeaſon.</p>
                     <p>Let any one judge whether Mr. <hi>Tradewel</hi> were not in a ſweet pickle at the hearing of theſe words, and Mrs. <hi>Saleware</hi> was at her wits ends, thinking now there was no hope of uſing any other falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, concluding the beſt Inventions in this caſe barren, and that it lay not in the power of the ſharpeſt and craftieſt wit to find out a way that may deliver them from this imminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
                     <p>Now did Mr. <hi>Saleware</hi> in a ſeeming rage ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advance to ſnatch the Candle from his Wife; ſhe pretending to prevent him, with an over-officious care not to put him to the trouble, ſeemed to flumble (in her ſtarting back) at the foot of the Table, and thereby fell, and by her fall extinguiſht ſnuff and and all; whil'ſt her Husband was gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping for the Candle, with all ſpeed ſhe got to the bed to adviſe <hi>Tradewel</hi> that this was the time, if ever, to make his eſcape undiſcovered, ſhe durſt not ſpeak, and therefore ſhe did thruſt her arm underneath the Bed and caught him by the foot; <hi>Tradewel</hi> thinking that the hand he felt was that
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:57215:69"/>of him he had ſo injur'd, and therefore now did juſtly fear, knew not what to do, thinking it was to little purpoſe to endeavour his further conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and judged he had no means left but to crawl out upon all four, and in that poſture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing the whole matter, beg pardon of his injur'd friend; but perceiving that the perſon that held him by the foot pull'd him but gently, without the utterance of one word, he alterr'd his reſolution, knowing it muſt be his Friend; after this ſhe found the ſhooe and gave it her Husband, who by this time had found the Candle, which ſhe fear'd he had given to the Devil to light, and now ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats him afreſh to go down into the Kitching, and light the Candle (there being always ſome fire all night long) and thereby fulfil her requeſt; <hi>Saleware</hi> by the charming perſwaſions of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle wife, condeſcended to every thing ſhe deſir'd; he was no ſooner gone, but ſhe haſtned her Gal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> lant with all ſpeed imaginable out of the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; who ſeeing himſelf freed and at liberty was the joyfulleſt man living, notwithſtanding he was ſo benumm'd with cold that he lookt like the third Son of <hi>Ice-icle Winter,</hi> his ſhirt (by removing himſelf on this ſide and that, for his better ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity) was ſo black by rubbing the boards, that he lookt like a Small-Coal-man, and his Hair, which like Lime-twiggs had enſnared the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers underneath the bed, made his head appear more like an Owls than a Common-Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans; and which was worſe, he had ſo bepiſt himſelf by the fright he was in, that he ſtunck like a Polecat. In ſhort, his looks were ſo ghaſtly, and his face ſo pall'd and wan, that the moſt rational would have taken him for a Spectre or Phantaſm, ſo ſtrange was his Metamorphoſis in time of this
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:57215:70"/>ſhort though ſharp Purgatory; but all this was nothing to what he ſuffered by his Caſhier; one nights repoſe would reſettle him and reſtore his former quietude and ſerene temper, but the injury he ſuſtain'd in the abuſe of his Wife was remedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs: Beſides had he been diſcovered by his Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, who knows the dangers that jealouſie and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge might procure to proſecute an act ſo foul and ſo ingrateful: The miſchiefs are innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable they run themſelves into, who ſlighting Heaven by contemning the good Laws of man, are led away by their brutiſh appetites and inordinate ſenſuality.</p>
                     <p>Conſider then again, how blind and irrational ſome are who having wives whoſe beauties may diſpute for eminencie with the choiceſt of the Creation, whoſe diſcretion, modeſty and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence was never call'd in Queſtion by any foul miſcarriage, whoſe honeſty and nuptial fidelity is as ſpotleſs white as innocence her ſelf; yet I ſay, theſe very men regarding neither the Laws of of God nor Nature (<hi>More ferarum Quadrupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dumque</hi>) by invading other mens rights, endeavor their ſatisfaction with ſuch whoſe Perſons, Wit, Beauty and Behaviour fall as ſhort of that which adorns their own faithful Companions, as the ſplendour of the ſerene Sun outſhines the gloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineſs of an eclipſed Moon. In ſhort, men ſhould forbear entertaining ſuch looſe and unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful deſires, if not for the ſake of Heaven, yet for the love they ought to bear to their health and honour: But to return where we left.</p>

                        <hi>Tradewel,</hi> thus pickled in duſt, feathers, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, durſt not approach his own bed, but thought it very expedient to go to the Chamber of his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhier, but before he could come at it he muſt paſs

Impatient of waiting longer ſhe had got out of Bed, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſlipt on her Petticoat, ſhe was going out with an intention of going to viſit her faithleſs Friend, at the ſame time her Maſter came tripping down the ſtairs from Mr. <hi>Saleware;</hi> by a little glimme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring light ſhe perceived ſomewhat in white, at firſt ſight ſhe was ſomewhat affrighted ſuggeſting that this might be ſome Spirit, had undoubtedly ſcreekt out, had ſhe not preſently bethought her ſelf that in all probability this was her unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Friend who had ſlighted her for a more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent beauty above, and was now return'd from thoſe petulant delliances which properly belong'd to her by Oaths, Vows, &amp; Proteſtations, imboldned with the conſideration hereof, ſhe ſeiz'd ſuddenly on his ſhirt as he was paſſing by, and not regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the propinquity of her Miſtreſſes Chamber to hers, in theſe terms ſhe upbraided him, <hi>O Sir, have I caught you, are theſe the fruits of your laſt nights Promiſes, can the current of your love ſo ſoon run in another Channel?

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:57215:71"/>lately done, and now verily believed that in often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation his Miſtreſs had told her Husband how luc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kily (though not wittingly) ſhe was reveng'd of his baſe diſloyalty, and that his Maſter not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how to wreak his revenge on her was come to diſcharge it on him. <hi>As Vice is commonly the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of fear, ſo he who is afraid ever ſuſpects the worst.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In ſhort, fear had ſo univerſally poſſeſt him, that there was no room left for one rational con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration; all courage had forſaken this acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental offending <hi>Smell-ſmock,</hi> and the expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his enſuing puniſhment had ſtew'd him in a a cold ſweat, or rather was diſſolving him into one of the Elements of his firſt compoſition; you could not now call him Man, but the Decoction thereof (Neither was mans limbs ſo ſhak'd with the cold fits of a Quartan Ague, as this ſame quaking jelly was by his panick fear; ſometimes he thought to leap out of the Window, &amp; adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture an arm or a leg rather than run the hazard of loſing — he knew not what; altering that reſolution, he thought it better to caſt himſelf on his knees at the feet of his Maſter, confeſſing his (not purpoſed) fault, and implore his pardon; with this reſolution, he opened the door, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the light of the Moon (which was juſt then riſen) the pallid and bloodleſs hue of his ſhive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Maſters face, looking more like that of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurer than one tranſported with a jealous paſſion, recollected himſelf and took courage to ſpeak to him. <hi>Tradewel</hi> ſeeing his man in ſo great a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, could not but ſmile to himſelf, asking him what was the matter? O Sir, ſaid he, your low trembling voice from without, and your frightful appearance within hath ſo diſordered
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:57215:72"/>me with fear, that I am like one beſides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Although <hi>Tradewel</hi> was in his ſhirt half ſtarv'd with cold could not forbear laughing, nor would he loſe the pleaſure of diſcourſing with his man at preſent, although he was ſure his body would ſuffer for it by ſome diſtemper hereafter. Come Sirrah, ſaid he, theſe pretences ſhall not ſerve your turn, I know your diſſimulation, and your ſubtle pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, I know what contract you made with my maid, how, and when you were to meet, though you diſappointed her, but that was, becauſe you were afraid of my detecting your Roguery, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this night I watcht your appointment to prevent further miſchief.</p>
                     <p>The Caſhier was all wonder and amazement; he could not imagine who ſhould diſcover his dark deſigns, unleſs the Devil had don't by declaring himſelf his profeſt Enemy: it was but a folly to ſuſpect one or the other, or to blame any; it was now only expedient to make confeſſion and ask forgiveneſs, which as ſoon as he had done, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter granted him his requeſt, with this <hi>Proviſo,</hi> he ſhould never attempt the like again. But hold, ſaid <hi>Tradewel,</hi> there is ſomething more to be ſaid and done, and that is help me to one of your clean ſhirts, and whatever you think, ſpeak not a word, as you tender your own welfare; let it ſuffice, that I tell you thus much, that I have been upon other Diſcoveries this night than barely your laſcivious appointment, but what they are, they muſt be ſecret to you.</p>
                     <p>The Caſhier got him preſently a clean ſhirt, the ſooner to be rid of his Company, which as ſoon as <hi>Tradewel</hi> had put on, he return'd to his own Chamber, lying down by his Wives ſide, with
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:57215:72"/>as little noiſe as the gliding of a Snake over a ſmooth Marble; ſhe was in a profound ſleep, as one extremely tired, making it appear by her (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual) ſnoring, the pleaſure ſhe took in ſleeping, and that ſhe had travell'd that night every whit as far as her Husband. Yet though <hi>Tradewel</hi> was as cautious as might be of awakening her, yet he could not avoid the tumbling of her legs to and fro, agitated by ſome pleaſant fancies in her dream, which falling on his (as cold, as if they had been pickled in ſnow, and laid on the <hi>Alps</hi> a whole Winter) made her ſuddenly ſtart out of her ſleep, no leſs tormented with that extreme cold, than others with the contrary Element; <hi>Tradewel</hi> ſhrunk from her, and ſhe purſued him, laying her hands on his face, breaſt, and thighs, and diſſembling her knowledge of his abſence: My Dear, ſaid ſhe, what means this ſtrange and unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual coldneſs? Art well? Prethee ſtrike a light, I am confident that ſomething is amiſs; to which he replied, that he was in good health, and that his coldneſs proceeded from the bed-cloaths tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling off. That cannot be, ſaid ſhe, the Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaffs would hinder any ſuch thing; and then lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her hands all about him, ſaid ſhe, is it poſſible you can be ſo univerſally cold, and in a warm bed with a warmer Bed-fellow, come abſcond the truth no longer, and what e're it be, diſcover it, and I will not be offended. If then you'l know the truth, Sweet-heart, ſaid he, I have of of late ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected ſome irregular practices between my Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhier and my maid <hi>Suſan,</hi> and this night I was reſolved to try whether I could detect them; to which ſhe ſuddenly and ſmartly replied, <hi>I now muſt detect you: Is it not ſufficient that you have a wife not loaded with years, her face not deform'd, her body
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:57215:73"/>fruitful, and her heart faithful, but that you muſt intrench on other mens proprieties? Surely Mr.</hi> Sale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware <hi>and you becoming Copartners, it was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended you ſhould go Partner in his Wives Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities: Could any man in the world prove ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful to two at once, one that he ſhould love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the world, a wife, the other which he ſhould affect the next thereto, a Friend? Would you be ſerv'd ſo your ſelf?</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Tradewel</hi> had not a word to ſay in his own vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication, but pleaded guilty to all that was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd againſt him, earneſtly beſeeching his Wife ſhe would paſs all by, and he would never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the like again; upon that condition ſhe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gave him, and the ſooner, as knowing ſhe was no loſer by his infidelity.</p>
                     <p>The morning approaching, Mr. <hi>Saleware</hi> came and careſſed his Partner, thanking him for the tender care he had of his Wife in his abſence, and that they both were much obliged to him for his love; Complements paſt on all ſides, and a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſeeming ſatisfaction did o'reſpread the faces of them all, and now every one betook himſelf to his proper buſineſs: Only <hi>Suſan</hi> could do no bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs at all, becauſe her buſineſs was not done; ſhe could not reſt ſatisfied till ſhe had ſingled out her falſe Lover; and therefore quickly found an opportunity, ſhe firſt acquainted him with the greatneſs of her love, and how it was abuſed by him; and to be ſhort, if he would not tell her the whole truth of the occaſion of this breach of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, ſhe would never indure him more. The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhier hearing this ſad ſentence, if he were not real in his Relation, and being re-inflam'd again with thoſe adored eyes of hers, and her inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting pleaſing language (forgetting his Miſtreſſes
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:57215:73"/>threats) he tels her the naked truth, informing her, that as he was coming with no other intent than to fulfil his promiſe to her, by a miſtake en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring the wrong Chamber, he paid her due Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to her Miſtreſs, who was left alone by her ungrateful Husband, who was gone to enjoy Mrs. <hi>Saleware</hi> in the abſence of her Husband, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters Partner.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Suſan</hi> was ready to ſink down to hear that in all probability ſhe had utterly loſt her Sweet-heart, knowing like a cunning Baggage, that now adays love is leſs prevalent than intereſt: but prethee ſaid ſhe, How did ſhe receive thee? At firſt, ſhe thought me to be her Husband, till ſhe perceived how many Barrs I had out-thrown him, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her miſtake, ſhe ſeem'd like a woman diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, complaining that her hitherto untaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Chaſtity was ruin'd, that I was a Villain, for being the Murderer thereof, and that ſhe wondred with what impudence I durſt approach her bed; I was forc't at length to vindicate my ſelf from that bold attempt, to tell her what love I had for you, for the acccompliſhment of which we had appointed that night to receive the pawn on each ſide of each others fidelity. And you have then, ſaid ſhe, diſcovered me to be the wonton ſubject of her cenſure and reproach: no matter, ſaid he. When ſhe underſtood that what was committed was by miſtake, ſhe ſeem'd ſatisſi'd, and was thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to Heaven that this miſtake had reveng'd her Husbands infidelity; then ſhe charg'd me to be ſecret and be gone, and as a reward gave me this Ring; before I took my leave I enjoyn'd her to the ſame ſecrecie of our Amour. In the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that this is a truth, I do forgive what's paſt, conditionally you ne'r enjoy your Miſtreſs more.</p>
                     <pb n="138" facs="tcp:57215:74"/>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Tradewel</hi> carried himſelf now very obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gingly to his Wife, and indifferently to his female Friend, and more than uſual friendly to her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, but continually quarrelling with his Maid <hi>Suſan,</hi> to the intent that he might make her wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his Service, and ſo be gone; ſhe perceiving this, was reſolv'd ſpeedily to make Hay whileſt the Sun ſhin'd, and knew no better way to bring about her ends, then to carry her ſelf moſt charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly affectionate to her Friend, the Caſhier, and to grant him every thing he deſir'd; when he pleas'd he had the Command of her Bed, and dalliances with her where he pleas'd, and as often as he liſted, and being now ſolely Regent over his affections (although now and then he accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied his Miſtreſs (more to pleaſe her than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf) ſhe reſolved by his overthrow to raiſe her ſelf; and thus ſhe plotted it: Notwithſtanding the frowardneſs of he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:57215:74"/>how inconſiderately his Wives love is miſpla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced on her Servant.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Tradewel</hi> heard this with no ſmall pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of minde, however being willing to know the truth hereof, he promiſed her a reward if ſhe would make him a ſpeedy diſcovery thereof. In the proſecution whereof, one night when <hi>Suſan</hi> had got the Caſhier in bed with her, and having according to cuſtome after tiring been uſed to ſleep with her an hour or two (ſhe being all this while his waking Centinel to raiſe him when it was time to return to his own bed) I ſay, ſhe then took the opportunity of conveying two Keys out of his Pocket, the one of his Till, where his Maſters Caſh lay, the other of his Trunck, which contain'd his wearing Apparel, with other things properly belonging; She opens his Trunk firſt, by the help of a Candle ſhe had placed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath her bed in a dark Lanthorn, and there finds the chiefeſt thing ſhe lookt for, the Ring which his Miſtreſs had given him as a pledge of her love, ſhe found what ſhe lookt for, and therefore lockt the Trunck again, without diminiſhing any thing therein contain'd, but the Ring. After this ſhe trips down the ſtairs ſoftly into the ſhop, and opening the Till, took out one hundred Guinny's, which was in a ſmall bag by its ſelf, and one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pound bag of ſilver, locking the Till again, which money ſhe hid in the Cellar, and ſo went up again to her own Chamber, putting the Keys into his Pocket, he not miſſing her all this while, being faſt aſleep. All things being effected with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt remaining ſuſpition, ſhe awak't her Lover, telling him ſhe had over-indulg'd his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour in letting him ſleep ſo long, however ſhe was well content to have no reſt (and enjoy his
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:57215:75"/>Company) ſo that he might have it; and ſo with a hug and a buſs they parted.</p>
                     <p>In the morning early ſhe got up, and taking the money ſhe had hid (with an excuſe of going but half a dozen doors off) ſhe carried it off, and put it into the hands of a very truſty Friend of hers, and making very little ſtay, returns home.</p>
                     <p>By this time her Maſter was up, who found her as formerly, very diligent in the Kitching, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alone, ask'd her, what further progreſs ſhe had made in the diſcovery; I will tell you, ſaid ſhe, within an hour, if you will be ſure to ſtep out and be in again; in the mean time I will ſhew you a Ring, which your Wife gave her man; which by his knowledge thereof, increaſt his jealouſie. He conſented thereto, and ſhe in the mean time ſteps up to her Miſtreſs to know what ſhe would be pleas'd to have for dinner: Ask your Maſter ſaid her Miſtreſs, forſooth, ſaid ſhe, he is gone (he told me as far as <hi>Blackwal,</hi> and it is queſtionable whether he can come to dinner. <hi>Blackwal,</hi> how can that be! ſend up the Caſhier to me, he will give me better information where he is gone than you can; I will riſe by and by, in the mean time I'le think what to have for Dinner.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Suſan</hi> was over-joy'd her plot took ſo well, and indeed but according to her expectation; for ſhe obſerv'd her Miſtreſs always inquire where her Husband was, if gone out, how far, and then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the diſtance of place ſhe knew how to imploy her time and exerciſe her ſelf with her man. Coming down ſhe did not go immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to acquaint the Caſhier with his Miſtreſſes Command, but ſtaid ſome time ere ſhe told him, extracting from him at the ſame time Proteſtations of Conſtancie.</p>

                     <p>Up he goes to his Miſtreſs, but he had not been there long, e're <hi>Tradewel</hi> came in, &amp; being inform'd by <hi>Suſan</hi> how affairs ſtood, he went ſoftly up the ſtairs, and thruſting at his Chamber-door, he found it lockt; he knockt again and again, but no anſwer; till at laſt he ſpoke aloud, Open the Door, and that quickly too, or I'le force it open: Whereupon ſhe came to the Door in her Smock, and did let him in; ſhe needed not to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt what ſhe had bad been doing, the diſorder ſhe was in, proclaim'd more than her tongue could utter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Tradewel</hi> in a rage askt her where her Minion was; ſhe was ſo amaz'd, ſhe could not pronounce one ſillable; hurried on with impatience, he ſearcht the room round, but found no body, till he lookt underneath the bed (the Mother would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have lookt for her Daughter in the Oven, but that ſhe had been there her ſelf) and there he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpied his truſty Squire, having not room enough to kneel for pardon; as he was about to drag him out, his wife that had recalled her wandring ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, took heart-a-grace, and ſtaying her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band by the ſleeve, ſaid, I pray Sir, be not too raſh, conſider it was your own caſe once, and were you not glad by the ſubtlety of a woman to eſcape that eminent danger which hung over your head, pray Sir, let this Patern or reſemblance of your late Condition intercede for him; your Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie availed you little in that ſtreight, neither will his in this exigencie; you were preſerv'd by your Miſtreſſes wit and ſubtlety, he is undone by my indiſcretion and folly, if you applaud the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer commiſerate the later.</p>
                     <p>Theſe melting, yet biting expreſſions took <hi>Trade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi> off from the height of fury, ſo that his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:57215:76"/>knew not how to terminate any otherwiſe than inſtantly to call his Caſhier to an account about the Caſh committed into his charge; and therefore charg'd him to be gone immediately to that intent and purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>The Caſhier who was never call'd to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count before, by reaſon of the large ſecurity his Parents gave his Maſter for his fidelity, which gave the greater liberty to his credulity, in aſſiſting his Brethren who had ran out of Caſh, and being conſcious how far he had ran out himſelf, it ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him almoſt as much as this unexpected ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize; as he was going down the ſtairs a ſudden reſolution krept into his head to clear his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts and free himſelf from the approaching dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, he could not but in reaſon expect would ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly fall upon him, by one ſingle act, and that was forthwith to acquit his Maſters houſe, and throw himſelf upon the guidance of Fortune, which accordingly he put in execution; for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately he got himſelf out of the doors with as much haſt and fear, as one that had made his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape from a common confinement or his Keeper; not carrying any thing more than what he had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him.</p>
                     <p>The News was ſoon brought to his Maſter Mr. <hi>Tradewel,</hi> who was not a jot troubled thereat, but rather rejoyc't that he was rid of a ſharer in his Marriage-rights, knowing withal how to give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſatisfaction for what his Servant had ran out.</p>
                     <p>This coming to the ears of <hi>Suſan,</hi> made her tranſported with joy, how fully her revenge was extended, and how well paid ſhe was for the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution thereof, being confident her Cheat could never in all probability be found out; beſides her Maſter to reward her Treachery, vail'd with the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:57215:76"/>pretence of fidelity gave her fifty pieces, with a promiſe ſhe might continue as long as ſhe pleas'd in hi, houſe, with an augmentation of her Wages; ſhe thankt him, and gave him only the hearing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to ſtay no longer than ſhe might make ſome conſiderable purchaſe, and ſo march off.</p>
                     <p>In purſuance whereof, ſhe ſingled out Mrs. <hi>Saleware</hi> at a convenient time, and diſcovered to her the knowledge of all thoſe amorous Intrigues which paſt between her and her Maſter, inſtancing every remarkable particular, and laying it ſo home, that Mrs. <hi>Saleware</hi> could not but acknowledge them all truths by her ſilence; having wrought her Plot ſo far, ſhe reſolv'd to drive the nail home to the head for what it was deſigned for, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore told her, that the ruine of her credit lay at her diſpoſal, but for her part ſhe was ſo tender of the Reputation of her Sex, that ſhe ſcorn'd to be a Traytor to its infirmities.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. <hi>Saleware</hi> that was apprehenſive enough, and knew very well by the method of her diſcourſe what ſhe aim'd at; rold her, ſhe lookt upon her more diſcreet than to make ſo great a diſtraction in a Family ſhe belong'd to, by ſpeaking of ſuch things, which if known, the differences that would thence ariſe would never be reconcil'd; however ſaid ſhe, to ſeal your everlaſting ſilence, accept theſe Guinneys, and my everlaſting friendſhip, if not murder'd by your falſhood, and ſo leaves her.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Suſan</hi> carries this parcel to her former hoard of money, and not ſatisfied yet, was reſolved to caſt her net for more before ſhe left fiſhing in this Pool. She now goes to her Miſtreſs, and with tears (which ſhe had always at Command) makes a ſad Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint for the loſs of her Love, telling her, that he
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:57215:77"/>was betroath't to her, and had it not been for her diſloyalty to her Husband, ſhe might have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd him ſtill; but now he was paſt recovery, and though ſhe had underſtood all thoſe amorous En<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tertainments from his own mouth which were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd between them, yet ſhe rather chooſe to ſuffer in his love, than ſtain the credit of her loving Miſtreſs; that all ſhe required at preſent only was, that ſhe would be pleas'd to revenge her on that diſhoneſt, faithleſs, and laſcivious woman, Mrs. <hi>Saleware,</hi> who was the ſource and original of all her troubles, for had ſhe not (ſaid ſhe) conſented to the loſe embraces of your Husband, my Maſter, your Servant and my Husband that ſhould be by a miſtake in his abſence, could never have obtain'd the opportunity of enjoying you by breaking his faith with me.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. <hi>Tradewel</hi> heard theſe Complaints with no ſmall confuſion and trouble of mind, but however to gratifie her own as well as her Servants re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, ſhe conſented to do herein what ſhe would adviſe her to. All that I requeſt you to do, ſaid <hi>Suſan,</hi> is to acquaint her Husband how baſely your Husband hath abuſed his Bed, but make him ſwear he will not diſcover one tittle you do relate to him; aggravate every circumſtance in ſuch manner, that you may make his jealouſie ſwell beyond all ſenſe and reaſon. This will put him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſtrange extravagant abuſes at firſt, each of which will be a tickling pleaſure to ſee them exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, and this in a little time alſo will be the means to rid your ſelf of a Rival lodg'd within the bowels of all your concerns.</p>
                     <p>This advice was ſo well liked of by Mrs. <hi>Tradewel,</hi> that ſhe could not reſt till ſhe had acquainted Mr. <hi>Saleware</hi> with this ſecret, which in effect was
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:57215:77"/>none at all, being known to more than two. Mr. <hi>Saleware</hi> when he heard it was ready to run di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted, and could hardly be perſwaded but that he would either lay violently hands on himſelf or Wife immediately; but being qualified by his own reaſon, and ſuch as Mrs. <hi>Tradewel</hi> produced, he deferr'd his revenge till another time <hi>Suſan</hi> thinking ſhe had done as mueh miſchief as ſhe could, reſolv'd to be packing, and therein follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the example of the Rats (according to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port) which will fly from a falling houſe: She took her opportunity, and getting together ſome of her Miſtreſſes choice implements of gawdry, as a gold Watch, Pendents, Rings, a Neck-lace of Pearl, with other things of value, ſhe tript off unſuſpected, &amp; abſconded her ſelf for a while. Not long after Mr. <hi>Saleware</hi> confeſt a Judgment, or Warrant of Attorney to a ſpecial friend of his, for more by much than his own ſtock or Partners Mr. <hi>Tradewels</hi> would amount to; which was his firſt revenge on his diſloyal Friend, what reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing injuries he inflicted on his Wife, I cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, only you may imagine what an abuſed Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band will do in ſuch a caſe, when prompted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by jealouſie and Revenge.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Tradewel</hi> looking on kis Wife as the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this deſperate and irregular courſe, left her to the wide world, and went for <hi>Virginia,</hi> where he died, his wiſe in his abſence being expoſed to a great deal of miſery, what through want and grief, died not long after.</p>
                     <p>Thus you ſee how ſuddenly two flouriſhing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies were brought to ruine by exorbitant luſt and the ſubtilty of a revengeful woman; but this was but the beginning or infancie of her early Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, thouſands whereof in the progreſs of her
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:57215:78"/>life ſhe nommitted far more cotorious than any hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto related, I have not room to deſcribe them all, wherefore I ſhall briefly recount to you as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as I may.</p>
                     <p>After her running away from her Maſter, ſhe apparall'd her ſelf as richly and as modiſhly as moſt of the female Gallants about the Town, and went by the name of Mrs. <hi>Craftsby,</hi> ſhe took her lodging near to thoſe places where the Gentry moſt reſorted, where ſhe not only learn'd the counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit deportment of a Gentlewoman, but likewiſe by her Habit skrew'd her ſelf into the acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of ſuch of her Sex, as were placed in the Spheres of Honeſty and Honour.</p>
                     <p>She pretended her ſelf the Relict of a Knight in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> by which Lye ſhe obtain'd the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of being called Madam, and the advantage of being Courted by men of good Eſtates, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and ſo importunate, that her Lodgings from morning to night were ſeldom clear'd from one or more amorous viſitants; and although by the moſt fiery ſhe was hotly beſet, yet ſhe would not ſurrender; till fearing ſhe might withſtand her better fortunes, ſhe yielded to the importunities of a Gentleman well ſtricken in years, but one that had the beſt eſtate of all her Suiters. They were not long married, before the old Gentleman found her out what ſhe was, not only a Cheat, but an inſatiate Whore to boot, having now a Cloak for her unbridled Lechery; the knowledge whereof made a ſeparation between them; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhe ſued for Alimony, and forc't from him a competent maintenance; ſhe now no longer hid her ſelf under the vail of ſeeming Chaſtity, but walkt with Vice barefoot every where; and now for profit as much as pleaſure, ſhe proſtituted her
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:57215:78"/>ſelf to any thing that had money; nay, a Dog, if he had but a ſhilling in his mouth: By theſe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcivious exceſſes ſhe was ſo often clapt, that ſhe became a meer Hoſpital of Diſeaſes, and was now no longer in a Condition to maintain the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putution of a handſome Whore, being metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoſed into the likeneſs of a loathſome and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Bawd.</p>
                     <p>Yet ſtill ſhe had her Wits about her; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering ſhe could do nothing of her ſelf, unleſs ſhe procured ſome aſſiſtance of other; ſhe trotted all the Town over to find out one fit for her pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; Pat as ſhe would have it, going into a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning-houſe near <hi>Whetstones-Park,</hi> ſhe found a young Plyer there, whoſe Countenance promiſed every thing ſhe deſired, and having diſcourſt her, found her what ſhe ſeem'd to be, and her own Niece: whereupon promiſing her greater advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages than ſhe could reap there, ſhe allur'd her to her Houſe, where as Partners they liv'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>Her Name was Miſtreſs <hi>Wheedle,</hi> a plump ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culent Girl, with a face no way contemptible, ſhe had a quaint Wit, a charming Tongue, and an humour ſo brisk a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>In a little time ſhe was ſo generally known that ſhe was compell'd to ſtudy new Artifices to allure in Cuſtomers, and thoſe which ſhe refus'd at firſt, ſhe was now glad to acept of, ſo that the houſe became the receptable of all forts of Cullies; not only the Bleeding-Cully, but the Ruff-Cully, the Dark-Cully, the Flogging-Cully, and the Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing-Cully; in ſhort, no perſons how wicked ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver (Whores, Rogues, Pads, Gilts, Files) but were her daily Companions.</p>
                     <p>This houſe at length grew ſo notoriouſly infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, that it was known and pointed at almoſt by every Boy which paſt that way. Hereupon the Juſtice takes Mrs. <hi>Craftsby</hi> the Bawd, to a ſevere account, and upon examination found her ſo guilty (not only for Bawdry, but all manner of Roguery, frequently entertaining ſuch in her houſe, who being detected there, were afterwards hang'd) I ſay, for theſe conſiderations, the Juſtice made her <hi>Mittimus</hi> and ſent her to Priſon; Mrs. <hi>Wheedle</hi> having had timely notice hereof, made her eſcape, and ſoon after the commitment of her Partner, ſold all ſhe had, and not contented with this, ſhe turn'd Night-Walker, whileſt in the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time ſhe exerciſed other Profeſſions belonging to the ancient Society of <hi>Tyburn:</hi> Sometimes ſhe plaid the part of a File, and did it with dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity, even to admiration; ſhe was a cleanly conveying Shop-lift, having a very large Pocket or Wallet underneath her under Petticoat, in which ſhe would, cheapning Commodities in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Shops convey inſenſibly ſomething of every
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:57215:79"/>thing; but at laſt endeavouring to play the Girl in a Tavern with one of her Bully-Huffs, they were both diſcovered in the act, carried before a Juſtice, and by him ſent to <hi>Newgate;</hi> at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing Seſſions, Mrs. <hi>Craftsby</hi> the Bawd received the Sentence of Carting, Mrs. <hi>Wheedle</hi> and her Gallant, of being carted to <hi>Tyburn,</hi> where they ended their wretched lives, whileſt the other li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved more hated than the laſt were pitied.</p>
                     <p>By this Story (which is a very truth) you may ſee the evil Conſequences which heavily wait on Luſt and ſuch exorbitant actions; and therefore my advice is to all, that they imitate the Aegyptian <hi>Niceta,</hi> by ſayling by the <hi>Scylla</hi> of carnal pleaſure, and the <hi>Caribdis</hi> of incontinencie; and yet not endanger the Shipwrack of their Chaſtity; and I could with I knew how to teach you to drink out of <hi>Circes</hi> Cup, and not be converted into Swine; &amp; how you may hear the <hi>Syrens</hi> ſweet &amp; charming voices, and not yet be not inchanted by them.
