            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

coruption that lyeth lurking in the
heart of man. Now for the soul to feele
such a change, such a regeneration
wrought on the heart, after a true and
serious repentance, and the embrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of a Saviour, the Lord Jesus in his
arms ready to receive thee; what a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent
unspeakable comfort is that soul
partaker of!</p>
               <p>But that we may not flatter our selves
with the bare flashes, and as it were,
shaddows of comfort, taken from a
wrong principle, let us consider, and that
seriously, from whence our comforts do
arise: Do they arise from an utter ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horring
our selves by reason of our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
by nature? For until we be
wounded, what need can we find of a
medicine? Until we can find our selves
heart-sick of sin, what need can we find
to our selves of a Physician? <hi>They that
are whole need not a Physician, but they
that are sick.</hi> Is Jesus Christ the chief
desire of thy soul? Art thou willing to
part with any thing for him, that having
found this treasure, canst thou presently
hide it in thy heart? Art thou willing
to sell all that thou hast to purchase this
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:109059:11"/>
Field, this Treasure, this Wisdom? Is
thy heart affected with the saving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Jesus Christ? Dost thou eye
Jesus Christ by faith? Dost thou see ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of satisfaction in the merits, death,
and passion of Christ? Dost thou feel
by the power of Christ's spirit an appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of all this to thy soul, that thou
canst out of a setled assurance conclude
these benefits and blessings belong to
me?</p>
               <p>Then my soul, let thy temporal condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
be what it will, as for this life, yet
raise up thy affections higher; let thy
heart be where thy treasure is, repose
thy self upon Jesus, and take care of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empting
thy self from those heavenly
priviledges which the blood of Jesus
Christ is ready to pour down upon thee.</p>
               <p>These things well considered, are as
so many sinews and joynts to strengthen
a weak and drooping faith; the Lord
give me his spirit of grace, that I may
not only write these Truths, but that
by his strength they may be applied un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
my soul.</p>

            <head>Certain Propositions which (in
my Meditations) I have collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
together (in this time which
is lent me) out of the 14 chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Hosea, and the first verse.</head>
            <head type="sub">The words are these,
Oh Israel, Return unto the Lord thy
God, for thou hast faln by thine
Iniquity.</head>
            <p>THe words are an exhortation, or a
vehement perswasion (which the
Spirit of God doth use by the Prophet)
to return to God. The whole chapter
containing a rousing or stirring up the
people of Israel to repent of their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries,
and to return to God; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
are annexed gracious promises of
Gods mercies unto them, in healing their
backslidings, and returning unto them:
and you may observe what a mixture of
repentance and mercy there is in the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:109059:13"/>
chapter: From whence in the general,
we may observe the unseparableness of
true repentance and mercy; they are
linked together as in a chain, even as
<hi>David</hi> and <hi>Ionathan,</hi> they will not
part one from the other.</p>
            <p>In the words there are five particulars
observed:</p>
            <p>1. The seriousness of the Prophet's
call, perswading our better attention, and
as it were a necessity of lending an ear
unto this Call, in the Vocative, O!</p>
            <p>2. The persons called, <hi>Israel:</hi> By
Israel is meant the people of God.</p>
            <p>3. The Act or Duty called unto;
<hi>Return.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. The object matter of their return,
or the person to whom they should, is,
<hi>the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. and lastly, The grounds and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of this their return, laid down in
cloze of the words; <hi>For thou hast fallen
by thine iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the words you may plainly ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
several points or observations, to wit;</p>
            <p>1. That the best and choisest of God's
children may decline, and grievously fall
from God, as Israel did.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:109059:14"/>
2. That the ways of sin lead us di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
from God. <hi>Or thus,</hi> That sin is an
absolute turning the Back upon God;
therefore Return.</p>
            <p>3. That God the Father, through his
Son the Lord Iesus Christ, is the only
shelter and tower of refuge for a penitent
sinner. <hi>Thy God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4 <hi>And lastly,</hi> That it is and ought
to be the main scope and aim of the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors
and Ministers of Iesus Christ,
to disswade from sin, and perswade to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
            <p>O Israel, Return unto the Lord thy
God; for thou hast fallen by thine
iniquities.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First, of the first in order,</hi> That the
best and choisest of God's Saints and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
may grievously decline and fall from
God.</p>
            <p>For proof whereof, I need go no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then the subject we treat of, <hi>Israel;</hi>
a name whereby God pleased to stile his
own people, his elect, his chosen people
of Israel;<note place="margin">Hos: 4. 6.</note> my people, as he terms them.
Nay God is pleased to term himself <hi>The
King of Israel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Esai. 44. 1.</note> in <hi>Isa. 44. 6. Thus saith
the Lord of Hosts, the King of Israel,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:109059:14"/>
and his Redeemer, the Lord of Hosts:</hi>
We know the prerogative of Kings is to
rule over their Subjects, to have the
command and government of their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and we know what the duty of
Subjects ought to be in yeilding obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to the commands of a King, and
not to rule over their King; yet this
revolting people Israel, this rebellious
House, for so God calls them, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
his owning them for his people,
and challenging a Soveraignty over
them, grievously sinned, and fell from
God; For, <hi>thou hast fallen by thine
Iniquity.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Esa: 59: 2.</note> 
               <hi>Your iniquities have separated
between you and your God, and your sins
have hid his face from you, that he will
not hear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So to instance in divers other of the
saints and people of God.</p>

            <p>But what are the grounds and reasons

iniquities?</p>
            <p>First, The principal and main ground

in the world, to beware of sin, and
to shun it as the greatest evil in the world,

and likewise to consider the dangerous

the word,<note place="margin">Doct.</note> and laid open more abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the Ministery of the Gospel, should
be a strong perswasion unto us to walk
according to the rules of the Gospel.</p>
            <p>Or thus,</p>
            <p>That Christs exceeding love unto us,
in redeeming us from death and hell,
should be a strong ty upon us to love
Jesus Christ. Every one that hears me,
cannot deny but must needs confess and
acknowledge that the point is very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,
and (I may say) very seasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in these apostatizing dayes of ours;
that Love deserves Love. Our Saviour
speaks of a deserved love as a thing not
to be looked on, not worth any reward:
<hi>For if ye love them that love you,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 46.</note> 
               <hi>what
thanks have ye?</hi> saith our Saviour, <hi>Do
not even the Publicans the same?</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noting
unto us, that true love is of such
an extensive nature that it sheweth it
self even to our enemies: this is perfect
and true love:<note place="margin">Vers. 48,</note> 
               <hi>Be ye therefore perfect,
even as<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> your Father which is in Heaven
is perfect.</hi> Now the greatness of Jesus
Christs love is shewn in that he loved us
when we were enemies unto him, stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
and aliens from the common wealth
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:109059:21"/>
of Israel. And how did Christ love us?
was his love an ordinary love? That
Christ the Son of God, co-equal with
his Father, should become man; even
the meanest of men (although by <hi>Ioseph</hi>
he was next heir to the Crown of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
yet he came in the very declining
age of <hi>Davids</hi> Kingdom, to shew us that
his Kingdom is not of this World, as
he tells us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 8. 25.</note> 
               <hi>My kingdom is not of this
World,)</hi> and should suffer a cursed
death on the Crosse, for our sins, that
we might be delivered from eternal mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery,
and from his Fathers wrath, and
overcome death for us: Will not these
considerations work our hard hearts to
an humble frame, and perswade us to
love God and our Lord Jesus Christ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain?
Is not the love of Christ to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed
by us? in that he being the Son
of God, humbled himself, to become a
servant to men, to make us Sons and

upon strange and uncouth sights, to run
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:109059:21"/>
to see things that are rare<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and are seldom
seen; therefore now let me quicken
your desire, to behold a thing without
comparison, such a thing as we may
with a kind of astonishment and ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zedness
admire, but the eloquence of no
man alive is able fully and effectually to
express:<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 3. 1</note> 
               <hi>Behold,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>what
love the Father hath shewn unto us, that
we should be called the Sons of God.
Behold, the Son of God made man, to dy
for us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 4. 5.</note> 
               <hi>that we might be delivered from
the slavery of Satan, and be made the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted
sons of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might insist upon this point not out
of any hope I have to set out a benefit so
inestimable: for the tongue of men and
Angels cannot reach it: but as it were (as
God said to <hi>Moses)</hi> to let you see the
back parts of that perfect glory,<note place="margin">Exod. 33. 23.</note> which
the dimness of our minds is not able to
behold.</p>
            <p>Now that we may be the better sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of Christs love, let us consider how
and in what manner the Lord Jesus
Christ is pleased to reveal himself unto
us in the Gospel: and that in three par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:109059:22"/>
First, He uncovers and layeth open
himself fully and manifestly in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel:
we have a whole Christ offered
unto us; we have his offices, and the
whole work of our redemption set
down:<note place="margin">Ioh. 5. 39.</note> 
               <hi>Search the Scriptures, for they
are they that testifie of me,</hi> saith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.
We do in the Word of God as
in a glasse, behold the proportion of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, when we compare the Old
and New Testament together; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it concerns us, and it is most need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and necessary in this great work of
our salvation (so that our faith may be
the better grounded and confirmed) to
note and observe the order and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Scriptures, both Old and
New Testament: by this mens Christ
himself endeavoured to settle his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
Faith: for the Text tells us that he
began at <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets, and
interpretted to them in all the Scriptures
the things which were written of him.<note place="margin">Luk 24. 27.</note>
            </p>
            <p>We live in an age that men are so
backward in following Christs pattern
herein, that they are grown contemners
and dispisers of the word of God, which
plainly appears in that they divide the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:109059:22"/>
New Testament from the Old, making
a separation of that which God hath
joyned together: they will (it may be)
carry the New Testament in their poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets,
I and in their pates too, yet sure I
am it cannot be near their hearts, when
they shall think themselves too wise to
read the Old, or give entertainment to it
upon which the Patriarchs and our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers
of old built their Faith, and by
the light of which they found the way
to heaven.</p>
            <p>This was <hi>Pauls</hi> course for the estab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishment
of his hearers, he disputed by
the Scriptures;<note place="margin">Act. 17. 2</note> he said no other things
then that <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets did
say should come:<note place="margin">Act. 26. 22.</note> These and the like
sayings we read often that the <hi>sayings of
the Prophets should be fullfilled;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 26. 56.</note> This
is done that the Scriptures should be
fullfilled:<note place="margin">Mark. 14. 49.</note> which argues the care and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the Spirit of <hi>God</hi> had to ground
our Judgement upon the Scriptures, in
so much that when we clearly behold
those things fullfilled which are recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in them, we should set the higher
esteem on them; comfort our selves in
them, and strengthen our Faith by them
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:109059:23"/>
Take now a view of Christ in the
Scriptures, and see first how he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
in <hi>Zacharïas</hi> prophecy; <hi>Blessed
be the Lord God of Israel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 1. 67, 68, 69.</note> 
               <hi>who hath visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and redeemed his people:</hi> There you
have Christ termed the horn of our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
a Metaphor taken from beasts,
wherein doth ly their chief strenght and
power, giving us to understand that our
saviour Iesus Christ is of full and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
sufficiency to accomplish the work
of our redemption; for <hi>there is no other
Name under heaven by which we can be
saved;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 4. 12</note> But only in and through the
Name and merrits of the Lord Iesus
Christ.<note place="margin">Co. 1. 19.</note>
            </p>
            <p>It hath pleased the Father that in
him all fullness should dwell: would
you see Christ promised? read the 28
of <hi>Esaiah 16. therefore thus saith the
Lord, Behold, I lay in Syon for a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
a stone, a tryed stone, a precious
Corner stone, a sure foundation. Psal.
118. 22. Matth. 21. 42. Acts 4. 11.
1 Pet. 5. 6, 7. Esai.</hi> 11. 1. Would ye
behold Christs Nativity? read <hi>Luke 2.
7. 10, 11, 12. Iohn 7. 42. Mich</hi> 5. 2.
Would you behold his Passion? <hi>Esaiah</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:109059:23"/>
53, 7, 8, 9. Mat. 27, 35. would you see
him Dead and Buried? read: Mat. 27.
50. 60. would you see his Resurrection?
read the 28. Math. 6. Iohn 20. 2. 15.
19. 26. Would you see his Assention?
read Acts 1. 9. Would you see him at
the Right hand of his Father in heaven?
read Hebrews 1. 3. Would you see
him coming from heaven to Judge the
quick and the dead? read Matthew 25.
31. Thus you see in the first place how
fully the Lord Iesus Christ is set forth
unto us in his word, in himself, which is
the Word.<note place="margin">Ioh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. 1, 2.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Christ doth very friendly
perswade us to imbrace him in the
Scriptures, and that upon very good
grounds and reasons: First, because he
came purposely into the world to save
us,<note place="margin">Mat. 19. 13.</note> 
               <hi>he was wounded for our transgressions,
and broken for our iniquities, and with
his stripes we are healed.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 53. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Come unto me
all ye that are weary and heavy laden,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 11. 28.</note>
               <hi>and I will give you rest. Behold I stand
at the door and knock,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 3. 20</note> saith Christ, he
hath redeemed us from the curse of the
law,<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 13</note> Beeing made a curse for us. <hi>Oh
every one that thirsteth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 55. 1.</note> 
               <hi>come unto the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:109059:24"/>
waters, and he that hath no mony, come
buy, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Christ doth very friendly
perswades us to be reconciled unto him,
by his Ambassadors, which he sends a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us, the Ministers and dispencers
of his Word and Sacraments: the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of Christ,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 20.</note> they are the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
of Iesus Christ, which bring his
message unto his people; they do the
work which they are imployed in by
their Master; and Christ is pleased to set
men apart purposely for this service, as
S. <hi>Paul</hi> speakes. <hi>Paul an Apostle of
Iesus Christ,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 1.</note> 
               <hi>by the will of God &amp;c.</hi> and
as Christ doth set some apart for this
service, so he furnisheth them with gifts
suteable to the service: as for example,
<hi>Zacharias</hi> is apointed to prophesy; the
business is a weighty business, therefore
he is filled with the Holy Ghost,<note place="margin">Luk 1. 67</note> that he
may be able to performe that great
work.</p>
            <p>God imploys Moses upon a service of
great concernment; I will send thee to
<hi>Pharoah</hi> saith God:<note place="margin">Exod. 3. 10.</note> I my Lord? saith
<hi>Moses,</hi> I am not eloquent: the Lord pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently

No wise man will send a fool of

ever we had; doe not reject so great
salvation.</p>
            <p>Hath Jesus Christ purchased heaven
for Believers? doth he continually knock
at the door of our hearts for entrance,
and shall we not let him in? Shall we
still persist and go on in sin? in our drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness,
prophaness, contempt of Gods
word, of his Ministers? certainly if we
do, if we will take no warning, but go
on in the waies of the wicked, we shall
receive the reward of the wicked:<note place="margin">Prov. 22 8.</note> eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

go on and see to your steps, let the word

            <p>GEntlemen and Friends, I am yet a
living object of your pitty, ere long
my soul will be seperated from my body
by an untimely, yet a wel-deserved death.
Bloud must be recompenced with blood,
the Law of God commands it: the law
of Man in subordination to Gods Law,
hath brought me to the period of execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>But that I may not minde my Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rism,
so as to swallow it down without
chewing, give me leave to lay open the
heart of the fact, with the chief incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaries
thereupon attending, and that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in two particulars. First, laying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you the person on whom I acted it,
and the sudden deprivation of life in the
action. The person upon whom I acted
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:109059:28"/>
this bloody tragedy, it was not a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
but an acquaintance and friend, not
a common acquaintance or friend, but
a sister, an only sister, by flesh and blood;
and I can shew no reason could incite
me to it, except it were for her over
tender care and respect to me had, of
which I am now truly sensible: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
perswasions were nothing else but
the jugglings and delusions of that old
enemy of mankind Satan, who <hi>hath
been a lyar from the beginning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second Scene in this cruell and
bloody Tragedy, which much aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates
the fact, was the suddenness of the
action, which robbed her of her life in
a moment, without giving her any war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to prepare for heaven, so that as
much as in me lay, I did deprive her
temporal and eternal happiness, without
Gods great mercy. I might blaze this
my cruelty with several other colours,
but let these suffice to let you know the
horridness of the crime.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, you know how for a long
time my conversation amongst you hath
been very inconsistent to the gospel of
Jesus Christ; I have plaied the Atheist
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:109059:28"/>
in my practice, though not in my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession;
I have acknowledged there is a
God, but in my works I have denyed
him; and Atheism in practise is the
worst sort of Atheism, I have been in
the highest nature, a rebel, a traytor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the King of Kings, endeavouring
to unthrone God by not yeilding obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to his commands, and he that
plucks the King out of his throne is as
bad or worse, than he that saith there is
no King.</p>
            <p>Now that you may be the better sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seable
how I have idolized my professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
I will give you the Catalogue of sins
which our Saviour gives you in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
of <hi>Mark,</hi> the 21, 22, 23. verses,
for from within out of the heart of man
proceeds evil thoughts, adulteries,
fornications, murthers, thefts, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness,
wickedness, deceit, lascivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
an evil eye, blasphemies, pride,
foolishness: all these sins, have lain lur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
and been rooted in my heart ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally,
(being by nature the child of
wrath) and have in some kinde or other
been put in execution, though not in the
same manner literally, as they lye in the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:109059:29"/>
text, yet circumstantially as they may be
considered and applyed. But one main
sin which is not here rehearsed, hath
been my mother sin, to wit, drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and excess, the abuse of Gods crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
this hath been the engine of this
cruelty, and the door and inlet to all my
misery. Beware of this Lion-like sin,
least it command you to do the same
cruelty, give not the least entertainment
to it, as a cup and away; for it is the
greatest peece of witchcraft, that I know
to betray the soul to the Devil. Thus I
have given you a glimpse of my wounds,
now let me shew you my Physitian.</p>
            <p>But Gentlemen, I must not forget one
sin which was almost slipt out of my
memory,<note place="margin">This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted but really de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered.</note> namely, the sin of uncleanness,
I do not mean with a woman; Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
there is other uncleanness than that
with a woman, and there be some young
Gentlemen in company, that looks upon
me, which are guilty of the same, and
know what I mean.</p>
            <p>Then stooping to Mr. <hi>Rosewell</hi> he
began upon the breach of Sabbath, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, I have lived a long time
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:109059:29"/>
amongst you, and indeed frequented the
Church, but in all my time never kept
one sabbath to the Lord aright, as I
ought to do, I beseech you Gentlemen
to have a special care of keeping the
Sabbath, and slight not the Ministers of
God, who are his Embassadours: and
truly I see apparently an imminent judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
hanging over the head of this
Nation, upon the account of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
disagreeing; for well may the sheep
be scattered, and the flock come to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
when the Shepherds quarrel,
and go together by the ears.</p>
            <p>Well, but now to my Physitian.</p>
            <p>It hath pleased the Father that in
Jesus Christ all fulness should dwell, and
if all fulness, then the fulness of power,
to effect and bring to pass the work of
our redemption; he is the horn, the
strength of our salvation: Thus God
the Father from all eternity foreseeing
mans inability of standing, did provide
a remedy for his fall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Son of God,
the second person of the Trinity, to take
our nature upon him, and to dy a cursed
death on the cross, that we might live
eternally in heaven, and now he sits at

the right hand of God, making interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
for us, that by a lively faith joined
with contrition and mortification of the
old man and sin in us, can lay hold of
him, the right way to see the aboundant
mercy of God in Christ, is to see our
own misery by reason of sin, how lost
and undone we are without him.</p>
            <p>Behold what love the Father hath
shewed unto us that we should be called
the Sons of God. <hi>Seemeth it,</hi> saith
David, (being moved by the Courtiers
to entertain the offer of <hi>Sauls</hi> daughter)
<hi>a light thing to be the Kings Son in
law?</hi> and it is registred as a fruit of
<hi>Moses</hi> faith, to prefer the rebuke of
Christ before the title of the Sonne of
<hi>Pharaohs</hi> daughter: between God and
<hi>Saul</hi> what comparison? between the
King of heaven, and the Daughter of
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> what proportion? <hi>David</hi> might
have been Son in law to <hi>Saul,</hi> yet not
entituled to the Crown. <hi>Moses</hi> might
have been the adopted Son of <hi>Pharaohs</hi>
daughter, yet but a subject still. Seemeth
it a light matter to us to be called the
Sons of God, or to be the Sons of God,
which is all one: this Prerogative which

               <p>The occasion of my being limited up

               <p>It was I understand, his own request
(that it comeing often upon his
thoughts) it might be the remembrance
of him in his Funerall obsequies, and
might be to appeare in this confidence
upon the Churches hope, the Lord: <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
not O mine enemy.</hi> I shall make
no long surrows upon his back; it is
sufficient what hath been already done,
and now it is totally in vain for any as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
towards him, Except to rake up
the ashes of so great a crime: therefore

               <head type="sub">The text it self.</head>
               <p>Wherein Ile not trouble you with
dependance.</p>
               <p>The words are a distinct paragraphe
in themselves, and may be kept entire
within their own limits, bounds, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines:
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:109059:36"/>
so according to my old method of
for exposition of the text, take this.</p>
               <p>The sum.</p>
               <p>This is easily resolved in this issue.</p>
               <p>The sure stay, support and setleness
of the Church, and by consequence of

greatest declinings from God by

               <p>This being the sum of the whole text,
take the Analysis of the 8 verse, for that
is all: I can or will meddle with at this
time.</p>
               <p>1 The state of the Church and every

For the rest of the particulars my
time nor ability of body, nor strong
lunges to keep on in a strong carreer, in
a long and vexing winded discourse, will
not admit mee, (therefore Ile be briefe)
if you expect it.</p>
               <p>1 Pardon my inabilities I am
aged.</p>
               <p>2 Seek it where you know you may
have it.</p>
               <p>These things supposed, let me now
come seasonably to my last</p>
               <p>4 Theorems.</p>
               <p>1 The best of Churches; Saints, or
persons, may fall deeply into grosse trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions.</p>
               <p>2 The enemies to the Church and
Saints have an akeing tooth and obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
spirit of insulting and vaporing over
the Church and Saints, in their fallings,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>in this their sadd and deep declining by
transgression.</p>
               <p>3 In this distresse of falling, and the
exultancy and proud insolency of opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
they shall arise again, and the glory
of the Lord shall appear upon them in
light.</p>
               <p>These are the Theorems which I
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:109059:37"/>
must prosecute distinctly, therefore pray
take this to be the first.</p>
               <p>1. Theorem.</p>
               <p>Saints may fall into grosse and very
deep transgressions or sins against God.</p>
               <p>The demonstration of this Theorem is
firm upon these principles.</p>
               <p>1 The infinite and indeed unlimited
liberty and authoritative power the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
God hath over the creature, to do
with it what he pleaseth.</p>
               <p>Ergo</p>
               <p>1 To leave and desert when hee
will.</p>
               <p>Thence</p>
               <p>2 To give them up to themselves.</p>
               <p>2 The naturall principles of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
(being thus left without any limits
or bounds to its own propensions) from
preservation,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> it must follow inevitablely
that the springs or sluces of corruption
must break forth.</p>
               <p>Ergo,</p>
               <p>Churches and Persons, nay Saints
may rush into, and act in grosse abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.</p>
               <p>Hence then from these principles le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
us wind up all into an argumentive form<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>

               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:109059:37"/>Argument.</p>
               <p>1 Where there is an independant
liberty in any cause to sustain, or not to
sustain a created being, in a just regulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to his own will.</p>
               <p>2 And strong active principles in an
eminent deviation from the eternall rule,
there must be (and that unavoidably) a
deflexion from that eternall rule.</p>
               <p>1 But in the eternall God of Glory
in Christ, there is this independant liberty
by concession of schooles and Fathers.</p>
               <p>2 The creatures acting nothing by
their own principles, but opposition to
him and his rule and will.</p>
               <p>Ergo</p>
               <p>The creature may fall into the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
relapses, grossest sins that ever any
creature did.</p>
               <p>Thus I have twisted up my argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of reason into the forme of a sillo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisme
in mood and figure: and it being
but reason which is dark, let me support
faith with Scripture.</p>
               <p>And for this purpose Ile nominate but
two places, which will strongly evince
the conclusion it self.</p>

               <p>Isaiah 63 17.</p>
               <p>These two places will joyn in issue to
prove my conclusion against any the
least opposition.</p>
               <p>Wee will a little examine both: In the

                  </note> Well this done,
the thing did displease the Lord. Thus far
of <hi>Davids</hi> sin of murder and adultery a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
God.</p>
               <p>Having done thus farr in the business,
the detection of the horrid unparralled
villany in <hi>Davids</hi> sins; the next business is
to come in hand.</p>
               <p>1 <hi>Davids</hi> arraignment by <hi>Nathan</hi> the
Prophet: now in this we may consider
thus.</p>
               <p>1 <hi>Nathan</hi> is sent to him by commission
from the Lord,<note place="margin">Chap. 12.</note> the God of Glory, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
him of his guilt of this his sin.</p>
               <p>2. By a wile of a parable, states the
question so that <hi>David</hi> confesseth plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
he had sinned.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Nathan</hi> leaves him not in this sad
condition, under guilt, but presently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:109059:40"/>
peace, the <hi>Lord hath put away thy
sin,</hi> yet gives him a chastisement tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall:
hence then.</p>
               <p>Persons under the apprehension of
guilt, ought not to be left so: but promises
of mercy ought after the detection of
guilt to be applied.</p>
               <p>Now Bretheren the next busines.</p>
               <p>Isaiah 63. 17.</p>
               <p>If you observe the connexion of the
words, you will find the state of whole
Churches under a sad state of dereliction:
here in this verse wee find not only</p>
               <p>1 Outward transgressions, and those
of a deep die, if you compare things with
things.</p>
               <p>2 Inward opposition, or an habitual
frame of spirit: whence,</p>
               <p>1 Outward transgressions did flow a
hardened heart.</p>
               <p>2 And the frame of the spirit cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted.
Out of all these my conclusions I
will conclude. The Saints may be deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and left to great transgressions, and a
fearfull frame of spirit.</p>
               <p>But we must go on to the other conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions:
but the time is almost past, and the
time of the year unseasonable,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:109059:40"/>
And now Bretheren (since we have
brought our busines thus farr,) let me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr
these few practique Corrolaries.</p>
               <p>1 Let him that standeth take heed
least he fall.</p>
               <p>2 Keepe for the purpose vigilant eye
over your own spirits.</p>
               <p>3 Pittie those that are fallen, and
walk in darkness and see no light.</p>
               <p>4 Presume not upon examples: you
know not whether Davids restitution
may be yours.</p>
               <p>This is from the second conclusion.</p>
               <p>Insultansy of spirit over distressed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and falling sinners is incident to
man, especially enemies.</p>
               <p>Next take notice of this plaine issue.</p>
               <p>4 As presume not to act hainous trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions.</p>
               <p>5 So dispare not under their burden.
This is from the last proposition of
the three, gathered from the text: and
so these three propositions in the first
paragraphe are dispatched.</p>

               <p>Let me acquaint you with these few

               <p>1 His birth and education, with his
parts and their improvements you all

of,</p>
               <p>2 His conversation, and greatly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious
act of sin, in so near a relation,
is too well known, for me to trouble
your memories or greive your spirits a
fresh,</p>
               <p>These things we grant to the most
malevolent spirit, and contradicting spirit,
we meet with; yet for his deportment in
the time of his confinement sentence and
execution, some things must be said.</p>
               <p>1 These reverend Divines faithfully
that dealt with him, and most in fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency
in the time of his confinement,
can give a more strict and severe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt.</p>

When I had the opportunitie to visit
him, I found him in a sedate composure
of spirit; I hope in the successe of their
endeavours, and upon accompt exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with other things implicitely two
great questions resolved,</p>
               <p>1 Conviction of guilt of so great a
transgression,</p>
               <p>2 Yet this was not all but tenderness
of contrition for this and other facts.</p>
               <p>3 A totall relinquishing of any thing
of humiliation or contrition for accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p>4 Only wrapt up himself in the
armes of our Saviour Christ, as the only
refuge,</p>
               <p>Upon this accompt I did what I did
and ought to do.</p>
               <p>Let Momus carpe,</p>
               <p>Wee will leave him to his own mast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
to him he stands, or falls, or suffers;
only thus, it was his earnest desire to
receive a sealing testimony from Christ
in the ordinance, for his sealed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of his interest in him,</p>
               <p>And in this case I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I say he died a Christian: the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of this shall appeare to the shame of
his Calumnators in print from his own
hand. I confesse I have the original by
me, but will conceale it yet.</p>
               <p>I am yet confident his grand Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
