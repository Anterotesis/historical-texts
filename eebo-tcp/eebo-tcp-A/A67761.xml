            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>But for all that, a wise man will not be scoft out of his Money, nor a just man flowred out of his Faith.

For, for the comfort of all that are single and honest-hearted, notwithstanding all the scoffs and scorns of <hi>Atheists</hi> and careless worldlings, all their perswasions and persecutions, they shall both lose their labours, and themselves too in the end. Well may they intend, and also do their utmost to flout us out of our Faith, that so they may slay us with death eternal, and speed thereafter; (As <hi>God</hi> that regards not so much what is performed, as what was intended, and measures what we do by what we meant to do; as in the case of <hi>Abrahams of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering up his son,</hi> and those <hi>Jews</hi> who only thought they had killed <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 19.) but they shall be no more able to hinder the salvation of any one whom God hath chosen to his <hi>Kingdome of grace and glory,</hi> then <hi>Saul</hi> with his <hi>Courtiers</hi> could hinder <hi>David</hi> from attaining the promised <hi>Kingdom of Israel,</hi> Psal. 129. 1.

is no dispossessing him again. The League that <hi>Heaven</hi> hath made, <hi>Hell</hi> wants power to break. Who can separate the conjunctions of the <hi>Deitie? Whom God did predestinate,</hi> saith <hi>Paul, them he also called; and whom he called, them be also justified; and whom he justified, them he also glorified,</hi> Rom. 8. 30. They shall sooner blow up <hi>hell</hi> with trains of powder, then break the chain of this dependent truth. No power of <hi>men</hi> or <hi>devils</hi> is able to withstand the will of <hi>God,</hi> it shall stand firmer then the firmament.</p>
            <p>A fire in the heart overcomes all other fires without; as we see in the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,</hi> which when the sweet doctrine of <hi>Christ</hi> had once got into their hearts, it could not be got out again by all the torments that wit and cruelty could devise.</p>

            <p>THirdly, No hope it should be otherwise, since God from the beginning of the Creation, hath preclaimed a War, enmity and strife, between the wicked and the godly: Did you never read that Scripture, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. where <hi>God</hi> himself saith to the <hi>Serpent, I will put enmity between thee and the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and between thy seed and her seed; he,</hi> or it, <hi>shall bruise thine head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.</hi> Where by the <hi>serpentts seed</hi> are meant the whole generation of wicked men; and by the <hi>womans seed, Christ</hi> and all his <hi>mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> as all Interpreters conclude, and other Scriptures make cleer, where <hi>wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men</hi> are called <hi>serpents, a generation of vipers,</hi> and <hi>children of the Devil,</hi> Matth. 23. 33. John 8. 44. 1 John 3. 10. And as this war was proclaimed in <hi>Paradise,</hi> even in the beginning of time, <hi>(original sin,</hi> being the original of this discord) so it shall continue to the end of all time: When time, faith One, began, this malice first began, nor will it end but with the latest man. It is an everlasting <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> like a <hi>Statute</hi> in <hi>Magna Charta.</hi> Which is the next thing I would commend to your serious consideration: And that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:63055:3"/>
you may be the better confirmed therein, see how according to the Lords prediction or proclamation, there hath been a perpetual war, enmity and strife in all ages past, is now and ever shall be, between <hi>Satan</hi> and <hi>Christ,</hi> and their <hi>Regiments</hi> the <hi>wicked</hi> and the <hi>godly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For proof whereof I could produce testimonies and examples innumerable there being scarce a page in the Bible, which doth not express or imply some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what touching this enmity. But that I may be brief, and because <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples</hi> give a quicker impression then <hi>arguments,</hi> I will onely give you an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in every Age. As</p>
            <p>First, to begin with the <hi>first Age,</hi> viz. the <hi>old World</hi> before the flood. We read of this mortal enmity and strife between <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi> 1 John 3. 12. Secondlyl, after the Flood, before the Law between <hi>Esau</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> first in the womb, the more plainly to shadow out this enmity, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25. 22, 23. and after they were born, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27. 41. Thirdly, <hi>After the Law,</hi> before <hi>Christ,</hi> between <hi>Doeg</hi> and the 85. Priests which he <hi>slew with the edge of the sword,</hi> 1 Sam. 22. 18, 19. Fourthly, Since the <hi>Gospel,</hi> in the time of <hi>Christ,</hi> and his <hi>Apostles;</hi> this enmity so manifested it self not only in the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> but in the <hi>Jews,</hi> Gods own people, who first raised those persecutions against Christ and his members; that having beheaded <hi>John Baptist</hi> his harbinger, and crucified himself the <hi>Lord of life:</hi> We read that of all the twelve, none died a natural death save only S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> and he also was banished by <hi>Domitian</hi> to <hi>Patmos,</hi> and at another time thrust into a <hi>Tun of seething oyl</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> as <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> and S. <hi>Hierome</hi> do report: See <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 51, to 60. and 12. 1. to 5. <hi>Rom. 8. 36. Iohn</hi> 21. 18, 19. Fifthly, After the <hi>Apostles,</hi> if we consider the residue of the <hi>ten Persecutions</hi> raised by the <hi>Romans</hi> against the <hi>Christians,</hi> which was for three hundred years till the coming of godly <hi>Constantine,</hi> we finde that under <hi>Dioclesian,</hi> seventeen thousand <hi>Christians,</hi> were slain in one moneth, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst whom was <hi>Serena</hi> the Empress also. Yea, under him and nine other Emperers, there was such an innumerable company of innocent Christians put to death and tormented, that S. <hi>Hierom</hi> in his Epistle to <hi>Chromatius</hi> and <hi>Heliodorus</hi> saith, There is no one day in the year, unto which the number of five thousand <hi>Martyrs</hi> might not be ascribed, except only the first day of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary.</hi> Yea there was two thousand suffered in the same place and at the same time with <hi>Nicanor,</hi> Acts and Monuments, <hi>page</hi> 32. who were put to the most exquisite deaths and torments, that ever the wit or malice of men or devils could invent to inflict upon them, and all for professing the faith of Christ, and being holy: which makes S. <hi>Paul</hi> cry out, <hi>I think that God hath set forth us the last Apostles, as men appointed to death!</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 9.</p>

Which in part was fulfilled in <hi>England</hi> under the reign of Queen <hi>Mary;</hi> and in <hi>France,</hi> where before many late bloody Massacres, there were
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63055:4"/>
more then two hundred thousand who suffered Martyrdom about <hi>Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation:</hi> See <hi>Ecclesiastical History,</hi> lib. 6. cap. 4, 5, 16. But</p>
            <p>Seventhly, To come to these present times wherein we live: Is it possible for a man to live a conscionable and unreproveable life? abstain from <hi>drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse, swearing, prophaning the Lords day,</hi> separate himself from evill com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, be zealous for the glory of <hi>God,</hi> admonish others that do amisse <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being traduced, calumniated, hated, slandered and persecuted for the same? no it is not possible: for if our righteousnesse doe but exceed the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of a swearer, or a drunkard, we are sure to be persecuted for our righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, as <hi>Abel</hi> was persecuted of <hi>Cain,</hi> because his Sacrifice was better then his. If a man walke according to the rule of <hi>Gods</hi> Word, he is too precise; if he will be more then almost a Christian, he is curious, phantastical, facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and shall be mocked with the Spirit, as if the Spirit of God were a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of dishonour and shame. Yea, in these times not to be an Atheist, or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist, is to be a Fanatick: as how common a thing is it to wound all holiness under the name of Fanatick, a name so full of the Serpents enmity, as the egge of a Cockatrice is full of poison? What should I say? the World is grown so much knave, that 'tis now a vice to be honest. O the deplorable conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of these times! Even the Devil himself durst not have been so impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, as to have scoft at holiness in those ancient and purer times: but now I could even sink down with shame, to see Christianity every where so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenanced: Our very names come into few mouths, out of which they return but with reproaches. Amongst the rest of our sins, O God, be merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful to the contempt of thy Servants.</p>
            <p>Eightly, For the time to come: It is like not only to continue, but the last remnants of time are sure to have the most of it; because as in them <hi>love shall wax cold,</hi> Matth. 24. 12. so as love groweth cold, contention groweth hot.</p>
            <p>More expresly the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> foretells, that <hi>in the last dayes the times shall be perilous,</hi> and that <hi>toward the end of the world, there shall be scoffers, false ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusers, cursed speakers, fierce, despisers of them that are good; and being fleshly, not having the spirit, they shall speak evill of the things which they understand not: and that many shall follow their damnable ways, whereby the way of truth shall be evill spoken of.</hi> And <hi>that as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so these also shall resist the truth, being men of corrupt mindes, reprobate concerning the faith, being before of old ordained to condemnation,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 1. to 13. 2 Pet. 2. 2. and 3. 3. Jude 4. 10. 16, 18, 19. And so much of the third particular.</p>

            <p>FOurthly, It would be considered, that what you suffer is far short of what others have suffered before you; for whereas you suffer a little tongue-per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution, your betters and <hi>such as the world was not worthy of,</hi> have <hi>suffered cruel mockings, and scourgings, bonds, and imprisonments; were stoned, sawn asunder, tempted, slain with the sword: endured the violence of fire;</hi> were <hi>rackt, wandred about in desarts and mountains, in dens and caves of the earth, in sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skins, and goat skins, destitute, afflicted, and tormented: Not accepting delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that they might obtain a better resurrection,</hi> Hebr. 11. 35, to 39.

                  </gap>stical History,</hi> and you shall finde that some of the <hi>Martyrs</hi> were

But to clear your sight, Ile give you some particular instances of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral wayes that the best of <hi>Gods</hi> people have suffered before you.</p>
            <p>First, You shall finde, that it hath been the manner of wicked men, out of this enmity, to envy the vertuous and good estate of the godly: as <hi>Cain</hi> envied <hi>Abel,</hi> Gen. 4. 5. Secondly, To contemn their supposed mean estate, as <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballat, Tobia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Thirdly, To rejoyce at their supposed evill estate, as the <hi>Princes of the Philistins</hi> did at <hi>Sampsons blindness and bondage,</hi> Judg. 16. 25. Fourthly, To hate them, as all carnal men hate the <hi>members of Christ,</hi> Matth. 10. 22. Fiftly, To murmure against them, as the <hi>Israelites</hi> mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured against <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> Numb. 11. 1. and 14. 2, 3. Sixthly, To cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure their actions, and misconster their intentions, as <hi>Eliah</hi> did <hi>Davids</hi> zeal for <hi>Gods glory,</hi> in fighting with <hi>Goliah,</hi> 1 Sam. 17. 18. and those <hi>wicked ones,</hi> his fasting and mourning, <hi>Psal.</hi> 35. 13, to 17. Seventhly, By carrying tales of them unto others, as <hi>Doeg</hi> did to <hi>Saul</hi> of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Ahimeleck,</hi> 1 Sam. 22. 9, 10. and the <hi>Ziphims,</hi> 1 Sam. 23. 19, 20. and 26. 1. Eightly, To perswade and give divelish counsel to others like themselves to persecute them; as the <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Rulers</hi> did to <hi>Zedekiah the King</hi> against <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> Jer. 38. 4. Ninthly, To scoff at them, as <hi>Ishmael</hi> scoft at <hi>Isaac,</hi> Gen. 21. 9. Tenthly, To nick-name them, as the <hi>Jews</hi> did <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 24. 14. and all the <hi>Disciples,</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 9, 10. Eleventhly, To revile and rail on them, as the <hi>Jews</hi> did upon <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas,</hi> Acts 13. 45. Twelfthly, To raise slanders of them, as those wicked men slandered <hi>Naboth,</hi> confirming the same with an Oath, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21. Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenthly, To curse them, as <hi>Goliah</hi> cursed <hi>David,</hi> 1 Sam. 17. 43. and also <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mei,</hi> 2 Sam. 16. 7, to 15. Fourteenthly, To threaten them, as all the <hi>men of Sodom</hi> did <hi>Lot,</hi> Gen. 19. 9. Fifteenthly, By subtilty to undermine them in talk, that they might betray them; as the <hi>false Prophets</hi> and other enemies of the truth undermined <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> seeking every way to destroy him, <hi>Jer.</hi> 18. 18, &amp;c. Sixteenthly, By using scornful and disdainful gestures to despigh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> them; as <hi>Goliah</hi> against <hi>David,</hi> 1 Sam. 17. 42. and also those <hi>wicked ones,</hi> Psal. 22. 7. 13. and 35. 16. and 109. 25. Seventeenthly, To withstand and contrary the doctrine which they are commanded by <hi>God</hi> to deliver: As <hi>Elymas the Socerer</hi> withstood <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> in their preaching, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 8. Eighteenthly, To combine themselves together and lay divellish plots to destroy them; as <hi>Demetrius</hi> with the rest of the Craftsmen conspired the death of <hi>Pauls companions,</hi> Acts 19. and likewise <hi>more then forty of the Jews which bound themselves by a curse, not to eat nor drink till they had killed Paul,</hi> in which conspiracy the <hi>chief Priests</hi> were likewise assistants, <hi>Acts</hi> 23. 12, 13, 14. Nineteenthly, To imprison them, as the malicious <hi>Priests</hi> did <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> Jer. 36. 5. Twentieth, To strike them as <hi>Zedekiah</hi> the false Prophet strook <hi>Micaiah</hi> 1 Kings 22. 24. Twenty one, To hurt and maim them, as the <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>Antiochia</hi> and <hi>Iconium</hi> did <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 14. 19. Twenty two and lastly, To slay them, as <hi>Jezabel</hi> did all the Prophets of the Lord she could finde, 1 Kings 18. 4.</p>

Yea, so cruel, that it makes their <hi>teeth gnash,</hi> and their hearts <hi>burst</hi> again, as it fared with those that stoned <hi>Stephen,</hi> Acts 7. 54. This made the truths adversaries, give St. <hi>Paul stripes above measure,</hi> 2 Cor. 11. 23. And the <hi>Heathen Emperors</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise such cruel tortures for all those that but profest themselves <hi>Christians.</hi> This made <hi>Ahab</hi> so hate <hi>Eliah,</hi> that <hi>there was not one Kingdom or Nation where he had not sent to take away his life,</hi> 1 King. 18. 10.

            </p>
            <p>Neither does this hatred extend it self to this or that person alone, but to the whole generation of the godly; as is well exprest, <hi>Psal. 83. Come let us cut them off from being a Nation, and let the Name of Israel be no more in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,</hi> ver. 4. 12. And the like we see in <hi>Haman,</hi> whose hatred to <hi>Mordecai</hi> was so deadly, that he thought it too little to lay hands on him only, except he destroyed all the <hi>Jews</hi> his people, that were throughout the whole <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> of <hi>Ahashuerosh,</hi> Esth. 3. 5, 6. For the effecting whereof he offered <hi>ten thousand talents of silver into the Kings treasury,</hi> ver. 9. 13. And of his mind was <hi>Herodias,</hi> who preferred the head of <hi>John Baptist</hi> before <hi>the half of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rods Kingdom.</hi> And such another was cruel <hi>Arundale Archbishop of Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> who swore he would not leave a slip of professors in this Land.</p>
            <p>And the world is no changling, for this age hath but two many such <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> and <hi>Arundales,</hi> who so hate the children of <hi>God,</hi> that they wish as <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligula</hi> once did of the <hi>Romans,</hi> that they had all but one neck, that so they might cut it off at a blow, were it in their power. As why are not our <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuaries</hi> turned into <hi>Shambles?</hi> and our <hi>Beds</hi> made to swim with our <hi>Bloods?</hi> but that the <hi>God</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi> hath crossed the confederacy of <hi>Balack,</hi> and their wickedness doth not prosper. For their studies are the plots of our ruine; and the best they intend, is the destruction and overthrow of <hi>Religion,</hi> or the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious,</hi> or both, <hi>Mat. 24. 9. John</hi> 16. 2. Yea, their enmity and hatred is so vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulent and bitter, that were their power answerable to their wills and malice, the <hi>brother</hi> would betray the <hi>brother</hi> to death, the <hi>father</hi> the <hi>son,</hi> and the <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> would rise up against their <hi>parents,</hi> and cause them to die; the <hi>kinsman</hi> against the <hi>kinsman,</hi> and the <hi>friend</hi> against the <hi>friend;</hi> only for professing <hi>Christs Name</hi> and being religious, as himself affirms, <hi>Matth. 10. 34, 35, 36. Luk.</hi> 21. 16, 17. Neither is it strange, for this was one of the ends of <hi>Christs</hi> coming into the world, as appears <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 34, 35. where himself saith, <hi>Think not that I am come to send peace but the sword:</hi> meaning between the <hi>seed of the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,</hi> and the <hi>seed of the woman: for I am come to set a man at variance against his father, the daughter in law against the mother in law, and a mans enemies shall be they of his own houshold,</hi> Luke 12. 51, 52, 53.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Minister.</hi> There be more differences between the <hi>children of God</hi> and the <hi>children of the Devil,</hi> then there are between <hi>men</hi> and <hi>beasts:</hi> But principally they differ in their <hi>judgements, affections</hi> and <hi>actions.</hi> How they differ in their judgements and affections, I have shewn upon another oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion. How in their actions and practice (which occasions the greatest strife and discord) I will acquaint you as briefly as I can.</p>
            <p>There is nothing more common then for all sorts and kindes of men to <hi>hate, scorn, persecute, reproach, revile, accuse, slander</hi> and <hi>condemn</hi> the religious, <hi>because their own works are evil</hi> and wicked, and <hi>the others good, holy and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous.</hi> As wherefore slew <hi>Cain</hi> his brother, saith S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> but because <hi>his own works were evil, and his brothers good,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 12. Why was <hi>Ioseph</hi> accused of his Mistress for an adulterer, and thereupon committed to prison, but because he would not be an adulterer like her, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39? yea it was his party coloured coat, composed of all kinds of graces and blessings, that formerly procured his brothrens hate. Wherefore was holy <hi>David,</hi> as himself complains almost in every Psalm, <hi>had in derision, hated, slandered, reviled, contemned, and made a proveth and song of the drunkards, and other wicked men which sate in the gate:</hi> but because <hi>he followed the things that were good and pleasing unto God, and in him put his trust,</hi> Psal. 11. 2. and 22. 6, 7, 8. and 37 14. and 69. 10, 11, 12. And lastly (for I might be endlesse in the prosecution of this,) Why were all the <hi>just</hi> in <hi>Solomons</hi> time, <hi>had in abomination, and mockt of the wicked?</hi> but because <hi>they were upright in their way, and holy in their conversation,</hi> Pro. 29. 27. Or those numberless <hi>Martyrs, whose souls</hi> S. John <hi>saw under the Altar,</hi> Rev. 6. 9. <hi>killed?</hi> but <hi>for the Word of God, and for the testimony which they maintained?</hi> And the <hi>Master</hi> himself? not for any evil as themselvs are forced to confess, <hi>Mar.</hi> 7. 37. Which examples sufficiently prove, that <hi>that great Dragon the Devil,</hi> and these his Subjects, are <hi>wroth</hi> with none but <hi>the woman and the remnant of her seed, which keep the Commandements of God, and have the testimony of Jesus,</hi> Rev. 12. 17.

And the reason is, wheresoever Christ, comes, there will be opposition. <hi>when Christ was born, all Ierusalem was troubled, and</hi> Herod <hi>cut the throats of all the children in Bethlem:</hi> so when Christ is born in any man, the soul is in an uprore, and Satan with his instruments are ready to kill in him every good motion, though it be never so little a babe. You cannot an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger a wicked man worse, then to do well: yea, he hates you more bitterly for this, and the credit you gain thereby, then if you had cheated him of hiis pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony with your own discredit. Whereas, if a man will but bear them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in their sins, drink, swea, temporize, contemn holiness, mis-spend his time, haunt Taverns, play the good fellow, and do as the rest do; he shall have the approbation and good word of the greatest number. Yea if none would be precise in their actions, nor reprove others for their evill courses; if they would but be prophane and wicked, and make no bones of sin; their malice would cease, and we should not have a <hi>Roundhead</hi> or a <hi>Pha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Neither is <hi>Christ a sign to be spoken against of many in Babylon or Assyria,</hi> but of many in <hi>Israel,</hi> Luke 2. 34. where Religion is profest publikely: Yea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when sincerity is wanting, the neerer the <hi>line</hi> with any opposition, the greater <hi>eclipse.</hi> The <hi>Gadarens</hi> but besought Christ to depart; his own countrymen drave him out, and cast him down headlong, <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 29.

            </p>
            <p>Yea commonly, vertue fares hardest from such as should and seem <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And intruders upon other mens right, can endure any man how bad soever rather to live by them, then the servants of him whom they intrude upon; as you may see, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 33, to 39. where those <hi>farmers</hi> of the <hi>vineyard</hi> did not kill the theeves, robbers and spoilers of the vineyard; but the servants, yea and the son too; and the end of all was, that they might take the inheritance.

If <hi>Joseph</hi> be his fathers darling, he is his brethrens eye-sore. Wherefore did <hi>Saul</hi> persecute <hi>David,</hi> and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue after him from place to place to take away his life, but because he was so praised and preferred of the people before himself? and the <hi>Lord was with David, and prospered him in every thing he took in hand,</hi> 1 Sam. 18. 12, 13, 28, 29. <hi>Davids</hi> successe is <hi>Sauls</hi> vexation; yea, he findes not so much pleasure in his <hi>Kingdome,</hi> as vexation in the prosperity of <hi>David?</hi> And last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (for I passe by the <hi>Elder Brothers</hi> envie in the <hi>Parable</hi> against his <hi>younger Brother,</hi> when his Father so royally entertained him at his return, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 28. which is meant of the <hi>Jewes</hi> envying the <hi>Gentiles</hi> conversion, and many the like instances.)

Its a plain case, if the <hi>Gospel</hi> should <hi>rise, sin</hi> and <hi>error</hi> must go <hi>down; Herod</hi> thought he could not be <hi>King,</hi> if Christ should reign; And the Pharisees knew that they should be <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised,</hi> if Christ were <hi>regarded.</hi> And this makes them <hi>watch for our halt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and withall as sharp sighted as <hi>Eagles</hi> to spy faults in us: Briefly, They put their own faults in that part of the Wallet which is behinde them; but ours, in the other part or end which is before them. Indeed self-examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on would make their judgements more charitable.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, They delight in censuring and slandering us: because Satan (who is their God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4. and their Prince, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14 30. <hi>and works in them his pleasure,</hi> Eph. 2. 2. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 26.) is ever prompting them thereunto, <hi>Acts 5. 3.

            <p>And they being his Sons, Servants and Subjects, thirst to do him what ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and service they can. Nor can they pleasure him more, it being the hopefullest way to discourage men in the way to heaven, quench the good motions of Gods spirit, kill the buds and beginnings of grace, draw them back to the world, and so by consequence damn their souls, that can be, to see that whatsoever they do or speak; base constructions are made thereof. Hereupon that subtil Serpent does like <hi>Maximinus</hi> who set on work certain vile persons to accuse the Christians of hainous crimes, that so he might persecute them with the more shew of reason. True, they poor souls do not know that Satan speaks in and by them: As those four hundred of <hi>Ababs</hi> Prophets, in whom this evil spirit spake, did not know that Satan spake by them, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22. 22.
