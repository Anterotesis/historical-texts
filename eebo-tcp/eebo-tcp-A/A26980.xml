            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

for our work-ſake, but falſ-hearted profeſſors that turn from the
truth, do preſently turn Malignants againſt the Miniſtry; and many
weak ones that are better minded, are dangerouſly ſeduced into a
guilt of the ſedition. To all theſe I here proclaim in the name and
word of the Lord, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. 26. [<hi>Depart I pray you from the tents
of theſe wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, leſt ye be conſumed
in all their ſins.</hi>] Which I ſhall now open to you.</p>
            <p>1. The office of the Miniſtry is an undoubted Ordinance of God,
to continue in the Church to the end of the world. No man can
pretend that they ceaſed with the Apoſtles; for it is Gods will
that ordinary fixed Presbyters ſhall be ordained in every Church,
<hi>Acts</hi> 14. 23. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 5. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2. And Paſtors and
Teachers are appointed for the perfecting of the Saints, for the
work of the Miniſtry, and edifying of the body of Chriſt; till we
all come to a perfect man, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 11, 12, 13. A Miniſtry autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60958:3"/>
to Diſciple the Nations, baptize and teach them, is inſtituted
by Chriſt as King and Saviour, and have his Promiſe to be with
them alway to the end of the world, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 18, 19, 20. The ſame
neceſſity and work continueth; ſtill ſouls are born and bred in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
and how ſhall they be ſaved without believing, or believe
without hearing, or hear without preaching, or we preach without
ſending? <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 13, 14, 15. There is a clearer word in the Goſpel
for the Miniſtry then the Magiſtracy; though enough for both. Our
own call I ſhall ſpeak of anon.</p>
            <p>2. Theſe Malignants ſet themſelves againſt the Principal mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Body of Chriſt, that are in it as the eyes and hands to
the natural body, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 16, 19, 27, 29. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 11, 15.
The Miniſters of Chriſt, and Stewards of the myſteries of God,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 1. The Over ſeers of the flock that is purchaſed with
Chriſts blood, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. They are the chief members, 1. in Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice;
2. Ordinarily in gifts for edification of the body: 3. And
in Grace. Now a wound in the ſtomack or liver is more mortal to
the body, then in the hand: and the loſs of an eye or hand is worſe
then the loſs of an ear.</p>
            <p>3. Theſe Malignants are therefore principally enemies to the
Church it ſelf. They take on them to be only againſt the Miniſters,
but it will prove moſt againſt the people and whole Church. If they
ſinite the Shepherds, the ſheep will be ſcattered. How can they
more ſurely ruin Chriſts Family, then by caſting out the Stewards
that muſt Rule, and give the children their meat in due ſeaſon, even
milk to the babes, and ſtronger meat to them of full age, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 12,
13, 14. <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 42. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 45. What readier way to ruine the
Schools of Chriſt, then by caſting out the Teachers that he hath
appointed under him? Or to ruine his Kingdom, then to reject his
Officers? Or to wrong the body, then to cut off the hands, and pull
out the eyes, or to deſtroy the principal parts: Was it not Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
that planted the Churches, and converted the world, and have
ever born off the aſſaults of enemies? where was there ever
Church on earth that continued without a Miniſter? The great
Kingdom of <hi>Nubia</hi> fell from Chriſtianity for want of Preachers.
The Nations that have the weakeſt and feweſt Miniſters, have the
leaſt of Chriſtianity: and thoſe that have the moſt and ableſt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,
have the moſt flouriſhing ſtate of Religion. All over the
world the Church doth riſe or fall with the Miniſtry: Cut down
the Pillars, and the building falls. He is blind that ſees not what
would become of the Church, were it not for the Miniſtry. Who
ſhould teach the ignorant, or rebuke the obſtinate, explain the word
of truth, and ſtop the mouthes of proud gain-ſayers? What work
would hereſies, and diviſion, and prophanneſs make, if theſe banks
were cut down? when all that can be done is ſtill too little. It
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60958:3"/>
muſt needs therefore be meet enmity againſt the Church that makes
men malignant againſt the Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>4. The deſign of the maligners of the Miniſtry is plainly againſt
the Goſpel and Chriſtianity it ſelf. They take the readieſt way in
the world to bring in Heatheniſm, Infidelity and Atheiſm, which
Chriſtianity hath ſo far baniſhed. For it is the Miniſtry that Chriſt
uſeth to bring in light, and drive and keep out this damnable dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<hi>Acts</hi> 26. 17, 18. [<hi>I ſend thee to open their eyes, and turn them
from darkneſs to light,</hi> &amp;c.] Why are ſo many Nations Infidels, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans
and Idolaters, but for want of Miniſters to preach the
Goſpel to them? Theſe Malignants therefore would take down the
Sun, and baniſh Chriſtianity out of the world.</p>
            <p>5. And they hinder the converſion of particular ſouls, and ſo are
the cruelleſt wretches on earth. Though an Angel muſt be ſent to
<hi>Cornelius,</hi> it is not to be inſtead of a Preacher, but to ſend him to a
Preacher, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. Though Chriſt would wonderfully appear to
<hi>Saul,</hi> it is to ſend him to <hi>Ananias</hi> for inſtruction, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. Though
the Jaylor muſt feel an Earth-quake, and ſee miracles, it is but to
prepare him for the Miniſters words, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. <hi>Philip</hi> muſt be carried
by an Angel to expound to an Eunuch the word that muſt convert
him. The Miniſtry is Gods inſtituted ſetled way, by which he will
convert and ſave the world, as truly as the light is the natural way
by which he will corporally enlighten them, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 18. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 16.
<hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 14. <hi>Rom</hi> 10. 14. Do you think ſo many ſouls would be
converted if the Miniſtry were down? Do you not ſee that the
very contempt of them, that the ſcorns of the ungodly, and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of Malignant Apoſtates have occaſioned, doth hinder moſt of
the ignorant and prophane from receiving the ſaving benefit of the
Goſpel? How many millions of ſouls would theſe wretches ſweep
away to hell, if they had their will? while thouſands are in dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
for want of the light, they would take it from you, that you
might go there alſo. Do you not underſtand the meaning of theſe
words againſt Chriſts Miniſters? Why the meaning is this: They
make a motion to the people of the Land, to go to Hell with one
conſent, and to hate thoſe that are appointed to keep them out of
it. They would take the bread of life from your mouthes. They are
attempting an hundred times more cruelty on you, then <hi>Herod</hi> on
the Jews when he killed the children, or the Iriſh that murdered
the Proteſtants by thouſands; as the ſoul is of greater worth then
the body.</p>
            <p>6. Theſe Malignants againſt the Miniſtry are the flat enemies of
Chriſt himſelf, and ſo he will take them and uſe them. He that
would root out the inferiour Magiſtrates, is an enemy to the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign;
and he that is againſt the Officers of the Army, is an enemy
to the General: Chriſt never intended to ſtay viſibly on earth, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60958:4"/>
to Teach and Rule the world immediately in perſon; but he that is
the King will Rule by his Officers; and he that is Prophet will
Teach us by his Officers; and therefore he hath plainly told us
[<hi>He that h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>areth you, heareth me; and he that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth
me; and he that despiſeth me, despiſeth him that ſent me,</hi> Luke 10.
16.] O fearful caſe of miſerable Malignants! Durſt thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe
the Lord thy Maker and Redeemer, if he appeared to thee in
his glory! to whom the Sun it ſelf is as darkneſs, and all the world
as duſt and nothing. Remember when thou next ſpeakeſt againſt
his Officers, or heareſt others ſpeak againſt them, that their words
are ſpoken againſt the face of Chriſt, and of the Father. I would
not be found in the cafe of one of theſe Malignants, when Chriſt
ſhall come to judge his enemies, for a thouſand worlds. He that
hath ſaid, [<hi>Touch not mine annointed, and do my Prophets no harm;
and hath rebuked Kings for their ſakes,</hi> Pſalm 105. 15. will <hi>deride</hi>
all thoſe that would <hi>break his bands,</hi> and will <hi>break them as with a
rod of iron, and daſh them in pieces as a potters veſſel,</hi> Pſalm 2. 3, 4, 9.
And as he hath told them plainly, [<hi>Who ſo despiſeth the Word ſhall
be deſtroyed,</hi> Prov. 13. 13.] And [<hi>He that despiſeth, despiſeth not
man but God,</hi> 1 Theſ. 4. 8.] So he hath told us that <hi>it ſhall be eaſier
for</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Gomorrah <hi>in the day of Judgement, then for ſuch,</hi> Mat.
10. 15. Many a thouſand prouder enemies then you hath Chriſt
broken; and look to your ſelves, for your day is coming. If you
had but <hi>ſtumbled on this ſtone, it would have broken you in pieces;</hi> but
ſeeing you will ſtrive againſt it, it will <hi>fall on you, and grinde you to
pouder,</hi> Matth. 21. 44. And then you ſhall ſee that he that made
them his Embaſſadors, will bear them out, and ſay, [<hi>In as much as
you did it to theſe, you did it to me.</hi>] And you ſhall then ſay, <hi>Bleſſed
are they that truſt in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. It is apparent that theſe enemies of the Miniſters, are playing
the Papiſts game. Becauſe the juſt diſgrace of <hi>their</hi> Miniſtry, was
the ruin of <hi>their</hi> Kingdom; therefore they hope to win of <hi>us</hi> at the
ſame game. They know that if the people were brought into a
hatred or ſuſpition of their guides, they might the eaſier be won to
them. They tell us in their writings, that not one of ten of our
people but taketh his faith on truſt from their Teachers; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
take them off from them, and they will fall: but they delude
themſelves in this: For though the ungodly among us have no
true faith of their own, and the godly muſt lean on the hand of their
ſupporters, yet there is in them a living principle; and we do not
as the Papiſt prieſts, teach our people to ſee with our eyes, and no
matter for their own: but we help to clear their own eye-ſight.
Doubt not but the moſt of the ſects in the Land that rail againſt
the Miniſtry, are knowingly or ignorantly the Agents of the Papiſts.
For the principal work of a Papiſt is to cry down the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60958:4"/>
and the Scripture, and to ſet all they can on the ſame
work.</p>
            <p>8. Theſe ſects that are againſt the Miniſtry do all the ſame work
as the Drunkards, Whore-mongers, Covetous, and all ungodly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
in our Pariſhes do: And therefore it ſeems they are guided by
the ſame ſpirit. It is the work of Drunkards and all theſe wicked
wretches to hate, and deſpiſe, and revile the Miniſters, and to teach
others to ſay as they. And juſt ſo do Quakers, Seekers, Papiſts and
all other Malignants reproach the ſame Miniſters: And yet
the blind wretches will not ſee that the ſame Spirit moveth
them.</p>
            <p>9. It is apparent that it is the Devils game they play, and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
and Kingdom which they promote. Who fights againſt Chriſts
Officers and Army, but the General of the contrary Army? What
greater ſervice could all the world do for the Devil then to caſt
out the Miniſters of Chriſt? and what more would the Devil him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
deſire, to ſet up his Kingdom and ſuppreſs the Church?
Wretches! you ſhall ſhortly ſee your maſter, and he will pay you
your wages contrary to your expectation. Read Gods Word to a
Malignant, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 10.</p>
            <p>10. Theſe enemies do reproach as faithful a Miniſtry as the
world enjoyeth, and their malice hath ſo little footing, as that the
reſult muſt be their own ſhame. Among the Papiſts indeed there
are Maſs-prieſts that can but read a Maſs, whoſe office is to turn a
piece of bread into a God; And yet theſe the Malignants either
let alone, or liken us to them. The Greeks, and Ethiopians, and
moſt of the Chriſtian world, have a Miniſtry that ſeldom or never
preach to them, but read Common-prayer and Homilies. The moſt
of the Proteſtant Churches have a learned Miniſtry that is ſo taken
up with Controverſies; that they are much leſs in the powerful
preaching and practice of godlineſs: Above all Nations under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
the Engliſh are ſet upon Practical Divinity and Holineſs; and
yet even they are by Malignity choſen out for reproach. Alas,
ſcandals in the Miniſtry, (as drunkenneſs, ſwearing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) among
other Nations are but too common: but in <hi>England</hi> Magiſtrates and
Miniſters combine againſt them. Miniſters are ſtill ſpurring on the
Magiſtrates to caſt out the inſufficient, negligent and ſcandalous;
and deſire and uſe more ſeverity with men of their own profeſſion,
then with Magiſtrates or any others in the Land. In nothing are
they more zealous then to ſweep out all the remnant of the ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.
And for themſelves, they are devoted to the work of the
Lord, and think nothing too much that they are able to perform,
but preach in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, with all long-ſuffering and
doctrine; and yet Malignants make them their reproach.</p>
            <p>11. It is abundance of Pride and Impudency, that theſe Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60958:5"/>
enemies are guilty of. They are moſt of them perſons of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable
ignorance; and yet they dare revile at the Teachers, and
think themſelves wiſe enough to rebuke and teach them: Many of
them are men of wicked lives; and yet they can tell the world how
bad the Miniſters are. A Railer, a Drunkard, a Covetous World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
an Ignorant Sott, is the likeſt perſon to fall upon the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter;
and the Owl will call the Lark a night-bird. Alas, when we
come to try them, what dark wretches do we find them! and ſhould
be glad if they were but teachable. And yet they have learnt the
Devils firſt leſſon, to deſpiſe their Teachers.</p>
            <p>12. And O what barbarous ingratitude are theſe Malignant ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of the Miniſtry guilty of! For whom do we watch, but for them
and others? Can they be ſo blind as to think a painful Miniſter doth
make it his deſign to ſeek himſelf, or to look after great matters in
the world? Would not the time, and labour, and coſt that they are
at in the Schools and Univerſities have fitted them for a more gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
trade? Do not Lawyers, Phyſitians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> live a far eaſier, and
in the world a more honourable plentiful life? Have not the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
themſelves been the principal Inſtruments of taking down
Biſhops, Deans and Chapters, Arch-deacons, Prebends, and all
means of preferment? And what have they got by it? or ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured?
Speak malice, and ſpare not. Is it any thing but what
they had before? even the maintenance due to their particular
charge. Unthankful wretches! It is for your ſakes and ſouls that
they ſtudy, and pray, and watch, and faſt, and exhort, and labor, to
the conſuming of their ſtrength; and when they have done, are
made the Drunkards ſong, and the ſcorn of all the wicked of the
Countrey; and when they ſpend and are ſpent, the more they love,
the leſs they are beloved. In the times of this greateſt proſperity
of the Church, they live under conſtant hatred and ſcorn, from
thoſe that they would ſave, and will not let alone in ſin. And what
do they endure all this for but Gods honour and your ſalvation?
Would we be Miniſters for any lower ends? Let ſhame from God
and man be on the face of ſuch a Miniſter! I profeſs, were it not
for the belief of the greatneſs, and neceſſity, and excellency of the
truths that I am to preach, and for the will of God and the good
of ſouls, I would be a Plow-man, or the meaneſt Trade, if not a
ſweep-Chimney, rather then a Miniſter. Muſt we break our health,
and lay by all our worldly intereſt, for <hi>you,</hi> even for <hi>you,</hi> and think
not our lives and labours too good or too dear to further your ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and muſt we by <hi>you,</hi> even by <hi>you,</hi> be reproached after all? God
will be Judge between you and us, whether this be not inhumane
ingratitude, and whether we deſerve it at your hands.</p>
            <p>13. Yea it is <hi>Injuſtice</hi> alſo that you are guilty of. <hi>The labourer,</hi>
ſaith Chriſt, <hi>is worthy of his hire, Luke</hi> 10. 7. (Mark that, you

to ſave your ſouls? Will you ſpit in their faces for ſeeking with
all their might to keep you from Hell? Is that their wages that you

that he would convert you, and forgive you, and turn away the evil
that was over you: And when all theſe our prayers, and groans, and
tears ſhall be remembred againſt you, O miſerable ſouls, how dear
will you pay for all?</p>
            <p>14. And is it not a wonder that theſe Malignants do not ſee what
evident light of Scripture they contradict; and how many great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
commands they violate? They break the fifth Commandment,
which requireth honour as well to ſpiritual Eccleſiaſtical parents, as
to civil and natural. And he that curſeth Father and Mother, his

abundance more ſuch paſſages as theſe? Do not you feel theſe
flie in your faces when you oppoſe the Miniſters of Chriſt? Doth a
thief or murderer ſin againſt plainer light then you?</p>
            <p>15. Theſe Malignants ſin againſt the conſent and experience of
the Univerſal Church of Chriſt till this day. The whole Church
hath been for the Miniſtry, and inſtructed by them: and as the
child doth ſeek the breaſt, ſo did new born Chriſtians in all ages
ſeek the word from the Miniſters, that they may live and grow
thereby. And all the Nations of the Chriſtian world are for the
Miniſtry to this day! Or elſe they could not be for Chriſt, and
for the Church and Goſpel. Is it not plain therefore that theſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants
are dead branches, cut off from the Church, that are ſo ſet
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60958:6"/>
againſt the Spirit and intereſt of the Church?</p>
            <p>16. Moreover they ſin againſt the experience of all, or almoſt
all the true Chriſtians in the world. For they have all experience
that Miniſters are either their Fathers or Nurſes in the Lord.
And that by their means they have had their life, and ſtrength, and
comforts: their ſins killed, their graces quickened, their doubts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved;
the taſte of the good Word of God, and of the powers of
the world to come. May we not challenge you as <hi>Paul</hi> oft doth
his flock, Whether you did not receive the illuminating, ſanctifying
Spirit by the Miniſtry, if ever you received it? I tell you, it is as
much againſt the new and holy nature of the Saints to deſpiſe the
Miniſters of Chriſt, as it is unnatural for a child to ſpit in the face
of his Father or Mother. And the experience of ſound Chriſtians
will keep them cloſer, and help them much againſt this inhumanity,
what ever hypocrites may do.</p>
            <p>17. And if theſe Malignants had not <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart, they
would ſure have conſidered, that the experience of all Ages tells
them, that ſtill the moſt wicked have been the enemies of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry,
and the moſt godly have moſt obeyed and honoured them in
the Lord; and that this enmity hath been the common brand of
the rebellious, and the fore-runner of the heavy wrath of God; and
that it hath gone worſt with the enemies, and beſt with the friends
of a godly Miniſtry. Do I need to prove this, which is ſo much of
the ſubſtance of the old Teſtament and the New? Was it the
friends or enemies of all the Prophets, Apoſtles and Miniſters of
Chriſt, that Scripture and all good writers do commend? Do not
the names of all Malignants againſt the godly Miniſtry ſtink above
ground, as the ſhame of mankind, except thoſe that are buried out
of hearing, or thoſe that were converted?</p>
            <p>18. Nay ſuch are noted for the <hi>higheſt</hi> ſort of the wicked upon
earth: worſe then Drunkards, Whore-mongers and ſuch filthy
beaſts: The perſecutors of Gods Miniſters have been ever taken as
walking Devils. And the hotteſt of Gods wrath hath faln upon
them. Take two inſtances, 1. When the Jews went into Captivity,
this was the very cauſe, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36. 15, 16. [<hi>But they mocked the
Meſſengers of God, and despiſed his words, and miſuſed his Prophets,
till the wrath of the Lord aroſe againſt his people, till there was no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.</hi>
2. And when the Jews were cut quite off from the Church,
and made Vagabonds on the earth, this was the very cauſe, <hi>Acts</hi>
28. 28. <hi>Be it known therefore to you, that the ſalvation of God is ſent
to the Gentiles, and that they will hear it.</hi>] 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 15, 16. Theſe
Jews [<hi>both killed the Lord Jeſus, and their own Prophets, and have
perſecuted us: and they pleaſe not God, and are contrary to all men,
forbidding us to ſpeak to the Gentiles, that they might be ſaved, to fill up
their ſin alway; for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermoſt.</hi>]</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:60958:6"/>
19. It is the Devils own part that theſe Malignants act: For it is
he that is the great enemy of Chriſt and the Saints, and he that is
<hi>the accuſer of the Brethren, which accuſeth them before God day and
night:</hi> And is not this the work of Quakers, Drunkards, Papiſts
and all Malignants? But the Lord will rebuke them, and be the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of his ſervants, <hi>Zach.</hi> 3. 1, 2. [<hi>He ſhewed me</hi> Joſhua <hi>the high
Prieſt ſtanding before the Angel of the Lord, and Satan ſtanding at his
right hand to reſiſt him. And the Lord ſaid unto Satan: The Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke
thee O Satan, even the Lord that hath choſen Jeruſalem.</hi>]</p>
            <p>20. Theſe Malignants do moſt of them condemn themſelves; for
they honour the antient Miniſters of Chriſt that are dead, even
while they oppoſe and hate the preſent that are living, who are the
neareſt imitaters of their Doctrine and life that are on earth! The
name of <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> they honour, and ſome of them
keep holy-dayes for them. And at the ſame time hate and reproach
thoſe that preach the ſame Doctrine, and that becauſe they tread in
their ſteps. They honour the names of <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> and
<hi>Hierom,</hi> and other Ancients: and hate thoſe that preach and live as
they did. They ſpeak honourably of the Martyrs that were burned
to death for the Doctrine of Chriſt; and at the ſame time they hate
us, for doing as they did. What difference between the calling,
doctrine and lives of thoſe martyred Miniſters, and theſe that are
now alive? O wretched hypocrites, do you not know that theſe
Apoſtles, Fathers and other Miniſters, did ſuffer in their time from
ſuch as you, as we now do and more? Hear what Chriſt ſaith to
ſuch as you, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 29, 30, 31. [<hi>Wo to your Scribes, Phariſees,
Hypocrites: becauſe ye build the tombes of the Prophets, and garniſh
the Sepulchres of the righteous, and ſay, If we had been in the dayes
of our Fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood
of the Prophets: Ye are witneſſes to your ſelves that ye are the children
of them which killed the Prophets,: fill ye up then the meaſure of your
Fathers: Ye Serpents, ye generation of Vipers, how can ye eſcape the
damnation of Hell?</hi>]</p>
            <p>21. Moreover theſe Malignants do harden themſelves againſt
the freſheſt of the Judgements of God, which ſome of their own
hands have executed: and juſtifie the perſecutors, and ſucceed them
in their fury. Have you forgotten what God hath done here againſt
the Papal enemies of the Goſpel and Miniſtry, in 88. and the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-plot,
and many other times? Have you already forgotten how
the perſecutots of a godly Miniſtry have ſped within theſe ſixteen
years in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland?</hi> And dare you now ſtand up in their
room and make your ſelves the heirs of their ſin, and puniſhment,
and juſtifie them in all their Malignity? What do you but juſtifie
them, when you rave againſt, and revile the ſame ſort of Miniſters,
and many of the ſame perſons, whom the former Malignants perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted?
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60958:7"/>
and oppoſe the ſame ſort of Miniſters that the Papiſts burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
And would not you do the like by them if you had power in
your hands? Can any wiſe man doubt of it, Whether Papiſts, and
Quakers, and Drunkards, that now make it their work to make the
Miniſtry odious, would not ſoon diſpatch them if they could? Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
be the great Protector of the Church; for were it not for him,
our lives would ſoon be a prey to your cruelty.</p>
            <p>22. And indeed if theſe Malignants had their wills, they would
undo themſelves, and cut down the bough they ſtand upon, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
the little hope and help that is yet left for their miſerable
ſouls: It is for the ſake of Gods ſervants among them that judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are ſo long kept off them. And as long as the Goſpel and
Miniſtry remains, ſalvation is offered them: the Voyce of mercy is
calling after them, <hi>Repent and live.</hi> They have the light ſhining in
their eyes, which may at laſt convince them, as <hi>Paul</hi> was convinced
of his perſecution: the voyce which they deſpiſe may poſſibly awake
them. Though they have leſs hope then others; yet there is ſome.
But if they had their will, and were rid of the Miniſtry, alas what
would the forlorn wretches do? Then they might damn themſelves
without diſturbance, and go quietly to hell, and no body ſtop them,
and ſay, [<hi>Why do you ſo?</hi>]</p>
            <p>23. And I pray you conſider what it is that theſe men would
have. What if the Miniſters were all caſt out? would they have
any to do Gods work in their ſtead, or none? If <hi>none,</hi> you may ſee
what they are doing: if <hi>any,</hi> Who and where are they? Is it not
horrible Pride if all theſe ſilly ſouls do think that they can do it
better themſelves? And what elſe do Quakers and all theſe ſectst
that are the enemies of the Miniſtry? Do they not go up and down
the Land, and ſay to the wiſeſt holyeſt Teachers, as if they took them
by the ſleeve, [<hi>Come down and let me preach that can do it better:
Come down thou deceiver and ignorant man, and let me come up that am
wiſer, and better, and know more: Out with theſe proud Lordly Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and let us be your Teachers, that are more holy, and humble, and
ſelf-denying then they.</hi>] Is not this the loud language of their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?
And can you not hear the Devil in theſe words of higheſt
Pride and Arrogancy? But really Sirs, do you think that theſe men
would teach you better? And is there enow that are wiſer and
better then we to fill up our rooms, if we were out? Do but prove
that, and you ſhall have my conſent to baniſh all the Miniſters in
<hi>England,</hi> to ſome place that hath greater need of their labour, that
they may no more trouble you that have no need of them, and keep
out better.</p>
            <p>24. Laſtly, conſider on what ſenſleſs pretences all this enmity
againſt the Miniſtry doth vent it ſelf. You ſhall hear the worſt that
they have to ſay againſt us, (though but briefly) and then judge.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:60958:7"/>
1. The Quakers ſay, We are <hi>idle drones that labour not, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſhould not eat. Anſw.</hi> The worſt I wiſh you, is, that you had but
my eaſe inſtead of your labour. I have reaſon to take my ſelf for
the leaſt of Saints, and yet I fear not to tell the accuſer, that I
take the labour of moſt Tradeſmen in the Town to be a pleaſure to
the body in compariſon of mine; (though for the ends and the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of my mind, I would not change it with the greateſt Prince)
Their labour <hi>preſerveth</hi> health, and mine <hi>conſumeth</hi> it: They work
in eaſe, and I in continual pain: They have hours and dayes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation,
I have ſcarce time to eat and drink. No body moleſteth
them for their labour; but the more I do, the more hatred and trouble
I draw upon me. If a Quaker ask me, what all this labour is, let
him come and ſee, or do as I do, and he ſhall know.</p>
            <p>2. They accuſe us of <hi>covetouſneſs and oppreſſion, becauſe we take
tithes or hire,</hi> (as they call it) <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Is it not malice or ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious
covetouſneſs that frameth this accuſation? <hi>Whoſe</hi> are the
Tithes? are they <hi>ours</hi> or <hi>theirs?</hi> The ſame Law of the Land that
makes the nine parts theirs, doth make the tenth ours. If we have
no title to the tenth, they have none to the reſt. We ask none of
our people for a farthing. They <hi>give</hi> it not to us: It was never
<hi>theirs.</hi> When they buy or take Leaſes of their Land, it is only the
nine parts that they pay for; and if the tenths were ſold them, they
ſhould pay themſelves a tenth part more. And would theſe men
make all the people thieves and covetous, to take or deſire that
which never was their own? Nay would they have them rob God,
to whom for his ſervice the Tithes were devoted? Read <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 8,
9, 10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 22. <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. 20. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 6, 9. And whether Tithe
it ſelf be of Divine inſtitution ſtill, is more then they are able to
diſprove. Sure I am, when Chriſt told them of <hi>tithing mint and cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,</hi>
he ſaith, <hi>Theſe ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other
undone, Mat.</hi> 23. 23. 2. But moſt certain I am that God hath made
it our duty to <hi>meditate</hi> on his Word, and <hi>give our ſelves wholly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi>
1 Tim. 4. 15. and that we may [<hi>Forbear working, and not go on
warfare at our own charge; and ſowing to men ſpiritual things, ſhould
reap their carnal things; Do ye not know that they which miniſter about
holy things, live of the things of the Temple; and they which wait at
the Altar, are partakers with the Altar? Even ſo hath the Lord ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that they which preach the Gospel ſhould live of the Gospel.</hi>] 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
9. 6, 7, 13, 14. 3. And know you not that the Primitive Chriſtians
gave not only the tenths, but all that they had, and laid it at
the Apoſtles feet, to ſhew that the Goſpel teacheth more clearly
then the Law, the neceſſity of dedicating our ſelves and all that we
have to God. 4. And yet I muſt ſay, that we are <hi>content with food
and rayment.</hi> Moſt Miniſters in <hi>England</hi> would be glad to give you
all their tithes, if you will but allow them food and rayment for
themſelves and families, and ſuch education for their children as
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60958:8"/>
is fitteſt to make them ſerviceable to God. And I hope it is no ſin
to have mouths that muſt be fed, or backs that muſt be cloathed.
What I muſt Gods Miniſters above all others be grudged <hi>food and
raiment,</hi> and that of the Lords portion, which none of you pay
for? I fear not to imitate <hi>Paul</hi> ſtopping the mouths of malicious
accuſers, and to tell you, that the Miniſters, whoſe expences I am ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with, do give 500. pence for 50. that they receive by gift
from their people: and that they take all that they have as Chriſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and not their own; and if they have never ſo much they devote
it wholly to him, and know he's not beholden to them for it: and
ſome of them lay out in charitable uſes, much more then all the
tithes that they receive for their Miniſterial maintenance. And if
the Quakers that accuſe them of covetouſneſs, would caſt up ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
with them, I doubt not but it will be found that they receive
more by gift then Preachers, and give not the fourth part ſo much
when they have done.</p>
            <p>3. Another accuſation is, that we <hi>preach falſe doctrine, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the people. Anſw.</hi> It's eaſie to ſay ſo of any man in the world:
but when they come to prove it, you will ſee who are the deceivers.</p>
            <p>4. Another is, that we are <hi>perſecutors, and like the Prieſts of old,
and ſo all the reproofs of them and the Phariſees belong to us. Anſw.</hi>
This is ſoon ſaid too: but where's the proof? For themſelves we
have no mind to be troubled with them. Let them let us alone; as
long as we will let them alone. But yet they ſhall be taught one
day to know, that if the Magiſtrate ſtop the mouths of ſuch Railers
and abuſers of God and men, he doth no more perſecute them, then
he perſecuteth a thief when he hangeth him: or then <hi>Paul</hi> perſecut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Hymenaeus</hi> and <hi>Philetus</hi> when he delivered them up to Satan; or
<hi>Elymas, Acts</hi> 13. 11. or then <hi>Peter</hi> perſecuted <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,
Acts</hi> 5. or then God would have had the Churches be perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
againſt the woman <hi>Jezebel</hi> that was ſuffered to teach and ſeduce
the people, or againſt the Doctrine of the Nicolaitans which God
hated, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 15, 20. If <hi>hindering ſin,</hi> be <hi>perſecuting,</hi> the <hi>calling</hi> of
a <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> is to be a perſecutor, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 4. and all parents muſt
perſecute their own children.</p>
            <p>5. Another accuſation is, that we are <hi>againſt the preaching of any
but our ſelves. Anſw.</hi> Who doth not deſire that all the Lords peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
were Prophets? But yet we know all are not Prophets, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
12. 29. nor Teachers. We would have none of Gods gifts in our
people huried, but all improved to the uttermoſt, for his glory. But
we would not have men turn Ordinary Teachers, that are neither
ſound, nor able, nor ſent; nor every ſelf-conceited ignorant man
have leave to abuſe the Name and Word of God, and the ſou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s of
men. What would you have more then is granted you? When any
unordained man that is judged competent by the Commiſſioners of
Approbation, (of whom ſome are Souldiers) may be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60958:8"/>
Preacher, and have fulleſt maintenance, as well as Presbyters?</p>
            <p>6. Another charge is, that we <hi>are ſome weak, and ſome ſcandalous.
Anſw.</hi> We do all that we are able to caſt out ſuch; and I think ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
more was done. The Magiſtrate ſets his guard at the door, and
lets in none but whom he pleaſe: and ſure if he <hi>knew</hi> where to have
better then thoſe that are in, he would put them in, or elſe he is too
blame. If he do not know, will you blame him for uſing the beſt
that he can get? But if you will come and help us to caſt out any
that are vitious and unworthy, we will give you thanks.</p>
            <p>7. Another accuſation is, that <hi>we differ among our ſelves, and
one ſaith one thing, and another another thing. Anſw.</hi> 1. And are
all theſe ſects that oppoſe us, better agreed among themſelves? En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
and judge. 2. Do not all preach one Goſpel, and the ſame
Eſſentials of the Chriſtian Faith? And we expect not perfect unity,
till we have perfect Knowledge and Holineſs; which we dare not
boaſt of, what ever Quakers do.</p>
            <p>8. Another accuſation is, that <hi>we are not true Miniſters.</hi> And why
ſo? Becauſe we have not an uninterrupted ſucceſſion of lawful
Ordination. <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Objection is the Papiſts, who have little
reaſon to uſe it, while it is ſo eaſie a matter to prove ſo many inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
of their Papal ſucceſſion. At large and often have we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
them, and are ſtill ready to deal with any of them herein,
and to prove, 1. That an uninterrupted ſucceſſion of right Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
is not of neceſſity to the being of the Miniſtry. 2. And if
it were, we have more to ſhew for it then they. If others ſtick on
this, let me tell them, that Magiſtracy is as truly from God as the
Miniſtry: And let ever a King on earth ſhew me an uninterrupted
ſucceſſion giving him title to his Crown, and I will ſhew him a more
undoubted ſucceſſion or title to my Miniſtry. But here's no room to
diſcuſs this Queſtion.</p>
            <p>9. Object. <hi>But you are Pariſh Prieſts, and no true Miniſters, becauſe
you have not true Churches. Anſw.</hi> All the Chriſtians in our Pariſhes
that conſent are our flock. And we undertake to prove the truth of
ſuch Churches, not only againſt ſcorn, but againſt all the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that can be brought.</p>
            <p>10. Object. <hi>But you have not the Spirit, and therefore are no true
Miniſters. Anſw.</hi> And how prove you that we have not the Spirit?
The approvers admit none but ſuch as they think have the Spirit.
He that is ſanctified hath the Spirit: Prove us unſanctified, and
we will reſign our Office. Object. <hi>You read your Sermons out of a
Paper; therefore you have not the Spirit. Anſw.</hi> A ſtrong Argument!
I pray you take ſeven years time to prove the conſequence. As wiſely
do the Quakers argue, that becauſe we uſe ſpectacles, or hour-glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
and Pulpits, we have not the Spirit. It is not want of your abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
that makes Miniſters uſe Notes: but it's a regard to the work
and good of the hearers. I uſe notes as much as any man, when I
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60958:9"/>
take pains: and as little as any man when I am lazy, or buſie, and
have not leiſure to prepare. It's eaſier to us to preach three Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
without Notes, then one with them. He is a ſimple preacher
that is not able to preach all day without preparation, if his ſtrength
would ſerve: eſpecially if he preach at your rates.</p>
            <p>11. <hi>Object.</hi> But the true Miniſtry is perſecuted: but ſo are not
you, but are perſecutors of others. <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. For our peſecuring
others, be ſo merciful as to prove it to us, that we may lament it.
If puniſhing wicked men and ſeducers be perſecuting, not only
<hi>Paul</hi> was ſuch, that wiſhed <hi>they were cut off that troubled the Galati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:</hi>
but God himſelf would be the greateſt of all perſecutors,
that will lay you in hell without repentance, and then you will wiſh
your old perſecution again. And if we be not perſecuted, What
means the reproaches of you and all the Drunkards and Malignants
about us? But I pray you, envy us not our lives and liberties, and
a little breathing time. Do you not read that [<hi>The Churches had
reſt throughout all Judaea and Galilee, and Samaria, and were edified,
and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy
Ghoſt were multiplied? Act.</hi> 9. 31.] Envy not a little proſperity to the
Church. Doth not <hi>Paul</hi> pray that the Goſpel <hi>may run and be glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and that we may be delivered from unreaſonable wicked men?</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi>
3. 1. Sometimes you can ſay that more glorious dayes are promiſed,
and that the Saints ſhall Rule the world. Unmerciful men! It is but
a while ago ſince we had our ſhare of ſufferings! Since that the
ſword hath hunted after us! Many of our Brethren are yet in
<hi>America,</hi> that were driven thither, at this time in <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi>
and <hi>Germany,</hi> and <hi>Savoy:</hi> Alas, what do our Brethren ſuffer in the
ſame cauſe and calling that we are in! And do you reproach us
with our mercies, if we be out of the Furnace but a little while, in
one corner of the world?</p>
            <p>Object. 12. <hi>You work no miracles to confirm your Doctrine. Anſw.</hi>
It is true: nor do we need: It is confirmed by miracles long ago.
If we brought a new Goſpel, or as the Papiſts, gave you not our
Doctrine on the credit of Scripture, but Scripture and all on our
own credit; then you might juſtly call for miracles to prove it. But
not when we have nothing to do but expound and apply a Doctrine
ſealed by miracles already.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again I ſay,</hi> Let any Prince on earth that queſtions our calling, ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>w
his Title to his Crown, or any Judge or Magiſtrate to his Office; and if
I ſhew not as good a Title to mine, let me be taken for a deceiver,
and not a Miniſter.</p>
            <p>Chriſtian Reader, as ever thou wouldeſt be <hi>ſanctified, confirmed</hi>
and <hi>ſaved,</hi> hold faſt to <hi>Chriſt, Scripture, Miniſtry,</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> and that
in the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Communion</hi> of <hi>Saints,</hi> and abhor the thoughts of
ſeparating them from each other.</p>
