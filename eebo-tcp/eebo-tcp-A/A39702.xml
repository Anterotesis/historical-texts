            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

to their several dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ocasions; which they then gratiously pleased to be inclined to hearken to, when the intervening of certain unexpected accidents, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted their ears from it, and me from farther thought thereof, till travelling into <hi>Italy</hi> I found that Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick I intended to introduce, excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly in vogue, and far advanced towards its perfection, which made me also more study the perfectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning my self therein, I mean Reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative Musick, being a compound of Musick and Poetry together, affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the mind and sense with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled delight, since if a thing but

            <p>Which Ballads (such was the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barism of insuing times) was in manner the sole relict of this divine
<pb facs="tcp:46817:5"/>
Science, untill <hi>Claudio Montanendo</hi> (in our Fathers days) principally, revived, it shall I say? or renewed it again by his admirable Skill (like another <hi>Prometheus</hi>) conjoyning in one body again the scattered limbs of <hi>Orpheus (Musick</hi> &amp; <hi>Poetry</hi>) which the ignorance of Poets and Musici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans had separated, and disseered: The Italian of all other Languages being most happy in it, in having their Tongue and <hi>Genius</hi> apted to it; the <hi>Spanish Genius</hi> not lying that way, though there Tongue be fit enough; nor our Tongue fit for it, though the <hi>Genius</hi> be not wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. Now the advantage the
<pb facs="tcp:46817:6"/>
Italian tongue hath of ours in it, is chiefly, as I conceive, in the strength of their words, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing composed more of the A, and O, (the sinewousness of a Tongue) as also the length of them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by each one is able to sustain it self; whereas our Language is so debile and weak, as our words die in a manner as soon as born, not being able scarcely to brook the air; En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding also so faintly and feebly for want of length, as they are forced to fall upon the next following for their support, whence comes the difficulty of pronouncing our words distinctly, or understanding our
<pb facs="tcp:46817:6"/>
Language when it is sung; which Inconvenience to Remedy, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded first, That your long dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses, and periods, were careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be avoided by us, in Recitative Musick, that so the often coming to a close, might make up in the full stop, our words want of length, and by severall reprises more strengthen them. Next, your cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious recerched words out of the way of common understanding, were carefully to be avoided, since the main Reason, why commonly we understand not so well when one sings, as when they write, is, because the delightsomness of the
<pb facs="tcp:46817:7"/>
Harmony, takes part of the Attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on away from the understandin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of the words; whence the words consequently are to be made as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile as may be, the better to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood.</p>
            <p>Where I cannot but note their want of judgment, who have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devoured to imitate at all parts in our language the Italian Recita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Musick, not considering, that the Musick of all Nations is cast in the mould of their language, whence there being great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betvvixt their verbosity, and our concised speech, it consequently follows, that that difference should
<pb facs="tcp:46817:7"/>
also be betwixt their Musick and Poetry, and ours.</p>
            <p>To conclude then, you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve in this composition of mine, a particular way of Recitative, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the Italian, as our lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage is different; insomuch, as though others, both in Italian and English, have composed upon this subject, I am confident yet, whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver peruses them wil absolve me of theft fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> either, so have I endevour'd short periods, and frequent rithmes, with words smooth and facile, such as most easily might enter into the mind, and be digested by the understanding; studying nothing so
<pb facs="tcp:46817:8"/>
much, as that my words should not at all appear studious, your <hi>diffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les nugae,</hi> or difficil toyes, being in nothing more ridiculous than in this; with finally a pathetickness in lieu of all other Rhetorick, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving observ'd, that your Italian O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators, with an Oh or a <hi>Misericordia,</hi> do more move their Auditors to tears and compunction, than with all their curious Rhetorick besides.</p>
            <p>Of the composition of the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick, I shall defer to speak, untill the publishing of it, as shortly I intend to do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with a Treatise of the Air of Musick, and of this in particular, to shew, that as no composition seems
<pb facs="tcp:46817:8"/>
more easy to the ignorant than it, so none is more hard to those who understand it.</p>
            <p>Hoping that I shall not appear to have ill merited of my Country, in studying Musick and Concord, whilst others study only discord &amp; dissention; and in striving to delight ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
