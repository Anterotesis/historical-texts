         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

hath a Parſonage appropriate in <hi>D.</hi> which is
diſcharged of payment of Tithes, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the Abbot purchaſeth part of the lands in
the ſame Town and Pariſh where the Parſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
is: That this land ſo purchaſed is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
of Tithes in the hands of the Abbot;
For the Tithes were ſuſpended, during the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
of the Abbot, in his own hands. But after that, the Abby was
ſurrendred into the hands of the King, Anno 30. <hi>H.</hi> 8. And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the ſame poſſeſſions &amp;c. were given to King <hi>H.</hi> 8. by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of 31. <hi>H.</hi> 8. cap. 13. as they were in the hands of the Abbot.
The queſtion was, Whether the Land ſo purchaſed by the Abbot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the ſurrender, were diſcharged of payment of Tithes by the
Statute, or not. And the opinion of Mr. <hi>Plowden</hi> was, That they
were not diſcharged of Tithes by the Statute: For that no lands are
diſcharged by the Statute, but ſuch lands as were lawfully diſcharged
in right, by compoſition, or other lawfull thing. And the lands in
this caſe were not diſcharged in right, but ſuſpended during the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
of the Abbot, in his own hands. And ſo hee ſaid it is, when
the Land is purchaſed by one, and the Parſonage by another, the
right of Tithes is revived, and the lands charged as before the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe
of the Abbot. And ſo, he ſaid, it had been adjudged.</p>

            <p>A Man makes a Leaſe for Life, and afterwards makes a Leaſe unto

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40982:6"/>
The Adminiſtrators and the Tenant for life joyn in the
purchaſe of the Fee-ſimple: Two queſtions were moved; The firſt
was, Whether the Fee were executed in the Tenant for life for any
part? 2. Whether the Term were gone in part, or in all? And
the opinion of the Juſtices was, That the Fee was executed for a
moitie. <hi>Manwood.</hi> If the Land be to one for life, the Remainder
for yeers, the Remainder to the firſt Tenant for life in Fee, there the
Fee is executed; ſo as if he loſe by default, he ſhall have a Writ of
Right, and not <hi>Quod ei deforceat;</hi> for the term ſhall be no impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that the Fee ſhall not be executed: As a man may make a leaſe
to begin after his death, it is good, and the Leſſor hath Fee in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion,
and his wife ſhall be endowed after the Leaſe. And I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
in the principall caſe, That the term ſhall not be extinct; for
that it is not a term, but <hi>intereſſe termini,</hi> which cannot be granted
nor ſurrendred: <hi>Mounſon.</hi> If he had had the term in his own right,
then by the purchaſe of the Fee, the Term ſhould be extinct. But
here he hath it in the right of another as Adminiſtrator. <hi>Dyer.</hi> If an
Executor hath a term, and purchaſeth the Fee, the term is determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
So, if a woman hath a term, and takes an husband who pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſeth
the Fee, the term is extinct. <hi>Manwood.</hi> The Law may be
ſo in ſuch caſe, becauſe the Husband hath done an act which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyes
the term, viz. the purchaſe. But if the woman had enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>married
with him in the Reverſion, there the term ſhould not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed;
for the Husband hath not done any act to deſtroy the
term; But the marriage is the act of Law. <hi>Dyer.</hi> That difference
hath ſome colour. But I conceive, in the firſt caſe, That they are
Tenants in common of the Fee. <hi>Manwood.</hi> The Caſe is a good point
in law. But I conceive the opinion of <hi>Manwood</hi> was, That if a Leaſe
for yeares were to begin after the death, ſurrender, forfeiture or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
of the firſt leaſe for yeares, that it ſhall not begin in that
part, for then perhaps the term in that part ſhall be ended, before
the other ſhould begin.</p>

            <p>A Man ſeiſed of Copyhold land deſcendable to the youngeſt Son
by Cuſtome; and of other Lands deſcendable to the eldeſt Son

That if the Leſſor, his wife and his heirs will have back the land,
That then upon a yeers warning given by the Leſſor, his wife or his

of the cuſtomary Land deſcends to the younger ſon, and the other
to the eldeſt, who granteth it to the younger; and he gives a yeers
warning according to the Covenant. <hi>Fenner.</hi> The intereſt of the
term is not determined, becauſe a ſpeciall heir, as the youngeſt ſon
is, is not comprehended under the word [Heir;] but the heir at
common Law, is the perſon who is to give the warning to avoid the
eſtate by the meaning of the Covenant. But <hi>Manwood</hi> and <hi>Mounſon,</hi>
Juſtices, were cleer of opinion, That the intereſt of the term for a
moity is avoyded; for the Condition, although it be an entire thing,
by the Deſcent, which is the act of Law, is divided and apportioned;
and the warning of any of them ſhall defeat the eſtate for a moity,
becauſe to him the moity of the Condition doth belong: But for
the other moity, he ſhall not take advantage by the warning, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that the warning is by the words of the Condition appointed to
be done by the Leſſor, his wife, or his heirs: And in that clauſe of
the Deed the Aſſignee is not contained. And they agreed, That
if a Feoffment of lands in Borough-Engliſh be made upon conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
That the heir at common Law ſhall take advantage of it. And
<hi>Manwood</hi> ſaid, that hee would put another queſtion, Whether the

            <p>THis Caſe was moved by Serjeant <hi>Periam;</hi> That if a Parſon
hath Common appendant to his Parſonage, out of the lands of
an Abby, and afterwards the Abbot hath the Parſonage appropriated
to him and his Succeſſors: Whether the Common be extinct? <hi>Dyer,</hi>
That it is: Becauſe he hath as high an eſtate in the Common as he
hath in the Land. As in the caſe of 2 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 19. where it is holden,
That if a Prior hath an Annuity out of a Parſonage, and afterwards
purchaſeth the Advowſon, and then obtains an Appropriation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
that the Annuity is extinct. But <hi>Windham</hi> and <hi>Meade</hi> Juſtices,
conceived, That the Abbot hath not as perdurable eſtate in the one
as in the other; for the Parſonage may be diſappropriated, and then
the Parſon ſhall have the Common again. As if a man hath a Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norie
in fee, and afterwards Lands deſcend to him on the part of the
Mother; in that caſe the Seignory is not extinguiſhed, but ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded:
For if the Lord to whom the Land deſcends dies without
iſſue, the Seignorie ſhall go to the heir on the part of the Father,
and the Tenancy to the heir on the part of the Mother; And yet the
Father had as high an eſtate in the Tenancy as in the Seignory. And
in 21 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 2. Where an Aſſize of Nuſance was brought for ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of a way which the plaintif ought to have to his Mill: The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant
did alledg unity of poſſeſſion of the Land, and of the Mill in
W. and demanded Judgment, if &amp;c. The plaintif ſaid, that after
that, W. had two daughters, and died ſeiſed; and the Mill was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted
to one of them in partition, and the Land to the other, and the
way was reſerved to her who had the Mill: And the Aſſize was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded.
And ſo by the partition the way was revived, and appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant

            <p>A Man makes a Feoffment in Fee of a Manor, to the uſe of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
and his Wife, and his heirs: In which Manor there are
Underwoods uſually to be cut every one and twenty yeers; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
the Husband ſuffers the wood to grow five and twenty yeers,
and afterwards hee dieth. The queſtion was, Whether the Wife,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40982:7"/>
being Tenant for life, might cut that Underwood? And it was moved,
What ſhall be ſaid ſeaſonable Underwood, that a Termor or Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
for life might cut? <hi>Dyer</hi> Chief Juſtice, and all the other Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices
held, That a Termor or Tenant for life, might cut all Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood
which had been uſually cut within twenty yeers. In 11. <hi>H.
6.</hi> 1. Iſſue was taken, If they were of the age of twenty yeers, or
no. But in the Wood-Countries they may fell ſeaſonable wood
which is called <hi>Sylva caedua,</hi> at ſix and twenty, eight and twenty,
thirty years, by the cuſtome of the Country. And ſo the Uſage
makes the Law in ſeverall Countries. And ſo it is holden in the
books of 11. <hi>H.</hi> 6. and 4. E. 6. But they agreed, That the cutting
of Oakes of the age of eight yeers, or ten years, is Waſte. But by
<hi>Meade</hi> Juſtice, the cutting of Hornbeams, Haſels, Willows, or Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
of the age of forty yeares, is no Waſte, becauſe at no time they
will be Timber. Another queſtion which was moved was, That at
the time of the Feoffment it was ſeaſonable Wood, and but of the
growth of fourteen or fifteen yeers: If this ſuffering of the Husband
of it to grow to 25 years, during the Coverture, ſhould bind the Wife,
ſo as ſhe cannot cut the Woods. <hi>Gaudy</hi> Serjeant ſaid, That it ſhould
not bind the Wife; For if a Warranty deſcend upon a Feme Covert,
it ſhall not bind her. So if a man ſeized of Land in the Right of his
Wife be diſſeiſed, and a Deſcent be caſt during the Coverture, it
ſhall not bind the Wife, but that ſhe may enter after the death of
the Husband: But by <hi>Dyer</hi> Chief Juſtice, and all the other Juſtices,
This Permiſſion of the Husband ſhall bind the Wife, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Coverture; for that the time is limited by the Law, which
cannot be altered, if it be not the cuſtome of the Country. As in
the caſe of 17. <hi>E.</hi> 3. Where a man makes a Leaſe for years, and
grants that the Leſſee ſhall have as great commoditie of the Land
as hee might have. Notwithſtanding theſe words, he cannot dig
the land for a Mine of Cole or Stone; becauſe that the Law for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids
him to dig the land. So in the principall Caſe, The Wife can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
fell the Wood, notwithſtanding that at the time of her eſtate
ſhe might; and afterwards by the permiſſion of the Husband, during
the coverture; the time is incurred, ſo as ſhe cannot fell it, becauſe
the Law doth appoint a time, which if it be not felled before ſuch
time, that it ſhall not be felled by a Termor, or a Tenant for life, but
it ſhall be Waſte.</p>

<hi>Dyer,</hi> That a Garden is a thing which ought to be demanded by
the ſame name in all <hi>Precipes;</hi> as the Regiſter and <hi>Fitz. N. Brevium</hi> is.
And this Action is greater then an Action of Treſpaſſe, becauſe by
Recovery in this Action, he ſhall be put into Poſſeſſion. But <hi>Meade</hi>
and <hi>Windham</hi> Juſtices, contrary: And they agreed, that in all reall
Actions, a Garden ſhall be demanded by the name <hi>Gardinum;</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
not. But this Action of <hi>Ejectione firme</hi> is in the nature of Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe;

doth; or for to declare of the Ejectment of a Garden; for a Garden
may be uſed at one time for a Garden; and at another time be plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

of pleading had been, if he had declared that he was ejected of a

moved, That by this deed, the two later Feoffees ſhould be ſeized to
the uſe of the right Heirs of the body of the Son begotten, after the
death of the Husband, Wife, and the Son. But it was holden by all
the Juſtices, That the ſecond Feoffees had not the Fee, becauſe by

and one Fee-Simple cannot depend upon another Fee-Simple:
Notwithſtanding, that after the determination of the former uſes for

and that the words, That the ſecond Feoffees ſhould be ſeized,
ſhould be void. But <hi>Dyer</hi> Chief Juſtice, and the other Juſtices, were

notwithſtanding that, the Reverſion ſhall not paſſe, becauſe [Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain

In conſideration of which, <hi>I. D.</hi> by the ſame Indenture, did Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with the ſaid <hi>I. S.</hi> to pay him 100 li. The Queſtion is, If <hi>I. S.</hi>
will not make the Feoffment, whether <hi>I. D.</hi> be bound to pay the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney?
It was holden by the Lord <hi>Dyer</hi> Chief Juſtice, and Juſtice <hi>Mead,</hi>
That he is not, becauſe the money is Covenanted to be paid Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
to have the Feoffment made; and therefore if he will not make
the Feoffment, he ſhall not have the money. As if I Covenant with
one, That I will marry his Daughter; and he Covenants with me,
That for the ſame cauſe, he will make an Eſtate to me and his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and to the Heirs of our two bodies begotten, of his Manor of

me, To make an Eſtate to me and his Daughter; if I marry another
woman, or if the Daughter marryeth another man, yet I ſhall have an
Action of Covenant to compell him to make the Eſtate, becauſe in
this later Caſe, the Covenant was made for another Cauſe. And
this difference was ſo taken by the whole Court, 15 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 10. So if <hi>A.</hi>
grant to <hi>B.</hi> all the ancient Pale, and for that, <hi>B.</hi> grants, That he
will make a new Pale; it is holden in 15. E. 4. 4. by <hi>Cateſby,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by <hi>Littleton,</hi> That if <hi>B.</hi> cannot have the ancient Pale, that he
ſhall be excuſed from making the new Pale. But if two things are
given by two Perſons, one for the other, there if one of them detain
the one, the other cannot detain the other, as is 9 E. 4. 20. and
15 E. 4. 2. It is holden, That if one grant Tithes in Fee, by one Deed,
and by the ſame Deed, for the ſame Grant, the Grantee grant to the
ſame Perſon an Annuity of 20 li; That if the Grantor of the Tithes,
enter into the Tithes, yet the Grantee cannot detaine the Annuity,
becauſe the grant of the Tithes is executed in him, and he may have
an Action for them, if the other enter upon them. But in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall

grants his Remainder by Fine: Whether the Conuſee of the
Fine may enter upon the Tenant for life, and avoid his Leaſe, was the
queſtion. <hi>Fenner</hi> Serjeant, Hee cannot: becauſe when a Free-hold
is given by Livery, it cannot be defeated without Entrie, As, If a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
make a Leaſe for life, rendring rent, and dieth, and his ſucceſſor
accept the rent, the leaſe is affirmed, as it is holden in 11. <hi>E.</hi> 3. and
<hi>18. E.</hi> 4. The Caſe was, That a man made a Leaſe for life, the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in Fee; Tenant for life granted over his eſtate: and then a <hi>Forme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
was brought againſt the Grantee, and then the firſt Tenant for
life died: And by all the Juſtices (except <hi>Littleton,</hi> and divers Serjeants)
the Writ ſhall not abate, if he in the Remainder hath not entred. So
in the principall caſe, When he had made a Leaſe for life, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
died without iſſue, living the Tenant for life,; his eſtate is not
defeated before entrie of him in the Remainder: And then, when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
entrie, he in the Remainder grants his Remainder, the Grantee
ſhall have it but as a Remainder; for ſo is his grant: and ſo the eſtate
of Tenant for life which was but voidable, is made good: And ſo was it
holden by <hi>Windham</hi> and <hi>Periam,</hi> Juſtices: but <hi>Meade,</hi> and <hi>Dyer</hi> Chief
Juſtice did conceive, that by the death of Tenant in taile without iſſue,
his Leaſe made to him for life, was void, and not voidable; becauſe by
the death of Tenant in tail, his eſtate, out of which the eſtate of the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant

life is determined alſo; <hi>Et ceſſante cauſâ ceſſat effectus.</hi> And <hi>Meade</hi>

            <p>IT was found upon a ſpeciall verdict in an Action of Treſpaſs, that
the place where, &amp;c. was Copy-hold land: And that the Cuſtome
is, That <hi>quaelibet foemina viro cooperta poterit</hi> deviſe lands whereof ſhe is
ſeiſed in Fee, according to the cuſtome of the Manor, to her Husband,
and ſurrender it in the preſence of the Reeve and ſix other perſons.
And that <hi>I. S.</hi> was ſeiſed of the land, where, &amp;c. and had iſſue two
Daughters, and died, and that they married husbands; and that one
of them deviſed her part to her husband by Will in writing, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of the Reeve and ſix other perſons: and afterwards at another
day ſhee ſurrendred to the Husband, and he was admitted; and ſhe
died, and her Husband continued the poſſeſſion. And the Husband
of the other Daughter brought an Action of Treſpaſſe. <hi>Rodes</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant,
The Cuſtome is not good, neither for the Surrender, nor for the
Will, for two cauſes: One; for the uncertainty of what eſtate ſhee
might make a Deviſe, and becauſe it is againſt reaſon, that the Wife
ſhould ſurrender to the Husband. Where the Cuſtome ſhall not be
good, if it be uncertain, he vouched 13. <hi>E. 3. Fitz. Dum fuit infra
aetatem.</hi> 3. The Tenant ſaith, that the lands are in <hi>Dorſet,</hi> where the
Cuſtome is, that an Enfant may make a Grant or Feoffment, when he
can number twelve pence. And it was holden, that becauſe it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
when he can ſo do, the Cuſtome is not good. 19. <hi>E.</hi> 2. in a
Raviſhment of Ward, the defendant pleaded, that the cuſtome is, that
when the Enfant can meaſure an ell of cloth, or tell twelve pence, as
before, that he ſhould be out of Ward: and it is holden no good cuſtom
for the cauſe aforeſaid. 22. <hi>H. 6. 51. a.</hi> there a man preſcribed, That
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40982:12"/>
the Lord of <hi>D.</hi> had uſed to have Common for him and all his Tenants;
And becauſe it is not ſhewed, what Lord; whether the Lord mediate
or immediate, it is adjudged no good cuſtome. And as to the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render,
it is againſt reaſon, that the Wife ſhould give to the Husband;
for a Wife hath not any Will but the Will of her Husband: For if
the Husband ſeiſed in the right of his Wife, make a Feoffment in Fee,
and the Wife being upon the land, doth diſagree unto it, ſaying, that
ſhee will never depart with it during her life; yet the Feoffment is
good, and ſhall binde during the life of the Husband, as it is holden
in 21. <hi>E.</hi> 3. And therefore it is holden in 3. <hi>E. 3. Tit. Deviſe, Br.</hi> 43.
That a Feme covert cannot deviſe to her Husband; for that ſhould be
the Act of the Husband to convey the land to himſelf. And in the old
<hi>Natura Brevium,</hi> in the Additions of <hi>Ex gravi quaerela,</hi> it is holden
ſo accordingly. And the Caſe in 29. <hi>E.</hi> 3. differs much from this
Caſe: For there a woman ſeiſed of lands deviſable, took an Husband,
and had iſſue; and deviſed the lands to the Husband for his life, and
died, and a Writ of Waſte was brought againſt him as Tenant by the
Courteſie; and it was holden that it did lie, and that he is not in by
the Deviſe; for the reaſon there is, becauſe he was in before by the
Courteſie: But as I conceive, that Caſe will diſprove the Surrender; for
in as much as he had it in the Right of his wife, he could not take it in
his own Right. Alſo he took another Exception in the principal Caſe,
becauſe that the wife was not examined upon the Surrender; but none
of the Juſtices ſpake to that Exception: but when the Record was
viewed, it appeared, that it was ſo pleaded: Further, He ſaid, That the
deviſe was void by the Statute of 34. <hi>H. 8. Cap.</hi> 5. where it is ſaid, It is
enacted, That Wills and Teſtaments made of any Lands, Tenements, &amp;c.
by women Coverts, or &amp;c. ſhall not be taken to be good, or effectual in
Law. And he ſaid, That this Statute doth extend to cuſtomary Lands;
And as to that all the Juſtices did agree, That it is not within the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute.
And as to the Statute of Limitations, <hi>And<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rſon</hi> chief Juſtice ſaid,
That if a Leaſe for years, which perhaps will not indure ſixty years,
ſhall be taken ſtrong, this ſhall. <hi>Anderſon</hi> moved, That if the Lord

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> there
ought to be a Right in Fact: And although it be by concluſion, it is
not ſufficient, for that the Jury or Judge are not eſtopped or concluded:
And he conceived, That if Tenant at Will make a Leaſe for years, that
it is no good leaſe betwixt him and the Leſſor; but that he may well
plead, that he had nothing in the land: <hi>Meade</hi> contrary; but they
both agreed, That the Book of 14. <hi>E.</hi> 4. which ſaith, That if Tenant at
Will make a leaſe for years, that he ſhall be a Diſſeiſor, is not Law.
<hi>Anderſon</hi> ſaid, That the preſcription in the principal Caſe was not
good, for it is <hi>Quod quaelibet foemina viro cooperta poterit, &amp;c.</hi> and it
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40982:13"/>
ought to be, that feme Coverts <hi>poſſunt,</hi> and by the Cuſtome have uſed to
deviſe to the husband, and therefore the preſcription is not good, that
<hi>Poteſt ponere retes</hi> upon the land of another upon the Cuſtome of the
Sea; for preſcription muſt be in a thing done: alſo by him the deviſe is
not good according to the Cuſtome, for that is, that ſhe may deviſe
and ſurrender; and that ought to be all at one time, and that in the
preſence of the <hi>Reeve</hi> and ſix other perſons, as well as the Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer;
and the words of a Cuſtome ſhall be ſo far performed as they
may be. <hi>Meade</hi> contrary: And that theſe Witneſſes ſhall be referred
to the ſurrender onely, for a deviſe may be without Witneſſes. And he
ſaid, that ſometimes the latter clauſe ſhall not refer to all the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
matter, but unto the latter onely, as 7. <hi>H.</hi> 7. is, Where a <hi>Praecipe</hi>
was brought of lands in <hi>A. B.</hi> and <hi>C. in Inſula de Ely:</hi> the Clauſe
<hi>(in Inſula de Ely)</hi> is referred onely to <hi>C.</hi> And it was ſaid, That if in

            <p>THis Caſe was moved by Serjant <hi>Gawdy. Thomas Heigham</hi> had an
hundred Acres of lands, called <hi>Jacks,</hi> uſually occupied with a
houſe; and he leaſed the houſe and forty Acres, parcel of the ſaid hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Acres, to <hi>I. S.</hi> for life, and reſerved the other to himſelf, and
made his Will, by which he doth deviſe the houſe and all his lands, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Jacks,</hi> now in the occupation of <hi>I. S.</hi> to his wife for life; and
that after her deceaſe, the remainder of that, and all his other lands
pertaining to <hi>Jacks,</hi> to <hi>R.</hi> who was his ſecond ſon; Whether the wife
ſhall have that of which her husband died ſeiſed for her life, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the eldeſt ſon ſhould have it, and what eſtate he ſhall have in it.
<hi>Meade.</hi> The wife ſhall not have it; for, becauſe that he hath expreſſed
his Will that the wife ſhall have part, it ſhall not be taken by implica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that ſhe ſhall have the whole or the other part, for then he would
have deviſed the ſame to her; And therefore it hath been adjudged in
this Court betwixt <hi>Glover</hi> and <hi>Tracy;</hi> That if Lands be deviſed to one
and his heirs males; and if he die without heirs of his body, that then
the land ſhall remain over, that he had no greater eſtate then to him
and his ſpecial heirs, <hi>viz.</hi> heirs Males: and the reaſon was, becauſe the
Will took effect by the firſt words. <hi>Anderſon</hi> Chief Juſtice; It was hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
in the time of <hi>Brown,</hi> That if lands were deviſed to one after the
death of his wife, that the wife ſhould have for life: but if a man ſeiſed
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40982:13"/>
of two Acres, deviſeth one unto his wife; and that <hi>I. S.</hi> ſhall have the
other after the death of the wife, ſhe takes nothing in that Acre for the
Cauſe aforeſaid: For the ſecond matter, If the Reverſion ſhall paſs
after the death of the wife to the ſecond ſon; we are to conſider what
ſhall be ſaid land uſually occupied with the other, and that is the land
leaſed with it. But this land is not now leaſed with it, and therefore it
cannot paſs. <hi>Windham.</hi> The ſecond ſon ſhall have the Reverſion; for
although it doth not paſs by theſe words, Uſualy Occupied; (as <hi>Anderſon</hi>
held) yet becauſe the deviſe cannot take other effect, and it appeareth
that his intent was to paſs the land, the yonger ſon ſhall have it <hi>Ander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
Jacks</hi> is the intire name of the houſe and lands; And that word
when it hath reference unto an intire thing called <hi>Jacks,</hi> and is known
by the name of Jacks, ſhall paſs to the ſecond ſon; for words are as we
ſhall conſtrue them: And therefore, If a man hath land called <hi>Mannor
of Dale,</hi> and he deviſeth his <hi>Mannor of Dale</hi> to one, the land ſhall paſs,
although it be not a Mannor: And if I be known by the name of
<hi>Edward Williamſon;</hi> where my name is <hi>Edward Anderſon,</hi> and lands are
given unto me by the name of <hi>Edward Williamſon;</hi> the ſame is a good

            <p>NOte, by <hi>Anderſon</hi> Chief Juſtice, and <hi>Periam</hi> Juſtice. If a man
ſeiſed of any entrie Franchiſes, as to have goods of Felons with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
ſuch a Hundred, or Mannor; or goods of Outlaws, Waifes, Strares,
&amp;c. which are cauſual; There are not Inheritances deviſeable by the
Statute of 32. <hi>H.</hi> 8. for they are not of any yearly value, and peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
no profit ſhall be to the Lord for three or four years, or perhaps
for a longer time. And ſuch a thing which is deviſeable ought to be of
annual value, as appeareth by the words of the Statute. And alſo they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed,
that the ſaid Franchiſes could not be divided; and therefore if they
deſcend to two coparceners, no partition can be made of them. And the
words of the Statute of 32. <hi>H.</hi> 8. are, That it ſhall be lawful, &amp;c. to diviſe
two parts, &amp;c. and then a thing which canot be divided, is not diviſeable.
And they ſaid, That if a man had three Manors, and in each of the three
ſuch Liberties, and every Manor is of equal value, that yet he cannot
deviſe one Mannor and the Liberties which he hath to it, <hi>Cauſá, quâ

They agreed, That the Lord <hi>Mountjoy</hi> could not devide the ſaid
Intereſt, <hi>viz.</hi> to grant to one to digg within a parcel of the ſaid Waſte.
And they alſo agreed, That notwithſtanding that Grant, That <hi>Brown,</hi>
his Heirs and Aſſigns, owners of the Soile, might digg there alſo, like
to the Caſe of Common <hi>Sans</hi> number. The Caſe went further, That
the Lord <hi>Mountjoy</hi> had deviſed this Intereſt to one <hi>Laicott</hi> for one and
twenty years, and that <hi>Laicott</hi> aſſigned the ſame over to two other
men: And whether this Aſſignment were good or not, was the Queſtion;
foraſmuch that if the Aſſignement might be good to them, it might
be to twenty; and that might be a ſurcharge to the Tenant of

was good; but that the two aſſignees could not work ſeverally, but

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40982:14"/>
that notwithſtanding that, the Frankmarriage was good. Alſo
a gift in Frankmarriage after the eſpouſals, is good, as it was holden by
all the Juſtices. And ſee <hi>Fitz. Tit. Taile 4. E.</hi> 3. and 2. <hi>H. 3. Dower</hi> 199.
And he ſaid, That a gift in Frankmarriage before the Stat. of <hi>Donis,</hi> &amp;c.
was a Feeſimple, but now it is but a ſpecial tail: and if it ſhould not be in
law a gift in Frankmarriage, then the Husband and Wife have an eſtate
but for their lives; for they cannot have an eſtate taile, for that there
are not words of limitation of ſuch eſtate in the gift. And hee cited
<hi>4. E.</hi> 3. and 45. <hi>E.</hi> 3. 20. to prove his opinion: and hee much relyed
upon the intent of the Donor, which ought to be obſerved in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of ſuch Gifts according to the Statute. And becauſe the
<hi>Habendum</hi> is repugnant to the premiſſes, and would deſtroy the Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marriage,
it is void, and the premiſſes ſhall ſtand good: and to prove
that, he cited 9. <hi>E. 3. 13. E. 1. 32. E. 1. Tit. Taile, 25. 3. H.</hi> 4. by <hi>Hill.</hi>
And he took this difference; Where a Remainder is limited upon a
Gift in Frankmarriage to a ſtranger, and where it is limited to one of
the Donees; for in the firſt caſe, the Remainder is good for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of the ſtranger; but in the ſecond caſe it is void. And he ſaid,
that if a Rent be reſerved upon ſuch a Gift, that it ſhould be void du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the four degrees, but afterwards the Reſervation ſhould be good.
And if the Donor grant the Reverſion over, and the Donee in Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marriage
attourn, now he ſhall pay rent to the Grantee; for by <hi>Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleton,</hi>
he hath loſt the Priviledg of Frankmarriage, viz. the Aquitall;

Alſo if a man give lands to another <hi>&amp; ſemini ſuo,</hi> it is good; 45.
<hi>E. 3: Statham, taile.</hi> If it be not Frankmarriage, yet it is a good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
in taile. 19. <hi>Aſſ</hi> Land was given to Husband and Wife in Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marriage,
<hi>infra annos nubiles,</hi> and afterwards they are divorced; the
Wife hath an eſtate in taile. <hi>Meade</hi> Juſtice did agree with <hi>Windham,</hi>
and ſaid, That although there be not any Tenure, nor any Aquitall,
yet it may be a good Frankmarriage; as if a Rent, Common, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
be given in Frankmarriage, it is good; and yet there is not
any Tenure nor aquitall. <hi>Dyer</hi> Chief Juſtice conceived, That it is
not Frankmarriage; becauſe that the uſuall words in ſuch Gifts are
not obſerved: for he ſaid, that the gift ought to be <hi>in liberum Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagium,</hi>
and not <hi>Joannae filiae ſuae;</hi> for that is not the uſuall form of
the words: And he ſaid, That if the word <hi>[Liberum]</hi> be omitted,
that it is not Frankmarriage; for that he ſaid, is as it were a Maxime:
and therefore the uſuall words ought to be obſerved. And by the ſame
reaſon ſuch a Gift cannot be with a man, but ought to be with a
woman: alſo ſuch a Gift ought to be with one of the blood of the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:40982:15"/>
Donor, who by poſſibilitie might be his Heir. Alſo there ought to
be a Tenure betwixt the Donor and Donee, and alſo an Aquitall. And
if theſe grounds and ceremonies be not obſerved, it is not Frankmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.
Alſo if it once take effect as a Frankmarriage, and afterwards
the Donor granteth the Reverſion over, or if the Reverſion doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
to the Donees, yet it ſhall not be utterly deſtroyed, but ſhall
remaine as an eſtate taile, and not as an eſtate for life; becauſe it
once took effect in the Donees and their iſſues as a Frankmarriage,
<hi>31. E. 1. taile</hi> 116. If a man give lands in Frankmarriage, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
to the Donees and the heirs of their bodies; yet it is a good
Frankmarriage. And if a man give Lands in Frankmarriage, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
to another in taile, it ſhall not deſtroy the Frankmarriage,
becauſe that the Donor hath the Reverſion in Fee in himſelf, and the
Donees ſhall hold of him, and not of him in the Remainder in taile;
but if the Remainder had been limited to another in Fee ſimple, then
it had been otherwiſe. Alſo if the Donor grant the Services of the
Donees in Frankmarriage, reſerving the Reverſion to himſelf, it is no
good Grant, although that the Donees attourne; for that the Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are incident to the Reverſion: but if he grant the Reverſion, then
they do paſſe. And he concluded, That the Husband had the whole,
and that the Wife had nothing: for ſhe was no purchaſer of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes,
becauſe that the Gift did not take effect as a gift in Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mariage:
And he ſaid, that he doth not conſtrue it ſo by the intent of
the Gift; for here is an expreſſe limitation of the Fee to the Husband
and his heirs, which ſhall not be contradicted by any intendment; for
an Intendment ought to give way to an expreſſe Limitation, as a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration

afterwards this yeer it was adjudged, that it was not a Frankmarriage,
nor a Gift in taile, but that it was a Fee ſimple. And the Juſtices ſaid,
that although the old books are, That where it takes not effect as a
Frankmarriage, that yet it ſhall take effect as an eſtate taile, thoſe
Books are againſt Law. But they agreed, That where once the Gift
doth take effect as a Frankmarriage, that by matter <hi>ex poſt facto,</hi> it
might be turned to an eſtate in taile.</p>

<hi>E.</hi> 4 the laſt caſe is the ſame caſe; where the Avowry is made for 12

becauſe they agree in the Services. <hi>Walmeſley,</hi> He ſhall
have the traverſe for the miſchief which otherwiſe would follow: for
if he ſhould traverſe the ſeiſin, thereby he ſhould confeſſe the Tenure.
<hi>Periam conceſſit,</hi> and ſaid, That the difference which is commonly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in our Books, is, That where they agree in the Tenure, there the
Seiſin is traverſable; but where they do not agree in the Tenure, there
the Tenure is traverſable. So is 26. <hi>H. 8. 6. 7. E. 4. 27. 12. E. 4. 7.
20. E.</hi> 4. 16. And he conceived here, that the payment at two dayes
doth alter the tenure; ſo as now it is another tenure then before. Alſo
he ſaid, That if Wh. acre and Bl. acre be adjoyning, and are holden
the one of <hi>I. S.</hi> and the other of <hi>I. D.</hi> and <hi>I. S.</hi> diſtrein and avow for

It is ſaid by <hi>Brian,</hi> That if avowry be made for a tenure of two acres
by twenty ſhillings, and the Plaintiffe ſaith, that he holdeth theſe two

the two acres by twenty ſhillings: that that is good, for that he cannot

            <p>
               <hi>HEnry Savell</hi> Leſſee for years of the Manor of M. grants the ſame
Manor, <hi>Habendum</hi> for ſo many years, which ſhould be to come
after his death, to <hi>Cordell</hi> Maſter of the Rolls, if <hi>Dorothy</hi> his Wife ſo
long ſhould live: And afterward <hi>Henry Savell,</hi> and he in the Reverſion
levied a Fine. The Caſe went by many Conveyances further. But two
points were here moved: 1. If it were a good Grant for ſo many yeers,
&amp;c. <hi>Shuttleworth</hi> argued that it was. But <hi>Cooke</hi> contrary. And <hi>Cooke</hi>
ſaid to that which hath been ſaid, That Leaſes which have uncertain
beginning, may be by act of matter <hi>ex poſt facto,</hi> made certain, and ſo
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:40982:17"/>
good. As a leaſe for ſo many years as <hi>I. S.</hi> ſhall name; if he name, it is
a certain leaſe: but if the Leſſor die before <hi>I. S.</hi> name, and after hee
name, all is void, as it is in the Commentaries put by <hi>Weſton,</hi> and granted
by <hi>Dyer</hi> 273. And the reaſon is, that it behoves that the intereſt paſſe
out of the Leſſor during his life, and the Deed ought to have its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
in the life of the Leſſor. But in our caſe here, the Leſſor or
Grantor is dead before the certaintie of the beginning is known, and
before any perfection of intereſt out of him: and therefore the reaſon
in the common caſe, 40 <hi>Aſſ.</hi> and 16. <hi>E.</hi> 3. that there behoveth to be
Attornment in the life of the Leſſor, proves our caſe: for the reaſon
of that is, that it behoveth that ſome intereſt paſſe out of the Leſſor
or Grantor during his life; and that perfection of his Grant be
in his life or elſe the Grant is void. <hi>Vide 31. E. 3. alb.</hi> 20. and 33.
<hi>E. 3. Confirmation</hi> 22. If the Chapter confirm the Grant of the Biſhop
after his death, it is void; for it ought to have perfection in the life of
the Biſhop, otherwiſe it is void. And upon that reaſon is the caſe put
by <hi>Popham, Com. 520. b.</hi> That where a man grants all his term which
ſhall be to come after his death; that it is a void Grant, becauſe no
intereſt paſſeth during the life of the Grantor. And to this purpoſe
is 7. <hi>E. 6. Br. Leaſes. 66. Temps. H.</hi> 8. 339. If a man will take by Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
within the view, it behoves the Feoffee to enter during the life of
the Feoffor: and yet that is a more ſtrong caſe; for by the Livery,
being a ceremony of the Law, it is preſumed that the land paſſed; and
yet there ought to be an entry to fortifie the Grant, otherwiſe it is
void. The ſecond point was, If by the Fine levyed, the poſſibilitie aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
as the right of poſſeſſion of the term did paſſe: And I conceive,
that it doth; therefore we ſee in many caſes, a man may grant by his
Deed a poſſibility to come. As 19. <hi>H.</hi> 7. 1. where a man ſeiſed in the
right of his Wife, made a Feoffment in ſee, and after they had iſſue, and
the Wife died; that he ſhould not be Tenant by the Courteſie, and yet
the Wife was remitted: but by his own Grant he had granted from him
the poſſibility he might have had to be Tenant by the courteſie. And
here, If <hi>Cordell</hi> had entered, and made a Feoffment in fee, or levied a Fine,
the poſſibility which he had to have the term, had been cleerly gone. 39.
<hi>H.</hi> 6. 43. If I diſſeiſe my Eather, and make a Feoffment in fee, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
my Father dieth; although that a new Right deſcends unto me,
yet I ſhall be barred of this poſſibilitie which I had at the time of the
Grant: But otherwiſe it had been, if this diſcontinuance or grant had
been defeated by entry or otherwiſe, in my life, by my Father or any
other; in that caſe I may ſhew the ſpeciall matter, as 15. <hi>E.</hi> 4. 5. is,
and ſo avoid my own Deed. And 44. <hi>E.</hi> 3. 4. is, That tenant for years
and he in the Reverſion diſclaim, and it is holden a good Diſclaimer;
which proves, that a poſſibility may alſo paſs by Diſclaimer. And 21. <hi>E.
3.</hi> and 35. <hi>H.</hi> 6. is, That if he who hath cauſe to have a Writ of Error, if
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:40982:18"/>
he enter into the Land, and make a Feoffment, the Writ of Error is
gon for ever; ſo by theſe Caſes it is proved, and appeareth, That a
Poſſibility may paſſe by grant: And ſo in the Principall Caſe, the
Poſſibility to have the terme, is by this Fine granted; and the Grant
is a good Grant, And it was adjourned.</p>

            <p>IN a Writ of Error, the Caſe was this; <hi>Perepoynt</hi> poſſeſſed of a
Leaſe for 99 years, deviſed the ſame unto his Wife for Life; and that
after her Deceaſe, that it ſhould go to his Children unpreferred; the
Wife took Sir <hi>Thomas Fulſter</hi> to her Husband, and the Leaſe was put
in Execution by <hi>Fiery facias</hi> for the Debt of Sir <hi>Thomas Fulſter,</hi> and
afterwards Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> died, and the Wife died: The Adminiſtrators
of Sir <hi>Thomas Fulſter</hi> did reverſe the Judgement, upon which the Leaſe
was taken in Execution: And afterwards <hi>A.</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Pere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynt</hi>
entred, ſuppoſing her ſelfe to be the only Daughter of <hi>Perepoynt</hi>
alive, unpreferred by her Father in his life time. And the Pleading
was, That the Wife of <hi>Perepoynt</hi> was his Executrix, and that ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into the Leaſe after the death of <hi>Perepoynt, Virtute legationis &amp;
donationis praedict. Cook.</hi> There is a difference in our Books, That the
Deviſe of the Occupation of a Term, may be with the Remainder over,
but not a Deviſe of the Term with the Remainder over. And the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſee
of the Occupation of a Term hath one ſpeciall Property, and the
Remainder another Property: As if a Leaſe be extended upon a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,
the Conuſee during the Extent hath one Property, and he who
is to have it afterwards, another Property, and the reaſon of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
is apparent, when the Occupation is deviſed, and when the
terme is deviſed; for in the firſt Caſe, he puts but only a confidence in
the Deviſee, as it appears in <hi>Welkdens</hi> Caſe. But in the other Caſe all
the Property goes, and there is no confidence repoſed in the Deviſee.
And there is a Caſe in the very Point, with which I was of Councell,
and was decreed in the Court of Chancery; it was one <hi>Edolf</hi>'s Caſe;
Where the Deviſe was of a terme, the Remainder to another, and he
made the Deviſee his Executor, and he entred <hi>Virtute donationis;</hi> as in
this Caſe; and it was decreed, That the Executor might alien the
Terme, and that the Remainder could not be good: And to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<hi>Vid. 33. H. 8. 2 E. 6. 37 H.</hi> 6. 30. But if there might be a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder,
yet <hi>Incertae Perſonae nulla donation,</hi> for if all the Children be
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:40982:18"/>
preferred, then the Remainder is void; and then the Property of
the Leaſe is in the Wife; and ſhe might preferre her at any
time during her life, and the generall property cannot be in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but in the Executor, for the Legatee cannot enter, although
that 27 <hi>H.</hi> 6. ſeemeth to be contrary. And if the whole Property be
in the Wife, her Husband might alien it, and therefore it may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
for his Debt, as 7. <hi>H.</hi> 6. 1. is. But it may bee objected, That
the Caſes before put, are of a deviſe of a Term, and this is of a Leaſe.
That makes no difference, for in <hi>Wro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>y</hi>'s Caſe, Leaſe there is ſaid
to contain, not only a terme, but alſo the years to come in the terme.
Then the Queſtion is, If by the ſale of the Sheriff upon the <hi>Fieri facias,</hi> if
the term be ſo gone, that the Wife ſhall not have it by the Reverſall
of the Judgment by Error? for the Judgement is, that the Party ſhall
be reſtored to all that which he hath loſt: It is very cleer that it ſhall
never return, for if it ſhould be ſo, then no ſale made by the Sheriffe
might be good, unleſſe the Judgement be without Error, which would be
a very great damage to the Common Wealth. And alſo by reaſon, and by
the Judgment in the Writ of Error it ſhould not be ſo reſtored, for the
Judgment is, That he ſhall be reſtored to all that which he hath loſt, <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione
judicii;</hi> and here the Defendant hath not loſt any thing by force
of the Judgment, but by force of the Execution: For the Judgment was
to have Execution of 200 li and of the 200 li. he ſhall be reſtored again,
and not of the Leaſe: And therefore in 7. <hi>H.</hi> 7. If a Manor be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
and the Villains of the Manor purchaſe Lands, and afterwards
the Judgment is reverſed by Error, the Recover or ſhall have the Perqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite,
and the other ſhall not be reſtored to it: And 7. <hi>H</hi> 7. A Statute
was delivered in Owell maine, and a recovery was by the Conuſee up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Garniſhment of the Conuſor, and the Conuſee had Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and afterwards the Judgement is reverſed by Error; yet the
Conuſor ſhall not be reſtored to the Land taken in Execution, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Statute ſhall be redelivered back where it was before: And in
this Caſe if the party ſhould be reſtored to the term, it ſhould be great
inconvenience. Alſo if I give one an Authority upon Condition, and the
Party doth execute the Authority, and after the Condition is broken,
the Act is lawfull by him who had Authority upon Condition. And ſo
was the Lord of <hi>Arundels</hi> Caſe, where the Feoffee upon Condition of a
Manor, granted Coppies; it was holden, That the Grants made by him
were good, notwithſtanding the Condition was afterwards broken.
And in 13 <hi>E. 3. Barr</hi> 253. That a Recovery was Erroneous, and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
being in Execution, the Gaoler ſuffered him to eſcape, and after the
Recovery was reverſed for Error, yet the Action lay againſt the Gaoler.
Alſo by him, the Jury have given an imperfect Verdict, ſo as we cannot
tell whether the Party were preferred or not, for the Will was (unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
generally) and the Jury find that ſhe, viz. <hi>A.</hi> the daughter, was not
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:40982:19"/>
preferred by her father in his life time, ſo as the Preferment by the taile
is limited generally; ſo as if any other prefer her, ſhe ſhall not have the
Remainder. And the Jury have found, that ſhe was not preferred by
one certain, <hi>viz.</hi> by her Father; nor in a certain time, in his life
time; which is as much as to ſay, That ſhe was preferred by the Uncle,
Aunt or Mother; and if it were ſo, then the Remainder is not good
to her. Alſo they find no preferment in the life of the father, and it
may be that the Father hath given her preferment by Will, and that
was no preferment in his life, but is conſummate only by his death; and
ſo ſhe might be preferred by him by Implication, by his Will. So as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

Note, that this Caſe was afterwards adjudged at <hi>Hertford</hi>
Terme; and the Judgement was, That the Iſſue of the Wife had
Judgement for her Terme; and that the Judgement upon which the
Execution was, was Erroneous, and reverſed by the Writ of Error;
and that the opinion of the Juſtices was, That the Term was not to be
reſtored, but ſo much for which it was ſold upon the Execution. And

            <p>ONE had certain Minerall Lands Leaſed to him for years, with li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to dig, and make his Profit of the Mine. The Leſſee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
digged for Mine, and ſold the Gravell which came of it: And
by the Opinion of the whole Court, This ſale was no Waſte, for no
Sale is Waſte, if the firſt act be not Waſte: As the Sale of Trees by
Tenant for life or Years is not waſte, if the Cutting and Felling down
of them was not Waſte before, for the Vendition is but a ſecondary
Act, and but ſubſequent to the Act precedent; which Act, if it were
lawfull, the Sale alſo is lawfull, for the Sale alone is not waſte. But
they ſaid, That if the Leſſee fell or cut Timber Trees, and ſell them, it
is waſte <hi>Non quia vendebat, ſed quia ſcindebat;</hi> For if he ſuffer them
to be upon the ground, without doing any thing with them; yet it is
waſte; but he may uſe them for the Reparation of his houſe, and then it
is no waſte: And yet when he fels them with an intent for Reparations,
and afterwards ſells them, it is waſte <hi>Non propter Venditionem</hi> only, but
for the felling; for by this Act done, it is plaine from the beginning to
be unlawfull, for the Sale is only a Declaration of his ill intent, and a
means that his meaning was, by felling of the trees, to benefit himſelf
by the hurt and injury of another. But in the Principall Caſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:40982:19"/>

<hi>Periam</hi> conceived, That ſuch Adminiſtrators made <hi>Durante minori ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate</hi>

may either Sue or be Sued, and may releaſe if there be a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent

caſes which have been put; becauſe there is a great difference betwixt
Contracts and this Action; For in Contracts, the conſideration, and
promiſe, and ſale ought to concur, becauſe a Contract is derived of <hi>con

requiſite ought to concur; as the conſideration of the one ſide, and
the promiſe or ſale of the other ſide. But to maintain an Aſſumpſit,
it is not requiſite, for it is ſufficient if there be any moving cauſe or
conſideration precedent, for which cauſe or conſideration the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:40982:21"/>
was made; and that is the common practice at this day: For in
Aſſumpſit, the Declaration is, That the Defendant, for and in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of ten pounds to him paid <hi>(poſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>a, ſilicet,)</hi> a day or two after,
<hi>ſuper ſe aſſumpſit, &amp;c.</hi> and that is good; and yet there the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is executed. And he ſaid, that <hi>Hunt</hi> and <hi>Baker's</hi> caſe (which ſee
<hi>10. Eliz. Dyer 272.)</hi> would prove it. The caſe was this: The Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice
of <hi>Hunt</hi> was arreſted when <hi>Hunt</hi> was in the Country; and <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi>
one of <hi>Hunts</hi> neighbours, to keep the Apprentice out of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
became his Baile, and paid the debt. Afterwards <hi>Hunt</hi> returning
out of the Country, thanked <hi>Baker</hi> for his neighbourly part, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
him to repay him the ſaid ſumm: Upon which <hi>Baker</hi> brought
an Action upon the Caſe upon the promiſe: And it was adjudged that
the Action would not lie; not becauſe the conſideration was prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to the promiſe, but becauſe it was executed and determined long
before. But there the Juſtices held, That if <hi>Hunt</hi> had requeſted <hi>Baker</hi>
to have been ſurety, or to pay the debt, and upon that requeſt <hi>Baker</hi>
paid the debt, and afterwards <hi>Hunt</hi> promiſeth for that conſideration,
the ſame is good; for the conſideration precedes, and was at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
and requeſt of the Defendant. So here, <hi>Sydenham</hi> became bail
at the requeſt of the Defendant, and therefore it is reaſon, that if he
be at loſſe by his requeſt, that he ought to ſatitfie him. And he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the Law to be cleer, that it was a good conſideration, and that
the requeſt is a great help in the Caſe. <hi>Rodes</hi> Juſtice agreed with <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam,</hi>
for the ſame reaſons, and denyed the Caſe put by <hi>Anderſon.</hi> And
he ſaid, That if one ſerve me for a year, and hath nothing for his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
and afterwards, at the end of the year, I promiſe him ten pounds
for his good and faithfull ſervice ended; he may maintain an Aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pſit,
for it is a good conſideration: But if the ſervant hath wages gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him, and the Maſter, <hi>ex abundantia,</hi> as he ſaid, promiſeth him ten
pounds after his ſervice ended, the ſame promiſe ſhall not maintain
an Aſſumpſit; for there is not any new cauſe or conſideration prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the Aſſumpſit. And <hi>Periam</hi> agreed to that difference, and it was
not denyed by the other Juſtices: but they ſaid that the principall Caſe
was a good caſe to be adviſed upon; and at length, after good advice
and deliberation had of the cauſe, they gave Judgment for the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff,
that the Action would lie. And note, That they very much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyed

the Generall Iſſue; and the Jury gave a ſpeciall Verdict, and found

of <hi>Cork</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi> here, and did not find that <hi>Carter</hi> was poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
of the chain in <hi>London.</hi> And upon this ſpecial Verdict, firſt it was
moved, That the Biſhop of <hi>Cork</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> being in <hi>England,</hi> might
commit adminiſtration of things in <hi>Ireland;</hi> And it was held cleerly by
the Court, That he might of things within his Dioceſſe in <hi>Ireland,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is an Authority, Power, or Matter that followes his Perſon;
and whereſoever his Perſon is, there is his Authority: As the Biſhop
of <hi>London</hi> may commit Adminiſtration, being at <hi>York;</hi> but it ought to
be alwaies of things within his Dioceſſe; and therefore they held,
That the Declaration was good in that point, That the Biſhop of
<hi>Cork</hi> did commit Adminiſtration in <hi>London,</hi> although there be no ſuch
Biſhop of <hi>England.</hi> The ſecond point was, If an Aminiſtrator made
by a Biſhop of <hi>Ireland,</hi> might bring an Action here as Adminiſtrator;
and it was holden, That he could not, becauſe of the Letters of the
Adminiſtration granted in <hi>Ireland,</hi> there could be no triall here in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland;</hi>
although that <hi>Rodes</hi> Juſtice ſaid, That Acts done in Spirituall
Courts in Forrain places, as at <hi>Rome,</hi> or elſewhere, the Law ſaith, That
a Jury may take notice of them; becauſe ſuch Courts, and the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
Courts here, make but one Court; and he proved it by the Caſe
of the <hi>Miſcreancy</hi> in 5. <hi>R. 2. Tryall</hi> 54. where a <hi>Quare Impedit</hi> was
brought by the King againſt the Clerk of a Church, within the Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prick
of <hi>Durham,</hi> and counted that the Biſhop who is dead, preſented
his Clerk, and that the Clerk died, and the Chapter collated a Cardinall,
who for Miſcreancy and Schiſme, was deprived, the Temporalties being
in the Kings hands. <hi>Burgh,</hi> He hath counted of an Avoidance for Miſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancy
at the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> which thing is not tryable here. <hi>Belknap</hi>
Chief Juſtice, I ſay for certain, That this Court ſhall have Conuſans of
the Plea, and that I will prove by Reaſon; for all Spirituall Courts
are but one Court; and if a man in the Arches, be deprived for a
Crime, and appeal to <hi>Rome,</hi> and is alſo there deprived, that Depriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:40982:22"/>
is triable in the Kings Court, in the Arches. And if a
man be adhering unto the Kings enemies in <hi>France,</hi> his Lands are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feitable,
and his adherence ſhall be tryed where his Land is, as often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
it hath been for adherence to the Kings enemies in <hi>Scotland:</hi>
And ſo (by my faith) if one be Miſcreant, his Land is forfeitable, and
the Lord thereof ſhall have the Eſcheat, and that is good reaſon.
For if a man who is out of the Faith of the King, ſhall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
his Land for the ſame; <hi>à for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iori,</hi> he who is out of the faith
of God; and that he ſwore to be Law, Whereupon <hi>Burgh</hi> ſaid,
<hi>Reſpondes ouſter:</hi> And ſo ſaith <hi>Fitzherbert, Tryal</hi> 54. by that Plea and
Judgement, Miſcreancy and Deprivation at <hi>Rome</hi> ſhall bee tryed
here: And there the <hi>Venire facias</hi> was awarded to the Sheriffe
where the Church was, and not to the Biſhop of <hi>Durham;</hi> and
ſo the Miſcreancy and Deprivation ſhall bee tryed where the Church
is. The third Point was, Whether an Adminiſtrator might count
of his own Poſſeſſion, although he was never poſſeſſed: and the
whole Court were of Opinion that he might, if the Inteſtate at
the time of his death was poſſeſſed; The Adminiſtrator may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
of Goods taken out of his owne Poſſeſſion, although he was
never poſſeſſed; for of tranſitory things, the Law caſts upon him
a ſufficient poſſeſſion to maintain an Action Poſſeſſory, as the Lord
before ſeiſin may have a Raviſhment of Ward, &amp;c. But otherwiſe
it is, if one take the Goods of the Inteſtate out of his Poſſeſſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he dieth, for then but only a bare right comes to the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrator.
And that is to bee meant when the Goods are taken
<hi>Tranſgreſſivè,</hi> and not <hi>Deſtrictivè.</hi> The fourth Point was, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Jury might find matter done out of the Realme; and if
that ſhould abate the Writ or not. And they held alſo cleerly,
That upon a generall Iſſue, the Jury may find a Forrain matter,
as a thing done out of the Realme; but it ſhall not abate the
Writ, if it be not matter of ſubſtance, and pleaded before: But
here the finding of the Letters of Adminiſtration, is more then
they had in Iſſue; and alſo is but matter of Evidence; for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
in this Caſe was the Poſſeſſion, and not the Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
for he might have an Action of his Poſſeſſion without ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Letters of Adminiſtration: And afterwards Judgement was
given for <hi>Carter</hi> the Plaintiffe.</p>

Reign, <hi>ex certa ſcientia &amp; mero motu, &amp;c.</hi> did grant to <hi>B. totam
illam portionem decimarum &amp; Garbarum in L. in Com. Norf. unà cum om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus

&amp;c.</hi> And <hi>in facto</hi> the Parſonage of <hi>L.</hi> was parcell of the Abby
of <hi>Wenly,</hi> and out thereof was a portion appertaining to another
Church; And this Rectorie came unto the Queen by the Statute of
diſſolution of <hi>Abbyes:</hi> The queſtion was, whether the Rectorie do
paſs by the Grant, <hi>totam illam portionem:</hi> there being alſo words in the
Patent, <hi>viz. Non obſtante</hi> any <hi>miſnoſmer,</hi> miſrecital, or other ſuch
things which are recited in the Statute for confirmation of Patents.
<hi>Hamon:</hi> the Grant is good; for this word (portion) ſhall not be ſaid
a thing ſevered from the Church and Rectorie; And all the Tythes are
parcel of the Rectorie: for as 44. <hi>E.</hi> 3. 5. is, before the Councel of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teran,</hi>
a man might give his Tythes to what Church he pleaſed; And
when any thing is given to the Church, it is a portion belonging to the
Church; as the Glebe is, which is but a clod of Earth, which is parcel of
the Rectorie and a portion of it. And a caſe in this Court in the time
of this Queen, was argued, and there in a Rectorie there were many
Prieſts, and each of them knew his portion, ſo as they were called portio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Prieſts, which was in reſpect they had each of them intereſt in the
Church, and not becauſe their portions were ſevered each from the
other. And 22. <hi>E.</hi> 4. 24. by <hi>Pigot</hi> it is ſaid, If a Parſon hath any Tythes
in another Pariſh, as appertaining to his Church, it is called a porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
ſo as portion is not meant that which is ſevered by it ſelf as in groſs;
But by portion is meant all the Tythes appertaining to the Rectorie, or
the Rectorie it ſelf. For as 22. <hi>Aſſ.</hi> 9. is, If the King have Tythes of
thoſe Lands which lie out of any Pariſh, if he grant <hi>totam portionem de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimarum,
&amp;c.</hi> I conceive, that the Tythes ſhall paſs thereby: And yet it
is a thing ſevered from other Tythes; but it doth contain all the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
of Tythes in that place. And alſo if the King grant his Rectorie
of <hi>D.</hi> to <hi>J. S.</hi> ſaving to him the Tythes, and afterwards grants <hi>totam
portionem Decimarum, &amp;c.</hi> I conceive cleerly (under correction) that the
Tythes ſhall paſs. And in the principal caſe, If the Tythes ſhall not
paſs by this word (portion;) yet the <hi>Non obſtante</hi> in the Letters Patents
<hi>de male nominando, &amp;c.</hi> ſhall make it to be a good grant, and that ſo the
Tythes ſhall paſs thereby. We are alſo to conſider, if by any words
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:40982:23"/>
ſubſequent in the Patent, the grant be not good. <hi>viz.</hi> by theſe words, <hi>cum
omnibus aliis Decimis &amp;c. in tenura &amp; occupatione</hi> Johannis Corbet &amp;c.
Whereas in truth <hi>John Corbet</hi> was never Occupier of them: And as to
that, I conceive, That the words before, <hi>cum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>omnibus, &amp;c.</hi> paſſe the Tithes;
And that the words after, ſhall not abridge or controle the largeneſs
of the precedent words; and to that purpoſe is the Caſe 39. <hi>E.</hi> 3. 9. of
the Grant of the King to the Earle of <hi>Saliſbury,</hi> &amp;c. In the end of
which Grant were theſe words, <hi>Quas nuper conceſſimus patri, &amp;c.</hi> although
that the thing granted, was never granted to the Father; yet the Grant
was good, and not reſtreined by thoſe words coming after. 2. <hi>E.</hi> 4.
A Releaſe was pleaded of a right which the party had in Lands of the
part of his Father, &amp;c. there, although he had the Land from the part
of his Mother, yet the Releaſe was good. In the Caſe of the Biſhop
of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> which was lately argued in the Exchequer Chamber;
There it was agreed, That if the King grant a Faire in ſuch a place, or
elſewhere in the County of Somerſet; if he miſtake the County, in
putting one County for another, yet the Grant is good, and all that
coming after the <hi>alibi</hi> ſhall be void. He further argued, That all the
matter appearing by ſpeciall Verdict, is not well found; for the Jury
find, That no Tithes were in the Occupation of <hi>John Corbet</hi> at the time
of the Grant; and no mention is in it, that they were not in his Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation
nor in the Occupation of his Aſſignes; for they might be in the
Occupation of his Aſſigns, although that they were not in his own Occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation:
For in a Verdict, if it ſtrongly imply any thing not expreſſed (as
in the Caſe of <hi>Trivilian:</hi> where the Jury found a deviſe of Land, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſaying, That the Land was holden in Socage) it is a good finding of
the Jury; for no deviſe could be, if it were not of Land holden in Socage,
and therefore that tenure is implyed. Contrary, When a man is to plead
a Deviſe; but where the Verdict doth not ſtrongly imply a thing, it ſhall
not be good; as in <hi>Scolaſticas</hi> Caſe, <hi>Plo. Com.</hi> 411. Exception was taken
that the Jury did not find, That the Deviſor had not any Heir Male alive
<hi>praeter</hi> the ſaid <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Francis;</hi> for if he had, the wife of the Plaintiffe
had no cauſe of Action. And it was there holden by <hi>Harper,</hi> That it
was not a good Verdict for the incertainty; ſo in our Caſe. <hi>Cook</hi>
contrary: 1. The Grant is not good, and the Rectory is no part of
it; nor can they paſſe by the word [Portion.] 1. By the Etimology
of the word; for Portion is a thing in groſſe by it ſelfe, and cannot
paſſe by that thing which is intended <hi>Nomen Collectivum,</hi> as a Rectory is.
So of a Manor; if a man grant <hi>totam illam portionem Manerii,</hi> hee
being ſeiſed of a Manor, nothing paſſeth; for <hi>portio</hi> is no more then
<hi>partio,</hi> as the Latiniſts ſay; and then if a man grant all that part of his
Manor, or part of his Tithes in <hi>D.</hi> and he be ſeiſed of the whole Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
of <hi>D.</hi> or of the Rectory of <hi>D.</hi> nothing paſſeth. Alſo the words
after expound the Queens mind, for the words precedent are coupled
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:40982:23"/>
with a <hi>Cum)</hi> after, <hi>ſcil. Cum omnibus aliis,</hi> &amp;c. So as the firſt part
ſhews the grant of Tithes, and the later part ſhews what Tithes; viz.
thoſe which were in the Occupation of <hi>John Corbet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> ſo as but part is
granted: and in the Kings Grant, a part ſhall not be taken for the
whole; and ſo in no caſe, if not by the Figure Synecdoche, which
cannot be in caſes of Grants at the common Law. Alſo the words are,
<hi>totam illam portionem,</hi> &amp;c. and not <hi>totam meam portionem,</hi> &amp;c. and the
word <hi>[illa]</hi> or <hi>[that,]</hi> ought to have a word <hi>[What;]</hi> which is a word
ſhewing in whoſe poſſeſſion the portion was. Alſo the Kings Letters
Patents ought for the moſt part be taken according to the meaning of
the King; for the caſe was in the Exchequer: That where the King
granted all his Tenements in <hi>D.</hi> that nothing paſſed by that Grant, but
the Houſes. Otherwiſe it is in the caſe of a common perſon. So 22. <hi>Aſſ.</hi>
where the King grants goods of Felons <hi>quorumcun<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> damnatorum,</hi> it
ſhall not extend to Treaſon, nor to murder of the Kings Meſſenger.
So 8. <hi>H.</hi> 4. 2. If the Grant be of all the goods of thoſe who <hi>pro ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua
tranſgreſſione ſive delicto, &amp;c. forisfacere deberent;</hi> it ſhall not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to thoſe who are <hi>felo de ſe.</hi> Alſo the <hi>Non obſtante</hi> doth not help
the matter; For I take this difference, When nothing paſſeth by the
words precedent, <hi>Ex vi termini,</hi> there nothing is helped by the <hi>Non ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtante:</hi>
But if any thing paſſe by the precedent words, <hi>Ex vi ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini,</hi>
there a <hi>Non obſtante</hi> may make the thing good, which otherwiſe
ſhould be void: As if the King grant to <hi>J. S.</hi> the Manor of <hi>D. Non
obſtante</hi> that he is ſeiſed for the term of life thereof; it is a void Grant:
But if the Grant were of the Manor of <hi>D.</hi> notwithſtanding that <hi>I. S.</hi>
hath it for life, here the <hi>Non obſtante</hi> makes the Grant good; which
otherwiſe ſhould be the ignorance of the King to make a Grant of that
of which he is excluded by the <hi>Non obſtante;</hi> becauſe thereby he takes
knowledg of the particular eſtate, and ſo he is not deceived. As to the
matter moved againſt the Verdict, I conceive, that it makes againſt the
other ſide; for it was on his part to prove the Occupation: and if
there be no Occupation at the time of the Leaſe, the Grant is void:
and he was to prove it, being in the affirmative. And then, <hi>in re dubia
majus inficiatio quàm affirmatio intelligenda:</hi> and [a May be] may be
intended in every caſe. And if ſuch conſtruction ſhould be in ſpeciall
Verdicts, I dare affirm, that by ſuch [May bees] all ſpeciall Verdicts
ſhall be quaſhed: But the Law is, to give a favourable conſtruction of
them, according to the meaning of the Jurours. <hi>Snagg</hi> contrary: and
by him theſe words, <hi>[cum omnibus aliis, &amp;c.]</hi> are void in the Kings
caſe: and vouched the caſe of 29. <hi>E.</hi> 3. 9. before vouched; Where the
King had granted to the Earl of Salisbury the cuſtody of the Lands of
the Prior of <hi>Mountague,</hi> being ſeiſed into the Kings hands as a Prior
Alien: and afterwards the Earl died, his Heir within age, whereby the
ſaid Lands, and others, and Advowſons, came to the Kings hand by
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:40982:24"/>
reaſon of minority; and afterwards the King granted to the Son all
the Lands and Advowſons which were <hi>Patris ſui, ac omnes terras, ac
omnes advocationes</hi> of the ſaid Prior, which the King had before given
to the father of the ſaid ſon. And it was there holden, That although
that the Advowſons paſſed not to the Father, yet by that grant they
did paſſe; and that theſe woads [which he granted to his father] were
meerly void. <hi>Cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nche</hi> Juſtice. Nothing paſſeth by this word [Portion]
for it is a thing in groſs, and a thing in groſs cannot contain another
thing, and a word which ſignifies a thing in groſſe cannot paſſe another
thing: As if a man grant all his Services in <hi>D.</hi> it is to be intended Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
in groſſe; and if he have not any Services, but thoſe which are
parcell of a Manor, nothing ſhall paſſe by thoſe words. But I conceive,
That thoſe Tithes which are parcell of the Rectory ſhall paſſe by theſe
words, <hi>Cum aliis, &amp;c.</hi> For although that the words are, in the tenure of
<hi>John Corbet,</hi> yet if they were not in his tenure, the <hi>Non obſtante</hi> will
help it; for it is, <hi>Non obſtante</hi> any miſnaming of the Tenants, or of
the quantity or quality of the Tithes; ſo as theſe words imply as much
as if the Grant had been in the tenure of <hi>John Corbet,</hi> or of any other
in <hi>L.</hi> or elſewhere. <hi>Gaudy</hi> Juſtice, If the words <hi>Totam illam portionem</hi>
were left out of the Book, the other words, <hi>Cum omnibus aliis,</hi> ſhall
paſſe nothing; and thoſe words <hi>Totam illam portionem,</hi> are as nothing
to paſſe a thing not in groſſe; and by conſequence nothing ſhall paſſe
by the other words: And afterwards Judgement was given, That no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
paſſed by the Letters Patents.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>CRopp</hi> made a Leaſe for years, reſerving rent at <hi>Mich.</hi> upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
That if the rent be behind at <hi>Mich.</hi> and a Month after,
that he might enter. The Leſſee after <hi>Mich.</hi> and before the Month
ended, ſent his ſervant to the houſe of <hi>Cropp,</hi> to pay the money to
<hi>Cropp;</hi> the ſervant coming to <hi>Cropps</hi> houſe; found him not, for he
was not at the Houſe; the Servant delivered the Rent to one <hi>Marge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Briggs,</hi> who was his Daughter in Law, to deliver the ſame to <hi>Cropp</hi>
the Leſſor. And the ſame <hi>Margery</hi> at one or two dayes before the
payment of the ſaid Rent, had received the Rent in the like manner,
and had paid it to <hi>Cropp,</hi> and he had accepted of it: But now he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to receive it of her, but at the laſt day of the Month he went to
the Land, and there demanded the Rent, and becauſe it was not paid,
he entred. <hi>Laiton</hi> argued for the Leſſor. That his entry was lawfull,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:40982:24"/>
for, he ſaid, That the Tender made by <hi>Margery Briggs</hi> to the Leſſor
was not ſufficient: 1. Becauſe the Servant of the Leſſee had Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to deliver it to the Leſſor; therefore when he delivers it to another,
he hath not purſued his Authority. 19. <hi>H.</hi> 8. &amp; 27. <hi>H.</hi> 8. Letter of
Atturney made to diverſe to give livery of Seiſin. If one make
Livery alone, it is void; 34. <hi>H.</hi> 6. If a <hi>Capias</hi> be to many Coroners,
and one execute it, it is void; 18. <hi>E.</hi> 4. If one hath a Letter of Atturney
to make Livery, he cannot transfer this Authority to another to make
Livery for him. Alſo, if in this Caſe a Stranger had tendered the Rent,
the Leſſor was not bound to receive it; as upon a Mortgage, if a
Stranger tender the Money, the Mortgagee is not bound to accept of
it. 21. <hi>E.</hi> 4. In caſe of Corporall Service, as Homage or Fealty, the
demand is to be made of the perſon; but of Rent, the demand is to be
made upon the Land, becauſe the Land is the Debtor. <hi>Clenche</hi>
Juſtice conceived, That if the Leſſee himſelfe had delivered the Rent
to <hi>Margery Briggs,</hi> that it had been good, but it is a doubt if good,
made by the ſervant, for he could not transfer his Authority to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<hi>Wray</hi> Chief Juſtice, If it were upon a Bond, the Obligee was
not bound to accept of it before the day; ſo if it were payable at <hi>Mich.</hi>
only, there the Leſſor is not bound to accept of it before the day: but
in as much as 'tis after the day, the Month is a Liberty and Benefit for
the Leſſee; and it was due at <hi>Mich.</hi> therefore I conceive, That being
tendred to him within any part of the Month, that he is bound to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of it. And as to that, That his ſervant cannot transfer his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
over, and therefore <hi>Margery Briggs</hi> is but a ſtranger in that act:
that is not ſo, for now ſhe is a ſervant in that, to the Leſſor himſelf;
and therefore there is privity enough: alſo ſhe hath received the Rent
for him before. What then, ſaid <hi>Laiton?</hi> We can prove a ſpeciall
commandment for the time before that ſhe received it. At another
day the Caſe was moved again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and it was ruled againſt <hi>Cropp</hi> the
Leſſor, becauſe the rent was due at <hi>Mich.</hi> and the month after was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
becauſe of the penalty of Re-entry; and the Tender and Refuſall
after the Rent was due, and within the month, ſaves the penalty; and
alſo Lawes ought to be expounded <hi>Secundùm <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>quum &amp; bonum,</hi> and
good conſcience; and the Leſſor was at no prejudice, if he had accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of it, when his Daughter in Law tendred it unto him; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was conceived, That he had an intent to defraud the Leſſee of
his Leaſe; and the Law doth not favour Frauds; and therefore it was
adjudged againſt <hi>Cropp</hi> the Leſſor.</p>

            <p>IN a <hi>Quare Impedit</hi> by the Queen againſt <hi>Savacre</hi> Clerk, the Caſe was
this; The Queen preſented to a Parſonage which was void, by the
taking of another Benefice by the ſaid <hi>Savacre;</hi> and the ſaid <hi>Savacre</hi> for
to enable him to have two Benefices, pleaded, That he was the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain
of Sir <hi>James a Croſts,</hi> Controller of the Queens Houſe, who, by
the Statute of 21. <hi>H. 8. cap.</hi> 13. might have two Chaplains, and might
qualifie them to take two Benefices; to which it was replied, That the
ſaid Sir <hi>James a Croſt</hi> had two other Chaplains, which are qualified to
have two Benefices, and have alſo two Benefices by reaſon of that qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification,
and alſo are alive; ſo as he is a third Chaplain, who could
not be qualified by that Statute. To which it was anſwered; That
one of thoſe two Chaplains is removed and diſcharged by the ſaid Sir
<hi>James a Croſt</hi> to be his Domeſticall Chaplain: <hi>ſcil. Capellanum fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarem,</hi>
as it was pleaded, and ſo he hath now but two Chaplains, of
which the Defendant was one; upon which there was demurrer joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Three Points were in the Caſe: 1. If the qualification, <hi>Sub ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gillo,</hi>
be ſufficient within the Statute, without the Signature or name
of Sir <hi>James a Croſt.</hi> 2. When two Chaplains are qualified, and one
is removed out of ſervice, if he might qualifie another by the Statute,
the party being alive who was qualified. 3. Whether he remain his
Chaplain, notwithſtanding ſuch removall during his life. Upon which
Points, after peruſall of the Statute, it was agreed by the whole Court,
That the Queen ought to have Judgement, and ſo they gave Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
preſently: And the reaſons of their Judgement were, for the firſt
Point, Becauſe that the Defendant <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cre</hi> was not qualified, <hi>Sub
Signo &amp; Sigillo praedict. Jacobi a Croſt,</hi> but only <hi>Sub Sigillo;</hi> and the
words of the Statute are, viz. Under the Sign and Seal of the King or
other their Lord or Maſter, &amp;c. Which words, Or other their Lord
or Maſter, ſhall be referred to Sign and Seal, which is limited to the
King. And as to the ſecond Point, they held the Law to be cleer,
That after that he hath retained as many as by the Law he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
and they are <hi>ſub Signo</hi> and <hi>Sigillo</hi> teſtified to bee his Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains,
and by reaſon thereof have qualification to have two Benefices,
and have two Benefices by vertue thereof, although that afterwards
they are removed for diſpleaſure or otherwiſe out of ſervice; yet du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
their lives, their Maſter cannot take other Chaplains, which may
by this Statute be qualified; for ſo every Baron might have infinite
of Chaplains which might be qualified, which was not the meaning of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:40982:26"/>
the Statute; and of that opinion is the Lord <hi>Dyer</hi> in his Reports.
And as to the third Point, they held, That although he were remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from the Domeſticall Service of the Family, yet hee did remaine
Chaplain at large; and ſo a Chaplain within the Statute: And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the Opinion of the Court was in this Caſe, That if the party qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified
to die, the Queen, or other Maſter mentioned in the Statute,
might qualifie another againe: <hi>Quod nota.</hi> The Caſe was entred

            <p>IN an Indictment upon the Statute of 8. <hi>H.</hi> 6. of Forcible Entry, the

might be to one although not in poſſeſſion, as to a Reverſioner
upon a term for yeers, or upon a Wardſhip; but he could not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed

And after it ſaith, that the Tenant was expulſed; and two cannot be

Termor expelled; and it applyes the word <hi>expulit</hi> to both. And <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi>
took another Exception, that the Cart is ſet before the horſe: For

            <p>THis Caſe was moved in Court. A Copy-holder committed Waſte,

for it is not as the Caſe 45 <hi>E.</hi> 3. where a Leaſe is made upon Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that the Leſſee ſhall not do Waſte, and he commits Waſte, and
then the Leſſor accepts the Rent, there he cannot enter; But otherwiſe
is it of a Copy-hold, for there is a condition in Law, and here in Fait; and
a condition in Fait may ſave the Land by an Acceptance, but a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in Law cannot; for by the condition in Law broken, the Eſtate of the
Copyholder is meerly void. And the Court agreed, That when ſuch
a Forfeiture is preſented, it is not to Entitle the Lord, but to give
him notice; for the Copy-hold is in him by the Forfeiture preſently
without any Preſentment. A man made a Leaſe for years, upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
that he ſhould not aſſign over his Leaſe, and it was reſerving
Rent; and after he did aſſign it, and then the Leſſor accepted the
rent, there he ſhall not enter for the condition broken. Leſſee for
years, upon condition, that he ſhould not do Waſte, and the Leſſor
accepts of the Rent for the quarter in which the Waſte was done, yet
he may enter; but if he do accept of a ſecond payment of the Rent, then
it is otherwiſe; but if it were upon condition, That if he do waſte,
that his Eſtate ſhall ceaſe: There no acceptance of the Rent by the

            <head>63 The Vicar of Pancras Caſe.</head>
            <p>THE Vicar of <hi>Pancras</hi> ſued one in the Spirituall Court for Tithes;
And he pleaded, That ſome of them, for which the Vicar did
ſue, did belong to the Parſon; and that he had paid them to the Parſon,
and prayed a Prohibition. <hi>Cook,</hi> He ſhall not have a Prohibition; for
by this Plea he hath put in Debate the controverſie of the Tithes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Parſon and Vicar; and then when both are Spiritual Perſons,
the common Law ſhall not hold Plea of them, as is 35. <hi>H.</hi> 6. 39. and
<hi>31. H</hi> 6. Alſo by this Plea a <hi>Modus decimandi</hi> is not in queſtion, but
the right of the Tithes, and that doth appertain to the common Law.
And there <hi>Cook</hi> ſaid, That is holden in 11. <hi>H.</hi> 7. That Unions and
Endowments of Vicarages do appertain to the Spirituall Law. Alſo
the preſcription of the Defendant was, That he had uſed, time out of
mind, &amp;c. to have for horſes a gi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that they had uſed to pay for every Cow to the Vicar 4. <hi rend="sup">d</hi>. and for
the Calfe and Milk of every Cow, 6. <hi rend="sup">d</hi>. And <hi>Cook</hi> took exception
that ſuch preſcription was double and repugnant in it ſelf, for he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes
that he paies for herbage; and then he preſcribes, That he paies
for every Cow 4 <hi rend="sup">d</hi>. which cannot be meant but for herbage of the Cow,
for it is not for Milk or Calfe of the Cow, for he preſcribes to pay for
them 6. <hi rend="sup">d</hi>. He took another Exception, That he preſcribes that he
hath uſed to pay, but doth not ſhew that he hath paid; for ſo he ought
to do, for otherwiſe he ſhall out the Spirituall Court of Juriſdiction,
and yet not give any remedy in this Court. Alſo, he ſaith, That he
hath paid, but doth not ſhew where; and the other may ſay, <hi>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

makes preſcription of a <hi>Modus decimandi,</hi> for the diſcharge of Tithes
in kind. As to that which <hi>Cook</hi> ſaid, That he preſcribes that he hath
uſed to pay to the Parſon, and doth not ſay, That it was due to the
Parſon; and if he pay the Vicars Tithes to the Parſon, he doth wrong
to the Vicar; He ſaith, That he hath paid, and uſed to pay 4 <hi rend="sup">d</hi>. to the

ſaid, That the preſcription is ſet forth according to the truth of the

anſwered, That he conceived the iſſue will bee upon the Cuſtome or
<hi>Modus decimandi.</hi> And <hi>Gawdy</hi> Juſtice agreed to that. <hi>Suit</hi> Juſtice,
There is no <hi>Modus decimandi</hi> alledged; for when he ſaith, That he hath

            <p>THe Caſe was this. A man gave lands to <hi>J. S. Habendum</hi> to him,
and to three other for their lives, <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t eorum diutius viventi ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſivè:</hi>
The queſtion was, What eſtate <hi>J. S.</hi> had: and if after his life
there were any occupancy in the Caſe? <hi>Cooke,</hi> That <hi>J. S.</hi> had an
eſtate but for his life onely, becauſe he cannot have an eſtate for
his life, and for the life of another, where the intereſt commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
both in <hi>praeſenti:</hi> but he may have an eſtate for his own life in
preſent intereſt, and the remainder thereof for anothers life: But this
<hi>Habendum</hi> by no means can create a Remainder. And he ſaid, that as
a Leaſe to one for life, <hi>Habendum</hi> to him <hi>&amp; primog<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nito filio ſuo,</hi> was
no Remainder <hi>primogenito filio</hi> (although ſome held to the contrary.)
So a Leaſe for years, <hi>Habendum</hi> to him and to another, was no Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to the other. Alſo the word <hi>ſucceſſivè</hi> doth not make a Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
as 30. <hi>H. 8. Br. Joyn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ts</hi> 53. where a Leaſe for life to three, or for
yeers to three, <hi>Habendum ſucceſſivè;</hi> yet they have a joynt eſtate: and
<hi>ſucceſſivè</hi> is void: for he ſaid, It is uncertain who ſhall have it firſt,
and who ſecondly. Alſo one cannot have an eſtate for his own life,
and for the life of another at the ſame time in preſent intereſt; for
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:40982:31"/>
the greater will drown the leſſer: But if the greater be <hi>in praeſenti,</hi> and
the leſſe <hi>in futuro,</hi> as a leaſe for his own life, the Remainder to him for
another mans life, it is otherwiſe. As a leaſe for his own life, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
for yeers, is good. But if I make a leaſe to you for your own
life, and 100 years, both to begin at the ſame time, the Leaſe for yeers
is drowned: and an eſtate for his own life is greater then an eſtate for
anothers life, and ſhall drown the eſtate for anothers life. <hi>Vide</hi> 19. E. 3.
<hi>Surr.</hi> 8. where Tenant for life of a Manor did ſurrender to Tenant for
life in Reverſion. And 12. <hi>H.</hi> 7. 11. and <hi>Perkins</hi> 113. That if there be
a Leaſe for life to one, the Remainder to another for life, and the Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee
for life doth ſurrender to him in the Remainder, it is good. So <hi>Dyers</hi>
Reports. A leaſe is made to one for the term of another mans life, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
impeachment of Waſte, the Remainder to him for his own life; he
is now puniſhable for waſte, for the firſt eſtate is ſurrendred. <hi>Gaudy</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
If a leaſe be made to one for his life, and ſo long as another man
ſhall live, <hi>quaere</hi> what eſtate he hath. 2. If there can be any Occupancy
in the Caſe: for if the eſtate be void, the limitation upon the eſtate is
void: therefore if the eſtate for the other mans life be drowned in the
eſtate for his own life, that can be no Occupancy. Alſo the Occupancy is
pleaded, That ſuch a one entred, and doth not ſay, claiming as occupant.
For if one come hawking upon the land, he ſhall not by ſuch entry be an
Occupant; and in the book of Entries it is pleaded that he entred clay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
as Occupant. <hi>Clenche</hi> Juſtice, Every Occupancy ought to be in
poſſeſſion; for otherwiſe the Law caſts the intereſt of it upon him in the
Reverſion. But <hi>Gaudy</hi> and <hi>Suit</hi> Juſtices were utterly againſt him in that;
for then they ſaid, there ſhould be no occupancy, if the party were not
in by Leaſe, or ſuch like means.</p>

            <p>IN an Action of Treſpaſſe brought, the defendant did juſtifie as Leſſee
to the Lord <hi>Mountagu,</hi> and ſaid, that the Lord <hi>Mountagu</hi> for him and
his Farmors, had uſed to have a way over the land in which the treſpaſs is
ſuppoſed to be done: And that by rooting of a cart wheel the way was ſo
digged and drowned, that he could not ſo wel uſe his way as before, and
that therefore he did fill up the cart roots, and digged a trench to let
out the water: upon which the plaintiffe did demur in law: For 15. <hi>H.</hi> 7.
is, that a Commoner cannot meddle with the ſoil: ſo is 12. &amp; 13. <hi>H.</hi> 8. So
he who hath Warren in the land of another man cannot meddle with
the ſoile: and as to that, that he could not uſe his way ſo well as before,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:40982:31"/>
it is not good: for he ought to have ſaid, That he could not uſe his
way at all: otherwiſe the plea is not good. As 6. <hi>E.</hi> 4. One is to lop his
tree, and he cannot do it unleſs it fall upon the Land of another, there he
may well juſtifie the felling of it upon the others Land, becauſe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
he could not lop it at all. So if I give to one all the fiſh in my
Pond, he cannot dig a Trench to draw out the water, unleſſe he cannot
otherwiſe take the fiſh, as with Nets, &amp;c. Alſo he juſtifies, by reaſon that
the Lord <hi>Mountagu</hi> for him and his Farmors, &amp;c. And he was a Leſſee
and paid no rent, therefore no Farmor. <hi>Cowper</hi> contrary, He ſhall
not have an Action of Treſpaſs, for it is no loſſe or hinderance unto
him, but it is for his profit, for the Land is the worſe being drowned
with water. If a man do diſſeiſe me, and fells trees upon the Land, and
doth repair the houſes; in an Aſſize brought againſt him, the ſame ſhall be
recowped in damages; becauſe that which was done was for his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity:
alſo it is incident to one who hath a way for to mend it. All
Preſcriptions at the firſt did begin by Grants. And if one grant to me
his trees, the Law ſaith, That I may come upon the Land to fell them and
carry them away off from the Land, and I ſhall not be a Treſpaſſor:
And by 9. <hi>E.</hi> 4. and <hi>Perkins,</hi> If one grant to me liberty to lay a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duit
Pipe in his Land, I may afterwards mend it <hi>toties quoties</hi> it ſhall want
mending 32. <hi>E.</hi> 3. If one grant to me a way, if he will interrupt me in it,
I may reſiſt him; and if he dig Trenches in the way to my hinderance
in my way, I may fill them up again: The books of 12 &amp; 13. <hi>H.</hi> 8. are
not adjudged. If Leſſee for years be of a Meadow, he may dig to avoid
the water, and may juſtifie ſo doing in Waſte brought againſt him. But
it was ſaid, That in that Caſe the Leſſee hath an intereſt in the ſoil; ſo
hath not he who claims the way in this Caſe. <hi>Clenche</hi> Juſtice held, That
he could not dig the Soile. Then the Defendant demanded, What re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
he ſhould have. <hi>Suit</hi> Juſtice, If he went that way before in his
ſhooes, let him now pluck on his boots. <hi>Gawdy,</hi> The pleading is not

is not good; but he ought to plead, that he could not uſe the way at all.</p>

and Judgement was given for the Plaintiffe againſt the Defendant
<hi>Joyce,</hi> and a Writ of Error was brought to reverſe the Judgement,
and divers Errors were aſſigned. The firſt Error which was aſſigned
was, That the Plaintiffe doth preſcribe, That all the Inhabitants of the
Bell &amp;c. had uſed to ſcowre the Gutter, &amp;c. And it was ſaid,
That that was no good forme of preſcription, as in 12. <hi>H. 4. 7. Br.

been <hi>quod ipſi &amp; praedeceſſores ſui de tempere cujus contrarium, &amp;c.</hi> Or
that ſuch a one and his Anceſtors or Predeceſſors, whoſe Eſtate the
Defendant hath, &amp;c. Alſo if a Copy-holder preſcribe, That he and
all his Tenants <hi>tenementi praedict'</hi> have uſed to have eſtovers in ſuch a
Wood, &amp;c. it is not good: but he ought to preſcribe in the Manor.
The ſecond Error was, That the Preſcription was uncertain, for it is,
That all Tenants, &amp;c. which extendeth to Tenants in Fee, in Taile,
for Life, or years; and the Preſcription is the foundation and ground
of the Action, and therefore it ought to be certain: As if one make
Title for entry for Mortmaine, he ought to ſhew that he hath entred

cannot preſcribe, for his Eſtate hath a certain beginning, and a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
end, therefore it is not of long continuance. The third Error was,
That the Plaintiffe hath not alledged, That the Defendant was Tenant

the Action brought, and not at the time of the diverſion of the Water:
But Judgement was given, and Error brought upon it. The fourth
Error was, Becauſe it was for ſcowring a Gutter betwixt the houſes,
&amp;c. and doth not ſay, That the houſe was <hi>contigue adjacens</hi> to his houſe.
<hi>22. H.</hi> 6. Where Cattell eſcape into the Plaintiffs Cloſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon

meet with the Plaintiffe. So if one charge one with <hi>debet &amp; detinet,</hi> and
he anſwer to the <hi>debet</hi> only, it is no iſſue, and therefore it is not helped.
In 29. <hi>H.</hi> 6. in Treſpaſſe for entring into his houſe and taking of his
Goods, the Defendant pleaded <hi>non intravit,</hi> and the iſſue was tried,
and Damages given; and becauſe the taking of the Goods was not

Plaintiffe chargeth the Defendant in Account as Bailiffe of his houſe,
and that he had Adminiſtration of his Goods, viz. forty Sacks of wool:
And the Jury found that he was not Bailiffe or his houſe, but they
found that he had received the Sacks of Wooll to render account &amp;c.
and he had judgement for the Goods, although it was not found for
the houſe. <hi>Vide 5. H. 7. 24. a.</hi> Where if a Jury be charged with ſeveral

or miſcontinuance. <hi>Daniel ad idem.</hi> And he ſaid, That the books
before of 14. <hi>H.</hi> 4. and 49. <hi>E.</hi> 3. were not ruled; in the one book, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant
pleaded, That the Plaintiff gave the goods to him; in the other,
that he ſold them to him, and demanded Judgement of the Action;
and it is no good anſwer, for they are Pleas only before the Auditors,
and not in an Action of Account; and although the Verdict be found
for part only, yet it is good, for no Damages are to be recovered
in an Account. In Treſpaſſe it is true, if one be found and not the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and joint Damages be given, the Verdict is naught for all; but
if ſeverall Damages be given, it is good, as it is ruled in 21. <hi>H. 6.
Cook 26. H.</hi> 8. is, That he cannot declare generally of an houſe, <hi>curam
habens &amp; adminiſtrationem bonorum;</hi> but he ought further to ſay, viz.
Twenty Quarters of Corn, and the like, &amp;c. In the Principal Caſe it is a
joint charge, and one charge for the Shop and Goods, and he anſwers
unto one only; but he ought to anſwer to all; or elſe it is no anſwer
at all: See 10. <hi>E.</hi> 4. 8. But <hi>Cook</hi> found another thing, <hi>ſcil.</hi> That there
is thing put in iſſue which is not in the Verdict, nor found, nor
touched in the Verdict; and that makes all that which is found,
not good, and that is not helped by any Statute. I grant that diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuances

for the traverſe of the Shop <hi>prout</hi> anſwers to all: but now he charges

            <head>70 GILE'S Caſe.</head>
            <p>A Writ of Error was brought to reverſe a Judgement given in an
Action upon the Caſe. The Action upon the Caſe was brought
againſt one, <hi>Quare exaltavit ſtagnum, per quod ſuum pratum fuit inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datum;</hi>
and he pleaded Not guilty; and the Jury found <hi>Quod erexit
ſtagnum;</hi> and if <hi>Errectio</hi> be <hi>Exaltatio,</hi> then the Jury find, that the
Defendant is guilty; and thereupon Judgement was given for the
Plaintiffe. <hi>Glanvile</hi> alledged the generall Error, That Judgement was
given for the Plaintiffe, where it ought to have been given for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant.
And he ſaid, That <hi>erigere ſtagnum, eſt de novo facere: Exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare,
eſt erectum majoris altitudinis facere; Deexaltare</hi> is <hi>ad priſtinam al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudinem
adducere: proſternere ſtagnum, eſt penitus tollere.</hi> And the
preciſe and apt word according to his Caſe, in an Action upon the Caſe,
ought to be obſerved; that he may have Judgement according to his
damage and his complaint, viz. either <hi>Deexaltare</hi> or <hi>Poſternere, &amp;c. 7. E.
3.</hi> 56. An Aſſize of Nuſans, <hi>Quare exaltavit ſtagnum ad nocumentum liberi
tenementi ſui;</hi> The Defendant pleaded, That he had not inhaunced it
after it was firſt levyed. And by <hi>Trew,</hi> There is not any other Writ
in the Chancery, but <hi>Quare exaltavit ſtagnum. Herle</hi> ſaid, That he
might have a Writ <hi>Quare levavit ſtagnum;</hi> and there by that book <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vare
ſtagnum, &amp; exaltare ſtagnum</hi> do differ: And therefore he concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
That the Writ ſhould abate, for uſing one word for another,
<hi>8. E. 3. 21. Nuſans</hi> 5. by <hi>Chauntrell.</hi> In a Writ of Nuſans <hi>Quare leva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit,</hi>
if it be found that it was tortiouſly levied, the whole ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed:
But in a Writ <hi>Quare exaltavit,</hi> nothing ſhall be pulled down
if it be found for the Plaintiffe, but the inhauncing ſhall be abated on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
So 8. <hi>Aſſ. 9. Br. Nuſans</hi> 17. the ſame Caſe and difference is put,
and 16. <hi>E. 3. Fitz. Nuſans</hi> 11. If the Nuſans be found in any other
forme then the Plaintiffe hath ſuppoſed, he ſhall not recover. And in
<hi>48. E. 3. 27. Br. Nuſans</hi> 9. The Writ was <hi>Quare divertit curſum aquae:
&amp;c.</hi> and ſhewed that he had put Piles and ſuch things in the water, by
which the courſe of the water was ſtreitned; wherefore, becauſe he
might have had a Writ <hi>Quare coarctavit curſum qquae,</hi> the Writ was hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:40982:34"/>
not to be good. <hi>Cook</hi> took another Exception, viz. That the
Aſſize of Nuſans ought to be againſt the Tenant of the Free-hold, and
therefore it cannot be (as it was here) brought againſt the Workmen,
and it is not ſhewed here, that the Defendant was Tenant of the Soil;
for 33. <hi>H.</hi> 6. 26. by <hi>Moile,</hi> If a way be ſtreitned and impaired, an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
upon the Caſe; lieth; but if it be altogether ſtop'd, an Aſſize of
Nuſans lieth. But <hi>Priſoit</hi> ſaid, If the ſtopping be by the Terr-Tenant,
an Aſſize of Nuſans lieth; but if it be by a Stranger, then an Action
upon the Caſe; but for common Nuſanſes no Action lieth, but they
ought to be preſented in the Leet or Turne. <hi>Drew,</hi> We have ſhewed
That he who brought the Aſſize of Nuſans hath a Free-hold in the
Land; and if the Tenant be named, it is ſufficient, although it be not
ſhewed that he is Tenant of the Free-hold. And to that, all the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices
ſeemed to incline. But then it was ſhewed to the Court, that
one of the Plaintiffes in the Writ of Error had releaſed. And if that
ſhould bar his Companions, was another queſtion? And it was holden,
That the Writ of Error ſhall follow the nature of the firſt Action; and
that Summons and Severance lieth in an Aſſize of Nuſans; and
therefore it was holden, that it did the like in this Action; therefore
the Releaſe of the one was the Releaſe of the other. But then it was
asked by <hi>Glanvile,</hi> What ſhould become of the Damages, which were
entire? Note, Paſch. 29. <hi>Eliz.</hi> the Caſe was moved again, and <hi>Drew</hi>
held <hi>exaltare</hi> and <hi>erigere</hi> all one; and that <hi>erigere</hi> is not <hi>de novo facere,</hi>
for that is <hi>Levare.</hi> But the Juſtices were againſt him, who all held,
That <hi>erigere is de novo facere,</hi> and <hi>exaltare</hi> is <hi>in majorem altitudinem at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollere,</hi>
and at length the Judgment was affirmed, That <hi>Erectio</hi> and
<hi>Exaltatio</hi> were all one: For the Chief Juſtice had turned all his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions

courſe of Law. <hi>Godfrey,</hi> The plea in Bar is not good: for it is a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative

the darrein Continuance: The Demandant ſaid, It was not his
deed after the darrein Continuance: And that was holden a Negative
<hi>pregnans:</hi> wherefore he was compelled to plead and ſay, he made it

made it after the darrein continuance, and then Iſſue was taken upon it.
The ſame Caſe is in 5. <hi>H</hi> 7. 7. But there it is ſaid, That in Debt upon a

Vide 39 H. 6. The Caſe of the Dean and Chapter. The ſecond
Exception was, That he hath pleaded <hi>neque</hi> ſuch, nor ſuch, nor ſuch
had diſturbed him by any indirect means, but onely by due courſe of
Law: And that cannot be tryed, neither by Jury, nor by the Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
Not by the Jury; becauſe it is not to be put to them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they had diſturbed him by indirect means, or by due courſe of
Law: for they ſhall not take upon them the conſtruction, What is
an indirect means, and what is the due courſe of Law; for it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaineth

the Plaintiff or his Councell a ſufficient Diſcharge of an Annuity of
forty ſhillings <hi>per annum,</hi> which the Plaintiff claims out of two Meſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages

               </hi> and <hi>W.</hi> of the Plaintiffs Councell, a
ſufficient Diſcharge of the Annuity, and that they did refuſe to ſee it,
and demanded judgment of the Action. The Plaintiff did demur upon
the Plea. And after a long argument, it was adjudged by all the Juſtices
to be no Plea, &amp;c. becauſe it lay in the judgment of the Court to judg
of it: and he did not ſhew in certain, what diſcharge he tendered, as
a Releaſe. Unitie of poſſeſſion, &amp;c. If a man be bound to plead a
ſufficient plea before ſuch a day, in Debt upon ſuch a Bond; it is no
plea to ſay, That he hath pleaded a ſufficient plea before the day;
but hee ought to ſhew what plea he hath pleaded: For the Court
cannot tell whether it be a ſufficient plea or not, if it do not appear
what manner of plea it is. 35 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 19. The Condition of a Bond
was, That where the Plaintiff was indebted to <hi>J. S.</hi> in one hundred

            <p>A Caſe was moved upon the Statute of 5. <hi>Eliz. Cap.</hi> 14. The Caſe
(as I conceive) was thus: Grandfather, Father and Daughter;
Land deſcended from the Grandfather to the Father, who made a Leaſe
for one hundred years; the Father died, and the Daughter forged a Will
of the Grandfather, by which he gave the Land to the Father for life, the
Remainder to the Daughter in Fee; and the ſame was forged to have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided
an Execution of a Statute Staple, the Leaſe being defeated; and if
it were within the Statute of 5. <hi>Eliz.</hi> was the queſtion. Solicitor, That it
was within the ſtatute, and within the firſt Branch; viz. If any ſhall
forge any deed, &amp;c. to the intent that the Eſtate of Free-hold, or Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of any perſon, &amp;c. in or to any Lands, Tenements, or Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taments,
Freehold or Copyhold, or the right Title or Intereſt of any
&amp;c. of, in, or to the ſame, or any of them; ſhall or may be moleſted,
&amp;c. Leſſee for years hath a Title, hath an Intereſt, hath a right;
therefore within the words of the Statute; and thoſe words ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to the words Lands, Tenements, &amp;c. But <hi>Cook</hi> ſaid, They
ſhall be referred to the words precedent, viz. Eſtate of Freehold or
Inheritance; and then a Leaſe for years is not within them. Alſo by
the Solicitor, A Teſtament in writing is within the words of the Statute,
and therefore he recited a clauſe in the end of the Statute; viz. and if
any perſon plead, publiſh, or ſhew forth, &amp;c. to the intent to have
or claime thereby any Eſtate of Inheritance, Freehold, or Leaſe for
years: And alſo he ſaid a Statute Staple is an eſtate for years, although it
be not a Leaſe for years, becauſe it is not certain. <hi>Cook.</hi> If ſhe ſhould
be within both branches, then ſhe ſhould be twice puniſhed, which
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:40982:36"/>
Law will not ſuffer. And the Statute is, whereby any Eſtate for years
ſhall be claimed; and ſhe would not claim, but defeat an Eſtate for
years; and a Statute Staple is not a Leaſe for years; and the Statute
is not to be taken by Equity, becauſe it is a Penall Law. Solicitor,
When the Statute is extended, then it is an Eſtate for years, although
it be uncertain. If a man forge a Leaſe for years, it is directly within
the Statute. But if a man have a Leaſe, and another is forged to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat
it, it is a queſtion whether it be within the Statute: And all the
doubt of this Caſe is upon the reference of theſe words, Right, Title,
Intereſt: And it was adjourned.</p>

And the Writ was abated; For there is a difference betwixt <hi>[in]</hi>
and <hi>[de.]</hi> For a thing may be [in] and not [of,] as Saint <hi>Sepulchres</hi>
is in <hi>London,</hi> but not of <hi>London.</hi> A ſecond Exception was, becauſe it
ſaid, <hi>Inquiſitio capta per Sacramentum, &amp;c.</hi> and did not ſay, <hi>Jurati;</hi>
and therefore the partie is not charged upon it; and by 13. <hi>E.</hi> 4. If

<hi>in facto,</hi> that they were ſworn, and yet it is implyed by the words
<hi>Sacramentum ſuum,</hi> that they were ſworn. The third Exception was,
That it doth not ſay, That he was <hi>in pace Dei, &amp; dict' Dominae Reginae;</hi>
for it might be that the partie was a Traitour, and that he was flying,
and in ſuch caſe he might juſtifie the killing of him; and perhaps alſo it
was <hi>ſe defendendo;</hi> therefore thoſe words are very neceſſary. An other
Exception was, becauſe the Indictment is, <hi>percuſſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>ex malitia praecogitata,</hi> for ſo an Indictment of Murder ought to be, as
in 2. <hi>E.</hi> 4. The Indictment was, <hi>quod Cepit &amp; abduxit fel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

was, That the pan of the knee was cut out, and it doth
not ſhew, the length, depth, and breadth of the wound: he granted
that if one ſingle member be cut off, it is not neceſſary to ſhew the
breadth, &amp;c. but here was no amputation of any member, nor a cutting
off, but the cutting of the pan of the knee. <hi>Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and he finds there is a great difference betwixt cut off, and cut out.
And he ſaid, That as to that which the Solicitour hath anſwered unto,

75.</hi> the ſame Exception was taken in a Writ. But in our Caſe, he ſaid,
It is an Indictment, which is favoured, becauſe the life is in queſtion.
And he took another Exception, becauſe that the Indictment ſaies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore
feloniae &amp; murdredi praedict',</hi> and there is no ſuch word <hi>murdre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum:</hi>

and <hi>murdredum,</hi> for none of them are found amongſt the Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts.
<hi>Snag</hi> ſaid, What then? yet one is a word which is received in
the Law, and is <hi>vox artis,</hi> but the other not; and therefore it is not
in the ſame degree. Alſo he ſaid, That when the Indictment comes to

                  </gap>entes &amp; aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtentes,
&amp;c. Cook</hi> contrary; and he ſaid, That if Indictments have
ſufficient ſubſtance, they are not to be overthrown for trifles: As to
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:40982:38"/>
the firſt he ſaid, If you will have it to be <hi>(coram Coronatore de Comitatu,)</hi>
perhaps it was a Liberty; and then <hi>coram Coronatore</hi> of the Liberty,
cannot be <hi>coram Coronatore</hi> of the County. <hi>Gaudy</hi> Juſtice ſaid, that
was no anſwer. But as to this point, the Juſtices deſired that Preſidents
might be ſearched; and ſaid, that they would follow the greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of them. <hi>Clenche,</hi> If one ſay, that ſuch a one is a Juſtice of Peace in
<hi>Hertfordſhire;</hi> it is all one, as if he had ſaid a Juſtice of Peace of <hi>Hert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordſhire.</hi>
As to the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. <hi>Jurati,</hi> that is no Exception; for it is true,
that it muſt be ſo in an Aſſize, but not in an Indictment: alſo no Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident
can be ſhewed, where <hi>ex malitia propenſa ſua</hi> ſhall be applied
to every word, when it runs in ſenſe to all by Conjunctions copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.
As to the Exception, that there ought to be the length, breadth,
&amp;c. <hi>Kempe</hi> the Secondary ſaid, That it was not worth the ſtanding
upon: and as to the word <hi>Murdredi,</hi> if it had been left out, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment
had been ſufficient, and that ſhall not make the Indictment
void; for if it be left out, it doth no hurt to it: For if many come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
to make an Aſſault, <hi>ex malitia praecogitata;</hi> and one of them
onely ſtrikes the partie mortally, and he dieth, it is murder in them
all. And that was Doctor <hi>Ellis</hi> caſe in the Commentaries; and the
Indictment needs not ſay, that they were <hi>praeſentes, abbettantes &amp; aux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iliantes:</hi>
and as to the word <hi>felonicè,</hi> it goes to all the words, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
not particularly applied. Note, all the Juſtices did incline that
the Indictment was good notwithſtanding the Exceptions; but yet
they ſaid, they would adviſe of it, and look upon Preſidents.</p>

            <p>IN a Writ of Error brought upon a Record removed out of the Court

at a Court holden before <hi>William Fleetwood</hi> Steward, &amp;c. whereas it
ought to have been holden before the Suitors, for they are the Judges.
The ſecond Error was, That the Preſentment upon which the Amerce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is grounded, ſaith, That <hi>Golſton</hi> the Defendant had cut down more
Trees <hi>quam debuit, extra boſcum Domini.</hi> 1. That it is repugnant; for

for if that be not good, all is naught. Notwithſtanding it was
ſaid by one at the Bar, That the forme of pleading in the book of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries

and ſo it may be that he entred by right, viz. for not payment of the
Rent, as in truth his entry was: And if <hi>Barker</hi> did enter lawfully, then
it was no ſuſpenſion or extinguiſhment of the Covenant: As 19. <hi>R.</hi> 2.
If Leſſee for life commit waſte, and afterwards alieneth, and the Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor
entreth for the Alienation, yet after his entry he ſhall have an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Waſte againſt the Leſſee: So 8. <hi>H. 6. 10. Waste</hi> 8. but with this
difference, If the Leſſor enter wrongfully, there, although Waſte be
done before, he ſhall not have Waſte to puniſh it; but otherwiſe if he
enter for the Forfeiture done by the Tenant. Alſo if the Covenant
was ſuſpended, it was only for the time that the Leſſor had the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion,
and the Party hath not anſwered for the time before or after.
As 16. <hi>H.</hi> 7. If one be bound to find a Chaplain to ſay Divine Service
within ſuch a Chappel, and the Chappel fall down, it is a good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
for the time; but if it be built again, he muſt find a Chaplain there.
<hi>Clarke</hi> contrary; If Leſſee for years covenanteth to repair the houſes,
I grant that the ſame ſhall charge his Aſſignee. But a Collateral thing,
(as if the Leſſee covenant to pay ſuch a ſum in groſs, or to enfeoffe him
of the Manor of <hi>D)</hi> the ſame ſhall not charge the Aſſignee; no more
ſhall a Covenant to build a new houſe: But here it was ſaid, That he
had time to build it both before and after the entry of the <hi>Leſſor</hi> Barker.
To that he anſwered, Not ſo; for if he once diſturbed, the Covenant is
deſtroyed. <hi>Godfrey,</hi> This Caſe was this Terme in the Common Pleas.
Leſſee for five years covenanted to build a Mill within the terme; and
becauſe he had not done it, the Leſſor brought an Action of Covenant,
and the Defendant pleaded, That within the laſt three years, the Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor
forcibly held him out, &amp;c. ſo as he could not build it; and by the
Opinion of all the Juſtices, he ought to plead, That the Leſſor with
force held him out, otherwiſe it would be no Plea. <hi>Cook,</hi> As <hi>amicus
curiae,</hi> vouched 35. H. 6. Tit. <hi>Barr.</hi> If one be bounden to enfeoffe me
of ſuch land before <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> there the Obliger in Debt brought
upon the Bond, pleaded, That the Obligee (before the day) had entred
with force into the land, ſo as he could not enfeoffe him; and there it
was holden, That he ought to prove that he was holden out by force.
<hi>Gaudy,</hi> In the principall Caſe he ought to have ſhewed, That he would
not ſuffer him to build: And the other Juſtices ſeemed to be of the ſame
Opinion; but yet they ſaid, That they would adviſe upon the Caſe.</p>

Doddington,</hi> to reverſe a common recovery in the City
of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> upon a Writ of Right Patent: And for Error it was
aſſigned, 1. That no Warrant of Atturney was entred, but that ſuch
a one <hi>poſuit loco ſuo W. H.</hi> and did not write the name at length, but
in the Plea Roll it was at length. The ſecond Error was, That the
Writ was, <hi>De tribus meſſuagiis ſive tenementis,</hi> and that doth containe
no certainty, for <hi>[ſive]</hi> is a word uncertaine. The third Error: It
was in the time <hi>Philippi &amp; Mariae,</hi> and <hi>petit proceſſum Domini Regis &amp;

Voucher, that the Recovery was had; but if it were in the Recovery,
in which he did appear and plead, it was otherwiſe. The Counſell of
the other ſide, as to the firſt, ſaid, That all the Records of the City are
of the ſame form, viz. That ſuch a one <hi>Po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uit loco ſuo W. H. &amp;c.</hi> and if it
were not good, they ſhould be all overthrown and avoided; and if it
ſhould be otherwiſe, it ſhould be contrary to the ancient cuſtome of the
City. As to the ſecond, <hi>Quod petit proceſſum corundum Regis</hi> the
ſame is the miſrecitall of the Clark; for the Writ upon which it is
grounded is well; and as to the Proceſs, the party did appear <hi>gratis.</hi>
As to the word <hi>[ſive]</hi> the ſame is good, for <hi>tenementum</hi> is but Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pluſage;
As in an Action of Waſte, if the party do expreſſe ſome
things which are not waſte, and ſome things which are; thoſe which are
not waſte, are but Surpluſage. Alſo he ſaid, That the Writ of Error by
which the Record is removed, is inſufficient; for the Writ is, That there is
Error <hi>manefeſtus.</hi> and doth not ſay <hi>[ut dicitur,]</hi> and therefore it is not
good, for otherwiſe the King ſhould forejudge us; And alſo
in the Writ, it doth not ſay <hi>Errorem ſiquis fuerit;</hi> and it ought
not preciſely to ſay, That there is Error. Alſo the Writ of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
is to certifie a Record <hi>de tribus meſſuagiis &amp; tenementis;</hi> and
the Record is, <hi>De tribus meſſuagiis ſive tenementis;</hi> and therefore
the Record is not well removed; for it is not ſuch Record. As

               <hi>12. Aſſ.</hi> 2. in <hi>Attaint,</hi> Exception was taken, that the Writ of Attaint
did not agree with the firſt originall; but becauſe it did agree with the
Record, it was good, although it did not agree with the firſt Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall;
for the firſt Originall was of the Manor of <hi>Anſti,</hi> and the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taint
was of <hi>Aneſti,</hi> and ſo was the whole Record. But if the Attaint
had diſagreed with the Record; it had been Error. Alſo the Writ
was good, although <hi>tenementis</hi> were out of the Writ, for it is but
ſurpluſage. And alſo <hi>Tenementum</hi> is not a thing demandable; as 11.
<hi>H.</hi> 7. 25. it is ſaid, That <hi>Tenementum</hi> is not a name to demand a
Meſſuage by: but in Treſpaſs, of Nuſance to it, there <hi>Tenementum</hi> is
ſufficient. <hi>Suit</hi> Juſtice, The Record is now before us, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Writ of Error is not materiall: For if my Lord <hi>Anderſon</hi>
bring before us a Record, although no Writ of Error be awarded,
yet wee may proceed to examine Whether there be Error in it or
not. Alſo hee ſaid, that the Warrant of Atturney was not good,
although it was uſuall, for that they ought to follow the courſe of
the common Law. <hi>Clenche</hi> Juſtice, There ought to be Writ of
Error before that any Judgement upon the Errors can be given
for to reverſe the firſt Record. The reaſon wherefore the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

Plaintiff did bring ſuch a Ship to ſuch a place in <hi>Greece,</hi> and at the ſame
place ſhould ſtay for the ſpace of forty dayes, or ſo long of the forty
dayes as ſhould pleaſe the Defendant, ſo as he might freight the Ship;
the Defendant ſhould freight the Ship within forty dayes, and ſhould
bring it to ſuch a Port in <hi>England:</hi> And becauſe he had not freighted
the ſhip, and the ſhip was there by the ſpace of forty dayes, he brought
his Action upon the Bond: The Defendant pleaded, that within thoſe
forty dayes, viz. by the ſpace of four and twenty dayes, the ſaid ſhip
was laden with Hoops, ſo as the Defendant could not freight it: And
the Plaintiff did demurr in Law upon the plea. <hi>Clark</hi> for the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffe:
The Defendant hath not anſwered to all the time, but to part
onely; and he had ſufficient time, although the ſhip were laden with

Hoops for the ſpace of four and twenty dayes: as 35. <hi>H. 6. Barr.</hi> 162
The Maſter of S. <hi>Katherines</hi> leaſed three houſes by one Indenture, upon
condition that the Leſſee ſhould not ſuffer nor harbour any lewd wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
within the ſame houſes, if he were warned thereof by the Maſter
or his ſervant for the time, &amp;c. And if he did not put her out within
ſix weeks after ſuch warning, that then it ſhould be lawfull for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
and his Succeſſors to enter. And it was ſhewed, That the Leſſee
did ſuffer a lewd woman there to continue: wherefore ſuch a one, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
of the Maſter, gave him warning, &amp;c. and the Leſſee did not put her
out of the houſe, and that therefore the Maſter did enter: which
matter, &amp;c. The Leſſee ſaid, that after the ſaid warning given, that
the Maſter commanded her to enter, and to dwell there for ſix weeks
after, without that, that ſhe continued there by the Defendant. And
it was ruled by the whole Court, that the Replication was not good,
becauſe the Indenture is, That he ſhould not ſuffer any lewd woman,
&amp;c. As if I be bound to enfeoff you of an Acre of La<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d by ſuch a time,
within which time you diſſeiſe me, the ſame is no plea, for that the
Feoffer hath not colour to enter; therefore I may enter upon him,
and make the Feoffment. So in that caſe, the Maſter had no colour
to put her into poſſeſſion, therefore it was no plea, without ſhewing
the ſpeciall matter: Wherefore he ſaid, That he did put her out, and
that the Maſter with force, &amp;c. againſt the will of the Leſſee, did put
her in; and there made her to ſtay with force and violence, againſt the
will of the Leſſee, for the ſix weeks &amp;c. and that was holden to be a
good plea. So in the principall caſe, he doth not ſhew, that he was
kept out with force, but that he might caſt out the Hoops; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the plea is not good. So 3. <hi>H. 4. 8. Br. Condition</hi> 35. There was
a Covenant betwixt the Leſſor and Leſſee, That the leſſor during the
leaſe might be four dayes in a yeer in the houſe without being put out,
upon pain of one hundred pounds: and the Leſſor came to enter, and
the Leſſee ſhut the doors and the windows; It was held, that was no
breach of the Covenant, without ſaying, that the leſſee put him out.
<hi>Atkins</hi> contrary: The ſhip was to remain there to be freighted, for ſo
many dayes as it ſhould pleaſe the Defendant of the forty dayes for to
freight her: therefore the firſt act is to ariſe on the plaintiffs ſide; and
the ſame ought to be ſhewed ſpecially to have been done. As 14. <hi>H. 8.
18. Br. Condition</hi> 42. Debt upon a Bond, upon Condition That if the
Defendant reſigne the Benefice of D. unto the Plaintiff upon a Penſion,
as they may agree by a certain day, That then, &amp;c. The Defendant
ſaid, that he was always ready to reſigne to him the Benefice, and yet
is, in caſe the Plaintiff would aſſure him the Penſion. It was no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
for the Plaintiff, That he offered him a Penſion, unleſſe he

their ſpeciall names, and to their heirs, and further willed that his

ſuch a day an hundred pound; and if not, that then they ſhould

refuſed to entermeddle, and the other three ſold the Land; and
if the Sale were good, or not, was the queſtion. <hi>Cooke.</hi> The Sale is
not good. 1. Let us ſee what the Common Law is, At the Common
Law it is a plain caſe, that the Sale is not good, becauſe it is a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
truſt, and a joynt truſt, and ſhall never ſurvive: for perhaps, the
Deviſor who is dead, repoſed more confidence in him who refuſed, then
in the others. <hi>Vide 2 Eliz.</hi> the Caſe of the Lord <hi>Bray,</hi> who covenanted,
That if his ſon marry with the conſent of four, whom he eſpecially na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med:
<hi>viz. A. B. C.</hi> and <hi>D.</hi> that then he would ſtand ſeiſed to the uſe of
his ſon, and his wife, and to the heirs of their two bodies begotten;
One of the four was attainted and executed; The other did conſent
that he ſhould marry ſuch a one; he married her, yet no eſtate paſſed,
becauſe the fourth did not conſent, and it was a joynt truſt. 38. <hi>H. 8.
Br. Deviſes</hi> 31. A man willeth that his Lands deviſeable ſhall be ſold
by his Executors, and makes four Executors: all of them ought to ſell;
for the truſt which is put upon them, is a joynt Truſt. But <hi>Brook</hi>
conceiveth, that if one of them dieth, that the others may ſell the
Lands. The Caſe betwixt <hi>Vincent</hi> and <hi>Lee,</hi> was this; A man deviſed,
That if ſuch a one dieth without iſſue of his body, that then his Sons
in law ſhould ſell ſuch Lands: and there were five ſons in law when
the Teſtatour died; and when the other man died without iſſue, there
were but three ſons in law, and they ſold the Lands, and it was holden
that the Sale was good; becauſe the Land was not preſently to be ſold.
Alſo he ſaid, that in the principall Caſe here, they have an Intereſt in
the Lands, and each of them hath a part; therefore the one cannot
ſell without the other. But if the deviſe were, that four ſhould ſell;
they have not an Intereſt, but onely an Authority. As to the Statute
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:40982:44"/>
of 21. <hi>H.</hi> 8. Cap. 4. he ſaid, that that left our Caſe to the Common
Law: For that Statute, as it appeareth by the preamble, ſpeaks onely
of ſuch Deviſes by which the Land is deviſed to be ſold by the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors,
and not deviſed to the Executors to ſell. And goes further,
and ſaith, Any ſuch Teſtament, &amp;c. of any ſuch perſon, &amp;c. therefore
it is meant of ſuch a deviſe made unto the Executors; and then no
Intereſt paſſeth, but onely an Authority, or a bare Truſt: But in our
Caſe, they have an Intereſt, for he who refuſed, had a fourth part; Then
when the other ſell the whole, the ſame is a diſſeiſin to him of his
part. If a Feoffment be made to four, upon condition that they make a
Feoffment over; and two of them make the Feoffment, it is not good.
Alſo the words of the Will prove, that they have an Intereſt; for it
is, that his Deviſees ſhall ſell, &amp;c. <hi>Laiton</hi> contrary, And he ſaid, That
although the Deviſe be to them by their proper names, and not by the
name Executors; yet the intent appeareth that they were to ſell as
Executors, becauſe it was to the performance of his laſt Will; and that
may be performed as well by the three, although that the other doth
refuſe; and the Sale of the Land doth referre to the performance of
his Will, in which there are divers Debts and Legacies appointed
to be paid. 2. <hi>H.</hi> 4. and 3. <hi>H.</hi> 6. A man deviſed his Lands to be ſold for
the payment of his debts, and doth not name who ſhall ſell the ſame,
the Lands ſhall be ſold by his Executors. 39. <hi>Aſſ.</hi> A Deviſe is of
Lands unto Executors, to ſell for the performance of his Will, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
of the Lands before the Sale ſhall be aſſets in the Executors hands.
<hi>15. H.</hi> 7. 12. is, That if a man deviſe, that his Lands ſhall be ſold, they
ſhall be ſold by his Executors. Alſo if I deviſe that my Executors ſhall
ſell my Lands, and they ſell, it is an Adminiſtration, and afterwards
they cannot plead, that they never were Executors, nor never admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred
as Executors; And although there are divers Authorities to be
executed, yet it is but one Truſt. 39. <hi>Aſſ.</hi> 17. is our very Caſe. A
man ſeiſed of Lands deviſeable, deviſed them to his Executors to ſell,
and died, having two Executors, and one of them died, and the other
entred and ſold the Land; and the Sale was good. 49. <hi>E. 3. 15. Iſabell
Goodcheapes</hi> Caſe; Where a man deviſed, that after an Eſtate in taile
determined, that his Executors ſhould ſell the Lands, and made three
Executors, and one died, and another refuſed, the third after the taile
determined, ſold the Land; and the Sale was holden good, and that it
ſhould not eſcheate to the Lord, for the Land was bound with a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe,
as with a Condition; as to the Statute of 21. <hi>H.</hi> 8. Cap. 4. the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble
of the Statute is, as it hath been recited: and although for exma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
the Lands in uſe are only put, yet the Statute is not tied only to that;
As in the Statute of Colluſion of <hi>Malbridge;</hi> Examples are put only
of Feoffments and Leaſes for years, yet there is no doubt but that a
Leaſe for life, or a gift in taile to defraud the Lord, is within the Statute.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:40982:44"/>
So the Statute of <hi>Donis Conditionalibus</hi> puts onely three manner of
eſtate tailes. But <hi>Littleton</hi> ſaith, That there are many other eſtate
tailes, which are not recited in the Statute: So here, our Caſe is
within the Miſchiefe of the Statute of 21. <hi>H.</hi> 8. Cap. 4. although it be
not within the Example. So the Statute of <hi>Weſt.</hi> 1. is, That if the
Gardien or Leſſee for years, maketh a Feoffment in Fee, <hi>Tam Feofa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
quam feofatus habeantur pro diſſeiſoribus:</hi> yet 22. <hi>Aſſ.</hi> is, That
if Tenant by <hi>Elegit</hi> make a Feoffment, it is within the Statute. Alſo
it may be a doubt, Whether Land deviſable onely by cuſtome bee
intended in the Statute of 21. <hi>H.</hi> 8. Cap. 4. And whether Land devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable
by the Statute of 32. <hi>H.</hi> 8. be within it or not, <hi>viz.</hi> If a Statute
of a pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſne time ſhall be taken by Equity within a more Ancient
Statute: and I conceive it may; as 12. <hi>H.</hi> 7. the Statue of 4. <hi>H.</hi> 7.
which ſayes that the heire of <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe</hi> ſhall be in Ward, ſhall
extend to the Statute of <hi>Praerogativa Regis;</hi> for if he be in Ward to the
King, he ſhall have Prerogative in the Lands, to have other Lands by
reaſon thereof. <hi>Gaudy</hi> Juſtice did rely very much upon the word <hi>[De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſees,]
viz.</hi> that they have an Intereſt, and that the Sale was not
good. <hi>Suit</hi> Juſtice, They are both Executors and Deviſees of the
Lands; Deviſees of the Lands, and Executors to performe the Will.
<hi>Cook,</hi> he who refuſed to ſell, cannot waive the Freehold, which is in
him by a refuſall in <hi>pars,</hi> as 7. <hi>H.</hi> 2. and 7. <hi>E.</hi> 4. but ought to waive
it in a Court of Record; therefore he hath an Intereſt remaining in
him. <hi>Clenche</hi> Juſtice; What if he had deviſed the Lands to four,
and made one of them his Executors, and willed that he ſhould ſell;
could not he ſell? All the Court agreed that he might. <hi>Cook,</hi> When
a man deviſeth that his Executors ſhall ſell, the Fee deſcends to the
heir; yet they may ſell that which is in another: but the ſame is not
like to our Caſe. It was adjourned.</p>

was of the whole, but becauſe the Defendant had not ſo much, he

            <p>AM Action upon the Caſe upon a Promiſe was brought; but the
Caſe was ſo long that I could not take it: But in that Caſe,
<hi>Tanfield,</hi> who argued for the Defendant, ſaid, That it is not lawfull for
any man to meddle in the cauſe of another, if he have not an Intereſt in
the thing, for otherwiſe it will be Maintenance. But if a Cuſtome be
in queſtion betwixt the Lord of the Manor and Copy-holder; all the
other Copy-holders of the Manor may expend their money in mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of the other and the Cuſtome; and the Maſter may expend the
money of the ſervant in maintenance of the ſervant: So he in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
may maintain him who hath the particular Eſtate. Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
is an odious thing in the Law, for it doth encreaſe troubles and
Suites. He argued alſo, How that Bonds, Obligations, and Special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
might be aſſigned over, how not. 34. <hi>H. 6. 30. Br. Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
8.</hi> If <hi>J. S.</hi> be indebted to me, and I be indebted to <hi>J. D.</hi> I may
aſſign that Debt to <hi>J. D.</hi> with the aſſent of <hi>J. S.</hi> otherwiſe not, as I
conceive. And there alſo another difference is taken, That Damages
which are to be recovered for Treſpaſs, Battery, &amp;c. cannot be aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
over, becauſe they are as yet uncertain; and perhaps the Aſſignee
may be a man of great power, who might procure a Jury to give him
the greator Damages. If a Bond be for performance of Covenants
contained in an Indenture of Leaſe, if he aſſign the Leaſe, he may aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
the Bond alſo, becauſe they are concomitants; and he hath an
Intereſt in the Leaſe, and therefore he may ſue the Bond: But if the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:40982:46"/>
Covenants be firſt broken, and afterwards he aſſign over the Leaſe, if
the Aſſgnee ſue the Bond, it is directly Maintenance: but if he aſſign
over the Leaſe, and afterwards the Covenants are broken, if he ſue
there it is no Maintenance: But if he aſſign over the Bond, and reſerve
the Leaſe in his own hands, and then the Covenants are broken, and the
other ſue the Bond for the performance of Covenants, it is Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance:
And to all that <hi>Cook</hi> agreed. The ſecond Point; An <hi>Elegit</hi> is
awarded to the Sheriffe, and he extends the Lands, and doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
it; Whether it be a lawfull Execution to the party or not? is the
queſtion. It is a good Execution, unleſſe the words of the Writ be
conditionall, for then there muſt be a returne of the Writ; as a <hi>Fieri
facias</hi> muſt be returned, otherwiſe the Execution is not well done, for
it is conditionall, viz. <hi>Ita quod habeas pecuniam in curia, &amp;c.</hi> So is it
of a <hi>Capias ad ſatisfaciendum, Ita quod habeas corpus hîc.</hi> But an <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git</hi>
is not conditionall. Yet <hi>Kemp</hi> the Secondary ſaid, That in the end
of the <hi>Elegit</hi> is, <hi>Et de eo quod inde feceris nobis in dicta cancellaria tali
die ubicunque tunc fuerit ſub Sigillo diſtinctè &amp; apertè conſtare facias, &amp;c.</hi>
And ſo is the forme of the Writ in <hi>Fitz. Nat. Br. 266. Tanfield.</hi> That
is true, but it doth not make the Writ conditionall: but that is the
Entry of the Court and the Sheriffe, and not the Entry of the Party
and the Sheriff. 11. <hi>H.</hi> 4. 59. by <hi>Hankford,</hi> who was a man of great
knowledge, and lived in learned times. If the Recogniſee of a Statute
Merchant ſueth Execution of it, although the Writ be not returned,
and the Recogniſee hath Execution, and afterwards the Recogniſor
purchaſeth other Lands; and afterwards the Recogniſee comes and
ſaies, That the Writ is not returned, and ſues forth another Writ,
the Recogniſor ſhall have an <hi>Audita querela</hi> in that Caſe, and ſhall
ſurmiſe in Fact, how that execution was done by the firſt Writ, and
yet there is no Record that execution was done by the firſt Writ. So
<hi>19. E. 3. Briefe</hi> 370. A Writ iſſued to have Execution in forty
Towns, and an Extent was made, and delivered of Lands in forty
Towns; and the Return made mention but of Execution in eight Towns,
and therefore the Party would have had a new Writ; and the other
Party was received to averre againſt the Record of the Returne, that
the Extent was in forty Towns. 12. <hi>E. 3. Scire facias</hi> 117. Upon an
<hi>Elegit</hi> the Sheriffe returned <hi>extendi feci,</hi> and did not ſay, <hi>deliberavi;</hi>
and in truth, he did deliver the Lands in extent, and therefore he could
not have a new Execution. 20. <hi>Eliz.</hi> betwixt <hi>Colſill</hi> and <hi>Haſtings.
Colſill</hi> had an extent upon the Lands of <hi>Haſtings,</hi> and the Sheriffe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a friend to <hi>Haſtings,</hi> did not deliver full Poſſeſſion to <hi>Colſill,</hi> but
gave him Poſſeſſion in one part in the name of all the others. <hi>Haſtings</hi>
continued Poſſeſſion of all the reſt, and being upon Election of new She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs,
<hi>Colſill</hi> was not over haſty to put him out, for he was in hope to
have a more favourable Sheriffe; and the firſt Writ was not returned,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:40982:46"/>
and there being a new Sheriff, he ſued forth a new Writ to have Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The Defendant ſaid, That he had before ſued forth the like Writ, and
had Execution. And <hi>Colſill</hi> ſaid, That the firſt Writ was not returned;
and yet the Opinion of the whole Court was, That it was a good Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution,
and ſo it was ruled; but the Caſe was overthrown afterwards
upon another Point. So the Earle of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> had a Statute extended
upon the Land of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Tanfields</hi> Mother; and it was not returned;
and yet when he would have ſued forth another Execution, he could not
have it allowed him by the rule of the Court, becauſe the firſt Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was a good Execution, although it were not returned. 15 <hi>Eliz.</hi>
It was the Caſe of the Counteſſe of <hi>Derby,</hi> who married the Earle of
Kent: in an <hi>Habere facias ſeiſinam</hi> in a Writ of Dower, Execution was
ſerved, but not returned, and therefore ſhe prayed a new Writ, but
could not obtain it, becauſe the firſt was well executed, although it was
not returned. So alſo was the Lord <hi>Morleyes</hi> Caſe in the Kings Bench,
in 28. <hi>Eliz.</hi> the Writ was not returned, and yet the Execution was
well done: And therefore he concluded, That the Execution was
good, although the Writ was not returned. <hi>Cook</hi> contrary, An <hi>Elegit</hi>
ought to be returned, and it is void if it be not returned. As to the Caſe
before cited of 19. <hi>E.</hi> 3. which began 9. <hi>E.</hi> 3. 450. And all the other
Caſes put out of the old Books, They are upon extents of Statutes;
and there is a great difference betwixt an <hi>Elegit</hi> and Extents upon Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes;
as 15. <hi>H.</hi> 7. 14. It was agreed, That where a man recovers
Debt or Damages, or hath a Recogniſance forfeit unto him, his Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors
ſhall not have Execution, without a <hi>Scire facias</hi> firſt ſued; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
upon a Statute Staple or Merchant; and the like if the Defendant
dieth, the Plaintiffe ſhall not have an Execution by <hi>Fieri facias</hi> againſt
his Executors, but he muſt firſt have a <hi>Scire facias:</hi> So if the Court
change, as if the Record cometh into the Kings Bench by Error, and
Judgement be affirmed; the Plaintiffe who recovered, ſhall not have a
<hi>Fieri facias</hi> againſt the Defendant, but muſt firſt have a <hi>Scire facias:</hi>
But otherwiſe it is of a Statute, like the Caſe of 14. <hi>H. 7. 15. Br: Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
59.</hi> The Caſe of 12. <hi>E.</hi> 3. doth not ſpeak of <hi>Elegit,</hi> but of
Statutes and Extents. Alſo the <hi>Elegit</hi> and the Extent differ in
the Entrie; for the <hi>Elegit</hi> hath a ſpeciall and preciſe Entry, as
<hi>Elegit ſibi executionem, &amp;c.</hi> And a man ſhall not have a <hi>Capias</hi>
after an <hi>Elegit;</hi> as 15. <hi>H.</hi> 7. is: And being a ſpeciall Entry of
Record, it ought to be returned; for otherwiſe it doth not appear
that Execution is done; and ſo there ſhall be great miſchiefe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
infinite Executions may iſſue forth. There is not any Book
in the Law directly in the Point: But I will put you as ſtrong
a Caſe: A Judgement is given upon an Exigent by the Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor;
yet by 28. <hi>Aſſ.</hi> 49. If there be no Returne of the Exigent, it is
no ſufficient Out-lawry; and one Pleaded the ſame in the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaintiffe,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:40982:47"/>
and ſaid, that it appeared by the Record, and vouched the
Record: and becauſe the <hi>Exigent</hi> was not returned, it was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.
And ſo was the Caſe of <hi>Procter</hi> and <hi>Lambert,</hi> 4 &amp; 5. <hi>Philip</hi>
and <hi>Marie</hi> adjudged. As to the Reports which are not printed,
vouched by <hi>Tanfield, eâdem facilitate negantur quâ affirmantur.</hi> Upon
an <hi>Elegit,</hi> if there be goods ſufficient, the Sheriff is not to meddle with
the Lands; and if there be not ſufficient goods, yet hee is not to
meddle with the beaſts of the plough. If a man have an Authoritie,
and he doth leſſe then his Authoritie, all is void; as here the Return of
the Writ is part of his Authority. As 12. <hi>Aſſ.</hi> 24. If a man have a letter
of Atturney to make Livery and Seiſin to two, and he makes it to one,
all is void, and he is a diſſeiſor to the Feoffor. So 4. <hi>H.</hi> 7. If he have
a letter of Atturney to make Livery of three Acres, and he makes onely
Livery of two Acres, and not of the third Acre, it is void for the whole.
Alſo the <hi>Elegit</hi> is, <hi>Quod extendi facias &amp; liberari, quouſ<expan>

that the beſt ſhall be taken for the King; but if it had been in the Caſe

another which gives partition for years, or for life; and he doth not
ſhew in which of the Statutes it is. As if one claime by a Feoffment
of <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe,</hi> as 4. <hi>H.</hi> 7. is, he ought to ſhew, that the <hi>Ceſtuy
que uſe</hi> was of full age at the time of the Feoffment, &amp;c. for it is not
a good Feoffment, if he be not of full age. So here he ought to ſhew,
that he is ſeized of ſuch an eſtate, of which by the Statute he may have
a Writ of Partition. For in many Caſes there ſhall be Joynt-Tenants,
and yet the one ſhall not have a Writ of Partition againſt the other
by any Statute. As if a Statute Merchant be acknowledged to two; and
they ſue for the execution upon it, I conceive, that the one ſhall not
have partition againſt the other. So if two Joynt-Tenants bee of a
Seignorie, and the Tenant dieth without heir, ſo as the Lands eſcheat
to them, they are Joynt-Tenants, and yet Partition doth not lye
betwixt them by any Statute: Therefore one may be ſeiſed <hi>pro indiviſo,</hi>
and yet the ſame ſhall not entitle him to a Writ of Partition. <hi>Shut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleworth,</hi>
contrary. The Statute doth not give any forme of Writ, but
the Writ which was at the Common Law before; And therefore it
is not to be recited, what kind of Writ he is to have. As to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
point, It is not neceſſary to ſhew the eſtate, becauſe it cannot
be intended, that he hath knowledge of the eſtate of the Defendant.
For<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if one plead Joynt-tenancy on the part of the Plaintiffe,
hee ſhall not ſhew of whoſe gift: but if the Defendant or Tenant
plead Joynt-tenancy of his part, he ought to ſhew of whoſe gift, and
how, 7. <hi>E. 6. Plo. Com. Partridges</hi> caſe. In a Caſe upon the Statute
of Maintenance. The Plaintiffe may ſay, That he accepted a Leaſe,
and ſhall not be forced to ſhew the beginning or the end of it, or for
what years it is. In the Caſe of the Indictment before: and the Caſe
of ſeverall <hi>Precipes</hi> of ſeverall Acres in ſeverall Towns, that lyeth in
the Plaintiffs Cogniſance. But here, how can the Plaintiffe know the
Defendants eſtate, becauſe he may change it as often as he pleaſeth;
and therefore it is uncertain; for if before he had a Fee, hee might
paſſe away the ſame unto another, and take back an eſtate for years.
Alſo the Plaintiffe hath appeared, and pleaded to the Declaration;
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:40982:48"/>
And therefore he ſhall not have a Writ of Error. <hi>Gaudy</hi> Juſtice, That
is not ſo. <hi>Shuttleworth;</hi> True, if there be matter of Error apparant.
<hi>Gaudy</hi> Juſtice, Cannot you take notice of your own eſtate? <hi>Cook.</hi> The
Declaration is not good; therefore the Writ of Error is maintainable.
By the Common Law, No partition lieth betwixt Tenants in common,
as theſe are. And the Statute of 31. <hi>H.</hi> 8. gives Partition onely of an
eſtate of Inheritance, and preſcribes alſo that the Writ ſhall be devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in the Chancery: there he conceived the Ancient Writ is not to
be uſed. I grant for a generall rule, That if a Statute in a new Caſe
give an old Writ; he ſhall not ſay <hi>Contra formam Statuti,</hi> becauſe it
is not needfull to recite the Statute, or make mention of it. And the
Statute of 32. <hi>H.</hi> 8. Cap. 32. ſayes, That the Writ ſhall bee deviſed
upon his, or their Caſe, or Caſes; If one bring a Writ upon the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of 31. <hi>H.</hi> 8. It is not neceſſary to ſhew of what eſtate he is ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
but <hi>de haereditate</hi> generally. But upon 32. <hi>H.</hi> 8. he ought to ſhew
of what eſtate, <hi>viz.</hi> for years, or for life. As it was in the Caſe where
Sir <hi>Anthony Cook,</hi> and <hi>Temple,</hi> and <hi>Wood</hi> were parties; which Caſe is
in <hi>Bendloes</hi> Reports, <hi>Mich.</hi> 7. &amp; 8. <hi>Eliz.</hi> which was a great Caſe
twice ſtood upon, and argued. And the reaſon there is given, That
every Caſe is not within the Statute; and if at the common Law,
and not within the Statute, the Writ ſhall not be grounded upon the
Statute. For in the Caſe before, they might have Partition at the
common Law, as one Co-parcener againſt the Alienee of the other Co-parcener
may have. Alſo he ſaid, That ſeverall Judgements are to be
given as the Caſe is, upon the ſeverall Statutes: for the Judgement
upon the firſt Statute of 31. <hi>H.</hi> 8. of Inheritances is, <hi>Sit firma partitio
in perpetuum;</hi> but upon the Statute of 32. <hi>H.</hi> 8. it is not ſo; for Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
given upon that Statute ſhall not bind him in the Reverſion;
for there is a <hi>Proviſo</hi> in the Statute in the end of it, That Partition
made by force of that Statute ſhall not be prejudiciall or hurtfull to
any perſons, other then ſuch who be parties to the ſaid Partition, their
Executors, or Aſſignes. But here it is obſerved, That by intendment
he cannot have knowledge of his eſtate. <hi>Anſw.</hi> That is at his perill:
For if he cannot have knowledge of his eſtate, there cannot be any
Partition upon any of the Statutes. If he will have benefit of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,
he ought to ſhew that he is within the Statute; and if he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſhew it, then it muſt remaine at the common Law. But it hath
been objected, that we have confeſſed the Declaration to bee good,
becauſe we have appeared and pleaded: I anſwer, That if the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
want ſubſtance, it ſhall never bee made good by Plea,
or Confeſſion. But if it want circumſtance, that perhaps may
bee made good by pleading, or confeſſion. <hi>Tanfield</hi> contrary.
Two principall things are alleadged for Errour; That the
Declaration is uncertaine in the Eſtate, and that it is uncertaine
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:40982:48"/>
in the Statute. I may know my own Eſtate, but not the Eſtate of
my Companion, for it is uncertain, and he may ſecretly change it when
he pleaſeth. But then <hi>Cook</hi> ſaid, It muſt remaine as at the common
Law. <hi>Itane?</hi> Then farewell Statute; for it may eaſily be defrauded,
and no uſe of it; for if I cannot know the Eſtate, I cannot have an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
upon the Statute; but our Caſe is better, for our Caſe is, that
<hi>recuſat facere partitionem contra formam Statuti in hoc caſu proviſam:</hi>
and that is according to the Statute; for be the Eſtate an Eſtate of
Inheritance, Free-hold, or Leaſe for Years, we leave it indifferent
to be referred to the conſideration of the Law; and according as our
Caſe ſhall fall out. Alſo it is but an Incertainty, and you have plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to it, and therefore it is no Error; but I grant that if it were mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of ſubſtance, that it were Error. Yet <hi>Fitz. Nat. Br. 21. d.</hi> In a
Writ of Entrie <hi>Sur diſſeiſin,</hi> if the Originall Writ want theſe words, viz.
<hi>Quam clamat eſſe jus &amp; haereditatem ſuam:</hi> If the Tenant do admit of
the Writ, and plead to the Action, and loſeth, he ſhall not aſſigne the
ſame for Error, becauſe he hath admitted the Writ to be good by his
Plea. So in Detinue of Charters concerning Lands, if the Plaintiffe
in his Count or Declaration doth not declare the certainty of the
Land, &amp;c. if the Defendant doth admit of the Count or Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and plead, the Declaration is made good. As to the Judgement,
If the word <hi>Inperpetuum</hi> be in it, either in the one Caſe or in the other,
it ſhall be conſtrued, to be but during the Eſtate. In a Writ of Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
there are two Judgements; the firſt, That <hi>Fiet Partitio;</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
When the Partition is made and returned; the Judgement is, That
<hi>ſtet firma &amp; ſtabilis Partitio. Gawdy</hi> Juſtice, The Writ is to be devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
upon his or their Caſe or Caſes, therefore the Party ought to ſhew
his Caſe in ſpeciall, and what Eſtate he hath. And it is no anſwer, that
he cannot know the Eſtate of the Defendant: for in a <hi>Precipe</hi> at the
common Law, he ought to take notice of the Eſtate of the Tenant, or
otherwiſe his Writ ſhall abate for the miſpriſion of it; for if he bring
it againſt a Termor it is not good. And if the Statute of 31. <hi>H.</hi> 8.
had only been made, and not the Statute of 32. <hi>H.</hi> 8. If he had brought
a Writ of Partition upon the Statute; he ought to have ſhewed that he
had an Eſtate of Inheritance againſt whom he brought the Writ. <hi>Suit</hi>
Juſtice agreed with <hi>Tanfield</hi> in the whole. <hi>Gawdy</hi> was ſtrongly of the
other ſide, That he ought to ſhew within the purview of which Statute
he was; and if he will enable himſelf by Law to bring the Writ, he muſt
enable himſelfe to be within the Law. And he ſaid, That <hi>Temples</hi> Caſe
was adjudged, as it was accordingly vouched by <hi>Cook</hi> before.</p>

to ſhew in what Action the firſt Perjury was committed; for if hee
ſay in Treſpaſſe, whereas in truth it was in Debt, all is naught. <hi>Gaudy</hi>
Juſtice, If no Action be alledged, he cannot ſue upon the Statute of
<hi>5. Eliz.</hi> But the Caſe was upon a ſpeciall Verdict, and the Verdict
did find that the Action was brought at another time then any of the

If the word Coſener had been left out, it had been a cleer Caſe that the

We are to go ſtrongly againſt theſe kind of Actions: If the words

they conceived, That but the Reverſion of one Cloſe paſſed, and
alſo that the rent ſhould not be apportioned in that Caſe, becauſe a

110 COSTARD and WINGFIELD'S Caſe.</head>
            <p>IN a Replevin, the Defendant did avow for Damage Feaſans by the
commandment of his Maſter the Lord <hi>Cromwell:</hi> The Plaintiffe by
way of Replication did juſtifie the putting in of his Cattell into the
Land, in which, &amp;c. by reaſon that the Towne of N. is an ancient
Town, and that there hath been a uſage, time out of mind, That eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Inhabitant of the ſame Towne had had common for all his cattel
Levant and Couchant in the ſame Town; and ſo juſtified the putting
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:40982:53"/>
in of his cattell. The Defendant ſaid, That the houſe in which the
Plaintiffe did inhabite in the ſame Towne, and by reaſon of Reſidency
in which houſe he claimed common, was a new houſe built within 30
years, and within that time there had not been any houſe there; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that Plea, the Plaintiffe did demurr in Law. <hi>Shuttleworth</hi> Serdeant
for the Plaintiffe, That he ſhall have common for cauſe of Reſiance in
that new houſe; and the Reſiancy is the cauſe and not the Land, nor
the Perſon; and to that purpoſe he cited 15 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 29. And he agreed
the Caſe, That if the Lord improve part of the Common, that he ſhall
not have common for the Reſidue, becauſe of the ſame Land newly
improved; for he cannot preſcribe for that which is improved by 5. <hi>Aſſ</hi>
2. But here he doth preſcribe not in the perſon, or in, or for a new thing;
but that the uſage of the Towne hath been, That the Inhabitants ſhall
have common, and that common is not appendent, nor appertinent,
nor in groſſe, by <hi>Needham 37 H. 6. 34. b.</hi> Beſides he ſaid, That if the
houſe of a Freeholder who hath uſed to have ſuch common fall down,
and he build it up again in another place of the Land, that he ſhall have
common as before. And he put a difference betwixt the caſe of <hi>Eſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi>
and this Caſe; where a new Chimney is ſet up, for that makes a
new matter of charge: and he much ſtood upon the manner of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription.
<hi>Gaudy</hi> Serjeant contrary, and he took Exception to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription;
for he ſaith, that it is <hi>antiqua villa,</hi> and doth not ſay time
out of mind; and ſuch is the Preſcription in 15. <hi>E. 4. 29. a.</hi> and if it be
not a Town time out of mind, &amp;c. he cannot preſcribe that he hath u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
time out of mind, &amp;c. And he ſaid, That if it ſhould be Law, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one who builds a new houſe ſhould have common, it ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall
to the Ancient Tenants, or impaire the common: And ſo one
who hath but a little land might build 20 houſes, and ſo an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,

Juſtice, If it ſhould be Law, that he ſhould have common, then the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of improvement which the Statute giveth to the Lord ſhall be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away by this means by ſuch new buildings, which is not reaſon: So
as all the Juſtices were of opinion, That he ſhould not have common: but
Judgement was reſpited untill they had copies of the Record. And
<hi>Hillary</hi> Term following, the Caſe was moved again; and <hi>Anderſon</hi>
and <hi>Periam</hi> were of Opinion as they were before, and for the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.
But <hi>Windham</hi> Juſtice did incline to the contrary: But they did all
allow, That he who new bulids an old Chimney ſhall have Eſtovers,
ſo a houſe common. So if a houſe fall down, and the Tenant build it up
again in another place. <hi>Periam,</hi> If a man hath a Mill and a Watercourſe
time out of mind, which he hath uſed to cleanſe; if the Mill fall
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:40982:54"/>
down, and he ſet up a new Mill, he ſhall have the liberty to cleanſe
the Watercourſe as he had before. And that Terme Judgement was

was for not payment at ſuch a Feaſt in ſuch a year. The Defendant
ſaid, That hee paid it at the Feaſt; upon which they were at iſſue.
And upon evidence given to the Jury, it appeared, That the ſame
was not paid at the Feaſt, but in eight dayes after it was paid.
And the opinion of the Court was, That by his pleading, that hee
had paid it at ſuch a day certain, and tendring that for a ſpeciall
iſſue, That hee had made the day part of the iſſue, and then
the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Defendant ought to have proved the payment upon the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

            <p>IT was the opinion of <hi>Anderſon</hi> Chiefe Juſtice, and ſo entred by the
Court, That if a Copie-holder doth ſurrender to him who hath
a Leaſe for years of the Mannor, to the uſe of the ſame Leſſee, That
the Copie-hold eſtate is extinct: For the eſtate in the Copie-hold is
not of right, but an eſtate at will, although that cuſtome and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
had fortified it. And <hi>Wray</hi> ſaid, That it had been reſolved
by good opinion, That if a Copie-holder accept a Leaſe for years of the
Mannor, that the Copie-hold eſtate is extinct for ever.</p>

               <hi>Anderſon</hi> Chiefe Juſtice, and <hi>Periam</hi> Juſtice, being abſent in a
Commiſſion upon the Queen of <hi>Scots, Shuttleworth</hi> moved this
caſe to the Court. If the Queen give Lands in taile to hold in <hi>Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,</hi>
And afterwards granteth the Reverſion, how the Donee ſhall hold?
<hi>Windham</hi> Juſtice, and <hi>Fenner</hi> Serjant, The tenure in this caſe is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
to the Reverſion; and the Donee ſhall hold of the Queen,
as in groſſe; and ſo two Tenures in <hi>Capite,</hi> for one and the ſame Land.
And thereupon, <hi>Windham</hi> Juſtice cited 30. <hi>H. 8. Dyer</hi> 45, 46. That
the Queen by no way can ſever the tenure in chiefe from the Crown.
And therefore, if the Queen do releaſe to her Tenant in <hi>Capite,</hi> to
hold by a penny, and not in <hi>Capite,</hi> it is a void Releaſe; for the
ſame is meerly incident to the Perſon and Crown of the Queen. But
<hi>Rodes</hi> Juſtice, held the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Tenure in <hi>Capite</hi> doth not
remain. But it was ſaid by <hi>Windham,</hi> That if the Queen had reſerved a
Rent upon the gift in tail, the Grantee of the Reverſion ſhould have
it; Alſo he ſaid, That the Queen might have made the Tenure in ſuch
manner: <hi>viz.</hi> to hold of the Mannor, or of the Honor of <hi>D. Shuttle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth.</hi>
If Lands holden of the Mannor of <hi>D.</hi> come to the King, may
he give them to be holden of the Mannor of <hi>S?</hi> that ſhould be hard.
<hi>Windham,</hi> I did not ſay, That Lands holden of one Mannor may be
given to be holden of another Mannor; perhaps that may not bee,
but Lands which is parcell of any Mannor, may be given <hi>

taile, with divers Remainders over, upon condition that if any
of them alien, or &amp;c. that then he who is next heir to him to whom the
land ought to come after his deceaſe, if the ſaid alienation had not been
made, might enter, and enjoy the land as if he had been dead. (But <hi>Ady</hi>
of the Temple ſaid, That the words of the Deviſe are, viz. That if any
of them alien, or &amp;c. that then his eſtate to ceaſe, and hee in the next
Remainder to enter and retain the land untill the aliener were dead.)
<hi>Rodes</hi> Juſtice, The Deviſe is good; and an eſtate may ceaſe in ſuch
manner, ſo as it ſhall not be determined for ever, but that his Heir after
him ſhall have it. And he put the caſe of <hi>Scholaſtica, Plow. Com.</hi> 408.
where <hi>(Weſton fo. 4. 14.)</hi> was in ſome doubt, that if the Tenant in talle had
had Iſſue, if the Iſſue ſhould be excluded from the land; or whether
hee ſhould have the land by the intent of the Deviſor? And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if it were neceſſary to ſhew that the Tenant in taile had not Tſſue?
But <hi>Dyer</hi> ſaid, that the words of the Will were, that ſuch perſon and his

by expreſſe words is to be determined for ever. But it is otherwiſe in

            <p>IN a <hi>Formedon,</hi> the Tenant pleaded a Fine with proclamations: The

of the Fine which remained with the Chyrographer, did warrant the
Plea; and the Record which did remain with the <hi>Cuſtos Brevium</hi> did
not warrant the Plea: and both the Records were ſhewed in Court;

To that which was ſhewed by the <hi>Cuſtos Brevium:</hi> and he cited the

that it appeared by the Record which was ſhewed by the <hi>Cuſtos

There is no ſuch matter in the ſame caſe. And 26. <hi>El.</hi> by all the Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

that the Defendant might be diſcharged out of Execution, becauſe
the Authority of the Adminiſtrator is now determined; and he

Juſtice, Although the Authority<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the Plaintiffe bee determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
yet the Recovery and the Judgement do remaine in force.
But perhaps you may have an <hi>Audita querela.</hi> But I conceive,
That ſuch an Adminiſtrator cannot have an Action; for he is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as a Bayliff to the Infant Executor, then an Adminiſtrator.
<hi>Rodes</hi> agreed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with him, and he ſaid, I have ſeen ſuch a Caſe before

ſum of money to him, his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Heirs, Executors, or Aſſignes:
And the Obligee made an Infant his Executor, and adminiſtration
was committed during his minority, and the Obligor paid the
money to that Adminiſtrator; And it was a doubt whether the
ſame was ſufficient, and ſhould excuſe him, or not. And whether
he ought not to have tendred the money to them both. <hi>Fenner,</hi>
That is a ſtronger Caſe then our Caſe: One who is Executor
of his own wrong, may pay Legacies, and receive Debts, but
he cannot bring an Action. <hi>Windham,</hi> Doth it appear by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
when the Infant was made Executor, and that Adminiſtration

Where he claimes in Fee generally, and it is found againſt him, there
perhaps hee ſhall forfeit his Eſtate; but where he ſhewes a ſpeciall

Eſtate thereby ſhould bee forfeited, although it be found againſt

that if any did the contrary, that he ſhould forfeit for the firſt fault

were eighteen Buſhels, which, he ſaid, was a very great Deceit and
Miſchief. And 2. they ſaid, That is againſt reaſon, that any Freeman

it might concerne the Inheritances of ſome who might have Sand

that they did arrogate to themſelves too high Authority: And

a <hi>Venire facias</hi> was awarded to the Sheriffe of <hi>London,</hi> and it was found
for the Plaintiffe, and damages four hundred pound. And now it was
moved in arreſt of judgement, that there was no good triall, nor the

in ſeverall Counties: <hi>viz.</hi> the Oath which was in the Exchequer, and
that ought to have been tried in <hi>Middleſex,</hi> and the matter which he
affirmed by his oath to be, viz. the demand and refuſall to pay the

is there is to be tried. And the iſſue viz. <hi>de injuria ſua propria abſque tali
cauſa</hi> goeth to both; for the <hi>ubi revera</hi> will not mend the caſe, as
<hi>Periam</hi> Juſtice ſaid, and both are materiall; for the Defendant ought
to prove, that the Plaintiffe made ſuch oath, and alſo that the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
and matter of the oath was not true, for otherwiſe the Plaintiffe
cannot be proved perjured. And therefore the Counties here (if they
might) ſhould have joyned in the triall. And the opinion of the
Court was againſt the Plaintiffe; for <hi>Anderſon</hi> and <hi>Windham</hi> ſaid,
That if this iſſue could have been tried by any one of the Counties
without the other, It ſhould be moſt properly and naturally tried in
<hi>Middleſex,</hi> where the oath was made; for the perjury (if any were) was
in the Exchequer. But they ſaid, that the iſſue here was ill joyned, becauſe
it did ariſe upon two points triable in ſeverall Countries, which could
not joyne: whereas the Plaintiffe might have taken iſſue upon one of
them well enough, for each of them did go to the whole; and if any of
them were found for the Plaintiffe, that he had ſufficient cauſe to
recover. <hi>Gaudy</hi> moved, that it ſhould be helped by the Statute of <hi>Jeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>failes,</hi>
which ſpeakes of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning
of iſſues. <hi>Anderſon,</hi> the iſſue here
is not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned;
for if the Counties could joyne, the iſſue were good:
but becauſe that the Counties cannot joyne, it cannot be well
tried: But the iſſue it ſelfe is well enough. <hi>Windham</hi> and <hi>Rodes</hi> were
of the ſame opinion, that it was not helped by the Statute: but
<hi>Periam</hi> doubted it. <hi>Anderſon</hi> ſaid, That if an iſſue triable in one Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
be tried in another, and judgement given upon it, it is errour.

<hi>32. H.</hi> 8. Cap. 30. ſpeaks of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning
of proceſſe, and miſ-joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of iſſues; and admit that this caſe is not within any of thoſe clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
each of them being conſidered by it ſelfe; yet I conceive, it is

viz. 32. <hi>H.</hi> 8. Cap. 30. and 18. <hi>Eliz.</hi> Cap. 14. for I conceive
the meaning of both the Statutes was to ouſt delayes, circuits of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and moleſtations, and that the partie might have his judgement,
notwithſtanding any defect, if it were ſo, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
that defect ſufficient title and cauſe did appeare to
the Court. And here the Plaintiffe hath ſufficient cauſe to recover, If
any of the points of the iſſue be found for him. For if it bee found,
that the matter and ſubſtance of the oath be found true (which might
be tried well enough by thoſe in <hi>London)</hi> the Plaintiffe hath cauſe to
recover; Wherefore I conceive, that the verdict in <hi>London</hi> is good

treſpaſſe againſt him; can he excuſe himſelf, by ſaying, that he did it as
my Bailiffe or Servant? Can he ſo father his miſ-demeanours upon
another? He cannot; for once he was a treſpaſſer, and his intent
was manifeſt. But if one diſtrein as Bailiffe, although in truth, he is not
Bailiffe; if after he in whoſe right he doth it, doth aſſent to it, he
ſhall not be puniſhed as a treſpaſſour; for that aſſent ſhall have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation

135 WOOD againſt ASH and FOSTER.</head>
            <p>CErtain Lands with a Stock of Sheep was leaſed by Indenture; and
the Leſſee did covenant by the ſame Indenture, to reſtore unto
the Leſſor at the end of the Terme, ſo many Sheep in number as he
took in Leaſe, and that they ſhould be betwixt the age of two and four
years. Afterwards the Leſſee granted the ſame Stock unto a Stranger,
viz. to <hi>Elizabeth Winſor,</hi> who was the wife of <hi>Aſhe;</hi> whereas in truth,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:40982:61"/>
all the ancient Stock was ſpent. And it was holden by all the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices
upon an Evidence given unto a Jury at the Bar, That when ſuch
a Stock of Sheep is leaſed for years, the principall Property doth remain
in the Leſſor, as long as thoſe Sheep which were in <hi>eſſe</hi> at the time of
the Leaſe, ſhould live; but if any of them do die, and other come
in their roomes, then the property of thoſe new Sheep doth belong
to the Leſſee; and therefore they held, that the ſecond Leſſee ſhould
have ſo many of the Sheep as were left, and did remaine at the end
of the Leaſe, and no other. And yet it was objected by <hi>Walmeſley,</hi>
That the Stock was entire, and that as ſoon as any other came in
the room of the ancient Sheep which were dead, that they were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
part of the ſame ſtock; and although they be all dead, and
ſo changed ſucceſſively two or three times; yet (he ſaid) it ſhall be
ſaid the ſame ſtock. And he reſembled the ſame to the caſe of a
Corporation, which although all the Corporation die, and other new
men come in their places, it ſhall be ſaid the ſame Corporation. But
notwithſtanding his Opinion, all the Juſtices were of opinion as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
<hi>Walmeſley</hi> ſaid, That agreeing with his opinion was the opinion
of all the civill Lawyers: but the Court was angry, and rebuked him,
that he did in ſuch manner croſſe their opinions, and that he cited the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of Civilians in our Law; and they reſolved the contrary; and they
ſaid, there is a difference betwixt the Leaſe of other Goods; and a leaſe
of live Cattel; for in the firſt Caſe if any thing be added for mending,
repairing, or otherwiſe by the Leſſee, at the end the Leſſor ſhall have
the additions, for of them he hath alwayes the property, and they are
annexed to the principall; but Lambs, Calves, &amp;c. are ſevered from
the principall, and are the Profits ariſing of the Principall, which
the Leſſee ought to have, elſe he ſhould pay his Rent for nothing:
And as to the iſſue upon the <hi>Cepit</hi> by <hi>Foſter,</hi> it was ſhewed,
That he did but ſtay the Sheep in his Manor, where he had Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons
Goods, Waifes, and Strayes, and that the Sheep were
ſtayed upon a Huy and Cry; and that he had taken Bond of one, to
whom he had delivered the Sheep, to render them to him who had the
right of them. And that ſtay was holden by the Court to be out of
the point of the Iſſue; For that he who doth ſtay, doth not take.</p>

Intratur Paſch. 28. El. Rot. 826.</head>
            <p>SIR <hi>Roger Lewknor,</hi> ſeiſed of <hi>Wallingford</hi> Park, made a leaſe thereof
unto <hi>Ford</hi> for years, and died: the Leſſee granted over his term
to another, excepting the Wood: the term expired; and now an
action of Waſte was brought againſt the ſecond leſſee by the two
Coparceners and the Heir of the third Coparcener, her Husband being
tenant by the courteſie. And <hi>Shuttleworth</hi> and <hi>Snag</hi> Serjeants did ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue,
that the action would not lie in the form as it was brought. And
the firſt Exception which was taken by them was, becauſe the action
was generall, viz. <hi>Quod fecit Vaſtum in terris quas Sir</hi> Roger Lewk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
<hi>pater praedict'</hi> the plaintiffs, <hi>cujus haeredes ipſae ſunt, praefat' defend'
demiſit, &amp;c.</hi> and the Count was, that the Reverſion was entailed by
Parliament unto the Heirs of the body of Sir <hi>Roger Lewknor;</hi> and ſo
they conceived, that the Writ ought to have been ſpeciall, viz. <hi>cujus
haeredes de corpore ipſae ſunt.</hi> For they ſaid, that although there is not
any ſuch form in the Regiſter, yet <hi>in novo caſu novum remedium eſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponendum:</hi>
And therefore they compared this caſe to the caſe in <hi>Fitz.
Nat. Brevium 57. c.</hi> viz. If land be given to Husband and Wife, and
to the Heirs of the body of the Wife, and the Wife hath iſſue and dieth,
and the Husband committeth Waſte, the Writ in that caſe and the like,
ſhall be ſpeciall, and ſhall make ſpeciall recitall of the eſtate: And
ſo is the caſe 26. <hi>H.</hi> 8. 6. where <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe</hi> makes a leaſe, and the
leſſee commits Waſte: the action was brought by the Feoffees, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the ſpeciall matter; and it was good, although there were not
any ſuch Writ in the Regiſter, <hi>cujus haeredes de corpore:</hi> and we are
not to deviſe a new form in ſuch caſe, but it is ſufficient to ſhew the
ſpeciall matter to the Court. Alſo the words of the Writ are true;
for they are Heirs to Sir <hi>Roger Lewknor:</hi> and the count is ſufficient
purſuant and agreeing to their Writ: for they are Heirs, although
they are not ſpeciall Heirs of the body: and ſo the Court was of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
that the Writ was good, notwithſtanding that Exception. And
<hi>Anderſon</hi> and <hi>Periam</hi> Juſtices, ſaid, That the caſe is not to be compared
to the caſe in <hi>F. Nat. Br. 57. c.</hi> for there he cannot ſhew by whoſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
the Tenant holdeth, if he doth not ſhew the ſpeciall conveyance;
viz. that the land was given to the Huſband and Wife, and the Heirs
of the body of the Wife: Nor is it like unto the caſe of 26. <hi>H. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.</hi> 6.
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:40982:62"/>
for the ſame cauſe: for alwayes the demiſe of the Tenant ought to be
eſpecially ſhewed and certainly; which it cannot be in theſe two ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
but by the diſcloſing of the Title alſo to the Reverſion. Another
Exception was taken, becauſe that the Writ doth ſuppoſe <hi>quod tenue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt,</hi>
which (as they conceived) is to be meant, that <hi>tenuerunt</hi> joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
whereas in truth they were Tenants in common. <hi>Walmeſley</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary;
becauſe there is not any other form of Writ: for there is not
any Writ which doth contain two <hi>Tenuerunts.</hi> And the words of the
Writ are true, <hi>quod tenuerunt,</hi> although <hi>tenuerunt</hi> in Common. But
although they were not true, yet becauſe there is no other form of
Writ, it is good enough. As <hi>Littleton,</hi> If a leaſe be made for half a
year, and the Leſſee doth waſte, yet the Writ ſhall ſuppoſe, <hi>quod te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net
ad terminum annorum:</hi> and the count ſhall be ſpeciall, 40. <hi>Ed. 3.
41. E.</hi> 3. 18. If the Leſſee doth commit waſte, and granteth over his
term, the Writ ſhall be brought againſt the Grantor, and ſhall ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
<hi>quod tenet;</hi> and yet in truth, he doth not hold the Land. 44.
<hi>Ed.</hi> 3. and <hi>Fitz.</hi> If one make divers leaſes of divers lands, and the
Leſſee doth waſte in them all, the Leſſor ſhall have one Writ of waſte
ſuppoſing <hi>quod tenet;</hi> and the Writ ſhall not contain two <hi>Tenets:</hi> And
ſuch was alſo the opinion of the Court. The third Exception was
becauſe that the Writ was brought by the two coparceners, and the
Heir of the third coparcener, without naming of the Tenant by the
Courteſie. And thereupon <hi>Snagg</hi> cited the Caſe of 4. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. That
where a Leaſe is made for life, the Remainder for life, and the tenant
for life doth waſte, he in the Reverſion cannot have an Action of waſte
during the life of him in the Remainder. So in this caſe, the Heir of
the third coparcener cannot have waſte, becauſe the mean eſtate for
life is in the Tenant by the courteſie: And to prove that the Tenant by
the courteſie ought to joyn, he cited 3. <hi>E.</hi> 3. which he had ſeen in the
Book it ſelf at large, where the Reverſion of a tenant in Dower was
granted to the Huſband, and to the Heirs of the Husband, and the
tenant in Dower did waſte, and they did joyn in an Action of waſte, and
not good. And ſo is 17. <hi>E. 3. 37. F. N. B. 59. f.</hi> and 22. <hi>H. 6. 25. a. Walmeſley</hi>
contrary: for here in our caſe there is nothing to be recovered by the
tenant by the courteſie, for he cannot recover damages, becauſe the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inhereſin
is not to him; and the term is expired, and therefore no place
waſted is to be recovered: and therefore it is not like unto the Books
which have been cited; for in all thoſe the tenant was in poſſeſſion, and
the place waſted was to be recovered, which ought to go to both accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their eſtates in reverſion. But it is not ſo here; for in as much as
the term is expired, the land is in the tenant by the courteſie, and ſo he
hath no cauſe to complain. And ſuch alſo was the opinion of the whole
Court, viz. that becauſe the term was ended, that the Writ was good not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the ſaid Exception.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:40982:63"/>
Then concerning the principall matter in Law, which was, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Writ were well brought againſt the ſecond Leſſee, or whether
it ought to have been brought againſt the firſt Leſſee; It was argued
by <hi>Shuttleworth,</hi> that it ought to have been brought againſt the firſt
Leſſee; for when he granted over his term, excepting the trees, the
Exception was good: <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c. For when the Land upon which the trees
are growing, is leaſed out to another, the trees paſſe with the Leaſe
as well as the Land, and the property of them is in the Leſſee during
the term; and therefore when he grants his term, hee may well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the trees, as well as the firſt Leſſor might have done. And that is
proved by the Statute of <hi>Marlebridge,</hi> Cap. 23. for before that Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
the Leſſee was not puniſhable for cutting downe the trees, and that
Statute doth not alter the properties of the trees, but onely that the
Leſſee ſhall render damages if he cut them down, &amp;c. Alſo the words
of the Writ of Waſt proveth the ſame, which are, viz. <hi>in terris, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mibus
&amp;c. ſibi dimiſſis.</hi> Alſo the Leſſee might have cut them down for
reparations, &amp;c. and for fire-wood, if there were not ſufficient under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woods;
which he could not have done, if the trees had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.
And in 23. <hi>H<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 8. in <hi>Brooke,</hi> It is holden, that the excepting of
the trees, is the excepting of the Soile. And ſo is 46. <hi>E.</hi> 3. 22. Where
one made a Leaſe, excepting the woods, and afterwards the Leſſee did
cut them down, and the Leſſor brought an Action of Treſpaſſe <hi>quare
vi &amp; armis clauſum fregit, &amp;c.</hi> and it was good, notwithſtanding that
Exception was taken to it. And it is holden in 12. <hi>E.</hi> 4. 8. by <hi>Fairfax</hi>
and <hi>Littieton,</hi> That if the Leſſee cut the trees, that the Leſſor
cannot carry them away, but he is put to his Action of Waſte. <hi>Fenner</hi>
and <hi>Walmeſley</hi> Serjeants contrary: and they conceived, that the Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee
hath but a ſpeciall property in the trees, viz. for fire-boot, plough-boot,
houſe-boot, &amp;c. And if he paſſe over the Lands unto another,
that he cannot reſerve unto himſelfe that ſpeciall property in the trees,
no more then he who hath common appendant can grant the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall,

the foldage. The grand property of the trees doth remain in
the Leſſor, and it is proved by 10. <hi>H.</hi> 7. 30. and 27. <hi>H. 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 13. &amp;c.</hi> If Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
for life, and he in the reverſion, joyne in a Leaſe; and the Leſſee
doth waſt, they ſhall joyne in an Action of Waſt, and Tenant for life
ſhall recover the Free-hold, and the firſt Leſſor the damages; which
proves that the property of the trees is in him. As to that that he was
diſpuniſhable at the common law, that was the folly of the Leſſor;
and although it was ſo at the common law, yet it is otherwiſe at this
day. For when the Statute ſayes, That the Leſſor ſhall recover da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages
for the Waſt, that proves ſufficiently that the property of the
trees is in him, as the Statute of <hi>Merton</hi> Cap. 4. enacts. That if the Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor
do approve part of the Waſt, leaving ſufficient for the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:40982:63"/>
and they notwithſtanding, that bring an Aſſize, they ſhall be
barred in that Caſe; and the Lord may have an Action of Treſpaſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them if they break the Hedges by force of that Statute, as it hath
been adjudged; for the intent of the Statute was, to ſettle the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of the Land approved without interruption of the Commoners:
And ſo in this caſe. But Note, that by the Statute of <hi>Marlebridge,</hi>
the Leſſor ſhall recover damages for the houſes, &amp;c. which are waſted,
&amp;c. and yet a man cannot inferre thereupon, that therefore the Leſſee
hath no Intereſt or property in them; and ſuch intereſt hath he in
the trees, notwithſtanding the words of the Statute, (which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to this meaning, as it ſeems.) And therefore <hi>Quaere,</hi> If there be
any difference betwixt them, and what ſhall be meant by this word
[Property.] But the damages are given by the Statute in reſpect of the
property which the Leſſor is to have in reverſion, after the Leaſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined.
<hi>Anderſon</hi> Chiefe Juſtice, The Leſſor hath no greater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
in the trees, then the Commoner hath in the ſoile. <hi>Walmeſley,
2. H.</hi> 7. 14. and 10. <hi>H.</hi> 7. 2. The Leſſor may give leave to the Leſſee
to cut the trees, and the ſame ſhall be a good plea in an Action
of Waſt; and the reaſon of both the books, is, becauſe the property
of them is in the Leſſor; and to this purpoſe the difference is taken in
<hi>2. H.</hi> 7. betwixt Gravell and trees. 42. <hi>H.</hi> 3. If a <hi>Prior</hi> licence the
Leſſee to cut trees, the ſame ſhall diſcharge him in Waſt, brought by
the Succeſſour. But if the Leſſee cutteth down the trees, and then the
<hi>Prior</hi> doth releaſe unto him, the ſame ſhall not barre the Succeſſour;
and ſo is 21. <hi>H.</hi> 6. Alſo he cited <hi>Culpepers</hi> caſe, 2 <hi>Eliz.</hi> and 44. <hi>E. 3.
Statham,</hi> and 40. <hi>Aſſ.</hi> 22. to prove that the Leſſor ſhall have the
Wind-falls. If a ſtranger cutteth down trees, and the Leſſee bringeth
an Action of Treſpaſſe, he ſhall recover but according to his loſſe, <hi>viz.</hi>
for lopping and topping. As to that which was ſaid, That if the Leſſee
cut down trees, that the Leſſor cannot take them away, that is true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for
that there is a contract of the Law, that if the Leſſee doth cut them down,
that he ſhall have the trees; and the Leſſor ſhall have treble damages
for them. Alſo he ſaid, That the trees are no part of the thing demiſed,
but are as ſervants, and ſhall be for reparations. As if one hath a Piſcarie
in the land of another man, the land adjoyning is as it were a ſervant, viz.
to drie the Nets; So, if one have conduit-pipes lying in the land of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
he may dig the land for to mend the pipes, and yet he hath no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
nor Free-hold; To that which was ſaid, That by the excepting of
the trees, the land upon which they ſtood is excepted; It is true, as a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
to the trees, for their nouriſhment, but not otherwiſe; for if the
Leſſor ſelleth the trees, he afterwards ſhall not meddle with the land,
but it ſhall be wholly in the Leſſee, <hi>quia ſublata cauſa, tollitur eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ctus;</hi>
And if the Leſſee tieth a horſe upon the land, where the trees ſtood
the Leſſor may diſtraine the ſame for his rent, and avow as upon
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:40982:64"/>
land within his diſtreſs, and Fee, and holden of him; And he ſaid,
that the leſſor may grant the trees, but ſo cannot the leſſee; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he ſaid, That the property is in the leſſor, and not in the leſſee:
Alſo if the leſſor granteth them, they paſſe without Atturnment: But
contrary, if the leſſor had but a Reverſion in them: Alſo if the leſſor
cutteth them down, his Rent ſhall not be apportioned, and therefore
they are no part of the thing demiſed: For 16. <hi>H.</hi> 7. and <hi>temps E. 1.
Fitz. Waſte,</hi> in two or three places it is holden, That if the Waſte be
done <hi>Sparſim</hi> in a Cloſe or Grove, the leſſor ſhall recover the whole:
Then admit that the trees excepted are cut down <hi>ſparſim;</hi> if the Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſhall be good, how ſhall the thing waſted be recovered, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
whom? <hi>quod nota. Anderſon</hi> Chief Juſtice did conceive that
the Exception was void, and that the Action was well brought; and
he ſaid, It was a Knaviſh and Fooliſh demiſe; and if it ſhould be
good, many miſchiefs would follow, which he would not remember.
<hi>Windham</hi> Juſtice was of the ſame opinion, and he ſaid, The leſſor might
have excepted them, and ſo take from the leſſee his fire wood and
Plough bote, &amp;c. But the leſſee could not grant his eſtate excepting
the trees, becauſe he had but a ſpeciall intereſt in them, viz. for his
fire-bote, &amp;c. which ſhall go with the land. <hi>Periam</hi> Juſtice agreed,
That as to ſuch a ſpeciall property, none can have it, but ſuch a one
who hath the land; and therefore the exception of the Wood by the
leſſee was void. But as to the other things, perhaps if they were Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
trees, or other Fruit-Trees, the exception had been good. Alſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the trees are not let directly, yet they are after a ſort by a
mean, as annexed to the land; and if the Action be brought againſt
him who made the exception, he cannot plead that they were let unto
him, and therefore he doubted of the exception. <hi>Rodes</hi> Juſtice alſo ſaid,
That he doubted of the Exception<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And he ſaid, That the Book of
<hi>44<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> E.</hi> 3. is, That the leſſee ſhould have the Wind-falls, and he did not
much regard the Opinion of <hi>Statham.</hi> But <hi>Anderſon</hi> Chief Juſtice
was of opinion, that the leſſor ſhould have the Wind-falls. Note, the
Caſe was not adjudged at this time.</p>

            <p>EXceptions were taken by <hi>Fuller</hi> to an Indictment upon the Statute
of 1. <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 2. for the omitting of the Croſſing of a Child in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing
of him. The Caſe was, That a Miniſter out of his Cure, at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:40982:64"/>
the Sign of the Croſſe; for which he was indicted. The firſt Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was, That the Statute ſpeaks of Miniſters which do not uſe the
adminiſtring of the Sacrament in ſuch Cathedrall Churches, or Pariſh
Churches, as he ſhould uſe to adminiſter the ſame; that this was not
the Pariſh Church in which he ſhould uſe the ſame. <hi>Suit</hi> Juſtice was of

Statute might be greatly defrauded. The words of the Statute are far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
[Or ſhall wilfully or obſtinately, ſtanding in the ſame, uſe any

Exception upon thoſe words; For the omitting of the Croſſing
only is put, and it is not ſhewed that he uſed any other rite or
Ceremony, &amp;c. for there ought to be ſome Poſitive thing. 3. He
doth not ſhew the Place or Pariſh where he perſiſted in it, and that is
materiall and iſſuable. The fourth Exception was, Becauſe it was

Chief Juſtice, If this Evaſion ſhould be allowed, the Statute were not

142 WIDALL and Sr. JOHN ASHTON's Caſe.</head>
            <p>A Writ of Error was brought by <hi>Widall,</hi> againſt Sr. <hi>John Aſhſton,</hi>
becauſe in the other action being an action of Waſt: The Plaintiff
there did declare, that he was ſeiſed, and ſo ſeiſed <hi>demiſit pro termino
annorum, &amp;c.</hi> and did not ſhew of what eſtate he was ſeiſed; And
yet he did ſuppose that it was <hi>ad exhaeredationem ejus, &amp;c.</hi> And the ſame
by <hi>Beamount</hi> was taken for an exception: as 7. <hi>H.</hi> 6. A man pleaded a
Feoffment to two <hi>&amp; haeredibus,</hi> and doth not ſay, <hi>ſuis,</hi> it is uncertain:
And in the principal Caſe it ſhall be ſuppoſed, that he hath but an eſtate
for life, for it ſhall not be intended that he hath an eſtate of Inheritance,
without expreſſing of words to carry an Inheritance. As 7. <hi>Aſſ.</hi> If I
grant a Rent to <hi>I. S.</hi> and do not name what eſtate he ſhall have in it, he
ſhall have but an eſtate for life. But he ſaid, that the Preſidents are, that
if the word [ſeiſed] had been left out, it had been good enough;
For by the Book of Entries, a man may ſay <hi>[demiſit]</hi> without ſaying
that he was ſeiſed <hi>&amp; demiſit:</hi> But if a man will plead a thing which is not
neceſſary to be pleaded, and miſtake it, it ſhall make his Plea naught:
as in <hi>Patridges</hi> Caſe: Where a ſuite was upon the Statute of Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
It is ſufficent to ſay, <hi>contra formam Statuti.</hi> But if he will plead
ſpecially, the day and place of the Statute, and miſ-plead it, it makes all
naught. <hi>Suit</hi> Juſtice, I conceive that, that is a fault incurable. But
upon the other ſide it was argued, that in 21. <hi>H.</hi> 7. It is holden, that he
might plead <hi>quod demiſit,</hi> without that, that he was ſeiſed and <hi>demiſit,</hi> as
there in an Action of Debt. And therefore it is but ſurpluſage in the
principal Caſe. <hi>Vide 15. E.</hi> 4. A good Caſe, where ſurpluſage ſhall
not hurt, becauſe it is not traverſable: And he urged that by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of 18. <hi>El.</hi> the Declaration doth not abate for matter of form: And
he ſaid that Counts and Declarations ſhall be taken by Intendment;
and it ſhall be intended, that if bringeth Waſt, that he hath ſuch an
eſtate, that he may maintain ſuch Action. In <hi>Adams</hi> Caſe, in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries,
One ſhewed that ſuch an Abbot was ſeiſed, and that the
Land came unto the King by Diſſolution, and that the King being ſeiſed,
did grant the ſame, and did not ſhew of what eſtate the King was
ſeiſed, and yet it was holden good. See a good Caſe to this purpoſe,
<hi>18. E. 3. Formedon</hi> 58. And he ſaid that the Defendant had pleaded <hi>Nul
waſt fait,</hi> and therefore he had by his Plea affirmed the Declaration to
be good. <hi>Beamount,</hi> He ought to have ſaid, <hi>reverſione inde ſibi &amp; haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibus,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:40982:66"/>

            <p>AN Action of Treſpaſs was brought againſt <hi>John Coney,</hi> for dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging

The Defendant Pleaded as to all the Treſpas, but killing of two Coneys,
Not Guilty; And as to them he ſaid, that the place where &amp;c. the
Treſpaſs is ſuppoſed, is a Heath in which he hath common of paſture, and
that he found them eating of the Graſs, and that he killed them and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
them away, as it was Lawfull for him to do, &amp;c. <hi>Cook,</hi> The
Point is; Whether a commoner having common of paſture, may kill the
Coneys which are upon the ground; and he ſaid, hemight not. And
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:40982:66"/>
firſt he ſaid, it is to be conſidered what intereſt he who hath the Freehold,
may have in ſuch things as are <hi>ferae Naturae.</hi> Secondly, What autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
a commoner hath in the ground in which he hath common: To the
firſt, he ſaid, that although ſuch Beaſts are <hi>ferae Naturae,</hi> yet they are
reduced to ſuch propertie when they are in my ground, by reaſon of my
poſſeſſion, which I then have in them, that I may have an action of
Treſpaſs againſt him who takes them, as 42. <hi>E.</hi> 3. 24. If one have Deer
in his Park, &amp; another taketh them away, he may have an action of Treſpas
forthe taking. 12. <hi>H.</hi> 8. If a Forreſter follow a Buck, which is chaſed
out of the Park or Forreſt, although that he who hunteth him, killeth him
in his own ground, yet the Forreſter or Keeper may enter into his ground,
&amp; retake the Deer, for the propertie and poſſeſſion which he hath in it by
the purſuit. 7. <hi>H.</hi> 6. 38. It is holden, that if a wilde Beaſt go out of the
Park, then the owner of the ground hath loſt the propertie in it. <hi>Brook</hi>
thereupon collects, that he had a propertie in it whileſt it was in his
Park. 18. <hi>E.</hi> 4. 14. It is doubted whether a man can have propertie in
things which are <hi>ferae Naturae;</hi> But 10. <hi>H.</hi> 7. 6. It is holden, that an

<hi>Londons</hi> Caſe, and 22. <hi>H.</hi> 6. 59. as long as they are in his ground, they
are in his poſſeſſion, and he ſhall have an Action of Treſpaſs for the

Regiſter 102. It is <hi>Quare ducent's cuniculos ſuos precij &amp;c. cepit.</hi> But
it is ſaid, that he hath common there: What then? Yet he cannot
meddle with the Wood, Sand, Graſs, but by taking of the ſame with the
mouthes of his Cattel: If he who hath the Freehold bring an action
againſt the Commoner for entring into his Land; If he plead, Not
guilty, he cannot give in Evidence, that he hath Common there. <hi>22<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Aſſ.</hi> A
Commoner cannot put in Cattel to Agiſt: So is 12. <hi>H.</hi> 8. And of late it
was holden in this Court, That where the Commoners did preſcribe,
that the Lord had uſed to put but ſo many of his Cattel upon the Lands;
That it was a void preſcription. <hi>Godfrey,</hi> Contrary. That it is Lawfull
for the Commoner to kill them: And he agreed the Caſes which were
put by <hi>Cook</hi> And he ſaid, that the owner of the ground had not the
very propertie, but a kind of propertie in them. 3. <hi>H.</hi> 6. and <hi>F. N. B.</hi>
If the Writ of Treſpaſs be, <hi>Quare cuniculos ſuos, &amp;c.</hi> The Writ ſhall
abate; And yet he hath a propertie in them, or rather a poſſeſſion of
them. I grant, that againſt a ſtranger he might have this Action of
Treſpas, but not againſt the Commoner: for he hath a wrong done unto
him, by their being upon the Land, and therefore he may kill them,
although he may not meddle with the Land, becauſe he hath not an
Intereſt in it; and yet he may meddle with the profit of it: as 15. <hi>H.</hi> 7.
A Commoner may diſtrain damage feaſant 43. <hi>E.</hi> 3. Coneys dig the
Ground and eate the Graſs of the Commoner, &amp;c. I grant, that it is
not lawfull for the Tenant for life for to kill the Coneys of him, who
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:40982:67"/>
hath a free Warren in the ground. For if a man bring an Action of
Treſpas, <hi>Quare Warranem ſuum intravit &amp; cuniculos ſuos cepit, &amp;c.</hi>
It is no Plea, that it is his Free-hold. <hi>L. 5. E.</hi> 4. In Treſpaſs, <hi>Quare clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum
fregit &amp; cuniculos cepit.</hi> The Defendant ſaid, that the plaintiff
made a leaſe at will unto ſuch a man, of the Land; and he as his Servant
did kill the Coneys, and it was holden no Plea, and yet it is there ſaid,
that by the grant of the Land the Coneys doth not paſs; but the reaſon
(as I conceive) is, becauſe it tends to his damage, and therefore that he
may kill them. And ſo in this Caſe, 2. <hi>H.</hi> 7. and 4. <hi>E.</hi> 4. If I have
Common of paſture in Land, and the Tenant plougheth the Land, I
ſhall have my Action upon the Caſe in the Nature of a <hi>quod permittat.
9. E.</hi> 4. If one hath Land adjoyning to my Land, and levy a Nuſans, I
may enter upon his Land and abate the Nuſans. So if a man take my
goods and carrie them into his own Land, I may enter thereupon and
retake my goods. So if a Tenant of the Freehold plough the Land, and ſow
the ſame with Corn, the Commoner may put in his Cattel, and there
whit eate the Corn growing upon the Land, and may juſtifie the ſame,
becauſe the wrong firſt begins by the Tenant; So if a man do falſly impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
me, and put me in his houſe, I may break his houſe to get forth. 21. <hi>H.</hi> 6.
in Treſpaſs, All the Inhabitants of ſuch a Town do preſcribe to have

amongſt the reſt will not gather in his Corn within convenient time, If
the Townſmen put in their Cattel, and they eate the Corn, he hath no
remedie for it; And he asked what remedie the Commoner ſhould have
for the eating of the Graſs, which his Cattel is to have, if he ſhould not
kill the Coneys? He cannot take them damage feaſants, for he cannot
impound them; Nor doth a Replevin lye of them. 19. <hi>E.</hi> 3. and <hi>F. N. B.</hi>
If the Lord ſurcharge the Common, the Commoner may have an
Action againſt him: but in this Caſe, he can have no Action. <hi>Gaudy,</hi>
Chief Juſtice. He cannot kill the Coneys, becauſe he may have other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie.
<hi>Suit</hi> Juſtice, A Commoner cannot take or diſtrain the Cattel of
a Freeholder damage feaſants; And therefore he cannot kill or deſtroy
the Coneys, and he hath a remedy; for he may have an Action upon
the Caſe, or an Aſſize againſt him for putting in of the Coneys, if he
do not leave ſufficient Common, for the Commoner. Judgment was

            <head>145 YARRAM and BRADSHAWE's Caſe.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>YArram</hi> and <hi>Wilkenſon,</hi> Sheriffs of the City of <hi>Norwich,</hi> brought
an Action upon the Caſe againſt <hi>Bradſhawe,</hi> becauſe that they
being Sheriffs of <hi>N.</hi> A <hi>Capias ad ſatisfaciendum</hi> (and ſhewed at whoſe
Suit, and in what action) was awarded unto them; And they, 20. Feb.
<hi>Anno 25. El.</hi> directed their Warrant in writing to three Sergeants of the
ſame City to arreſt him; by force of which the Sergeants the 26. of Feb. in
the ſame year, did Arreſt him in Execution, and that he was reſcued and
eſcaped: And that they had ſpent divers ſumms of Money in enquiring
after him, <hi>ad grave damnum eorum, &amp;c.</hi> The Defendant pleaded, Not
Guilty; And upon Tryal of the iſſue, a ſpecial Verdict was found, that
<hi>about</hi> 20. Feb. <hi>Anno</hi> 25. ſuch a Warrant was made by them unto the
Sergeants, but not 20. Feb. and that the Sergeans by force thereof, <hi>about</hi>
26. Feb. did Arreſt him, but not the 26. of Feb. and upon the whole
matter, there was a demurrer in Law. <hi>Tanfield,</hi> for the Defendant, and
he ſaid, It was no Lawfull Arreſt. For by 8. <hi>E.</hi> 4. A Bailiff without a
Warrant in writing may take goods in Execution, and it is good, if it be by
commandment, by word onely of the Sheriff; but he cannot Arreſt the
body of a man without a Warrant in writing, <hi>&amp; ſigillo ſignatum,</hi> which
is not ſhewed here in the plaintiffs Declaration: If one in debt declare
<hi>per factum ſuum obligatorium,</hi> and doth not ſay, <hi>ſigillo ſuo ſigillatum,</hi> it is
not good. <hi>Quaere</hi> of that, for the Book of Entries is not ſo. Secondly, he
ſaid, it muſt be a preſent loſs or damage to the plaintiffs, or elſe they cannot
maintain the action: They are chargeable, but not charged; for if the
Sheriffs dye before he begin any Suit againſt them, their Executors
ſhall not be charged: But if the plaintiffs have been Arreſted, then they
are endamaged. Thirdly, as to the Verdict, the foot and foundation of
the action is the wrong; and the wrong here is not found certain; for it
is ſuppoſed to be 26. Feb. And alſo that the Warrant was <hi>Circa</hi> 26. Feb.
but not 26. Feb. and if it were any day before, then the action is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable;
but not, if it were any day after. A man brings an action, of
Treſpaſs, ſuppoſing by his writ the ſame to be done 1. May; If in truth
the Treſpaſs was before, then it is good, but if it were 2. May or at any
time after 1. May, then it is not good. It was a great Caſe betwixt <hi>Vernon</hi>
and <hi>Gray,</hi> in an <hi>Ejectione firme,</hi> The Ejectment was ſuppoſed 1. May,
and the Jury did finde the Ejectment to be <hi>Circa</hi> firſt May, and adjudged
not good. If an <hi>Ejectione firme</hi> be brought upon a leaſe made 1.
May, and the Jury finde the Ejectment to be <hi>circa</hi> 1. May, it is not good.
Alſo here they could not take him in Execution again, although
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:40982:68"/>
they had found him. For if a man be once out of Execution by <hi>14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
H.</hi> 7. He ſhall not be taken again in Execution for the ſame cauſe.
The Court held it not material whether he ſhewed or not that the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
was <hi>ſub ſigillo ſigillat',</hi> and therefore thy did not ſpeak to it. <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey,</hi>
for the plaintiff, What if they be not charged, but chargeable? yet
they ſhall have their action upon the Caſe, for the wrong done. viz.
The Reſcous and the Eſcape, becauſe the Defendant ſhall not take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of his own wrong; and ſo is the opinion of <hi>Frowick 13. H. 7. 1.
Reporter. Quaere,</hi> For <hi>Frowick</hi> ſaith, He ſhall have an action upon the
Caſe or Treſpas for breaking of priſon, againſt him, and ſhall recover
in damage as much as he loſt by the eſcape, and ſo he ſhall be helped,
and not by taking of him again: And <hi>Fitzherbert,</hi> in his <hi>Natura
Brevium,</hi> in the Writ of <hi>Ex parte talis,</hi> holds, that upon an Eſcape the
Gaoler ſhall have a ſpecial Writ upon the Caſe againſt the Priſoner to
anſwer for the Eſcape, and the damages which the Gaoler ſhall ſuſtain
thereby: and it was holden in a great Caſe, viz. One <hi>Holts</hi> Caſe:
That it is not neceſſary to ſhew that there was a recovery againſt them.
<hi>Tanfeild,</hi> but there it was after a Suit begun, although before recovery.
<hi>Godfrey,</hi> they have alſo put it in their Declaration, that they have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
great ſums of Money in looking for him; therefore they have
ſhewed that they were damnified. <hi>Tanfeild,</hi> it was fooliſh for them to
ſpend their Money, for they could not have taken him again, although
they had found him. <hi>Godfrey,</hi> A man ſhall have an action for fear of
vexation, or trouble, or charge, as one ſhall have a <hi>Warrantia Charta,</hi>
before he be impleaded. A man ſhall have a <hi>Curia Claudenda,</hi> before
any breach of the encloſure: As to the Verdict, It is certain enough,
for it ſaith, <hi>Quod tunc &amp; ibidem ſeipſum recuſſit;</hi> and that cannot but be
referred to a time certain before. viz. 26. Feb. <hi>Tanfeild,</hi> It ſhall be
referred to <hi>circa,</hi> and therefore <hi>ad tunc &amp; ibidem</hi> do remain uncertain.
<hi>Suit</hi> Juſtice, Preſently by the eſcape, there was a wrong done, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
for that he may have an action. <hi>Clenche</hi> Juſtice ſaid, That he had
experience in a Caſe of Treſpas: And it was the opinion of almoſt all
the Judges of <hi>England,</hi> That if the Treſpaſs ſhould be done
after the day wherein it is ſuppoſed to be done by the Writ; Yet
the Writ ſhall not abate, and therefore he ſaid, That the difference of
the Treſpas done before and after the day ſuppoſed by the Writ, is to no
purpoſe: Further he ſaid, that it ſtandeth them upon to have their action
before they be ſued by the party, at whoſe Suit he was in Execution: for
perhaps, he who was in Execution might dye, and other changes might
happen, ſo as they might loſe all. <hi>Tanfeild,</hi> What damages ſhall the
Sheriffs have here, if they ſhall recover before any action be brought
againſt them, when as it is uncerrain whether ever they ſhall be ſued or
not; and ſo uncertain how much they ſhall be damnified? But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
all which was ſaid by <hi>Tanfeild,</hi> Judgment was given for the
Plaintiffs.</p>

147 GREENE and HARRIS Caſe.</head>
            <p>IN an <hi>Ejectione firme</hi> upon a ſpecial Verdict, it was found, that one <hi>John
Brenne</hi> was ſeiſed of a Manor where there were Copyholders for life,
and by Indenture leaſed a copyhold called <hi>Harris</hi> Tenure, parcel of the
Land in queſtion, to <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John Blackborow,</hi> for eight years, to begin
after the death of <hi>Brenne</hi> &amp; his <hi>Wife;</hi> and by the ſame Indenture leaſed all
the Manor to them as before: The Copyholder did ſurrender, and <hi>Brenne</hi>
granted a copy to hold according to the cuſtom of the Manor. <hi>Brenne</hi>
and his <hi>Wife</hi> died: So as the leaſe of <hi>Blackborow</hi> was to begin; <hi>Peter</hi>
entred and granted all his Intereſt unto a ſtranger, and died. <hi>John</hi> entred
into the whole as Survivor, and made a leaſe thereof to the Plaintiff,
and the Copyholder entred, and he brought the action. <hi>Shuttleworth</hi>
for the plaintiff: The queſtion is, whether the plaintiff ſhall have <hi>Harris</hi>
Tenure, as in groſs, or as parcel of the Manor? and he conceived, that
becauſe it is named by it ſelf, that it ſhall paſs as in groſs; for ſo their intent
appeareth to be. In 33. <hi>H. 8. Dyer</hi> 48. A Feoffment was made of a Manor
to which a Villein was Regardant, by theſe words, viz. <hi>Dedi unam
acram, &amp;c.</hi> And further, <hi>Dedi &amp; conceſſi Villanum meum:</hi> and there it
was holden that the Villein ſhould paſs as in groſs, and that they were
ſeveral gifts, although there was but one Deed. The ſame Law ſhall
be of an Advowſon appendant. 14. and 15. <hi>El. Dyers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Husband and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:40982:69"/>
Wife were joint-tenants in Fee of a Manor out of which the Queen had a
Rent of twenty pound <hi>per annum,</hi> and ſhe by her Letters patents, in
Conſideration of Money paid by the Husband, did give, grant, releaſe,
and remiſe unto the Husband and his heirs the ſaid twenty pound Rent,
<hi>habendum &amp; percipiendum</hi> to him and his heirs; The Husband did
deviſe the Rent unto another and his heirs, and dyed: There it is debated,
whether the Wife ſhould pay the Rent or not; and it was holden
that ſhe ſhould pay it, for the deed having words of grant and releaſe,
it ſhall be referred to the Election of the Husband, and for his beſt
avail how he will take it; and there is no neceſſity that the Rent be
extinguiſhed in his poſſeſſion; for it is a maxime in Law, that every
grant ſhall be taken beneficially for the grantee: ſo is it, if it contain words
of two intents, he may take that which makes beſt for him. 21. and
<hi>22. H.</hi> 6. A deed comprehending <hi>Dedi &amp; conceſſi,</hi> was pleaded
as a Feoffment. In 5. <hi>E.</hi> 3. A Rent iſſuing out of Lands in Fee was
granted to Tenant by the courteſie, to have and to hold to him and
his heirs; It ſhall not be taken as extinct, but the Rent ſhall go to
his heires, although he himſelf could not have it; Then in our Caſe,
becauſe it is more beneficial for the Termor, he ſhall have it in groſs;
And ſo he ſhall avoid the Eſtate of the Copyholder afterwards;
and here is an Election made by <hi>Peter</hi> ſo to have it by the grant of
his Intereſt over. Our Caſe is not like unto the Caſe of 48. <hi>E.</hi> 3. 14.
Where a <hi>Ceſſavit</hi> was brought, ſuppoſing that the Houſe was holden of
the Plaintiff by five Shillings, and the Defendant pleaded, that the Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor
of the Plaintiff, by his deed, which he ſhewed forth, gave the houſe to
him and a ſhop, which are holden by one intire ſervice, and demanded
judgment, &amp;c. And there it was holden, that that deed did not prove,
but that the ſhop might be parcel of the houſe, and not a ſhop in groſs
by it ſelf. And there <hi>Finchdon</hi> ſaith, That if a man grant the Manor of <hi>F.</hi>
to which an Advowſon is appendant, and the Advowſon of the Church of
<hi>F.</hi> ſo as it is named in groſs, yet it ſhall paſs as appendant; I
yeild to that, for there it is not more beneficial for him the one
way or the other, as it is in our Caſe. It may be perhaps ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
That the Plaintiff here ſhall not recover at all for the
cauſe alleadged in <hi>Plo. Comm.</hi> 424. in <hi>Bracebridges</hi> Caſe, becauſe
that the action is brought for a certain number of Acres, as one
hundred Acres, and it is found that the Plaintiff hath right but to a
moyty of them: But it hath been ruled againſt that; viz. that he ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover.
<hi>Walmeſley</hi> Sergeant contrary. Notwithſtanding that this Copy-hold
be twice named; yet it ſhall paſs as parcel of the Manor, and
not as a thing in groſs, and there is but one Rent, one Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure,
and one reverſion of both. 45. <hi>E.</hi> 3. A Fine was levyed
of a Manor unto which an Advowſon was appendant, wherein a
third part was rendred back to one for life, with divers Remainders over,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:40982:69"/>
And ſo of the other two parts, with the advowſon of every third part,
as aboveſaid; and there it is debated who ſhall have the firſt avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.
And it is holden notwithſtanding the Diviſion as aforeſaid, and
the naming of one before the other, that they are all Tenants in
common of it: So as if they cannot agree to preſent, that Lapſe
ſhall incurre to the Biſhop; and there no Prerogative is given to him
who is firſt named, nor any prejudice to the laſt named; for being by
one Deed, it ſhall paſſe <hi>uno flatu. 14. H.</hi> 8. 10. A Leaſe was made for
a year, <hi>Et ſic de anno in annum, &amp;c.</hi> And there it was debated, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it were a ſeverall Leaſe for every year; and it was ruled, That an
Action might be brought, ſuppoſing that he held for one and twenty
years, if in truth by force of the ſame Demiſe the Leſſee occupy the
Land ſo long: And if I by my Deed grant unto <hi>A.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
of <hi>I. D.</hi> and by the ſame Deed the ſervices of <hi>I. S.</hi> are alſo gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
unto them, they are Joyn-tenants of the Services or Seignories:
So if I leaſe a Manor, reciting every parcell of the Land of the Manor,
for the whole conſiſts in ſeverall parcels; In 33. <hi>H.</hi> 8. (before remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred,)
It is ſaid, That the Advowſon ſhall be appendant, if the whole
Manor be granted, &amp;c. But if it be admitted that there be ſeverall
Leaſes, and that it paſſeth as a thing in groſſe; yet in the <hi>interim</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the life of <hi>Brenne,</hi> and his wife, it is one entire Manor. For if
<hi>Blackborow</hi> had levied a Fine thereof before entry, his Intereſt in the
Land had not paſſed. And if a Fine be levied of the Manor, and the
Conuſee render back part to one for life, and another part to another
for life, the remainder of the whole to a third; until the Two enter, it is
one entire Manor in the hands of the Conuſee. If I deviſe that my
Executors ſhall ſell ſuch Lands which are parcell of a Manor, and dye;
untill they ſell, it remains parcell of the Manor: So if the heir ſelleth
the Manor, that Land ſhall paſſe, for it is but executory, and remains
parcell untill it be executed. Wherefore in the principall Caſe here,
the Copy-hold is good. The reaſon of the Caſe 33. <hi>H. 8. Dyer</hi> 48.
is, becauſe before the grant, the advowſon was not appendant to that
acre onely, but to the whole Manor, and to that acre as parcell of it.
Alſo he ſaid, that the Copy-hold ſhall be good againſt the Leſſee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
granted before execution of his term, when as the Manor was
entire: For he who hath a Manor but for one year, may grant Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies,
and the grant ſhall be good to bind him in the Reverſion. And
if one recovereth an acre, parcell of a Manor before execution,
it is parcell of the Manor, and by grant of the Manor ſhall paſſe.
<hi>Periam</hi> Juſtice, But yet now being executed by the death of the Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor
and his wife, it is no part of the Manor if they be ſeverall Leaſes.
<hi>Walmeſley,</hi> But the Defendant is in by Cuſtome, by one who is <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
pro tempore. Anderſon</hi> Chief Juſtice, The Caſe of 48. <hi>E.</hi> 3. is like
our Caſe. And I conceive clearly here is no ſeverance; but if there had
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:40982:70"/>
been any ſeverance, it had been otherwiſe; but I doubt of the other
point. <hi>Periam</hi> Juſtice, In 13. <hi>H.</hi> 4. the difference is taken betwixt a
grant of a Manor <hi>una cum advocatione;</hi> and a grant of a Manor, <hi>et
ulterius,</hi> a grant of the Advowſon. In 14. <hi>Eliz. Dyer</hi> 311. in the
Caſe of the Lord <hi>Cromwell</hi> and <hi>Andrews,</hi> it is moved, If a man bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
and ſell, give and grant a Manor and Advowſon to one, and
afterwards levieth a Fine, or inrolleth the Deed, <hi>Dyer</hi> held, that
the Advowſon ſhall paſſe by the Bargain and Sale, as in groſs before
that the Deed be enrolled. But I conceive, that it cannot paſs if the
Deed be not enrolled, and then it ſhall paſs as appendant, by reaſon
of the intent of the parties: and ſo in this Caſe. And for the laſt
matter, I conceive, very ſtrongly, that when the Leaſe which is exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutory
takes effect, that it ſhall avoid the Copy-hold; for although
at once, <hi>viz.</hi> during the expectancy of the ſaid Leaſe, to begin at a
day to come, the Copy-hold be not extinct; yet now he may
ſay, That all times, as in reſpect to him, the Copy-hold Cuſtome was
broken. I hold, That a Tenant in Dower ſhall not avoid a Copy-hold
made during the Coverture; and ſo it hath been adjudged in the
Kings Bench. But I conceive, there is a difference betwixt that Caſe, and
the Caſe in queſtion; for in that Caſe the title of the wife to have
Dower is not conſummate till the death of the Husband. <hi>Anderſon</hi> Chief
Juſtice, I can ſhew you an Authority, That if I grant unto you ſuch
Land<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Manor of <hi>D.</hi> there the Land ſhall paſs as parcell of
the Manor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Periam,</hi> True there, for it doth enforce the firſt grant.
But here the intent of the parties doth appear, and the ſame is to be
reſpected. <hi>Anderſon,</hi> But their intent ought to be according to the
Law: as in 19. <hi>H.</hi> 8. it is holden it ſhall be in a Deviſe. <hi>Anderſon,</hi>
upon the Argument of this Caſe, ſaid, That if a Warranty be to a
whole Manor, and alſo to an Advowſon, the party cannot have
Two <hi>Warrantia Chartae. Periam,</hi> If he had further ſaid in the Deed,
That his intent was that it ſhould be ſeverall, the ſame had alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the Caſe. <hi>Anderſon,</hi> No truely; becauſe his intent did not
ſtand with the rule of Law. As if a man deviſe that his Lands ſhall
be ſold, and doth not ſay by whom, it is void, and yet the intent
is expreſſed. If the Leaſe had been by ſeverall Deeds, <hi>Periam</hi>
ſaid, The Copy-hold had beene ſevered. <hi>Windham</hi> denied that,
If both the Deeds bee delivered at one time. It was adjour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>

But if corn or graine be in the Market, although that the Contract
be made in a houſe out of the Market, and delivered to the Vendee

               <hi>Winkfeild</hi> deviſed Land in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> to one <hi>Winkfeild</hi> of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
Goldſmith,</hi> and to his heirs in Fee. And afterwards,
he made a Deed of Feoffment thereof to divers perſons unto the uſe
of himſelfe for life, without impeachment of waſte, the Remainder
unto the Deviſee in fee. But before he ſealed the Deed of Feoffment,
he asked one, if it would be any prejudice to his Will; who anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
No. And the Deviſor asked again, if it would be any prejudice,
becauſe he conceived that he ſhould not live untill Livery was made.
And it was anſwered, No. Then he ſaid, that he would ſeale it, for
his intent was, that his Will ſhould ſtand; And afterwards Livery
was executed upon part of the Land, and the Deviſor died. <hi>Rodes</hi>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:40982:71"/>
and <hi>Periam</hi> Juſtices; The Feoffment is no Countermand of the Will,
becauſe it was to one perſon: but perhaps it had been otherwiſe, if
it had been to the uſe of a ſtranger, although it were not executed.
<hi>Anderſon</hi> Chiefe Juſtice, and others, the Will is revoked in that part
where the Livery is executed. And he ſaid, It would have been a
queſtion, if he had ſaid nothing. And all the Juſtices agreed, That a
man may revoke his Will in part, and in other part not. And he may
revoke it by word; and that a Will in writing may he revoked by
word. <hi>Periam</hi> ſaid, It is no revocation by the party himſelfe, but the
Law doth revoke it; to which <hi>Windham</hi> agreed. But he ſaid, That if
the party had ſaid nothing when he ſealed the Feoffment, it had
been a revocation of the party, and not of the Law. <hi>Periam,</hi> If the
Witneſſes dye, ſo as he cannot prove the words ſpoken at the ſealing
of the Feoffment, the Feoffment will deſtroy the Will; and ſo he
ſpake to <hi>Anderſon,</hi> who did not deny it. All this was delivered by the
Juſtices upon an Evidence given to a Jury at the Barre.</p>

            <p>IN an Action of Debt upon a Bond, the Caſe was this, <hi>Norris</hi> was

<hi>A.</hi> And afterwards he delivered the goods to <hi>Salisbury</hi> the Defendant,
who gave him Bond with Condition to keep him harmleſſe from
all loſſes, charges and hinderances, concerning and touching the ſaid
wools. Afterwards <hi>A.</hi> ſerved proceſſe upon him, and he did not deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to him the goods: for which <hi>A.</hi> brought his Action upon the Caſe
againſt <hi>Norris,</hi> who pleaded, That he made no ſuch promiſe, which
was found againſt him. And afterwards, <hi>Norris</hi> brought an Action
of Debt upon the Bond againſt <hi>Salisbury,</hi> becauſe he did not ſave
him harmleſſe in that Action upon the Caſe. And the opinion of the
whole Court was, That the Action of Debt would not lie, becauſe
that the Action upon the Caſe did not concern the wools directly;
for the Action is not brought but for breach of the promiſe; And
that is a thing of which the Defendant had not notice, and it was a
ſecret thing not concerning the wools. but by circumſtances, and ſo
out of the Condition. <hi>Anderſon</hi> Chiefe Juſtice ſaid, That if <hi>A.</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe

Copy-holders, doth demand her Dower by the name of certain
Meſſuages, certain Acres of land, and certain Rents; and not by the name

ſhe hath made her demand as of a thing in groſſe. Otherwiſe, if the
demand had been of the third part of the Manor, for then ſhe had a

            <p>THE caſe was, That a Recognizance was acknowleged before Sir
<hi>N. Read,</hi> one of the Maſters of the Chancery. The Recognizee
died before the ſame was enrolled. And whether it might be enrolled at
the Petition of the Executors of the Recognizee was the queſtion? And
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:40982:76"/>
it was agreed by all the Juſtices, That the ſame might be enrolled;
for it was like unto the Conuſans of a Fine before a Judge, which
might be removed out of the hands of the Judge by a <hi>Certiorari,</hi> and
yet it is no record untill it be perfected. And at that time, it was
doubted whether the Chancery might help a man who was a purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
for valuable conſideration, where there wanteth the word [heirs]
in the Deed of purchaſe: But it was agreed by all the Juſtices, That
after a Fine is levied of Land, That the Chancery may compell the
Tenant to attorne.</p>

175 BLAGROVE and WOOD'S Caſe.</head>
            <p>IN Treſpaſs, the Queſtion was, If a Copy-hold was ſurrendred, or
not. And the cuſtome was alledged to be, That a Copy-holder
might ſurrender out of the Court to the Steward out of the Manor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
And the Steward was retained onely by word, but had no Patent.
<hi>Walmeſley,</hi> He may be Steward by word well enough. But <hi>Windham</hi>
and <hi>Anderſon</hi> held, That he might be Steward by word onely in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion,
that is, when he holds a Court in poſſeſſion; But he cannot
be Steward out of Court without a Patent, becauſe he is then out of
poſſeſſion; And therefore, it was the opinion of the whole Court,
That the ſurrender out of Court to the Steward by word, was not
good.</p>

at the Common Law; and yet the ſame all began by cuſtome. But
the Court was of opinion, That the Cuſtome is unreaſonable, becauſe
it cannot have a lawfull Commencement. And <hi>Anderſon</hi> Chiefe Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
ſaid, That a Cuſtome that an Infant at the age of ſeven years
might make a Feoffment, is no good cuſtome; becauſe he is not of

within a year and a day; and alſo becauſe the Cattel might not periſh,
which are called <hi>Animalia vagantia &amp;c.</hi> But the Defendants plea is
not good, becauſe the Defendant is to keep them until proof be made
unto him, and the Law doth not take notice of any proof, but by
twelve Men, which the Defendant cannot take, 7. <hi>H. 2. Barre<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 241.
But if the Owner can make any reaſonable proof, as if he ſhew the
Markes &amp;c. it is ſufficient, and the party <hi>ſuo periculo</hi> ought to deliver
to him the Eſtray. Secondly, It is not ſufficient to keep the Eſtray
within the Manor, but it ought to be kept in a place parcel of the Manor.
Thirdly, It ought to be in Land in the poſſeſſion of Sir <hi>John Spencer,</hi>
and not of any other; and it doth not appear that that Land was in his
poſſeſſion. Fourthly, If they do go in the Land of Sir <hi>John Spencer;</hi>
Yet it is abſurd to maintain that the Bailff might delegate his power to
another to keep them until he be ſatisfied. <hi>Walmeſley</hi> Juſtice, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;
for when it is ſpoken generally of proof, it ſhall be taken for
judicial proof, which needeth not in his Caſe, for theſe Vagrant Beaſts;
and the party ſhall not be his own Judge, but as it hath been remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
upon the Statute of Wrecke, <hi>ſi docere poterit,</hi> if he can inſtruct
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:40982:80"/>
him, and give him any reaſon wherefore the Eſtray doth appertain unto
him, he ought to deliver it <hi>ſuo periculo.</hi> Alſo it is cleer, that agreement
ought to be made with the party for the victual, and the quantity
thereof ſhall be tryed in this Court if it come in queſtion, as the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of Amends in a Replevin. <hi>Warbarton</hi> agreed, and ſaid, That an
Eſtray ought not to be wrought, but the party muſt agree for his
meate; alſo the Lord cannot put the Owner to his Oath; but if the
party doth tell the Marks, it is ſufficient, and he ought to deliver it at
his peril: and if he require more then belongs to him for the Meate,
it is at his peril, for this Court ſhall jugde of that. <hi>Daniel</hi> agreed, and
ſaid, That the Lord ought to proclaim them, and in his Proclamation
ought to ſhew of what kinde the Eſtray is, whether ſheep, Oxe, Horſe,
&amp;c. and ought to tell his name who ſeiſed them, ſo as the Owner
might know whither he might reſort for his Cattel; and then it ought
to be kept within the Lordſhip and Manor, which may extend into
ſeveral Counties. <hi>Cook</hi> ſaid, that the Owner ought not to be preſſed

the word Bankrupt be ſpoken <hi>adjectivè,</hi> becauſe they ſcandalize the
Plaintiff in his Trade. At the ſame time another Action was brought
by another Man for ſpeaking theſe words, viz. Thou art a Bankruptly

that the words were not Actionable, becauſe the words were

197 BALLET and BALLE'TS Caſe.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>AWarrantia Charta</hi> was brought by <hi>Thomas Ballet</hi> the younger,
againſt <hi>Thomas Ballet</hi> the elder; and the Writ was of two Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuages
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:40982:81"/>
and the moytie of an Acre of Land, <hi>unde Chartam habet &amp;c.</hi> and
declared, whereas himſelf and the Defendant and one <hi>Francis Ballet</hi>
were ſeiſed in the new Buildings, and of one piece of Land adjoyning
&amp;c. in the Tenure &amp;c. containing from the Eaſt to the Weſt twenty
foot by aſſize, and from the North part to the South thirty foot, and
the ſaid <hi>Thomas</hi> the elder, and <hi>Francis</hi> did releaſe unto him all their
Right in &amp;c. the ſaid <hi>Thomas</hi> the elder for him and his heirs, did War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<hi>tenementa praedict'</hi> to the ſaid <hi>Thomas</hi> the younger and his heirs: The
Defendant did demand Oyer of the deed, and thereby it appeared that
the ſaid <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Francis</hi> and one <hi>R.</hi> did releaſe to him all their
Right in, &amp;c. And that <hi>Thomas</hi> the elder for him and his heirs did
Warrant <hi>tenementa praedict'</hi> to <hi>Thomas</hi> the younger &amp; his heirs, and that
<hi>Francis</hi> by another clauſe for him and his heirs did Warrant <hi>tenementa
praedict'</hi> to <hi>Thomas</hi> the younger and his heirs: upon which it was De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murred
in Law, and after Argument by the Serjeants, ſome matters
were unanimouſly agreed by all the Juſtices. Firſt, that upon ſuch a
releaſe with Warranty, <hi>contra omnes gentes,</hi> a Writ of <hi>Warrantia
Charta</hi> lyeth. Secondly, although that every one paſſeth his part
onely, viz. a third part, yet every one of them doth Warrant the
whole: and becauſe they may ſo do, and the words are general with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
reſtraint by themſelves, the Law will not reſtrain them. The words
are, that they do Warrant <hi>tenementa praedict',</hi> which is, all the premiſſes.
Thirdly, For the reaſon aforeſaid, It needs not to be ſhewed how
they hold in jointure. Fourthly, that the Writ is well brought againſt
one onely, becauſe the Warranties are ſeveral; But if they had been joint
Warranties, then it ought to have been brought againſt them both
ſo againſt the Survivor &amp; the heir of one of them; and if they had both
dyed, againſt both their heirs; ſo as it differs from an Obligation per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
which onely binds the Survivor. Fifthly, that the Writ was well
brought for the things as they are in truth, without naming of them
according to the Deed. Sixthly, that if there be new Buildings of
which the Warranty is demanded which were not at the time of the
Warranty made, and after the Deed is ſhewed, the Defendant ſhall
not have any benefit by Demurring upon it; But if he will be aided,
he ought for to ſhew the ſpecial matter, and enter into the Warranty
for ſo much as was at the time of the making of the Deed, and not for
the reſidue: <hi>Vide Fitz. Warrantia Charta</hi> 31. Seventhly, that a
<hi>Warrantia Charta</hi> doth not lye of a piece of Land, no more then a <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipe

226 WILSON and WORMAL's Caſe.</head>
            <p>IN an Evidence given to a Jury, it was admitted without Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
that if judgment in an action of Debt be given againſt Leſſee
for years, and afterwards the Leſſee alieneth his Term, and after the
year the Plaintiff ſueth forth a <hi>Scire facias,</hi> and hath Execution; That
the Terme is not lyable to the Execution, if the Aſſignement were made
<hi>bona fide.</hi> Alſo in that <hi>Cook</hi> Chief Juſtice ſaid, that if Leſſee for years
aſſignee over his Terme by fraud to defeat the Execution:
And the Aſſignee aſſigneth the ſame over unto another <hi>bona
fide,</hi> that in the hands of the ſecond Aſſignee, it is not
lyable to Execution: Alſo in this Caſe it was ſaid for Law, That if a
Man who hath goods but of the value of 30. pound, be endebted unto
two Men, viz. to one in 20. pound, and to another in 10. pound: and
the Debtor aſſignes to him who is in his debt 10. pound, all the goods
which are worth 30. pound, to the intent that for the reſidue above the
10. pound debt, he ſhall be favourable unto him: This Aſſignement is
altogether void, becauſe it is fraudulent in part. But <hi>Foſter</hi> Juſtice ſaid,

227 BRISTOW and BRISTOWE's Caſe.</head>
            <p>IN an Action of Covenant, the Caſe was this, Leſſee for 90. years
made an Aſſignement for part of the Term, viz. for 10. years,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:40982:86"/>
and the Aſſignee covenated to repair &amp;c. The firſt Leſſee deviſed
the Reverſion of the Term, and dyed; the Deviſee of the Reverſion
brought an Action of Covenant againſt the Aſſignee for 10. years;
and the queſtion was, If the Deviſee of the Reverſion being but a
Termor, were within the Statute of 32. <hi>H.</hi> 8 of Conditions? Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
whether the Action would lye, becauſe no notice was given of
the grant of the Reverſion. <hi>Dodderidge</hi> Serjeant, to the firſt point
ſaid, that this grant of the Reverſion was not within the Statute;
for the Statute is, that the grantee ſhall have ſuch remedy as the ſaid
Leſſors or Grantors themſelves or their heirs or ſucceſſors ſhould have
had, ſo as the Statute ſhall be intended of a Reverſion in Fee; for
the Statute doth not provide, but in caſe where heirs or ſucceſſors
ſhall have Action, and not in caſe where the Action doth belong to
Executors. For the ſecond point, he relyed upon <hi>Mallories</hi> Caſe, where
it is ſaid, that the Tenant is to have notice of the Aſſignement of the
Reverſion. <hi>Cook</hi> Chief Juſtice, I hold that the Aſſignee of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
for years in this Caſe ſhall have an Action of Covenant by the
Statute: It was <hi>Leonards</hi> Caſe in the time of the Lord <hi>Dyer,</hi> when I
was a Reporter in this Court In <hi>Leonards</hi> Caſe Leſſee for years leaſed
over part of the Term upon condition (which is ſo much as a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,)
and afterwards granted the Reverſion: and it was ruled, that
the grantee might enter for the condition broken, and the reaſon (as
I remember) was, becauſe that Executors are named in the Statute;
(but I will not charge my memory with the reaſon,) but I am well
aſſured that the Caſe was ruled as I have ſaid. <hi>Dodderidge,</hi> It is ſo, that
within the Statute Executors are named, but not the Executors of
him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who hath the Reverſion, but onely the Executors of the Leſſee,
and therefore the naming of Executors in the Statute doth not make
againſt us. But the Lord <hi>Cook</hi> ſaid, What anſwer you to <hi>Leonards</hi>
Caſe? For the third point, <hi>Cook</hi> Chief Juſtice, and <hi>Foſter</hi> Juſtice held,
that there needed not any notice in this Caſe; becauſe there is not any
Penalty in the caſe, as was in <hi>Mallories</hi> caſe: For there was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
<hi>Warbarton</hi> Juſtice, I doubt the firſt point, for he who bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Action upon the Statute, ought to have the whole Reverſion:
and ſo is <hi>Winters</hi> caſe, in <hi>Dyer 309. Cook</hi> and <hi>Foſter</hi> ſaid, It needs not
that he who is to take advantage by this Statute, ſhould have the whole
Reverſion; for it hath been adjudged, That if the Reverſion be granted
in tail, that the grantee ſhall take advantage of this Statute, and ſhall
enter for the condition broken.</p>

228 CANDICT and PLOMER's Caſe.</head>
            <p>THe Pariſhoners had uſed time out of memory of man, &amp;c. to
chuſe the Pariſh Clark of the Church of St. <hi>Auſtins</hi> in <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury;</hi>
and the old Clark being dead; they choſe a new Clark, and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
by force of a new Canon choſe another man for the Clark: upon
which, the Clark choſen by the Pariſhoners was ſued in the Spiritual
Court, and he had a Prohibition: And afterwards he was ſued again
in the Spiritual Court, for ſetting of the Bread upon the Communion
Table, and for ſinging in another Tune then the Pariſhoners and the
other Clark did, and was deprived by Sentence there. <hi>Haughton</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant
moved for a Prohibition, and ſaid, that although the laſt Suit in the
Spiritual Court was not directly for the uſing of the Office of Clark,
yet by the matters contained in the Libell, it is drawn in queſtion,
whether he were lawfull Clark or not, and therefore prayed a Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition.
<hi>Cook,</hi> You ſhall have a Prohibition, for the Canon is againſt the
common Law. For particular cuſtoms are part of the common Law: and
ſaid, that the Canon Law would not endure Gun-ſhot. And he ſaid,
that by the Suit in the Spiritual Court, they would examine whether he
were a Lawfull Clark or not: For if he be a Lawfull Clark, then he hath
good authority to ſet the Bread upon the Communion Table. <hi>Haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
But what ſhall we do? for we are deprived by Sentence given
there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Cook,</hi> There is no queſtion; but that the Prohibition lyeth
notwithſtanding the Sentence there; and for the Deprivation, it is
meerly void. For the Clarkſhip is a Lay Office, and may be executed
by a Lay Man, and therefore the Ordinary hath no power to deprive
him. But he may have an Action as Clark notwithſtanding the Depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
for ſo is the Book in 8. <hi>Aſſ.</hi> 29. for an Hoſpital. And I wiſh,
that an Information be drawn againſt them for holding plea of a thing,
which is a meer Lay thing: as it was <hi>in temps. H. 8. Br. Caſes. Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſley</hi>
Juſtice, The Office is Lay, and the Deprivation by the Ordinary
is void; For he cannot deprive him becauſe he hath nothing to do in
the Election: and a Prohibition was granted. At another day, the Caſe
was moved again, and the Court was of the ſame opinion, that the
Clark could not be deprived, becauſe the Clarkſhip was a Lay Office.
And 3. <hi>E. tit. Annuity</hi> 40. was cited, and 18. <hi>F.</hi> 3. Where a Forme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
was brought of the Office of Serjeancy of the Church of <hi>L.</hi> But
<hi>Cook</hi> ſaid, the ſame day in another caſe, which was moved in Court,
and gave it for a rule, that after Sentence given in the Spiritual Court,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:40982:87"/>
he would not grant a prohibition, if there were not matter apparent
within the proceedings; For I will not allow, that the party ſhall
(to have a Prohibition) ſhew any thing not grounded on the Sentence
to have a Prohibition, becauſe he hath admitted of the Juriſdiction;
and there is no reaſon for him to try if the ſpirituall Court will help
him, and afterwards at the common Law to ſue forth a Prohibition.
All which was agreed by the whole Court.</p>

<hi>Wardall;</hi> and declared upon a Bond with Condition in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorſed
for the performance of an Arbitrement: The Defendant pleads in
barre, That the Arbitrators <hi>nullum fecerunt arbitramentum;</hi> the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffe
replied, That they did make an Arbitrement: <hi>viz.</hi> That the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant
and one of the Arbitrators ſhould enter into a Bond of eight
pound to the Plaintiffe; And that after the Bond entred into, that
the Plaintiffe and Defendant ſhould releaſe all Actions each to other,
and ſaid, That the Defendant and the Arbitrator did not enter the
Bond to the Plaintiffe; The Defendant did maintain his barre; viz.
<hi>quod nullum fecerunt arbitramentum;</hi> upon which iſſue was joyned, and
it was found for the Plaintiffe. <hi>Dodderidge</hi> for ſtay of judgement, ſaid,
That upon the Plaintiffes own ſhewing, it appeareth, That the Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trament
is void; for the Arbitrament is, that a ſtranger, viz. one of
the Arbitrators, ſhould enter Bond, and alſo that after the Bond
entred into, That the Plaintiffe ſhould releaſe all actions, whereby the
Bond ſhould be releaſed, and therefore it was void; and a void ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrament
is no arbitrament. It was admitted by the Court, that the
arbitrament was void as to the Bond, to be entred into by the Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trator,
and alſo that it was void as to the extinguiſhment of the Bond,
by the releaſe of all Actions: But the Court conceived, That the Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrament
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:40982:87"/>
did conſiſt of two matters which were diſtinct, and might
be ſevered. For although that the Arbitrament be void as to one mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
yet it ſhall ſtand good, and ſhall be a good Arbitrament for the
other matter. And <hi>Foſter</hi> Juſtice ſaid, That in that caſe, the Award to
make the Releaſe might be ſevered; viz. That it ſhould be good for
all Actions except the Bond. <hi>Cook</hi> contrary, And ſaid, That it is ſo
entire that it cannot be divided. But the Court conceived, That the
Arbitrament was good as to the Bond to be made by the Defendant,
although it were void as to the Arbitrator. At another day <hi>Dodde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridge</hi>
ſaid, That the Plaintiffe had not alledged any Breach of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrament:
for he hath put it, That the Defendant and the Arbitrator
had not entred into the Bond; and although they two joyntly had not
entred into the Bond; yet it might be that the Defendant alone had
entred into the Bond, and it needed not that the Arbitrator
enter the Bond; for as to him, the Arbitrament was void. And that
Exception was allowed as a good Exception by the whole Court. For
they ſaid, That the Plaintiffe ought for to ſhew, and alledge a breach
according to the Book of <hi>L. 5. E.</hi> 4. 108. And they ſaid, That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though

            <p>IN a Writ of Dower brought by the Lady <hi>Foliambe,</hi> It was agreed
by the whole Court. That if the Husband maketh a Leaſe for years,
rendring rent, and dieth; the wife ſhall recover her Dower, and ſhall
have preſent Execution of the Land, and thereby ſhe ſhall have the
third part of the Reverſion, and of the Rent, and execution ſhall not
ceaſe: And all the Juſtices ſaid, That the Sheriffe ſhould ſerve exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of the Land as if there were not any Leaſe for years, for it may
be that the Leaſe for years is void; And although it be ſhewed in
pleading, that there is a Leaſe for years, the wife cannot anſwer to it;
and it may be there is not any Leaſe, and therefore the Execution
ſhall be generall; And he who claimes the Leaſe for years, may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enter

accounted from the date of theſe preſents: The Queſtion is, If the
Leaſe to <hi>John</hi> ſhall be ſaid to begin preſently, or after the Term of
<hi>Thomas.</hi> And the Juſtices were cleer of opinion, That the Leaſe to
<hi>John</hi> ſhall not be accounted from the time of the date, but from the
end of the Term of <hi>Thomas,</hi> becauſe, that when by the firſt words of

taking as Bailiff of Sir <hi>Francis Barrington</hi> in ſixteen Acres of wood
in <hi>Hatfield</hi> Chaſe; and ſhewed that an Arbitrament was made by the
Lord <hi>Burghley</hi> late Lord Treaſurer, betwixt the Lord <hi>Rich</hi> and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors
of Sir <hi>Francis;</hi> by which it was awarded, That the ſaid Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors
of the ſaid Sir <hi>Francis Barrington</hi> and his Heirs ſhould have the
herbage of a certain number of Acres within the ſaid Chaſe; and alſo
that he ſhould have to him and his Heirs the Trees and Buſhes of the
ſaid number of Acres within the ſaid Chaſe; and that he might fell
and cut ſixteen Acres every year of the ſaid Acres; and that he ſhould
encloſe them according to the Laws and Statutes of the Realm; and that
Aſſurance was made by the Lord <hi>Rich</hi> accordingly; and that the ſame
was confirmed by a ſpeciall Act of Parliament, with a ſaving of the
right and intereſt of all ſtrangers; and ſaid, That Sir <hi>Francis Barring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
did incloſe and cut down ſixteen Acres, and did encloſe the ſame,
and there took the Defendants cattel Damage feaſants; upon which
the Defendant did demurr in Law. The Queſtion in the caſe was, If
by the Statute of 22. <hi>E. 4. cap.</hi> 7. or the Statute of 35. <hi>H. 8. c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>p.</hi> 17.
which give Authority to make incloſures of Woods, the Commoner
ſhall be excluded. <hi>Harris</hi> Serjeant, I conceive, That the Commoner
ſhall be excluded by the Statute of 22. <hi>E. 4. cap.</hi> 7. which gives Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to incloſe and exclude all Beaſts, and therefore the Commoner ſhal
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:40982:89"/>
be excluded: But it will be objected, that the Statute is, that the Owners
of the Ground may encloſe: But Sir <hi>Francis Barrington</hi> is not Owner,
for the Lord <hi>Rich</hi> is the Owner of the Ground; I ſay, that Sir <hi>Francis
Barrington</hi> is the Owner, for he hath the Herbage and the Trees, ſo as
he hath all the profit, and he who hath the profit ſhall be ſaid to have
the Land it ſelf: and he vouched <hi>Paramour</hi> and <hi>Yardleys Caſe in Plow.
Com.</hi> &amp; <hi>Dyer</hi> 285. and 37. <hi>H.</hi> 6. 35. and 17. <hi>E.</hi> 4. 16. Alſo the Statute is in
the disjunctive, viz. the Owner, or the Vendee: and although he
be not Owner of the ſoil; yet he is Vendee of the Trees.
Secondly, It will be objected, that the ſame is not a general Law of
which the Judges are to take notice, and therefore he ought to plead it:
I hold it to be general enough, of which you are to take knowledge al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it be not pleaded: &amp; he cited <hi>Hollands</hi> Caſe. Thirdly, It will be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
that by ſuch general Law the particular intereſt of a private man
ſhall not be deſtroyed. To that I ſay, that ſuch general Statutes will
include ſuch particular intereſts, and therefore the Caſe betwixt Sir
<hi>Foulke Grevill</hi> and <hi>Stapleton</hi> was adjudged, that where <hi>Willoughby,</hi>
Lord <hi>Brookes</hi> had Lands to him by Act of Parliament, with autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to make Leaſes for one life, and no more. By the Statute of 32.
<hi>H.</hi> 8. of Leaſes, that authority is enlarged, and he might make Leaſes
for three lives. <hi>Haughton</hi> Serjeant, Although he be Owner of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits,
he is not Owner of the ſoil, and there is a difference betwixt the
ſame and the ſoil. And the Statute ſpeaks of Trees growing in his own
ſoil. <hi>Foſter</hi> Juſtice, The Arbitrament, the Aſſurance, and the eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Act of Parliament is nothing to the purpoſe in this Caſe, and to
plead them was more then was needfull; For by the Arbitrament and
the Aſſurance, the Commoner being a third perſon, cannot be bounden
in which he was not a party; And by the ſpecial Act of Parliament
he ſhall not be bound, becauſe the Act is againſt the Lord <hi>Rich,</hi> and
his Heirs, ſo as a ſtranger ſhall not be bound by the Act: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
upon the Statute of 18. <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 2. of Patents, the Caſe was,
That the Queen made a Leaſe for years, which was void for not reciting
of a former Leaſe; and afterwards ſhe granted the Inheritance unto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.
And then came the Statute of 18. <hi>Eliz.</hi> which confirmed all
Patents againſt her, her Heirs and Succeſſors; by that Statute the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee
in Fee was not bounden, but he might avoid the Leaſe for years,
for the Statute is againſt the Queen and her ſucceſſors; and that caſe
was adjudged. But our caſe is without doubt, as to that point, for the
right and intereſt of eſtrangers is ſaved by the Act: then all reſts upon
the Statute of 22. <hi>E.</hi> 4. and I conceive that the ſame is a ſpeciall Act,
and ought to be pleaded; for it is not generally of all Woods, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of Woods in Forreſts and Chaſes. But admitting it to be a generall
Act, yet I conceive, That it was not the meaning of it to exclude a
Commoner; and that appears fully by the later words of the Statute,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:40982:89"/>
viz, Without licence of &amp;c. which excludes only the Owners of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt;
and it was not the meaning that he might incloſe without the leave
of the Commoner. One thing hath troubled me in the Statute, becauſe it
is ſaid that before that time he could not incloſe more then for 3. years;
ſo as before that ſtatute he might encloſe for 3 years, as it ſeems, without
Licence, and now by the Statute, for 7 years. Alſo for another cauſe I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
that the Defendant ſhall not take advantage of the Statute as he hath
pleaded; for he hath pleaded that he did encloſe and cut, whereas the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
ſaies, that he ſhall encloſe after the Cutting: ſo as I hold cleerely, that
he hath not purſued the authority of the Stat. for upon the St. of 35. <hi>H.</hi> 8.
w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is penned contrary to this Stat. <hi>ſcil.</hi> that the Owner of the wood ſhall
make encloſure and diviſion for the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moner, and then he is to cut, I hold
cleerly that after the felling he cannot make any encloſure. Alſo admitting
that by the Stat. the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moner ſhall be excluded, I hold that by the Stat.
of 35. <hi>H.</hi> 8. that that Stat. is repealed in that point; for the Stat. of 35. <hi>H.</hi> 8. is,
That no man ſhall fell woods wherein Commoners have Intereſt by Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
until he hath divided the fourth part: ſo that the Authority, if any
were, is reſtrained by that Stat. if he be a Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moner by Preſcription, as he is
in our Caſe. But if it had been a Common by grant, it had not been within
the Clauſe of Reſtraint. And <hi>Leges poſteriores priores contrarias abrogant,</hi>
eſpecially the Stat. being in the Negative, as it is here: For by a Negative
Statute the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon Law ſhall be reſtrained: otherwiſe, if the Stat. were in
the affirmative: &amp; for theſe reaſons I conclude, That the plaintiff ought to
have Judgment. <hi>Warburton</hi> Juſtice contrary. All the matter reſts upon the
Statute of 22. <hi>E.</hi> 4. Firſt, I hold that the ſame is a general act, although it be
particular in ſome things. So you may ſay of all ſtatutes, which are parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
in ſome one point or other. I hold alſo, That the Stat. of 22. <hi>E.</hi> 4. is not
repealed in this point by the Stat. of 35 <hi>H.</hi> 8. becauſe they were made to
ſeveral purpoſes: The one was for Forreſts and Chaſes, the other onely for
other particular Woods: And I hold, that the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moner ſhall be excluded;
for otherwiſe the Stat. ſhould be void and contrary; <hi>viz.</hi> to give power to
one to encloſe and exclude all beaſts; and yet to permit another to put in
his cattel. And by the words of the Statute, which exclude all beaſts and
cattell, the Deer ſhall not be excluded or intended, for they ſhall not be
ſaid beaſts or cattel. As in 30. <hi>E.</hi> 3. One who chaſeth a cow in a Park ſhall
be ſaid within the Statute <hi>de Malefactoribus in Parcis:</hi> And then if the
authority of encloſure be not to exclude the Deer, it ſhall be to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
the cattell of the Commoner, and other the like eſtrangers, or
otherwiſe it ſhould be to no purpoſe. As to that which hath been ſaid,
That there is not a perſon who may incloſe by the Statute; the Statute
is, that the Owner ſhall incloſe, or he to whom the Wood ſhall be
ſold: ſo that although that hee be not Owner, yet he is to have the
Trees and the profits; and the Statute doth intend, that he may incloſe
who ought to have the profit: and although the ſale be not for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:40982:90"/>
yet ſuch a perſon may be ſaid Vendee well enough; Wherefore
I conclude, that Judgment ought to be for the Defendant. <hi>Walmeſley</hi>
Juſtice, I hold, that he hath not authoritie by the Statute to encloſe:
For the Statute is, When any man fels trees in his proper ſoile: ſo that
he not being owner of the ground, he is not within the Statute: and
that was the effect of his argument. And as to the other point, he did
not ſpeak at all. <hi>Cook</hi> chief Juſtice: I hold, that the plaintiffe ought
to have judgment: all the matter doth conſiſt upon the Statute of 22.
<hi>E.</hi> 4. which is to be conſidered. And firſt is to be conſidered, what was
the common Law before that Statute; and that was, That one who
had a Wood within a Forreſt, might fell it, as it appeareth by the
Statute <hi>de Forreſta:</hi> and the Statnte of 1 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 2. by licence: and alſo
he might encloſe it for three yeers, as it appeareth by the Statute of 22.
<hi>E.</hi> 4. but the encloſure was to be <hi>cum parvo foſſato &amp; haia baſſa,</hi> as it
appeareth by the Regiſter in the Writ of <hi>Ad quod damnum:</hi> ſo as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that Statute, there was an encloſure. But the Law is cleer, That
before that Statute, by the encloſure, the Commoner ſhall not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.
Then wee are to conſider of the Statute: And firſt, Of the
perſons to whom the Statute doth extend: and that appeareth by the
preamble, to be betwixt the King and other owners of Forreſts and
Chaſes, and the owners of the Soil: ſo as a Commoner is not any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
within the meaning of the Statute. And for the body of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,
you ought to intend, that the ſentence is continued, and not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
untill the end of the Statute; and the words [Without licence,
&amp;c.] prove, That no perſons were meant to be bounden by the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,
but the Owners of the Forreſts and Chaſes, and not the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners:
Like the caſe in <hi>Dyer.</hi> And although you will expound the
words of the bodie of the Statute generally; yet they ſhall be taken
according to the intent of the preamble; and therefore the Caſe of
<hi>21. H.</hi> 7. 1. of the Prior of <hi>Caſtleacre,</hi> although it be not adjudged in
the Book, yet Judgment is entred upon the Roll; which Caſe is <hi>Paſch.
18. H. 7. Rot.</hi> 460. By which caſe it appeareth, that although that a
Statute be made which giveth Lands to the King; yet by that ſtatute the
Annuity of a ſtranger ſhall not be extinguiſhed. And the Caſe which
hath been put by Juſtice <hi>Foſter</hi> upon the Statute of 18. <hi>Eliz.</hi> was the
caſe of <hi>Boſwel,</hi> for the Parſonage of <hi>Bridgwater,</hi> That although that
one who hath a leaſe for years of the King, which was void for miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recitall,
might by the ſaid Statute hold it againſt the King; yet the
Patentee in Fee ſhall not be prejudiced by the ſaid Statute: So I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
That the Commoner is not a perſon within this Statute of 22.
<hi>E.</hi> 4 Secondly, It is to be conſidered, if a Wood, in which any one
hath Common, be within the Statute: and I hold, it is not, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſeverall Woods: For (as I have ſaid) the Wood which before the
Statute might be encloſed for three years, was onely a ſeverall Wood,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:40982:90"/>
and not ſuch a Wood in which any one had common. And the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of 22. <hi>E.</hi> 4. doth extend onely to ſuch Woods which might be
felled and encloſed for three yeers: and I conceive (contrary to my
Brother <hi>Warburton)</hi> That the Deer of the Forreſt ſhall well enough
be ſaid to be beaſts and cattell. And whereas by the common Law,
before this ſtatute, the encloſure was onely to be (as I have ſaid) <hi>cum
parvo foſſato &amp; haia baſſa,</hi> by which the Deer were not excluded: now
by this ſtatute I hold, that they may make great hedges, to exclude
aſwell the Deer as other beaſts. And I agree with Juſtice <hi>Foſter,</hi> that
if he will take advantage of the Statute, that hee ought to have pleaded,
that firſt hee felled, and afterwards encloſed; and <hi>è contrà,</hi> upon the
Statute of 35. <hi>H. 8. ſcil.</hi> that hee ought firſt to divide, and afterwards to
fell, &amp;c. And alſo I agree with him, that in that point the Statute of
<hi>35. H.</hi> 8. being contrary, doth repeal the Statute of 22. <hi>E.</hi> 4. if by that
Statute the Commoner ſhall be excluded. But I am of opinion with
my Brother <hi>Warburton</hi> cleerly, That hee is a Vendee of the Trees, and
ſo within the Statute: for it is not neeeſſary, that in the Grant there
be the word [Sell,] or that money by given, nor that it be a contract
for a time onely, and not to have cantinuance, as it is in our caſe. But
he who hath the Trees to him and his heirs, ſhall be ſaid to be a Vendee
well enough. As to the other matter which hath been moved, Whether
the Statute of 22. <hi>E.</hi> 4 be a generall law or not: I hold cleerly, that we
are to take knowledg of it although it be not pleaded, becauſe it concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
the King; for it is made for the Kings Forreſts: and of all the Acts
made between the King and his ſubjects, wee ought to take knowledg:
for ſo was <hi>Stowel's</hi> Caſe. And alſo it was adjudged, that wee ought to
take knowledg of the act concerning the Creation of the Prince, becauſe
it concerneth the King. And <hi>Cook</hi> in his argument ſaid, That if there had
not been a ſpeciall provioſin for the Commoner in the Statute of 35. <hi>H.</hi> 8.
the Commoner had not been excluded by that Statute. And afterwards
Judgment was entred for the plaintiffe.</p>

239 HEYDON and SMITH's Caſe.</head>
            <p>IN an Action of Treſpaſs the Plaintiff declared of breaking of his Cloſe,
and cutting down of a Tree, viz. an Oak. The Defendant pleaded,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:40982:91"/>
that it was his Free-hold; The plaintiff in his Replication ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that he held of the Defendant by Coppy of Court Roll a
Tenement, whereof the place in queſtion is parcell: And that the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome
of the Manor is, That all the Copy-holders within the Manor
have uſed to take wood for houſe-bote, hay-bote, <hi>&amp;c. et pro ligno com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtibili
in dicto tenemento.</hi> And ſaid, that he had alwayes preſerved the
wood and trees growing upon the ſaid Tenement; And that he had
nouriſhed and foſtered the ſaid Oake; And that ſufficient wood was
not left upon the ſaid Tenement for houſe-bote &amp;c. upon which, the
Defendant did demurre in Law. <hi>Foſter</hi> Juſtice, Judgment ought to
bee given for the plaintiff; I hold that a Copy-holder, of common
right, without any Cuſtome, ſhall have wood for Reparations and
for fire-bote, and ſo is 9. <hi>H. 4. Fitz.</hi> Waſt 59. the opinion of <hi>Hall;</hi>
And I hold that the plaintiff hath an Intereſt in the Trees, according to
<hi>Palmers Caſe. C.</hi> 5. part. And 2. <hi>H.</hi> 4. 12. is, That a Coppy-holder
may bring An Action of Treſpaſs for the Trees. And I hold, That
without a Cuſtome, the Lord cannot fell the trees growing upon the
Copy-hold no more then upon a Leaſe for years. But in this Caſe by
Implication of Cuſtome, the Lord may take the Trees, if he leave
ſufficient for Reparations, &amp;c. For the Cuſtome is, That a Copy-holder
ſhall have ſufficient for Reparations; by which is implyed, that
he ſhall not have more, and then the Reſt the Lord ſhall have. And
I am of opinion, that in this Caſe, and in caſe where the trees are
excepted upon a Leaſe, that the Lord and the Leſſor may enter and
take the Trees, although there be not any clauſe of ingreſſe, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe.
But in the principall Caſe, becauſe there are not more Trees
then are ſufficient for Reparation, the Lord cannot take them, but
Treſpaſſe lieth againſt him. <hi>Warburton</hi> Juſtice, The matter of preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
is not materiall in this caſe: for of common right a Copyholder
ought to have Trees for Reparations, and to that purpoſe, he hath
a ſpeciall propertie. But the onely queſtion in this Caſe (as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive)
is, If one who hath a ſpeciall property, may bring an Action of
Treſpaſſe againſt him who hath the generall propertie? And I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
that he may well enough. As if I lend my horſe for a week,
and within the week I take him again, Treſpaſſe lieth. <hi>Walmeſley</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
For the ſubſtance, I am of opinion for the Plaintiff, but I doubt;
For I would not that Copyholders have ſo great libertie; and he hath
preſcribed to take all trees: and to take them <hi>ad libitum,</hi> is too great
a liberty. And I hold, that a Copyholder hath no greater property
then one who ought to have Eſtovers: And in this caſe hee ought to
have ſaid, <hi>quando opus fuerit:</hi> and he ought to have ſhewed, that the
houſes were in decay for want of Reparations, for which cauſe <hi>opus
fuerat, &amp;c.</hi> And ſo for the pleading, I hold that it is not ſufficient.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cook</hi> chief Juſtice, The Plaintiff ought to have Judgment: For I
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:40982:92"/>
hold cleerly, That the Lord cannot take trees without leaving ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for Reparations, no more then he can pull down or overthrow the
houſe of the Copyholder. For of common right, without Cuſtome
or preſcription, the Trees do belong unto the Copyholder for Repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and for that purpoſe hee may take them without any Cuſtome;
and the Lord cannot take the Trees without leaving ſufficient for the
Copyholder, if there be not a ſpeciall Cuſtome ſo to do. But I hold,
that without any cuſtome the Lord may take the Trees, if he leave
ſufficient to the Copyholder for the Reparations. <hi>Mich.</hi> 25. &amp; 26. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz.

But in our Caſe he brings the Action againſt another, which
lyeth, although that the houſes were not then in decay. And for

            <p>UPon an Evidence to a Jury in this Caſe, it was Ruled by the

Lord leaſeth for years, and the Copy-holder commit a forfeiture,
that the Leſſee may enter for the forfeiture. And <hi>Cooke</hi> Cheife
Juſtice ſaid, That if there be Tenant for life, the Remainder for
life; If the Tenant for life committeth a forfeiture, he in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
for life may enter; and that the Caſe 29. Aſſ. 64. is not Law.
For the particular eſtate in poſſeſſion is determined by the forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
And if hee in the Remainder could not enter, then it ſhould
be at the will of the Leſſor whether hee ſhould ever have it. The
ſame Law is, if the Remainder be for yeers. <hi>Foſter</hi> Juſtice, The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

that it would be a Scandall to the Common Law, that they differed

            <p>IN an <hi>Ejectione firme</hi> brought upon Not guilty, pleaded by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant,
it was given in Evidence to the Jury to this effect;
viz. That one <hi>J. S.</hi> who did intend to entermarry with <hi>Alice S.</hi>
by Indenture did covenant with <hi>J. D</hi> that he would marry the
ſaid <hi>Alice,</hi> being then of the age of ſeventeen years; and that
after the marriage had betwixt them; that they would levy a Fine
of divers Lands, which ſaid Fine ſhould bee unto the uſe of
the ſaid <hi>J. D.</hi> and his Heirs; and accordingly after the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marriage
the ſaid <hi>J. S.</hi> and <hi>Alice</hi> his Wife did levy a Fine unto
the ſaid <hi>J. D.</hi> and his Heirs, without any other uſe implied or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,
but what was contained in the ſaid Indenture before
marriage; and according to the ſaid Fine, the Conuſee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:40982:95"/>
the poſſeſſion of the ſaid Lands for a long time: viz. for thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
years. <hi>Cook</hi> Chiefe Juſtice ſaid, That this continuance of poſſeſſion
was a ſtrong proofe, and could not otherwiſe be intended, but that the
Conuſee came to the poſſeſſion of the ſaid Lands by the ſaid Fine, which
was ſo levied to him, and his heirs. And he ſaid, That it was adjudged
in this Court in the Caſe betwixt <hi>Claypoole</hi> and <hi>Wheſtone,</hi> That in a
Recovery, the Covenant did not lead the uſe of the Recovery, for
that it was but an evidence that ſuch was the intent of the parties.

to be reſolved in <hi>Clogat</hi> and <hi>Blythes</hi> caſe, 30. <hi>Eliz.</hi> That when no
uſe is expreſſed or implyed by Indenture, or other agreement, that
it ſhall be to the ancient uſe, viz. to the uſe of the Conuſor. As if
Husband and wife be ſeiſed of one moytie of the Land in the right
of the wife, and the Husband of the other moytie by himſelfe; and
they joyne in a Fine generally, the Conuſee ſhall be ſeiſed to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
uſes, as it is agreed in <hi>Beckwiths</hi> caſe, <hi>C.</hi> 2. part. And ſo it was
agreed, That if the Husband doth declare the uſe, and the wife doth
not diſagree, or vary from it, that the declaration of the Husband
ſhall bind the wife. And <hi>Cook</hi> ſaid, That it is not alwayes neceſſary
that the wives name be ſet to the Indenture, which doth declare an
uſe. And further <hi>Cook</hi> ſaid, That if a Fine be levied of Lands, yet
the uſes may be declared by ſubſequent Indentures. And it was ſaid
<hi>(Obiter)</hi> in this Caſe, That if a man for valuable conſideration doth
purchaſe a Leaſe for years; and hee nameth two of his ſervants as
joynt-purchaſers with him in the Deed; and afterwards the Maſter
would ſell the Lands alone, and the ſervants do interrupt the ſale, or

do it, but by a Bill of Chancery.</p>

of another Houſe adjoyning, and a Yard, that the Defendant upon the

pleaded, that the cuſtom of <hi>London</hi> was, that every man might build
upon his old Foundation, and if there be not any agreement, might
ſtop up the Windows of his Neighbour; upon which the Plaintiff did
demurre in Law: and it was adjudged for the Plaintiff, becauſe that
the Defendant did not anſwer the Plaintiffs charge, that he had built
upon the new, and not upon the old Foundation. And it was holden
by the whole Court in this Caſe, that a man may build upon an old
Foundation by ſuch a cuſtom, and ſtop up the lights of his Neighbour,
which are adjoyning unto him, and if he make new Windows higher;

the Serjeants at the Barre, That if two men ſubmit themſelves to
the arbitrament of <hi>I. S.</hi> And the Arbitrator doth award, that one of
them ſhall pay ten pound, and that the other ſhall make a releaſe unto
him, that the ſame is a void Award, if the ſubmiſſion be not by Deed;
and hee to whom the Releaſe is to be made by the Award, may
have remedy for it, for otherwiſe the one ſhould have the ten pound,
and the other without remedy for the Releaſe. And it was reſolved,
That upon ſubmiſſion and arbitrament, that the party may have an
Action upon the Caſe for not making of the Releaſe. And <hi>Cook</hi> chief
Juſtice ſaid, That it was wiſely done by <hi>Manwood</hi> chiefe Baron, when
he made ſuch award, That a Leaſe or ſuch like Collaterall thing ſhould
be done, To make his Award, that he ſhould make the Releaſe, or
pay ſuch a ſum of money, for which the party might have a remedy.
I conceive, that the reaſon is, That no Action upon the caſe upon an
Arbitrament lieth; becauſe it is in the Nature of a Judgement. At

            <p>AN Action of Debt was brought in <hi>London</hi> againſt <hi>Occould</hi> late
Steward of <hi>Gray's-Inne:</hi> upon a generall <hi>indebitatas aſſumpſit,</hi>
without ſhewing the particulars, which plea was removed into the
Common Pleas. And it was holden by the Court, That the Action
as it was brought, would not lie, for the inconvenience which might
follow. For the Defendant ſhould be driven to be ready to give an
anſwer to the Plaintiffe to the generality. And therefore the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffe
ought to bring a ſpeciall Action for the particular things; The
like Caſe was in the <hi>Marſhalſey;</hi> and becauſe they did not declare in a
ſpeciall manner, Exception was taken to it, and adjudged, the Action
upon a generall <hi>Indebitatas aſſumpſit</hi> did not lie. <hi>Quaere.</hi>

            <p>IN a Replevin, <hi>Trinit. 10. Jacobi, R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t.</hi> 2504. The Plaintiff counted,
that the Defendant, <hi>Cepit avena</hi> of the Plaintiff <hi>apud Occould:</hi> and
doth not ſay, <hi>In quodam loco, &amp;c.</hi> upon which the Defendant did demurre
in Law. <hi>Hutton</hi> Serjeant argued for the Plaintiffe, and ſaid, That not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the many preſidents which had been ſhewed, that yet the
Declaration was well enough: For he ſaid, That the preſidents did not
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:40982:98"/>
prove, that it was neceſſary that it ſhould be therein ſhewed, <hi>in quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
loco vocat',</hi> becauſe the Defendant upon the matter is the Actor;
and therefore he beſt knows the place where he took the Cattel. And
in 9. <hi>E. 4. In a Homine replegiando,</hi> the Towne onely was named;
and it is not there debated whether the ſame were good without
mentioning <hi>in quodam loco. 49. E.</hi> 3. 14. and 24. 9. <hi>H.</hi> 6. and 3. <hi>H.</hi> 6.
There the traverſe was of the taking at <hi>Dale, ſans ceo, &amp;c.</hi> that the
ſame was at Sale, and <hi>in quodam loco</hi> is not expreſſed, <hi>Cook</hi>
Chief Juſtice ſaid, That there is no book which taketh this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception:
and ſaid, That notwithſtanding the Preſidents cited, that
it was well enough: For hee ſaid, There is a difference betwixt
Preſidents, which are the Inventions of Clarks, and of judiciall
Preſidents: And the effect of the Suit in this caſe, is not the ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the place, but the having of the Cattel; and it is on the part
of the Defendant to ſhew where hee took the Cattel, for perhaps
the Plaintiffe doth not know where he took them: and if he did
know the place where they were taken, yet perhaps hee hath not
witneſſes to prove the ſame; and ſo by this means the Plaintiffe
ſhould be at a great miſchiefe, and delayed in his Suit. Whereas
a Replevin is <hi>feſtinum remedium,</hi> to have his Cattel again, which
perhaps are his plough Cattel. <hi>Warburton</hi> Juſtice ſaid, That there is
a difference betwixt Actions brought in the King's Bench, and
in this Court: For there in an Action of Treſpaſſe the ſame
may be abutted, becauſe it is no Originall Writ as it is here, and
hee ſaid, That there although the place bee not certainly abut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
yet it may be good. And he compared the Caſe at barre, to
the pleading of a Joynt-tenancy; for he ſaid, In caſe it bee plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of the part of the Tenant himſelfe, hee is to ſhew how the
Joynt-tenancy came, becauſe it lyeth in his knowledge; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
if it were on the Plaintiffs part. And in this Caſe, he who
beſt knowes when the taking was, ought to ſhew it, and that is the
Avowant; for it is no reaſon that the Plaintiffe for miſſing of the
place, not being the ſubſtance, ſhould be triced. <hi>Cook,</hi> If one in the
night drive my Cattel into his Land, and afterwards doth diſtrein
them, it is no lawfull diſtreſſe. At another day, <hi>Cook</hi> ſaid, That
in the Book <hi>Nov. Narration',</hi> it is ſaid, That the Town, place, and
collour of the beaſts ought to bee ſhewed by the Plaintiffe in the
Replevin; and he ſaid, If the Colour had been left out, he would
have given credit to the Book; but becauſe it is clear that the
Colour is not needfull to be ſhewed, therefore he did not approve
of the Authority for the place. And he cited 4. <hi>E.</hi> 3. 13. where the
Defendant ſaid, it was in the Hamlet. And 18. <hi>E. 3. 10. E.</hi> 3. and 49 <hi>E. 3.
14.</hi> where the Towns only are mentioned. And it was ſaid, That in an
<hi>Ejectione firme</hi> brought in the Kings's Bench, the uſuall courſe is to abutt
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:40982:99"/>
the Land, yet he ſaid, It might be omitted in Treſpaſſe, although
the ſame be the uſuall forme of that Court; and it may be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall:
but if a place be alledged, then the ſame is materiall,
and the Plaintiffe doth thereby give an advantage unto his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary.</p>
            <p>At another day <hi>Haughton</hi> Serjeant argued for the Defendant,
That the expreſſing of the place where the taking was, is materiall
in the Declaration; and he ſaid, That as the Regiſter is the rule
for Originall Writs, from which forme a man may not vary; ſo,
he ſaid, The Book of Entries and Preſidents of the Courts, were
rules for pleadings, from which there ought to be no variance; and
therefore he cited 33. <hi>H.</hi> 6. 14. Where in a Writ of Entry, in the
nature of an Aſſize, the Demandant counted, How that <hi>A.</hi> gave
Lands unto <hi>J. S.</hi> his Coſen, whoſe Heir he is in tail, and ſhewed
the deſcent. And Exception was taken unto the Count, becauſe it
was not the forme of the Pleading in that Court; wherefore it was
awarded, That he ſhould count, that <hi>ipſe fuit ſeiſitus ut de libero
tenemento,</hi> which is not repugnant, although that he had an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
in tail, becauſe the ſame was the Ancient form uſed in the Court.
So he ſaid in the principall Caſe, the ancient uſed forme of the
Court ought to bee obſerved, which was to expreſſe in the Count
the place in which the taking was; and hee cited 35. <hi>H.</hi> 6. 40.
Where Exception was taken by the Defendant, becauſe the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff
in the <hi>Replevin</hi> did not alledge the place where the taking was; and
therefore <hi>per curiam</hi> the Plaintiffe took nothing by his Writ: and
he denyed the opinion of 9. <hi>E.</hi> 4. 41. and ſaid, That in reaſon the
place ought to be ſhewed, becauſe if the Defendant would plead
any matter to the Juriſdiction of the Court, the place muſt be
ſhewed; and he ſaid, That thoſe Records which were ſhewed on
the other ſide were but of later times; and the Point in queſtion,
in none of thoſe Caſes came in debate judicially; wherefore he
concluded for the Defendant. <hi>Hutton</hi> Serjeant argued again, and
ſaid, That the Formes of Originall Writs are certain, from which
a man is not to vary; but he ſaid, That Counts and Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are to be according to the matter. And in the principall
Caſe he conceived, That it was not neceſſary that the place where
the taking was, be ſhewed; and hee cited 4. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 13. in a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plevin,
the Plaintiff declared of the taking of his Cattel in Holme,
without ſaying, <hi>In quodam loco vocat', &amp;c.</hi> and it was holden good,
becauſe the Towne or Hamlet is ſufficient certain; and 21. <hi>H. 7.
22. a.</hi> in a Replevin, the Plaintiffe declared of a taking at <hi>D.</hi> the
Defendant ſaid, That he took them at <hi>S.</hi> and not at <hi>D.</hi> and avowed,
and no Exception was taken thereunto for want of expreſſing the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:40982:99"/>
place in <hi>quo, &amp;c.</hi> And he ſaid, That in 9. <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 41. and 25. it is
ſaid, That in a Replevin the uſe is to declare in a certain place;
but if the place be omitted, yet it is good enough; and that
Book is after 33. H. 6. 40. and hee ſaid, That the cauſe of the
Judgement in 33. H. 6. might be, becauſe there were Blanks left for
the place; and the Plaintiff had begun to alledge the certain place;
for the Record is, <hi>In quodam loco vocat',</hi> without expreſsing the place,
but Blank, which he could not affirme; and therefore it was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
againſt the Plaintiffe; as in a <hi>Valore Maritagii;</hi> if the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant
will ſhew that hee tendered a mariage, whereas it is not
needfull for him ſo to do, yet if the ſame be not true, and iſſue
be taken upon it, Judgement ſhall be given againſt him; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hee concluded for the Plaintiffe. The principall Caſe was

270 GOODMAN and GORE's Caſe.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>GOodman</hi> brought an Aſſize againſt <hi>Gore</hi> and others, for erecting of
two houſes at the Weſt end of bis Wind-Mill <hi>per quod ventus impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,
&amp;c.</hi> And it was given in Evidence, That the ſaid houſes were ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate
about eighty feet from the ſaid Mill; and that in height it did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
above the top of the Mill, and in length it was twelve yards from
the Mill; and notwithſtanding this neerneſſe, the Court directed the
Jury to find for the Defendant. And in that Evidence it appeared by a
Deed, procured by the Plaintiff himſelf, That his Wife was Joint-tenant
with him; and therefore it was holden by the Court, That the Aſſize
brought in his own name alone, was not well brought. And <hi>Cook</hi> Chief
Juſtice alſo ſaid, That the Count was not good, by reaſon of theſe
words, viz. <hi>Per quod ventus impeditur;</hi> for he ſaid, That theſe were
the words of an Action upon the Caſe, and not of an Aſſize. But the
Clarks ſaid, That ſuch was the uſuall forme, <hi>ad quod non fuit reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum:</hi>

            <p>IN an Action of Treſpaſs, <hi>Quare clauſum fregit,</hi> the Defendant did ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie,
That he did enter and diſtrain for an Amercement in the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs

upon the Kings High-way, without ſhewing that the ſame was preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
before the Juſtices of Peace at their Seſſions, as the Statute of 1. <hi>E. 4.
cap.</hi> 2. requireth. <hi>Haughton</hi> Serjeant for ſtay of Judgement in this Caſe,
ſaid, That the Statute is, That the Juſtices of Peace ſhall award Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
againſt the perſon who is ſo indicted before the Sheriffe, which was
not done in this Caſe. And he ſaid, That the Statute did not extend to
Amercements only in Treſpaſſes, <hi>Quare vi &amp; armis,</hi> but to every other
Treſpaſs; for the Statute ſpeaks of Treſpaſſes, and other things, which
ſhall be extended to all Treſpaſſes. <hi>Cook</hi> Chief Juſtice ſaid, That the
Statute of 1. <hi>E. 4. cap.</hi> 2. did not extend to Treſpaſſes which were not
<hi>contra pacem</hi> (as the encroachment in this Caſe is) for otherwiſe the
Lord of a Leet could not diſtrain for an amercement without ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentmennt

of Felony, Treſpaſs, &amp;c. the ſame is to be meant of other things of
the ſame nature; which is proved by the clauſe in the Statute, viz.
That they ſhall be impriſoned; which cannot be in the principall Caſe

272 FRAUNCES and POWELL's Caſe.</head>
            <p>IT was moved for a Prohibition to the Spirituall Court, for citing
the Plaintiffe out of his Dioceſs upon the Statute of 23. <hi>H.</hi> 8. and
by the Libel it appeared, That <hi>Powell</hi> the Defendant had complained
againſt the Plaintiffe in the Court of Arches, for ſcandalous words ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in the Pariſh of Saint <hi>Sepulchers, London. Cook</hi> Chief Juſtice held,
That a Prohibition would lie, unleſſe the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> had given li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> to entermeddle with matters
within <hi>London;</hi> for, he ſaid, that in the Statute of 23. <hi>H.</hi> 8. there is a
clauſe of exception in caſe where ſuch liberty is given by the inferior
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:40982:100"/>
Dioceſan; and therefore a day was given by the Court to procure a
certificate of the opinion of the Civilians, whether ſuch authority
given by the Inferiour Ordinary to the Arch-Biſhop, were Warranted
by there Law or not; for the Statute of 23. <hi>H.</hi> 8. is ſo; and then if
the authority be lawfully granted, no prohibition will lye. And <hi>Cook</hi>
ſaid; that the Statute of 23. <hi>H.</hi> 8. was made but in affirmance of the
common Law, as appears by the books of 8. <hi>H.</hi> 6. and 2. <hi>H.</hi> 4. For
there it is ſaid, that if one be excomenge in a forrain Dioces, that the
ſame is void, <hi>&amp; coram non judice;</hi> and he ſaid, that the principal cauſe
of making of the ſaid Statute, was to maintain the Juriſdiction of
Inferiour Dioceſſes. But it was holden, that if the Plaintiff had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famed
the Defendant within the Peculiar of the Arch-Biſhop, that in
ſuch caſe he might be puniſhed there, although that he did inhabit

            <p>SIR <hi>John Tirrel</hi> Tenant <hi>in Capite,</hi> made a Leaſe unto <hi>Carrel</hi> for
1000. years; and further covenanted with <hi>Carrel</hi> and his Heirs,
that upon payment of five Shillings, that he and his heirs would ſtand
ſeiſed of the ſame Lands unto the uſe of <hi>Carrel,</hi> and his Heirs: And
in the Deed there were all the ordinary clauſes of a conveyance <hi>bona
fide;</hi> viz. That the Leſſee ſhould enjoy the Lands diſcharged of all
Incumbrances, and that he would make further aſſurance, &amp;c. <hi>Carrel</hi>
aſſigned this Leaſe to <hi>Cotton,</hi> who died in poſſeſſion, his Heir within
age; and in two Offices, the Jury would not find a Tenure, becauſe
it was but a Leaſe for years. And in a <hi>que plura,</hi> the matter came in
queſtion in the Court of Wards: And <hi>Cook</hi> Chief Juſtice of the
Common Pleas, and <hi>Tanfeild</hi> Chief Baron of the Exchequer, were
called for Aſſiſtants to the Court of Wards, and they were of opinion,
that becauſe it was found by the Offices, that <hi>Cotton</hi> died in poſſeſſion,
that the ſame was ſufficient to entitle the King to Wardſhip of the
Lands. But before the Judges delivered there opinions, the Leſſee was
compelled to prove the Sealing of the Leaſe by witneſſes, which was
dated 12. years before: For if they have no ſufficient witneſſes to prove
the Sealing of the Leaſe, without all doubt, there was ſufficient matter
found to entitle the King, viz. that the party died in poſſeſſion; which
ſhall be intended of an eſtate in Fee ſimple, till the contrarie be
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:40982:101"/>
proved; But the two Juſtices moved the Attorney, That he would not
trouble himſelf with the proof of a matter in fact: For they ſaid, It
was confeſſed on all ſides, that there was ſuch a Leaſe, and that the
Aſsignee of it died in poſſeſsion of the Land: and therefore they ſaid,
that they were cleer of opinion, that the Heir of ſuch a Leſſee who
died in poſſeſsion ſhould be in Ward: For <hi>Cook</hi> Chief Juſtice ſaid,
that all Offices which are found to deceive the Crown of ſuch an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
flower of the Crown as Wardſhip, ſhould be void, as to that
purpoſe, and moſt beneficial for the King. And he cited the Caſe in
<hi>36. H.</hi> 8. Where the Kings Tenant made a Feoffment, and took
back an eſtate unto himſelf for life, the Remainder to his Grand-child
for 80. years, and died; that in that Caſe the Heir was in Ward: and
they ſaid, that in the caſe at Barre the Heir had power of the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
upon payment of five Shillings; and if the Leaſe for years be
found, and proved by witneſſes, yet it carrieth with it the badges of
fraud. And <hi>Tanfeild</hi> Chief Baron ſaid, that if a Leaſe for 100.
years ſhall be accounted Mortmain, <hi>à fortiori</hi> this Leaſe for 1000.
years, ſhall be taken to be made by fraud and colluſion: And <hi>Cook</hi>
ſaid, that the Lord Chancellour of <hi>England</hi> would not relieve ſuch
a Leſſee in Court of Equity, becauſe the begining and ground of it is
apparant fraud. Note, the lands did lye in <hi>Springfield</hi> in <hi>Eſſex.</hi>

&amp;c. and ſaid, that the Obligee made his Will, and made Executors there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,

<hi>Sherley</hi> Serjeant moved, that the Executors ſhould have the ten pound,

the whole Court was of opinion, that the Executors were not named

281 PARROT and KEBLE's Caſe.</head>
            <p>A Man levied a Fine unto the uſe of himſelf for life, the remainder
in tail, &amp;c. with power reſerved to the Conuſor to make Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
for eighty years in Poſſeſsion or Reverſion, if <hi>A. B.</hi> and <hi>C.</hi> did ſo
long live, reſerving the ancient rent; afterwards he granted the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
for eighty years, reſerving the ancient rent: The queſtion
was, Whether he had purſued his Authority, becauſe by the meaning
of the Proviſo a Power was, That the Conuſor ſhould have the rent
preſently, or when the Term did begin. But the opinion of the Court
was, That he had done leſſe then by the Proviſo he might have done,
for this Grant of the Reverſion doth expire with the particular eſtates
for life. But if he had made a Leaſe to begin after the death of the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
for life, the ſame had been more then this grant of the Reverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And <hi>Cook</hi> chief Juſtice ſaid, That the Grantor may preſently have
an Action of debt againſt the Grantee of the Reverſion for the rent.
But becauſe it was not averred that any of the <hi>Ceſtuy que viei</hi> were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live

the ſaid Penſion upon Temporall grounds; viz. preſcription

were of opinion, That in this Caſe no Prohibition ſhould be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
for they ſaid, That the party had Election to ſue for the ſame
in the Spirituall Court, or at the common Law, becauſe both the
parties were Spirituall perſons; but if the Parſon had been made

284 Sir BAPTIST HIX, and FLEET<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WOOD

            <p>
               <hi>FLeetwood</hi> and <hi>Gots</hi> by Deed indented, did bargain and ſell <hi>Weſton</hi>
Park, being three hundred Acres of Lands, unto Sir <hi>Baptiſt Hix,</hi>
at Eleven Pound for every Acre, which did amount in the whole to
Two thouſand five hundred and thirty Pounds: and in the beginning
of the Indenture of Bargain and Sale, it was agreed betwixt the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
That the ſaid Park, being much of it Wood-land, ſhould be
meaſured by a Pole of eighteen foot and a halfe. And further it was
covenanted, That <hi>Fleetwood</hi> and <hi>Gots</hi> ſhould appoint one Meaſurer,
and Sir <hi>Baptiſt Hixe</hi> another, who ſhould meaſure the ſaid Park;
and if upon the meaſuring it did exceed the number of Acres men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in the Indenture of Sale; that then S. <hi>Baptiſt Hixe</hi> ſhould pay
to them acording to the proportion of 11<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. for every Acre; and if it
wanted of the Acres in the deed, that then <hi>Fleet'</hi> and <hi>Gots</hi> ſhould pay
back to S. <hi>Baptiſt</hi> the ſurpluſage of the mony according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of 11. l. for every Acre. And upon this Indenture Sir <hi>Baptiſt
Hixe</hi> brought an Action of Covenant againſt <hi>Fleetwood</hi> and <hi>Gots,</hi> and
aſſigned a Breach, that upon the meaſuring of it, it wanted of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres
mentioned in the Deed 70 Acres: And upon the Declaration, the
Defendants did demurre in Law; and the cauſe of the Demurrer was,
becauſe the Plaintiff did not ſhew by what meaſure it was meaſured.
And therefore <hi>Sherley</hi> Serjeant, who was of Councel with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants,
ſaid, that although it was agreed in the beginning of the
Deed, that the meaſure ſhould be made by a Pole of 18 feet and a half:
Yet when they come to the covenants, there it is not ſpoken of any
meaſure at all; and therefore (he ſaid) it ſhall be taken to be ſuch
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:40982:104"/>
a meaſure which the Statute concerning the meaſuring of Lands
ſpeaks of, viz. a meaſure of ſixteen foot and a half to the Pole;
and he ſaid, that by ſuch meaſure there did not want any of the ſaid
three hundred Acres mentioned in the Deed. <hi>Dodderidge</hi> Serjeant
contrary for the Plaintiff, and he layed this for a ground: That
if a certainty doth once appeare in a Deed, &amp; afterwards in the ſame
Deed it is ſpoken indefinitely, the ſame ſhall be referred to the firſt
certainty, and to that purpoſe he vouched the caſe in <hi>Dyer:</hi> Lands
were given by a Deed to a man, <hi>&amp; haeredibus maſculis;</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
in the ſame Indenture it appeared, that it was <hi>haeredibus maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culis
de Corpore,</hi> and therefore it was holden but an eſtate in tail,
becauſe the firſt words were indefinite, and the later words were
certain, by which his intent did appeare to paſs but an eſtate in tail.
He alſo cited 4. <hi>E. 4. 29. B.</hi> The words of an Obligation were
<hi>Noverint univerſi per praeſentes, me I. S. teneri, &amp;c. W. B.</hi> in ten
pound <hi>ſolvendum eidem I.</hi> And it was holden by the whole Court,
that the ſame did not make the Bond to be void, becauſe it appeared
by the promiſes of the Bond, to whom the mony was in Law to be
paid, and the intent ſo appearing, the Plaintiff might declare of a
<hi>ſolvendum</hi> to himſelf; and the word (I) ſhould be ſurpluſage.

            <p>SIR <hi>Henry Lea</hi> was committed to the Fleet, for the diſobeying

                  </gap>as Corpus,</hi> which was granted; and upon the return of the
Writ, the cauſe of his Commitment appeared to be for a contempt
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:40982:104"/>
for not performing of the ſaid Decree, and no other cauſe appeared
in the return: and the Court were of opinion, that they could not
deliver him, becauſe that no cauſe appeared in the return to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
their delivery of him: And the Court ſaid, that if the
return be falſe, yet they cannot deliver the party; But the party
may have his Action of falſe Impriſonment, if the Impriſonment be
not Lawfull: But then it was ſhewed by <hi>Mountague</hi> Serjeant to the
Court, that the Decree was made in the Court of Requeſts upon a
Bill containing this matter, viz. That <hi>Henry Lea</hi> pretending Title
unto Lands which Sir <hi>Henry Lea</hi> held by deſcent from his Unkle
Sir <hi>Henry Lea;</hi> ſhewed his Title to the Kings Majeſtie, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the King upon the Petition of <hi>Henry Lea,</hi> ſends for Sir <hi>Henry
Lea,</hi> and had ſpeech with him, that he would give unto the ſaid
<hi>Henry Lea</hi> ſome recompence for his Title which he pretended to
have to the ſaid Lands: And that thereupon the ſaid Sir <hi>Henry
Lea,</hi> at the inſtance of the Kings Majeſtie, did promiſe the King,
that if the ſaid <hi>Henry Lea</hi> would not moleſt him for any of the ſaid
Lands, which he had by deſcent from his ſaid Unkle; that then he
the ſaid Sir <hi>Henry Lea</hi> would give unto the ſaid <hi>Henry Lea</hi> two
hundred pound <hi>per Annum:</hi> And for not performance of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
made to the King, <hi>Henry Lea</hi> Exhibited his Bill in the
Court of Requeſts, upon which the ſaid Decree was grounded:
The ſaid Sir <hi>Henry Lea</hi> anſwered, that he did not know of any ſuch
promiſe he made to the Kings Majeſtie; and pleaded to the Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
of the Court: But upon a Certificate made by the Kings
Majeſtie, that he made ſuch a promiſe unto him, the Court of Requeſts
made the ſaid Decree, which Certificate was mentioned in the body
of the ſaid Decree: And <hi>Mountegue</hi> prayed, that becauſe it appeared
that the ſaid <hi>Henry Lea</hi> had remedy by way of Action upon the
caſe at the common Law, upon the ſaid promiſe, That this Court
would grant a Prohibition in this caſe unto the Court of Requeſts,
and deliver the party from his Impriſonment. But the Court ſaid,
that they would adviſe of the Caſe, becauſe they never had heard of
the like caſe. But <hi>Cook</hi> Chief Juſtice adviſed Sir <hi>Henry Lea</hi> to agree
the matter betwixt Him, and his Kinſman <hi>Henry Lea;</hi> For he ſaid,

               <hi>GArven</hi> libelled againſt <hi>Pym</hi> for a Seat in the Church before the
Biſhop of <hi>Exeter,</hi> in the ſpiritual Court there; which by Appeal
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:40982:105"/>

in the Court of Common Pleas, That he and his Anceſtors have
uſed time out of mind, &amp;c. to have an Iſle with a ſeat in the ſaid
Church, for himſelf and his family; and thereupon prayed a Prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
But becauſe it did appear upon Examination of the party himſelf,
That the Pariſh have alwayes uſed to repair the ſaid Iſle and ſeat,
the Court would not grant a Prohibition in this caſe, for that proves
that his Anceſtors were not the Founders of the ſaid Iſle and Seat;
Alſo another man hath alwayes uſed to ſit with him in the ſame ſeat,
which alſo proves that it doth not belong to him alone. <hi>Cook</hi> chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
ſaid, That if a Gentleman with the aſſent of the Ordinary, hath
built an Iſle <hi>juxta Eccleſiam,</hi> for to ſet convenient Seats for him and
his family, and hath alwayes repaired the ſame at his own coſts and
charges; In ſuch caſe, if the Ordinary place another man with the
Founder, without his conſent, in the ſame Seat, that he may have his
Action upon the Caſe againſt the Ordinary: And if he be implea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in the ſpirituall Court for ſuch Seat, that a Prohibition will lie:
And he ſaid, That the <hi>Heydons</hi> in <hi>Norfolk</hi> have built ſuch an Iſle
next to the Church, and placed convenient Seats there for them, and
their family. But he ſaid, That if a man with the aſſent of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
ſet up a Seat in <hi>navi Eccleſiae</hi> for himſelfe, and another man
doth pull up the ſame, or defaceth it, <hi>Treſpas vi &amp; armis</hi> will not

no remedy for the ſame, but to ſue the party in the Eccleſiaſtical
Court. And 9. <hi>E.</hi> 4. 14. the <hi>Dame Wiches</hi> Caſe was vouched, where

That the Ordinary hath the onely diſpoſing of Seats in the Body of

And if the Ordinary long time paſt hath granted to a man and his
heirs ſuch Seat, and he and his heirs have uſed to repair the ſaid
Seat: If another will libell againſt him in the Spirituall Court for
the ſame Seat, he ſhall have a Prohibition. And he ſaid, That he

Stone upon the Teſtator in the Church, or ſet up his Coat-armour

Prohibition was awarded to the Archbiſhop, and to the ſaid Court at

granted the Prohibition. 1. He ſaid, becauſe the matter was meerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminable

according to the courſe of the common Law. 2. Although the King
hath granted to the Lord Preſident, and the Councel of <hi>York</hi> to hold pleas
of all perſonall Actions; yet (he ſaid) they cannot alter the form of the
proceedings. For as 6. <hi>H.</hi> 7. 5. is, The King by his Grant cannot make
that inquirable in a Leet, which was not inquirable there by the Law;
nor a Leet to be of other nature then it was at the common Law.
And in 11. <hi>H.</hi> 4. it is holden, That the Pope, nor any other perſon can
change the common Law, without a Parliament. And <hi>Cook</hi> vouched
a Record in 8. <hi>H.</hi> 4. That the King granted to both the Univerſities,
that they ſhould hold plea of all Cauſes ariſing within the Univerſities,
according to the courſe of the Civil Law; and all the Judges of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
were then of opinion, That that grant was not good, becauſe the

caſe agrees 37. <hi>H. 6. 26. 2. E.</hi> 4. 16. and 7. <hi>H.</hi> 7. But at this day, by a
ſpeciall Act of Parliament, made 13. <hi>Eliz.</hi> not printed. The Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities
have now power to proceed and judge according to the Civil Law.
3. He ſaid, That the Oath of Judges, is, viz. You ſhall do and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the profit of the King, and his Crown, in all things wherein you
may reaſonably effect and do the ſame. And he ſaid, That upon every
Judgement upon debt of forty pound, the King was to have ten ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
paid to the Hamper, and if the debt were more, then more. But
he ſaid, by this manner of proceeding by <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bill, the King ſhould

            <p>IN an Action upon the Caſe upon an <hi>Aſſumpſit</hi> brought againſt the
Defendant, The Plaintiffe declared, How that one <hi>Hallingworth</hi>
who was the Defendants Husband, was indebted unto the Plaintiffe
eight pound ten ſhillings for beer; and that he died, and that after his
death the Plaintiff demanded the ſaid mony of the Defendant his wife;
and ſhe, in conſideration that he would ſerve her withbeer, promiſed
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:40982:107"/>
that ſhe would pay unto the ſaid Plaintiff eight pound ten ſhillings, and
for the reſt of the beer, at ſuch a day certain. And the Plaintiffe did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verr,
That he did ſell and deliver to her Beer, and gave her day for the
payment of the other money, as alſo for the Beer delivered unto her;
and that at the day ſhe did not pay the Money. <hi>Cook</hi> and all the other
Juſtices agreed, That the Action would well lie, and that it was a good
Aſſumpſit, and a good conſideration; for they ſaid, That the forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of the money is a good conſideration of it ſelfe; and they ſaid,
That in every Aſſumpſit, he who makes the promiſe ought to have bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
thereby; and the other is to ſuſtain ſome loſſe. And judgement was
given for the Plaintiff.</p>

291 NORTON and LYSTERS Caſe.</head>
            <p>IN the Caſe of a Prohibition, the Caſe was this, Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>
was ſeiſed of the Manor of <hi>Nammington,</hi> which did extend into four
Pariſhes, viz. <hi>Stangrave</hi> and three other. And the Plaintiff ſhewed,
That he was ſeiſed of three Cloſes in <hi>Stangrave;</hi> and preſcribed, That
the ſaid Queen, and all thoſe whoſe Eſtate he hath in the ſaid Cloſes,
had a <hi>Modus decimandi</hi> for the ſaid three Cloſes, and for all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanes
of the ſaid Manor in <hi>Stangrave.</hi> And whether the <hi>Venire faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi>
ſhould be <hi>de parochia de Stangrave,</hi> or of the Manor, was the queſtion.
And it was reſolved by the whole Court, That the <hi>Viſne</hi> ſhould be of
the Pariſh of <hi>Stangrave</hi> and not of the Manor. And the Difference
was taken, when one claimes any thing which goes unto the whole Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
and when only to parcel of it; for in the one Caſe the <hi>Viſne</hi> ſhall
be of the Manor, in the other not; <hi>Vide 9. Eliz. Dyer. ar.</hi> But it was
ſaid, That in this Caſe the <hi>Modus</hi> did extend only to things in <hi>Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave,</hi>
and therefore the <hi>Viſne</hi> ſhould be of <hi>Stangrave</hi> only. <hi>Nichols</hi>
Juſtice ſaid, That although the Pariſh be a Town, and of one name,
yet the <hi>Viſne</hi> ſhall be from the Pariſh, to which the Court agreed.
And in the principall Caſe, the Pleading was, That the Manor was <hi>in
Parochia,</hi> and the <hi>Modus</hi> alledged to be <hi>in Parochia,</hi> and the Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<hi>de Parochia;</hi> and therefore the <hi>Venire facias</hi> ought to be <hi>de Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia,</hi>

that in Treſpaſs <hi>de Parochia</hi> is a good addition, for it ſhall not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,

it was holden by the Court, that ſuch <hi>tales</hi> might be well awarded; and
<hi>10. Eliz. Dyer</hi> vouched to prove the ſame. It was alſo ſaid by the

of odd number, as <hi>quinque tales,</hi> or <hi>novem tales;</hi> but now ſince the
Statute of 35. <hi>H.</hi> 8. the <hi>tales</hi> may be even or odd, as pleaſeth the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

293 MILLER againſt REIGNOLDS and BASSET.</head>
            <p>SIr <hi>Henry Mountagu</hi> the Kings Serjeant did informe the Lords in the
Star-Chamber, How that the Defendants had conſpired and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed
<hi>Malitioſè</hi> to draw the Plaintiffs life in queſtion, being a man of
One thouſand Pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> and otherwiſe very rich. The Caſe was
ſhortly thus, <hi>Baſset</hi> the Defendant was Tenant unto the Plaintiffe of a
houſe in <hi>R.</hi> in Kent, rendring a Rent; the rent was behind, and the
Plaintiff demanded his Rent of him; the Defendant told him, That he
was not able to ſatisfie him the Rent, but he promiſed to give unto the
Plaintiffe all his Goods in ſatisfaction of the Rent, or ſo many of them
as ſhould countervaile the Rent; and it was agreed betwixt the Plaintiff
and the Defendant <hi>Baſset,</hi> that the Goods ſhould be appriſed by two
men, which was done accordingly, and the Plaintiff came to the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants
houſe at the time the ſaid Goods were appriſed, but it was depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
and proved, did not go out of the room where the appriſement was
made at the time he was in the ſaid houſe, which was the 10 of <hi>May 7.
Jacobi, ar.</hi> Afterwards the Defendants, <hi>Reignolds</hi> (being an Atturny at
Law) and <hi>Baſset,</hi> did conſpire to accuſe the Plaintiffe, becauſe that when
he came to the Defendant <hi>Baſsets</hi> houſe at the time of the appriſing
of the ſaid Goods, that the Plaintiffe went up into an upper
Chamber in the ſaid houſe, and broke up a Cheſt, and out of the ſame
took a Gold Ring, 10. s. in Money, and the Defendant <hi>Baſsets</hi> Leaſe
of his houſe; and thereupon brought the Plaintiff before divers Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the Peace, who upon Examination of the matter, found no ground
of ſuſpicion againſt the Plaintiff, and therefore they did not bind him
over to the Seſsions to anſwer the ſame Accuſation. After this the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants
made ſeverall motions to the Plaintiff that he would give unto
them 300<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. and ſo he ſhould be acquitted, and there ſhould be no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
againſt him; and becauſe the Plaintiffe refuſed ſo to do, they
told him that divers Courtiers had begged his Eſtate of the King, and
that the ſame was granted unto them; when as in truth, there was not
any thing moved to any Courtier of any ſuch matter, but all this was
ſaid in a ſhew only, to the end they might get great ſums ef mony from
him. And in that matter they layed the ſcandall upon S. <hi>Rob. Car</hi> then
Viſcount <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> that he was made privy to it, who then was the
Kings Maj. great Favorite. And when all this could not prevail to gain
any Compoſition from the Plaintiff, the Defendants did prefer a Bill of
Indictment at the Aſſizes in Kent againſt the Plaintiff; and there, upon
Evidence given unto the Grand Jury, they found an <hi>Ignoramus</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:40982:109"/>
the Bill: and divers other plots and diviſes were contrived by the
Defendants, &amp; all to the end, the Plaintiff might loſe his life &amp; his eſtate.
And this matter came to Sentence before the Lords, and the Bill
proved in every point and circumſtance, as well by the confeſſion of
the Defendants themſelves, as by divers writings, depoſitions of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
and letters read and ſhewed in open Court; and it was ſaid by
the whole Court of Lords in this caſe, that this was a very great
offence, and an offence <hi>in Capite<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and that if ſuch practices ſhould be
ſuffered and go unpuniſhed, that no mans life was in ſafety, but in
continual jeopardy: And therefore in this caſe, it was ſaid, that
pregnant preſumption had been ſufficient to have acquited the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff;
but here the caſe was very cleer, becauſe the matter was confeſſed
by the parties Defendants themſelves. And in this caſe, <hi>Cook</hi> Chief
Juſtice, and the Lord Chancellour ſaid, that a conſpiracy ought not to
be onely falſe, but <hi>malitioſe</hi> contrived, otherwiſe it will not be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy,
and ſuch malice ought to be proved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For if a poor Man tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling
upon the High-way, be robbed by another Man, and he knows
not the party, if afterwards he do accuſe ſuch a one of the Robbery,
and the party accuſed be found not Guilty; he ſhall not have an
Action of conſpiracy againſt the accuſer; for although he was falſly
accuſed, yet he was not malitiouſly accuſed; and it might be, that he
took him to be the Offender, becauſe he was like unto him who rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
him. Secondly, It was ſaid by them, that by the Law, no Man
may Begg the Lands or Goods of another man upon ſuch an accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
until the party be convict of the fact; and that for divers cauſes.
1. Becauſe before conviction, the King hath not an Intereſt in them; for
the goods are not forfeit. And 2. Becauſe the party till his conviction,
ought to have his goods to maintain himſelf with them. And 3. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the goods cannot be ſeiſed upon for the Kings uſe before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction,
although they may be put <hi>in ſalva cuſtodia;</hi> and therefore
they ſaid, that this was a very great ſlander which the Defendants layed
upon the Lord Viſcount <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> viz. that he had begged the
Plaintiffs goods of the King before he was convicted; and it was ſaid,
that if ſuch goods ſhould be begged before conviction of the party,
that the ſame would be a main cauſe, that the Jury will not find the
Indictment againſt the party, when they are ſure his Lands, goods, and
other eſtate ſhall be in anothers perſon, and ſo by conſequence ſhould
be a great cauſe that the King might be defrauded of the forfeiture of
the goods of Fellons: and further, it would be a great cauſe of Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
if ſuch Lands and goods ſhould be ſeiſed upon and given away
before conviction of the party accuſed. And as the Lord Chancellour
ſaid, the ſame was the cauſe of the great Rebellion in the time of King
<hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, becauſe the goods of divers were given away to other
men before the parties were convicted: And <hi>Cook</hi> ſaid, that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:40982:109"/>
that this was not onely a ſcandal of divers Gentlemen of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
whom the Defendants had abuſed in this thing, But even of the
King himſelf: And it was not onely <hi>ſcandalum Magnatum:</hi> But <hi>ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalum
Magiſtr. Magnatum:</hi> And he ſaid, that it appears in <hi>Britton,</hi>
that if a Rebel or baſe fellow do ſtrike a Man of Dignity, that he ſhall
loſe his right hand: <hi>à fortiori,</hi> in ſuch caſe when they defame and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalize
them by ſuch impudent practices, that they be grievouſly
puniſhed: And it ſhould be a very unhappy eſtate to be a Rich-Man,
if ſuch Offences ſhould not ſeverely be puniſhed, <hi>&amp; multi delicti propter

being an Attorney to be degraded, caſt over the Common Pleas Barre,

And therefore in the principall Caſe, becauſe that upon the <hi>Fieri facias</hi>

Execution will pay the other twenty five pound, (the whole Judgment

            <p>IT was moved for a Prohibition to the Court of Requeſts, becauſe that

compel a man to attorn upon a Covenant to ſtand ſeiſed to uſes. And <hi>per

there were three Cauſes in the Bill, for which a Prohibition ſhould be
granted, which he reduced to three Queſtions. 1. If a Copy-holder payeth
his rent, and the Lord maketh a Feoffment of the Manor, Whether the
Copy-holder ſhall be compelled to attorn? 2. If a man be ſeiſed of
Freehold Land, and Covenants to ſtand ſeiſed to an uſe, Whether
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:40982:110"/>
in ſuch caſe an Attornment be needfull? 3. If a Feoffment be made of
a Manor by Deed, Whether the Feoffee ſhall compell the Tenants to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torn
in a Court of Equity? And for all theſe Queſtions, It was ſaid,
That the Tenants ſhall not be compelled to attorn; for upon a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
and Sale, and a Covenant to ſtand ſeiſed, there needs no attrone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And <hi>Cook</hi> in this caſe ſaid, That in 21. <hi>E.</hi> 4. the Juſtices ſaid,
That all Cauſes may be ſo contrived, that there needed to be no Suit
in Courts of Equity; and it appears by our books, That a Prohibition
lies to a Court of Equity, when the matter hath been once determined by
Law. And 13. <hi>E. 3. Tit. Prohibition,</hi> and the Book called the Diverſity

298 Sir JOHN GAGE and SMITH's Caſe.</head>
            <p>AN Action of Waſte was brought, and the Plaintiffe did declare,
that contrary to the Statute, the Leſſee had committed Waſte and
Deſtruction in uncovering of a Barn, by which the timber thereof was
become rotten and decayed; and in the deſtroying of the ſtocks of
Elmes, Aſhes, Whitethorn and Blackthorn, to his damage of three
hundred pound. And for title ſhewed, That his Father was ſeiſed of the
Land, where &amp;c. in Fee, and leaſed the ſame to the Defendant for one
and twenty years, and died; and that the Land deſcended to him as his ſon
and heir; and ſhewed, that the Waſte was done in his time, and that
the Leaſe is now expired The Defendant pleaded the generall iſſue,
and it was found for the Plaintiffe, and damages were aſſeſſed by
the Jury to fifty pound. And in this caſe it was agreed by the whole
Court, 1. That if ſix of the Jury are examined upon a <hi>Voyer dire,</hi> if
they have ſeen the place waſted, that it is ſufficient, and the reſt of the
Jury need not be examined upon a <hi>Voyer dire,</hi> but onely to the
principall. 2. It was agreed, if the Jury be ſworn that they know
the place, it is ſufficient, although they be not ſworn that they ſaw it;
and although that the place waſted be ſhewed to the Jury by the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff's
ſervants, yet if it be by the commandment of the Sheriffe, it is as
ſufficient, as if the ſame had been ſhewed unto them by the Sheriff him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.
4. It was reſolved, That the eradicating of Whitethorn is
waſte, but not of the Blackthorn; according to the Books in 46. <hi>E.</hi> 3.
and 9. <hi>H.</hi> 6. but if the blackthorn grow in a hedg, and the whole hedg
be deſtroyed the ſame is Waſte by <hi>Cook</hi> chief Juſtice. It was holden al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:40982:111"/>
ſo, that it is not Waſt to cut Quick-ſet hedges, but it ſhall be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
rather good husbandry, becauſe they will grow the better. 5. It
was agreed, That if a man hath under-woods of Haſell, Willowes,
Thornes, if he uſeth to cut them, and ſell them every ten years; If the
Leſſee fell them, the ſame is no waſt; but if he dig them up by the
roots, or ſuffereth the Germinds to be bitten with cattel after they
are felled, ſo as they will not grow again, the ſame is a deſtruction of
the Inheritance, and an Action of waſt will lie for it. But if he mow
the Stocks with a wood-ſythe, (as he did in the principall Caſe) the
ſame is a malicious Waſt; and continuall mowing and biting is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.
6. It was ſaid, That in an Action of Waſt a man ſhall not
have coſts of Suit, becauſe the Law doth give the party treble dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
And when the generall iſſue <hi>(Nul. Waſt)</hi> is pleaded, and the
Plaintiff counted to his damages 100<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. the Court doubted whether they
could mitigate the damage. But 7. It was agreed, That in the principal
Caſe, (although the iſſue were found for the Plaintiff;) that he could not
have judgment, becauſe he declared of Waſt done in 8. ſeveral cloſes, to
his damage of 300<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. generally, and did not ſever the damages. And the
Jury found, That in ſome of the ſaid Cloſes there was no Waſt commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
Wherefore the Court ſaid, he could not have judgement through
his own default. But afterwards at another day, <hi>Hobart</hi> then chief Juſtice,
and <hi>Warburton</hi> Juſtice, ſaid, That the verdict was ſufficient, and good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough;
and ſo was alſo the declaration, and that the Plaintiffe might
have judgment thereupon. But yet the ſame was adjourned by the Court

            <p>IN an Action of Waſt brought, the Writ was, That the Abbot and

Court that it was good, although it had been better, if the Writ had
been, That the Abbot with the aſſent of the Covent made the Leaſe, for
that is the uſuall form; but in ſubſtance the Writ is good, becauſe the
Covent being dead Sons in Law, by no intendment can be ſaid to
make a Leaſe; But the Dean and Chapter ought of neceſſity to joyne
in making of a Leaſe, becauſe they are all perſons able; and if the Dean
make a Leaſe without the Chapter, the ſame is not good, <hi>per curiam,</hi>

301 The Dean and Canons of Winſor and WEBB's Caſe.</head>
            <p>IN this Caſe it was holden by the Court, That if a man give Lands
unto Dean and Canons, and to their Succeſſors, and they be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved;
or unto any other Corporations; that the Donor ſhall have
back the Lands again, for the ſame is a condition in Law annexed to
the Gift; and in ſuch Caſe no Writ of Eſcheat lieth, yet the Land is
in him in the nature of an Eſcheat. And the principall Caſe was, That
a preſcription was ſhewed of a diſcharge of Tithes in an Abbot, Prior,
and Covent, and that the Corporation was afterwards diſſolved, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
all the Monks died, and the Abbot alſo. And it was holden by
the Court, That he who is now Owner of it, and holdeth the Lands,
ſhall pay Tithes; for a Lay man cannot preſcribe in <hi>Non decimando;</hi>
and the Preſcription continues no longer then the Lands continued in
the Abbot and Covents hands. And in this Caſe it was ſaid by <hi>Cook.</hi>
That there are only three manner of Eſcheats: 1. <hi>Abjurat Regnum.
2. Quia ſuſpenſus per collum. 3. Quia utlagatus:</hi> But becauſe they
ſued for the treble value in the Spiritual Court, a Prohibition was awar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;

words of the Statute of 2. <hi>E.</hi> 6. and ſo it was adjudged in <hi>Manwoods</hi>
Caſe in the Exchequer. And the word [Forfeiture] in the Statute doth
not give the treble value to the King, but to the Parſon himſelf. Alſo
it was holden by <hi>Cook</hi> and <hi>Warburton,</hi> Juſtices, That if a Rent be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to one and his Succeſſors, and the Corporation be diſſolved, that the

303 Sir DANIEL NORTON and SYMM's Caſe.</head>
            <p>AN Action of Debt was brought upon a Bond, which was conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
to performe Covenants in an Indenture; and it was ſhewed
there were divers Covenants in the Deed, ſome of which were Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
againſt the Law, and ſome not; and for breach, the Plaintiff
alledged, That it was covenanted by the Indenture, that <hi>Chamberlain,</hi>
for whom the Defendant was a Surety, being under Sheriff to the
Plaintiffe, ſhould ſave the Plaintiffe harmeleſſe, and ſhould diſcharge
all manner of eſcapes, and ſhould alſo ſave him harmeleſs from all Fines
and Amercements to which he ſhould be liable by reaſon of any eſcape.
And ſhewed, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ow that one was arreſted in execution by the ſaid <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain,
&amp; evaſit.</hi> And another Covenant was, That hee ſhould not
ſerve any Execution above Twenty Pounds, without Warrant from the
Plaintiffe; and alſo that he ſhould not return any Juries without his
Privity. <hi>Hutton</hi> Serjeant argued for the Defendant and ſaid, That this
Indenture of Covenants was againſt the Law, for it is as much as if he
had ſaid, That he ſhould not he under Sheriff. And by the Statute of
<hi>27. El.</hi> under Sheriffs are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

Rices</hi> caſe. And he compared theſe Covenants againſt the Law to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuities
which kill themſelves. Then he argued, That although ſome
of the Covenants were lawfull, yet the Bond was void in all; and
that, he ſaid, is the better opinion of the book in 14. H. 8. 25. And if
<hi>A.</hi> be bounden to enfeoff <hi>J. S.</hi> of the Manor of <hi>D.</hi> and to diſeaſe <hi>J. N.</hi>
of another Manor, the Bond is void for the whole. 3. He ſaid, That
there was not a ſufficient breach laid by the plaintiffe; for it is only
layed, That ſuch a one in Execution <hi>evaſit;</hi> and it is not ſaid, That
the under Sheriff did ſuffer him to eſcape. 4. It is not layed, That
the plaintiff did requeſt the under Sheriffe to pay the Money upon the
eſcape, but he went and paid the Money voluntarily of himſelf, and
requeſt and notice are needfull; 46. <hi>E. 3. 27. 22. E. 4. 14. 40. E. 3. 20
Non damnificatus</hi> is a good plea generally; and the other ſide ought to
come and ſhew ſpecially how he is damnified. 5. It is not layed,
That he gave him warning to arreſt the party in Execution for Fifty
pounds; and therefore as to that, he was not under Sheriff, becauſe
as Sheriff, without warning, by his former Covenants, hee was not to
ſerve any Executions, but ſuch as were under Twenty pounds; and
therefore he ought to have layed it, That he gave him a Warrant to
arreſt the party upon this Execution, otherwiſe there is no breach. <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi>
Serjeant contrary, and he ſaid, The Covenants are ſufficient in part,
and ought to be performed; and ſo the Bond good. And as <hi>K<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſaid in 13. H. 7. 23. ſo he ſaid, That there are three conditions which
are not allowable, but the Caſe at Bar is not within the compaſſe of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them; and the words here [Diſcharge and ſave harmeleſſe] ſhall
be meant from all eſcapes ſuffered by the under Sheriff himſelf; and the
words [from all Amercements whatſoever] ſhall be intended by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of his Office: And he ſaid, That when an Indenture of Covenants
is good in part, and void in part, thoſe Covenants which are good
ſhall ſtand and ought to be performed; and the book of 14. <hi>H.</hi> 8 by
four Juſtices, is, that all legal and lawful Covenants ought to be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
and he vouched <hi>Lee</hi> and <hi>Golſhills</hi> Caſe 39. <hi>Eliz.</hi> which <hi>Vide c. 5.

pleaded, That he hath performed all the Covenants; and if theſe Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
be void, and no Covenants, then the Defendants plea is not good.
Alſo there are divers Covenants in the Negative, and to thoſe he ought
in pleading to ſhew in certain that he hath not broken them. The Court
ſaid, nothing at all to the caſe; but yet <hi>Cook</hi> chief Juſtice ſeemed to be

the Libel ſhe prayed allowance of Allimony; and a Prohibition was
prayed by him, becauſe the Suit in that Court was for a force, which
was not triable in that Court; and to that purpoſe he remembred the
caſe of <hi>11, H.</hi> 4. 88. Where a Clark ſued in the Spiritual Court for a
battery, and laying of violent hands upon him, and becauſe in ſuch
caſe an action of Treſpas of aſſault and battery did lye at the Common

cannot have remedy againſt the Husband at the Common Law for the
beating of her, becauſe ſhe is <hi>ſub virga viri;</hi> and alſo becauſe the Suit

Whether the ſame were void, or not within the ſaid Statute? The Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices

And for that defect the utlagary was reverſed, and it was ſaid, that it
was as much as if no Exigent had been awarded at all: And upon the
Reverſall of the utlagary, a Superſedeas was awarded; and the party
reſtored to his goods which were taken in Execution upon the <hi>Capias

taken in Execution to the Plaintiffs Atturney, it is as well as if he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered

by his Bill that the Enfant being within age, did promiſe him to pay the

have an action of Debt at the common Law, upon the contract for the
ſame, becauſe they were things for his neceſſary livelihood and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.

that <hi>Levavit quandam domum ad nocumentum, &amp;c.</hi> And the
Plaintiff ſhewed how that he had a Windmil, and that the Defendant
had built the ſaid houſe, ſo as it hindred his Mill: And the Jury found
that the Defendant <hi>levavit domum;</hi> and that but two feet of it did hinder
the Plaintiffs Mill, and is <hi>ad nocumentum.</hi> And how Judgment ſhould
be given, was the queſtion. And the Court was of opinion, That Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſhould be, that but part of the houſe ſhould be abated, <hi>viz.</hi> That
which was found to be <hi>ad nocumentum.</hi> And it was ſaid by ſome, That
the Aſſiſe is ſuch a Writ which extends to the whole houſe; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that the whole houſe ſhould be abated according to the Writ. But
a difference was taken betwixt the words <hi>Erexit</hi> and <hi>Levavit:</hi> For,
<hi>Erexit</hi> is but when parcel of a houſe is ſet up <hi>ad nocumentum;</hi> but <hi>Leva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit</hi>
is when an entire houſe is levied from the ground. And it was ſaid
by <hi>Hobart</hi> Chief Juſtice, That if the Defendant had not levied the houſe
ſo high by two yards, it had been no Nuſans: for the Jury find, that the
two yards only are <hi>ad nocumentum.</hi> And therefore he conceived that the
Writ was anſwered well enough; and that but part of the houſe ſhould
be abated: For the Writ is, <hi>Quod levavit quandam domum, &amp;c.</hi> And
the Verdict is, <hi>Quod levavit domum;</hi> But that but two yards of it is <hi>ad

were ſet forth, that he did take back thirty ſheafs thereof, and thereupon
prayed a Prohibition. And in this Caſe it was ſaid by the Court, That it
ought to be averred, that the Farm was a great Farm, for otherwiſe it
ſhould be the impoveriſhing of the Church, and would take away a
great part of the profit of the Parſon. And it was further ſaid by the
Court, That if there were but thirty Tythe-ſheafs in all, that the Owner
ſhould not have them, for then the Cuſtom ſhould be unreaſonable:

Caſe.</head>
            <p>IN an Action of Treſpaſs for taking away of Timber, and the Boughs
of Trees felled: The Defendant, as to the Timber, pleaded <hi>Not guilty;</hi>
And as to the Boughs, he made a ſpecial Juſtification, That there is a
Cuſtom within the Mannor of <hi>Aſhenhurſt</hi> in the County of <hi>Suſſex,</hi> That
when the Lord fels or ſels Timber-trees, that the Lord is to have only
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:40982:117"/>
the Timber, and that the poor Tenants in <hi>Coſcagio parte Manerii,</hi> time
out of mind have uſed to have the Branches of the Trees for neceſſary
Eſtovers to be burnt <hi>in neceſſario focali in terris &amp; tenementis.</hi> And the
Opinion of the Court was, That the Cuſtom was not well expreſſed, to
have Eſtovers to burn <hi>in terris &amp; tenementis;</hi> for that Eſtovers cannot be
appertaining to Lands, but to Houſes only: And therefore whereas the
Defendant in the Caſe did entitle himſelf to a houſe and lands, and gave
in Evidence that the Cuſtom did extend to Lands, it was holden that the
Evidence did not maintain the Iſſue; And the Cuſtom was alleadged
to be, That the Lord ſhould have <hi>Quicquid valeret ad maremium,</hi> and
that the Freeholders ſhould have <hi>ramillos.</hi> Which as <hi>Hobart</hi> Chief Juſtice
ſaid, is to be meant all the Arms and Boughs; for whatſoever is not
<hi>maremium,</hi> is <hi>ramillum.</hi> 2. It was holden in this Caſe, That the Non-uſe
or Negligence in not taking of the Boughs, did not extinguiſh nor take
away the Cuſtom, as it hath been oftentimes reſolved in the like caſe.
And note that in this Caſe, to confirm the ſaid Cuſtom, the Book-caſe
was cited, which is in 14. <hi>E. 3. Fitz. t' Bar.</hi> 277. and the ſame was given
in and avowed for good Evidence: where the Caſe was, That the Biſhop
of <hi>C.</hi> (which ſhall be intended the Biſhop of <hi>Chicheſter)</hi> brought an
Action of Treſpaſs for felling of Trees, and carrying them away: where
the Defendant pleaded, That he held a Meſſuage and a Verge of Land
of the Biſhop; and that all the Tenants of the Biſhop within the Manor
of <hi>A.</hi> ought to have all the Windfals of Trees, and all the Boughs and
Branches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which Caſe, as <hi>Harris</hi> Serjeant conceived, was the Caſe
of the very Mannor now in queſtion; and the Tenant there (as in this
Caſe) made a ſpecial Juſtification, and there it was holden that it was
good, and adjudged for the Defendant: Alſo in that Caſe it was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged,
That the Lord ſhould have <hi>Maremium,</hi> and that the Tenants
ſhould have <hi>Reſiduum,</hi> which ſhall be intended the Boughs and Branches.
And the Cuſtom in the Caſe was adjudged good. But becauſe the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant
alleadged the Cuſtom to be, to have the ſame as Eſtovers to be
burned <hi>in terris,</hi> and gave Evidence only to the Meſſuage, it was found
againſt the Defendant, for that the Evidence did not maintain the
Iſſue.</p>

whole Court, That the Conveyance did paſs only the Lands which he
had by purchaſe, except only the ſaid Houſe which was preciſely named
and conveyed; and did not paſs the Lands which he had by Diſcent.
For if all the Lands which he had by Diſcent ſhould paſs by the general
words, then the ſpecial words which paſſed the Houſe which he had by
Diſcent ſhould be idle and frivolous; and that was one reaſon <hi>ex viſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus
cauſae,</hi> that only the purchaſed Lands did paſs. 2. It was ſaid by
Juſtice <hi>Warburton,</hi> That if a man giveth all his Lands in <hi>D.</hi> in the Tenures
of <hi>A.</hi> &amp; <hi>B.</hi> and he hath Lands in <hi>D.</hi> but not in their Tenures, that in that
caſe all his Lands in <hi>D.</hi> paſſeth: So if a man give all his Lands in <hi>D.</hi> which
he had by Diſcent, from his ſon, there all his Lands whatſoever ſhall paſs.
<hi>Hobart acc'</hi> and ſaid, That if a man gives all his Lands in the County of
<hi>Kent,</hi> if he have Lands within the County, they do paſs. And he ſaid, that
in a Conveyance every reſtriction hath his proper operation; and in the
Conveyance in the principal caſe there were three reſtrictions: 1. All his

the Tenures of ſuch men, <hi>viz. A. B. C.</hi> 3. All his lands which he had by
Purchaſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the words <hi>(All my Lands)</hi> are to be intended all
thoſe my Lands which are within the reſtrictions. And he ſaid, that the
word <hi>(Et)</hi> being in the copulative, was not material; for all was but
one ſentence, and it did not make ſeveral ſentences and the word <hi>Et</hi> is
but the concluſion of the ſentence. 3. They reſolved, That general words
in a Grant may be overthrown by words reſtrictive; as is <hi>2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> E.</hi> 4. and
<hi>Plow. Com. Hill.</hi> &amp; <hi>Granges</hi> Caſe. And therefore if a man giveth all his
lands in <hi>D.</hi> which he hath by Diſcent from his Father; if he have no
lands by Diſcent from his Father, nothing paſſeth. 4. They agreed, That
a Reſtriction may be in a ſpecial Grant, as in <hi>C. 4. par. Ognels</hi> Caſe: but
they ſaid, that if the Reſtriction doth not concur and meet with the
Grant, that then the Reſtriction is void. Note, the principal Caſe was
adjudged according to theſe Reſolutions.</p>

293. COOPER and ANDREWS Caſe.</head>
            <p>TO have a Prohibition to the Spiritual Court, ſuggeſtion was made,
That the Lord <hi>De la Ware</hi> was ſeiſed of 140 Acres of lands in the
County of <hi>Suſſex,</hi> which were parcel of a Park. And a <hi>Modus Decimandi</hi>
by Preſcription was ſaid to be, That the Tenants of the ſaid 140 Acres
for the time being had uſed to pay for the tythes of the ſaid 140 Acres
two ſhillings in mony, and a ſhoulder of every third Deer which was
killed in the ſame Park, in conſideration of all tythes of the ſaid Park:
And it was ſhewed, how that the Lord <hi>De la Ware</hi> had enfeoffed one
<hi>Cumber</hi> of the ſaid 140 acres of land; who bargained and ſold the ſaid
140 acres of land to the Plaintiffe who prayed the Prohibition. The
Defendant ſaid, that the ſaid Park is diſparked, and that the ſame is now
converted into arable lands and paſture-grounds, and ſo demanded tythes
in kind; upon which the Plaintiffe in the Prohibition did demur. <hi>Hutton</hi>
Serjeant. By the diſparking of the Park, the Preſcription is not gone nor
extinct; becauſe the Preſcription is ſaid to be to 140 acres of lands, and
not to the Park: and although the ſhoulder of the Deer, being but caſual
and at the pleaſure of the party, be gone, yet the ſame ſhall not make
void the Preſcription. 2. He ſaid, that the act of the party ſhall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
the Preſcription: and although it be not a Park now in form and
reputation, yet in Law the ſame ſtill remains a Park. And he compared
the Caſe unto <hi>Lutterels</hi> Caſe, <hi>C. 4. par.</hi> 48. where a Preſcription was to
Fulling-Mils, and afterwards the Mils were converted to Corn-Mils, yet
the Preſcription remained. 3. He ſaid, Admit it is not now a Park, yet
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:40982:119"/>
there is a poſſibility that it may be a Park again, and that Deer may be
killed there again. For the Diſparking in the principal Caſe is only al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged
to be, that the Pale is thrown down; which may be amended:
For although that all the Park-pale, or parcel of it be caſt down, yet the
ſame doth ſtill remain in Law a Park: and a Park is but a Liberty; and
the not uſing of a Liberty doth not determine it, nor any Preſcription
which goes with it. And if a man have Eſtovers in a Wood by Preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
if the Lord felleth down all the Wood, yet the right of Eſtovers
doth remain; and the Owner ſhall have an Aſſiſe for the Eſtovers, or
an Action upon the Caſe. <hi>Vid. C. 5. par.</hi> 78. in <hi>Grayes</hi> Caſe, the Caſe
vouched by <hi>Popham.</hi> Further he ſaid, That in the beginning a <hi>Modus
Decimandi</hi> did commence by Temporal act, and Spiritual; and the mony
is now the tythe, for which the Parſon may ſue in the Spiritual Court:
And a Caſe <hi>Mich. 5. Jacobi</hi> was vouched, where a Preſcription to pay a
Buck or a Doe in conſideration of all Tythes, was adjudged to be a good
Preſcription. And the Caſe <hi>Mich. 6. Jacobi,</hi> of <hi>Skipton</hi>-Park, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred:
where the difference was taken, when the Preſcription runs
to Land, and when to a Park. In the one caſe, although the Park be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parked,
the Preſcription doth remain; in the other not. And <hi>6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> E. 6.
Dyer</hi> 71. was vouched: That although the Park be diſparked, yet the
Fee doth remain. And ſo in the Caſe at Bar, although the caſual profit
be gone, yet the certain profit, which is the two ſhillings, doth remain.
<hi>Harris</hi> Serjeant contrary. And he ſaid, that the Conveyance was exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutory,
and the Agreement executory, and not like unto a Conveyance
or Agreement executed: And ſaid, that Tythes are due <hi>jure divino;</hi> and
that the party ſhould not take advantage of his own wrong, but that now
the Parſon ſhould have the tythes in kind. And upon the difference of
Executory and Executed, he vouched many Authorities, <hi>viz. 16<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Eliz.
Dyer 335. Calthrops</hi> Caſe, 15 <hi>E. 4. 3. 5 E.</hi> 4. 7. &amp; 32 <hi>E.</hi> 3. Anuitie 245.
And in this caſe he ſaid, that the Parſon hath no remedy for the ſhoulder
of the Deer; and therefore he prayed a Conſultation. <hi>Hobart</hi> Chief
Juſtice ſaid, That the Pleading was too ſhort, and it was not ſufficiently
pleaded: For it is not pleaded, That the Park is ſo diſparked that all the
benefit thereof is loſt. But he agreed it, That if a man doth pull down
his Park-pale, that the ſame is a diſparking without any ſeiſure of the
Liberty into the Kings hands, by a <hi>Quo Warranto.</hi> But yet all the Court
agreed, That it doth yet remain a Park in habit: And they were all alſo
of opinion That the diſparking the Park of the Deer, was not any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parking
of the Park as to take away the Preſcription. The Caſe was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed

            <p>IN an action upon the Caſe, the caſe was, That the Defendant did
exhibite Articles againſt the Plaintiff in the Chancery before Dr. <hi>Cary,</hi>
and there ſwore the Articles; and afterwards he ſued in the Kings Bench,
and had Proceſs out of that Court upon the Articles ſworn in Chancery:
and for this an action upon the Caſe was brought, and it was adjudged
that the action would lie. The articles exhibited in the Chancery were,
That the Plaintiff being an Attorney at Law, was a Mainteinor of Juries
and Cauſes, and a Barretor: and the Defendant prayed the Peace againſt
him in the Kings Bench. And in this Caſe it was reſolved, 1. That a
man might pray the Peace or Good Behaviour of any other man in any
of the Kings Courts: but then it muſt be done in due form of Law:
and if he do it ſo, no action upon the Caſe will lie, as it was reſolved
<hi>27 Eliz.</hi> in <hi>Cutler</hi> and <hi>Dixons</hi> caſe in the Kings Bench. But it was agreed,
that if a man ſueth in a Court which hath not juriſdiction of the <hi>Cauſe,</hi>
an action upon the Cauſe will lie, but not where the Court hath juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Cauſe. 2. It was reſolved, That the action did lie in the Caſe
at Bar, becauſe he did exhibite the articles in Chancery, and did not
purſue them there; For when he had ſworn the articles in the Chancery,
he could not have a <hi>Supplicavit</hi> out of the Kings Bench; and the Oath
and <hi>Affidavit</hi> in the Chancery doth remain as a Scandal upon Record.
And <hi>Hobart</hi> Chief Juſtice ſaid, That every Court ought to intermeddle
with their own proper cauſes; and that two Courts are not to joyn in
one puniſhment, for puniſhment is not to be by parcels. And he ſaid,
That if a man claimeth right to the Land of another, he is not puniſhable
for it; but if he make title vnto a Stranger, then he ſhall be puniſhed:
for every one ought to meddle with his own buſineſs. 3. It was reſolved,
That when a thing doth concern the Commonwealth, the ſame doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
every one in particular. And ſo it is lawful for any man to require
the Good behaviour of another, for the publique good: <hi>Intereſt etenim
reipublicae ut maleficia punientur.</hi> 4. It was reſolved, that the action
did lie; becauſe the Defendant made the articles in Chancery but a
colour of the Good Behaviour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and although that the Kings Bench
might grant the Good Behaviour without any articles preferred, yet
when firſt they begin in another Court, they ought to follow the cauſe
there: And <hi>Hobart</hi> the Chief Juſtice, in this caſe ſaid, that an Attorney
may not labour Jurors in the behalf of his Client, for that is Imbracery.</p>

made their Arbitrement and Award within ten dayes: and if they do

day after the Submiſſion they did nominate <hi>J. N.</hi> to be Umpier, who
made an Award within the ſaid ten dayes; and the Defendant would
not perform the Award, wherefore the Plaintiffe brought the action.
<hi>Sherley</hi> Serjeant. It is repugnant: For the firſt Arbitrators had the
whole ten dayes to make their Award, and then cannot the Umpier
make an Award within the ſaid ten dayes. But the opinion of the whole
Court was, that the action would lie; and that it ſhould be conſtrued
thus, <hi>viz.</hi> That if an arbitrement and award be made within ten dayes
by the firſt Arbitrators or by the Umpier: For the firſt Arbitrators may

            <p>AN action upon the Caſe was brought for words. The Plaintiffe ſet
forth in his Declaration, That he was a Mercer by his trade, and did
ſell wares and commodities in his ſhop, and did keep divers Books of his
trade, and Debt-books: and that the Defendant ſaid unto Mr. <hi>Palmer,</hi>

<pb n="242" facs="tcp:40982:121"/>
Your Son-in-Law</hi> Brooks <hi>deceived me in a Reckoning, and he keepeth
in his ſhop a falſe Debt-book, And I will ſhame him in his Calling.
Nichols</hi> Juſtice, and <hi>Hobart</hi> Chief Juſtice were of opinion, that the action
would not lie for thoſe words: 1. Becauſe the words ſingle of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
are not any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lander; and when words will bear an action, it ought
to be out of the force and ſtrength of the words themſelves. 2. The firſt
words, <hi>Thou haſt deceived me in a Reckoning</hi> will bear no action, becauſe
it is impoſſible but that Tradeſmen and Merchants which keep Debt-books
will ſometimes miſtake one Figure for another, and ſo the ſame
doth turn to the prejudice and damage of another againſt the will of the
party himſelf. And ſo the ſubſequent words, <hi>He keepeth a falſe Debt-book,</hi>
are not actionable, becauſe it may be falſified by the Servants of
the party, and not by the Defendant himſelf; and alſo it may be falſe
written. <hi>Et intereſt reipublicae ut ſit finis litium:</hi> and it ſhould be a
cauſe of many Suits, if ſuch a nice conſtruction ſhould be made of words
as to make them actionable; and words ſhall be taken <hi>in mitiori ſenſu,</hi>
if there be no particular deſcription and declaration that the words were
ſpoken maliciouſly. And therefore general words which of themſelves
are actionable, by conſtruction ſhall be taken to bear no action; as <hi>C. 4.
par. Stanhops</hi> caſe. And ſo if a man ſaith of another, that he hath the
Pox, they ſhall be taken <hi>in mitiori ſenſu,</hi> becauſe they are not deſcribed
by any ſubſequent words which declares malice in the party. And <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chols</hi>
vouched a Caſe which was in this Court this Term, where an action
was brought for theſe words; <hi>Thou uſeſt me now, as thy Wife did when
ſhe ſtole my Cuſhions:</hi> that the words were not actionable. <hi>Warburton</hi>
Juſtice. When words are ſpoken which ſcandal a man in his trade or
profeſſion, they are actionable: as if one ſay of an Attorney, <hi>Thou
coſeneſt Mr.</hi> Winſor <hi>of his Fees:</hi> and ſo if words are ſpoken maliciouſly.
And therefore an action was brought by one who was a Jury-man, for
theſe words, viz. <hi>Thou haſt deceived me any my children of eight hundred
pounds;</hi> they were adjudged actionable. And ſo <hi>Hill. 6. Jacobi. rot. 1159.
Thou art a Jury-man, and haſt been the death of a hundred men by thy

            <p>A Parſon did Libel in the Spiritual Court for Tythes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the ſubſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of them; and grounded his Libel upon the Statute of 2 <hi>E.</hi> 6.
The Defendant alleaged that he was to be diſcharged from the payment
of tythes, by reaſon of priviledge within the Statute of 31 <hi>H.</hi> 8. of Diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions:
and the Plaintiffe here had a Prohibition. And afterwards they
were at iſſue here, Whether he ought to be diſcharged hy Priviledge or
not; and after iſſue joyned, the Plaintiffe in the Prohibition was Non-ſuit:
And thereupon the Parſon had a Conſultation, and proceeded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in
the Spiritual Court, and there obtained a ſentence; and the ſentence
there was, That he ſhould recover the ſingle damages, and the ſame was
ſet in certain; and <hi>ulterius</hi> that <hi>recuperet duplicem valorem,</hi> which was
alſo by the ſaid ſentence ſet in certain. And it was reſolved in that Caſe
by the whole Court, That a Prohibition ſhould be granted grounded
upon the ſentence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe the Spiritual Court in their ſentence did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
the damages which was to be given by the Statute in that Court:
and it was ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That although the ſentence there given be not expreſsly
that he recover treble damages, yet becauſe it did amount to ſo much, if
the words of the ſentence be joyned together, It was directed that a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Prohibition, in which the Statute and the whole matter is to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
be awarded. And in this caſe it was agreed by the whole Court,
That the Statute of 2 <hi>

give any damages: but if the Tythe be firſt ſet forth, and then they are
ſubſtracted, there becauſe the Parſon had once an intereſt in them, he
ſhall recover treble damages. And the principal Caſe was reſembled by
<hi>Warburton</hi> Juſtice to the caſe of Waſte; that if the Jury give damages

               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there the Court ſhall treble the damages and make the ſame 60l<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>A Man Libelled for Tythes in the Spiritual Court: the Defendant
alleadged a <hi>Modus Decimandi,</hi> and thereupon had a Prohibition;
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:40982:123"/>
and afterwards the Plaintiffe in the Prohibition did not prove his ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion

            <p>AN action of falſe Impriſonment was brought againſt the Defendant
and two other Juſtices of Peace of the County of <hi>York.</hi> The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants
juſtified the Impriſonment, by reaſon of the Statute of 1 <hi>M. cap.</hi>
That it ſhould not be lawful for any maliciouſly and contumeliouſly to
moleſt or diſquiet any perſon or perſons which are Preachers, or after
ſhould be Preachers. And the Plaintiffe demurred upon the Plea in Bar
generally; and two Exceptions were taken to the Pleading: 1. Becauſe
the words of the Statute were miſrecited; for the words of the Statute
are in the disjunctive, <hi>maliciouſly or contumeliouſly:</hi> And the opinion of
the Court was, that when the precedent &amp; ſubſequent words disjunctive
are all of one ſenſe, that the word <hi>(Or)</hi> is all one with the copulative; but
where they are of divers natures (as by word or deed) it is otherwiſe.
The ſecond Exception was, That where the words were (by the greater
part of the Juſtices) the Recital was (by the better part of the Juſtices.)
But notwithſtanding theſe Exceptions, it was adjudged againſt the
Plaintiffe.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>CArtwright</hi> prayed a Prohibition; and the Caſe was this. <hi>A.</hi> lying
ſick upon his bed, made his Will; and afterwards ſaid unto his

               <hi>ſhall have twenty pounds more,
if you can ſpare it.</hi> And the Executor anſwered and ſaid, <hi>Yes forſooth:</hi>
but no Codicil was made of the ſame Legacie. And a Bill was preferred
in the Spiritual Court for the Legacie: whereupon the Executor prayed
a Prohibition. And it was holden by this Court, that although this
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:40982:123"/>
Court hath not power to hold plea of the thing Libelled for there in
the Spiritual Court, yet it hath power to limit the Juriſdictions of other
Courts; and if they abuſe their authority, to grant a Prohibition. <hi>Vid.

is, might give remedy to the perſon for the Legacie: For the ſame not
being annexed to the Will by a Codicil, it was but <hi>fidei commiſſum:</hi> and
ſo the doubt was, Whether the Spiritual Court might hold plea of it:
For if they cannot hold plea of it, then in this caſe a Prohibition may be
lawfully granted, although that this Court have not power nor juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
of the thing it ſelf. The Court would be adviſed of it, and

345. Sir CHRISTOPHER HEYDON's Caſe.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>GOdſall, Shepard</hi> &amp; <hi>Smith</hi> brought an Aſſiſe of <hi>Novel diſſeiſin</hi> againſt
Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Heydon,</hi> which was tryed at the Aſſiſes in <hi>Norfolk</hi>
before Sir <hi>Tho. Fleming</hi> Lord Chief Juſtice of <hi>England,</hi> and Juſtice
<hi>Dodderidge,</hi> which was found for the Plaintiffs, and Judgment was given
for them in the Court of Common-Pleas. And thereupon Sir <hi>Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
Heydon</hi> brought a Writ of Error in the Kings Bench; and aſſigned
for Error, That whereas the Judgment was given upon his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
the Judgment was entred, That the Plaintiffs did recover <hi>per
viſum Recognitorum Aſſiſe predict.</hi> And after argument in the Kings-Bench,
it was adjudged by the whole Court, that the Judgment given
in the Common-Pleas ſhould be affirmed, notwithſtanding the Error
aſſigned. And now to reverſe the Judgment given in the Kings Bench,
he brought another Writ of Error in Parliament. <hi>Cook</hi> Chief Juſtice ſaid,
That the Clarks of the Chancery ought not to make a Writ of Error to
the Parliament, unleſſe they have the Kings licence ſo to do. And it was
agreed by the whole Court, that a Writ of Error lieth in Parliament up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Tranſcript of the Record, without bringing of the Record it ſelf
in Parliament: For the Parliament is holden at the Kings pleaſure, and
may be diſſolved before the Errors be diſcuſſed; and ſo the Record it
ſelf cannot be brought here again, becauſe the Parliament which is a
higher Court was once poſſeſſed of it. 8 <hi>H. 5. Error</hi> 88. The ſame Law
in Error upon a Judgment given in <hi>Ireland, 5 E. 2. Error</hi> 89. where only
the Tranſcript of the Judgment is removed: For if the Record it ſelf
ſhould be brought into <hi>England,</hi> it might be that before it came hither
it ſhall be drowned in the ſea; and it is dangerous to commit a Record
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:40982:124"/>
to the mercy of the winds and ſea. And Error lieth to reverſe a Fine up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Tenor of the Record: and it is not neceſſary to bring the Fine
it ſelf, becauſe there is not any Chirographer in this Court to examine
it. At another day the ſame Term, <hi>George Crook</hi> and <hi>Noy</hi> took five
Exceptions to the ſaid Writ of Error: the firſt was, Becauſe the Writ
doth recite the Judgment to be <hi>in Aſſiſ. capt. coram Tho. Fleming Capital.
Juſticiar. ad Placita, &amp; Johannem Dodderidge milit. unum Juſtic. ad
Placit. coram nobis tent.</hi> And the Exception was, becauſe that this latter
addition was not to them both. <hi>Dodderidge</hi> Juſtice held, that the ſame
was no good Exception to abate the Writ of Error, becauſe the omiſſion
is only in the addition of Honour which is ſurpluſage, and the Perſon is
certain, and his power appears to take the Aſſiſe: and that Exception is
not in point of juriſdiction, but of denoting of the perſon; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is like the Caſe in 19 <hi>Eliz. Dyer,</hi> 356. which is a ſtronger Caſe, and
<hi>6 E. 6. Dyer</hi> 77. Haughton and <hi>Cook contr.</hi> But <hi>Crook</hi> Juſtice did agree
with <hi>Dodderidge,</hi> that the addition of the ſame was but ſurpluſage, and
that the Writ had been well enough without it. <hi>Cook</hi> Chief Juſtice held
the contrary: For then he varieth from their Commiſſion, which is
their authority; but if it had been left out in their Commiſſion, then
the Writ had been good enough. And he ſaid, that when a man meddles
with a thing which is but ſurpluſage, which he needed not to do, he muſt
recite the ſame ſubſtantially, otherwiſe his plea will be vitious. <hi>C. 4 par.
Palmers caſe.</hi> And when he maketh <hi>Tho. Fleming Capit. Juſtic. ad Placita</hi>
indefinitely, he varieth from the truth: for the ſtile is, <hi>Tho. Fleming
Capit. Juſtic. ad Placita coram Rege tent. Haughton</hi> Juſtice <hi>acc'</hi> and he
ſaid, that in every Writ of Error which is to remove a Record three things
ought to be expreſſed. 1. Mention is to be made before what perſon it
was taken, as the book is in 28 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 11. 2. It is to mention betwixt
whom it was, 9 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 4. 3. The manner of the caption is to be menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
whether by Writ or without Writ, 2 <hi>R.</hi> 3. 2 &amp; 3. and this Writ
faileth in the firſt of them, therefore he concluded that the VVrit ſhould
abate. <hi>Cook</hi> Chief Juſtice was of the ſame opinion, and agreed that
Miſnoſmer and variance are not to be favoured, if they be not ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
and eſſential, <hi>quae dant eſſe rebus:</hi> and he ſaid that the variance in
this caſe is of ſuch nature; For in many Records yet extant, and in the
time of King <hi>H.</hi> 3. it is to be found, that the Chief Juſtice of <hi>England</hi>
did ſit and give Judgment in the Common-Pleas and in the Exchequer;
and ſo then <hi>Capital. Juſtic. ad Placita</hi> is too general, becauſe he might ſit
and give Judgment in any of the ſaid Courts. The ſecond Exception was,
becauſe that the VVrit ſaith, <hi>Aſſiſa capta, &amp;c.</hi> and doth not ſay <hi>per breve,</hi>
nor <hi>ſine breve,</hi> nor doth ſay <hi>ſecundum legem &amp; conſuetudinem, &amp;c.</hi> For
in 43 <hi>Eliz.</hi> in the Caſe betwixt <hi>Cromwell</hi> and <hi>Andrews,</hi> it was adjudged
not good to ſay, That ſuch an Action came into the Common-Pleas out
of the Country, and doth not ſhew that it came by adjournment, or by
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:40982:124"/>
               <hi>Certlorari,</hi> or <hi>Mittimus.</hi> To which it was anſwered by <hi>Damport</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor
for the Plaintiff, that it is a ſtrong intendment that the Aſſiſe was
taken <hi>per breve,</hi> and therefore it needed not to be expreſſed, becauſe it is
a general, and not a ſpecial Aſſiſe. <hi>Crook</hi> Juſtice. The Exception is good;
for it is ſo general, that it cannot be intended which Aſſiſe it was: For
put caſe there were two Aſſiſes betwixt the ſame parties, it cannot be
known which Aſſiſe is intended. And of the ſame opinion was <hi>Haughton</hi>
Juſtice. <hi>Dodderidge</hi> contrary; and he ſaid, Notwithſtanding the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
the Record ought to be removed by the Writ: For the Judges
Conſcience may be well ſatisfied which Record is to be removed; And
here the Record which is to be removed is ſo preciſely ſhewed, that no
body can doubt of it which ought to be certified: And there are Records
removed by Writs of Error which are more dubious then this is, <hi>v. 19
Eliz. Dyer 356. 20 E.</hi> 3. But in this caſe the Writ is much enforced by
the words <hi>Sommon. &amp; Capt.</hi> For in every Aſſiſe there are four Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
to the Sheriffe. 1. <hi>Facere tenementum eſſe in pace,</hi> to quiet the
poſſeſſion. 2. <hi>Facere recognitionem,</hi> or <hi>Recognit. videre tentam. 3. Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moneas.
4. Ponas eos per vadios, &amp;c.</hi> For which cauſe of neceſſity it
muſt be meant an Aſſiſe <hi>per Breve.</hi> The third Exception was, becauſe
in the Writ it was not ſhewed who was Plaintiffe, and who Defendant.
<hi>Dodderidge.</hi> It is generally to be agreed, That the Writ of Error ought
to agree with the Record: which Rule is taken in 3 <hi>H. 6. 26. C. 3. par.</hi>
the Marqueſs of <hi>Wincbeſters</hi> Caſe. But yet every Variance doth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
this VVrit: For if the variance be only in matter of circumſtance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
as it is in this Caſe, the VVrit ſhall not abate. <hi>vid. 9 H.</hi> 6. 4. 4 &amp; 5 <hi>Phil.
&amp; Ma. Dyer 164. 2 Eliz. Dyer</hi> 173. &amp; 180. 28 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 11. &amp; 12.
The fourth Exception was, becauſe it doth not ſhew the place of the
Caption of this Aſſiſe, but ſayes generall <hi>in Com. Norfolk. Haughton</hi>
held that rather to be examinable in the Parliament then here. The laſt
Exception was, becauſe the VVrit is directed to <hi>Cook</hi> Chief Juſtice, that
he certifie the Record <hi>ſub ſigillo ſuo:</hi> whereas it was ſaid the Record it
ſelf was to come in Parliament, and there a Tranſcript thereof is to be
made, and the Record to be remanded. <hi>V. 22 E. 3. 23 Eliz. Dyer 357.
1 H.</hi> 7. 29. againſt the Book of Entries 302. To which it was anſwered,
That it is at the pleaſure of the Parliament to have either the one or the
other, 22 <hi>E. 3. 3. 8 H.</hi> 5. Error 88. To which <hi>Cook</hi> agreed. And note,
that upon this VVrit of Error a <hi>Superſedeas</hi> was fraudulently procured,
and a VVrit of Attachment iſſued forth againſt <hi>Bacon</hi> who procured it;
And the <hi>Superſedeas</hi> was diſallowed, becauſe that another <hi>Superſedeas</hi>
was granted in the firſt VVrit of Error, And a man can have but one
<hi>Superſedeas.</hi> But the Queſtion in this Caſe was, Admitting that the
VVrit of Error be good and not abateable, If the ſame be a <hi>Superſedeas</hi>
in it ſelf? And the Court doubted of that point: For <hi>Cook</hi> Chief Juſtice
ſaid, That he had viewed 26 or 27 VVrits of Error which were brought
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:40982:125"/>
in Parliament, where the firſt Judgment was diſaffirmed, and but one
where the Judgment was affirmed; and that is in 23 <hi>Eliz. Dyer</hi> 357.
the Record of which cannot be found: <hi>Et quod in praxi eſt inuſitatum, in
jure eſt ſuſpectum.</hi> The Books where Error was brought in Parliament
are 2 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 34 &amp; 40 in the old print. 22 <hi>E. 3. 3. 42 Aſſ. pl. 22. 9 H. 5. 23.
1 H. 7. 29. 23 Eliz. Dyer</hi> 375. And it ſhould be miſchievous for delay,
for a Parliament is only to be ſummoned at the Kings pleaſure. <hi>Haughton,
Dodderidge</hi> and <hi>Crook</hi> held cleerly, That this VVrit of Error was a <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſedeas</hi>
in it ſelf, and that upon the Book of 8 <hi>E.</hi> 2. Error 88. &amp;
<hi>1 H.</hi> 7. 19. where it is ſaid, That the Juſtices did proceed to Execution
after the Judgment affirmed in Parliament, and therefore <hi>ex conſequente
ſequitur</hi> not before: And therefore the VVrit of Error is a <hi>Superſedeas</hi>
that they cannot proceed. But there is no Preſident of it in the Regiſter,
but a <hi>Scire facias, fo.</hi> 70. And the Court held, That if a <hi>Superſedeas</hi> be
once granted and determined in default of the party himſelf, that he ſhall
never have another <hi>Superſedeas:</hi> but otherwiſe if it fail by not coming
of the Juſtices. Alſo <hi>Cook</hi> Chief Juſtice held, That by this VVrit of
Error in Parliament Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Heydon</hi> could not have the effect of
his ſuit, becauſe it is to reverſe a Judgment <hi>coram Rege,</hi> and ſo the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
given in the Common-Pleas ſtands firm, and Sir <hi>Chriſtopher
Heydon</hi> is put to a new VVrit of Error in this Court: for the Judgment
in the Kings Bench is, <hi>Judicium affirmetur, &amp; ſtet in pleno robore &amp; ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectu:</hi>
And it is not as the Judgment is in 20 <hi>E. 4 44. Judicium ſtet in
aeternum.</hi> And ſo that not being the fundamental Judgment, the Reverſal
thereof is but the beginning of another ſuit, 38 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 3. And admit that
the VVrit of Error be a <hi>Superſedeas</hi> for the ſecond Judgment, yet it is a
Queſtion whether it ſhall be for the firſt which is not touched by the
VVrit: And whether they may grant Execution upon it or not. <hi>Vide
13 E. 4. 4: 43 E. 3. 3. 8 H.</hi> 7. 20. And therefore the Court adviſed Sir
<hi>Chriſtopher Heydon</hi> to ſue unto the Kings Majeſty by Petition to have a
new Writ of Error, for without Petition he cannot have the Writ,
<hi>32 E. 3 1. 8 E</hi> 2. Error 88. And the Juſtices gave him warning to do it
in time convenient, otherwiſe they would award Execution if they did
perceive the ſame to be meerly for delay, according to the Caſes in 6 <hi>H</hi> 7.

351. The CLOTHWORKERS of IPSWICH Caſe.</head>
            <p>THe Maſters and Wardens of the Clothworkers of <hi>Ipſwich</hi> in the
County of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> brought an Action of Debt for 3<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="sup">d</hi>.
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:40982:126"/>
againſt <hi>D.</hi> and declared, That the King who now is had incorporated
them by the ſame name, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And had granted unto them by Charter,
<hi>Quod nullus exerceat artem ſive occupationem in aliqua ſhoppa, domo ſive
camera infra villam predict.</hi> of a Clothworker or Tailor, <hi>niſi ante eos vel
duos eorum probationem faceret quod Apprentic. fuit per ſpacium 7 an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum,
&amp; per eos ſive duos eorum ſit approbat. ſub paena</hi> 3<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="sup">d</hi>.
<hi>pro qualibet ſeptimana qua exerceat predict. artem contra hanc conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem.</hi>
And layed <hi>in facto,</hi> That the Defendant had uſed the Trade of
a Tailor for the ſpace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> againſt <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Defendant pleaded, That
he was retained in ſervice with one Mr. <hi>Pennel</hi> Gen: of <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> and had
been an Apprentice for the ſpace of ſeven years <hi>in tali loco, &amp;c.</hi> And that
he made garments for his ſaid Maſter and his wife and their children,
<hi>infra &amp;c. quae quidem exercitio eſt eadem exercitio artis</hi> which is ſuppoſed
by the Plaintiffs in their Declaration. Upon which the Plaintiffs did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur
in Law. <hi>Goldſmith</hi> for the Plaintiffs, That the Plea in Bar is void:
For every Plea in Bar ought to confeſſe and avoid, traverſe or deny that
which is alleadged in the Plaintiffs Declaration: But this Plea in Bar had
not done any of them, and therefore was void: For the exerciſing of the
Trade which he hath confeſſed in his Bar, cannot be intended the ſame
matter with which the Plaintiffs have charged him in their Declaration,
and therefore it is no good bar at all: And to prove the ſame, <hi>vide
14 H. 6. 2. 35 H. 6. 53. 12 H. 7. 24. 27 H.</hi> 8. 2. Sir <hi>Robert Hitcham</hi> for
the Defendant: And he held that the matter is well confeſſed and
avoided; becauſe that uſage which he hath confeſſed in the Bar is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourable
the ſame uſage with which the Plaintiffs have charged him in
their Declaration. As in a Writ of Maintenance, the Defendant ſaith
That he was of Councel with the party, being a Serjeant at Law, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
which is the ſame Maintenance which is ſuppoſed by the Plaintiffe:
<hi>vide 28 H.</hi> 6. 7. &amp; 12. 19 <hi>H. 6. 30. 18 E. 4. 2. 36 H.</hi> 6. 7. Alſo he ſaid,
When a Declaration is general, the Defendant need not traverſe, 1 <hi>E. 4.
9. 2 E.</hi> 4. 28. And further he ſaid, That the Statute of 27 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 5.
of Demurs helped that defect, for that it is but only in matter of form.
But the Juſtices did not argue that point: But the Queſtion which they
made was, Whether the Conſtitution or Ordinance were lawful or not:
And as to that it was holden by the whole Court, That the ſaid Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
was unlawful: And it was agreed by the Court, That the King
might make Corporations, and grant to them that they may make Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
for the ordering and government of any Trade; but thereby
they cannot make a Monopoly, for that is to take away Free-trade, which
is the birthright of every Subject. And therefore the Caſe was in 2 <hi>H.
5.</hi> 5. in Debt upon a Bond upon Condition, That one ſhould not uſe his
Trade of a Dyer in the Town where the Plaintiffe did inhabit for one
year: And there ſaid, That the Obligation was void, becauſe the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
was againſt the Law; And he ſwore (by God) if the Plaintiffe
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:40982:127"/>
were preſent, that he ſhould go to priſon till he had paid a Fine to the
King: Yet regularly, <hi>Modus &amp; Conventio vincunt legem.</hi> 2. It was
reſolved, That although ſuch Clauſe was contained in the Kings Letters
Patents, yet it was void: But where it is either by Preſcription or by
Cuſtome confirmed by Parliament, there ſuch an Ordinance may be
good; <hi>Quia Conſuetudo Legalis plus valet quam Conceſſio Regalis.</hi> The
King granted unto the Abbot of <hi>Whitny</hi> the Cuſtody of a Port which
is as it were a Key of the Kingdom; and therefore the Grant was void
and ſo adjudged: And ſuch Grants are expreſly againſt the Statute of
<hi>9 E 3. cap.</hi> 1. And the Charter granted by King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. to the
Phyſitians of <hi>London</hi> hath the ſame Clauſe in it: But if it had not been
confirmed by Act of Parliament made 33 <hi>H.</hi> 8. it had been void. The
King granted unto <hi>B.</hi> that none beſides himſelf ſhould make Ordnances
for Battery in the time of war: Such Grant was adjudged void. But
if a man hath brought in a new Invention and a new Trade within the
Kingdom, in peril of his life, and conſumption of his eſtate or ſtock, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
or if a man hath made a new Diſcovery of any thing, In ſuch Caſes the
King of his grace and favour, in recompence of his coſts and travail, may
grant by Charter unto him, That he only ſhall uſe ſuch a Trade or Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique
for a certain time, becauſe at firſt the people of the Kingdom are
ignorant, and have not the knowledge or skill to uſe it: But when that
Patent is expired, the King cannot make a new Grant thereof: For
when the Trade is become common, and others have been bound Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices
in the ſame Trade, there is no reaſon that ſuch ſhould be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
to uſe it. And <hi>Cook</hi> Chief Juſtice put this Caſe: The King
granted to <hi>B.</hi> That he ſolely ſhould make and carry Kerſies out of the
Realm; and the Grant was adjudged void, which <hi>Crook conceſſit.
3.</hi> It was reſolved, That this Charter was void, becauſe of the words, <hi>viz.
Niſi ante eos vel duos eorum probationem fecerit, &amp;c.</hi> And therefore it
was conſidered what proof ſhould be ſufficient for the party: And as to
that it was agreed, That the proof cannot be upon Oath; for ſuch a
Corporation cannot admidiſter an Oath unto the party: And then the
proof muſt be by his Indentures and Witneſſes; and perhaps the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration
will not allow of any of them: For which the party hath no
remedy againſt the ſaid Corporation, but by his Action at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Law; and in the mean time he ſhould be barred of his Trade which
is all his living and maintenance, and to which he had been Apprentice
for ſeven years. Another reaſon was given, becauſe that by this way they
ſhould be Judges in their own cauſe, which is againſt the Law: And
the King cannot grant unto another to do a thing which is againſt the
Law. And afterwards <hi>Trin. 12 Jacobi,</hi> Judgment was entred, <hi>Quod
Querentes nihil capiant per Billam.</hi> And Judgment was then given for
the Defendant.</p>

352. LINSEY and ASHTON's Caſe.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>LInſey</hi> brought an Action of Debt againſt <hi>Aſhton</hi> upon a Bond, the
Condition of which was to perform an Award. The Defendant
ſaid that the Award was, That the Defendant ſhould ſurceaſe all ſuits
depending betwixt them, which he had done: The Plaintiffe in his
Replication ſaid, That the Arbitrators made ſuch Award <hi>ut ſupra,</hi>
and alſo that the Defendant ſhould pay unto the Plaintiffe 25<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. at
the houſe of <hi>J. S. abſque hoc,</hi> that they made the other Award only.
Upon which the Defendant did rejoyn and ſaid, That well and true it is
that they made thoſe Awards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But they further awarded that the
Plaintiffe ſhould releaſe unto the Defendant, which he had not done.
And upon the Rejoynder the Plaintiffe did demur in Law. And the
opinion of the Court was without queſtion, That the Plea was a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture,
<hi>19 H.</hi> 6. 19. But it was argued by <hi>Finch,</hi> That the Replication
was inſufficient: For the Plaintiffe ought not to have traverſed, as this
Caſe is, becauſe that a man ought not to traverſe a thing alleadged by
Implication, but ought to traverſe that which is alleadged <hi>de facto,</hi> upon
which there may be an iſſue joyned. And to prove the Traverſe void,
the Caſe in 11 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 50. was put: But the Exception was not allowed by
the Court. Another Exception was taken, becauſe the Award it ſelf
was void, becauſe it was to do a thing upon the Land of another man,
which he might not lawfully do: And although the Arbitrators might
award him to do the thing which is inconvenient, yet they cannot
award him to do a thing which is impoſſible and againſt the Law: as in
<hi>17 E.</hi> 4, 5. Two were bound to ſtand to the Arbitrement of <hi>J. S.</hi> of all
Treſpaſſes; who awarded that the one ſhould pay unto the other 40.
and that he find Sureties to be bounden for the payment of it. And by
the opinion of the Juſtices the Award was void, becauſe he could not
award a man to do that which did not lie in his power, and he hath no
means to compel the ſtranger to be bound for him. But the opinion of
the whole Court was againſt <hi>Finch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> For firſt, the mony is to be paid <hi>apud
domum J. S.</hi> and not <hi>in domo;</hi> And it might be, for any thing that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth,
that the ſaid Houſe is adjoyning to the High-way, ſo as every
Stranger might lawfully come unto it, although he might not come into
it without being a Treſpaſſor: But admit it be not adjoyning to the
High-way, yet he might come as neer unto the houſe as he could, or he
might get leave to come thither. Secondly, It was reſolved, That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:40982:128"/>
the Award was void as to that part, yet for the reſidue it ſtood
good, and therefore for not performance of the ſame the Bond is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited.
As if <hi>J.</hi> be bounden to perform the Award of <hi>J. S.</hi> for White-Acre,
and that he award that I enfeoffe another of White-Acre, and
that he give unto me Ten pounds: If I tender unto him a Feoffment of
White-Acre, and he refuſeth it, and will not give to me the 10<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. I ſhall
have an Action of Debt upon the Bond, as it is adjudged in <hi>Osborn's</hi> Caſe
<hi>C. 10. par.</hi> 131. The ſame Law, If <hi>J. S.</hi> and <hi>J. N.</hi> ſubmit themſelves unto
the Award of <hi>J. D.</hi> who awardeth that <hi>J. S.</hi> ſhall ſurceaſe all ſuits, and
procure <hi>J. N.</hi> to be bounden with a ſtranger, and make a Feoffment of
his Mannor of <hi>D.</hi> which is a thing out of the Submiſſion: In that caſe
there are three things enforcing the Arbitrement; the firſt is only good,
the ſecond is againſt the Law, and the other is out of the Submiſſion:
yet being in part good, it ought to be performed in that, otherwiſe the
Bond is forfeited. But this Caſe was put: If <hi>J.</hi> be bounden to ſtand
to the Award of <hi>A. ita quod</hi> it be made <hi>de &amp; ſuper premiſſis,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
<hi>A.</hi> maketh an Award but of part of the premiſes, there it is void
in all, becauſe it is not according to the authority given unto him. And
afterwards in the principal Caſe Judgment was given for the Plaintiffe.</p>

355. COWLEY and LEGAT's Caſe.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>COwley</hi> brought an <hi>Audita quaerela</hi> againſt <hi>Legat,</hi> and the Caſe was
this: <hi>Cowley</hi> and <hi>Bates</hi> bound themſelves in a Bond of 200<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. jointly
and ſeverally to <hi>Legat;</hi> And afterwards 6 <hi>Jacobi, Legat</hi> brought an
action of Debt upon the Bond againſt <hi>Bates,</hi> and had Judgment; and
<hi>7 Jacobi</hi> the ſaid <hi>Legat</hi> brought Debt againſt <hi>Cowley</hi> in the Kings Bench
upon the ſame Bond, and obtained Judgment; and afterwards he ſued
forth Execution upon the firſt Judgment by <hi>Elegit,</hi> and had the Land of
<hi>Bates,</hi> who was Tenant thereof only for another mans life, in Execution;
and afterwards he took forth a <hi>Capias ad ſatisfaciendum</hi> againſt <hi>Cowley</hi>
upon the Judgment in the Kings Bench: And thereupon <hi>Cowley</hi> brought
an <hi>Audita quaerela,</hi> containing in it all the whole matter. And the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of all the Juſtices was, That the <hi>Audita quaerela</hi> was well brought.
And firſt it was holden, That when a man may plead the matter in bar,
he ſhall not have an <hi>Audita quaerela</hi> upon the matter, becauſe it was his
lacheſs that he did not take advantage of it by way of plea. But ſecondly
in this Caſe it was ſaid, That he could not have pleaded the ſpecial
matter; and therefore as to that point the <hi>Audita quaerela</hi> was well
brought. But the onely doubt in the Caſe was, Whether <hi>Legat</hi> the
Defendant might have a new Execution by <hi>Capias ad ſatisfaciendum,</hi>
after that he had Execution againſt one of the Obligers by <hi>Elegit:</hi> and
the doubt was, becauſe the Judgments upon which he grounded his
Executions were given at ſeveral times, and in ſeveral Courts, and againſt
ſeveral perſons: For it was agreed by the whole Court, That a <hi>Capias</hi>
doth not lie after Execution ſued by <hi>Elegit</hi> againſt the ſame perſon; but
after a <hi>Capias</hi> an <hi>Elegit</hi> is grantable: And the reaſon of the difference
is, becauſe upon the prayer to have an <hi>Elegit,</hi> it is entred in the Roll,
<hi>Elegit ſibi executionem per medietatem terrae,</hi> ſo as he is eſtopped by the
Record to have another Execution; but upon a <hi>Capias</hi> nothing at all
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:40982:129"/>
is entred upon Record. Yet <hi>Cook</hi> Chief Juſtice ſaid, That it is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
practice of a good Attorney to deferre the entry in the Roll of
Execution upon an <hi>Elegit,</hi> until the Sheriffe hath retorned it ſerved:
And in ſuch caſe it was agreed, That if the Sheriffe retorn upon the
<hi>Elegit,</hi> That the party hath not Lands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then the party may take forth
a <hi>Capias.</hi> Alſo the <hi>Elegit</hi> is in it ſelf a ſatisfactory Execution; and by
the Common-Law a man ſhall have but one Execution with ſatisfaction.
And therefore at the Common-Law, if after Execution the Land had
been evicted, the party had no remedy: And <hi>Cook</hi> ſaid, If part of the
Land be evicted, the party ſhall not have remedy upon the Statute
of 32 <hi>H. 8. cap.</hi> 5. to which <hi>Crook</hi> Juſtice agreed. And the Court held it
to be no difference, although that the Judgments were given in ſeveral
Courts againſt perſons ſeveral, and at ſeveral times, and where it is but
one Judgment againſt one perſon. <hi>Vide</hi> the Caſe 43 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 27. where in
Debt the Defendant ſaid, That the Plaintiffe had another Action for the
ſame Debt depending in the Exchequer by Bill, Judgment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And by
<hi>Mowbray</hi> and <hi>Finchden</hi> cleerly it is a good plea, although it be in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Court: And <hi>Dodderidge</hi> Juſtice ſaid, That in the firſt caſe the
ſaid <hi>Legat</hi> might ſue the ſaid <hi>Cowley</hi> and <hi>Bates</hi> ſeverally, and after
Judgment he might chooſe his Execution againſt which of them he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed:
But he could not have Execution by <hi>Elegit</hi> againſt them both.
And therefore he ſaid, That although there be an Eviction of the Land,
or that the Judgment be reverſed by Error after that he hath Execution
againſt one by <hi>Elegit,</hi> yet <hi>Legat</hi> could not have Execution againſt the
other: for by the firſt Execution he had determined his Election, and
he could not ſue the other: which <hi>Cook</hi> agreed.</p>

of their Eccleſiaſtical houſes; and do or ſuffer to be done

358. PRAT and the Lord NORTH'S Caſe.</head>
            <p>A Man was diſtreined by the Bailiffe of the Lord <hi>North,</hi> for 20<hi rend="sup">s</hi>.
impoſed upon him in the Court-Leet for the erecting and ſtoring
of a Dove-Cote: And it was ſaid, That it cannot properly be called a
Nuſance, but for the deſtroying of Corn, which cannot be but at certain
times of the year: And therefore it was conceived, That the party who
was preſented might traverſe the Nuſance to be with his Pidgeons; and
it was ſaid that a man might keep Pidgeons within his new houſe all the
year, or put them out at ſuch a time as they could not deſtroy the corn:
And <hi>Cook</hi> Chief Juſtice ſaid, That there is not any reaſon that the Lord
ſhould have a Dove-Cote more then the Tenant; and he asked the
Queſtion, where the Statute of <hi>E.</hi> 2. ſaith, <hi>Inquiratur de</hi> Dove-Cotes
erected without Licence, Who ſhould give the Licence? <hi>Ad quod non
fuit reſponſum.</hi> In <hi>Mich.</hi> Term following the Caſe was argued by <hi>Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,</hi>
who ſaid, That the erecting of a Dove-Cote by a Freeholder was
no Nuſance: For a Writ of Right lieth of a Dove-Cote, and in the
Regiſter it is preferred and named before Land, Garden, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But he
ſaid that there was a fatal defect in the Plea: which was, That the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment
at the Leet was. That <hi>Prat</hi> had erected a Dove-Cote unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
and did not ſay <hi>ad commune nocumentum,</hi> as it ought to be, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
it is not preſentable in the Leet: And therefore although it was

359. GREENWAY and BARKER's Caſe.</head>
            <p>BEtwixt <hi>Greenway</hi> and <hi>Barker,</hi> It was moved for a Prohibition to the
Court of Admiralty; and the Cauſe was for taking of a Recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance
in which the Principal and his Sureties, his heirs, goods and lands
were bounden: And it was in the nature of an Execution at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and thereupon they in the Admiral Court made out a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
to arreſt the body of the Defendant there. <hi>Dodderidge</hi> Serjeant ſaid,
That it was not a Recogniſance at the Common-Law, but only a Stipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
in the nature of a Bail at the Common-Law; and he ſaid, That it
was the uſual courſe to pledge goods there in Court to anſwer the party
if ſentence were given againſt him. <hi>Nichols</hi> Serjeant: They cannot
take a Recogniſance; and by the Civil Law, if the party render his body
the Sureties are diſcharged; and Execution ought to be only of the goods,
for the ſhip is only arreſted; and the Libel ought to be only againſt the
ſhip and goods and not againſt the party, 19 <hi>H. 6. acc'.</hi> And afterwards
Dr. <hi>Steward</hi> and Dr. <hi>James</hi> were deſired by the Court to deliver their
opinions what the Civil Law was in this Caſe: and Doctor <hi>Steward</hi>
ſaid, He would not reſt upon the Etymologie of the word; for if it be
a Recogniſance, Bail, or Stipulation, it is all one in the Civil Law; and
in ſuch caſe he ſaid by their Law Execution might be againſt the ſureties.
And he argued, 1. That <hi>ex neceſſitate</hi> it muſt be agreed that there is an
Admiral Court. 2. That that Court hath a Juriſdiction: And by a
Statute made in <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. time, and by another in the time of Queen
<hi>Elizabeth,</hi> divers things as Appeals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were triable by the Civil Law.
And he ſaid, That every Court hath his ſeveral form of proceedings;
and in every Court that form is to be followed which it hath antiently
uſed: And as to the proceedings he ſaid, That firſt they do arreſt the
goods; 2. That afterwards the party ought to enter Caution, which is
not a Bond, but only a Surety or Security, which doth bind the parties.
And he ſaid, That the word <hi>Haeredes</hi> was neceſſary in the Inſtrument,
For for the moſt part the Sureties were ſtrangers: And he ſaid, That
Court took no notice of the word <hi>(Executors)</hi> and therefore the word
<hi>Haeredes</hi> is uſed, which extends as well to Executors and Adminiſtrators
as to Heirs: And he ſaid, That upon a Judgment given in the Court of
Admiraltie, they may ſue forth an Execution of it in forein parts, as in
<hi>France, &amp;c.</hi> And he ſaid, That if Contracts be made according to other
Laws, the ſame muſt be tryed according to the Law of that Country
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:40982:130"/>
the Contract is made. Dr. <hi>James</hi> ſaid, That in the ſame Court there are
two manners of proceedings; 1 The Manner, 2 the Cuſtoms of the Court
are to be obſerved. And he ſaid, that Stipulation ought to be in the Court
by coertion, which word is derived <hi>(à ſtipite)</hi> by which the party is tyed
(as he ſaid) as a Bear to the ſtake, or as <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>liſſes</hi> to the Maſt of the ſhip.
And he ſaid, In a Judicial ſtipulation four things are conſiderable:
1 The Judicial Siſtem; 2. <hi>Reparratum habere; 3. Judicatum ſolvere;
4. De expenſis ſolvendis,</hi> as appeareth in <hi>Juſtinians</hi> Inſtitutes <hi>cap de Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dationibus:</hi>
For <hi>Satisdatio</hi> and <hi>Stipulatio</hi> are all one in the Civil Law.
And after <hi>Cook</hi> Chief Juſtice ſaid, That it ought to be confeſſed that
there hath been a Court of Admiralty; 2. That their proceedings there
ought to be according to the Civil Law. And he obſerved four things,
1. The Neceſſity of the Court, 2. The Antiquity of it, 3. The Law by
which they proceed, and laſtly the Place to which they are confined.
And as to the neceſſity of the Court he ſaid, That the Juriſdiction of
that Court ought to be maintained by reaſon of Trade and Traffique
betwixt Kingdom and Kingdom; for Trade and Traffique is as it were
the life of every Kingdom. 2. A mans life is in danger by reaſon of traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique,
and Merchants venture all their eſtates; and therefore it is but
reaſonable that they have a place for the trial of Contracts made upon
the Sea by them or their Factors. And for the Antiquity of the Court,
<hi>v. t' E. 1. ſitz. t' Annuity. 7 R. 2. t' treſpas in Statham.</hi> And ſo long as
there hath been any Commerce and Traffique by this Kingdom, ſo long
there hath been a Court of Admiralty. 3. He ſaid, The Court of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty
is no Court of Record in which a Writ of Error lieth, 37 <hi>H. 6. acc'.</hi>
4. He conſidered the place: And that he ſaid was of things <hi>ſuper altum
mare</hi> only, as appeareth by the Stat. of 13 <hi>R.</hi> 2. And he ſaid, That all the
Ports and Havens within <hi>England</hi> are <hi>infra corpus Comitatus;</hi> and vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>23 H. 6. &amp; 30 H. 6. Hollands</hi> Caſe, who was Earl of <hi>Exeter</hi> and
Admiral of <hi>England:</hi> who becauſe he held plea in the Court of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty
of a thing done <hi>infra Portam de Hull,</hi> damages were recovered
againſt him of 2000l. And he ſaid, That if the Court and Civil Law
be allowed, then he ſaid the Cuſtoms of that Court ought to be allowed;
and he ſaid, That the Cuſtome of the Civil Law is, That in no caſe the
Surety is chargeable, when the Principal is ſufficient: And he agreed
with the Doctors, That the word <hi>Haeredes</hi> ought to be in the Stipulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
becauſe thoſe beyond the Seas did not take any cogniſance of the
word <hi>Executors.</hi> Alſo he ſaid, That they may take the body in Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which are for the moſt part the Maſters of the ſhips and Merchants,
who are <hi>tranſeuntes,</hi> and therefore if they could not arreſt their bodies
they might perhaps many times loſe the benefit of their ſuits. But he ſaid
that in no caſe they might take forth Execution upon Lands. And he
ſaid, That if a Contract be made in <hi>Paris</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> it ſhall be tryed ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the Common Law, or by the Law of <hi>France:</hi> and if it be tryed
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:40982:131"/>
here, then thoſe of <hi>France</hi> ſhall write to the Juſtices of <hi>England,</hi> and ſhall
certifie the ſame unto them. And he ſaid, That in Sir <hi>Robert Dudley's</hi>
Caſe it was allowed for good Law; where a Fine was levied and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
in <hi>Orleance</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> which was certified and allowed for
good by the Common Law here in <hi>England:</hi> But he ſaid, That the Civil
Law could not determine of the Fine. And to conclude, he ſaid, That no
Cuſtome can be good which is againſt an Act of Parliament. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Caſe was adjourned.</p>

            <p>A Man brought an Action of Debt as Adminiſtrator, and took the
Defendants body in Execution. The Sheriffe ſuffered him to eſcape.
And afterwards a Will was found, by which Will the ſaid Adminiſtrator
is nominated Executor. The Queſtion now was, Whether he might
maintain an Action againſt the Sheriffe for the Eſcape as Executor when
he was but Adminiſtrator at the time: and it was the opinion of the Court
that the action of Debt againſt the Sheriff upon the Eſcape would lie, and
that the ſame Debt ſhould be aſſets in the Executors hands. And it was
holden cleer, That the Executor of an Executor might have Debt upon
the Eſcape, for that he is Executor to the firſt Teſtator; and therefore
<hi>à fortiori</hi> the Action in the principal Caſe would lie.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>JOhn Owen</hi> alias <hi>Collins</hi> of <hi>Godſtow</hi> in the County of <hi>Oxford,</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
and arraigned of High-Treaſon, for ſpeaking theſe traiterous
Engliſh words at <hi>Sandwich</hi> in the County of <hi>Kent, viz. If the King be
excommunicate by the Pope, it is lawfull for every man to kill him, and it is
no murder: For as it is lawfull to put to death a man that is condemned by
a Temporal Judge, ſo it is lawfull to kill the King if he be excommunicate
by the Pope: For that is the execution of the Law, and this of the Popes ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
ſentence; The Pope being the greater, includes the King being the
leſſer.</hi> To which words he pleaded Not guilty. And the Evidence to
the Jury was, the Major of <hi>Sandwich,</hi> a Parſon of the ſame Town, and
the Servant of the Town-Clark. And this was the ſum of the Evidence,
That the ſaid <hi>Owen</hi> coming from S. <hi>Lucar</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> ſpake the ſaid words
to divers perſons, who told them to the Major: whereupon the ſaid
Major had conference with <hi>Owen,</hi> and then he ſpake the like words unto
the Major; and thereupon the Major tendred unto him the Oath of
Allegiance, which he refuſed to take, and he put his hand to awriting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the ſaid words as his opinion; and further ſaid, That if he had
twenty hands he would put them all to it. The Exception which <hi>Owen</hi>
took unto the Evidence given againſt him was, That he did not ſpeak of
the King of <hi>England</hi> But the ſame was ſaid to be a ſimple Exception:
For before he ſpake the words to the Major, the Major asked him if he
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:40982:132"/>
were an Engliſhman, or not? To which he anſwered, that he was; and
then after, he ſpake the ſaid words to the Major, which muſt neceſſarily
have reference to the ſpeeches which were before betwixt him and the
Major. And <hi>Cook</hi> Chief Juſtice ſaid, That if he had not ſpoken of the
King of <hi>England,</hi> but of the King generally, yet it had included the
King of <hi>England.</hi> The matter of his Indictment of Treaſon was not
grounded upon the Statute of Supremacie, but upon the Common-Law,
of which the Statute of 25 <hi>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nation; which was, his
intent to compaſs the death of the King. And he ſaid, That notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
that the words as to this purpoſe were but conditional, viz. <hi>If
he were Excommunicate,</hi> yet (he ſaid) it was High-Treaſon. For proof
of which two Caſes were cited. The Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> in the time
of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. ſaid, That if the King ſhould arreſt him of High-Treaſon,
that he would ſtab him with his dagger: and it was adjudged
a preſent Treaſon. So was it alſo adjudged in the Lord <hi>Stanley's</hi> Caſe,
in the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 7. who ſeeing a Young-man, ſaid, That if
he knew him to be one of the Sons of <hi>E.</hi> 4. that he would aid him againſt
the King. In the like manner a woman in the time of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. ſaid, That
if <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. would not take again his wife Queen <hi>Katherine,</hi> that he
ſhould not live a year, but ſhould die like a dog. So if diſcontented per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
with Incloſures ſay, That they will petition unto the King about
them, and (if) he will not redreſs the ſame, that then they will aſſemble
together in ſuch a place and rebell: In theſe Caſes it is a preſent Treaſon:
and he ſaid, That in point of Allegiance none muſt ſerve the King with
<hi>Ifs</hi> and <hi>Ands.</hi> Further <hi>Cook</hi> Chief Juſtice ſaid, That <hi>Faux</hi> the Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder
Traitor being brought before King <hi>James,</hi> the King ſaid to him,
<hi>Wherefore would you have killed me? Faux</hi> anſwered him, viz. <hi>Becauſe
you are excommunicated by the Pope. How?</hi> ſaid the King. He anſwered,
<hi>Every Maunday-Thurſday the Pope doth excommunicate all Her<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>RIchard Simpſon</hi> a Copy-holder in Fee, <hi>jacens in extremis,</hi> made a

into the Land, againſt whom <hi>John Simpſon</hi> brought an Action of

were reſolved in this Caſe. 1. That a Surrender cannot begin at a day to

in <hi>Clarks</hi> Caſe. 2. That the Remaindor to <hi>John Simpſon</hi> cannot be
good, becauſe it was to commence upon a Condition precedent, which
was never performed: And therefore the Surrender into the hands of
the Lord was void; for the Lord doth not take but as an Inſtrument to
convey the ſame to another. And it was therefore ſaid, That if a Copy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder

that the Limitation of the uſe is void to him who had it before, the

for the Plaintiffe, That the failing of certain alleadging of the Requeſt
in the Declaration made the ſame inſufficient. And ſo it was adjudged
by the Court with this difference, where it was a duty in the Plaintiffe
before, and where the Requeſt makes it a duty: For in the firſt caſe the
Plaintiffe need not alleadge the Requeſt preciſely, but otherwiſe in the

there the day and place of the requeſt ought to be alleadged in the

<hi>viz.</hi> That the finding of the Jury made the Declaration which was
vitious to be good: As if Executors plead, That they have nothing in
their hands the day of the Action brought, it is inſufficient; But if the
Jury find Aſſets it is good, and ſo by conſequence the Verdict ſhall ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the defect of Pleading. But the Court held theſe books to be good
Law, and not to be contrary, and well reconciled with this difference:
For there the Plea was naught only in matter of circumſtance; but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
it is where it is vitious in ſubſtance, as in this caſe it is. And a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
alſo was taken where the Verdict doth perfect all which is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial

<hi>Dodderidge</hi> Juſtice cited 5 <hi>E.</hi> 4. That if the Declaration be vitious in a
point material, and iſſue is taken upon another point, there the finding
of it by the Jury doth not make the Declaration to be good. And ſo in
the principal Caſe Judgment was given for the Defendant. In this Caſe
it was agreed, That if a man bring an Action of Trover and Converſion,

to Sir <hi>John Bret</hi> and <hi>Margaret</hi> his wife. The Aſſignee is accepted
Tenant; the Mill came to decay for want of Reparations, and Sir <hi>John

Leſſee; And it was adjudged for the Plaintiffe. And <hi>Dodderidge</hi> Juſtice
gave the reaſons of the Judgment, 1. Becauſe that by the Statute of <hi>32

the Covenant againſt the Leſſee; For a Mill is a thing which without

the words were, That the Defendant <hi>erexit Columbare vi &amp; armis ad

Rector Eccleſiae.</hi> And the Indictment was quaſhed, becauſe it was not
contained in the Indictment that there were Doves in the Dove-cote:
For the meer erecting of a Dove-cote, if there be no Doves kept in it, it
is no Nuſans, as it was holden by the Juſtices.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>YAte</hi> brought an action upon the Caſe againſt <hi>Alexander</hi> Attorney
of the Kings Bench; and declared, That the Plaintiffe in an action
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:40982:142"/>
of Debt brought againſt <hi>Alexander</hi> the Defendant who was Executor
to his Father, had Judgment to recover againſt him as Executor, and that
he ſued forth a <hi>Fieri facias</hi> to the Sheriffe to have Execution: and that
before the Sheriffe could come to levy the debt and ſerve the Execution,
the Defendant <hi>A ſecretè &amp; fraudulenter vendidit, amovit &amp; diſpoſuit</hi>
of all the Teſtators goods, For which cauſe the Sheriffe was conſtrained
to retorn <hi>Nulla bona, &amp;c. Ley</hi> Chief Juſtice ſaid, That the Action would
well lie, becauſe the Sheriffe could not retorn a <hi>Devaſtavit,</hi> becauſe the
goods were ſecretly conveyed away, ſo as the Sheriffe could not tell
whether he had ſold or otherwiſe diſpoſed of the ſaid goods, and alſo
becauſe the Plaintiffe is deſtitute of all remedy by any other Action.
To which <hi>Dodderidge</hi> Juſtice did agree<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But <hi>Haughton</hi> Juſtice was againſt
it: For he ſaid, That if one be to bring an action of Debt againſt the
Heir, if the Heir ſelleth the Land which he hath by diſcent from his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors
before the action brought, an action upon the Caſe will not lie
againſt him for ſo doing. <hi>Dodderidge</hi> ſaid, That the Caſe which was put
by <hi>Haughton</hi> was not like to this Caſe: For in this Caſe if the Sheriffe
had, or could have retorned a <hi>Devaſtavit,</hi> the action upon the Caſe
would not have lien; But here the Sheriffe hath not retorned any <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſtavit:</hi>
And the ſale being ſecretly made, the Sheriffe could not ſafely
retorn a <hi>Devaſtavit,</hi> for ſo perhaps he might be in danger of an action

<hi>v. Stamford</hi> 23. 6. But now by the Statute of <hi>Weſt. 2. cap.</hi> 34. it is made
Felony: And he ſaid, That the later words, viz. <hi>(ſtand in a white ſheet)</hi>
doth mitigate the former words, by reaſon that in the former words the
word <hi>(Felonice)</hi> was omitted; as the Caſe is in <hi>C. 4. par. 20. Barhams</hi>
Caſe, where the words <hi>Thou didſt burn my Barn,</hi> and did not ſay, My
Barn full of Corn, nor that it was parcel of his Manſion-houſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

adjudged in the Common-Pleas, where an action upon the Caſe was
brought for theſe words, <hi>Thou haſt pick'd my Pocket and taken away ten

Plate, and had been pardoned for it. But notwithſtanding the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,

And then <hi>Hobart</hi> Chief Juſtice of the Common-Pleas cited <hi>Cuddingtons</hi>
Caſe <hi>Hill. 13 Jacobi,</hi> to be adjudged. <hi>Cuddington</hi> brought an action
upon the Caſe for calling him <hi>Thief:</hi> The Defendant juſtified that
ſuch a day and year he ſtole a Horſe: The Plaintiffe replied, That the
King had given him a Pardon for all Felonies: And it was adjudged
that the Action did lie. Afterwards at another day <hi>Jones</hi> and <hi>Dodderidge</hi>
Juſtices put the Caſe more largely, viz. <hi>Cuddington</hi> committed Felony
<hi>44 Eliz.</hi> and 1 <hi>Jacobi</hi> by the General Pardon he was pardoned. And
they ſaid, That he who procures a Pardon, confeſſeth himſelf to be
guilty of the offence: But by the general Pardon it is not known
whether he be guilty or not; and in <hi>Cuddingtons</hi> Caſe it was a general
Pardon, and that was the cauſe that the Action did lie, for that it is not
known whether he committed the Felony or not. But they conceived
that if it had been a particular Pardon, that then in that caſe the Action
would not have been maintainable: For the procuring of a ſpecial Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
doth preſuppoſe, and it is a ſtrong preſumption that the party is
guilty of the offence. Note, it did not appear in the Caſe of <hi>Fines</hi>

416. Sir EDWARD COKE's Caſe.</head>
            <p>THis Caſe being of great conſequence and concernment, The Maſter
of the Court of Wards was aſſiſted by four of the Judges in the
hearing and debating of it: and after many Arguments at the Barr, the
ſaid four Judges argued the ſame in Court, <hi>viz. Dodderidge</hi> one of the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices
of the Kings Bench, <hi>Tanfield</hi> Lord chief Baron of the Exchequer,
<hi>Hobart</hi> Lord Chief Juſtice of the Court of Common Pleas, and <hi>Ley</hi>
Lord Chief Juſtice of his Majeſties Court of Kings Bench: The Caſe
in effect was this: Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> by her Letters Patents did grant
to Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Hatton</hi> the Office of Remembrancer and Collector
of the firſt Fruits for his life, <hi>Habendum</hi> to him after the death or ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
of one <hi>Godfrey</hi> who held the ſaid Office then in poſſeſſion; Sir
<hi>Chriſtopher Hatton</hi> being thus eſtated in the ſaid Office in Reverſion,
and being ſeiſed in Fee-ſimple of diverſe Mannors, Lands and Tenements,
did Covenant to ſtand ſeiſed of his ſaid lands, &amp;c. unto the uſe of himſelf
for life, and afterwards to the uſe of <hi>J. Hatton</hi> his ſon in tail, and ſo to
his other ſons intail; with the Remainder to the right heirs, of
<hi>J. Hatton</hi> in Fee, with <hi>Proviſo</hi> of Revocation at his pleaſure du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his life. <hi>Godfrey</hi> the Officer in poſſeſſion died, and Sir <hi>Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
Hatton</hi> became Officer and was poſſeſſed of the Office, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
he became indebted to the Queen by reaſon of his ſaid Office;
And the Queſtion in this great Caſe was, Whether the Mannors and
Lands which were ſo conveyed and ſetled by Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Hatton,</hi>
might be extended for the ſaid Debt due to the Queen, by reaſon of the
<hi>Proviſo</hi> and Revocation in the ſaid Conveyance of Aſſurance of the ſaid
Mannors and Lands, the debt due to the Queen was aſſign'd over, and the
Lands extended, and the Extent came to Sir <hi>Edward Coke,</hi> and the heir
of <hi>John Hatton</hi> ſued in the Court of Wards to make void the Extent:
And it was agreed by the ſaid four Juſtices, and ſo it was afterwards de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
by <hi>Cranfield</hi> Maſter of the Court of Wards, and the whole
Court, That the ſaid Mannors and Lands were liable to the ſaid
Extent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="290" facs="tcp:40982:145"/>
And <hi>Dodderidge</hi> Juſtice who argued firſt, ſaid that the Kings Majeſtie
had ſundry prerogatives for the Recovery of Debts and other Duties
owing unto him: Firſt he had this prerogative, <hi>ab origine legis,</hi> That he
might have the Lands, the Goods, and the Body of the Perſon his
Debtor in Execution for his Debt. But at the Common Law a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
perſon; a common perſon could not have taken the body of his debtor
in execution for his debt: but the ſame priviledg was given unto him by
the Statute of 25. <hi>E. 3. cap.</hi> 17. At the Common Law he ſaid that a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
perſon Debtee might have had a <hi>Levari facias</hi> for the Recovery
of his Debt, by which Writ the Sheriffe was commanded <hi>Quod de ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris
&amp; Catallis ipſius,</hi> the Debtor, &amp;c. <hi>Levari faciat, &amp;c.</hi> but in ſuch
Caſe the Debtee did not meddle with the Land, but the Sheriffe did col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
the Debt and pay the ſame over to the Debtor: But by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of <hi>Weſt. 2. cap</hi> 20. The Debtee might have an <hi>Elegit,</hi> and ſo have
the moyetie of the Lands of his Debtor in Execution for his
Debt, as it appeareth in <hi>C. 3. part.</hi> 12. in Sir <hi>William Harberts</hi>
Caſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He ſaid, That the King had another prerogative, and that
was, to have his Debt paid before the Debt of any Subject, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
<hi>41. E. 3. Execution</hi> 38. and <hi>Paſc. 3. Elizabeth. Dyer.</hi> 197. in
the Lord <hi>Dacres</hi> and <hi>Laſſels</hi> Caſe, and in <hi>M. 3. E. 6. Dyer, 67, String<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellows</hi>
Caſe; For there the Sheriffe was amerced, becauſe the King
ought to have his Debt firſt paid, and ought to be preferred before a
Subject <hi>vid. 328 Dyer,</hi> There the words of the Writ of Priviledg ſhew
that the King is to be preferred before other Creditors: By the Statute
of 33. <hi>H. 8. cap.</hi> 39. The Execution of the Subject ſhall be firſt ſerved,
if his Judgment be before any Proceſſe be awarded for the Kings debt.
In the Statute of 25. <hi>E. 3. Cap.</hi> 19. I find that by the Common Law,
the King might grant a Protection to his Debtor that no other might
ſue him before that the King was ſatisfied his debt. See the Writ of
Protection, <hi>Regiſter <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 81. B.</hi> the words of which are, <hi>Et quia nolumus
ſolutionem debitorum noſtrorum caeteris omnibus prout ratione Perogativae
noſtrae totis temporibus retroactis uſitatae, &amp;c.</hi> But that grew ſuch a Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
to the Subject, that the Statute of 25. <hi>E. 3. Cap.</hi> 19. was made.
And now by that Statute a common perſon may lawfully ſue to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but he cannot proceed to Execution (and ſo the Kings Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
is ſaved) unleſs the Plaintiffe who ſueth will give ſecurity to pay firſt
the Kings Debt; For otherwiſe if the Paty doth take forth Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
upon his Judgment and doth levy the money, the ſame money may
be ſeized upon to ſatisfie the Kings Debt, as appeareth in 45. <hi>E. 3.
title Decies tantum</hi> 13.</p>
            <p>The third Prerogative which the King hath, is That the King ſhall
have the Debt of the Debtor to the Kings Debtor paid unto him. <hi>v. 21
H.</hi> 7. 12. The Abbot of <hi>Ramſeys</hi> Caſe. The Prior of <hi>Ramſey</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted.
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:40982:145"/>
to the King, and another Prior was indebted to the Prior of
<hi>Ramſey:</hi> and then it was pleaded in Barr, that he had paid the ſame
Debt to the King, and the Plea holden for a good Plea. And if Rent
be due and payable unto me by my Leſſee for years, the ſame may be
taken for the Kings Debt, and the ſpecial matter ſhall be a good barr in
an <hi>Avowry</hi> for the Rent, 38. <hi>E.</hi> 3. 28. A Prior Alien was indebted to
the King for his Farm Rent: And being ſued for the ſame, he ſhewed,
That there was a Parſon who held a certain portion of Tythes from him
which were part of the Poſſeſſions of the ſame Priory, which he kept
in his hands, ſo as he could not pay the King his Farm-Rent unleſſe he
might have thoſe Tythes which were in the Parſons hands Wherefore a
Writ was awarded againſt the Parſon to appear in the Exchequer, and to
ſhew cauſe why he ſhould not pay the ſame to the King for the ſatisfying
of the Kings Rent: And there <hi>Skipwith</hi> Juſtice ſaid, That for any
thing which toucheth the King and may turn to his advantage to haſten
the Kings buſineſs, that the Exchequer had juriſdiction of it, were it a
thing Spiritual or Temporal. <hi>V. 44 E.</hi> 3. 43, 44. the like Caſe, but there
it is of a Penſion; And the Caſe of 38 <hi>Aſſ.</hi> 20. was the Caſe for Tythes:
See alſo 12 <hi>E. 3. Swalds</hi> Caſe to the ſame purpoſe. If two Coparceners
be in ward to the King, upon a ſuggeſtion that one of them is indebted
to the King, the ſtaying of his Livery ſhall be for his moytie untill the
King be ſatisfied his debt; but the other ſiſter ſhall have Livery of the
other moytie which belongs unto her, <hi>Fitz. N. 5. 263. a. Mich 19 E.</hi> 3.
and <hi>Hill. 20. E.</hi> 3. which was one and the ſame Caſe. The Kings Debtor
brought a <hi>Quo minus</hi> in the Exchequer againſt his Debtor: the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
appeared, And the Plaintiffe afterwards would have been Nonſuit,
but the Court would not ſuffer him ſo to be: And it was there ſaid,
That a Releaſe by the Kings Debtor unto his Debtor would not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
the Kings Debtor as to that Debt. In a <hi>Quo minus</hi> in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer
upon a Debt upon a ſimple Contract, the Defendant cannot
wage his Law, becauſe the King is to have a benefit by the ſuit, although
the King be no party to the ſuit, <hi>C. 4. par.</hi> 95.</p>
            <p>The fourth Prerogative which the King hath, is, That the King ſhall
have an Accompt againſt Executors, becauſe the Law there maketh a
privity; it being found by matter of Record, that the Teſtator was
indebted to the King, which Record cannot be denied. But in the Caſe
of a common perſon an Accompt will not lie againſt Executors for
want of privity. The Accompt which the King brings is <hi>ad computandum
ad Dominum Regem, &amp;c.</hi> without ſetting forth how the party came liable
to accompt: But a common perſon in his accompt brought ought to ſhew
how that the party was Receiver, Bailiff, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If a man doth entermeddle
with the Kings Treaſure (the King pretending a title to it) he ſhall be
chargeable for the ſame to the King, <hi>C. 11. part</hi> 89. the Earl of <hi>Devon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire's</hi>

the King paid the Subject for the Bullion: And afterwards becauſe

William Porter in officium illud tanquam ſufficientem,</hi> (and that they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered

did confeſſe; <hi>Ideo conſideratum eſt quod predict. Walweyen &amp; Piccard
onerentur erga Dominum Regem:</hi> And they afterwards were charged to
ſatisfie the King for all the monies which the King had paid for the
ſaid <hi>Porter:</hi> And although that none of the Kings treaſure came to
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:40982:146"/>
their hands, nor they had not any benefit as appeared by any matter in the
Caſe, yet becauſe they were the means and cauſers that the King ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
damage and loſſe, they were adjudged to be chargeable to the King,
<hi>C. 11. par.</hi> 93. this Caſe is there cited.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe Caſes vouched by me, I make divers Obſervations. 1. I
obſerve, That from Age to Age what care the Judges had for the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
and the recovering of the Kings Debts; becauſe <hi>Theſaurus Regis eſt
vinculum Pacis &amp; Bellorum nervus,</hi> And it is the ſlowing fountain of all
bounty unto the Subject. 2. I obſerve, That the King hath a Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
for the Recovery of Debts due unto him. 3. I obſerve, That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the Debt due to the King be puiſne or the leſſer Debt, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the Debtor be able and ſufficient to pay both Debts, <hi>viz.</hi> the
Kings Debt and the Debt owing to the Subject, yet the Kings Debt is to
be firſt paid.</p>
            <p>Now to apply theſe caſes to the Caſe in queſtion Here is a Subject who
is indebted to the King; And I ſay, That the Lands which ſuch a Debtor
hath in his power and diſpoſe (although he hath not any Eſtate in the
Lands) ſhall be liable to pay the Debt to the King: And I ſay, That
Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Hatton</hi> had a Fee in the Mannors and Lands in this caſe;
And although he did convey them <hi>bona fide,</hi> yet untill his death by reaſon
of the <hi>Proviſo</hi> of Revocation they were extendable. <hi>Trin. 24. E. 3. Rot. 4.
Walter de Chirton</hi> Cuſtomer, who was indebted to the King for the
Cuſtoms, purchaſed Lands with the Kings monies; and cauſed the
Feoffor of the Lands to enfeoffe certain of his friends, with an intent
to defraud and deceive the King; and notwithſtanding he himſelf took
the profits of the Lands to his own uſe: And thoſe Lands upon an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition
were found, and the values of them, and retorned into the
Exchequer; and there by Judgment given by the Court the Lands were
ſeized into the Kings hands, to remain there untill he was ſatisfied the
Debt due unto him; And yet the Eſtate of the Lands was never in
him: But becauſe he had a power, <hi>viz.</hi> by <hi>Subpena</hi> in Chancery to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
his Friends to ſettle the Eſtate of the Lands upon him, therefore they
were chargeable to the Debt. You will ſay perhaps, there was Covin
in that Caſe: But I ſay, that neither Fraud, Covin, nor Colluſion is
mentioned in the Report in <hi>Dyer 160. C. 11. par.</hi> 92. And that Caſe was
a harder Caſe then our Caſe is: For <hi>Walter de Chirton</hi> in that Caſe was
never ſeiſed of the ſaid lands: But in our Caſe Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Hatton</hi>
himſelf had the lands; And when he had the lands he was aſſured of
the Office, although he had not the poſſeſſion of it, For he was ſure that
no other could have it from him, and no other could have it but himſelf.
And for another cauſe, our Caſe is a ſtronger Caſe then the Caſe of
<hi>Walter de Chirton:</hi> For <hi>Chirton</hi> had no remedy in Law to have the
lands; but his remedy was only in a Court of Equity, and a remedy in
Conſc' onely: But in our Caſe, Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Hatton</hi> had a time in
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:40982:147"/>
which he might let the land to paſſe, and yet he had a power to pull it
back again at his pleaſure: So as he had the diſpoſition of it; but before
the alteration of the uſes he dyed: And if he had been living (being
indebted to the King) the King might have extended the lands, becauſe
that then he had the poſſeſſion of them. There were two Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which moved Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Hatton</hi> to Convey the Lands: the firſt
was honorable, <hi>viz.</hi> For the payment of his Debts; the ſecond was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
<hi>viz.</hi> For the preferment of his Children. Although the Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of the Lands for payment of his Debts was but for years, yet the
ſame was too ſhort, like unto a Plaiſter which is too ſhort for the ſore:
For the Covenanters were not his Executors, and ſo they were not liable
to Debts: And although he be now dead and cannot revoke the former
uſes, yet he had the power to revoke the uſes during his life; And ſo he
was chargeable for the Debt due to the King.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tanfield</hi> Chief Baron agreed with Juſtice <hi>Dodderidge</hi> in all as before:
And he ſaid, That all powerful and ſpeedy courſes are given unto the
King for the getting in of his Revenues; and therefore he ſaid he had
the ſaid Prerogatives as have been recited: And in 25 <hi>E. 3. in libro rubro</hi>
in the Exchequer, there the Foundations of the ſaid Prerogatives do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.
If a common perſon arreſt the body in Execution, he ſhall not
reſort to the lands, <hi>contr.</hi> to <hi>Blumfields</hi> Caſe, <hi>C. 5. par.</hi> The courſe of
the Exchequer makes a Law every where for the King. If any Officer
be indebted unto the King and dyeth, the courſe of the Exchequer is,
For to call in his Executors or the Heir, or the Terre-Tenants to anſwer
the Debt; and if he hath no lands, then a Writ iſſueth out of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer
to know what goods he had, and to whoſe hands they be come.
All Inquiſitions concerning Lands in the like Caſes are, <hi>Habuit vel
ſeiſitus;</hi> and not that he was ſeiſed onely. The word <hi>Habuit</hi> is a large
word, and in it is contained a diſpoſing power. But in this Caſe Sir
<hi>Chriſtopher Hatton</hi> had a power every day to revoke the uſes; And when
he had once revoked them, then was he again as before <hi>ſeiſitus. 7 H.</hi> 6.
in the Exchequer, the Kings Farmor had Feoffees to his uſe, and dyed
indebted to the King: And upon an Inquiſition it was found that
<hi>(Habuit)</hi> for he had them in his power by compelling his Feoffees by
Equity in Chancery; and therefore it was adjudged that the King
ſhould have the Lands in the Feoffees hands in extent. But in this caſe
Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Hatton</hi> might have had the Lands in him again without
compulſion by a Court of Equity, for that he had power to revoke the
uſes in the Conveyance at his pleaſure. <hi>Mich. 30. H. 6. rot.</hi> in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer:
A Clark of the Court was aſſigned to receive monies for the
King, who had Feoffees of lands to his uſe: And the lands were found
and ſeiſed for the Kings monies, by force of the word <hi>Habuit. 32 H. 6.
Philip Butler's</hi> Caſe, who was Sheriffe of a County, being indebted to

<hi>24 Eliz.</hi> in <hi>Morgan's</hi> Caſe it was adjudged, That lands purchaſed in the

the King.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hobart</hi> Lord Chief Juſtice of the Common Pleas argued to the ſame
purpoſe, and agreed with the other Juſtices; and he ſaid in this caſe it
was not material whether the Inquiſition find the Deed to be with power
of Revocation; For he ſaid that the Land is extended, and that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
remains good untill it be avoided: And he ſaid that a revocable
Conveyance is ſufficient to bind the Parties themſelves, but not to bind
the King; but the Lands are lyable into whoſe hands ſoever they come.
When a man is ſaid to forfeit his body, it is not to be intended his life, but
the freedom of his body, Impriſonment At the Common Law a Common
perſon could neither take the bodie nor the Lands in Execution; But
yet at the Common Law a <hi>Capias</hi> lay upon a force, although it did not
lie in caſe of Debt, Agreement, &amp;c. The King is <hi>Parens Legum,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Laws flowed from him: he is <hi>Maritus Legum,</hi> For the Law
is as it were under <hi>Covert Baron;</hi> he is <hi>Tutor Legum,</hi> For he is to direct
the Laws, and they deſire aid of him: And he ſaid that all the Land of
the Kings Debtor are liable to his Debt. The word <hi>(Debitor)</hi> is <hi>nomen
equivocum,</hi> and he is a Debtor who is any ways chargeable for Debt,
Damages, Dutie, Rent behind, &amp;c. The Law amplifies evry thing
which is for the Kings benefit, or made for the King. If the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſeth
all his Debts, he releaſes only debts by Recognizance. Judgment,
Obligation, Specialtie or Contract: Every thing for the benefit of the
King ſhall be taken largely, as every thing againſt the King ſhall be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
ſtrictly; and the reaſon why they ſhall be taken for his benefit is
becauſe the King cannot ſo nearly look to his particular, becauſe he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap>,
intended to conſider <hi>ardua regni pro bono publico.</hi> The Prerogative Laws
is not the Exchequer Law, but is the Law of the Realm for the King,
as the Common Law is the Law of the Realm for the Subject: The
Kings Bench is a Court for the Pleas of the Crown, The Common Pleas
is for Pleas betwixt Subject and Subject, and the Exchequer is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Court for the Kings Revenues, 13. <hi>E.</hi> 4. 6. If the King hath a Rent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge,
he by his Prerogative may diſtrein in any the Lands of the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
beſides in the Lands charged with the Rent, 44. <hi>E.</hi> 3. 15. although
that the partie purchaſeth the Lands after the Grant made to the King,
but then it is not for a Rent, but as for a dutie to the King: And the
King in ſuch caſe may take the Body. Lands and Goods in Execution.
See the Lord <hi>Norths</hi> Caſe, <hi>Dyer,</hi> 161. where a man became Debtor to
the King upon a ſimple Contract. <hi>N.</hi> When he was Chancellor of
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:40982:148"/>
the Augmentation received a Warrant from the Privy Councel, teſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the pleaſure of King <hi>E.</hi> 6. That whereas he had ſold to <hi>R.</hi> &amp;c. That
the ſaid Chancellor ſhould take Order and ſee the delivery of &amp;c. and
ſhould take Bond and Sureties for the King for the payment of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney;
By force of which Warrant, he ſent one <hi>T.</hi> his Clark to take a
Bond of <hi>W.</hi> for the payment of the money, and he took Bond for the
King accordingly, and brought the ſame to the Chancellor his Maſter,
and delivered the ſame to him to the Kings uſe; and preſently after he
deliverd the ſame back to <hi>T.</hi> to deliver over to the Clark of the Court,
who had the charge of the keeping of all the Kings Bonds and Special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
And when <hi>T.</hi> had received the ſame back, he practiſed with <hi>R.</hi> and
<hi>W.</hi> to deliver them the Bond to be cancelled, and ſo it was done, and
cancelled: And it was holden in that Caſe, becauſe that the ſaid Bond
was once in the power and poſſeſſion of <hi>N.</hi> that he was chargeable
with the Debt: But the Queen required the Debt of <hi>R.</hi> and <hi>W.</hi> who
were able to ſatisfie the Queen for the ſame.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Mildmay's</hi> Caſe cited before, there it was holden, That the Queen
might take her Remedy either againſt the Parties who gave the inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Warrant, or againſt <hi>Mildmay</hi> himſelf at her Election. So a man
(he ſaid) ſhall be lyable for damages to the King, for that is taken to
be within the word <hi>(Debita.)</hi> In <hi>Porters</hi> Caſe cited before, there was
neither Fraud, Covin, nor Negligence; and yet the perſons who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
<hi>Porter</hi> to the King to hold the Office were chargeable for his
negligence, whom they preferred to be Maſter of the Mint. But in that
Caſe, The Bodie and goods of <hi>Porter</hi> were delivered to his Sureties as
in Execution, to repay them the monie which the King had levied of
them. Theſe Caſes prove that the word <hi>(Debitor)</hi> is taken in a large
ſence: That the King ſhall have for the Debts due to him, the Bodie,
Goods and Lands in Execution. The word (Goods) doth extend to
whatſoever he hath, 11. <hi>H.</hi> 7. 26. The King ſhall have the Debt
which is due to his Debtor upon a ſimple Contract, and therein the
Debtor of the Debtor ſhall not wage his Law: For after you ſay that
you ſue for the King, it is the Kings Debt, and the King if he pleaſe
may have Evecution of it. An <hi>Ejectione firme</hi> was brought in the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
by <hi>Garraway</hi> againſt <hi>R. T.</hi> upon an Ejectment of Lands in <hi>Wales;</hi>
and it was maintainable in the Exchequer, as well as a Suit ſhall be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable
here for an Intruſion upon Lands in <hi>Wales</hi> upon the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf:
and the King ſhall have Execution of the thing, and recover Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages,
as he ſhall in a <hi>Quo minus,</hi> in ſatisfaction of a Debt which is
due by his Debtor to the King: 8. <hi>H.</hi> 5. 10. There the Kings Debtor
could not have <hi>Quo minus</hi> in the Exchequer; The Caſe there was,
That a man Indebted to the King was made Executor, and by a <hi>Quo
minus</hi> ſued one in the Exchequer who was indebted unto his Teſtator
upon a ſimple Contract, as for his proper debt; and the <hi>Quo minus</hi>
               <pb n="297" facs="tcp:40982:148"/>
would not lie, becauſe the King in that Caſe could not ſue forth Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
and every <hi>Quo minus</hi> is the Kings Suit, and is in the name of the
King, 38. <hi>Aſſ.</hi> 20. A Prior Alien was arrear in Rent to the King, The
Prior brought a <hi>Quo minus</hi> in the Exchequer againſt a Parſon for detai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of Tythes, (here is a variance of the Law and the Court; for the
Right of Tythes ought to be determined by the Eccleſiaſtical Law) and it
was found by Verdict for the Prior. A Serjeant moved, That the Court
had not juriſdiction of the Cauſe; To whom it was anſwered, that they
had and ought to have Juriſdiction of it: For that when a thing may
turn to the advantage of the King and haſten his buſineſs, that Court
had Juriſdiction of it: and divers times the ſaid Court did hold juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
in the like Caſe: and thereupon iſſue was joyned there, and the
Reporter made a <hi>mirum</hi> of it; But it ſeems the Reporter did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the Kings Prerogative: For it is true, That ſuch Suit for Tythes
doth not fall into the Juriſdiction of the Kings Bench, or Common
Pleas; but in the Exchequer it is otherwiſe; And if the Suit be by <hi>Quo
minus,</hi> it is the Kings Suit.</p>
            <p>At a common perſons Suit the Officer cannot break the houſe and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but at the Kings Suit he may: And a common perſon cannot enter
into a Liberty, but the King may if it be a common Liberty: But for
the moſt part when the King granteth any Liberty, there is a clauſe of
Exception in the Grant; That when it ſhall turn to the prejudice of
the King, as it may do in a ſpecial Caſe, there the King may enter the
Liberty; and a houſe is a Common Liberty, and the Execution of
Juſtice is no wrong when it is for the King. The King hath the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency

forth of Execution upon the Judgment, untill the King be ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Debt. In <hi>Dyer</hi> 296, &amp; 297. a man condemned in the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer

Afterwards upon prayer of the Partie, a <hi>Habeas Corpus cum cauſa</hi> was
awarded out of the Kings Bench to the Warden of the Fleet, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torned
the Cauſe <hi>ut ſupra,</hi> and he was remanded to the Fleet in Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for the Debt: Afterwards a Command was given by the Lord
Treaſurer upon the Queens behalf, to ſuffer the Priſoner to go into the
Countrie to collect and levie monie, the ſooner to pay the Queen
her Debt: In that Caſe the Subject brought an Action of Debt againſt
the Warden of the Fleet upon the Eſcape, who juſtified the Eſcape by
the ſaid Commandment; It was holden in that caſe, That although the
Partie was in Execution for both the Debts, yet before the Queen was
ſatisfied, the Execution for the Subject did not begin, For the King can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
have equall to have intereſt in the Body of the Priſoner <hi>Simul cum
illo:</hi> But if the Caſe were as <hi>Laſſels</hi> caſe, 3. <hi>Eliz Dyer,</hi> then he might
be in Execution for the King, and for the Subject.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſſels</hi> was taken in Execution at the Suit of a Subject, and before
the Writ was retorned, a Writ for the Queen came to the Sheriffe, and
<hi>Laſſels</hi> was kept in Execution for the Queen: In that caſe <hi>Laſſels</hi> was in
Execution for them both, <hi>viz.</hi> the Queen and the Subject. So there is
a difference where the Partie is firſt taken for the King, and where he
is firſt taken for the Subject.</p>
            <p>Now I will conſider of the Caſe at Barr; Whether the Land might
be extended notwithſtanding the Conveyance made. The Kings Debt
is to be taken largely, and ſo Goods in ſuch caſe are to be taken largely,
and ſo is it likewiſe of Lands, <hi>viz.</hi> any Land, be it Land in Uſe, upon
Truſt, by Revocation. By the Law, Debts are firſt to be paid, then Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacies,
then childrens preferments; There is a difference where the

<hi>Litt.</hi> 464. there it was ſaid that ſuch a Feoffor ſhall be ſworn upon an
Inqueſt, if the lands be of the value of <hi>40s. per annum,</hi> and that by the
Common Law; Therefore it ſeemeth that the Law doth intend, That
when a man hath Feoffees in Truſt, that the lands are his own; and then
if in ſuch caſe the Commonwealth ſhall be ſerved, ſhall not the King
who is <hi>Pater reipublicae</hi> be ſerved, ſo as he may be ſatisfied his debts?
If the Caſe of <hi>Walter de Chirton</hi> had never been, yet I ſhould now have
the ſame opinion of the Law in ſuch Caſe as the Judges then had. The
King is not bound by Eſtopels, nor Recoveris had betwixt ſtrangers,
nor by the fundamental Juriſdiction of Courts, as appeareth 38. <hi>Aſſ.</hi> 20.
where a Suit was for Tythes in the Exchequer, being a meer ſpiritual
thing; and ſhall he be bound by a Conveyance? <hi>Anno. 16. H.</hi> 6. then
in the time of Civil War Uſes began; and of Lands in uſe the Lord
Chief Baron <hi>Tanfield</hi> in his Argument hath cited diverſe caſes where
the lands in uſe were ſubject and lyable to the debt of <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe</hi> in
the Kings Caſe, and ſo was it untill the Statute of 27. <hi>H.</hi> 8. of Uſes was
made. <hi>Babbington,</hi> an Officer in the Exchequer, had lands in the hands
of Feoffees upon Truſt, and a Writ iſſued out, and the lands were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
for the Debt of <hi>Babbington</hi> in the hands of his Feoffees Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert
Dudley</hi> having lands in other mens hands upon Truſts, the lands
were ſeized into the Kings hands for a contempt (and not for debt or
damages to the King;) And in this Caſe although that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nquiſition
do find the Conveyance, but have not found it to be with power of
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:40982:150"/>
Revocation,; yet the Land being extended, it is well extended untill the
contrary doth appear, and untill the extent be avoided by matter of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,

            <p>
               <hi>Ley</hi> Chief Juſtice of the Kings Bench argued the ſame day, and his
Argument in effect did agree with the other Juſtices in all things, and
therefore I have forborne to report the ſame at length. And it was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged,
That the Extent was good, and the Land well decreed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</p>

417. The Lord SHEFFIELD and RATCLIFF'S Caſe.</head>
            <p>IN a Writ of Error brought to reverſe a Judgment given in a <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrans
de Droit</hi> in the Court of Pleas, The Caſe was put by <hi>Glanvile</hi>
who argued for <hi>Ratcliffe</hi> the Defendant, to be this. 2 <hi>E. 2. Malew</hi> being
ſeiſed of the Mannor of <hi>Mulgrave</hi> in Fee, gave the ſame to <hi>A. Bigot</hi> in
tail, which by divers diſcents came to Sir <hi>Ralph Bigot</hi> in tail, Who <hi>10
Jannarii 6 H.</hi> 8. made a Feoffment unto the uſe of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>is laſt Will, and
thereby after his Debts paid declared the uſe unto his right heirs in Fee,
and 9. <hi>H.</hi> 8. dyed. The Will was performed: <hi>Francis Bigot</hi> entred
being Tenant in tail, and 21 <hi>H.</hi> 8. made a Feoffment unto the uſe of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
and <hi>Katherine</hi> his wife, and to the uſe of the heirs of their two bodies.
Then came the Statute of 26 <hi>H. 8. cap.</hi> 13. by which Tenant in tail for
Treaſon is to forfeit the Land which he hath in tail. Then the Statute of
<hi>27 H.</hi> 8. of Uſes is made. Then 28 <hi>H. 8. Francis Bigot</hi> did commit
Treaſon, And 29 <hi>H.</hi> 8. he was attainted and executed for the ſame. <hi>Anno
31 H.</hi> 8. a private Act of Parliament was made, which did confirm the
Attaindor of <hi>Francis Bigot,</hi> and that he ſhould forfeit unto the King
(word for word as the Statute of 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. is) ſaving to all ſtrangers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the Offendor and his heirs, <hi>&amp;c. 3 E.</hi> 6. The heir of <hi>Francis Bigot</hi>
is reſtored in blood, <hi>Katherine</hi> entred into the Mannor and dyed ſeiſed.
<hi>8 Eliz.</hi> their Iſſue entred, and married with <hi>Francis Ratcliffe,</hi> and had
Iſſue <hi>Roger Ratcliffe,</hi> who is heri in tail unto <hi>Ralph Bigot,</hi> And they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
poſſeſſion untill 33. <hi>Eliz.</hi> And then all is found by Office and the
Land ſeiſed upon for the Queen, who granted the ſame unto the Lord
<hi>Sheffield. Francis Bigot</hi> and <hi>Dorothy</hi> die, And <hi>Roger Ratcliffe</hi> ſued a
<hi>Monſtrans de Droit</hi> to remove the Kings hands from off the lands, and
a <hi>Scire facias</hi> iſſued forth againſt the Lord <hi>Sheffield</hi> as one of the Terre-Tenants,
who pleaded all this ſpecial matter; and Judgment was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:40982:150"/>
given in the Court of Pleas for <hi>Roger Ratcliffe;</hi> And then the Lord
<hi>Sheffield</hi> brought a Writ of Error in the Exchequer-Chamber to reverſe
the ſaid Judgment: And <hi>Finch</hi> Serjeant argued for the Lord <hi>Sheffield</hi>
that the Judgment ought to be reverſed; And now this Term <hi>Glanvile</hi>
argued for <hi>Roger Ratcliffe,</hi> that the Judgment given in the Court of Pleas
ought to be affirmed.</p>
            <p>There are two points: The firſt, If there were a Right remaining in
<hi>Francis Bigot,</hi> and if the ſame were given unto the King by the Attaindor
and the Statute of 31 <hi>H.</hi> 8. Second. If a <hi>Monſtrans de Droit</hi> be a proper
Action upon this matter, which depends upon a Remitter; for if it be a
Remitter, then is the Action a proper Action. The Feoffment by <hi>Ralph
Bigot 6 H.</hi> 8. was a Diſcontinuance, and he had a new uſe in himſelf, to
the uſe of his Will, and then to the uſe of his Heirs: Then 9 <hi>H. 8. Ralph
Bigot</hi> dyed, And then <hi>Francis Bigot</hi> had a right to bring a Formedon in
the Diſcendor to recover his eſtate tail. 21 <hi>H<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 8. (then the point ariſeth)
<hi>Francis Bigot</hi> having a right of Formedon, and an uſe by force of the
Statute of 1 <hi>R. 3. cap.</hi> 1. before the Statute of 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. by the Feoffment
he had ſo ſetled it, that he could not commit a forfeiture of the eſtate tail.
When a man maketh a Feoffment, every Right, Action, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is given
away in the Livery and Seiſin, becauſe every one who giveth Livery
giveth all Circumſtances which belongs to it: For a Livery is of that
force, that it excludes the Feoffor not only of all preſent Rights, but of
all future Rights and Tytles, <hi>v. C. 1. par.</hi> 111. and there good Caſes put
to this purpoſe. 9 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 1. By Livery, the Husband who was in hope to
be Tenant by Courteſie, is as if he were never ſiſed. 39 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 43. The
Son diſſeiſeth his Father, and makes a Feoffment of the lands; the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
dyeth, the hope of the heir is given away by the Livery.</p>
            <p>It was objected by Serjeant <hi>Finch,</hi> 1. Where a man hath a right of
action to recover land in Fee or an eſtate for life which may be conveyed
to another, there a Livery doth give away ſuch a Right, and ſhall
there bind him: But an eſtate in tail cannot be transferred to another by
any manner of Conveyance, and therefore cannot be bound by ſuch
a Livery given. I anſwer, It is no good Rule, That that which doth not
paſſe by Livery, doth remain in the perſon which giveth the Livery.
<hi>19 H.</hi> 6. Tenant in tail is attainted, Office is found; The eſtate tail is
not in the King, is not in the perſon attainted, but is in abeyance: So
it is no good Rule which hath been put. When Tenant in tail maketh
a Feoffment, <hi>Non habet jus in re, neque ad rem:</hi> If he have a Right, then
it is a Right of Entre, or Action<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but he cannot enter nor have any action
againſt his own Feoffment, 19 <hi>H. 8. 7. Dyer.</hi> If Diſcontinuee of Tenant
in tail levieth a Fine with proclamations, and the five years paſſe, and
afterward Tenant in tail dyeth, his iſſue ſhall have other five years, and
ſhall be helped by the Statute, for he is the firſt to whom the right doth
accrue after the Fine levied; for Tenant in tail himſelf after his Fine with
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:40982:151"/>
Proclamations hath not any right: But if Tenant in tail be diſſeiſed, and
the Diſſeiſor levieth a Fine with proclamations, and five years paſſe, and
afterwards Tenant in tail dyeth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there the iſſue in tail is barred; for
there after the Fine levied the Tenant in tail himſelf had right, ſo as the
iſſue in tail was not the firſt to whom the Right did accrue after the
Fine levied, <hi>C. 3. part 87. Com. 374. a.</hi> When <hi>Ralph Bigot</hi> made
the Feoffment 6 <hi>H. 8. Francis Bigot</hi> had a Right; by his own Feoff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<hi>21 H.</hi> 8. his Right was extinguiſhed.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Objection was upon the Form of pleading in a <hi>Formedon,</hi>
viz. <hi>Poſt cujus mortem diſcendere debet</hi> to him, <hi>viz.</hi> the iſſue. Then the
Anceſtor had ſuch a Right, which after his death might have diſcended
to his iſſue; Then that proveth that the Anceſtor by his Feoffment
hath not given away all the Right. I anſwer, The form is not <hi>Poſt cujus
mortem,</hi> but <hi>Per cujus mortem;</hi> and the <hi>Poſt cujus mortem diſcendere
debet</hi> is not traverſable; and therefore it is but matterof form, and not of
ſubſtance. <hi>Old Entres</hi> 240. One <hi>dum non fuit compos mentis</hi> maketh a
Feoffment, he ſhall not avoid the Feoffment, becauſe that the Law doth
not allow a man to ſtultifie himſelf, <hi>C. 4. part</hi> 123. But his heir after his
death may avoid the Feoffment of his Anceſtor; for <hi>de ipſo diſcendit jus,</hi>
although the Father had not a Right in his life.</p>
            <p>It was thirdly objected out of <hi>C. 4. part 166. b.</hi> where it is ſaid, That
if an Ideot maketh a Feoffment, the King ſhall avoid the ſame after
Office found. I anſwer, That the Book it ſelf doth cleer the objection:
For it is in regard of the Statute of <hi>Prerogativa Regis, cap. 9. Ita quod
nullatenus per eoſdem fatuos alienentur, &amp;c.</hi> and not in reſpect of any
Right which the party hath who maketh the Feoffment. By the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Law, Tenant in tail, <hi>viz.</hi> He who had a Fee-ſimple conditional,
had not any right after his Feoffment: Then the Act of <hi>Weſt 2 cap.</hi> 1.
makes ſuch a Fee an Eſtate in tail, and provides for the iſſue in tail, for
him in the Remaindor or in Reverſion, but not for the party who made
the Feoffment or Grant; for a Grant of Tenant in tail is not void as to
himſelf. <hi>Magdalen</hi>-Colledge Caſe; A Leaſe by a Parſon is good againſt
himſelf, but voidable againſt his Succeſſor: And ſo the ſame is no Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
<hi>Diſcendit jus poſt mortem, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fourth Objection was, That although Tenant in tail had made a
Feoffment, yet he remained Tenant to the Avowry of the Donor,
and therfore ſome right of the old eſtate tail did remain in him. I anſwer,
<hi>5 E. 4. 3 a. 48 E. 3. 8. b. 20 H. 6. 9. 14 H. 4. 38. b. C. 2. part 30. a.</hi> The
matter of the Avowry doth not ariſe out of the Right or Intereſt which
a man hath in the Land, but out of the Privity: As when the Tenant
maketh a Feoffment, he hath neither right nor intereſt in the Land, yet
the Lord is not compellable to avow upon the Alienee before notice.
In a <hi>Precipe quod reddat</hi> the Tenant alieneth, yet he remaineth Tenant
as to the Plaintiffe, and yet he hath not either a Right or any Eſtate as to
the Alienee.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="303" facs="tcp:40982:151"/>
The fifth Objection was upon the Statute of 1 <hi>R. 3. cap.</hi> 1. All Feoff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> by <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe</hi> ſhall be effectual to him to whom it was
made againſt the Feoffor and his heirs. I anſwer, The words of the
Statute are to be conſidered, <hi>All Feoffments,</hi> &amp;c: I deſire to know how
this affirmative Law doth take away the power of the Feoffees: And
the Feoffees are bound by the Feoffment of <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe,</hi> and are ſeiſed
to the uſe of ſuch Alienees. 27 <hi>H. 8. 23. b.</hi> by <hi>Fitzherbert:</hi> If <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe</hi>
enter and maketh a Feoffment with warrantie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but there are not
words that the old rights are given away. The Feoffees to uſe before the
Statute of 1 <hi>R. 3. c.</hi> 1. might only make Feoffments; but after that Statute
<hi>Ceſtuy que uſe</hi> might alſo make Feoffments of the Lands: And ſo the
Statute of 1 <hi>R.</hi> 3. did not take away the power of the Feoffees, for they
yet may make Feoffments; but it did enlarge the power of <hi>Ceſtuy que
uſe, Com. 351, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>52.</hi> Then the Queſtion further riſeth: If <hi>Francis Bigot</hi>
had any Right in the Tail which might be forfeited by the Statutes, by
<hi>26 H.</hi> 8. and 31 <hi>H.</hi> 8. A particular Act made for the Attaindor of the
ſaid <hi>Francis Bigot.</hi> From the time of <hi>Weſt. 2. cap. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> untill the Statute of
<hi>26 H. 8. cap.</hi> 13. there were many Bills preferred in Parliament to make
Lands which were entailed to be forfeited for high Treaſon; but as long
as ſuch Bils were unmasked, they were ſtill rejected: But <hi>Anno 26 H.</hi> 8.
then at a Parliament a Bill was preferred, That all Inheritances might be
forfeited for Treaſon; (ſo that as under a vail) lands in tail were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited
for Treaſon) which was accepted of. The Statutes of 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. &amp;
<hi>31 H.</hi> 8. are not to be taken or extended beyond the words of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,
which are, <hi>That every Offender hereafter lawfully convict of any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of high Treaſon, by Preſentment, confeſſion, Verdict or Proceſs of Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawry,
ſhall forfeit, &amp;c.</hi> It doth not appear that <hi>Francis Bigot</hi> was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted
in any of theſe wayes; For the Inquiſition is, That he was In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
and convicted, but <hi>Non ſequitur</hi> that he was convict by any of
thoſe wayes, <hi>viz.</hi> Verdict, Confeſſion, or Outlawry; And one may be
attainted by other means: 4 <hi>E.</hi> 4. in <hi>Placito Parliamenti, Mortimer</hi> was
attainted by Parliament; 1 <hi>R. 2. Alice Percy</hi> was attainted by Judgment
of the Lords and Peers of the Houſe of Lords in Parliament.</p>
            <p>It was objected, That after an Indictment Verdict ought to follow:
I anſwer, <hi>Non ſequitur:</hi> for it may be without Verdict, <hi>viz.</hi> by ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
mute; And then the Statute of 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. doth not extend unto it,
<hi>C. 3. part</hi> 10, 11. Admit it were an Attaindor within the Statute of 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
H. 8. yet <hi>Francis Bigot</hi> had not ſuch lands which might be forfeited,
<hi>C. 3. part</hi> 10. For this Statute doth not extend to Conditions or Rights,
And <hi>C. 7. part</hi> 34. this Act of 26 H. 8. doth not extend to Rights and
Titles: And it is cleer that <hi>Francis Bigot</hi> had not any Eſtate within
the letter of the Act.</p>
            <p>It was objected, That if we have not ſet forth the full Title of the
King in the <hi>Monſtrans de Droit,</hi> then is the <hi>Monſtrans de Droit</hi> naught,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:40982:152"/>
and void. I anſwer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 9 <hi>E. 4. 51. 16 E.</hi> 4. 6. I find no book that in a <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrans
de Droit</hi> we ſhould be put to obſerve that Rule: For a Petition
were a going about; The Statute of 2 <hi>E. 6. cap.</hi> 6. gives the <hi>Monſtrans de
Droit: 16 E.</hi> 4. 7. If a Petition be void for want of inſtructing the King,
and if all his Title be not ſet forth in it, then the Court is to abate the
Petition; but after Judgment to find ſuch a fault, he muſt have a <hi>Scire
facias,</hi> and not a new Petition; and in our Caſe there was none who
gave in ſuch matter for the King.</p>
            <p>Now I come to the Statute of 31. <hi>H.</hi> 8. The particular Act for the
Attainder of <hi>Francis Bigot,</hi> and that he ſhould forfeit all ſuch Lands,
&amp;c. Conditions, Rights, &amp;c. in Fee, and Fee tail ſaving, &amp;c. and as the
lands of <hi>Francis Bigott</hi> ſtood ſtated at the time of the making of this
Act of 3. <hi>H.</hi> 8. the Statute did not extend to him to make him forfeit
any thing In the Statute of 33. <hi>H. 8. Cap.</hi> 20. there were as many
words as in this Statute of 31. <hi>H.</hi> 8. and many Caſes upon the Statute
of 33. <hi>H.</hi> 8. are adjudged upon the words, ſhall loſe and forfeit. There
is a difference betwixt an Act of Aſſurance, and an Act of Forfeiture:
If the words be, That the King ſhall enjoy and have, it is then an Act
of Aſſurance, and the lands are given to the King without Office; but
by an Act of Forfeiture the Lands are not in the King without Office
found. <hi>Exceptio firmat regulam,</hi> but our Caſe is out of the Rule. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings
in Acts of Parliaments were but of late days: 1. <hi>E.</hi> 4. there was
a private Act: A Petition was preferred againſt divers in Parliament for
ſundry miſdemeanours, and it was Enacted that they ſhould forfeit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the King and his heirs, &amp;c. in that Act there was no exception of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
for it was but a forfeiture of their Rights, and Savings were but
of late times, <hi>Trin. 8. H. 8. Rot.</hi> 4. A Petition of Right in the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery,
upon that was a plea which was after the Attainder of the Duke
of <hi>Suffolk)</hi> That the Duke did diſſeiſe him; it was ſhewed that the
Attainder was by Parliament, and he ſhewed no ſaving to be in the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
in the Petition; and yet it was well enough, <hi>Com. 552. Wyat</hi> Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
in tail of the Gift of the King, made a Feoffment, and by Act of
Parliament 2 <hi>Mariae</hi> was attainted of Treaſon, by which he was to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit,
&amp;c. as in our Caſe.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, That within two years after that Judgment, upon ſolemn
argument it was adjudged contrarie, <hi>Com.</hi> 562. It was objected that in
that Caſe a Writ of Error was brought, <hi>Com.</hi> 562. and that the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was affirmed in the Caſe of <hi>Walſingham.</hi> I anſwer, that the ſame
was by reaſon of the Plea in Barr: And <hi>Com</hi> 565. there <hi>Plowden</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth
that the Judges were not agreed of the matter in Law, and the
Lands in queſtion in <hi>Walſingams</hi> Caſe do remain with <hi>Moulton,</hi> and at
this day are enjoy'd contrary to the Judgment given in <hi>Walſinghams</hi> Caſe:
It was objected, That although this Act of 31. <hi>H.</hi> 8. was made after the
Attainder, yet that it ſhould relate to all the Lands which <hi>Francis Bigot</hi>
               <pb n="305" facs="tcp:40982:152"/>
had at the time of the Treaſon committed. I anſwer, That this Act of
<hi>31. H. 8:</hi> is but a deſcription what Lands he ſhall forfeit, <hi>viz.</hi> all the
Lands which he had at the time of the Treaſon committed.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Point is upon the Remitter of <hi>Roger Ratcliff</hi> before the
Inquiſition, for there was a diſcent to <hi>Roger Ratcliff.</hi> When Tenant in
Tail is attainted of Treaſon, his blood is not corrupted, <hi>C. 9. part. 10.
Lumleys</hi> Caſe. And the Statute of 33. <hi>H.</hi> 8. is the firſt Statute which
veſts Lands forfeit for Treaſon in the King without Office found: So as
according to the Lord <hi>Lumley's</hi> Caſe, <hi>C. 3. part.</hi> 10. before this Statute of
<hi>33 H.</hi> 8. the Land did diſcend to the iſſue in tail. The Rule of <hi>Nullum
tempus occurrit Regi,</hi> is to be meant for the preſerving of the Kings
Right, but not to make the King to do wrong. <hi>Com.</hi> 488. there the
Remitter is preferred before the King. 49. <hi>E.</hi> 3. 16. there the Deviſe
of a Common perſon was preferred before the Right of the King. 3. <hi>H.
7.</hi> 2. the Lord <hi>Greiſtock's</hi> Caſe: The Dean of <hi>York</hi> did recover againſt
him, and before Execution the Lord died, his heir within age; the Dean
ſhall have his Execution, notwithſtanding that the King hath right to
have the Ward: A <hi>fortiori</hi> a Remitter ſhall be preferred before the
Kings Title. <hi>C. 7. part.</hi> 28. The Rule <hi>Nullum tempus occurrit Regi,</hi> is
to be intended when the King hath an Eſtate or Intereſt certain and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent,
and not when his Intereſt is ſpecially limited, when and how
he ſhall take it, and not otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>The third Point was, Whether <hi>Ratcliff</hi> hath brought his proper
Action. The words of the Act of 2 <hi>E. 6. cap.</hi> 8. which giveth the <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrans
de Droit,</hi> are to be conſidered: A Remitter is within the words
of the Act. Divers Errors were aſſigned by the other ſide for matter
of Form. 1. Becauſe the <hi>Venire facias</hi> want theſe words <hi>(tam milites
quam alios.) Sheffield</hi> being a Noble man, and a Peer of the Realm, It
appeareth by the Regiſter 7. that the ſame was the ancient Form in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
common perſons Caſe; but of late that Form was left. 2. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
that it were a good Exception, then it ought to have been taken by
way of Challenge, as it appeareth 13. <hi>E. 3. Challenge 115. Dyer 107.
208.</hi> 3. The Statute of 35. <hi>H. 8. Cap.</hi> 6. makes a new Law, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes
a Form. <hi>Precipimus, &amp;c. quod Venire facias coram, &amp;c. 12 Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beros

<hi>(tam milites quam alios)</hi> yet here is a new Statute againſt it: And by
the Statute of 2. <hi>E. 6. Cap.</hi> 32. this Statute of 35 <hi>H.</hi> 8. is made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual.
And by the Statute of 27. <hi>Eliz. Cap.</hi> 6. the Statute of 35.
<hi>H.</hi> 8. is altered in <hi>parvo,</hi> and augmented in the worth of the Jurors:
and by the Statute of 18. <hi>Eliz. Cap.</hi> 14. It is Enacted, That after Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict,
&amp;c. the Judgment thereupon ſhall not be ſtayed or reverſed by
reaſon of any default in Form, or lack of Form, or variance from the
Regiſter. The ſecond Error aſſigned was, becauſe that there are two
<hi>Venire facias,</hi> and two <hi>Diſtringas,</hi> after that Iſſue was joyned. The
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:40982:153"/>
Lord <hi>Sheffield</hi> ſueth unto the King to have the firſt <hi>Venire facias,</hi> and
firſt <hi>Diſtringas</hi> quaſhed, and it was quaſhed with <hi>Ratcliff's</hi> conſent. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
admit there were two <hi>Venire facias,</hi> yet it ought to be intended
that the proceedings was but upon one of them, and that the beſt: <hi>M.
17. Jacobi,</hi> in the <hi>Common Pleas, Bowen</hi> and <hi>Jones's</hi> Caſe: In Error up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Recovery in Debt, there were two Originals certified, and there
the one was good, and the other naught; the Judges did take it that the
Judgment and proceedings were upon the good Original, and the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was affirmed in the Kings Bench: <hi>M. 15 H. 8. Rott.</hi> 20. the ſame
Caſe. Two Originals, one bearing date after the Judgment, the other
before the Judgment: and upon a Writ of Error brought, the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was affirmed, for by intendment the Judgment was given upon the
firſt Original, which bore date before the Iudgment. Another Error
was aſſigned, becauſe the Plea was, That ſuch a one was ſeiſed of the
Caſtle and Mannor of <hi>Mulgrave predictis</hi> in the plural number: I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
that there is not any colour for that Error, for the word <hi>(pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictis)</hi>
doth ſhew that the Mannor and Caſtle are not one and the ſame
thing: So upon the whole matter, I pray that the Iudgment given in the
Court of Pleas may be affirmed. Sir <hi>Henry Yelverton</hi> argued for the
Lord <hi>Sheffield,</hi> that the Iudgment might be reverſed. There are three
things conſiderable in the Caſe: Firſt, If any right of the ancient eſtate
tail was in <hi>Francis Bigot</hi> who was attainted, at the time of his Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:
Secondly, admit that there was an ancient right, if it might be
forfeited being a right coupled with a Poſſeſſion, and not a right in
groſs: Thirdly, Whether ſuch a Poſſeſſion diſcend to <hi>Francis Bigot,</hi>
that he ſhall be remitted, and if this Remitter be not overreached by
the Office. Firſt, If by the Feoffment of <hi>Francis Bigot, 21. H.</hi> 8.
when he was <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe,</hi> and by the Livery the right of the ancient
entail be deſtroyed; And I conceive it is not, but that the ſame conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues,
and is not gone by the Livery and Seiſin made: There is a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
when <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe</hi> makes a Feoffment before the Statute of
<hi>1 R:</hi> 3. and when <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe</hi> makes a Feoffment after the ſaid ſtatute
of 1 <hi>R: 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> For, before the ſtatute hee gives away all, <hi>Com</hi> 352. but
after the ſtatute of <hi>R. 3. Ceſtuy que uſe</hi> by his Feoffment gives away no
Right. In 3 H. 7, 13. is our very caſe almoſt; For, there the Tenant in
Tail made a Feoffment unto the uſe of his Will (ſo in our Caſe,) and
thereby did declare that it ſhould be for the payment of his debts, and
afterwards to the uſe of himſelf and the heirs of his body, and died; the
heir entred before the debts paid (but in our Caſe he entred after the
debts paid) there it is ſaid that the Feoffment is made as by <hi>Ceſtuy que
uſe</hi> at the Common Law, for his entrie was not lawfull before the debts
paid. But when <hi>Francis Bigot</hi> made a Feoffment 21 H. 8. he was <hi>Ceſtuy
que uſe</hi> in Fee, and then is the Right of the Eſtate tail ſaved by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:40982:153"/>
of 1. <hi>R.</hi> 3. And by the Statute of 1. <hi>R.</hi> 3. he gives the Land as Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
and not as Owner of the Land, and ſo gives nothing but a poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and no Right. 5 H. 7. 5. <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe</hi> ſince the Statute of 1 R.
3. is but as a Servant, or as an Executor to make a Feoffment. And if
an Executor maketh a Feoffment by force of the Will of the Teſtator,
he paſſeth nothing of his own Right, but only as an Executor or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant:
<hi>9 H.</hi> 7. 26. proves that <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe</hi> ſince the Statute of 1 <hi>R.</hi> 3
hath but only an Authority to make a Feoffment, For <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe</hi>
cannot make a Letter of Attorney to make Livery for him, for he hath
but a bare Authority, which cannot be transferred to another: <hi>Ceſtuy
que uſe</hi> hath a Rent out of Land, and by force of the Statute of 1 R. 3.
he maketh a Feoffment of the Land, yet the Rent doth remain to him,
for he giveth but a bare poſſeſſion: So in our Caſe, the right of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
Tail doth remain in <hi>Francis Bigot,</hi> notwithſtanding his Feoffment
as <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe</hi> by the Statute of 1 R. 3. If <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe</hi> by force
of the Statute of 1 R. 3. maketh a Feoffment without Warranty, the
Vouchee ſhall not Vouch by force of that Warranty; For as <hi>Fitzher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi>
ſaith, <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe</hi> had no poſſeſſion before the Statute of 27. <hi>H.
8. Cap. 10. 27 H.</hi> 8. 23. If Feoffees to Uſe make a Letter of Attorney
to <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe</hi> to make a Feoffment, he giveth nothing but as a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.
The Conſequent of this Point is, That the right of the old Eſtate
Tail was in <hi>Francis Bigot</hi> at the time of his Attainder, and was not gone
by the Feoffment made 21 <hi>H.</hi> 8.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Point is, Whether a right mixt with a poſſeſſion of <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis
Bigot</hi> might be forfeited by the Statutes of 26. <hi>H.</hi> 8. and the private
Act of 31. <hi>H.</hi> 8. The Statute of 31. <hi>H.</hi> 8. doth not ſave this Right no
more then the Statute of 26. <hi>H.</hi> 8. For they are all one in words. I
ſay that he hath ſuch a right as may be loſt and forfeited by the words
of the Statute of 26. <hi>H. 8. Cap.</hi> 13. For that Statute giveth three
things. Firſt, It gives the Forfeiture of Lands, and not of Eſtates. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
How long doth that Statute give the lands to the King? For e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
<hi>viz.</hi> to the King his Heirs and Succeſſors. Thirdly, It gives the
lands of any Eſtate of Inheritance, in Uſe or Poſſeſſion, by any Right,
Title or means. This Eſtate Tail is an Eſtate of Inheritance, which he
hath by the Right, by the Title, and by the means of coming to the
Right it is forfeited. Theſe two Statutes were made for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Child, For the Common Law was ſtrict enough againſt the
Father, <hi>viz.</hi> he who committed the Treaſon; And ſhall the ſame Law
which was made to puniſh the Child, be undermined to help the Child?
The ancient Right ſhall be diſplaced from the Land, rather then it ſhall
be taken from the Crown, which is to remain to the Crown for ever.
And this Statute of 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. was made <hi>pro bono<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> publico,</hi> and it was
the beſt Law that ever was to preſerve the King and his Succeſſors from
Treaſon, for it is as it were a hedg about the King; For before this
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:40982:154"/>
Statute, Tenant in Tail had no regard to commit Treaſon, For he forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his Lands but during his own life, and then the Lands went to the
iſſue in Tail: But this Statute doth puniſh the Child for the Fathers
offence, and ſo maketh men more careful not to offend, leaſt their poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
may beg. I take two grounds which are frequent in our Law: Firſt,
That the King is favoured in the Expoſition of any Statute. <hi>Com. 239,
240.</hi> The ſecond, That upon the conſtruction of any Statute, nothing
ſhall be taken by equity againſt the King. <hi>Com.</hi> 233, 234. Here in this
Caſe although the Right were not in poſſeſſion, yet it was mixed with
the poſſeſſion, from <hi>Anno 13. E.</hi> 1. untill 26. <hi>H.</hi> 8. Tenant in Tail
feared not to commit Treaſon, For the Statute of <hi>Weſt.</hi> 2. did preſerve
the Eſtate Tail, ſo as the Father could not prejudice his iſſue <hi>per factum
ſuum:</hi> And therefore the Commonwealth conſidering that a wicked
man did not care what became of himſelf, ſo as his iſſue might be ſafe,
provided this Statute of 26. <hi>H. 8. Cap.</hi> 13. although the Statute of 16.
<hi>R. 2. Cap.</hi> 5. which giveth the Premunire, doth Enact that all Lands
and Tenements of one attainted in a Premunire ſhall be forfeited to the
King: Yet Tenant in Tail in ſuch Caſe did not forfeit his Lands: <hi>C. 11.
part. 63. b.</hi> as the Statute of <hi>Weſt. 2. Cap.</hi> 1. ſaith in particular words,
That Tenant in Tail ſhall not prejudice his iſſue; Therefore the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of 26. <hi>H.</hi> 8. in particular words ſaith, That Tenant in Tail ſhall
forfeit his Lands for Treaſon. The Right of <hi>Francis Bigot</hi> is not a right
in groſs, but a Right mixed with a poſſeſſion. The Statute of <hi>Weſt.
2. Cap.</hi> 1. brought with it many miſchiefs; For by that Statute, the
Anceſtor being Tenant in Tail, could not redeem himſelf out of priſon,
nor help his wife, nor his younger children; and that miſchief conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
untill 12. <hi>E. 4. Taltaram's</hi> Caſe, and then the Judges found a
means to avoid thoſe miſchiefs by a common Recovery; and this Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a common Recovery was a great help to the Subject. Then
came the Statute of 32. H. 8. <hi>Cap.</hi> 36. which Enacted, That Fines le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied
by Tenant in Tail, ſhould be a good barr to the iſſue of any Eſtate,
any way entailed. If the Son, iſſue in tail, levieth a Fine in the life of
his Father who is Tenant in tail, it ſhall be a barr to him who levieth
the Fine, and to his iſſues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And both theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the Common Recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and the ſaid Statute did help the Purchaſer; And ſhall not this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of 26. H. 8. help the King? The Statute of 26. H. 8. <hi>Cap.</hi> 13.
hath not any ſtrength againſt the Anceſtor, but againſt the Child. For
the Conſtruction of Statutes I take three Rules; Firſt, When a Caſe
hapneth which is not within the Letter, then it is within the intent and
equity of the Statute, <hi>Com.</hi> 366. 464. Secondly, All things which may be
taken within the miſchief of the Statute, ſhall be taken within the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Statute 4. H. 6. 26. <hi>per Martin.</hi> Thirdly, When any
thing is provided for by a Statute, every thing within the ſame miſchief
is within the ſame Statute, 14. H. 7. 13. The Eſtate tail of <hi>Francis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

Bigot</hi> and <hi>Katharine</hi> his wife is forfeited by the Statute of 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8.
There is a difference when the Statute doth fix the forfeiture upon the
perſon, As where it is enacted that <hi>J. S.</hi> ſhall forfeit his lands which he
had at the time of his Attaindor; The Judges ought expound that Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
only to <hi>J. S.</hi> But the Statute of 26 H. 8. doth not fix the forfeiture
upon the perſon, but upon the land it ſelf: And Expoſition of Statutes
ought to extend to all the miſchiefs. 8 <hi>Eliz.</hi> Sir <hi>Ralph Sadler's</hi> Caſe in
<hi>B. R.</hi> where an Act of Parliament did enact, That all the lands of <hi>Sadler</hi>
ſhould be forfeited to the King, of whomſoever they were holden:
<hi>Sadler</hi> held ſome lands of the King; in that caſe the King had that land
by Eſcheat by the Common-Law, and not by the ſaid Statute. <hi>Com.</hi> 563,
The Law ſhall ſay, that all the rights of the tail are joyned together to
ſtrengthen the eſtate of the King. Tenant in tail, before the Statute of
<hi>1 E. 6. cap.</hi> 14. of <hi>Chauntries,</hi> gave lands to ſuperſtitious uſes, which were
enjoyed five years before the ſaid Statute of 1 <hi>E.</hi> 6. made; Yet it was
adjudged that the right of the iſſue was not ſaved, but that the land was
given to the Crown; for the iſſue is excluded by the <hi>ſaving</hi> in the ſaid
Statute. If Tenant in tail give the lands to charitable uſes; the iſſue is
barred, For the <hi>ſaving</hi> of the Statute of 39 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 5. excludes him,
And he is bound by the Statute of <hi>Donis.</hi> So the Statute of 26 H. 8.
<hi>cap.</hi> 13. and the private Act of 31 H. 8. do ſave to all but the heirs of the
Offenders.</p>
            <p>The third Objection was, That <hi>Ratcliffe</hi> was not excluded by the
<hi>ſaving;</hi> for it was ſaid, That the ſame doth not extend but to that which
is forfeited by his Anceſtors body: And here <hi>Ratcliffe</hi> had but a Right,
and that was ſaved; And the Statute doth not give Rights. I anſwer,
firſt, The Statute of 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. is not to be expounded by the letter, for
then nothing ſhould be forfeited but that only which he had in poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and uſe. Tenant in tail is diſſeiſed and attainted for treaſon: By the
words of the ſaid Statute of 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. he forfeits nothing, yet the iſſue in
tail ſhall forfeit the lands; for the iſſue in tail hath a right of Entrie
which may be forfeited, 6 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 9. A right of Entrie may eſcheat, and
then it may be forfeited. Secondly, The Statute is not to be conſtrued
to the poſſeſſion; but if he hath a mixt right with the poſſeſſion, it is
forfeited, but a right in groſſe is not forfeited. Tenant in tail of a Rent
or Seignorie purchaſeth the Tenancie or the Land out of which the Rent
is iſſuing, and is attainted; He ſhall forfeit the Seignorie and Rent, or
the Land, for the King ſhall have the Land for ever, And then the Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norie
or Rent ſhall be diſcharged, for otherwiſe the King ſhould not
have the Land for ever; For the King cannot hold of any Lord a Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norie,
<hi>11 H.</hi> 7. 12. The heir of Tenant in tail ſhall be in Ward for a
Meanaltie deſcended unto him, the Meanaltie not being in <hi>eſſe;</hi> and yet
it ſhall be ſaid to be in <hi>eſſe,</hi> becauſe of the King, <hi>C. 3 part 30. Cars</hi> Caſe:
Although the Rent was extinguiſhed, yet as to the King it ſhall be in <hi>eſſe.</hi>
               <pb n="310" facs="tcp:40982:155"/>
The difference is betwixt a Right clothed with a poſſeſſion, and a right
in groſſe, <hi>viz.</hi> where the Right is ſevered from the poſſeſſion, there it is
in groſſe, For there the Right lieth only in Action; and therefore nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the Statute of 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. nor by the private Act of 31 <hi>H.</hi> 8. ſuch a
Right is not forfeited, <hi>C. 3. part 2. C. 10. part</hi> 47, 48. Right of Action
by the Common-Law nor by Statute-Law ſhall eſcheat, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is not forfeited: For no Right of Action is forfeitable, becauſe
the right is in one, and the poſſeſſion in another. <hi>Perkins</hi> 19. A Right
<hi>per ſe</hi> cannot be charged. 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 20. by <hi>Mountague,</hi> A man cannot give
a Right by a Fine, unleſs it be to him who hath the poſſeſſion; <hi>C. 10. part
Lampits</hi> Caſe; Sever the poſſibility from the right, and it doth not lie
in grant or forfeiture; but unite them (as they are in our Caſe) and
then the Right may be granted or forfeited, for that Right clothed with
a poſſeſſion may be forfeited. A Right clothed with the poſſeſſion, 1. It
taſtes of the poſſeſſion, 2. It waits upon the poſſeſſion, 3. It changes the
poſſeſſion. The Biſhop of <hi>Durham</hi> hath all Forfeitures for Treaſon by
the Common-Law within his Dioceſs, <hi>viz.</hi> the Biſhoprick of <hi>Durham:</hi>
And if Tenant in tail within the Biſhoprick commits Treaſon and dyeth,
the Iſſue in tail ſhall enjoy the land againſt the Biſhop, <hi>Dyer 289 a. pl.</hi> 57.
For the Biſhop hath not the land for ever, but the Iſſue in tail may have
a <hi>Formedon</hi> againſt the Biſhop: But in our Caſe it is otherwiſe: Tenant
in tail maketh a Feoffment, and takes back an eſtate unto himſelf in tail,
the remainder in Fee to his right heirs; The Biſhop in ſuch caſe ſhall
not have the land forfeited for Treaſon, becauſe that the Biſhop cannot
have the eſtate tail; but in ſuch caſe the King ſhall have the Land by the
Statute of 26 <hi>H. 8. cap.</hi> 13. And the Biſhop in ſuch caſe ſhall not have
the Fee, becauſe it is one eſtate, and the King ſhall not wait upon the
Subject, <hi>viz</hi> the Biſhop. The Right waits upon the poſſeſſion: For
<hi>11 H.</hi> 7. 12. If the ſon and a ſtranger diſſeiſeth the father, and the father
dyeth, this right infuſeth it ſelf into the poſſeſſion, and changeth the
poſſeſſion, And it is a Releaſe in fact by the father to the ſon, 9 <hi>H. 7. 25.
Br' Droit</hi> 57. A Diſſeiſor dyeth ſeiſed, and his heir enters and is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeiſed
by <hi>A.</hi> The firſt Diſſeiſee doth releaſe unto <hi>A.</hi> all his right; All
the right is now in the ſecond Diſſeiſor, <hi>viz. A.</hi> becauſe the right and the
poſſeſſion meet together in <hi>A. 40 E. 3. 18. b.</hi> Tenant in tail makes a
Leaſe for life with warranty: If Tenant for life be impleaded by the
heir to whom the warranty doth diſcend, he ſhall rebut the right in tail
being annexed with the poſſeſſion, for that is in caſe of a ſaving of the
land by that right: But where one demands land, there all the Right
ought to be ſhewed. 11 <hi>H.</hi> 4 37. If a man be to bring an Action to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover,
then he ought to make a good title by his beſt right, if he hath
many rights: But if a man be in poſſeſſion, and an Action be brought
againſt him, then he may defend himſelf by any of his rights, or by all
his rights. 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 21. Tenant in tail maketh a Feoffment to his uſe
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:40982:155"/>
upon Condition, and afterwards upon his Recogniſance the land is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
and afterwards the Condition is performed, yet the intereſt of
the Conuſee ſhall not be avoided; For although the Extent come upon
the Fee, and not upon the Tail, yet when the Extent was, it was extract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out of all the rights. <hi>C. 7. part</hi> 41. A Tenant in tail makes a Leaſe
for life, now he hath gained a new Fee by wrong; and afterwards he
makes a Leaſe for years, and Tenant for life dyeth; He ſhall not avoid
his Leaſe for years, although he be in of another eſtate, becauſe he had
a defeicible title and an ancient right, the which if they were in ſeveral
hands ſhall be good, as the Leaſe of the one, and the Confirmation of
the other; And being in one hand, it ſhall be as much in Law as a ſaving
of the Right.</p>
            <p>In our Caſe, the Right and Poſſeſſion both were in <hi>Francis Bigot;</hi>
And <hi>Ratcliffe</hi> is entitled to the old eſtate tail, and to the new alſo.
There is a difference betwixt him who claims the land ſo forfeited to the
King; and the heir of the body of the perſon attainted: <hi>Litt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>719.</hi> Land
is given to <hi>A</hi> and the iſſue males of his body, the remainder to the heirs
females of his body: If the Father commit Treaſon, both heir male and
female are barred, for they both claim by the Father; but if the heir
male after the death of his Father be attainted of Treaſon, the King ſhall
have the lands as long as he hath iſſue male of his body, and then the
heir female ſhall have the lands, for ſhe ſhall not forfeit them, becauſe
ſhe claimeth not by the brother, but by the father. <hi>Com. in Manxels caſe,</hi>
A man hath three ſeveral rights of eſtate tails, and comes in as Vouchee;
If the Recovery paſs, it ſhall bar all his Rights for one Recompence,
and they ſhall be all bound by one poſſeſſion. There is a difference
where the Kings title is by Conveyance of the party, and where for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture
for Treaſon by this Statute of 26 <hi>H. 8. cap. 13. v.</hi> the Abbot
of <hi>Colcheſters</hi> Caſe: The Abbot ſeiſed in the right of his houſe, did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
Treaſon, and made a Leaſe for years, and then ſurrendred his houſe
to the King after the Statute of 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. The queſtion was whether the
King ſhould avoid the Leaſe: It was adjudged, That the King was in
by the ſurrender, and ſhould not avoid the Leaſe, and not by the Statute
of 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. But if the King had had it by force of the Statute, then the
King ſhould have avoided the Leaſe. <hi>Com.</hi> 560. Tenant in tail, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
to the King: Tenant in tail maketh a Leaſe for years, and is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted
of Treaſon; The King ſhall avoid the Leaſe upon the conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Statute of 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. which gives the lands unto the King
for ever.</p>
            <p>The third point is upon the Remitter. This point had been argued by
way of Admittance: For as I have argued<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The ancient right is given
away unto the King; and then there is no ancient right, and ſo no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitter.
There is a difference where the iſſue in tail is forced to make a
Title, and where not: In point of defence he is not ſo preciſely forced
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:40982:156"/>
to make his Title, as he is in caſe of demand. Whereas the Defendant
demands the lands from the King, the Diſcent will not help him, becauſe
the Attaindor of the Anceſtor of <hi>Ratcliffe</hi> hinders him in point of title
to make a demand, <hi>Dyer 332 b.</hi> In this caſe he ought to make himſelf
heir of the body of <hi>Francis Bigot</hi> and <hi>Katharine. C. 8. part 72. C. 9.
part</hi> 139, 140. There <hi>Cook</hi> couples the Caſe of Fine levied, and the Caſe
of Attaindor together. <hi>C. 8. part</hi> 72. Land is given to husband and wife,
and to the heirs of their two bodies: The husband alone levies a Fine
with proclamations, Or is attainted of Treaſon and dyeth: The wife
before Entry dyeth: The iſſue is barred; and the Conuſee, or King hath
right unto the land, becauſe the iſſue cannot claim as heir to them both,
<hi>viz.</hi> father and mother, for by the father he is barred. 5 <hi>H. 7. 32, 33.
C. 9. part</hi> 140. Husband and wife Tenants in tail; If one of them be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted
of Treaſon (as it was in our Caſe) the lands ſhall not diſcend to
the iſſue, becauſe he cannot make title. And there <hi>Cook</hi> puts the Caſe,
That if lands be given to an Alien and his wife, they have a good eſtate
tail, and yet it is not diſcendable to the iſſue. The Conſequence then of
all this is, That if <hi>Ratcliffe</hi> cannot take advantage of the diſcent by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the diſability by Attaindor, <hi>à fortiori</hi> he ſhall not be remitted:
And yet I confeſs that in ſome Caſes one may be remitted againſt the
King, <hi>Com.</hi> 488, 489, 553. But that is where the King is in by matter of
Law by Conveyance; but in this Caſe the King is in by an Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
and there ſhall be no Remitter againſt a matter of Record.
Another reaſon is, becauſe that the poſſeſſion is bound by the Judgment
of Attaindor and the Act of Parliament. 5 <hi>H. 7. 31. 7 H. 7. 15. 16
H.</hi> 7. 8. A diſcent of land ſhall not make a title againſt the King or any
other who hath the land by an Act of Parliament.</p>
            <p>But then in our Caſe, If there ſhould be a Remitter, yet the ſame is
overreached by the Office. <hi>

                  </gap>-part</hi> 10. before the Statute of 33 H. 8.
<hi>cap.</hi> 20. there ought to have been an Office found in the Caſe of Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
of Treaſon, <hi>Br. Caſes 103. Brook Office Devant, &amp;c.</hi> 17. I do not
mean an Office of intitling, but an Office declaratory of a conſpicuous
title. <hi>C. 5. part</hi> 52. There are two manner of Offices; One which veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the eſtate and poſſeſſion of the land &amp;c. in the King; Another which
is an Office of Inſtruction; and that is when the eſtate of the land is
lawfully in the King, but the particularity thereof doth not appear upon
record: And the Office of Inſtruction ſhall relate to the time of the
Attaindor, not to make Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> in our Caſe in by diſcent, but
to avoid all me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ne Incombrances; And is not this Remitter an Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance?
And for that purpoſe the Office ſhall relate: For in things of
Continuance <hi>Nullum tempus occurrit Regi, C. 7. part</hi> 28. For ſo the
rule of <hi>Nullum tempus &amp;c.</hi> is to be underſtood of a thing of Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
and not a thing <hi>unica vice,</hi> v. <hi>Fitz. Entre Congeable, 53. Trav.</hi> 40.
where it is ſaid, Where the King hath cauſe to ſeiſe for the forfeiture of
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:40982:156"/>
Tenant for life, if the Tenant for life dyeth, the Reverſion may enter;
for in that caſe <hi>Tempus occurrit Regi,</hi> and the King cannot ſeize after the
death of the Tenant for life. 35 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 57. There is no diſcent againſt the
King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and if there be no diſcent, then there is no Remitter. The conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of all this is, That the Office doth relate to the Right, And that
the <hi>Monſtrans de Droit</hi> doth not lie: And the want of Office found for
all this time, was the fault of the Kings Officers, and ſhall not prejudice
the King. But if the Office ſhould not relate, then the <hi>Monſtrans de
Droit</hi> would lie, becauſe then the King was in but by one ſingle matter
of Record. We ſhew in the Office, 33 <hi>Eliz.</hi> That there iſſued forth a
Commiſſion directed to certain of the Privy-Councel to enquire of the
Treaſon; and if <hi>Francis Bigot</hi> upon the Treaſon were Indicted. And
in our Caſe we ſhew immediately another Commiſſion was directed to
the Lord Chancellor and the two Chief Juſtices &amp;c. to arraign <hi>Francis
Bigot.</hi> And all that is confeſſed by <hi>Ratcliffe</hi> himſelf, <hi>viz. modo &amp; forma.</hi>
And therefore the Objection which <hi>Glanvile</hi> made was frivolous, <hi>viz.</hi>
That it did not appear that <hi>Francis Bigot</hi> was attainted by Verdict, by
Confeſſion, or by Outlawry. And ſo he concluded, That for theſe
cauſes the Judgment given in the Court of Common-Pleas ought to be
reverſed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>George Crook</hi> argued for <hi>Ratcliffe,</hi> and he prayed that the Judgment
might be affirmed. I will argue only theſe points following. 1. That
<hi>Francis Bigot</hi> had not ſo much as a right of Action at the time of his
Attaindor, for he had not any right at all. 2. Admit that he had a right
of Action, If this right of Action be given to the King by the ſaid Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
of 26 &amp; 31 <hi>H.</hi> 8. It was objected, That the right being clothed
with a poſſeſſion, that the ſame is given to the King: But I will prove
the contrary. 3. When <hi>Francis Bigot</hi> being Tenant in tail, and being
attainted and executed for Treaſon, and then <hi>Katherine</hi> his wife dyeth
being one of the Donees in tail, 21 <hi>H.</hi> 8. and the lands diſcend to <hi>Ratcliff,</hi>
If the Office afterwards found ſhall relate to take away the Remitter.
I ſay it doth not, but that his Remitter doth remain to maintain his
<hi>Monſtrans de Droit,</hi> and he is not put to his Petition. The chief point is,
What right <hi>Francis Bigot</hi> had at the time of his Attaindor. 1. When
<hi>Ralph Bigot</hi> being Tenant in tail, 6 <hi>H.</hi> 8. made a Feoffment in Fee, what
right remained in <hi>Francis</hi> his Son? The right is in abeyance, <hi>viz. in
nubibus,</hi> that is <hi>in cuſtodia Legis:</hi> And then <hi>Francis Bigot</hi> had no right
of that entail 21 <hi>H.</hi> 8. when he made the Feoffment. <hi>Com.</hi> 487. There
<hi>Jus</hi> is divided, <hi>viz. Jus recuperandi, Jus in randi, Jus habendi, Jus reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nendi,
Jus percipiendi, Jus poſſedendi;</hi> but here <hi>Francis Bigot</hi> had not any
of theſe rights. <hi>Com.</hi> 374. if the Diſcontinuee of Tenant in tail levieth
a Fine with proclamations, and five years paſſe, and Tenant in tail
dyeth, the iſſue in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> tail ſhall have other five years, becauſe he is the
firſt to the right. 19 <hi>H. 8. 7. C. 7. part</hi> 81. If Donee in tail maketh a
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:40982:157"/>
Feoffment in Fee, <hi>in rei veritate</hi> the Donee hath not <hi>jus in re, neque ad
rem. C. 3. part 29. Litt.</hi> 649. There it appeareth that the right to an
eſtate tail may be in abeyance. <hi>Com. 552. Walſinghams</hi> Caſe: There the
King gave land in tail to <hi>Wyat,</hi> who made a Feoffment unto <hi>Walſingham;</hi>
Afterwards <hi>Wyat</hi> was attainted of Treaſon, and there the eſtate tail of
<hi>Wyat</hi> was forfeited; but the cauſe there was, becauſe that the reverſion
was in the Crown, and ſo no diſcontinuance by his Feoffment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that the reverſion was in the Crown. In our Caſe, no right of the
eſtate tail was in <hi>Francis Bigot</hi> after the Feoffment unto his own uſe, but
the right is in abeyance. It was objected, That the Writ of <hi>Formedon</hi> is
<hi>Diſcendit jus,</hi> and the <hi>Monſtrans de Droit</hi> was ſo: I anſwer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is ſo in
point of form in the Writ, but not in ſubſtance. <hi>C. 7. part</hi> 14. Tenant
in tail makes a Leaſe for life, and Tenant for life dyeth: Now he hath
an ancient right, and the Donor may avow upon the Tenant in tail not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
his Feoffment, but that is by reaſon of privity, and not by
reaſon of any right he hath. <hi>Jus recuperandi</hi> did diſcend to the iſſue in
tail, <hi>viz. Francis Bigot, 21 H.</hi> 8. He who hath a right of Action giveth
the ſame away by his Livery and Feoffment, as appeareth by the Caſes
put in <hi>C. 1. part</hi> 111. It was objected, That <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe</hi> was an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney
or Servant, therefore he doth not paſſe his own right, for he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
make an Attorney to make Livery; and 9 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 26. was cited to be
adjudged ſo: But it is adjudged to the contrary, <hi>M. 25 H.</hi> 8. in the
Kings Bench, <hi>rot.</hi> 71. betwixt the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Kellet,</hi> as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
in <hi>Dyer</hi> 283. and <hi>Bendloe's</hi> Reports, and <hi>C. 9. part</hi> 75. For
there it is expreſſe, that <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe</hi> may make a Letter of Attorney
to make Livery; which proves that he makes not the Feoffment as a
Servant, but as Owner of the Land. It was objected, That <hi>Cueſty que
uſe</hi> was as an Executor: but that I deny. 49 <hi>E. 3 17 a. Perſay:</hi> Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
cannot make a Feoffment, but they ought to make a Sale; and the
Vendee, <hi>viz.</hi> the Bargainee is in without Livery and Seiſin: But if they
do make a Feoffment by the Livery, all their right is given away: But
if an Attorney giveth Livery in the name of his Maſter, nothing of his
own right to the ſame Land is given away by the Livery and Seiſin;
but if he maketh Livery in his own name, then he giveth away his own
right; and the Statute of 1 <hi>R. 3. cap.</hi> 1. maketh the Feoffment good
which is made by <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe</hi> againſt him and his heirs. <hi>C. 1. pt.</hi> 111.
By Livery and Seiſin his whole right is given away. <hi>Com.</hi> 352. The
Feoffees of <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe</hi> are diſſeiſed; the Diſſeiſor enfeoffeth <hi>Ceſtuy
que uſe,</hi> who enfeoffs a ſtranger. And the Queſtion was, If by this
Feoffment made by <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe</hi> the right of the firſt Feoffees were
determined and extinct. <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> held that the right was gone; and
in that caſe the Uſes were raiſed after 1 <hi>R.</hi> 3. and before 27 <hi>H. 8. cap.</hi> 10.
Although <hi>Yelverton</hi> held that it was meant of a Feoffment before the
Statute of 1 <hi>R. 3. Jus recuperandi</hi> was in <hi>Francis Bigot.</hi> Then the
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:40982:157"/>
queſtion is, Whether this Right were given away by the Statutes of 26
&amp; 31 <hi>H.</hi> 8. The Statute of 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. &amp; 31 <hi>H.</hi> 8. are ſeveral and diſtinct
Statutes: The words of the Statute of 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. are, <hi>That the party of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
ſhall forfeit all his Poſſeſſion and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe;</hi> but there is no word of
<hi>Right</hi> in the Statute; and that Statute doth not extend to give any land
but that which was in poſſeſſion or uſe: And the cauſe was, becauſe
before that Statute of 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. Uſes were not given unto the King for
Attaindor for Treaſon, they being but a Truſt and Confidence. <hi>C. 11.
part 36 b.</hi> The Statute ſayes, <hi>By any wayes, title, or means:</hi> But obſerve
when this Statute was made; It is a penal Statute, and therefore ſhall
be taken ſtrictly, <hi>Stamford 129 b. C. 11. part 36 b.</hi> The Statute of 5 &amp;
<hi>6 E.</hi> 6. takes away Clergy; but if a ſtranger be in the houſe by licence
of the Owner, the party ſhall have his Clergy, becauſe out of the words,
and being a penal Law, it ſhall be taken ſtrictly. The Statute of 33 <hi>H. 8.
cap.</hi> 20. forfeits for Treaſon Right to the Land, <hi>viz.</hi> right of Entry;
but the Statute of 26 <hi>H</hi> 8. giveth not any Right. Before the Statute of
<hi>33 H.</hi> 8. a right of Entry was not given to the King for Treaſon; <hi>à


fortiori</hi> a right of Action was not forfeited to the King. It is the Statute
of 31 <hi>H.</hi> 8. the private Act which hurteth us, which expreſly gave Rights:
But this Right in our Caſe is not forfeited by this Statute, which giveth
Rights which a man hath; But in our Caſe <hi>Francis Bigot</hi> had not the
Right, but the Right was in abeyance. Statutes in points of Forfeiture
forfeit no more then a man hath: But yet a Statute may give to the
King that which a man hath not. <hi>C. 11. part</hi> 13. The ſtatute of <hi>Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries</hi>
gave that to the King which was not, <hi>viz.</hi> Monaſteries in reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ſaving to none but ſtrangers, no not to the Donors. <hi>Huſſies</hi> Caſe:
Tenant in tail doth bargain and ſell to the King; and a ſtatute gave it
to the King, ſaving to ſtrangers; but neither the Donor nor his iſſue
were within the ſaving. <hi>Old Entries, 423. b, c, d.</hi> It was enacted, That
the Duke of <hi>Suffolk</hi> ſhould forfeit for Treaſon all his Lands, Rights,
and Tenements, and all ſuch Rights and Titles of Entry which he had:
But thereby rights of Action were not given to the King, but only rights
of Entries. The ſtatutes of 31 &amp; 33 <hi>H.</hi> 8. are alike in words: If Tenant
in tail, the Remainder over, forfeit &amp;c. the Remainder is ſaved without
words of ſaving: But if the ſtatute giveth the land by name unto the
King, then the Remainder is not ſaved, but is deſtroyed. If a Right of
Action be given unto the King, the ſtatutes of Limitation and Fines are
deſtroyed, for he is not bound by them. <hi>C.</hi> 485, 486. in point of forfeiture,
<hi>Stamf.</hi> 187, 188. There is a difference betwixt real and perſonal Rights
given to the King. <hi>C. 3. part</hi> 3. A right of Action concerning Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances
are not forfeited by Attaindor, &amp;c. But Obligations, Statutes &amp;c.
are forfeited by Attaindor. <hi>C. 7. part</hi> 9. A right of Action is not given
to the King by general words of an Act, becauſe it lieth in privity, And
it would be a vexation to the ſubject if they ſhould be given. <hi>C. 4. pt.</hi> 124.
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:40982:158"/>
Although that a <hi>Non compos mentis</hi> cannot commit Felony; yet he may
commit Treaſon; for the King is <hi>Caput &amp; ſalus reipublicae.</hi> If <hi>Non
compos mentis</hi> maketh a Feoffment, and then committeth Treaſon, the
King ſhall not have an Action to recover the Land of the <hi>Non compos
mentis,</hi> as the party himſelf may have: But if <hi>Non compos mentis</hi> be
diſſeiſed, and then be attainted of Treaſon, then the King may enter into
the Lands, becauſe the party himſelf had a right of Entry which is given
to the King.</p>
            <p>It was objected, That a right of Action clothed with a poſſeſſion
might be given to the King. Tenant in tail diſcontinues, and takes back
an eſtate, and is attainted of Treaſon: This right of Action ſhall not
be forfeited to the King, for his right of Action was to the eſtate tail.
In our Caſe the right of Action was to <hi>Katherine,</hi> for ſhe was Tenant
for life. The Attaindor was 29 <hi>H</hi> 8. and the Act which forfeited the
Right was made 31 <hi>H.</hi> 8. and then the right and poſſeſſion were divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
<hi>30 H. 6. Grants</hi> 91. The King may grant the Temporalties of a
Biſhop before they happen to be void, And ſo he may grant a Ward:
But the King cannot grant the Lands of <hi>J. S.</hi> when he ſhall be attainted
of Treaſon; for the Law doth not preſume that <hi>J. S.</hi> will commit Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
The Deviſe of a Term, the Remainder over is good: But if the
Deviſe be of a Term to one in tail, the Remainder over, the Remainder is
void, becauſe the Law doth preſume that an eſtate in tail may continue
for ever. <hi>C. 8. part</hi> 165, 166. The Law did not preſume that <hi>Digby</hi> at
the time of the Conveyance intended to commit Treaſon.</p>
            <p>It was objected, That whatſoever may be granted, may be forfeited: I
deny that, <hi>C. 3. part</hi> 10. by <hi>Lumley's</hi> Caſe: If the iſſue in tail in the
life of his Father be attainted of high Treaſon and dyeth, it is no for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture
of the eſtate tail: But if the iſſue in tail levieth a Fine in the life
of his Father, it is a bar to his iſſues. <hi>C. 3. part</hi> 50. Sir <hi>George Brown's</hi>
Caſe, 10 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 1. there Executors may give away the goods of the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtator,
but they cannot forfeit the goods of their Teſtator. <hi>Com. 293.
Osborns</hi> Caſe, Guardian in Soccage may grant the Ward, but he cannot
forfeit him. <hi>C. 3. part</hi> 3. Right of Actions reals, becauſe they are in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
by general words of a Statute, are not given to the King, <hi>v. Dyer 67.
String fellow's</hi> Caſe: That which is in <hi>cuſtodia Legis</hi> cannot be taken

            <p>The third Point is, If he were remitted; And I conceive that he was

ſhall take away entrie; But in our Caſe <hi>Ratcliff</hi> had both poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and right, and therefore is remitted; the ſpeciall Verdict finds that
he was remitted, and the Judgment given in the Court of Pleas in the
Exchequer was, that he was remitted. It was objected, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitter
was deſtroyed by the relation of the Office; but the ſame is not
ſo, for the Office relates only to avoid Incombrances, <hi>viz.</hi> acts done by
himſelf: but to deveſt the Freehold, and to ſettle the ſame in the King,
the Office ſhall not relate: And if it ſhould relate, then the King ſhould
loſe many Lands which he now hath: <hi>Com. Nichols</hi> Caſe. Tenant for
life upon condition to have Fee &amp;c. If the Office ſhall relate, then the
ſame takes away the Freehold out of the perſon attainted, <hi>à principio.</hi>
and then the Fee cannot accrue; and ſo by that means the King ſhould
loſe the lands. A Remitter is no incombrance, for it is an ancient right,
and the Act of the King cannot do wrong. <hi>C. 1. part 44. b. 27 Aſſ.
30.</hi> There Tenant for life with clauſe of re-entrie is attainted the reverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner
entreth, the Office ſhall not relate to take the Freehold out of the

a third perſon; and the Office found in the life of <hi>Katherine</hi> ſhal
not prejudice him, <hi>C. 9. part, Beamounts</hi> Caſe; the husband and wife
are Tenants in tail, the husband is attainted of Treaſon and dyeth, yet
the wife is tenant in tail, when it is not to the damage or prejudice of
the King, there <hi>tempus occurrit Regi: C. 7. part 28. Baskervile's</hi> Caſe.
From 29 <hi>H.</hi> 8. untill 33 <hi>H. 8. Katherine;</hi> and afterwards <hi>Ratcliff</hi> had
the poſſeſſion; and then the Law was taken to be, that <hi>Ratcliff</hi> had a
lawfull poſſeſſion. For theſe reaſons he concluded, that the Judgment
ought to be affirmed.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Trinity</hi> Term following, <hi>viz. Trin. 21. Jacobi Regis,</hi> the Caſe was
argued again: and then <hi>Coventry</hi> the Kings Attorney general, argued
for the Lord <hi>Sheffield,</hi> That the Judgment given in the Court of Pleas
in the Exchequer, ought to be reverſed. He ſaid, I will inſiſt only upon
the right of the Caſe, Whether upon the right of the Caſe <hi>Ratcliff</hi> may
maintain a <hi>Monſtrans de Droit.</hi> Firſt, If by the Attainder, the right of
the old Eſtate tail, as well as of the new Eſtate tail be forfeited: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
Admitting that the old right of entail be not forfeited, then if the
Office do overreach the Remitter, for then a <hi>Monſtrans de Droit</hi> doth
not lie, but a Petition for the reaſon of the diſcontinuance: Firſt it is
evident, that when <hi>Ralph Bigot</hi> Tenant in tail in poſſeſſion 6 <hi>H.</hi> 8. made<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
a Feoffment, that that was a diſcontinuance, and it is as clear that the
right of the old Eſtate tail veſted in <hi>Francis Bigot.</hi> The Feoffment
made by <hi>Francis Bigot, 21 H.</hi> 8. did not deveſt the right of the old tail:
Firſt for the weakneſſe of the Feoffment; Secondly for the inſeparable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Eſtate tail, which is incommunicable, and not to be diſpla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by weak aſſurance. That Feoffment was made according to the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of 1 <hi>R.</hi> 3. and not by the Common Law, but only by force of the
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:40982:159"/>
ſaid Statute. The Feoffment is without Deed, and ſo nothing paſſeth
but only by way of Livery, or elſe nothing at all. Alſo at the time of
the Feoffment in 21 <hi>H.</hi> 8. the Feoffees were in ſeiſin of the Lands; and
<hi>Ratcliff</hi> ſhews in his <hi>Monſtrans de Droit,</hi> that <hi>Francis Bigot</hi> did diſſeiſe
the Feoffees, and ſo the Feoffment had no force as a Feoffment at the
Common Law, but only by the Statute of 1 <hi>R.</hi> 3. For at the Common-Law,
if <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe</hi> had entred upon the Feoffees, and made a Feoff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
nothing had paſſed. There is a difference betwixt a Feoffment
at the Common Law, and a Feoffment according to the Statute of 1 <hi>R.
3.</hi> which operates <hi>ſub modo</hi> Feoffments are the ancient Conveyances of
Lands, but Feoffments according to the Statute of 1 <hi>R.</hi> 3. are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtarts
and have not had continuance above 150 years. In caſe of Feoff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
at the Common Law, the Feoffor ought to be ſeiſed of the lands
at the time of the Feoffment; but if a Feoffment be according to the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of 1 <hi>R.</hi> 3. in ſuch Caſe the Feoffor needeth not be in poſſeſſion:
Feoffments at the Common Law give away both Eſtates and Rights;
but Feoffments by the Statute of <hi>R.</hi> 3, give the Eſtates, but not the
Rights. In caſe of Feoffment at the Common Law, the Feoffee is in
the <hi>Per, viz.</hi> by the Feoffor; but in caſe of Feoffments by the Statute of
<hi>R.</hi> 3. the Feoffees are in in the <hi>Poſt, viz</hi> by the firſt Feoffees, 14 <hi>H. 8
10. Brudnel</hi> ſays, that a Feoffment by <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe</hi> by the Statute of
<hi>1 R. 3, is like to fire out of a flint, ſo as all the fire which cometh out of the
flint will not faſten upon any thing but tinder or gunpowder:</hi> So a Feoff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe</hi> by force of the Statute of 1 <hi>R.</hi> 3, will not faſten
upon any thing but what the Statute requires, 5 <hi>H. 7. 5. 21 H. 7. 25.
8 H. 7, 8. 27 H.</hi> 8. 13. 23. by theſe books it appeareth, that if <hi>Ceſtuy
que uſe</hi> maketh a Leafe for life, during the Leaſe he gaines nothing, and
after the Leaſe he gains no reverſion; for the Leſſee ſhall hold of the
Feoffees, and of them he ſhall have aid, and unleſs it be by deed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dented,
in ſuch a Caſe a Reſervation of Rent is void, and the Leſſor in
ſuch a Caſe cannot puniſh the Leſſee for waſte; for he makes the Leaſe
meerly by the power which the Statute gives him. 8. <hi>H. 7. 9. Ceſtuy que

but good by the Statute of 1 <hi>R.</hi> 3. during his own life. And if in ſuch
caſe Proclamations paſs, there needeth no claim nor entrie within five
years; but the Law is contrarie of Tenant for life by the Common
Law: for if Tenant for life at the Common Law levieth a fine, it is a
forfeiture. <hi>Dyer 57. Ceſtuy que uſe</hi> for life or in tail, maketh a Leaſe
for life, the Leaſe is determined by the death of <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe,</hi> and the
Leſſee is become Tenant at ſufferance; but a Leaſe for life by Tenant
for life at the Common Law, is not determined by the death of Leſſee
for life who was Leſſor, and his Tenant is tenant for life, and not at ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferance,
as in the Caſe before, and the firſt Leſſor ought to avoid it by
entrie. <hi>Br.</hi> Feoffments to Uſes 48. A Recovery by <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe</hi> in tail
or in fee, is ended by his death.</p>
            <p>By theſe Caſes appears a main difference betwixt the validitie of a
Feoffment by <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe,</hi> and the Feoffment at the Common Law:
The Statute of 27 H. 8. of Uſes, doth not execute Uſes which are in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyance,
<hi>C. 1. part, Chudleigh's</hi> Caſe 9 H. 6. by the Common Law, the
Deviſe to an Enfant <hi>in ventre ſamier</hi> is good but by the Statutes of 32,

our Caſe, was not made to a man <hi>in Nubibus. Ceſtuy que uſe</hi> by this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute

            <p>There is a common Rule, That a Warranty doth not bind when a
man hath not a right: The Caſes cited in <hi>C. 1. part, Albonies</hi> Caſe,
where Feoffments give Rights, I agree. <hi>Barton</hi> and <hi>Ewers</hi> Caſe, A man
made a Feoffment of Land, of which he had cauſe to have a Writ of
Error, he gave away his Writ of Error by the Feoffment; I agree all
thoſe Caſes, for that is in Caſes of Feoffments at the Common Law;
but in our Caſe the Feoffment is by the Statute of 1 <hi>R.</hi> 3. In our Caſe
there is <hi>Jus habendi, poſſedendi, &amp; recuperandi:</hi> It is like unto a plant in
Winter, which ſeemeth to be dead, yet there is in it <hi>anima vegitativa,</hi>
which in due time brings forth fruit: So the right in our Caſe is not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
away, nor is it in abeyance, but in <hi>Francis Bigot,</hi> which may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gained
in due time. <hi>Dyer</hi> 340. there was <hi>Scintilla juris,</hi> as here in our
Caſe. 19 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 7. Where Tenant in tail maketh a Feoffment, and the
Feoffee levieth a fine, and five years paſs, there it is ſaid that the Iſſue in
tail ſhall have five years after the death of Tenant in tail who made the
Feoffment; and the reaſon is, becauſe he is the firſt to whom the right
doth diſcend. This Caſe was objected againſt me: yet I anſwer, that
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:40982:160"/>
Tenant in tail in that Caſe hath right, but he cannot claim it by reaſon
of his own Feoffment; he cannot ſay he hath right, but another may
ſay he hath right.</p>
            <p>In our Caſe <hi>Francis Bigot</hi> cannot ſay he hath a Right in him, but an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
may ſay he hath a Right. It is like where Tenant in Fee taketh a
Leaſe for years by Deed Indented of his own Lands; He, during the
years cannot ſay that he hath Fee, yet all other may ſay that he hath the
Fee. <hi>C. 4. part</hi> 127. The King ſhall avoid the Feoffment for the benefit
of a <hi>Lunatique,</hi> which Feoffment the <hi>Lunatique</hi> had made; and ſhall
not the King avoid a Feoffment which a <hi>Lunatique</hi> hath made, for his
own benefit, <hi>viz</hi> for the benefit of the King himſelf? I conceive that
he ſhall. Secondly, Admit the right be in the perſon, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>Francis
Bigot;</hi> yet they object that it is a right of Action, and ſo not forfeited.
If this right be in the perſon at the time of the Attainder, it ſhall be
forfeited; if it be not in his perſon, but in <hi>Nubibus,</hi> yet it ſhall be forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
Tenant in tail makes a Feoffment unto the uſe of himſelf and his
wife in tail<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if the old right of entail reſt, or not, in his perſon, it is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited

Tenant in tail before the Statute of 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. of Uſes, made a Feoffment
unto the uſe of himſelf and his wife in tail. It was reſolved upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
deliberation by all the Judges of <hi>England,</hi> that the old Eſtate tail
was in ſuch caſe forfeited for Treaſon. Set this Judgment aſide, yet it
reſts upon the Statute of 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. A general Act for forfeiture for
Treaſon, and the particular Act of 31 <hi>H.</hi> 8. which was made for the
particular Attaindor of <hi>Francis Bigot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will argue argue only upon the Statute 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. which hath three
clauſes. Firſt, to take away Sanctuary; Secondly, to provide that no
Treaſon be committed, and the Offender puniſhed; The third, which
clauſe I am to deal with, which giveth the forfeiture of Lands of Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance,
&amp;c Theſe three clauſes do depend upon the Preamble. It was
high time to make this Statute: For when <hi>H.</hi> 8. excluded the Pope, he
was to ſtand upon his guard: And that year of 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. there were
five ſeveral Inſurrections againſt the King, therefore it was great wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to bridle ſuch perſons: King <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. and Queen <hi>Mary</hi> repealed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Statutes for Treaſon and Felony, yet left this Statute of 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8.
to ſtand in force. <hi>Anno 5 E. 6. cap.</hi> 5. this Statute of 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
too ſtrict was in part repealed, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Church lands ſhould
not be forfeited for the Treaſon of the Parſon. This third branch doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt

in the Statute, ſhall <hi>(Forfeit)</hi> thoſe things which are forfeitable, and

right, title or means: So you have Eſtate, Right, Title and Uſe.
Here <hi>Francis Bigot</hi> ſhal forfeit the Caſtle and Mannor of <hi>Mulgrave</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

Right<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Title and Uſe, otherwiſe it cannot be to the King for ever; and
what is ſaved to ſtrangers, all ſhall be ſaved; and what will you not
ſave to the Offender and his heirs, all his Lands, Right, &amp;c. as was ſaved
to ſtrangers.</p>
            <p>It was objected, that it was not an Act of Aſſurance, but an Act of
Forfeiture, which is not ſo ſtrong as an Act of Aſſurance. I do not
doubt of the difference; but how much will that difference make to
this Caſe? doth the Statute goe by way of Eſcheat? it doth not; but
in caſe of Petty Treaſon Land ſhall Eſcheat; but when the Statute of
<hi>25 E.</hi> 3. ſpeaketh of High Treaſon, the words of the ſaid Statute are,
Shall forfeit the Eſcheat to the King: But is the Right devided from the
King? Truely no; the word <hi>(Forfeit)</hi> take it in <hi>nomine,</hi> or in <hi>natura,</hi>
is as ſtrong a word, as any word of Aſſurance. <hi>Alienare</hi> in the Statute
of <hi>Weſt. 2. cap. 1. Non habeant illi poteſtatem alienandi;</hi> ſo <hi>non habent illi
poteſtatem forisfaciendi,</hi> is in the nature of a Gift. <hi>Com.</hi> 260. Forfeiture
is a gift in Law, <hi>Et fortior eſt diſpoſitio legis quam hominis,</hi> and ſo as
ſtrong as any aſſurance of the partie., If a Statute give the Land
to the King, then there needeth not any Office, 27 <hi>H. 8. Br. Office. Com.

<hi>26 H<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 8. doth not extend to a right of Action, but to a right of Entrie.
The purpoſe of this Act of 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. is not to attaint any particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
as the Statute of 31 <hi>H.</hi> 8. was made for the particular Attaindor
of <hi>Francis Bigot. 5 E. 4. 7. Ceſtuy que uſe</hi> at the Common Law, did
not forfeit for Felony or Treaſon; but by this Act of 26. <hi>H. 8. Ceſtuy
que uſe</hi> ſhall forfeit both Uſe and Lands, out of the hands of the Feof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fees.
<hi>4 E. 3. 47. 4 Aſſ.</hi> 4. The husband ſeiſed in the right of his wife
at the Common Law for Treaſon ſhall not forfeit but the profits of the
lands of his wife during his life, and not the Freehold it ſelf; but by
this Act of 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. the Freehold it ſelf is forfeited. 18 <hi>Eliz.</hi> in the

Rules of the Common Law, nor by any Statute can a right of Action

may be quaſhed, and exonerated, and diſcharged in the poſſeſſion of the
King. For it is out of the Rule which is in <hi>C. 10, part</hi> 48, for the cauſe
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:40982:161"/>
of quieting and repoſe of the Terre-Tenants, otherwiſe it would be a

of Suits and Controverſies, be releaſed to the Terre-Tennants. By
the ſame reaſon here the right of Action of <hi>Francis Bigot</hi> ſhall be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
and exonerated by this forfeiture, <hi>viz.</hi> for the quiet and repoſe
of the Terre-Tenants; for the Law delights in the quiet and repoſe of
the Terre-Tenants. If <hi>Francis Bigot</hi> had granted a Rent, the ancient
right of the tail had been charged. <hi>C. 7. part</hi> 14. Where Tenant in tail
makes a leaſe for life, and grants a Rent charge, and Tenant for life di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
he ſhall not avoid his charge, although he be in of another Eſtate,
becauſe he had a defeiſible poſſeſſion, and an ancient right, the which,
&amp;c. ſo as they could not be <hi>ſevered</hi> by way of conveyance and charge,
and no lawfull act; Then I admire how he will ſever this from himſelf

If a man commit Treaſon, he ſhall forfeit the Dower of his wife, yet he
doth not give the dower of his wife, but it goes by way of diſcharge in

cannot grant his Eſtate of Tenant by the Curteſie to another, but yet
he for Felony or Treaſon may forfeit it, <hi>viz.</hi> by way of diſcharge. A
Keeper of a Park commits Treaſon, there the King ſhall not have the
Office of Keeper for a forfeiture, becauſe it is an Office of truſt; but if
he had been Keeper of the Kings Park, and had been attainted, there he
ſhould forfeit his Office by way of diſcharge and exoneration. This

in the King, the Tenant makes a Leaſe for years and dies, the iſſue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
of the Rent, and commits Treaſon, the Leaſe is avoided, for the
King is not in by forfeiture by the Statute of 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. but by way of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veter
by the Statute of 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. It was objected, that if Tenant in
tail maketh a Feoffment, and takes back an Eſtate for life, and is attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of Treaſon, that he ſhall not forfeit his old right, I agree that Caſe:
For indeed it is out of the Statute of 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. which ſpeaks of Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance,
and in that Caſe the Tenant hath but a Freehold. The Statute
of 26 <hi>H<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 8. ſaith, that it ſhall be forfeited to the King, his heirs and
Succeſſors; And if in our Caſe the old right ſhould remain, then it
ſhould be a forfeiture but during the life of the Teſtator. When the
Common Law, or Statute Law giveth Lands, it gives the means to keep
them, as the Evidences; So here the King is to have by force of this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. the Evidences. The forfeiture of right is expreſly
within the Statute of 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. as the forfeiture of Eſtate, as by any
right, title or means, for the old Eſtate tail is the means of Eſtates ſince
<hi>6 H.</hi> 8. And if you will take away the Foundation, the Building will
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:40982:162"/>
fall: For all the Eſtates are drawn out of the old Eſtate tail. The Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute

be any expreſs Saving. I anſwer, that there are divers Statutes of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feitures:
yet the Statutes have Savings in them, ſo as it ſeems a ſaving
in ſuch Acts were not ſuperfluous, but neceſſary. The Act of 33 <hi>H.</hi> 8.

yet an Act of Forfeiture. <hi>Dyer</hi> 100. there the land veſted in him in the

and then the Statute of 26 H. 8. came: now whether the Forfeiture
for Treaſon ſhould be taken away from the Biſhop, by reaſon of that
Statute, and given to the King, was the doubt? It was holden, that of
new Treaſons the Biſhop ſhould not have the Forfeitures, for thoſe
were not at the Common Law, as the Forfeitures of Tenant in tail; but
that he ſhould have the Forfeitures of Lands in Fee within his Dioceſe;
and that he had by force of the ſaving in the Statute; ſo that a Saving
is neceſſary and operative. <hi>Com. Nichols's</hi> Caſe, there <hi>Harpers</hi> opinion,

Treaſon, then the King ſhall avoid the Leaſe. So a Statute of Forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

               <hi>Vide C. 9. part. Beaumont's</hi> Caſe: Land is given to husband and wife
in tail, and the husband is attainted of Treaſon; the wife is then Tenant
in tail, yet the Land is forfeited againſt the iſſue, although it be but a
poſſibility for the whole eſtate is in the wife; but the cauſe thereof is,
becauſe it was once coupled with a poſſeſſion. <hi>C. 7. part, Nevils</hi> Caſe,
There was a queſtion whether an Earldom might be entailed and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited
for Treaſon, which is a thing which he hath not in poſſeſſion nor
uſe, but is inherent in the blood: And there reſolved that the ſame can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be forfeited as to be transferred to the King, but it is forfeited by
way of diſcharge and exoneration. 12 <hi>Eliz. Dyer,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi>
Caſe: There, if it had not been for the <hi>ſaving,</hi> the Regal Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
of the Biſhop had been given to the King by the Statute of <hi>26
H.</hi> 8. This Statute of 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. was made for the dread of the Traitor:
For the times paſt ſaw how dangerous Traitors were, who did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
their lives, ſo as their lands might diſcend to their iſſue; It was
then deſperate for the King, Prince, and Subject; For the time to come
it was worſe. The Law doth not preſume that a man would commit ſo
horrid an act as Treaſon: ſo it was cited by Mr. <hi>Crook,</hi> who cited the
caſe, That the King cannot grant the goods and lands of one when he
ſhall be attainted of Treaſon, becauſe the Law doth not preſume that he
will commit Treaſon: If the Law will not preſume it, wherefore then
were the Statutes made againſt it? If the Land be forfeited by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. much ſtronger is it by the Statute of 31 <hi>H.</hi> 8. But
then admit there were a Remitter in the Caſe, yet by the Office found
the ſame is defeated: Without Office the Right is in the King, <hi>Com.
486. c. 5. part</hi> 52 where it is ſaid, There are two manner of Offices, the
one which veſts the eſtate and poſſeſſion of the Land &amp;c. in the King,
where he had but a Right, as in the caſe of Attaindor the Right is in the
King by the Act of Parliament, and relates by the Office. <hi>Com.</hi> 488.
That an Office doth relate. 38 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 31. The King ſhall have the mean
profits. The Office found was found in 33 <hi>Eliz.</hi> and the ſame is to put
the King in by the force of the Attaindor which was 29 <hi>H.</hi> 8. and ſo the
ſame deveſts the Remitter. Tenant in tail levieth a Fine, and diſſeiſeth
the Conuſee and dyeth, the iſſue is remitted, then proclamations paſs;
now the Fine doth deveſt the Remitter. <hi>C. 1. part</hi> 47 Tenant in tail
ſuffereth a common Recovery, and dyeth before Execution; the iſſue

found that the Diſſeiſor was ſeiſed, the Remitter is taken out of the
Diſſeiſee: which is a ſtronger caſe then our Caſe; for there was a right
of Entire, and in our Caſe it is but a right of Action, which is not ſo

ſwayed the even ballance before, and made the opinion the greater

and ſhewed how that he kept ſo many Kyne, <hi>viz.</hi> 20, &amp;c. with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the ſaid Pariſh, and that he did tender <hi>apud Landone</hi> ſo many Cheeſes
at <hi>Michaelmas</hi> to <hi>Denham</hi> the Defendant, being Parſon, who refuſed
them, and to take them away, but ſuffered them to be and continue in

did demur upon the Declaration. <hi>George Crook,</hi> the Action
will lie; for the Plaintiffe hath a damage, by reaſon that the Parſon
doth not take away his Tythe-Cheeſe. And it is like unto the Caſe in
<hi>13 H. 4. Action ſur le</hi> Caſe 48. Where a man ſold unto another Hay,
and becauſe that the Vendee took not away his Hay, an Action upon
the Caſe did lie, for it was a damage to the Plaintiffe to let it ſtand upon

they ſhould eat the Hay and ſpoil it, and ſo he ſhould be lyable to an
Action to be brought by the Vendee: So if Tythe be lawfully ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>forth,
and the Parſon refuſeth the Tythe, but will ſue in the Spiritual
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:40982:165"/>
Court for the Tythe, an Action upon the Caſe will lie: <hi>à fortiori</hi> in this
Caſe, for the Cheeſes may be cumberſome and troubleſome to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
ſo as he cannot make the beſt uſe or benefit of his houſe. <hi>Paul Crook<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
contrarie: and he took exception becauſe the tender is alledged to be
<hi>apud Landone,</hi> and it is not ſhewed that it was at his houſe at <hi>Landone,</hi>
or in any place certain; and he ſaid that the Action will not lie, becauſe
here is no damage to the Plaintiffe: and it is like the Caſe when a man
makes a Leaſe rendring Rent, Cheeſe, or Corn, and the Tenant tendreth
it, and the Leſſor refuſeth it; the Leſſee cannot have an Action upon the
Caſe againſt his Leſſor, but he may plead the matter in barr, in an Action
brought by the Leſſor. And the Caſe of 13 <hi>H.</hi> 4. before put, is not
to the purpoſe, for there it was part of the Bargain to take it away by
ſuch a time: And in our Caſe the Plaintiffe may plead the matter in
barr to the Plaint'. 43 <hi>Eliz.</hi> betwixt <hi>Criſpe</hi> and <hi>Jackson,</hi> an Action
upon the Caſe was brought for ſuing in the Eccleſiatical Court for
Tythes which were due, and he recovered damages.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Admit that the Action doth lie, then it is becauſe it is a da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
unto him that they remain in his houſe; but it doth not appear
that the tender was made at his houſe, but <hi>apud Landone,</hi> which might
be a mile from the houſe; and ſo becauſe it was his own fault, the Action
will not lie as this Caſe is, by reaſon of the tender. <hi>George Crook,</hi> It was
adjudged in a <hi>Corniſh</hi> Caſe, that an Action upon the Caſe lieth againſt a
Parſon which doth not take away his Tythe corn, or hay, becauſe it
ſpoyles the ground upon which it ſtands, and becauſe the partie cannot
have the free uſe of his Land: So in our Caſe, he cannot have the free
a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e of his houſe, the cheeſes cumbring his houſe, and offending him
with their ſmell. <hi>Haughton</hi> Juſtice, If the Action were well laid, it
would lie for the Cauſe, but in this Caſe it is not well laid: If any thing
makes the Action to lie, it is the damage which the Plaintiffe doth
ſuſtain by the cheeſes being in his houſe; but here it is laid to be tendred
<hi>apud Landone,</hi> and it is not ſaid at his houſe, and <hi>non conſtat</hi> how the
cheeſes came to his houſe; for if they were brought back by the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffe,
or by his commandment, then the Action will not lie; but if he
had laid his Action, that he gave notice to the Parſon that he had ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
cheeſes ready for him for his Tythe, and had required him to ſend
for them, then if the Parſon had not carried them away, the Action
would have lien; but for the reaſon before the Action as it is laid is not
maintainable. <hi>Dodderidge</hi> Juſtice, There are two matters in this caſe:
Firſt, If the Action will lie for the matter. Secondly, If the Action
will lie by reaſon of the Tender: as to the firſt, I put this difference,
That in ſome caſe it will lie, and in ſome caſe it will not lie; in this caſe
the Action is not maintainable.</p>
            <p>Where a tender is of a thing which the Partie ought to have, by the
tender the property is changed; and there a damage may ariſe by reaſon
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:40982:165"/>
that he will not take it away, as in the caſe of 13 <hi>H.</hi> 4. put before;
there the Plaintiffe had damage by the ſtanding of the hay upon the
ground, for he could not put in his cattel, for then he might be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of an Action, becauſe the cattel might eat the hay.</p>
            <p>If one ſetteth forth his Tythe, and the Parſon having notice thereof
will not take it away, an Action lyeth, becauſe it as a damage to the
Land: But in our Caſe, admit the tender were at his houſe, yet this ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
doth not alter the Property in the perſon, and they being his own
cheeſes, he hath no loſs; ſo the difference is, where the partie hath da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
and loſs, and where he hath none, as here in our Caſe he hath no
damage; the tender of the Rent ſaves from the penaltie, but doth not
diſcharge the dutie; but admit that the Action will lie, yet in this Caſe
the Declaration is inſufficient, For the tender is not alledged to be at
any place certain in the Village, for it may be that he tendred them to
the Parſon in the Church-yard of <hi>Landone,</hi> and then by the carrying of
them home to his houſe again, he hath loſt the Action which he might
have had if he had tendred them at his houſe. <hi>Ley</hi> Chief Juſtice, There
is a difference in the caſe of Tenders: If I tender ſuch a thing which
is due, and the other refuſeth it, and I muſt pay the ſame thing in kinde,
if by the keeping of it I be endamaged, I may have an Action upon the
Caſe: and that is our Caſe.</p>
            <p>If a man ſetteth out his Tythe hay, or Corn (the tender in our Caſe
is a ſetting forth of the Tythe Cheeſe) and the Parſon refuſeth to take
it away, and it periſh in keeping, I am excuſed for the periſhing of it;
but I may have an Action againſt the Parſon, for letting it ſtay upon my
Land to my anoyance. So if <hi>A.</hi> commit goods to me to keep in my
houſe, and I require him to take them away and he refuſeth to do it, I
may have an Action upon the Caſe againſt him, for it is a trouble to me
to remove them for him: and ſo in our Caſe; but it is otherwiſe where
I pay Rent-Corn, and the Leſſor doth refuſe it, I may pay him in other
corn. If one be to pay ſo much corn, and the other will not receive
it being tendred unto him, untill it be dearer, an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ction upon the Caſe
will lie, for he is thereby endamaged. In our Caſe the partie is damni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
for his houſe is anoyed by the ſmell, and alſo encombred therewith,
and the rooms of his houſe are valuable, and he cannot make uſe of
them at his pleaſure: the Tender ought to be, where by the ordinary
courſe the thing hath its beeing: As at the place of the ſhearing of the
Sheep, the Parſon is to demand his Tythe wool, and there it is to be paid,
if there be be a perſon who hath power to deliver it; the things which
are ordinarily in the houſe, as butter, cheeſe, &amp;c. are to be tendred
there, and there they are to be demanded, and thereof notice is to be
given to the Parſon; and the partie is not bound to carry them to the
Parſons houſe. The cheeſes which are to be paid by this Cuſtom, are to
be paid of cheeſes made upon that Land, and not of cheeſes which the
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:40982:166"/>
Pariſhoner ſhall buy elſewhere: The tender is alledged to be in the
Town of <hi>Landone,</hi> and the Law intends the cheeſes to be in the Pariſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
houſe and this general tender is to be underſtood at the place where
the cheeſes by intendment of Law are to be; and on the other ſide it
ought to be alledged, that the tender was not at the houſe: ſo as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that the tender is good. <hi>Dodderidge,</hi> The intendment is not good
in this caſe; for in every Declaration there ought to be certainty and
verity; but in a plea in bar, there if it be a common intendment, it is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient.
If a man ſpeak generally of a Town, it is to be meant at the
Hamlet where the Church ſtands. <hi>Ley,</hi> when a tender is pleaded, it is
ſuppoſed to be at the place where the tender ought to be by the Law. As
a man is bound to pay money, if he plead that he tendred it at <hi>D.</hi> it
ſhall be intended that <hi>D.</hi> is the place where it ought to be paid. If the
partie goeth to the Parſons houſe, and tells the Parſon that he hath at his
houſe ſuch Tythe cheeſes for him, and requires the Parſon to ſend for
them; here the notification is at the Parſons houſe, but the real tender is at
the parties own houſe: And the partie plaintiffe in our Caſe cannot
plead it otherwiſe then at <hi>Landone. Haughton,</hi> In this caſe the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
a ſpecial place of tender expreſſed, or elſe he ſhews no cauſe of
Action: For if it were at any place out of his houſe, the Action will

If I tender to one a marriage, or a Ward, the woman, or Ward ought
to be preſent at the time of the tender. Tender of money in a bag, as
to ſay, I have money for you, is no good tender: and ſo it is of cheeſes;
to ſay, I have cheeſes for you, is but a verbal tender, and it is not good;
but it ought to be tendred perſonally and in kinde. You will intend
that the Parſon was at the plaintiffs houſe at the time of this tender, and
here is nothing in the caſe to direct you ſo to think. <hi>Ley,</hi> The place is but
circumſtance, for the Parſon is tyed to demand them at the houſe, being
the proper place of tender, by reaſon of their being there. <hi>Dodderidge,</hi>
The cheeſe muſt be ſhewed the Parſon, and that proves that he muſt be
preſent: <hi>Ley,</hi> If he were preſent, then the tender is good: But if he be
not there, but at another place, the notice is ſufficient <hi>Dodderidge,</hi> The
Law requires certainty in a Declaration, and the matter cannot be taken
by intendment; ſo we ought to have a certainty ſet forth, otherwiſe
no certain Judgment can be given. It was adjourned, for <hi>Dodderidge</hi> and

            <p>A Man made a Leaſe for life, and covenanted for him and his heirs,
That he would ſave the Leſſee harmleſs from any claiming by, from

<hi>A.</hi> paid unto the Parſon ten ſhillings, which the Parſon accepted of;
And made <hi>B.</hi> an Enfant his Executor, and dyed. The mother of the
Enfant took Letters of Adminiſtration <hi>durante minori aetate</hi> of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant,
and made a Leaſe at Will of the Lands. The Parſon libelled in the
Eccleſiaſtical Court for Tythes of the ſame Lands againſt the Tenant at
Will; who thereupon moved for a Prohibition. <hi>Dodderidge,</hi> During
the life of the Parſon the Contract is a foot; but the Aſſignee cannot

<hi>Killigrew</hi> was not ready to pay the 2000<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. and that the Lady and her
Son were not ready to aſſure the land. The Agreement was (for which
not time is expreſſed) That the Lady and her Son ſhould convey ſuch

LANE'S Caſe.</head>
            <p>AN Action of Debt was brought upon a Bond for not performance
of Covenants. The Caſe was: <hi>Lane</hi> did marry with the daughter
of <hi>Gorge;</hi> and in conſideration of marriage, and alſo of 3000l. portion
given in marriage by <hi>Gorge, Lane</hi> did covenant, That he within one year
would make a Jointure of lands within <hi>England</hi> then of the value of
500l. <hi>per annum</hi> over and above all Repriſes, to his ſaid wife, ſo as Sir
<hi>Henry Yelverton</hi> and Sir <hi>John Walter</hi> Councellors at Law ſhould deviſe
and adviſe. In Debt for the breach of theſe Covenants, <hi>Lane</hi> pleaded,
That he did inform <hi>Gorge</hi> of lands which he was determined ſhould be
for her Jointure, but neither <hi>Yelverton</hi> nor <hi>Walter</hi> did deviſe the Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.
<hi>Paul Crook</hi> did demur upon the Plea; and firſt ſhewed, That
<hi>Lane</hi> did not give notice to <hi>Yelverton</hi> and <hi>Walter,</hi> as he ought to have
done by law: For in this caſe it is not ſufficient to give notice to <hi>Gorge,</hi>
but the notice ought to be to the Councellors, otherwiſe how could
they deviſe the aſſurance for her jointure? 2. Heer is no place named
where the Notice was, for it is iſſuable whether he gave Notice or not;
and then there being no certain place named, no <hi>viſne</hi> can be upon it.
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:40982:169"/>
3. He doth not ſhew where the Lands are; for it might be (as in truth it
was) the Lands were out of <hi>England,</hi> and by the Covenant they ought
to be within <hi>England.</hi> 4. He doth not ſhew that the Lands were of the
value of 500l. <hi>per annum</hi> over and above all Repriſes, as they ought to
be by the Articles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5. He ſheweth that they were his Freehold, but
doth not ſhew that the lands were his lands of Inheritance of which a
Jointure might be made. The opinion of the whole Court was, that
the Exceptions were good, and that the Plea in bar was no good plea.
<hi>Dodderidge,</hi> If the word had been <hi>(Such as his Councel ſhall deviſe)</hi>
then the Notice ought to have been given to the party himſelf, and he
is to inform his Councel of it, 6 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 8. But here two Councellors were
named in certain, and therefore the Notice ought to be given to them,
for he hath appointed Councellors. The whole Plea in bar is naught;
For if he hath an eſtate in tail, then there ought to be a Fine in making
of the Jointure; and if there be a Remainder upon it, then there ought
to be a Recovery: So becauſe that <hi>Lane</hi> hath not informed the party
what eſtate he had in the lands, they could not make the Aſſurance.
<hi>Ley</hi> Chief Juſtice. Where a man is bound to make ſuch Aſſurance of
lands as <hi>J. S.</hi> ſhall adviſe, here he need not ſhew his Evidences, but he
ought to ſhew to the party what the land is, and where it lieth, and the
Obligee is to ſeek out the eſtate at his peril: And then <hi>J. S.</hi> may adviſe
the Aſſurance conditionally, <hi>viz.</hi> That if he hath Fee, then to have ſuch
an aſſurance; and if an Eſtate in tail, then ſuch an aſſurance; and if
there be a Remainder over, then to deviſe a Recovery. <hi>Curia,</hi> All the
Errors are material.</p>
            <p>The Bail for <hi>Lane,</hi> before any Judgment given againſt him, brought
<hi>Lane</hi> into Court, and prayed that they might be diſcharged, and <hi>Lane</hi>
taken into cuſtody<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

not bear action, yet the later words make them actionable. <hi>I will charge
thee with ſuſpition, or flat Felony,</hi> an Action doth not lie, <hi>Hecks</hi> Caſe
proves it. Another Councellor argued that the Action would not lie:
The firſt words are not actionable; For ſo many things as there are in
the world, ſo many peeces there may be, and here it might be a peece of
a thing which could not be Felony. Betwixt <hi>Roberts</hi> and <hi>Hill, 3 Jacobi</hi>
in the Kings Bench it was adjudged, <hi>Roberts hath ſtollen my wood,</hi> the
words were not actionable; for it might be wood ſtanding, and then to
cut and take it away it is not Felony, but Treſpaſs. <hi>Ley</hi> Chief Juſtice,
<hi>I charge thee with flat Felony,</hi> If the words be ſpoken privately to a man
no Action lieth for them; but if they be ſpoken before an Officer, as a
Conſtable, or in a Court which hath conuſance of ſuch Pleas, then the
Action will lie, for the party by reaſon of ſuch words may come into
trouble: But if a man charge one with flat Felony, and chargeth the
Conſtable with him, then an Action will not lie, becauſe it is in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
courſe of Juſtice. <hi>C. 4. part</hi> 14. If a man maketh a Bargain with
another to pay him twenty Peeces for ſuch a thing, it ſhall be taken by
common intendment twenty 22<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. peeces of gold, which vulgarly are
called Peeces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But to endite a man for 20 Peeces is not certain, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſuch Indictment is not good; and the Action in our Caſe will not
lie, for <hi>(my Peece)</hi> is an incertain word. <hi>Dodderidge. Thou haſt ſtollen
my Peece,</hi> What is that? For we call 22<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. in gold a Peece. You ought
to tell it in certain: And here the <hi>innuendo</hi> will not make the ſcandal,
but the words of ſcandal ought to proceed out of the parties own mouth;
and an <hi>Innuendo</hi> cannot make that certain, which was uncertain in the
words of the ſpeaker: And therefore the Action here will not lie.
<hi>Haughton</hi> Juſtice, If the whole matter had been ſet forth in the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:40982:170"/>
as to have ſhewed that the parties before this ſpeech had had
ſpeeches of a Gun, then the Action in this caſe would have been main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable;
but here, the word (Peece) is incertain, and the Action will not
lie. <hi>Chamberlain</hi> Juſtice, If the ſpeeches had been concerning a Gun
loſt, then upon theſe words ſpoken the Action would have lien, but not
as they are here ſpoken; For the two words there, ought to have been
matter ſubſequent, as upon the charging with Felony, to have delivered
him to an Officer. And ſo by the whole Court it was adjudged, <hi>Quod

was to cover a Church in <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> and he declared he had co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered

and makes the Declaration to be inſufficient, becauſe it is not according

            <p>
               <hi>SHeene</hi> brought a Writ of Error upon a Judgment given in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Pleas. The Caſe was, <hi>Bullen</hi> being a Commoner, intituling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
by thoſe whoſe Eſtate he had in the Land, brought an Action upon
the Caſe againſt <hi>Sheene,</hi> becauſe he had digged clay in the land where
the Plaintiffe had Common, and had carried away the ſame over the
Common, <hi>per quod</hi> he loſt his Common, and by that could not
uſe his Common in as ample manner as he did before. <hi>Sheene</hi> entitled
himſelf to be a Commoner, and have common in the ſaid land alſo, and
ſo juſtified the Entrie, and ſet forth a preſcription, That every Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
had uſed to dig clay there, and the firſt iſſue was found for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant
<hi>Sheene, viz.</hi> that he was a Commoner; but the other iſſue was
found for the Plaintiffe <hi>Bullen, viz.</hi> that there was no ſuch preſcription,
That a Commoner might dig clay: And the Jury did aſſeſſe damages
to the Plaintiffe generally; and the ſame was moved to be Error, becauſe
that the Plaintiffe had not damage by carrying away of the clay, becauſe
the ſame did not belong to him, for that he was but a Commoner; and
ſo the Judgment given in the Court of Common Pleas was Erroneous.
<hi>Ley</hi> Chief Juſtice, By the digging of a pit the Commoner is prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
by the laying of the clay upon the Common the Commoner is preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced,
and ſo the damages are given for the digging and carrying away
of the clay, <hi>per quod Commoniam ſuam amiſit,</hi> and the damages are not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
for the clay. <hi>Chamberlain</hi> Juſtice, If he had ſuffered the clay to lie
by the pit, it had been damage to the Commoner. If the Owner of the
ſoil plough up or maketh conyburies in the Land, an Action upon the
caſe lyeth againſt him by the Commoner, for thereby the Common is
much the worſe, and the Commoner prejudicedS If the pit be deep, it
is dangerous to the Commoner, and ſo a damage unto him, for it is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
leſt his cattel ſhould fall into it, and it will not ſuddenly be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
up again, and ſo no graſs there for a long time, and the longer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that which ſhould fill up the pit is carried away. <hi>Haughton</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
The proceedings are Erroneous, both Plaintiffe and Defendant
are Commoners, The wrong is in two points. Firſt, That the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
had with his cattell fed the <hi>Common:</hi> Secondly, That the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
had digged clay there, and carried the ſame away; The Defendant
makes Title to both: Firſt he preſcribes to have Common there;
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:40982:172"/>
Secondly, That the Commoners by preſcription have uſed to have and
dig clay there. The firſt point is found for the Defendant, and the laſt
iſſue is found againſt the Defendant, and damages are given generally:
All the queſtion is upon the Declaration <hi>Coepit &amp; aſportavit</hi> the clay,
which implies a propertie and intereſt in the clay to be to the Plaintiffe.
It is not ſaid that the clay was carried over the land; I conceive that
the property of the clay is in iſſue, and the Commoner hath nothing to
do with that: So damages being given to him for that which doth not
belong unto him, I hold the Judgment to be Erroneous, and that it
ought to be reverſed. <hi>Dodderidge,</hi> The Declaration is well enough, and
of neceſſity it cannot be otherwiſe: Here the Plaintiffe challengeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Common; In an Action upon the Caſe there ought to be inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
and damage, which is the conſequent upon injurie; For an Action
upon the Caſe will not lie for an injurie without damage. Here <hi>Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi>
doth not complain for any thing but the loſs of his Common, which
is the firſt wrong: The ſecond wrong is the digging of the pit, in the
which his cattel may fall and periſh: The third wrong is, for carrying
away of ſix loads of clay over the Common, which is a great detriment
to the Common, to carrie it either by Carts or otherwiſe: and for theſe
three wrongs he concludes his damages, <hi>ratione cujus</hi> he could not have
his Common in as ample manner as before he was uſed to have it, and
he doth not conclude any damage for the clay: Every one of theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
doth increaſe the damages, and ſo it would have been if he had
left the clay to lie upon the land by the pit, for thereby ſo much Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
would have been loſt. Here he makes himſelf title only to the
Common, and theſe Acts do increaſe the damages only. 2. <hi>E.</hi> 4. &amp; 7 <hi>E.</hi> 4.
Where one was unlawfully and falſly impriſoned, and being impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned,
compelled to levie a Fine or make a Feoffment, or other Deed.
In an Action of falſe Impriſonment the Jurie gave damages, by reaſon of
his reſtraint of his Liberty, and increaſed them by reaſon of the levying
of the Fine, or making the Feoffment or other Deed, which he then
made. The Jurie found that he is not to have any clay, and <hi>coepit &amp;
aſportavit</hi> doth not alter the Caſe; for that is a ſpecial Action of treſpaſs.
And by three of the Juſtices againſt <hi>Haughton,</hi> the Judgment given in

Land, made a Leaſe for years; and it was holden by the Court then, That

and that the wife ſhould have the land again, notwithſtanding this
forfeiture by the husband, by making a Leaſe for years, without Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence:
And the Court ſeemed to allow of the ſaid Caſe to be Law.
And afterwards, this very Term the like Caſe came in queſtion in this
Court, betwixt <hi>Severn</hi> and <hi>Smith,</hi> where in an <hi>Ejectione firme,</hi> a ſpecial
Verdict found, That a Copyholder ſeiſed in the right of his wife, made a
Leaſe for years; and it was a queſtion whether it were a forfeiture of the
inheritance of the wife. <hi>Hitcham</hi> Serjeant ſaid it was no forfeiture: <hi>Dodde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridg</hi>
Juſtice took this difference, Where a <hi>Feme Sole</hi> is a Copyholder, and
ſhe takes a husband, who makes a leaſe for years without licence, the ſame
is a forfeiture, becauſe it is her folly to take ſuch a husband as will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit

and the husband maketh a Leaſe without Licence, in ſuch caſe it is no

            </p>
            <p>All before the clauſe, <hi>quorum quidem, &amp;c.</hi> is but collection; and
he ought to have concluded with a cauſe of grievance, <hi>viz. quorum

is ſaid that this word <hi>(praetextu)</hi> is a concluſion that the particular
wrong doth contain, and doth affirm that which went before; but in
this caſe the word <hi>(praetextu)</hi> is wanting, and a Seiſin firſt ought to be
laid, and then <hi>praetextu quorum</hi> is good. <hi>Vi. Bullen</hi> and <hi>Sheenes</hi> caſe
before, where the Plaintiffe firſt made him title to the Common, <hi>viz.</hi>
that he was ſuch a time ſeiſed in Fee, <hi>&amp; adhuc ſeiſitus exiſtens,</hi> that the
Defendant did dig clay: <hi>Vi. Brown</hi> and <hi>Greens</hi> Caſe in the Common
Pleas. 40 <hi>Eliz.</hi> Where a man pleaded a Feoffment and Livery, <hi>Virtute
cujus</hi> he was ſeiſed in fee, and did not ſhew that he entred, and yet the
ſame was good, becauſe the <hi>Virtute cujus</hi> was a good concluſion. <hi>Ley</hi>
Chief Juſtice, <hi>(diu)</hi> doth not denote any time certain; If in a Caſe it
had been <hi>poſtea,</hi> or <hi>ſic inde ſeiſitus,</hi> the Defendant did the wrong, then
the Declaration had been good; but here is nothing to which <hi>diu,</hi> may
have reference: If he had ſaid, that he being <hi>(diu ſeiſitus)</hi> that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant
had ſuch a day done the wrong, it had been good.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Here ought to have been either <hi>quorum quidem premiſſorum
ratione,</hi> or <hi>praetextu,</hi> he loſt his Common: here the <hi>Latine</hi> is good, <hi>viz.
quorum quidem premiſſorum Commoniam perdidit,</hi> but it is not good in
Law. <hi>Dodderidge</hi> Juſtice, You ought to have coupled the damage and
the wrong; and in this caſe there wants the coupling, for want of the
word <hi>(praetextu)</hi> for the word <hi>(praetextu)</hi> is the application of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
matter: The matter of wrong is the making of the conyburies,
by reaſon of which he loſt his Common: and the <hi>quorum quidem</hi> here
hath not any ſenſe: The Declaration wants matter of form alſo; <hi>diu
fuit ſeiſitus &amp; adhuc ſeiſitus exiſtens.</hi> Might you not have purchaſed
this Common after the wrong done by the making of the conyburies?
for it doth not appear otherwiſe by the Declaration; for as well as
<hi>(diu)</hi> may comprehend forty years, ſo it may but one moneth. If it
had been <hi>diu ſeiſitus &amp; ſic ſeiſitus)</hi> that he made the conyburies, then
the Declaration had been well; but as this caſe is, it is not good.
<hi>Haughton</hi> Juſtice, Your Action ought to have contained your matter
of time, as well as your matter of wrong. <hi>(Diu)</hi> includes no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of time; and <hi>quorum quidem premiſſorum, &amp;c.</hi> is a ſpeech
without ſenſe. If a man maketh title to have Common <hi>pro omnibus
averiis,</hi> and the word <hi>(ſuis)</hi> is omitted, it is not good.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ley</hi> Chief Juſtice, here the wrong and damage are not knit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by theſe words; and it might be that in this caſe he had loſt his
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:40982:174"/>
Common by ſome other means: For he doth alleadge that he loſt his
Common; but how he loſt it, that doth not appear to us. If he had
ſaid, <hi>Virtute cujus,</hi> or <hi>per quod,</hi> or <hi>ratione cujus</hi> he had loſt his Common,
then the Declaration had been certain, and had been well enough: But
here it being incertain, both in the <hi>ſeiſitus,</hi> and alſo in the alleadging
the damage, The Judgment given in the Court of Common-Pleas for
theſe Errors was reverſed.</p>

That <hi>M. Kellaway</hi> ſeiſed of the Mannor of <hi>Lillington</hi> in Fee, holden in
Soccage, did deviſe the ſame by his Will in writing in theſe words, <hi>viz.
For the good will I bear unto the name of the</hi> Kellawayes, <hi>I give all my
Lands to</hi> John Kellaway <hi>in tail, the Remainder to my right Heirs, ſo long
as they keep the true intent and meaning of this my Will. To have to the ſaid</hi>
John Kellaway <hi>and the heirs of his body, untill</hi> John Kellaway <hi>or any of
his iſſues go about to alter and change the intent and meaning of this my Will.
Then, and in ſuch caſe it ſhall be lawfull to and for</hi> H. Kellaway <hi>to enter
and have the Land in tail with the like limitation.</hi> And ſo the Lands was
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:40982:175"/>
put in Remainder to five ſeveral perſons, the Remainder to the right
heirs of the Deviſor. <hi>M. Kellaway</hi> dyed without iſſue, <hi>John Kellaway</hi>
is heir, and entred and demiſed the ſame to <hi>R. K.</hi> for 500 years, and
afterwards granted all his eſtate to <hi>Hard.</hi> Afterwards <hi>John Kellaway</hi>
did agree by Deed indented with <hi>W. K.</hi> to levy a Fine of the Reverſion
to <hi>W.</hi> and his heirs. <hi>H. Kellaway</hi> entred according to the words of the
<hi>Proviſo</hi> in the Will, and made the Leaſe to <hi>Foy,</hi> who brought an <hi>Eje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctione
Firme</hi> againſt <hi>Hard.</hi> And whether <hi>H. Kellaway</hi> might lawfully
enter or no was the Queſtion. It was objected, That in the Caſe there
is not any Forfeiture, becauſe the Fine was without proclamations, and
ſo it was a Diſcontinuance only. The firſt Queſtion is, If the Remainder
doth continue: The ſecond is, If it be a Perpetuity, or a Limitation.
<hi>John Kellaway</hi> is Tenant in tail by Deviſe, untill ſuch time as <hi>John Kel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laway</hi>
or any of his iſſues agree or go about to alter or change the eſtate
tail mentioned in the Will; with <hi>Proviſo</hi> to make Leaſes for 21 years,
3 lives, or to make Jointures: Then his Will is, That it ſhall be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for <hi>H. K.</hi> to enter and to have the Land with the ſame limitations.
If it be a Perpetuity, then it is for the Plaintiffe; but if it be but a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation,
then it is for the Defendant. The Fine was levied without
proclamations, and <hi>H. K.</hi> entreth for the Forfeiture.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Damport,</hi> It is no Perpetuity, but a Limitation, which is not reſtrained
by the Law as Perpetuities are, Untill ſuch time as <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall diſcontinue
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Jury find an Agreement by Indenture: The act which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged
to be the breach, is, <hi>Concluſivit &amp; agreavit,</hi> not to levy a Fine
with proclamations, but to levy a Fine without proclamations, which is
but a Diſcontinuance. <hi>Yelverton,</hi> If the Fine had been with proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
then without doubt he in the Remainder during the life of him
who levied it had been barred. The Deviſe was, To have to them and

obſerve, perform, fulfill and keep the true meaning of this my Will
touching the entailed Lands in form following, and no otherwiſe. And
therfore I <hi>M. Kellaway</hi> do deviſe unto <hi>John Kellaway</hi> &amp; the iſſue of his

            <p>IN this Caſe <hi>George Crook</hi> ſaid, That Land could not belong to Land:

<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Swan</hi> and the <hi>Red-Lyon;</hi> and <hi>A.</hi> hath the <hi>Swan</hi> in his own

the <hi>Red-Lyon)</hi> with the <hi>Swan</hi>-houſe, and then leaſeth the <hi>Red-lyon</hi> houſe,
and then by his Will deviſeth his houſes called the <hi>Swan:</hi> The rooms
of the <hi>Lyon</hi> which <hi>A.</hi> occupied with the <hi>Swan</hi> ſhall paſs by the Deviſe,
although of right thoſe rooms do belong to the <hi>Lyon</hi>-houſe. <hi>Paſc. 36 Eliz.
Ewer</hi> and <hi>Heydon's</hi> Caſe. A man hath a houſe and divers lands in <hi>W.</hi>
and alſo a houſe and lands in <hi>D.</hi> And by his Will he deviſeth his houſe
and all his lands in <hi>W.</hi> &amp; <hi>D.</hi> there the houſe which is in <hi>D.</hi> doth not paſs,
for his intent and meaning plainly appears that his houſe in <hi>D.</hi> doth not
paſs: But if he had deviſed all his lands in <hi>W.</hi> and had not ſpoken of
the houſe, the houſe had paſſed. A Caſe was in the Common-Pleas
betwixt <hi>Hyam</hi> and <hi>Baker:</hi> The Deviſor had two Farms, and occupied
parcel of one of the Farms with the other Farm, and deviſed the Farm
which he had in his poſſeſſion; The part of the other Farm which he
occupied with it, did paſs with the Farm deviſed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dodderidge</hi> Juſtice, The Deviſe is in the Caſe at Bar: All his Farm
called <hi>Locks</hi> to his eldeſt Son, and all his Farm called <hi>Brocks</hi> to his
younger Son; And the Land in queſtion was purchaſed long after that
the Deviſor purchaſed <hi>Brocks;</hi> but that Land newly purchaſed was
not expreſly named in the Will, and therefore it ſhall diſcend to the
heir, <hi>viz.</hi> the eldeſt Son. Land is not parcel of a houſe, and in ſtrictneſs
of Law cannot appertain to a houſe: Yet Land is appertaining to the
Office of the <hi>Fleet</hi> and the <hi>Rolls;</hi> but that is to the Office, which is in
another nature then the Land is. For the Land newly purchaſed, (the
Jury did not find the ſame to be uſually occupied with <hi>Brocks)</hi> it ſhall
not paſs with <hi>Brocks,</hi> although it be occupied together with <hi>Brocks.</hi>
I do occupie ſeveral Farms together, and then I deviſe one of the Farms
called <hi>D.</hi> and all the lands to the ſame belonging; the other Farms
ſhall not paſs with it, although they be occupied all together. <hi>Haughton</hi>
Juſtice, What time will make lands to belong unto a houſe? All the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:40982:176"/>
of the lands uſed with the houſe for a ſmall time will ſerve the turn.
<hi>Ley</hi> Chief Juſtice, There are two manner of belongings; One belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in courſe of Right, and another belonging in caſe of Occupation.
To the firſt belonging there ought to be Preſcription, <hi>viz.</hi> time out of
mind: But in our Caſe, Belonging doth borrow ſome ſenſe from
occupying for a year, or a time; And then another year to occupie it
will not make it belonging in the later ſenſe. In ſtrictneſs of Law, Land
cannot be ſaid to belong to a houſe, or land; but in vulgar reputation it
may be ſaid belonging: And in ſuch caſe, in caſe of grant, the Land will
not paſs as appertaining to Land, <hi>C. 4. part. Terringham's</hi> Caſe. But in
our Caſe, it is in caſe of a Will. Uſually occupied, is not to be meant
time out of mind. Here other lands were belonging to <hi>Brocks;</hi> and ſo
the words of the Will are ſatisfied. But it might have been a Queſtion,
if there had been no other lands belonging to it. <hi>Dodderidge</hi> Juſtice, If
the Deviſor had turned all the profits thereof to <hi>Brocks,</hi> then it had
paſſed by the Will. <hi>Ley</hi> Chief Juſtice, This occupying of it promiſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
doth make it belong to neither.</p>
            <p>At another day, <hi>Ley</hi> Chief Juſtice ſaid, Here is nothing which makes
it appear to us that this Land doth belong to <hi>Brocks:</hi> For the Jury find
not that it was occupied either with <hi>Brocks</hi> or <hi>Locks;</hi> and ſo this Land
belongs to neither of them. <hi>Dodderidge,</hi> There is not any Queſtion in
the Caſe: It is not found that it doth belong; And then we muſt not
judge it belonging. The ground of this queſtion ariſeth out of the
matter of fact; and it ought to be found at the leaſt, that it is apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
in Reputation. <hi>Haughton,</hi> The Jury find that <hi>Knight</hi> was ſeiſed
of <hi>Brocks</hi> and of lands belonging to it, And that he was ſeiſed of <hi>Locks</hi>
and of lands belonging to that, And laſtly they find that he was ſeiſed
of this Land in queſtion, but they do not find that it was any wayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to <hi>Brocks</hi> or <hi>Locks.</hi> It was adjudged for the Plaintiff, and that
the Land did not paſs by the Deviſe, but that it did diſcend to the heir.</p>

            <p>IN an <hi>Ejection Firme</hi> the Verdict was found for the Defendant. Three
of the Jurors had Sweet-meats in their pockets; and thoſe three were
for the Plaintiffe, untill they were ſearched and the Sweet-meats found
with them, and then they did agree with the other nine, and gave their
Verdict for the Defendant. <hi>Haughton</hi> Juſtice, It doth not appear that
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:40982:177"/>
theſe Sweet-meats were provided for them by the Plaintiffe or Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant;
and it doth not appear that the ſaid three Jurors did eat of the
Sweet-meats before the Verdict given: And ſo I conceive there is not
any cauſe to make void the Verdict given; but the ſaid three Jurors are
fineable. <hi>Dodderidge</hi> Juſtice, Whether they eat or not, they are fineable
for the having of the Sweet-meats with them, for it is a very great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanour.
And now we cannot tell which of the Jurors the three were;
and becauſe it was not moved before the Jurors departed from the Bar,
it is now too late to examine the Jurors, for we do not know for which
three to ſend for. The nine drew the three which had the Sweet-meats
to their opinions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore there is no cauſe to ſtay Judgment:
But if the three Jurors had drawn the nine other to them, then there
had been ſufficient cauſe to have ſtayed the Judgment; but as this caſe is

legal courſe, <hi>viz.</hi> a lawful Retorn; for it was retorned by the new
Sheriffe, and alſo by him who did not execute the Commiſſion. <hi>Heath</hi>
ſaid cleerly, There was no Record for the King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and vouched 21 <hi>H. 7.
20,</hi> 21. Note the whole Caſe there. 1. Where it is ſaid, <hi>In caſu ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ori
ipſe Juſticiarius qui primo illud breve de Supplicavit recepit, tota exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutione
ejuſdem Brevis tantummodo tenetur, &amp; reliqui ſociorum ſuorum
tangent. dictum Breve exonerentur, &amp; Juſticiarius hanc recipiens nomine
ſuo proprio illud retornabit.</hi> And in our Caſe it was directed to the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffe
and Iuſtices; and being delivered to the Iuſtices, the Sheriffe had
not to do to make Certificate of it, and in this caſe he is but as a private
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:40982:178"/>
man. This ſuit is a <hi>Scire facias</hi> to have Execution upon the ſaid Recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance.
A <hi>Dedimus poteſtatem</hi> is directed to two, and one of them doth
execute it; the other cannot certifie it, for the Execution of it ought to
be upon his own knowledge. A Record taken by one cannot be certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by another; for if it be, it is not any Record upon which a <hi>Scire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facias</hi>
can be awarded. In our Caſe, the Juſtices made the Record, and
the Sheriffe did certifie it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ley</hi> Chief Juſtice, When the Recognizance is put to writing, or Notes
of Remembrance taken of the Recognizance before the Commiſſioners,
it is immediately a Record. One takes Notes of a Recognizance, and
dyeth. He to whoſe hands the Notes come may certifie the ſame, for
it is a perfect Record by the taking of the Notes of Remembrance: But
that is to be underſtood when no Writ is directed to Commiſſioners, but
when a Juſtice takes is. In our Caſe the Sheriffe may retorn the Writ
<hi>ex officio,</hi> and alſo retorn, That <hi>executio iſtius brevis patet in quadam
ſchedula annexa.</hi> And it doth not appear but that the now Sheriffe was
at the Execution of this Commiſſion: But admit that he was not, yet
now the Writ being retorned into the Chancery, your pleading and
taking iſſue upon another matter hath made it a good Record: And
therefore I hold that the Judgment ought to be given for the King ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Verdict. <hi>Haughton</hi> Juſtice, Judgment cannot be for
King: If the Record doth not come duly into the Chancery according
to courſe of Law, it is not any Record upon which there can be any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.
If a Judge take a Fine and dyeth before it be certified, a <hi>Certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orari</hi>
ought to be directed to the Executors of the Judge, <hi>v. 2 H.</hi> 7. 10.
but the <hi>Certiorari</hi> ought not to be to a ſtranger. If two Iuſtices of
Peace have Commiſſion to take a Recognizance, and one of them taketh
it and dyeth, the <hi>Certiorari</hi> muſt be to his Executors, and not to the
other Iuſtice. In this Caſe the Record came into the Chancery by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
courſe: The Commiſſion was ſeveral, <hi>Cuilibet eorum;</hi> and thoſe
who took upon them the Execution thereof are now made Officers by
the expreſs words of the Writ; and it is not ſo here retorned, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Iudgment ought to be againſt the King. A <hi>Dedimus poteſtatem</hi> is
directed to four to take a Fine of Lands in ſeveral Counties: Two of
them take it in one County, and they certifie it and the two other take it
in another County, and they certifie it: None of the Certificates
are good.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dodderidge</hi> Iuſtice, Iudgment ought to be againſt the King. There
are two Queſtions in the Caſe. 1. Whether the Sheriffe, as this Caſe
is, may onely make the Retorn. 2. Admitting that he cannot, but the
ſame being retorned, and the Chancery accepting of it, and ſending it
to this Court, whether we can damn the Record. 1. This is a ſpecial
Recognizance upon the grievance of the party; and by the Kings Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
they are made eſpecial Iudges in this caſe: And when the party
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:40982:178"/>
who ſues delivers the ſame to the two Juſtices, the Sheriff cannot enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle
therewith; for then the Juſtices ought to retorn the Recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance
by vertue of that Commiſſion. 21 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 20, 21. there the Caſe is
direct in the point, That they to whom the Writ is firſt delivered, they
only are to execute it, and retorn it; for they only have power by vertue
of the ſpecial Commiſſion. The Writ was againſt three, and two of
them are not to be found, The Sheriff cannot retorn <hi>Non ſunt inventi,</hi>
for the two by force of this Commiſſion: and he is not to make his
Retorn as a Miniſter or Officer to the other, becauſe the Writ is Judicial.
If a Challenge be to the Sheriff and Coroners, and proceſs is directed to
<hi>Eſliors;</hi> they are to execute the proceſs as particular Officers, by vertue
of the Writ, and they are to retorn the ſame, and not the Sheriff, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
their authority is by vertue of a ſpecial Writ. To the 2. point
it hath been ſaid, That the Record is in the Chancery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the partie
hath pleaded to it to iſſue, and it is now ſent into this Court, and now
fault is found with it but not before.</p>
            <p>Though all this be ſo, yet we cannot accept of it here, if it have
not due proceedings: If proceſs be directed to the Coronors for Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
to the Sheriff, and then a new Sheriff is made, againſt whom there
is no cauſe of challenge, yet the Coronors muſt execute and finiſh the
proceſs, and not the new Sheriff; for the Law will not endure that Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fficers
do make a mingling of their Offices, <hi>Vi. 13 E.</hi> 4 &amp; 10 <hi>E.</hi> 3.
By <hi>Hill</hi> and <hi>Herle.</hi> For Trials out of the Chancery: the Chancery and
Kings Bench are but as one Court, and if the Record come not in due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as it ſhould, the Court was never well ſeiſed of the Record. <hi>Ley</hi>
Chief Juſtice, The coming of the Writ to the hands of one or two of
the Commiſſioners, ſhall not ſtay the Commiſſion, but the receipt of
the one of them, is the receit of them all having notice of it; and the
others may joyn with him to whom the Commiſſion is delivered: So it
is in all caſes, every one of the Commiſſioners are intereſſed therein upon
notice, and not he only to whom the Commiſſion is delivered. If one
Juſtice of peace taketh a Recognizance, and dieth before it be certified,
the <hi>Certiorari</hi> ſhall be directed to the other Juſtice to certifie it, if it
come to his hands, and he may retorn the Recognizance, and it ſhall
not be directed to the Executors of the Iuſtice, who have not the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognizance;
for the <hi>Certiorari</hi> is but the hand for the Court to receive
it, for otherwiſe the King might loſe the benefit of the Recognizance:
And in our Caſe the Sheriff by a ſpecial Commiſſion hath Authority to
take the Recognizance, and to retorn it upon Record. One may do
part of the Office, as to make and take the Recognizance, and the other
may retorn it; but one cannot execute a thing in part, and another in
another part; the taking of the Recognizance by the two Juſtices, doth
exclude the Sheriff from medling with the taking or making of it, but
it doth not hinder him but that he may retorn it well enough; and the
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:40982:179"/>
Writ or Commiſſion is general, <hi>Vicecomiti,</hi> which may extend as
well to the new Sheriff as to the old Sheriff. The Caſe was adjourned:
for by two Iudges, the <hi>Supplicavit</hi> and <hi>Recognizance</hi> were not well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torned
by the new Sheriff; but <hi>Ley</hi> Chief Juſtice was againſt them.

            <p>THe Caſe was, <hi>Harvey,</hi> in conſideration that <hi>Brown</hi> might go at
large, who was arreſted at the ſuit of <hi>Randal,</hi> gave his word that
<hi>Brown</hi> ſhould pay the money at ſuch a day certain; and for non-pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the money, <hi>Randal</hi> brought his Action againſt <hi>Harvey,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at iſſue upon the promiſe, it was found for the Plaintiff.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yelverton</hi> moved in arreſt of Iudgment, that the arreſt of <hi>Brown</hi>
was not warrantable by Law; and that being the conſideration, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
was void: and he ſaid, A man cannot make another his Attorney
to arreſt another man without Deed, neither can the Sheriff give War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
to his Baylie to arreſt another without a Deed ſealed. And in the
principal caſe, <hi>Randal</hi> gave one a VVarrant to <hi>T.</hi> being an Attorney,
to demand, receive, and recover money from <hi>Brown;</hi> but it did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
by the Declaration, that the VVarrant was by Deed in writing.
<hi>George Crook,</hi> ſaid that it was no Exception; For, be the Arreſt lawfull
or unlawfull, yet he ſaid the conſideration was good.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Randal</hi> gave to his Attornie Authority to receive, demand, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover,
thereby he gave him Authority to arreſt <hi>Brown,</hi> becauſe the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
is incident to the Recoverie. 2 <hi>R. 2. Grants,</hi> One grants to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
all the Fiſh in his Pond, he may fiſh with Nets: For when he
giveth the principal, the incidents do follow. VVhen <hi>Brown</hi> had yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
himſelf to be lawfully arreſted; and then <hi>Harvey,</hi> in conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that <hi>Brown</hi> might go at liberty, made the promiſe, the ſame was good:
The Declaration was, That <hi>Randal</hi> gave Authority to <hi>T.</hi> being an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney,
to receive, deliver, and recover the Debt, by force of which Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Attorney <hi>T.</hi> did arreſt <hi>Brown;</hi> and ſo in the Declaration it is
ſhewed that the Warrant was a Letter of Attorney, <hi>Yelverton, 34 H.</hi> 6.
In Debt upon a Recoverie in the 5 <hi>Ports:</hi> If a man will declare and
ſet forth a thing in particular, if he faileth in any thing, it overthroweth
his Action; But if a man alledge generally a Recoverie in the 5 <hi>Ports,</hi>
then the ſame is good enough. I agree the Caſe of 9 <hi>E.</hi> 4. Where a
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:40982:179"/>
man gives leave to another to lay Pipes of Lead through his Lands, that
he may dig the ground to lay them there, becauſe it is incident to it.
And I agree the Caſe of 2 <hi>R.</hi> 2. for there the one thing cannot be
done without the other, <hi>viz.</hi> the Fiſh cannot be taken without Nets;
but in this Caſe, the partie might have come by his money by <hi>Outlawrie,</hi>
and ſo there needed no arreſting of the partie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ley</hi> Chief Juſtice, If he had declared <hi>debito modo arreſtatus,</hi> it had been
generally good, and it muſt be intended that the Arreſt was by vertue of
a Letter of Attorney: For he alledges that he gave him Authority to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover;
and then he ſhall have and uſe the means to recover, as to arreſt
the partie, or to <hi>outlaw</hi> him. <hi>Haughton</hi> Juſtice, Things incident and
acceſſary may be comprehended in the principal, as to dig for to mend
the Pipe 9 <hi>E.</hi> 4. Becauſe he grants him leave to lay them in the ground;
and ſo he may dig, and juſtifie the ſame for the amending of the pipes.
If <hi>A.</hi> Licence <hi>B.</hi> to hunt in his Park, and to kill a Deer, yet <hi>B.</hi> cannot
carry away the Deer, for that is not incident to the thing granted. In
this caſe the Declaration is not good, for he ought to ſet forth that the
VVarrant was by Deed in writing; and yet one may plead a Judgment
generally, <hi>quod debito modo</hi> he recovered, and the ſame is good; but
here in this caſe he ought to ſet forth and ſhew the VVarrant and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
by which he was arreſted; but not ſo in the caſe of pleading
of a Judgment, becauſe there it doth refer to matter of Record. <hi>Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deridge</hi>
Juſtice, The promiſe was to free him from the arreſt, and if the
arreſt was unlawfull, then there was no conſideration, and ſo by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent
the promiſe was void: It ought to be ſhewed that <hi>Brown</hi> was
lawfully arreſt; and if the arreſt had been only matter of inducement,
and no cauſe of the Action, then it had been ſufficient to have ſaid <hi>debito
modo arreſtatus,</hi> but in this caſe the arreſt it ſelf is material; and the
Plaintiff hath ſhewed that the arreſt was <hi>(per debitum legis Curſum)</hi> by
vertue of a VVarrant of Attorney, and it doth not appear but that it
was a Letter of Attorney to deliver Seiſin: and ſo becauſe the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff
hath not ſhewed the arreſt to be lawfull, there was no good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
whereupon to ground the promiſe, and ſo no cauſe of
Action.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yelverton</hi> took another Exception, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Plaintiff doth not
ſhew that the arreſt was <hi>per breve Regis,</hi> or how it was. <hi>Chamberlain</hi>
Juſtice, If the partie had brought an Action of falſe Impriſonment, this
Plea had not been good, and in this caſe there appeareth to be no good
conſideration, for it doth not appear that it was a lawfull arreſt, for no
time is ſhewed, nor no place, nor how it was done. <hi>Ley,</hi> The Jury have
found it to be <hi>debito modo,</hi> and in this caſe the arreſt is not in queſtion
by matter of Plea, but by Declaration, and the finding of the Jury
hath made the ſame to be good. <hi>Dodderidge</hi> Juſtice, If <hi>A.</hi> be indebt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to <hi>B. B</hi> may have either an Action upon the Caſe, or an Action of
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:40982:180"/>
Debt for the money; but in an Action of Debt, unleſs it be in <hi>London</hi>
by the Cuſtome, <hi>Conceſſit ſolvere</hi> is no good Plea: But in an Action up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Caſe, the Plaintiff may declare, That whereas <hi>A.</hi> was indebted
to him in a certain ſum of money, that <hi>Conceſſit ſolvere,</hi> and there he
needeth not to ſhew how he became indebted unto him, as he ought to
do in an Action of Debt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chamberlain</hi> Juſtice, If a man be arreſted upon a void arreſt, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
in conſideration of ſetting him at liberty doth promiſe to pay the
Debt, there it is a thing Collateral, and an Action will lie: But if the
arreſt cometh in queſtion, then in that Caſe the Action will not lie, but
he may avoid it by ſpecial pleading; for the arreſt being unlawfull, there
is no conſideration whereupon to ground the promiſe. <hi>Yelverton,</hi> If the
Plaintiff had ſaid in the Declaration, That in conſideration that he
would forbear his Debt, that he would pay, &amp;c. there for not pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the Action would have been maintainable: but in this caſe, the
conſideration is the ſetting him at Liberty, and ſo it is Collateral. At
another day, <hi>Ley</hi> Chief Juſtice, If I arreſt a man generally, and the
party promiſe for the diſcharge of the arreſt, to give <hi>20l.</hi> it is no good
conſideration, if I do not ſhew that he had cauſe to arreſt him; For if
the arreſt be upon an ill ground, the conſideration is not good. <hi>Haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
Juſtice, To make it a lawfull arreſt, the partie ought to ſhew the
Proceſs, the Letter of Attorney, and the proceedings; and an agreement
afterwards made, will not make the arreſt good. <hi>Legitimo &amp; debito mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
arreſtatus</hi> is too general; for he ought to ſhew how he became indebt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to him: For if I be bounden to make unto <hi>I. S.</hi> a lawfull aſſurance
or conveyance of ſuch Lands, it is too general for me to ſay that I have
made him a lawfull aſſurance; but I ought to ſhew what manner of
aſſurance it is, that the Court may judge whether it be a lawfull and
good aſſurance or not. In <hi>Mich.</hi> Term followinging 21 <hi>Jacobi,</hi> It was

            <p>A Writ of Error was brought to Reverſe a Judgment given in the

The Error which was aſſigned was, becauſe that it appeareth that the

<hi>Br. Deviſe</hi> 39. A deviſe to one to ſell, to give, or do with at his
will and pleaſure, is a Fee-ſimple. And in our Caſe if <hi>N.</hi> ſhall not
take a fourth part, the word (heirs) ſhould be of no effect. <hi>C. 1. part</hi>
in <hi>Shellies</hi> Caſe, All the words in a Deed ſhall take effect, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting
any of them; and if it be ſo in a Deed, <hi>à fortiori</hi> in a Will,
which is moſt commonly made by a ſick man who hath not Councell
with him to inform or direct him. In this Caſe the three ſiſters who
were living at the time of the Deviſe, took preſently by way of remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
and the word (heirs) was added only to ſhew the intent of the
Deviſor, That if any of the three ſiſters had died before his wife, that
then her heir ſhould take by diſcent, becauſe her mother had taken by
purchaſe. And by reaſon of the word (heirs) the heir of <hi>A.</hi> ſhall take
by purchaſe; and the disjunctive word (or) ſhall be taken for (and) as

of the value of <hi>400l.</hi> to her ſon or her daughter; and ſhe deviſed the
Lands to her ſon and her daughter: And it was reſolved that it was a
good performance of the Condition. And there the word (or) was

deviſe all my goods in <hi>Dale</hi> or <hi>Sale,</hi> it ſhall be a Deviſe of all my goods

(heirs) was not added of neceſſity for the heir of any of the ſiſters to
take by purchaſe; but only to make the heir of <hi>A.</hi> to take part of the
Lands. The Court was of opinion that it was ſtronger for the Plaintiff
to have it (or) in the disjunctive; For they ſaid that if it were (and)
then it would give the three ſiſters the Fee, and not give the heir of <hi>A.</hi>
a fourth part; but being (or) there is more colour that ſhe ſhall
take a fourth part by force of the Deviſe. It was adjourned.</p>

            <p>THe Caſe was, An Enfant Copyholder made a Leaſe for years by
word, not warranted by the Cuſtome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> rendring Rent; The Enfant
at his full age was admitted to the Copyhold, and afterwards accepted
of the Rent: The queſtion was, Whether this Leaſe, and the acception
of the Rent ſhould bind, or conclude the Enfant. <hi>Crawley</hi> Serjeant
argued, That it was a void Leaſe, and that the acception ſhould not bar
him. It is a ground in Law, That an Enfant can do no Act by bare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
by word, or by writing can do any Act which is a wrong either to
himſelf or unto another perſon, or to his prejudice. In this Caſe, if
the Leaſe ſhould be effectual, it were a wrong unto a ſtranger, <hi>viz.</hi> the
Lord, and a prejudice unto himſelf, to make a forfeiture of the Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance.
If an Enfant commandeth <hi>A.</hi> to enter into the land of <hi>I. S.</hi>
and afterwards the Enfant entreth upon <hi>A. A</hi> is the Diſſeiſor and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and the Enfant gaineth nothing. So if <hi>A<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> entreth to the uſe of
the Enfant, and the Enfant afterwards agreeth to it, in this Caſe here is
but a bare contract; and an agreement will not make an Enfant a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeiſor:
No more ſhall he be bound by a bare Deed, or matter in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
without Livery. 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 2. An Enfant granteth an Advowſon, and
at full age confirmeth it, all is void. <hi>Br. Releaſes</hi> 49. Two Joynt-Tenants,
one being an Enfant releaſeth to his Companion, it is a void Releaſe.
<hi>18 E.</hi> 4. 7. An Enfant makes a Leaſe without reſerving Rent, or makes
a Deed of grant of goods, yet he ſhall maintain Treſpaſs; nay though
he deliver the goods, or Leaſe with his own hand, the ſame will not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
the Treſpaſs, nor will it perfect the Leaſe, or make the grant of the
goods good. If the Contract have but a mixture of prejudice to the

at his full age he accepts the Rent of the particular Tenant, it
is a good comfirmation of the eſtate of him in the remainder. <hi>Litt.

were void: and yet in that Caſe it doth not appear that there was any
Rent reſerved: The Enfant being a Copyholder makes no difference
in the Caſe. And in <hi>Murrels</hi> Caſe, <hi>C. 4. part,</hi> It is ſaid, That if a
Copyholder make a Leaſe not warrantable by the Cuſtome, it is a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture,
which proves it is a good Leaſe, otherwiſe it could not be a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture.

Caſe. A Copyholder makes a Leaſe for three years by word, to

he made a leaſe for 20 years, and left out the words (if he ſhould ſo
long live) yet becauſe he was a Copyholder for life, and ſo the leaſe did
determine by his death, and ſo he did no more then by Law he might
do, it was adjudged a good Leaſe, and no forfeiture; otherwiſe if he had
been a Copyholder in Fee. All Conditions in Fact ſhall bind an Enfant,
but not Conditions in Law. <hi>C. 8. part 44. Whittinghams</hi> Caſe, An En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant,
Tenant for life or years, makes a Feoffment in Fee, it is no forfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
For if the Leſſor entreth, the Enfant may enter upon him again;
yet it is a good Feoffment, but he ſhall avoid it by Enfancy; but if it be
by matter of Record, then it is otherwiſe: For if an Enfant be Leſſee
for life, and levieth a Fine, it is a forfeiture; and in that caſe if the Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor
enter for the forfeiture, the Enfant ſhall not enter again. The ſame
Law if an Enfant committeth Waſte which is againſt a Statute, it is a
forfeiture; and if the Leſſor recovereth the place waſted, the Enfant
ſhall not enter again. 9 <hi>H. 7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

had accepted the Rent at his full age, that the ſame had been good, for
that there he had a recompence; but being a Copyholder it is a queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

            <head>457. GEORGE BUSHER againſt MURRAY

            <p>A <hi>Scire facias</hi> was brought dated 28 <hi>Junii</hi> retornable in <hi>Mich.</hi> Term
<hi>2 Car. Regis,</hi> why Execution ſhould not be awarded againſt the
Defendant upon a Iudgment had againſt him in this Court. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant
pleaded, That King <hi>Charles, 7 Octob.</hi> in the ſecond year of his
Reign, did take him into his protection for a year, and did grant unto
him that during that time he ſhould be free from all manner of Plaints
but <hi>Dower, Quare Impedit,</hi> and <hi>Placit. coram Juſticiariis Itinerantibus.</hi>
It was ſaid that this Protection was not warrantable by Law for three
cauſes. 1. Becauſe it is after the purchaſe of the <hi>Scire facias,</hi> and before
the Retorn. 10 <hi>H. 6. 3. 11 H.</hi> 4. 7. A Protection depending the Suit
is not allowable, although it make mention that the party is to go a

cauſe why the Protection was granted unto him. All our books
do expreſs a cauſe, <hi>viz. Quia moratur &amp;c. quia profecturus &amp;c.</hi> Regiſter

The particular cauſe ought to be in the Protection. A Protection being

            <p>IN Treſpaſs for entring into his Cloſe called <hi>Dipſon</hi> in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> upon
Not guilty pleaded, the Jury gave a ſpecial verdict, That the ſaid Cloſe

and that the ſame was granted to <hi>G. Starling</hi> in Fee by Copy of

That no Copyholder by the Cuſtome could make any Eſtate <hi>in feodo,</hi>

            <p>Firſt they ſaid, That Copyholds are not within the letter of the

Secondly, they are not within the meaning of it: 1. Becauſe they were
not untill 7 E. 4. 19. of any accompt in Law, becauſe they were but

could not do. 3. Becauſe if Copyholders might give lands in tail by the

<pb n="368" facs="tcp:40982:184"/>
4. The Makers of the Statute did not intend any thing to be within the

Surrender was unto the uſe of one in tail, with divers remainders over
in tail: The firſt Surrenderee dyed without iſſue; And firſt it was
agreed and adjudged, That it was no diſcontinuance. 2. If it were a
diſcontinuance, yet a <hi>Formedon</hi> in the Remainder did not lie, becauſe
there ought to be a Cuſtom to warrant the Remainder as well as the firſt
Eſtate tail: For when a Copyholder in Fee maketh ſuch a gift, no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
is left in him, but only a poſſibility; And the Lord ought to
avow upon the Donee, and not upon the Donor. And there is a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
when he maketh or giveth an eſtate of inheritance, and when he
maketh a Leaſe for life or years; for in the one caſe he hath a Reverſion,
in the other not. 2. A Recovery ſhall not be without a ſpecial cuſtom,
as it was agreed in the Caſe of the Mannor of <hi>Stepney,</hi> becauſe the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantie

to warrant it. <hi>Mich. 36 &amp; 37 Eliz.</hi> in the Kings Bench it was adjudged,
That a Copyholder could not ſuffer a common Recovery; and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
was, becauſe that the Recovery in value is by reaſon of the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantie
annexed to the Eſtate at the Common-Law, which could not
be annexed to a Cuſtomary eſtate: And another reaſon was given, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that he who recovers in value, ſhall be in by the Recovery, and
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:40982:184"/>
the Copy of the Court-Roll only ſhould not be his Evidence, as <hi>Littleton</hi>

<hi>Donis</hi> was made in reſtraint of the Common-Law. And it ſhould be very
diſadvantagious to the Lord, if Copyhold ſhould be conſtrued to be
within that Statute. And therefore he conceived that the ſaid Statute
did not extend to Copyholds by any equitable conſtruction.</p>
            <p>And ſuch difference was taken by <hi>Popham</hi> Chief Juſtice, 42 <hi>Eliz.</hi> in

That a Cuſtom which did conduce to maintain Copyholds, did extend
to them; But a Statute or a Cuſtom which did deprave or deſtroy them,
did not. As if one ſurrender to the uſe of one for life, the Remainder
in Fee, where the Cuſtom is to ſurrender in Fee, the Cuſtom doth not
extend thereunto, becauſe a Cuſtom which goes in deſtruction of a
Copyhold ſhall be taken ſtrictly. But if a man be Copyholder in Fee,
he may grant a Fee conditional.</p>

            <p>JUdgment was given in the Common-Pleas againſt Sir <hi>William Fiſh;</hi>
and after the year and day Execution was awarded by <hi>Capias,</hi> where it
ought to have been by a <hi>Scire facias</hi> firſt: And the Plaintiff was taken in
Execution, and brought a Writ of Error in this Court, where the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

was not warrantable, the Proceſs being erronious. And out of
the Kings Bench another Execution was awarded by <hi>Capias ſicut alias,</hi>
within the year of the affirmance of the Judgment in the Kings Bench.
And it was moved by <hi>Banks,</hi> That the Execution was erronious, becauſe
he ought to have a <hi>Scire facias,</hi> becauſe the year is paſt after the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the Common-Pleas; and although that the Court be changed,
yet the Plaintiffe ought to have the ſame Proceſs for Execution as he
ought to have in the firſt Court. 14 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 15. The firſt Proceſs was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed

Sir <hi>William Fiſh</hi> had a Releaſe, and that was the cauſe that

to proceed with effect. In this caſe the body is diſcharged of Execution
as to any Proceſs to take the body, unleſs he render himſelf to priſon of

who recovereth hath no remedy but to make the Sureties to pay the

               <hi>Danby,</hi> The Plantiffe ſhall not have Debt, for at the beginning
when the Defendant was in Execution, the Action of Debt was gone;

To which <hi>Needham</hi> agreed. And <hi>Choke</hi> ſaid, He did not know any

Execution. 14 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 1. If one eſcape out of Execution, the Plaintiffe
cannot take him again in Execution, but his remedy is againſt the Gaoler.
The Court may <hi>ſuperſedeat</hi> this Execution, becauſe it is erronious:
<hi>34 H. 6. 45. b.</hi> An Action of Debt was brought againſt an Executor,
who pleaded that he had fully adminiſtred; And it was found that he
had Aſſets, and Judgment was given againſt the Defendant, and a <hi>Capias</hi>
was awarded againſt him, and after that an <hi>Exigent:</hi> And the Court
granted a <hi>Superſedeas,</hi> to ſuperſede that Erronious proceſs; For a <hi>Capias</hi>

ſhall have a <hi>Capias</hi> although the Judgment be affirmed two years after
the bringing of the Writ of Error: For he ſhall take the ſame Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution

although in the Common Pleas he cannot have a <hi>Capias,</hi> becauſe the
year is paſt: For we are not to reſpect what proceſs he ought to have in
the Common Pleas; but after the year of the Judgment affirmed here,
the partie is to have a <hi>Scire facias. Jones</hi> Juſtice ſaid, That when he was

which <hi>Banks</hi> cited are Law, but are not well applyed. The whole Court
was of opinion, That if the Common Pleas award erronious proceſs,
the Court cannot award a <hi>Superſedeas;</hi> but the partie is put to his VVrit

            <p>IN an Action of <hi>Trover</hi> and <hi>Converſion,</hi> The Plaintiff did lay it, that
he was poſſeſſed of twenty Loads of Wheat, and that he loſt them,
and that they came to the Defendants hands, who converted the ſame
to his own uſe. The Defendant did juſtifie and ſaid, That the Pariſh of
<hi>O.</hi> is an ancient Pariſh, in which there is a Rectorie impropriate, &amp;c. and
the Earl of <hi>Clare</hi> was ſeiſed of the Rectorie, and made a Leaſe unto
him of the Tythes of that Pariſh for one year, by force of which he was
poſſeſſed; and that the Corn was ſet forth by the Pariſhoners, and that
one <hi>T.</hi> gathered the Tythe, and delivered the ſame to the Plaintiff, and
that the Defendant his Servant took away the Tythe as it was lawfull
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:40982:187"/>
for him to do: Upon which the Plaintiff did demurr; Firſt becauſe the
Plea did amount to no more then the general iſſue, <hi>viz.</hi> Not guilty: and
if the Plea do amount to no more then the general iſſue, then it is no
good plea; but he ought to have taken the general iſſue. 5 <hi>H. 7. 11. Aſſ.</hi>
For if in an Aſſiſe the Tenant ſaith that the Plaintiff did diſſeiſe him, and
that he entred upon him, the plea is not good, becauſe it amounts but to
the general iſſue, <hi>viz. Nul lort nul diſſeiſin,</hi> and the other party may
demurr upon it. 22 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 40. In Treſpaſs for Batterie, it is no plea to
ſay that he did not beat him, becauſe it is but Not guilty by Argument.

good plea to ſay that I have no Cloſe; or if it be for carrying away my
Goods, to ſay that I had not any Goods; but the Party ought to have
pleaded Not guilty.</p>
            <p>It may be objected, That in this Caſe the Defendant makes Title to
the Corn. To that we ſay, He derives a Title to Tythes without a Deed,
which gives no title to them; For Tythes do not paſs by Demiſe alone
without Deed; but by the demiſe of the Rectorie without Deed they
will paſs: So by a Feoffment of a Mannor without Deed the Services
will paſs; but the Services alone will not paſs without a Deed. 21 <hi>H. 7.

But the profits of Courts will not paſs without Deed. 22 <hi>H. 6. 34. b.</hi> By

them, and made him Executor, &amp;c. And the Plaintiff did demurre, and
had Judgment, becauſe it amounted but to the generall Iſſue. <hi>Dodde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridge</hi>
Juſtice; The Parſon may demiſe his Tythe to the Owner of the
Land without Deed; but he cannot grant them to a ſtranger without
Deed. If the Defendant make Title from a ſtranger, then it doth
amount to the generall Iſſue; but if both Plaintiff and Defendant make
Title from one Perſon or Donor, then the plea is a good plea. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
<hi>per Curiam,</hi> it doth amount to the generall Iſſue. But the Opinion
of the Court was, becauſe that the Defendant did make a title of Tythes
without a Deed; therefore Judgment in the principall Caſe was given

to <hi>C.</hi> in Fee, who conveyed the ſame to <hi>Brooker,</hi> and <hi>Brooker</hi> brought
a Writ of Error to reverſe the Outlawry againſt <hi>Henry Iſley. Holborn</hi>
argued for the King, and ſaid that <hi>Brooker</hi> was no way privy to the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taindor
of <hi>Henry Iſley,</hi> but a meer ſtranger, and therefore could not
maintain a Writ of Error; And firſt he ſaid, and took exception, that
he had not ſet himſelf down Terre-Tenant in poſſeſſion. Secondly,
he ſaith in his Writ of Error, That the Mannor and Lands deſcended
to <hi>Henry Iſley</hi> as ſon and heir, when as he was attainted. The third ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
was, That he ſaith that <hi>Henry Iſley</hi> did deviſe the Lands, and that

have Error, becauſe the Lands are not extended in his hands. Alſo it is

For if <hi>Henry Iſley</hi> had died without iſſue in the life of his father, the
youngeſt ſon ſhould have had the Land by diſcent; which proves that it
works not upon the Land, but upon the perſon. <hi>Bankes</hi> for the Plaintiff,
and he deſired that the <hi>Outlawrie</hi> might be reverſed: As this Caſe is,
there is no other perſon who can maintain Error. <hi>Henry Iſley</hi> had his
pardon before the <hi>Outlawrie,</hi> but he came not in to plead it; and now
having enjoyed it ſo long a time, we hope a Purchaſor ſhall be favoured
before him who beggs a concealed title. The firſt Exception was taken:
To the Deviſe by a perſon attainted. I anſwer, That that is but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance
to the Writ of Error. Secondly it was ſaid, that none but
privies or parties could maintain Error; and the adverſe partie would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

he would diſable the Feoffees and make them as ſtrangers. Firſt the

            <p>AN Action upon the Caſe was brought in the Common-Pleas by an
Enfant who declared by Attorney. The Defendant brought a
Writ of Error in the Kings Bench, and aſſigned the ſame for Error,
For he ought to have declared <hi>per Prochyn amy,</hi> and not by Attorney.
If an Action be brought, and the Defendant plead that he is an Enfant,
the Enfancie is to be tryed where the Writ is brought. Here he
aſſigns the Error in fact that he was an Enfant, and ſhewed no place
where he was an Enfant, and ſo no place ſet where to prove it. To this
Error the Plaintiffe pleaded, That he was at full age. And upon that
they are at iſſue upon this matter in fact. And it was tryed at <hi>Halſworth</hi>
in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> whereas it ought to have been in this Court where the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancie
is pleaded, becauſe he names no place where he was of full age.
And notwithſtanding that it was found that he was of full age, yet the
Trial was not good. The firſt Action was brought before the Statute
of 21 <hi>Jacobi, cap.</hi> 13.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hitcham</hi> Serjeant, Age or not age is not local; and a place muſt be
ſet down for formalitie ſake, and ſo it is no matter of ſubſtance. And
the <hi>Venire facias</hi> might be awarded from the place where the firſt Action
was, <hi>viz.</hi> at <hi>Halſworth</hi> in <hi>Suffolk:</hi> For that is a matter dependant and
purſuant the firſt Action, and now ſince the Statute is helped. <hi>Denny</hi>
contrary, It hath no dependance upon the firſt Action, but is a new
thing ſprung up. If any place had been ſet down, and the <hi>Venire facias</hi>
had been miſtaken, that is helped by the Statute, and not where no place
is ſet down at all. <hi>Whitlock</hi> Juſtice, Every <hi>Venire facias</hi> properly is
to be from the place where the Writ is brought, unleſs it be drawn away
by Plea. He ought to have alleadged a place; For this is a new matter
in this Court, and not helped by the Statute of 21 <hi>Jacobi,</hi> nor any other,
for the <hi>Venire facias</hi> is totally miſtaken. <hi>Dodderidge</hi> Juſtice, The Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:40982:191"/>
of <hi>Jeofaites</hi> have ever been taken ſtrictly according to the letter:
For if they had been taken by equity, what need had there been of more
Statutes to have been made? The want of a letter out of a word, is out
of the Statutes <hi>C. 8. part.</hi> You ſhould have alleadged ſome place.
The Statute of 21 <hi>Jacobi</hi> is not of any <hi>Venire facias</hi> which is miſawarded
generally: but the Statute helpeth when there are two places, and the
<hi>viſne</hi> ought to come from both places, and the <hi>viſne</hi> comes but from
one place; and when there is but one place, and the viſne comes from
two places. If Enfancie be to be tryed <hi>(ſc.)</hi> If he were at ſuch a time
within age, it ought to be tryed by the Country. This matter is collateral
to the firſt Record, and it is a new Record <hi>(ſc.)</hi> upon Error.</p>
            <p>The whole Court was of opinion that it was out of the Statute, and
a Repleader was granted. <hi>Whitlock</hi> Juſtice, There is no Trial at all,
for there is no <hi>Venire facias</hi> at all. <hi>Dodderidge</hi> Juſtice, If the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
in Error plead an ill plea, he ſhall replead: But if in this Action he
had alleadged a place of his Enfancie <hi>(ſc.)</hi> at <hi>Dale,</hi> and the <hi>Venire facias</hi>
had been of <hi>Sale,</hi> there it had been good trial; and there he ſhould not
replead, for that he hath pleaded well; but there he ſhall have a <hi>Venire

If the Leſſor ſhall put him out as a Diſſeiſor by reaſon of the Recovery
in the action of Debt, in which he hath admitted him to be Leſſee for
years: Or if the Leſſor after he hath recovered in Debt dyeth, whether
his heir ſhall be eſtopped by the Record to ſay otherwiſe then that he
is in by the Leaſe; Or whether the Recovery in Debt hath purged the
wrong. Like unto the Caſe 14 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 12. by <hi>Carret.</hi> If one entreth into
my lands, and claims 20 years therein, and I ſuffer him to continue there
and accept of the Rent, and afterwards he committeth Waſte, I ſhall
maintain an action of Waſte, and declare upon the ſpecial matter.
If one entreth into my Land claiming a Leaſe for years, <hi>per Curiam</hi> he
is a Diſſeiſor, and he cannot qualifie his own wrong, <hi>Dyer 134. Traps</hi> caſe.

But he hath not but for years, in reſpect of his claim: But I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded

So here by the bringing of the action of Debt, the Leſſor is concluded.

            <p>AN action of Debt was brought for ſuing in the Court of Admiralty

ſhall in no wiſe have conuſans: And the Statute gives damages, part
to the party, and part to the King. And the Plaintiff in the action of Debt
did declare. That the Defendant <hi>Tookley</hi> did implead <hi>Cremer</hi> the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff
in the Court of Admiralty; And in his Declaration ſet forth, That
one <hi>Mull<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Court. And by ſpecial Verdict it was found, That a Charter-party was
made betwixt <hi>Mullibeck</hi> and <hi>Cremer</hi> at <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> And that <hi>Tookley</hi> did
proſecute <hi>Cremer</hi> in the Admiral Court by vertue of a Letter of Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney;
and ſo that he as Attorney to <hi>Mullibeck</hi> did proſecute the ſuit there.
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:40982:193"/>
The Caſe was argued by <hi>Andrewes</hi> for the Plaintiff. There are two
points: The firſt upon the Juriſdiction of the Admiralty, the Contract
being made at <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> but to be performed in <hi>England:</hi> The ſecond,
If <hi>Tookley</hi> being the Attorney, be ſuch a party proſecutor as is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Statutes. The ancient Law of the Admirals Juriſdiction appears
in our Books. 8 <hi>E. 2. Corone 399. Staunton</hi> Juſtice, It ſhall not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
the Sea, where a man may ſee the land over the water: And the
Coroners were to do their office in ſuch caſe, and the County was to
take notice thereof, 40 <hi>Aſſ. 25. Stamford</hi> 11. This Commiſſion was at
the Common-Law before the Statutes of Pyracie. 46 <hi>E. 3. tras. 38.
Statham</hi> It is pleaded that the Defendant took the goods as Pyracie, &amp;c.
I infer thereupon that it was a good Juſtification. 7 <hi>R. 2. tras 54. Stat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>am,</hi>
Treſpaſs was brought for a Ship and Merchandiſes taken upon the
Sea, and holden good; which proves that the Common-Law had ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction
upon the Sea, and not the Admiral. 6 <hi>R. 2. Protection 46. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
quia profecturus ſuper altum mare. Belknap,</hi> The Sea is within
the Kings juriſdiction; and the Sea is as well in the Kings protection
as is the Land.</p>
            <p>It may be objected, That the Contract was made at <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> and
ſo out of the body of the County, and ſo our Law cannot take notice
of it; and if the Admiral ſhall not have jurisdiction in ſuch caſe, it
ſhould remain undetermined. To that I anſwer, If all the matter were
to be done at <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> then all were a Marine caſe, and the Admiral
ſhould have juriſdiction; but if any part were to be done in <hi>England,</hi>
then it is otherwiſe. <hi>M. 30, 31 Eliz. C. 6: part</hi> 47. in <hi>Dowdalos</hi> caſe. In an
Action upon the Caſe upon <hi>Aſſumpſit,</hi> the Plaintiff did declare, That
the Defendant at <hi>London</hi> did aſſume that ſuch a ſhip ſhould ſail from
<hi>Melcomb Regis</hi> in <hi>Suffolk</hi> to <hi>Abvile</hi> in <hi>France:</hi> The iſſue was tryed in
<hi>London,</hi> becauſe the Contract was made in <hi>England. Paſch. 28 Eliz.
Gynne</hi> and <hi>Conſtantines</hi> Caſe: there becauſe it was part upon the Sea,
and part upon the Land, the tryal was at the Common-Law, and not in
the Admiral Court. 48 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 2. One did retein three Eſquires to ſerve
in <hi>France;</hi> there becauſe the Reteiner was here, the tryal was here.
If a Mariner contract with me for wages to ſail in ſuch a ſhip, he ſhall
demand his wages at the Common-Law, and not in the Admiral Court.
<hi>vi. 39 H.</hi> 6. 39. There a Protection <hi>ſuper vetilationem Caliſiae, &amp;c.</hi> cannot
be <hi>moraturus,</hi> becauſe that the Sea is ever ebbing and flowing, and doth
not ſtand ſtill. So that if any part of the Contract be to be done upon
the Land, then Common-Law ſhall have the juriſdiction. Wreck of
the Sea ſhall be tryed at the Common-Law, becauſe it is caſt upon the
Land. <hi>Dyer 326. t' E. 1. Avowry</hi> 192. A <hi>Replevin</hi> was brought of a
ſhip taken upon the coaſt of <hi>Scarborough,</hi> and carried into <hi>Norfolk;</hi>
and it was alleadged to be within the Statute of <hi>Malebridge</hi> for taking
a Diſtreſs in one County, and carrying of it into another County.
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:40982:193"/>
               <hi>Bereford,</hi> The King wills that the Peace be kept as well upon the Sea as
upon the Land. And our Caſe differs from <hi>Lacy's</hi> caſe, <hi>C. 2. part:</hi> Fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
in that caſe of Felony it is meer local; but Contracts are not ſo local.
The ſecond point, Whether this be a proſecution within the Statutes,
becauſe it was done by vertue of a Letter of Attorney from <hi>Mullibeck.
32 E. 3. barr. 264. Annuity 51. Qui per alium facit, per ſeipſum facere

make a Letter of Attorney to make Livery and Seiſin, and the Attorney

have not juriſdiction of the Cauſe, the Miniſter muſt look to it at his
peril, otherwiſe he is puniſhable. <hi>Tras.</hi> 253. One may do that himſelf,
which he cannot do by Attorney: The Lord may beat his villein, but
a ſtranger cannot do it for the Lord: the Lord may diſtrein for Rent
when it is not behind, and the Tenant ſhall not have treſpaſs; but if the
Bailiff diſtrein when no Rent is arrear, treſpaſs lieth againſt him. 2 <hi>H. 4.
4. 9 H.</hi> 7. 14. In Treſpaſs all are Principals. Then the Attorney here
and <hi>Mullibeck</hi> are both Treſpaſſors againſt the Statutes: And the doing
of the Attorney at the command of the Maſter ſhall not avail him.
<hi>vi. Dyer</hi> 159. doth conduce to the reaſon, that the Attorney ſhall be
puniſhed. It ſeems this ſuing in the Court of Admiralty is a Contempt,
for it is <hi>malum prohibitum;</hi> and ſo either <hi>Mullibeck</hi> or the Attorney are
puniſhable. And in this caſe the Plaintiff hath his Election to ſue <hi>Mulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck</hi>
or the Attorney; and therefore having ſued the Attorney, the
Action brought againſt him will well lie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Calthrop</hi> for the Defendant. It was objected, That the Court of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty
did begin but in the time of King <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. But <hi>Dyer</hi> 152. proves
the contrary: For there in an Aſſiſe brought of the Office of Admiralty,
the Plaintiff doth declare the ſame to be an Office time out of mind &amp;c.
which proves it to be a more ancient Office: And in the Statute of
<hi>2 H. 5. cap.</hi> 6. There the words are to enquire of all offences &amp;c. as the
Admirals after the old cuſtom; which proves that it is an ancient Office.
It's true, <hi>Avowry</hi> 192. makes againſt me; but the Notes of that Caſe
in writing proves that the book is miſprinted. I confeſs, if part of the
thing be to be done here upon the Land, that it is triable at the Common-Law.
The Defendant in this our Caſe is not liable to the penalty, becauſe
at the time of the making of theſe Statutes it was not known that any
Charter-partie was made beyond the Seas. 2 <hi>E. 3. Oblig.</hi> 15. Debt was
brought upon an Obligation made at <hi>Barwick;</hi> where becauſ this Court
had not juriſdiction, It was adjudged, That the Plaintiff <hi>nihil capiat per
breve. Teſtament</hi> 16. A Teſtament bore date at <hi>Cane</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi>
               <pb n="388" facs="tcp:40982:194"/>
which was proved in <hi>England: Pole,</hi> Upon an Obligation which bears
date in <hi>Normandy,</hi> a man ſhall not have an Action here; but it is good
in caſe of a Will proved here. 6 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 17, 18. The Abbot of <hi>Crowband</hi>
granted an Annuity, and the Deed was made in <hi>Scotland:</hi> If the Deed
had been the ground of the Action, then the Action would not have lien;
but becauſe the Deed bore date before time of memory, the Annuity
did lie; for the Action was not brought upon the Deed, but upon the
Preſcription. 1 <hi>E. 3. 1. 18. 8 E.</hi> 3. 51. It is ruled, where the title is made
by a Deed which bears date beyond Sea, that the Action will not lie.
<hi>13 H.</hi> 4. 5 &amp; 6. An Obligation bore date in <hi>France,</hi> and was made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Law of <hi>France. 6 R. 2 cap.</hi> 2. Where the Specialtie bears
date, there the Action ſhall be brought. The firſt book that ſpeaks of
Deeds bearing date out of <hi>England, 20 H. 6. 28, 29. 20 E. 4. 1. 21 E</hi> 4. 72.
You muſt ſuppoſe then, That it was at a place in <hi>England;</hi> and that is
but a fiction of Law, and you ſhall never make a man ſubject to the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty
of a Statute upon a fiction of Law. <hi>C. 11. part</hi> 51. A Diſſeiſor
makes a Leaſe for life or years; the Diſſeiſee ſhall not not have an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Treſpaſs <hi>vi &amp; armis</hi> againſt him, becauſe he comes in by title:
For this fiction of Law, That the Frank-tenement hath always been in
the Diſſeiſee, ſhall not have Relation to make him who comes in by title
to be a Treſpaſſor <hi>vi &amp; armis. 18 H.</hi> 6. 23. A Reverſion is expectant
upon an eſtate for life; and in the mean time betwixt the Grant and
the Attornment the Leſſee commits Waſte: yet although the Attorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
relate to make the Grant good <hi>ab initio,</hi> yet the Relation being a
fiction of Law will not make the Leſſee puniſhable for Waſte. Then in
this our Caſe, the Deed bears date beyond the Sea; and then to make
<hi>Dunkirk</hi> to be in <hi>England</hi> by a fiction in Law, ſhall not be prejudicial to
the Defendant. <hi>Com.</hi> 369. The preamble of a Statute is the beſt Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter
of the Statute. In the Statute of 13 <hi>R.</hi> 2. the preamble ſaith,
<hi>Becauſe the Admirals and their Deputies do hold their Seſſions &amp;c. in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
of the King and of the Common-Law, and in deſtruction of the common
people, &amp;c.</hi> But this Deed bearing date beyond the Sea, is no prejudice
to the King, nor to his Franchiſes, nor to his people to be ſued in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty.
<hi>32 H. 8. cap.</hi> 14. The ſuit within the Admiralty ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
Charter-partie, and Fraighting of a Ship. For by that Statute it was
enacted, That if any Merchant-ſtranger (as <hi>Mullibeck</hi> was) by long
delaying and protracting of time (As in our Caſe) otherwiſe then was
agreed between the ſaid Merchants in or by the ſaid Charter-partie, &amp;c.
ſhall have his remedy before the Admiral<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which Lord Admiral ſhall
take ſuch Order, &amp;c. In our Caſe at Bar, It was a Charter-partie made
beyond Sea. 2. It was for the freighting of a Ship. 3. For the
breach of it was the the ſuit in the Court of Admiralty. But admit that
this point be againſt me, then for the ſecond point I do conceive<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that
he who is puniſhable by the Statutes muſt be Proſecutor, which the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:40982:194"/>
is not; for what he hath done, he did by vertue of a Letter of
Attorney, and he did it in the name of another, and it is the Act of the
other. <hi>C. 9. part 76. Combes</hi> Caſe, If a man have power to do an Act by
force of a Letter of Attorney, it ought to be done in the name of him
who gives the power. 3 <hi>Ma. Dyer</hi> 132. If Surveyors have power to
make Leaſes, if they make the Leaſes in their own names, it is not good;
but they ought to be made in his name who giveth the power. 11 <hi>Eliz.
Dyer</hi> 283 The Statute of <hi>R.</hi> 3. giveth power to <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe</hi> to make
Leaſes, and he makes a Letter of Attorney, the Attorney muſt make
the Leaſes in the name of <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe,</hi> who hath the power by the
Statute. C 9. part 75. A Copyholder may ſurrender by Attorney, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is his own ſurrender. <hi>Vi Perkins</hi> 196. 199. A Feoffment
with a Letter of Attorney to the wife to make Livery, is good;
but then the wife muſt make the Livery in the name of her husband.
Secondly, in this Caſe at Barr, the beginning and the proſecution of
the Suit was altogether for the benefit of <hi>Mullibeck,</hi> and ſo it appears
by the Records of the Court, and no notice is there taken of the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney
but of the Maſter. <hi>L. 5. E.</hi> 45. A Writ is directed to the Sheriff,
and the Under-Sheriff makes a falſe retorn, the Sheriff ſhall be amerced;
and not the Under-Sheriff, for the Law doth not take notice of him.
<hi>7 Eliz. Dyer</hi> 239. The Cuſtomer himſelf and not his Deputie, ſhall be
charged. And ſo in our Caſe <hi>Mullibeck</hi> being partie to the whole, ought
to be accounted the partie proſecuting within the words of the Statutes.
The Statute of 4 <hi>H. 7. cap.</hi> 27. is ſo as they purſue their claims with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
five years; ſuch proſecuting or purſuing ought to be by the partie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
<hi>C. 9. part</hi> 106. If one of his own head make claim, it is not good

Caſe it is not ſo; for if our Statute had intended to extend to Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors,
Attornies, &amp;c. it would have expreſly named them. There are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
exceptions which I take to the Verdict Firſt, There is variance in
the place, betwixt the Declaration and the ſpecial Verdict; for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
layeth the Contract to be made at <hi>Dunkirk</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and the
ſpecial Verdict finds it to be made at <hi>Dunkirk extra partes tranſmarinas.</hi>
Secondly, The Declaration is to take in Mariners, and the ſpecial Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
is to take in Men. Thirdly the Declaration is, A Ship to be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and the Verdict is to be in readineſs. Fourthly, The Statute of

            <p>AN Action of Debt was brought upon the Statute of 2 <hi>E.</hi> 6. and
the Plaintiff declared, That at the time of the Action brought, he
was Parſon of <hi>Merrel,</hi> and that <hi>Weſton</hi> the Defendant did occupie ſuch
Lands, and ſowed them with corn. <hi>Anno 21 Jac.</hi> and that he did not fet
forth his Tythe-corn, &amp;c. The Defendant pleaded in barr of the Action,
That <hi>W. W.</hi> Prior of the Hoſpital of St <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> was of the
Order of Hoſpitalers, &amp;c. and that he held the ſaid Lands free from
the payment of Tythes, and that the Priory came by the Statute of
<hi>32. H.</hi> 8. to the King: By vertue of which Statute the King was ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
thereof, and that the ſame deſcended to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Lands unto <hi>Weſton</hi> to hold as amply as the late Prior held, and
that he was ſeiſed of the Lands by vertue of that grant, <hi>Et propriis
manibus ſuis excolebat.</hi> Upon this Plea the Plaintiff did demurr in Law.
<hi>Noy</hi> argued for the Plantiff, There are three points in the Caſe. Firſt, If
theſe Lands the poſſeſſions of the Hoſpitalers of St <hi>John,</hi> which they held
in their own hands were diſcharged of Tythes. Secondly, If there be
any thing in the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. by which the Purchaſor of the
King ſhould be diſcharged. Thirdly, Admitting that it ſhall be a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge,
if the Defendant hath well entitled himſelf to ſuch diſcharge
or Priviledg. Firſt it is not within the Statute of 31 <hi>H. 8: cap.</hi> 13. for
that Statute did not extend to the Order of St <hi>John.</hi> Secondly, the
Statute of 31 <hi>H. 8. cap.</hi> 13. doth not diſcharge any but what was
then diſſolved. Thirdly, The Statute of 32 <hi>H. 8 cap.</hi> 24. gives the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions
of the Hoſpitalers of St <hi>Johns</hi> to the King, and not the Statute
of 31 <hi>H.</hi> 8. Note that the Defendant did recite the branch of the
Statute of 31 <hi>H. 8. cap</hi> 13. That as well the King, his heirs and ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors,
as all and every ſuch perſon and perſons their heirs and aſſignes,
which have or hereafter ſhall have any Monaſterie, &amp;c. or other Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious

their Eſtates and Titles diſcharged and acquitted of the payment of
Tythes, as freely and in as large and ample manner as the ſaid Abbots,
&amp;c. had or uſed: Alſo he recited the Statute of 32 <hi>H. 8. cap.</hi> 7 which
Enacts that none ſhall pay Tythes, who by Law, Statute, or Priviledg
ought to be diſcharged. The Statute of 31 <hi>H.</hi> 8. recites that divers
Abbies, &amp;c. and other Religious and Eccleſiaſtical houſes and places
have been granted and given up to the King: The Statute ena<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ts that

ſhall happen to be diſſolved, ſuppreſſed, renounced, relinquiſhed,

and condition they now be. <hi>Vi.</hi> The Statute. And ſhall have all
priviledges, &amp;c. in as ample manner and form as the late Abbots, &amp;c.
had, held or occupied, &amp;c. The Queſtion then is. Whether the men
of the Hoſpital of St <hi>John</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> are intended to be within the
ſaid Statute of 31 <hi>H.</hi> 8. And I conceive that they are not: It doth not
appear in the pleading, that the Priory of St <hi>John</hi> was an Eccleſiaſtical
Houſe, therefore it ought to have been averred. It is true, to plead
that ſuch a man hath entred into Religion, is intended that he is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
dead in Law. They were never Eccleſiaſtical, nor ſo accounted; they
muſt be both Religious and Eccleſiaſtical, who are within the Statute of
<hi>31 H.</hi> 8. For the ſaid Statute doth not extend to Religious houſes unleſs
they be Eccleſiaſtical. <hi>Tryal</hi> 99. proves that they were Religious,
<hi>21 H.</hi> 7. 7. And the Statute of Templers, 17 <hi>E.</hi> 2. do ſhew that they
were Canonized (which is) admitted unto a Rule of their own Law,
and not that they were made Saints, or that they were Eccleſiaſtical,
<hi>1 E. 3. 7. Nonability</hi> 4. They were dead perſons in Law. <hi>Feoffments</hi> 68.
proves that they were religious; but whether they were Lay or Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
I have not read. In the difference of Summons to Parliaments unto the
Templers, the Summons is, <hi>Vobis mandamus in fide &amp; legeanti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s;</hi> but the
Summons to a Spiritual Lord is, <hi>in fide &amp; electione;</hi> and ſo was the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
to the Prior of St <hi>Johns</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but that was becauſe he held
in <hi>Frankalmoign,</hi> but that doth not prove him to be Eccleſiaſtical; for firſt
they exerciſed themſelves in Arms, It was part of their Order, <hi>armis ſe
exercere;</hi> and that is againſt the Rule of the Common Law, to meddle
with blood. Secondly, They uſed no Impoſition of hands, but only a
Robe, nor had they ſo much Ceremony as a Knight of the Bath; and
yet the Knights of the Bath are not Eccleſiaſticall. So there is nothing
in their Creation or Order, that makes them Eccleſiaſtical; For they
were Lay-Monks of the Order of St <hi>Anthony.</hi> The Jeſuites have Lay-Brethren,
and not Eccleſiaſtical. 44. <hi>Aſſ.</hi> 9. There the Defendant plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in barr, That the Prior was a Lay-man, and ſo not under any Rule;
and it is there admitted that he was a Lay-man, and yet that he might be
Prior, and bring the Action in his own name, and not as Prior with his
brethren, which proves that the reſidue were dead perſons in Law. If
there be profeſſions alledged in one of the Hoſpitals of St <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi>
how ſhall it be tryed? By the Country. <hi>Tryal</hi> 99. Profeſſion
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:40982:197"/>
was alleadged in the Plaintiff, who was a Knight of the Order of the
Templers, and it was commanded to certifie it: And the Biſhop could
not enquire of it, becauſe the Order of a Knight Templer was exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Pope: But <hi>Tryal</hi> 98. there it was certified by the Biſhop;
yet all our books are contrary to it. 2. <hi>R. 3. 4. Si profiſſio allegata ſit in

material what they were accounted of in other places. A Colledg is a
Lay Corporation: If they be diſſeiſed, an Aſſiſe muſt be brought. The

a Deviſe was unto a Colledg and Grammar-School, and holden a good
Deviſe, becauſe the Statute of <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> ought to be favourably
expounded, being for the benefit of the Corporation. I take another
reaſon from the manner of payment of Tythes: Eccleſiaſtical perſons
payed Tythes; but no Tythes were paid by the Hoſpitalers of St <hi>Johns</hi>
of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> The Statute of 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. diſſolves Abbies, &amp;c. but doth not
relate to any formerly given up, &amp;c. and the reaſon was, becauſe they
were but petty Abbies. The Statute of 31 <hi>H.</hi> 8. diſſolves none; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites
that whereas divers have given up, &amp;c. or were to be given up, but
ſhews no reaſon; for divers inquiſitions iſſued forth to enquire of their
Lands; but the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. doth not ſhew any ſuch reaſons,
but other reaſons; becauſe that <hi>Rodes</hi> was taken away, and that they held
of the Pope. And if they were diſſolved by the Statute of 31 <hi>H.</hi> 8.
then what need a Statute the next year after, <hi>viz 32 H.</hi> 8. to diſſolve
the Corporation? By the Statute of 26 <hi>H. 8. cap.</hi> 3. the King hath the
firſt Fruits and Tenths of all that ſhall be promoted to any Benefice or
promotion ſpiritual. This doth not extend to <hi>St John</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and
therefore afterwards in the ſame Statute it is Enacted, That every one
which ſhall be elected, or by other means appointed to the Dignity of
the Prior of <hi>St Johns</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſhall before their real and actual
entrie into the Dignity or medling with the profits, ſatisfie the King, &amp;c.
Now if they were intended in the words <hi>Spiritual promotion,</hi> it was in
vain a new to enact for them. The Act of 32. <hi>H.</hi> 8. extends to <hi>Ireland,</hi>
and ſo doth not the Statute of 31 <hi>H.</hi> 8. the Statute of 31 <hi>H.</hi> 8. extends
only to Ecceleſiaſtical and Religious; ſo they were not intended within

ſome other Act, <hi>viz.</hi> forfeiture, ſurrender, or otherwiſe given up. The

doth not ſay that the Corporation ſhall be diſſolved and void. The

but not Eccleſiaſtical; and it was adjudged that the Purchaſors
of the Lands of the ſaid Colledg were not diſcharged from the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Tythes, becauſe the Colledg was not Eccleſiaſtical, but Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
only; and Religious and not Eccleſiaſtical, came not to the King

becauſe the Priory came not to the King by the Statute of
31 H. 8. and yet they were Tythe-free in the hands of the Prior him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>The ſecond point upon the Statute of 32 H. 8. The words are, That
the King ſhall have all Rights, Intereſts and Priviledg, as it was in the
hands of the Abbots, Priors, &amp;c. It is objected, To be free from pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Tythes is a Priviledg: I anſwer, That neither Right, Intereſt, nor
Priviledg do free him from the payment of Tythes: Firſt, there is no
diſcharge of Tythes by the word (Intereſt) in the Statute, for that is
plain; Then the queſtion is, if the word Priveledg will diſcharge the
Lands from the payment of Tythes; and if that word would have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:40982:198"/>
to have diſcharged the Tythe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what need was there of the ſpecial
Clauſe to diſcharge Tythes? The Statute of 27 H. 8. diſſolves Chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries,
and there it is ſaid, That the King ſhall have and enjoy, &amp;c. and
there alſo all Priviledges are given; then the Statute of 1 <hi>E.</hi> 6. came,
and gave all Chauntries to the King, and there the word (Priviledg) was
not in the Act; yet by thoſe words the Lands were not diſcharged from
the payment of Tythes: The Statute of 31 H. 8. is, Conditions and
Rights of Entrie; yet there was another Act made to give Conditions
to the King. But admit that the King himſelf be diſcharged, yet his
Patentees are not diſcharged. The Priviledg was perſonal, and perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Priviledges are not transferrable. 35 H. 6. 56. A Statute diſſolve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Templers, and gives the Lands to the Hoſpitalers to hold by the ſame
ſervice as the Templers did, which was <hi>Frankalmoign;</hi> yet the Grantee
held by Fealty, for that <hi>Frankalmoign</hi> is a perſonal priviledg, and cannot
be transferred by general words. The King (it's true) ſhall have the
priviledg, for he is a priviledged perſon: for of his goods he ſhall not
pay Tythes, if he do not grant them over: and the Grants prove, That
unleſs he had granted them, he ſhould have paid no Tythes. The Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of 31 H. 8. ſayes, All Conditions which the Abbots, &amp;c. have; yet
untill the Statute of 32 H<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 8. no Purchaſor could take advantage of a
Condition. <hi>Hill. 44. Eliz.</hi> in the Common Pleas, <hi>Rot. 1994. Spurlings</hi>

not appear whether they were of the Order of Templers or Ciſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians.</p>
            <p>The third point in this Caſe, The Defendant doth make no title to
the Diſcharge, for he hath not averred that the Priory were Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
perſons. If a man plead that A. is profeſſed, the Court cannot take
notice of it that he is a dead perſon in Law; But if he ſaith that he was
of ſuch an Order, he ought to ſet forth of what Rule the Order is. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
The manner of their diſcharge was, when they did Till and ſow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
their Lands, <hi>propriis ſumptibus &amp; manibus.</hi> If they grub up Roots,
and make the Lands fit for Tillage; but if their Tenants ſow the Lands,
they ſhall pay Tythes, for they had the priviledg in reſpect they ſhould
not be idle; unleſs all theſe do concur, they ſhall pay Tythes, <hi>viz.</hi>
plough, ſow, reap, and carrie the Corn. Theſe Priviledges are to be
taken ſtritly, becauſe they are to defeat the Church of her endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and therefore in this Caſe the Defendant doth not well entitle
himſelf to the Diſcharge, unleſs he do ſhew that he did occupie the Land
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:40982:198"/>
for one whole year before, and that he did plow, ſow, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eap the
corn; But he ought for to have ſhewed, that ſuch time he pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ed the
Land, ſuch a time he ſowed it, and ſuch a time he reaped the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
Otherwiſe the Court will intend that another man did plow and ſow the
land, and that he only reaped it: For if Leſſee of the Hoſpital doth
plow the Land, and ſow it, and afterwards doth ſurrender to the Prior
of the Hoſpital who reaps the ſame, he ſhall pay Tythe of the ſame, for
the Priviledge was granted unto them who were Labourers. And the
Defendant perhaps might have the Lands to halfs: that is to ſay, to
have half the Corn growing upon the Lands. The pleading is not good.
When you plead two Bars, each Bar muſt ſtand of it ſelf, and the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pluſage
of the one Bar ſhall not help the defect of the other Bar. The
word <hi>(Priviledge)</hi> in the Act of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. doth not extend to Tythes:
If it doth, yet the Purchaſor ſhall not have the Priviledge. <hi>Dodderidge</hi>
Juſtice, The Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. was made, becauſe that thoſe of <hi>S. Johns
of Jeruſalem</hi> ſaid, that they could not ſurrender their Hoſpital, becauſe
they had a Supreme Head over them, <hi>viz.</hi> their great Maſter the
Pope.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Crawley</hi> Serjeant argued for <hi>Weſton</hi> the Defendant. The pleading
was over-ruled to be good, the laſt day the Caſe was argued. We have
well entitled our ſelves to the Diſcharge: For we have pleaded that
we had the occupation of the Lands for one whole year; and that
<hi>Weſton</hi> the Defendant plowed, ſowed, and reaped the Corn upon the
lands at his own coſts and charges; And the Plaintiff hath not ſhewed
that any other plowed, ſowed, or reaped the ſame. Our title is by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription,
which is confeſſed. This Society was erected in the time of
King <hi>Henry</hi> the 1. and it continued untill 32 <hi>H. 8. 44 Eliz.</hi> in <hi>Spurlings</hi>
caſe, there were two reaſons of the Judgment. 1. There the Statute of
<hi>31 H.</hi> 8. was not found, and ſo the King was not entitled to rights and
priviledges, and by conſequence ſo was not his Pattentee. 2. It did not
appear that the Councel of <hi>Lateran (15 Johannis)</hi> did extend to theſe
Orders, which was ſaid to have been created 17 <hi>E.</hi> 3. whereas indeed it
was created in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the 1. Regularly this priviledge is
not transferrable, for it is <hi>ratione Ordinis:</hi> As when the King makes a
Duke, and gives to him poſſeſſions, thoſe poſſeſſions annexed to the
Dukedom are not transferrable over but by ſpecial Act of Parliament.
<hi>35 H. 6. 36. Moile,</hi> There if there had been ſpecial words in the Act of
Parliament, it had been <hi>Frankalmoigne.</hi> This Priviledge is transferred to
the King by the Act of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. and that Statute requires no aid of
Regular or Eccleſiaſtical perſons. Secondly, the words are ſpecial, <hi>And
all other things of theirs.</hi> This Caſe oppoſeth not the Biſhop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury's</hi>
Caſe, <hi>C. 3 part;</hi> For that refers to the Statute of 1 <hi>E.</hi> 6. which
had not ſo large words. The intent of an Act ſhall be taken largely and
beneficially to inlarge the Kings poſſeſſions; as the grants of the King
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:40982:199"/>
ſhall be taken largely and beneficially for the King. There is a difference
betwixt this Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. and the Statute of 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. The copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
words of the Statute of 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. are, <hi>To have all Rights and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts,
and Hereditaments. C. 11. part 13. pro omnibus demandis, &amp;c.</hi> there
the demand ſhall extend to Temporal demand; ſo, All rights and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,
and Inheritance, ſhall be conſtrued, All temporal rights, &amp;c.
But the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. is larger, <hi>viz. Of what name and nature
ſoever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If by the words of the Statute of 31 <hi>H. 8. (Priviledges)</hi> Tythes had
been given to the King without eſpecial proviſion after made, then what
needed the ſpecial Clauſe after? was the Objection which hath been
made. I anſwer, The ſpecial Clauſe was neceſſary: For in pleading
otherwiſe he ought to have ſhewed what Priviledge and Diſcharge it
was in particular; and ſo the Clauſe was added for the caſe of pleading<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <hi>C. 9. part,</hi> The Abbot of <hi>Strata Mercellos</hi> caſe; there it is ſaid, That if
a man plead to have ſuch priviledges as ſuch a one had, he ought to ſhew
in particular what thoſe priviledges were: But this proviſion in the
Statute of 31 <hi>H.</hi> 8. was made for the benefit of pleading. The Statute
of 17 <hi>E.</hi> 2. which gave the Tythes to the Hoſpitalers, give them by the
word of Priviledges, for they had their poſſeſſions as it were by a new
purchaſe. <hi>Cook Entries</hi> 450. there the Caſe much differs from this:
ſo then the general word (Priviledges) doth extend to Tythes. 14 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 2.
By a grant of All trees, Apple-trees will not paſs; yet if it be of all trees
<hi>cujuscunque generis, naturae, nominis aut qualitatis,</hi> then they will paſs.
<hi>C. 3. part</hi> 81. By grant of all goods, Apparel will not paſs. Here are ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
words in the Statute, <hi>cujuſcunque naturae, nominis, &amp;c. Nominla ſunt
ſymboa rerum:</hi> And then call them what you will they are given to the
King, and intended to be transferred to the King; and ſo there needs no
ſpecial proviſion for the diſcharge of the Tythes; For to ſay, that the
Priory was of the Order of the <hi>Ciſtertians,</hi> is ſufficient.</p>
            <p>Admit then that the King ſhall have the Tythes, as I have argued he
ſhall; then his Pattentee ſhall have them. It is a real diſcharge in the
King, and not a diſcharge in reſpect of his perſon only. Priviledges of
diſcharge may be transferred as well as Priviledges of profit. Then the
queſtion further is, Whether they of <hi>S. Johns of Jeruſalem</hi> were Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical?
They were Regular, as appeareth by the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8.
for that ſaith that they ſhall be free from Obedience. <hi>Trin. 8. Jacobi</hi>

<pb n="399" facs="tcp:40982:199"/>

viz.</hi> that he hath nothing within the City by which he may be ſummon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and <hi>Non eſt inventus;</hi> And if he be ſolemnly called at the next
Court, and makes default, that then if he can ſhew that the Defendant
hath goods in the hands of one within the Liberty of the City, that the
ſaid goods ſhall be attached: And if the Defendant make default at four
Court-dayes, being ſolemnly called, that then if the Plaintiff will ſwear
his Debt, and put in Bail for the goods, <hi>viz.</hi> That if the Debt be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
within one year and a day, or the Judgment be reverſed, That he
he ſhall have Judgment for the ſaid goods. And he ſhewed, That he
entred his plaint againſt the now Plaintiff in the Counter of <hi>Woodſtreet</hi>
for the Debt of 20<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. and that a Precept was awarded to a Sergeant at
Mace to ſummon him; And becauſe he had not any thing by which he

the Defendants hands, which were attached in his hands: And that he
ſware his Debt, and put in bail for the goods, and had Judgment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.
Upon which Plea the Plaintiff did demur in Law.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ward</hi> argued for the Plaintiff. There are four Reaſons of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murrer.
1. He ſets forth, That <hi>J. S.</hi> did levy a plaint againſt the now
Plaintiff for the Debt of 20<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. but doth not ſet forth expreſly that he did
owe him 20<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. And he ought to have ſet down how the Debt grew due;
for that is traverſable by the Plaintiff, and now hee cannot traverſe it.
<hi>C. 10. part</hi> 77. The generall Count in an Action upon the Caſe, <hi>Quod
cum indebitatus fuit</hi> in ſuch a ſumme, <hi>Super ſe Aſſumpſit,</hi> without ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Cauſe of the Debt is inſufficient. 5 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 1. Treſpaſs was
brought for taking of a Chain of Gold; The Defendant ſaid, That the
Plaintiff before the treſpaſs ſuppoſed did Licenſe him to take the ſame
Chain, and to retain it untill he paid him 200 Marks, which he ought to
pay him. <hi>Keble</hi> took Exception, becauſe the Defendant did not alledge
for what cauſe the 200 Marks was due, which Cauſe the Plaintiff might
traverſe: to which <hi>Brian acc'. 9 E.</hi> 4. 41. Treſpaſs for taking a Bagg with
Money; the Defendant ſaid, That the Plaintiff was indebted unto him
in a certain Summ, and delivered unto him the Bagg of Money in ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.
<hi>Littleton,</hi> The plea is not good, for he ought to ſhew how he
was indebted unto him. <hi>Old Entries</hi> 155, 156. there in a Forraign At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment
the certainty of the Debt was expreſſed and averred. 2. He
pleads a Cuſtom, and doth not proſecute his Caſe according to Cuſtom.
The Cuſtom is, That if the Sergeant retorn, that he hath nothing within
the City whereby he may be ſummoned; And <hi>Non eſt inventus.</hi> And
at the next Court day he be ſolemnly demanded, and make default, &amp;c.
And he ſaith, That becauſe he had nothing by which he could bee ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned;
but doth not ſay, That the Officer did return that he had not
any thing whereby to be ſummoned, nor that he was not to be found,
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:40982:201"/>
nor doth he plead or ſay, That at the next Court day he was ſolemnly
demanded. <hi>Dyer. 196. b.</hi> where this Caſe of Forraign Attachment was;
there the Cuſtom is ſet forth, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Debt ought to be affirmed
by the Oath of the party in <hi>Curia</hi> Guildhall; and this was pleaded to be
in <hi>Curia Vicecomit in Computatorio.</hi> Alſo he doth not averr, That he
had found pledges according to the Cuſtom, and therefore the plea is
inſufficient, becauſe he hath not purchaſed the Cuſtom. 3. He ſheweth
that the goods were attached in the Defendants hands, but he doth not
ſhew that it was within the Liberty of the City and it might be out of
the liberty of the City, and all the Preſidents are <hi>infra Juriſdictionem &amp;c.</hi>
And the Plea of every perſon ſhall be taken ſtrongeſt againſt the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
And he ought to have ſhewed that it was within the Liberty of the
City, becauſe it is a peculiar Juriſdiction. 34 <hi>E. 3. breve</hi> 789. Debt was
brought in the Common Pleas; the Defendant ſaid, That the Plaintiff
had a Bill for the ſame Debt depending in the Exchequer; and demanded
Judgment of the Writ, <hi>&amp; non allocatur:</hi> for it doth not appear by the Plea
that the Plaintiff or Defendant were priviledged in the Exchequer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and

no Common plea ſhall be holden in the Exchequer. 4 <hi>E. 4 36. a,</hi> In
treſpaſs for Impriſonment, the Defendant doth juſtifie, &amp;c. there he
ought to ſhew that the Tower of <hi>London</hi> hath priviledges &amp;c. For where
a man will take advantage of a particular Priviledge and Liberty, he
ought to ſhew that he was within the Priviledge of Liberty. <hi>Mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 2. Car-Willis</hi>
was Indicted before the Juſtices of <hi>Northampton</hi> for frequenting
of a Bawdy-houſe in <hi>Northampton;</hi> and the Indictment was quaſhed,
for it might be within <hi>Northampton,</hi> and yet out of the Liberties and
Juriſdiction of <hi>Northampton.</hi> 4. He doth not ſhew in his Plea that his
Debt was a due Debt: and it was pleaded <hi>Dyer</hi> 196. that it was a
due Debt, <hi>vi Entries</hi> 155, 156. It is not enough to ſwear his Debt, but
he muſt ſweat his Debt to be a due Debt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Stone</hi> for the Defendant. 1. I agree, that if the Action had been
brought in that Court to recover a Debt, then he ought to ſet forth
how it became due: but here he pleads to bar him, and not to recover,
and ſo the Debt is not traverſable. 5 <hi>H.</hi> 7 1. there <hi>Brian</hi> took the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception;
but two Judges are againſt him, becauſe he brought not Debt,
but another Action for the Chain. 9 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 41. It is good by <hi>Moile,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſhewing the Debt, becauſe it is by way of excuſe. 39 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 9. is
ruled in the point: there the Attachment is in his own hands; there
the other pleaded there was no debt: It is there ruled, that the debt is
not traverſable; for if there be no debt, then he ſhall have reſtitution
in <hi>London</hi> upon the pledges. It was objected, That he is to ſwear his
debt to be a true debt. I anſwer, It ought to be ſo intended: and
then if he lay a Cuſtom to ſwear the Debt, and we ſay we have ſworn
our Debt, then we have purſued the Cuſtom. 3. It was objected, that it
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:40982:201"/>
is not ſhewed where the goods were, whether within the juriſdiction of
the City. 4 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 36. there the place came not in queſtion: But in our
Caſe we lay, That the Cuſtom is, that the goods muſt be in <hi>London.
Old Entries,</hi> 155, 156. there it is not alleadged that the goods were
within the City of <hi>London</hi> at the time of the Attachment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If a Precept
be awarded to the Officer, who retorns that he hath not any thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the City; and upon the allegation of the Plaintiff that ſuch a one
hath goods of the Defendant in his hands, was the Objection. I anſwer,
If we have not proceeded well, yet the Proceſs is well enough; for
here is a Judgment againſt him in <hi>London:</hi> then ſo long as the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is in force againſt him, he cannot have the goods: 21 <hi>E. 4 23. b.</hi>
It is a Rule, That a ſtranger unto a plaint ſhall not be received to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge
diſcontinuance in the proceſs: So the Sheriff ſhall not excuſe
himſelf upon an Eſcape, that there was Error in the Judgment nor a
privy ſhall not take advantage of it. <hi>Ognels</hi> Caſe <hi>Trim. 31 Eliz.</hi> there
lies no proceſs of <hi>Capias</hi> by the Law upon a Recogniſance, but Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
or <hi>Levari facias:</hi> Yet there a <hi>Capias</hi> was awarded; and if the
party taken eſcape, the Sheriff ſhall not take advantage of the Erronious
proceſs. So I deſire Judgment for the Defendant. And he took an
Exception to the Declaration: In Detinue, if the Declaration be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
it is good, <hi>(ſc.) Licet ſepius requiſitu, &amp;c.</hi> But here he ſhews
that he delivered the Cloak to be redelivered upon Requeſt, and he
doth not ſhew any particular Requeſt, but ſayes generally <hi>Licet ſepius</hi>
requiſitus. <hi>Ward,</hi> There is a difference betwixt Detinue, and Action
upon the Caſe: For in an Action upon the Caſe he ought to ſhew a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Requeſt. 26 <hi>H.</hi> 6. If I bail goods to redeliver upon requeſt,
yet I may ſeiſe them without requeſt. <hi>Dodderidge</hi> Juſtice, The reſeiſure
of the goods is a Requeſt in Law, a Requeſt with a witneſs, a Requeſt
with effect; and untill Requeſt, he hath juſt cauſe to keep them. <hi>Jones</hi>
Juſtice, In Debt and Detinue the very bringing of the Action and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the Writ is a demand and requeſt: And if he appear at the firſt
Summons, then he excuſes himſelf, otherwiſe he ſhall be ſubject to da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages:
but the Requeſt ought not to be ſo preciſely alleadged. But
if a collateral thing be to be done upon Requeſt, there to ſay <hi>ſepius re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitus,</hi>
is not ſufficient. So if I ſell a horſe for 10<hi rend="sup">•</hi>. to be paid upon
Requeſt, there the Requeſt muſt be preciſely laid, for it is parcel of the
Contract: And in Action upon the Caſe, and upon Debt, you muſt lay
a Requeſt, <hi>Dodderidge</hi> Juſtice, The Requeſt is no part of the Debt:
for the Debt is preſently due; but if I make the Requeſt to be part of
the Contract, there it is otherwiſe: As if I deliver goods to redeliver to
me, there needeth no preciſe Requeſt: but if it be to redeliver upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
there the Requeſt ought to be alleadged, for there the Requeſt is
part of the Contract. The Caſe was adjourned till the next Term.</p>

might be a cauſe of great contention amongſt the Inhabitants of <hi>Tue.</hi>
The Plaintiffe denyed the oppreſſion alledged againſt him; and the
Defendant did juſtifie, and ſaid that <hi>I. S.</hi> being ſeiſed of the Mannor of
<hi>Tue,</hi> did demiſe certain Lands, parcel thereof unto <hi>I. F.</hi> for eighty years;
who made a Leaſe of the ſame at Will; and afterwards <hi>I. S.</hi> did Enfeoff
<hi>Tanfield</hi> the Plaintiff of the ſaid Mannor, to whom the Tenants did at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torn
Tenants: And the Defendant ſhewed, That time out of mind,
the Inhabitants of the Town of <hi>Tue</hi> had Common in the Waſte of the
ſaid Mannor, and that a great part of the ſaid Mannor was incloſed,
and the Meerſtones removed (but doth not ſhew by whom:) And
ſhewed that the Lands incloſed, out of which the Inhabitants had
their Common. And ſaid, That there were divers other Grievances
to the Inhabitants of <hi>Tue,</hi> (but did not ſhew by whom they were,
nor what they were) and ſhewed, that at a Parliament the Defendant
did deliver ſuch a Writing to the Prince, as one of the Peers of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ſuppoſing that the grievances were ſet upon the Inhabitants by the
Plaintiff, by reaſon the Plaintiff occupied the Lands ſo incloſed; and for
Reformation thereof, that he delivered the Writing to the Prince <hi>Abſque
hoc,</hi> that he did deliver it in any other manner. And upon this Plea in
Barr, <hi>Tanfield</hi> the Plaintiff did demurr in Law.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Noy</hi> for the Plaintiff ſaid, That the Defendant complains of wrong,
and doth not ſhew any wrong to be done by <hi>Tanfield</hi> the Plaintiff; It is
a grievous ſcandal to deliver this Writing; for it is a ſcandalous Writing,
and no Petition: for therein he doth not deſire any Reformation, but
complains generally. Betwixt <hi>John Friſel</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Norwich,</hi>
The Caſe touched in 21 <hi>E.</hi> 3. was, That <hi>Friſel</hi> brought a Prohibition to

The Biſhop, and the Biſhop excommunicated him for the delivering of
it unto him; The Biſhop was fined: And there it is ſaid, As Reverence
is due to the King, ſo it is due to his Miniſters. Our Action is brought
at the Common Law, and not upon the Statute of <hi>R. 2. de ſcandalis
magnatum. M. 18 E. 3. Rot. 162. Thomas Badbrook</hi> ſent a Letter to
<hi>Ferris,</hi> one of the Kings Councel, the effect of which was, That <hi>Scot</hi>
Chief Juſtice of the Kings Bench, and his Companions of the ſame
Bench, would not do a vain thing at the Command of the King; yet
becauſe he ſent ſuch a Letter to the Kings Councel, although he ſpake
no ill, yet becauſe it might incenſe the King againſt the Judges, he was
puniſhed, for it might be a means to make the King againſt his Judges.
We are to ſee here, if the Defendant hath made any good Juſtification;
If there were no wrong, then there was no cauſe to complain. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
If he had demeaned himſelf as he ought, he ought to have had the
wrong (if there were any) reformed, and that he did not do. 11 <hi>H. 4. 5 H.</hi> 7.
A voice of Fame is a good cauſe for to Arreſt a man of Felony; but
then ſome Felony ought to be committed. 7 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 35. A certain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
came and ſaid to one, that there were certain Oxen ſtoln, and that
he did ſuſpect ſuch a one who he arreſted upon the ſuſpition: It is a
good cauſe of Juſtification if any Oxen were ſtoln; but if no Fellony
was committed, if one be arreſted upon ſuſpicion that he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
Fellony, it is not good: If Fellony be done, then a good cauſe
to ſuſpect him; but if no Fellony be done, nor he knoweth nor heareth
of any Fellony committed, there is no cauſe for to ſuſpect that the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
hath committed Fellony; but there ought to be ſuſpition that the
partie hath committed ſuch a particular Fellony: Where Fellony is
committed certainly, one may be arreſted upon ſuſpition, but unleſs a
Fellony be committed he cannot be arreſted: For where no Fellony is
committed at all, he ſhall not be drawn to a Tryal to clear himſelf of
the ſuſpition; but if a Fellony be certainly committed, and he be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted
upon the ſuſpition, there he being forced to anſwer to the Fello<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
he may clear and purge himſelf of the infamy upon his tryal, and ſo
the infamy is not permanent, as in caſe when no Fellony is committed;
for there he may bring his Action upon the Caſe. Here he ſaith that
parcel of the Waſte is incloſed, and doth not ſhew what parcel, ſo as no
certain iſſue can be taken upon it. <hi>Moor</hi> and <hi>Hawkins</hi> Caſe in an <hi>Ejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one
firme,</hi> It was alledged that he entred into parcel of the Land, and
the Land was alledged to lie in two ſeveral Towns; and it was not good,
becauſe no certain iſſue could be thereupon: He ſaith the ſame was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed,
but doth not ſhew by whom it was incloſed, <hi>viz.</hi> whether by
the Feoffor, or <hi>Tanfield</hi> the Feoffee: he complains of many grievances,
but doth not ſhew what they are, and he ought not to be his own
Judge.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="407" facs="tcp:40982:203"/>
Secondly, He hath not demeaned himſelf as he ought; for he hath not
deſired in the Letter any Reformation, but only he complains of the
oppreſſion of <hi>Tanfield:</hi> He ought to have directed the Writing unto
the Parliament, and he directed the ſame unto the Prince by name; In
the Letter he doth not ſhew that <hi>Tanfield</hi> the Plaintiff did oppreſs, but
that the Plaintiff was an oppreſſor, but he doth not ſhew in what thing.

            <p>THe Caſe was between <hi>Sommers</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> his Wife Plaintiffs;
who Traverſed an Office found after the death of one <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berts:</hi>
The parties were at Iſſue upon one point in the Traverſe;
and it was found againſt the King. <hi>Henden</hi> Serjeant moved:
The Office finds, That <hi>Roberts</hi> dyed ſeiſed of two Acres in Soc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cage,
and four foot of Lands holden <hi>in Capite:</hi> (which was alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<hi>Roberts</hi> had by Encroachment.) <hi>Sommers</hi> and his Wife plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
That <hi>Roberts</hi> in his life time did enfeoffe them of one of
the Acres, <hi>Abſque hoc</hi> that that Acre did diſcend. And for
the other Acre they pleaded and entitled themſelves by the Will
of <hi>Roberts, Abſque hoc,</hi> that <hi>Roberts</hi> was ſeiſed thereof. That I
take to be an inſufficient Traverſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, it is found by the Office, That <hi>Roberts</hi> dyed ſeiſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
that the ſame diſcended to four Daughters, and One of the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
is the Wife of <hi>Sommers:</hi> And hee and his Wife traverſe the
Office, and confeſſe that the Anceſtor died ſeiſed, <hi>Abſque hoc</hi> that
the ſame diſcended. The Traverſe is repugnant in it ſelf, for if he
did Deviſe it, then untill Entry by the Deviſee it doth diſcend<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but if they had pleaded the Deviſe only, and Entry by force thereof,
it might have been a good Traverſe. The Office findes that it did
diſcend to four Daughters, and the Wife of <hi>Sommers</hi> is one of the
four Daughters, and he and his Wife Traverſe the diſcent, and
that is not good, for one cannot Traverſe that which makes a
Title to himſelf. 37 <hi>Aſſ.</hi> 1. The Rule there put is; That a Man
cannot Traverſe the Office by which he is intitled; but in point of
Tenure he may Traverſe it: wherewith agrees <hi>Stamford Prerogat.

thereby it appeared that Two there had occaſion to Traverſe it, and
it was holden that, they all ought to joyne in the Traverſe.
<hi>Finch</hi> Recorder of <hi>London, contr'.</hi> The Office found generally,
That <hi>Roberts</hi> had four Daughters, and had two Acres and four
Foot of Lands, and that the ſame diſcended to four Daughters:
<hi>Sommers</hi> and his Wife Traverſe the Office, and plead, That as to
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:40982:205"/>
one Acre; <hi>Roberts</hi> made a Feoffment thereof unto them, <hi>Abſque hoc</hi>
that he died ſeiſed thereof. 2. That <hi>Roberts</hi> deviſed the other
Acre to them <hi>Abſque hoc</hi> that the ſame did diſcend. 5 <hi>Eliz. Dyer 221:
Biſhops</hi> Caſe, There it is reſolved, That a Deviſe doth prevent a

<hi>49 E.</hi> 3, 16. There a Deviſe did prevent an Eſcheat to the King.</p>
            <p>As to the four Foot (gained by Encroachment) which is holden
of the King <hi>in Capite,</hi> They traverſe <hi>Abſque hoc</hi> that <hi>Roberts</hi> was
ſeiſed thereof; I agree that where their Title is joynt, there all
muſt Traverſe; but in our Caſe we Traverſe for our ſelves, and
deny any thing to be due to the three other Siſters.</p>
            <p>The four Foot of Waſte, was part of the Mannor of <hi>Bayhall;</hi>
and the <hi>Venire facias</hi> was out of that Mannor, and the Towns where
the other lands lay. 9 <hi>E. 4. A.</hi> diſſeiſes <hi>B.</hi> of a Mannor and <hi>A.</hi>

the Mannor as in Truth it now is: <hi>Henden</hi> contr'. It is no part
of the Mannor of <hi>Bayhall,</hi> for it is encroached out of it; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Venire facias</hi> ought not to be of the Mannor of <hi>Bayhall.</hi>
The Jury finde that he had encroached four Foot <hi>Ex vaſto Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerii,
&amp;c. Dodderige</hi> Juſtice, the encroachment doth not make it
to be no parcell of the Mannor. <hi>Ley</hi> chief Juſtice, it is not
layed to be a Diſſeiſin, but an Encroachment, and therefore it is
not ſo ſtrong as a Diſſeiſin with a Diſcent, but in Right it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to the Mannor: Tenant in Tail makes a Feoffment to the uſe
of himſelf, and deviſeth the Lands to <hi>A.</hi> the Deviſe doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent

            <p>
               <hi>Haughton</hi> Juſtice the Diſcent is Traverſed: The Father dieth

and that the Lands diſcend unto him <hi>Abſque hoc</hi> that they
diſcended to the Eldeſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dodderidge</hi> Juſtice, Regularly, you ſhall not Traverſe the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent
but by the dying ſeiſed; but in this Caſe it ought to be of

                  </gap>
               </hi> in caſe of a Deviſe, the Traverſe muſt be of the
Diſcent; for here they cannot traverſe the dying ſeiſed, for
if they traverſe the dying ſeiſed, then they overthrow their own
Title, <hi>ſc.</hi> the Deviſe; but here in Caſe of a Will, the partie ſhall
traverſe the Diſcent, for he cannot ſay that it is true that the Lands
did diſcend, and that he Deviſed it, &amp;c. The heir cannot traverſe
that which entitles him by Diſcent; but here his Title is by the
Deviſe, and not as heir. <hi>Finch</hi> Recorder, the Deviſe is not of the
four Foot, for if we confeſs the dying ſeiſed of the four Foot which
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:40982:206"/>
was holden in <hi>Capite,</hi> then we ſhould overthrow our own Deviſe.
The Office finds that he died ſeiſed of the whole, and therefore of
the four foot. He being never ſeiſed, we traverſe the dying ſeiſed
thereof, and we deny that he ever had it; ſo the Traverſe is good
without making of us any Title unto it, for we deſire not to have it.
<hi>Dodderidge</hi> Juſtice, If a man deviſeth to his heir, it is a void Deviſe;
for the diſcent ſhall be preferred: But if one hath Iſſue four daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and he deviſeth to one of them, it is good for the whole
Land ſo deviſed to her; and no part of the Land ſo deviſed ſhall
diſcend to the other, the Lands being holden in Socage. <hi>Ley</hi> Chief
Juſtice and the whole Court did agree, That they might deny and
traverſe the four Foot, if the Anceſtor had no Title unto it: and
Judgment was given accordingly againſt the King, <hi>quod nota.</hi>

The Jury was from the place where the Agreement was made,
the verdict will not make good the Declaration, although the Jury

That that was the Jury which could try his endeavour. The Caſe
of 3 <hi>E.</hi> 4. of the Servant was to ſerve him ſeaven years, and there

they found, That after that <hi>Genny</hi> did ſurrender and reſtore the
Letters Patents in the Chancery to be cancelled, and that in truth
they were cancelled, and that the ſaid Surrender was made to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent

that they were ſurrendred, and that the intent of the Surrender

They further found, That King <hi>Philip</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> 5 &amp; 6
of their Reigns, being ſeiſed of the ſaid Mannor and Park <hi>in jnro
Coronae,</hi> reciting that <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. <hi>anno</hi> 36 of his Reign had granted

that thoſe Letters-Patents were ſurrendred <hi>ea intentione</hi> to make a
new Leaſe <hi>in forma ſequente</hi> They in conſideration of good ſervice
and 200l. paid did grant the Office as before, and by thoſe Letters-Patents
did grant Herbage generally (whereas the firſt Patent was
reaſonable Herbage) And by theſe Letters-Patents did grant to him
the Mannor <hi>cum pertinaciis</hi> (except the grand trees and woods in
the Park) and Felons goods which were granted by the firſt Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
Patents for 50 years: And here was a Rent reſerved; and a
<hi>Proviſo</hi> that for doing of Waſte that the Letters-Patents ſhould be
be void: And there was no ſuch <hi>Proviſo</hi> in the firſt Letters-Patents.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>27 Eliz.</hi> Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> reciting the Letters-Patents of 5 &amp; 6
<hi>Phil. &amp; Mary verbatim</hi> and truly, did grant the Parkerſhip unto
Secretary <hi>Walſingham,</hi> and Leaſed the Mannor unto him with the
Appurtenances, with power to take 100 loads of wood, Excepting
the Deer, <hi>Habendum</hi> from the end of the Leaſe to <hi>Pawlet</hi> either
by ſurrender or forfeiture for 21 years rendring rent, and for
not payment a Re-entry. <hi>Walſingham</hi> granted the ſame to <hi>H.</hi> who
granted to the ſame to <hi>Moor</hi> and others Defendants. King <hi>James
anno</hi> 1. of his Reign granted the ſaid Mannor, and the Offices of
Stewardſhip and Parkerſhip all by one Letters-Patents to the Lord
<hi>Zouch,</hi> who thereupon entred. <hi>Moore</hi> entred upon him and cut
down the Trees; and the Lord <hi>Zouch</hi> brought the Action of
Treſpaſs.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Henry Yelverton</hi> argued for the Plaintiff, and ſaid, 1. The
Leaſe made unto <hi>Pawlet 36 H.</hi> 8. is a void Leaſe in Law. 2. The
ſecond Leaſe unto <hi>Pawlet</hi> made by King <hi>Philip</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary
5</hi> &amp; 6. is alſo void in Law. 3. The Leaſe made by Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>
to <hi>Walſingham, anno</hi> 27 of her Reign, is alſo void in Law. And
that the Leaſe made by King <hi>James</hi> is good in Law; and the Action
of Treſpaſs brought by him will well lie. The firſt Leaſe is void;
For it is granted upon a falſe ſuggeſtion made by <hi>Genny, ſcil.</hi> a
ſuppoſed Surrender: For the Leaſe which he did ſurrender did not
bear date 32. but 33 <hi>H.</hi> 8. and the Surrender to the King was falſe;
for the Leaſe ſuppoſed to be ſurrendred by <hi>Genny</hi> beareth date <hi>32
H.</hi> 8. whereas there was no ſuch Leaſe made to <hi>Genny:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
both being the ſuggeſtions of the party, the King was deceived;
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:40982:207"/>
For what Leaſe <hi>Genny</hi> had, the King could not know but by the
ſuggeſtion of <hi>Genny;</hi> and upon his information the King was
contented to accept of a Surrender, which was but a ſhew of a
Surrender. The King could not know with what <hi>Genny</hi> treated
him, but by his Information; and in both the King was deceived:
For it was not the Kings intent to charge the lands but with one
Leaſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>C. 6. part,</hi> The Lord <hi>Shandoe's</hi> Caſe; The reaſon of the
Judgment there proves our Caſe: For there all which grew by the
Information of the party was true, and then the King made a wrong
Collection thereupon; but that which he collected was not upon
the Information of the party. And there it was agreed, That if in
any part the party had miſ-informed the King, that the whole had
been void. <hi>Dyer 35<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

unto the Queen his Leaſe for 80 years, <hi>ea intentione</hi> that
the Queen ſhall make unto him a new Leaſe for 20 years. The
Queen reciting that the ſaid Leſſee did ſurrender a Leaſe for 80
years, did grant to him a Leaſe for 20 years: The Leaſe for 20
years was adjudged void; For he did ſurrender no Leaſe unto
the Queen. And there <hi>Dyer</hi> ſaid, That it is all one where the
Conſideration is falſe, and where the Information is falſe; there,
and here is but a ſhew of a ſurrender, And it was not the Queens
intent to paſs more then ſhe took by the Surrender. <hi>Henry</hi> the 8.
recites, That <hi>Genny</hi> hath ſurrendred up the Patent which bore
date 32 <hi>H</hi> 8. And there was not any ſuch Patent. <hi>Genny</hi> ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted
that he had given up the Patent, dated 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. when
he had not any ſuch Patent. So the King was deceived in the ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion.</p>
            <p>A difference hath been taken betwixt Conſideration and Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation:
Here the Conſideration was Service, and Two hundred
pounds paid; And it was objected, That he took here by the
Conſideration, and not by force of the Information. But I ſay
that the Information was the ground upon which the Patent was
made. For it was not the Kings intent to charge the lands with
two leaſes, <hi>C. 2. part</hi> 17. there it is cited, That in a Patent of
King <hi>Henry</hi> the 7. four Letters, <hi>viz. H R. F. H.</hi> of the firſt words
were left out, intending afterwards <hi>propter honorem</hi> to be ſet out
with gold: but the great Seal was put to the Patent, leaving out
the ſaid four letters; and yet the Patent was adjudged good being
referred to the Inrollment, Privy-ſeal &amp;c. For thereby it appeareth
that it was the grant of the King.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="416" facs="tcp:40982:208"/>
If Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> recite, That whereas her Father made ſuch
a Leaſe, and doth not recite it by the name of <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. her
Father, it is good enough, if <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. made ſuch a Leaſe:
But in ſuch caſe, if <hi>Henry</hi> the 7. made the Leaſe, then the Leaſe of
the Queen had not been good, for that ſhe miſtook her Anceſtor,
for <hi>Henry</hi> the 7. was her Grandfather. 10 <hi>H. 7. 20. 20 H. 7.
7,</hi> 8. The Kings Patent may be without Date; for he may reſort
to the Inrolment and Privy-Seal, and ſo help it: But in ſuch
caſe if he doth ſurmiſe a falſe Date, the ſame makes the Patent
void. 21 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 45. Miſrecital of the year of the Reign of the King
will make void a Patent: And in our Caſe, by the miſrecital
of the year of the King there is a year gained.</p>
            <p>It was objected, That it ſhall be helped by the Statute of
<hi>34 H.</hi> 8. which helps Miſ-recital, and Non-recital: But in our
caſe it is not a Miſ-recital: For Miſ-recital is when part of that
which is recited is true, and part falſe; but Non-recital is, when
nothing at all is recited. But in our Caſe, it is a falſe Recital of
the ſubject in the thing which is ſurrendred; <hi>Genny</hi> ſurrendred
nothing, and the King took nothing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <hi>Trin. 9 Jacobi, Roper</hi> and <hi>Roden's</hi> Caſes. <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. reciting
by his Grant, That where he had a Reverſion expectant upon a
Demiſe made unto <hi>M.</hi> whereas in truth it was made unto <hi>N:</hi>
He granted the Reverſion unto <hi>Roden.</hi> It was adjudged, That
that recital was not helped by the Statute of 34 <hi>H.</hi> 8. for that
the King had not any ſuch Reverſion. 19 <hi>Jacobi, Tucker</hi> and
<hi>Carr's</hi> Caſe was adjudged upon the ſame point, <hi>Doddington's</hi>
Caſe, <hi>C. 2. part,</hi> There a general Grant is not helped by the
Statute of 34 <hi>H.</hi> 8. In our Caſe here is a miſtaking of the thing
it ſelf: If he had recited the ſame to be 33 <hi>H.</hi> 8. and then
had miſtaken any thing in it, it had been helped by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of 34 <hi>H.</hi> 8.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dyer 195. Kemp</hi> was Nonſuit, (there 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. was miſtaken
for 33 <hi>H. 8.)</hi> There the Surrender was of a Patent bearing date
<hi>32 H.</hi> 8. whereas in truth it bore date 33 <hi>H.</hi> 8. And there it is
adjudged, That the Patent of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. cannot be the Patent of
33 H. 8. by which the Office was granted to him: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was adjudged void, notwithſtanding the Act of 34 H. 8.
and other Statutes of Miſrecital. So in our Caſe 33 <hi>H.</hi> 8. is miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken,
and it is 32. whereas in truth it was 33 H. 8.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="417" facs="tcp:40982:208"/>
The ſecond Point then is, If the Leaſe of 36. H. 8. be
void, then of neceſſity the Leaſe of 5. &amp; 6. <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
is void, for therein is falſity of three things. 1. The
thing recited is the cuſtody of the Park, with reaſonable
Herbage and the Patentee would have nothing but <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſa,</hi>
and he truſts the King to give that; and he takes
from the Queen Herbage (leaving out reaſonable) and ſo
hee takes more then was intended him, and therefore hee
hath deceived the Queen; and if you are to have reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Herbage; the King may put one to be Overſeer,
that you have that which is fitting and reaſonable, and
the Queen may agiſter Cattel there; but in our Caſe the
Queen can neither ſet any Overſeer, nor can ſhe agiſt
Cattel there. <hi>Dyer 285. 2. H. 8. Killaway</hi> 159. He who
hath reaſonable Herbage cannot incloſe, but hee which
hath Herbage may incloſe. Then foraſmuch as here the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
is larger then it was before, <hi>ſcil.</hi> that which was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred,
the Patent is void; for the Queen Grants more
then ſhe took by the ſurrender: For hee did ſurrender <hi>eâ
intentione,</hi> that the Queen ſhould regrant him <hi>praemiſſa;</hi>
and by this new Grant he hath more. 2. He recites,
That hee had a Leaſe for fifty years abſolutely, whereas it
was determinable upon death; and the Queen grants the
ſame for fifty years abſolutely, and that was by reaſon of his
falſe Suggeſtion. It may be objected, That the Queen is not
deceived, for the limitation for life is not annexed to the
<hi>Habendum. 20. Eliz.</hi> in the Kings Bench, <hi>Hunts</hi> Caſe; The
Queen made a Leaſe to begin at a day to come, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
the Queen by the ſuggeſtion of the party, and for
the ſurrender of the preſent Leaſe, did make a new Leaſe
unto the party; it was adjudged, That the new Leaſe was
void. So here, the Queen was deceived in the quality of
the Leaſe. 9. <hi>E. 4. 12. Baggots</hi> Caſe; The King reciting
that <hi>Baggot</hi> was born in <hi>Normandy</hi> (whereas in truth he was
born in <hi>France)</hi> made him a Denizen; and the Patent,
notwithſtanding this falſe recital of the party, was adjudged
good, for the intent was to make him a Denizen: That
Caſe was objected againſt me. But put the Caſe a little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and it is otherwiſe; for if at that time <hi>Edward</hi> the
fourth had had Wars with <hi>France,</hi> then the Patent had been
void, for it was not the Kings intent to protect a man who
was an Enemy, and to nouriſh him in his own boſom. If
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:40982:209"/>
the Queen had made the new Leaſe to begin after the firſt fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
years, then it had been void. <hi>C. 1. part</hi> the Rector of <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dington's</hi>
Caſe; It is not the years, but the death of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentee
which determins the Leaſe. <hi>C. 2. part</hi> 72. In a Deed there
is not any proper place where the Proviſo ſhall be inſerted,
then if it come in any place, ſo as it doth not lean upon a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
it is a good condition. 35. <hi>Eliz.</hi> betwixt <hi>Throgmorton</hi>
and Sir <hi>Moile Finch.</hi> Queen <hi>Mary</hi> made a Leaſe unto <hi>Throg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morton</hi>
for 21 years, and in the end of the Leaſe there is a
Proviſo, That the Leaſe ſhall ceaſe if the Rent be behind.
<hi>Popham</hi> Chief Juſtice ſaid, That <hi>Throgmorton</hi> hath ſuch a
Leaſe which is abſolute, but ſhortned by limitation in the end
of the Leaſe; and he might plead it generally and abſolutely,
That thoſe who will take advantage of the Proviſo, ought
to ſhew where the Proviſo comes in another clauſe. So
here <hi>Pawlet</hi> ſhould have informed the Queen of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſo,
for hee truſts the Queen, and the Queen truſts him.
The third Falſity is, It is pretended, That the Park of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diham</hi>
doth paſſe with the Manor; for the Manor is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by King <hi>Philip</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary, cum pertinentiis;</hi> and it
is found by the Jury that the Park is parcel of the Manor. He
hath deceived and miſ-informed the Queen; for in the Leaſe
which he ſurrendred, the Park is excepted, and now he would
ſteal it in by the general words, <hi>cum pertinentiis.</hi> If the Park
doth not paſſe, then the Defendants are Treſpaſſors to the
Plaintiffe; and if the Manor doth not paſſe, then they are
Treſpaſſors; ſo as they are in a <hi>Dilemma.</hi> This Park (admit
the Manor paſſeth) doth not paſſe: for Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> ſhortly
after, made <hi>Pawlet</hi> a Marqueſs, and then ſhe granted unto
him by Letters Patents. The cuſtody of the Park, and the
Intereſt of the Park cannot ſtand together in one perſon;
and he cannot be the Queens Parker, when as it is his own
Park. <hi>C. 8 part</hi> 117. The beſt Expoſitor of Letters Patents, are
the Letters Patents themſelves, joyning one part of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
Patents with the other. And here in one clauſe the cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
of the Park is granted by expreſs name; and the general
words, viz. Grant of the Manor <hi>cum pertinentiis</hi> doth not
convey it. There is a difference betwixt the Cuſtody of a
Park, and the Intereſt of the Park. In <hi>Com.</hi> 399. If a Parker
be attainted and pardoned, hee loſeth not his Park, but hee
may be a Parker notwithſtanding ſuch Attainder; but if the
Owner of a Park be attainted and pardoned, he loſeth his
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:40982:209"/>
Park; a Parker is a matter of ſervice, and cannot be forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
but an Intereſt may. 10. <hi>H.</hi> 7. 6. The Keeper ſhall
render account for the Hawks, for it is parcel of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
of the Park; but Leſſee for years of a Park ſhall not
render account for them: So there is a difference betwixt
the Intereſt in a Park, and a Parkerſhip. 12. <hi>H.</hi> 8. 1. Leſſee
for years of a Park ſuffereth the Pale to fall down or
decay, Waſte lieth; but if a Parker ſuffereth the Pale to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay,
he can onely loſe his Office. <hi>Dyer</hi> 71. The Owner
of a Park may diſpark it, but he who hath only the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bage
of it, cannot. A man hath the cuſtody of a houſe,
and afterwards he becomes the Owner of the houſe; his cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtodie
therein ceaſeth. There are four Miſchiefs in our
Caſe: 1. By expreſſing himſelfe to be Parker, hee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
himſelfe from being Owner. 2. The Keeper is Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable,
but Leſſee for years is not. 3. If he be only
Keeper of it, then the Queen might diſpark: but if he
were Leſſee, the Queen could not. 4. Where he is Keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
all will reſt upon account, as well the Deer which
hee findes there when hee became Keeper, as thoſe
which came after. But that makes the Queen in doubt,
whether the Exception ſhould extend to the Deer; then
whether to thoſe Deer which came after:</p>
            <p>The third Point was concerning WALSINGHAM'S
Leaſe; It is of the Manor, and <hi>Cuſtodiam Parci.</hi> Firſt,
This Leaſe hath one of the wounds of the former Leaſes:
for the Parkerſhip is granted expreſly. Secondly, The leaſes
before being void, then this Leaſe muſt needs be void alſo.
Thirdly, This Leaſe is to take effect upon the end, Surrender,
or Forfeiture of the Leaſe to <hi>Pawlet,</hi> which was made 5. &amp; 6.
<hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> and that leaſe had not any beginning,
and therefore was void; and ſo the three limitations, End,
Surrender or Forfeiture cannot happen. <hi>Dyer</hi> 197, 198.
From the death of the Father the leaſe which is made to the
Son ſhall begin the Father being dead, it is a void leaſe to
the Son. <hi>C. 6 part</hi> 35. Enumeration of particular times, if
it do not happen within the particular, then it ſhall never
begin: And ſo it is of this leaſe to <hi>Walſingham</hi> in our Caſe.
Note, it was ſaid by Sir <hi>Henry Yelvertor,</hi> That it was the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of the Judges in this Caſe, That he had but the cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of the Park, and not the intereſt of the Park; for by the
acceptance of the cuſtody of a Park, when he hath a leaſe of
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:40982:210"/>
the Park it ſelfe before, it is a ſurrender of his leaſe. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venport</hi>
argued for the Defendant <hi>More.</hi> The queſtion which
is made of the leaſe of 27. <hi>Eliz. reſts upon the leaſe made to
Genny 33. H.</hi> 8. which was determined upon the ſurrender of
the leſſee. 2. It reſts upon the leaſe made to <hi>Pawlet. 36. H.</hi> 8.
which was for fifty years, determinable by two Proviſoes;
the one for not payment of a ſum in groſs. 3. It reſts upon
the leaſe made to <hi>Pawlet.</hi> 5 &amp; 6. <hi>Ph. &amp; M.</hi> for 50 years from
Mich<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> laſt paſt, upon the death of <hi>Pawlet,</hi> or committing of
Waſte. The leaſe of 27. <hi>Eliz.</hi> is a leaſe in reverſion for 31
years, to begin after the ſurrender, forfeiture or expiration of
the leaſe made 4 &amp; 5 <hi>Ph. &amp; M.</hi> to <hi>Pawlet.</hi> Exception is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to the leaſe 36. <hi>H</hi> 8. becauſe it hath two falſities; the firſt,
Becauſe it miſ-recites the leaſe of 33 <hi>H.</hi> 8. reciting the ſame to
be dated 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. whereas in truth it was dated 33 <hi>H.</hi> 8. and
that varies the term of years, and that leaſe is not good at the
common law, nor as they objected, is it helped by the Statute
of 34. <hi>H.</hi> 8. of Miſ-recitalls. Secondly, Becauſe it is upon
a falſe ſuggeſſtion of the Patentee, and therefore it is void.
It was alſo obejected, That the leaſe of 5 &amp; 6 <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
was void for two cauſes; firſt, Becauſe that that recites
the leaſe of 36. <hi>H.</hi> 8. to bee for fifty years, without the
Proviſo of determination by the death of <hi>Pawlet.</hi> 2. The
King is deceived in his Grant; for they objected, That it
was recited to be ſurrendred <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>intentione</hi> to regrant <hi>ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem
praemiſſa;</hi> and there are other things granted which were
not ſurrendred; They ſay, That the Leaſe is ſaid to be of the
Parkerſhip, and not of the Park; for that doth not paſſe
by the generall words <hi>cum pertinentiis;</hi> for by expreſſe
words the Parkerſhip is granted, and then not the Park
it ſelfe. The Leaſe of 33. <hi>H.</hi> 8. was truly ſurrendred; But
the King reciting that the Patent bearing date 32. <hi>H.</hi> 8. was
ſurrendred in conſideration of ſervice, did grant the office
of Parkerſhip, &amp;c. And <hi>inſuper</hi> the Manor for fifty years,
&amp;c. The queſtion is, If this miſrecitall be helped by the
Common Law: if it be not, then if the Statute of 34. <hi>H.</hi> 8.
doth help it? The Leaſe which was miſ-recited was not in
<hi>eſſe;</hi> and there is a difference when the Leaſe which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited,
is not in <hi>eſſe,</hi> but determined; and when former Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
are recited, as Leaſes in <hi>eſſe.</hi> There are three things in
which miſrecitall is materiall, and doth vitiate the Patent,
1. Miſrecitall of the Tenant to whom the Leaſe was made
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:40982:210"/>
or of the Tenant which was laſt poſſeſſed 2. Miſrecitall of the
thing demiſed. 3. Of the Eſtate in <hi>eſſe,</hi> and the Limitation. If
in ſuch caſe of miſrecitall, there be not a <hi>Non obſtante,</hi> then the
Patent is void at the Common Law, <hi>C.</hi> 4. part 35. The King by
the Law ought to be truely informed of eſtates in <hi>eſſe,</hi> and alſo
of his Rents and Revenue; But by the Common Law, if the
former Leaſes be recited to be determined, (and in truth, they
are,) and the new grant is upon another conſideration, then it
is not materiall, if they be miſrecited; for that it is not any part
of the conſideration. <hi>Vide 38. H. 6. 37. Darby.</hi> If the miſrecitall
be in any thing not materiall, which need not to be recited:
and no part of the conſideration of the new Leaſe, then it ſhall not
make void the Patent; for that the miſrecitall was not of any
thing materiall. If the miſrecitall be of a thing determined, and
the ſecond Patent depend thereupon, then the ſecond Patent is
void; for if the King recite a Leaſe made to <hi>I. S.</hi> which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined,

expreſſe words, the ſame extends to all Leaſes, with, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

be of Leaſes, which are not the guide of the ſecond Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
and need not to be recited, ſuch miſrecitall is helped
by the Statute. But if the former Patent begetteth the later,
then the Statute doth not extend unto it, for then the laſt is void,

any ſurrender, for in truth it was not ſurrendred to the Maſter of the

there is an expreſſe clauſe, that it extend not to the grant of an
Office, (as in the Caſe of <hi>Dier</hi> it was) and then it was left at the
Common Law, and the Queen was deceived, becauſe the ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

the Statute of 34. <hi>H.</hi> 8. A thing granted generally with reference

when the thing granted is particularized with reference to a thing
which is determined in a miſrecited Patent, then the Statute of
<hi>34. H.</hi> 8. will help it; but in our Caſe, the miſrecitall is of a thing
which needed not to be recited. The ſecond Objection which
hath been made, is, That the King is deceived, by reaſon of
the falſe ſuggeſtion: And then the Letters Patents made by
reaſon thereof are void. I anſwer, That if the falſe Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion
tendeth to the detriment of the Crowne, and to the

may bee avoided: But where the Suggeſtion is of a thing

the Crowne, or to the Kings prejudice, neither in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
nor his Inheritance, there it ſhall not make void the

ſixty years of the Queen, made a Leaſe for eighty yeares; the
ſixty years expired, the Leſſee for eighty years ſurrendred to
the Crown, and in conſideration of that Surrender, to have
a new Leaſe; there the ſecond Patent was void, for the King

If the King grant a Manor, <hi>quod quidem Manerium nuper

and not of a thing that is. For if it had not been in the poſſeſſion
of I. S. whereas in truth he was not ſeiſed or poſſeſſed thereof,
there it had not been good. It is found in our Caſe, That the Leaſe is

in groſſe, that it ſhould be void; And that it ſhould determine
by the Death of <hi>Pawlet</hi> the Patentee. The miſrecitall of that

the Grant. There are three things neceſſary in Recitalls: Firſt,
The Certainty of the particular eſtate in <hi>eſſe,</hi> with the Limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Secondly, The Tenant to whome the particular eſtate
was made, or the Tenant which then is in poſſeſſion. Thirdly,
The thing granted, by the ſame name as it is granted in the
firſt Patent. But Covenants, Reſervations, Proviſions, Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

King. And afterwards he granted unto another a Leet in the ſame
Towne; the King in this caſe needed not to recite the grant of

ſame name as it was granted in the firſt Patent. And cannot be
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:40982:212"/>
helped by averment, if it be miſrecited. Thirdly, the Tenant of the

as ought to be pleaded againſt the King in an Information of

and not materiall, and not to be the guide of the ſecond
Patent, doth not make void the Grant to <hi>Pawlet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was objected, That Queen <hi>MARY</hi> was deceived: for
the Grant was <hi>de <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Park was excepted; but ſo it was not in the Letters Patents
to <hi>Pawlet:</hi> In the firſt Patent reaſonable Herbage was granted;
but in the ſecond to <hi>Pawlet,</hi> the Grant was of Herbage generally.
If the King except the Deer, as hee doth in this caſe, then hee
ought to have ſufficient herbage for his Deer: The Jury finde,
That the Letters Patents of 36. <hi>H.</hi> 8. were abſolutely ſurrendred

which is not <hi>de praemiſſis, ſed de praementionatis.</hi> Now
the King for two hundred pounds Fine, is pleaſed to grant, <hi>tam</hi>
in conſideration of the Surrender, <hi>quàm</hi> for the Fine of two
hundred pounds: And here the King took knowledg, that it
ought to be <hi>in forma ſequente:</hi> and then by reaſon of the Fine
and Surrender, hee is pleaſed to vary from the former Patent,
and it is to the prejudice of the Patentee: The firſt was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
Herbage; and here it is Herbage, and in the Kings Caſe
it amounts to as much, as if hee had ſaid, Reaſonable Herbage:
for becauſe the King excepts the Deer, it is implyed, That the
Patentee is but to have reaſonable Herbage. Here the Grant is
not <hi>De omnibus groſſis arboribus, bonis &amp; catellis Felonum;</hi> and
of the Goods of Felons themſelves: and in the former Patent
theſe were granted, and ſo the Grant is for the Kings benefit, and
to the prejudice of the Patentee. Alſo this Patent is <hi>ad pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficuum
Domini Regis:</hi> For here is a Rent reſerved, and here is
a <hi>Proviſo</hi> for the committing of Waſte in the premiſſes, which
were not in the firſt Letters Patents; and in theſe Letters Patents
there are divers Covenants which were not in the former Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents:
and ſo it is <hi>in forma ſequente:</hi> And ſo the Leaſe of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi>
and <hi>Mary</hi> is good. The King ſeiſed of a Manor to which
he hath a Park, doth grant the Stewardſhip of the Manor, and
the Cuſtodie of the ſaid Park, with reaſonable Herbage: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
in the ſame Letters Patents hee grants the ſaid Manor
of <hi>O.</hi> and all the Lands in <hi>O.</hi> excepting groſſe trees in the Park.
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:40982:212"/>
If this Grant be not good for the Manor, it is not good for the Park
that was the Objection: It is good for the Manor, and alſo for the
Park. It was objected, That the King grants the cuſtody of the Park,
and ſo not the Park it ſelfe; for how can the King grant the cuſtody of
the Park, if he grant the Park it ſelfe; it is dangerous, that upon an
implication in one part of a Patent, the expreſſe words which follow
ſhould be made void; the ſubſequent words in this Caſe, are, The
King grants the Manor, and all the Lands to the ſame belonging; now
the Park doth belong to it, and the King excepts only the Deer, <hi>C. 10
part</hi> 64. The King at this day grants a Manor unto a man, as entirely
as ſuch a one held the ſame before it came into his hands, &amp;c. the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowſon
doth paſſe without words of grant of the Advowſon; for the
Kings meaning is, That the Advowſon ſhall paſſe: The meaning of
the King is manifeſt in our Caſe; <hi>C. 3. Part 31, 32. Carr's</hi> Caſe, There
the Rent was extinct betwixt the Parties<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet for the benefit of the King

have the liberties in it; and ſo here the Park ſhall paſſe, and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
is of the liberties; <hi>Com.</hi> 370. the Exception ought to be of
that which is contained in the former words, in the former Patents;
the Offices were firſt granted; and in the ſame Letters Patents the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor

firſt, and then the Offices. Conſtruction of Statutes ought to be <hi>ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundùm

Note, I have heard Sir <hi>Henry Yelverton</hi> ſay, That it was the opinion
of the Judges in this Caſe, That he had but the cuſtody of the Park, and
not the intereſt of the Park; for that by the acceptance of the cuſtody

money to the Teſtator, upon which he promiſed; And the Action now
brought, is upon the promiſe of the Executor: Part of the promiſe, is,
That he paid the fifty pound to the Teſtator, and that ought to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

was taken, that he doth not ſhew that the Teſtator was dead at the
time of the promiſe by the Executor: It was ſhewed, That after the
death of the Teſtator, that he took upon him the Execution of the Will,
and then promiſed; and that of neceſſity muſt be after the death of
the Teſtator.</p>

point of the common Law, that the conſent of the parties <hi>tollit erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res:
Dodderidg</hi> Juſtice, Two queſtions are in this caſe, 1. If this tryall be
good. 2. Admitting it be not good, whether the aſſent of the parties
doth make it good. Firſt it is a meer matter in the diſcretion of the
Juſtices, which is not tied to any ſtrict rule in Law: In the Book of
the Aſſizes it was tried by the Coroners, becauſe it was in the diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Juſtices: And the Coroners are Miniſters to the Court, and
ought to attend at the Aſſizes. The Book of the Aſſizes is the Report
of the Caſes which happened at the Aſſizes in the Circuits of the Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
and they are not Term caſes. For the Exception which is taken
by him who made the Abridgment of the Book of Aſſizes, is of no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
for the Authour thereof was but a Student, and no Councellor
at Law. In theſe Courts the Coroners do not attend; therefore ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
two, four, or ſix of the Panell are choſen to try thoſe who are
challenged, as the Court ſhall think fit; and if the Triers cannot agree,
we put them together into a room, and ſwear one to keep them, (as a
Jury is kept:) ſo as you ſee it reſts much in the diſcretion of the Juſtices, &amp;
Court: And if there were a certain rule to try it, then it ought to be
ſtrictly obſerved. 31. <hi>Aſſ.</hi> 10. there the triall was <hi>de Circumſtantibus.</hi>
2. The aſſent of the parties doth make it good. It is not a triall in point
of the right of the cauſe, but only of the indifferency of the Miniſters:
The Array was challenged, becauſe the Sheriffe made it at the requeſt
of one of the parties; and the Sheriffe hath confeſſed it upon his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination.
The principal Array ſhal be firſt tried; and if that be quaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
then the <hi>Tales</hi> ſhall not be tried; but if it be affirmed, then two of
the Panell ſhall try the Panell, and two of the <hi>Tales</hi> ſhall try the <hi>Tales.</hi>
This is a triall only of indifference, and not of the fundamentall point
of the Cauſe. If the Plaintiffe require the <hi>Venire facias</hi> to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roners,
becauſe that the Sheriffe is choſen; the Defendant ſhall be
examined if he will agree to it: if he will not agree, but the Sheriffe
returneth the Jury, the Defendant in that caſe ſhall not challenge the
Jury, or any of the Array: The four Knights in the Writ of Right
ſhall chooſe the other twenty of the Grand Aſſize, who ſhall be joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with them, and they ſhall be the Judges of the twenty, when they
are named by them, 39. <hi>E. 3. 2. Haughton</hi> Juſtice, The appearance by
Atturney by aſſent of the parties, is not errour, although by the Law
the Plaintiffe ought for to appear in proper perſon. <hi>Chamberlain</hi>
Juſtice would be adviſed, becauſe he had not ſeen the Books. <hi>Ley</hi> chief
Juſtice, When the whole Panel, as in this caſe, comes to be challenged,
then it is in the diſcretion of the Juſtices to chooſe triers; and chiefly
in this caſe, becauſe all the Array is partiall. If the Coroners be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> is good to take two Atturneys of the Court, who the Court
know to be honeſt by their honeſt carriage, and fair practice. The
aſſent of the parties ſtrengthens this caſe. It is a rule, That the aſſent
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:40982:215"/>
of the parties cannot make that good which is againſt any fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
point of the Law: therefore it is beſt to view the Preſidents, and
to draw a Jurour; but that we cannot do of our ſelves by the Law,
yet with the aſſent of parties we may do it. It is a contempt and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
to the Court, if his aſſent be entred upon record, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
that the Defendant will queſtion the matter by a Writ of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
or otherwiſe relinquiſh his conſent; and for ſuch contempt the
Court may commit him, and fine him alſo: But if the matter be not a
matter of Record, but be onely by a Rule of the Court, then we may
award an Attachment onely againſt the party. In this caſe, the triall
of the Panell was good, and ſo was it afterwards adjudged by the
whole Court. <hi>Quod nota.</hi>

               </hi> contrary, They may

The Statute of 34. <hi>H.</hi> 8. cap. 26. giveth power unto them to
proceed as they proceeded heretofore by Commiſſion. And before
that Statute they proceeded there in caſe of a Legacy; and ſo are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Preſidents; therefore no Prohibition is to iſſue. <hi>Samſon Evers</hi> is
the Kings Atturney for the Marches of <hi>Wales,</hi> and his perſonall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance
is requiſite there: And this Court cannot grant a Prohibition
to ſtay a Suit, when he cannot ſue in this Court for the ſame thing.
<hi>Finch</hi> Recorder contrary. If you ſhew Preſidents, yet they will not
bind this Court, and give power unto them to hold plea of that which
they ought not to hold plea of. It is uſuall to grant a Prohibition, if
the Court of Requeſts holds plea of a Legacy, if it be not by reaſon
of ſome ſpeciall circumſtance; and it is uſuall to diſmiſſe Legacies
out of the Chancery: And no Priviledges ſhal be granted unto an Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor,
Adminiſtrator, or Guardian. <hi>Hyde</hi> Chief Juſtice: Two have an
Obligation as Executors, and the one releaſeth; it is good, and a
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:40982:216"/>
good cauſe of equity againſt him who releaſeth: A Will is made, and
<hi>A.</hi> is made Executor, and no truſt is declared in the Will; and at his
death the Teſtator declares, That his Will is for the benefit of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:
May not this intent be averred? there is nothing more common.
<hi>Dodderidg</hi> Juſtice, For the making of an Eſtate, you cannot averre o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
then the Will is; but as to the diſpoſition of the eſtate, you
may averre. <hi>Jones</hi> Juſtice, There are two Executors; one commits waſt,
or releaſeth, &amp;c. the other hath no remedy at the common Law, for
that breach of Truſt. The reaſon of <hi>Chenyes</hi> caſe, <hi>C.</hi> 5. part is, Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
will deviſe Lands, ought to do it by writing; and if it be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the writing, it is out of the Will, although his intent appeareth
to be otherwiſe. Before the Statute of 34. <hi>H.</hi> 8. cap. 26. The Marches
of <hi>Wales</hi> held plea of all things, for things were not then ſetled. But
the ſaid Statute gave them power and authority to hear and determine
ſuch cauſes and matters as are, or afterwards ſhall be aſſigned to them
by the King, as heretofore had been uſed, and accuſtomed: Now if
it be aſſigned by the King, yet if it be not a thing accuſtomed and uſed
to be pleaded there, it is not there pleadable. So if it be within the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions
made by the King, yet if it be not uſed and accuſtomed, it is
not pleadable there; but it ought to be within the Inſtructions, and alſo
accuſtomed and uſuall; Adultery, Symony, and Incontinency, are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
their Inſtructions, and are accuſtomed. The things being accuſtomed
to be pleaded there, have the ſtrength of an Act of Parliament; but by
the Inſtructions they have no power to proceed in caſe of Legacy.
Then let us ſee if the ſame be included within the generall words (things
of Equity) within the Inſtructions: And then I will be tender in deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
of my opinion, If a Legacy be pleadable there or not? <hi>Whitlock</hi>
Juſtice: The Clergy deſired that they might forbear to intermeddle
with Legacies: Five Biſhops one after the other, were Preſidents of
the Marſhes there: and they draw into the Marches ſpirituall buſineſſe:
but originally it was not ſo; their power was larger then now it is,
for they had power in criminall cauſes, but now they are reſtrained in
that power. There is a common Law Eccleſiaſticall, as well as of our

there is a Latine Court for the Officers of the Court, and the Clarks

            <p>IN Debt brought upon a Bond, the Caſe was, A man was bound in
a Bond, That he ſhould perform, obſerve, and keep the Rule, Order,
and finall end of the Councel of the Marches of <hi>Wales.</hi> And in Debt
brought upon the Bond, the Defendant pleaded, That the Councel of
the Marches of <hi>Wales nullum fecerunt ordinem.</hi> The Plaintiffe replied,
That <hi>Concilium fecerunt ordinem,</hi> that the Defendant ſhould pay unto
the Plaintiffe an hundred pound. The Defendant did demurre in Law
upon the Replication: And the only Queſtion was, If the Plaintiffe in
his Replication ought to name thoſe of the Councel of <hi>Wales,</hi> who made
the Award by their particular names. <hi>Jermyn,</hi> who argued for the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffe,
ſaid, That he ought not to name the Councellors by their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
names; and therefore he ſaid, That if a man be bounden to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the Order that the Privy Councel ſhall make, or the Order which
the Councel ſhould make, That in Debt upon the ſame Bond, If the
Defendant ſaith that he hath performed <hi>Conſilium</hi> generally of the
Councel, without ſhewing the particular names of the Councellors, it
is good. And he vouched 10. <hi>H. 7. 6. 10. E.</hi> 4. 15. and <hi>Com.</hi> 126. Sir
<hi>Richard Buckleys</hi> caſe, That the number of the <hi>Eſliors</hi> ought not to be

<hi>H.</hi> 6. he may declare generally, that he was choſen <hi>per majorem nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi>
and that is good. And 10. <hi>E.</hi> 4. 15. In debt upon a Bond, That
the Defendant ſhall ſerve the Plaintiffe for a year, <hi>in omnibus mandatis
ſuis licitis:</hi> The Defendant ſaid, That he did truely ſerve the Plaintiff
untill ſuch a day as he was diſcharged; And it is there holden, that
he is not compellable to ſhew the certainty of the ſervices. <hi>Banks</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
and ſaid, That he ought to name the Councel by their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
names: And therefore in this caſe he ought to have pleaded ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
as in 9. <hi>E.</hi> 4. 24. If a man will plead a Divorce, Deprivation,
or a Deraignment, he ought to ſhew before what Judge the Divorce,
Deprivation, or Deraignment was: So 1. <hi>H.</hi> 7. 10. If a man will plead
a Fine, he muſt ſhew before what Judges the Fine was levied, although
they be Judges of Record. And he took this difference, That the Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
ought to take notice of the Juriſdiction of generall Courts, which
are Courts of Record, and of the Cuſtomes of thoſe Courts: but of
particular Courts which have but particular Juriſdictions, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Cuſtomes, the Judges are not to take notice of them, nor of the
Lawes and Cuſtomes of ſuch Courts, if they be not ſpecially ſhewed
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:40982:218"/>
unto them. And therefore although it was alledged, That it was the
generall uſage to plead Awards, or Orders made before the Councel of
the Marches of <hi>Wales,</hi> as in the principall Caſe, yet he held that the
Judges were not to take notice thereof. And therefore the Councellors
who made the Order, ought to be particularly named. 2. He ſaid that
the Replication was not good, becauſe the Plaintiffe in his Replication
doth not ſhew that the Order was made by the Preſident, and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel;
for by the Statute of 34. <hi>H.</hi> 8. it ought to be made by the Preſident,
and the Councel. 3. He ſaid, That the Replication was not good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Plaintiffe doth not ſhew within the Record, that the matter
of which the Order was made, was a matter which was within their
Juriſdiction. It was adjourned.</p>

            <head>502 SHUTFORD and BOROUGH's Caſe.</head>
            <p>IN an Action upon the Caſe upon a Promiſe, the Caſe was this, The
Defendant had a dog which did kill five of the Plaintiff's ſheep, and
the Defendant in conſideration the Plaintiffe would not ſue him for the
ſaid ſheep; and alſo in conſideration that the Plaintiff would ſuffer the
Defendant to do away the ſheep, promiſed to give him recompence for
the ſaid ſheep upon requeſt: and the Plaintiffe alledged the promiſe
to be made, 18. <hi>Jacobi,</hi> and that afterwards 2. <hi>Caroli,</hi> he did requeſt ſo
much of the Defendant for the ſaid ſheep: The Defendant pleaded in
Bar the Statute of 21. <hi>Jacobi,</hi> cap 16. of Limitation of Actions, and
alledged, That the Action was not brought within ſix years after the
cauſe of action accrued: which was the promiſe. And it was adjudged
that the plea in Bar was not good; for it was reſolved, That where a
thing is to be done upon requeſt, that there, untill requeſt, there is no
cauſe of Action; and the time and place of the requeſt is iſſuable. And ſo
was reſolved, 1. <hi>Caroli,</hi> in the Kings Bench in <hi>Peck's</hi> Caſe: and <hi>Hill.
16. Jacobi,</hi> in the ſame Court in <hi>Hill</hi> and <hi>Wades</hi> Caſe; and in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
Caſe the requeſt was, 2. <hi>Caroli,</hi> and that was within the time li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
by the Statute of 21. <hi>Jacobi.</hi> And the meaning of the Statute was,
but to barre the Plaintiffe but from the time that he had compleat cauſe
of Action, and that was not untill the requeſt made. And when divers
things are to be done and performed before a man can have an Action,
there all theſe things ought to be compleated before the Action can be
brought. And therefore, If a man promiſe to pay <hi>I. S.</hi> ten pound when
he is married, or when he is returned from <hi>Rome,</hi> and ten years after
the promiſe, <hi>I. S.</hi> marrieth, or returneth from <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:40982:219"/>
or the Returne from <hi>Rome</hi> are the cauſes of the Action, that the
party ſhall have ſix years after his marriage, or return to bring his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
although that the promiſe was made ten years before. And in the
principall Caſe, the cauſe of Action is the breach, and that cannot be
untill after the Requeſt made; and where a Requeſt is material, it ought
to be ſhewed in pleading<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And ſo it was reſolved by the whole Court,

            <head>510 The King, and BAXTER &amp; SIMMON's Caſe.</head>
            <p>THE Caſe was this, Tenant in tail the Remainder in taile, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
in Fee to Tenant in tail in poſſeſſion: Tenant in tail in
Remainder by Deed enrolled, reciting that he had an eſtate tail in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder,
Granted his Remainder and all his eſtate and right unto the
King and his Heirs, <hi>Proviſo,</hi> that if he pay ten ſhillings at the Receipt
of the Exchequer, that then the Grant ſhall be void. Tenant in tail in
poſſeſſion ſuffers a common Recovery, and afterwards deviſeth the
Lands to <hi>I. S.</hi> and dieth without Iſſue 18. <hi>Jacobi.</hi> Afterwards 21. <hi>Jac.</hi>
he in the Remainder in tail dieth without iſſue; but no ſeiſure is made,
nor Offence found, that the lands were in the Kings hands.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Noy,</hi> who argued for the King: The firſt Point is, When Tenant in
taile recites his eſtate, and grants all his eſtate and right to the King and
his Heirs, what eſtate the King hath? And if by the death of Tenant in
tail without iſſue, the eſtate of the King be ſo abſolutly determined, that
the Kings poſſeſſion needs not to be removed by <hi>Amoveas manum:</hi> And
he argued, That when the Lands are once in the King, that they cannot be
out of him again, but by matter of Record. 8. <hi>E. 3. 12. Com.</hi> 558. And
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:40982:221"/>
a bare entry upon the King, doth not put the King out of poſſeſſion of
that which was once in him: And ſo was it adjudged 34. <hi>Eliz.</hi> in the
Lord <hi>Paget's</hi> Caſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as <hi>Walter</hi> chief Baron ſaid. And <hi>Noy</hi> took this
difference, 8. <hi>H. 5. Traverſe</hi> 47. and 8. <hi>E. 2. Traverſe</hi> 48. If a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
eſtate doth determine before that the King ſeiſe, there the King can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
afterwards ſeiſe the Lands. But if the King hath once the Lands in
his hands or poſſeſſion, there they cannot be deveſted out of him but by
matter of Record. So <hi>F. Nat. Br.</hi> 254. If a man be ſeiſed of Lands
in the right of his Wife, and be outlawed for Felonie, for which the
Lands come into the Kings hands, and afterwards hee who is outlawed
dieth; there a Writ of <hi>Diem clauſit extremum</hi> ſhall iſſue forth: which
proveth, That by the death of the Husband the Lands are not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
out of the King, and ſetled in the Wife againe. 22. <hi>E. 4. Fitz.
Petition</hi> 9. Tenant in taile is attainted of Treaſon, and the Lands ſeiſed
into the Kings hands; and afterwards Tenant in taile dieth without Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue,
he in the Remainder is put to his Petition: which proveth, that the
Lands are not preſently after the death of Tenant in taile without iſſue,
out of the King. But he agreed the Caſes: If Tenant in taile acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth
a Statute, or granteth a Rent charge, and dieth, that the Rent
is gone and determined by his death, as it is agreed in 14. <hi>Aſſiſarum.</hi>
The ſecond point argued by <hi>Noy,</hi> was; That although that there was
not any ſeizure or Offence found which entituled the King, Yet the Deed
enrolled in the Chancery which is returned in this Court, did make ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
title for the King: &amp; as 8. <hi>E. 3. p.</hi> 3. is, The Judges of Courts ought
to Judge upon the Records of the ſame Courts. In 8. <hi>H.</hi> 7. 11. a Bayliff
ſhewed, That a Leaſe was made to <hi>T.</hi> his Maſter for life, the Remainder
to the King in Fee, and prayed in Ayd of the King: And the Plaintiff in
Chancery prayed a <hi>Procedendo:</hi> And it was ruled That a <hi>Procedendo</hi> ſhould
not be granted without examination of the Kings title. Thirdly, he ſaid,
That in this caſe he who will have the Lands out of the poſſeſſion of the
King, ought to ſhew forth his title; and in the principall caſe it doth
not appear that the Defendant had any title. <hi>Vide 10. H. 7. 13. Athowe</hi>
Serjeant argued for the Defendant, &amp; he ſaid, That in this caſe the King
had an eſtate but for the life of Tenant in tail. And therefore he ſaid,
That If Tenant in tail grant <hi>totum ſtatum ſuum,</hi> that an eſtate but for his
own life paſſeth, as <hi>Litt.</hi> is, 145. and 13. <hi>H. 7. 10. acc.</hi> So If Tenant for life
the remainder in taile bee, and he in the Remainder releaſeth to Tenant
for life in poſſeſſion, nothing paſſeth but for the life of Tenant in tail. 19.
<hi>H.</hi> 6. 60. If Tenant in tail be attainted of Treaſon or Felonie, and Offence
is found, and the King ſeiſeth the lands, he hath an eſtate but for the life
of Tenant in tail. And he cited 35. <hi>Eliz. C.</hi> 2 part 52. <hi>Blithmans</hi> caſe.
Where Tenant in tail Covenanted to ſtand ſeized to the uſe of himſelf for
his own life, and after his death to the uſe of his eldeſt ſon in tail, and
afterwards he married a wife and died; that the wife ſhould not be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed:
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:40982:221"/>
for when he had limited the uſe to himſelf for his life, he
could not limit ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Remainder over. And <hi>Edwards</hi> Caſe, adjudged in
the Court of Wards, which was, That there was Tenant for life the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
in tail, he in the Remainder granted his Remainder to <hi>I. S.</hi> and
his heirs; and afterwards Tenant for life dyed, and then the grantee dyed,
his heirs within age, &amp; it was adjudged that the heir of the garntee ſhould
not be in ward, becauſe the Tenant in tail could not by his Grant grant
a greater eſtate then for his own life. But he ſaid, That in the principall
Caſe it appeareth, That the Tenant in tail in Remainder hath particularly
recited his eſtate. And where it appeareth in the Conveyance it ſelf, that
he hath but an eſtate in tail, a greater eſtate ſhall not paſſe. As if Tenant
for life granteth a Rent to one and his heirs, the ſame at the firſt ſight
ſeems to be a good Rent in Fee; but when it appeareth in the Conveyance
that the grantor was but Tenant for life, there, upon the Conſtruction of
the Deed it ſelf, it cannot be intended that he granted a Fee, but that
an eſtate for life paſſed only in the Rent. Secondly, he argued, That
although the eſtate in tail in the principall caſe was an abeyance; Yet
a Common Recovery would barr ſuch eſtate tail in abeyance. And
therewith agreeth <hi>C.</hi> 2. part S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Hugh Cholmleys</hi> Caſe. 3. He ſaid, That the
eſtate was out of the King, and veſted in the party without any Offence
found, as 49. <hi>E. 3. Iſabell Goodcheaps</hi> caſe. A man deviſed houſes in
<hi>London</hi> holden of the King in tail, and if the Donee dyed without
Iſſue, that the Lands ſhould be ſold by his Executors. The deviſee
died without Iſſue, The bargain and ſale of the Lands by the Executor
doth divert the eſtate out of the King without Petition, or <hi>Monſtrans de
Droit.</hi> So, If there be Tenant in tail the Remainder in tail, and Tenant in
tail <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n Remainder levieth a fine of his Remainder to the King, and
afterwards dyeth without Iſſue, the Kings eſtate is determined, and there
needs no Petition or <hi>Monstrans de Droit.</hi> 4. He ſaid, That in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
caſe, nothing was in the King, becauſe it doth not appeare that
there was any ſeiſure, or Offence found to entitle the King. And the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
in tail in the Remainder died in the life of King <hi>James;</hi> and then
if the Kings eſtate were then determined as before by the death of the
Tenant in taile, the King which now is never had any title. And hee
ſaid, that he needed not to ſhew a greater title then he had. And hee
took a difference when Tenant in taile doth onely defend or make de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
and when he makes title to Lands; in the one Caſe he ought for
to ſhew, That the Tenant in taile died without iſſue, and in the other
Caſe not: And therefore in the principall caſe he demanded Judgment
for the Defendant. The Caſe was adjourned to another day.</p>

            <p>A Bill was preferred againſt the Defendant, for a Conſpiracy to
Indict the plaintiff of a Rape. And the Plaintiff aleadged in his
Bill, That an Indictment was preferred by the Defendant againſt the
Plaintiff before the Juſtices of Aſſiſe and <hi>Niſi prius</hi> in the County of
Suffolk; And did not lay it in his Bill, that the Indictment was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
before the Juſtices of <hi>Oyer and Terminer,</hi> and Gaole delivery: and
the ſame was holden by the Court to be a good Exception to the Bill,
for that the Juſtices of Aſſiſe and <hi>Niſi prius,</hi> have not power to take
Indictments. But afterwards upon veiw of the Bill, becauſe the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy
was the principall thing tryable and examinable in this Court,
and that was well layd in the Bill, the Bill was retayned, and the
Court proceded to Sentence. And in this Caſe <hi>Richardſon</hi> Juſtice ſaid,
That in Conſpiracy the matter muſt bee layed to be <hi>falſè et malitioſè:</hi>
and if it be layed for a Rape, It muſt be layd, that there was <hi>recens

the Defendant did not preferre an Indictment of Rape, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
time after the Rape ſuppoſed to be done, but concealed the
ſame for half a years time, and then would have preferred a Bill of
Indictment againſt the plaintiff for the ſame Rape, he held that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment
was falſe and malitious. And <hi>Hyde</hi> Chief Juſtice ſaid, That
upon probable proof a man might accuſe another before any Juſtice
of Peace, of an Offence; and although his accuſation be falſe, yet
the Accuſer ſhall not be puniſhed for it. But where the Accuſation
is malitious and falſe, it is otherwiſe; and for ſuch Accuſation he ſhall be

<hi>Thomas Spence</hi> and his Wife and the Survivor, the Rent of ſeventeen
Pounds yearly, and every year during the terme; <hi>Proviſo,</hi> that if
the Rent be arrere by forty daies, that <hi>Thomas</hi> and his Wife, or the
Survivor of them ſhould enter. <hi>Thomas Spence</hi> died, his Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
did demand the Rent, and being denied, entred for the Condition
broken. <hi>Calthrope</hi> argued, That the reſervation to the Wife was void
becauſe ſhe had not any intereſt in the Land, and alſo never ſealed the
Indenture of Aſſignment, but was as a ſtranger to the Deed, and ſo he ſaid
that the Wife could not enter for the condition broken, nor make any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the Rent. The 2<hi rend="sup">l</hi> Point was, Admitting that the wife could not
enter, nor demand the Rent; Whether the Adminiſtrator of the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
might demand it and enter for the condition broken; becauſe the
words are, Yeilding and paying to <hi>Thomas Spence</hi> and <hi>Jane</hi> his Wife, and
the Survivor of them during the term, and no words of Executors or Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
are in the Caſe: and he conceived the Adminiſtrator could not;
and ſo he ſaid it had been reſolved in one <hi>Butcher</hi> and <hi>Richmonds</hi> Caſe,
about 6. <hi>Jacobi. Banks</hi> contrary, and he ſaid, It was a good Rent and
well demanded, and the reſervation is good during the Term, to the
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:40982:224"/>
Huſband and Wife; and although the word <hi>Reddendo</hi> doth not create
a rent to the Wife, becauſe the Husband cannot give to the Wife; yet
the <hi>Solvendo</hi> ſhall gain a good rent to the Wife, during the life of the
Wife; and the reſervation ſhall be a good reſervation to him and his

makes the Rent good to the Wife, and amounts to an agreement of the
Leſſee to pay the Rent to them, and the Survivor of them; and that
which cannot be good by way of reſervation, yet is good by way of

hath no title, and the Wife is no party to the Deed, and
therefore the Rent is gone by the death of the Husband. If it had been
<hi>durante termino</hi> generally, perhaps it had been good; but <hi>durante ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mino
praedicto</hi> to him and his Wife, it ceaſeth by his death. And the
words <hi>durante termino,</hi> couple it to him and his Wife, and the Survivor;
and it cannot be good to the Wife who is no party, nor ſealed the
Deed; neither can it inure to the Wife by way of Grant. And the
words <hi>Reddendo</hi> and <hi>Solvendo</hi> are <hi>Synonima;</hi> and the Adminiſtrator
is no Aſſignee of the Survivor, for ſhe cannot aſſign becauſe ſhe hath
no right in the Rent. <hi>Barkley</hi> Juſtice, The intention of the parties was,
That it ſhould be a continuing Rent, and Judges are to make ſuch Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition

I do agree, That the Wife could not have the Rent, neither by way of
Reſervation, nor by way of Grant, if ſhe were not a party to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denture:
