            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And on the 27<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>June</hi> their Honours did make a Large report to the <hi>Lords</hi> of the Admiralty full of Reflections, prevarications, and Manifeſt Falſehoods; wherein they ſet forth that they have not Heard of any of the ſaid Miſcarriages.

to be as before Repreſented; I gave their <hi>Lordſhips</hi> an anſwer ther eunto in Writing, and did alſo move their <hi>Lordſhips,</hi> to hear Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to prove my allegations, in order to refute the ſaid Report, and diſcover the ſaid Enormitys committed in the ſaid Yards, and after ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral delays and Diſapointments, my requeſt, upon the motion of <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell Auſtin</hi> deceaſed, was allowed, and a time apointed to hear them; <hi>viz.</hi> the 30<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> 1694.

Propoſer Imagined. All which his <hi>Majeſty</hi> on the 31. of <hi>January,</hi> was Pleaſed further to refer to the <hi>Lords</hi> of his moſt Honourable Privy Councell, appointed a Committee of Trade and Plantations; before whom, on the 1 of <hi>April,</hi> the report of the <hi>Navy-Board,</hi> was proved to be Falſe and Prejudicial to his <hi>Majeſtys</hi> Service; and that Several o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Illegall Practcies were ſo fully proved before their <hi>Lordſhips,</hi> againſt Se<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>veral Officers belonging to the ſaid Yards then preſent, that the Preſident of the Councill did declare, that Plain matter of Fact was fully proved againſt them; And that moſt Honourable Board did alſo declare that it was high time to make a Reformation in his <hi>Majeſtys</hi> Yards, and that they would appoint a time to Conſider of the means. But the propoſer Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that Nothing could conduce ſo much to an Effectual cure as the laying the Wound more open, did on the 6<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>April</hi> lay before their <hi>Lordſhips</hi> Several aditionall Articles relating thereunto, which their <hi>Lordſhips</hi> did gratefully receive; giveing the propoſer Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment beyond Expectation; but on the diſcovery of the Plot (as I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) their <hi>Lordſhips</hi> time then not permitting to Examine the ſame, that matter was referred to the <hi>Lords</hi> of the Admiralty, where the ſaid abuſes were ſo fully and plainly proved, that one of their <hi>Lordſhips</hi> did So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly proteſt that things were come to ſuch a paſs, that he did Believe it was Impoſſible for an Honeſt man to be amongſt them. And after I had proved what I had offered, (the whole matter being Several days under Examination, which is Briefly drawn up in five Sheets of Paper ready to be produced) Their <hi>Lordſhips</hi> did in <hi>September</hi> 95 make another report to the <hi>Lords</hi> of his <hi>Majeſties</hi> moſt Honourable Privy Councill, apointed a Committee as aforeſaid, wherein they Set forth that they had heard the Propoſer, and other evidence, and that they had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed Several offenders, and ſigned ordres to prevent the like abuſes for the Future. But I never heard of more then one Perſon <hi>viz.</hi> the Maſter <hi>Boatmaker</hi> of <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> that was diſmiſt amongſt them all. After this the <hi>Lords</hi> of the Councill appointed a Committee as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid the 3<hi>d.</hi> of <hi>Febuary</hi> 9⅚ did ſend for me and at my appearance did tell me that it did appear to them, that I had done the <hi>Nation</hi> a Sigual Piece of Service; and that I ſhould be well rewarded for the ſame; directing the Clark of the Councill then attending, to draw up their Report to the <hi>King,</hi> highly in my Favour; and that moſt Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>Board</hi> did then alſo move his Grace the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend me to his <hi>Majeſty</hi> for a reward; whereby his <hi>Majeſty</hi> by an order of the 2<hi>d.</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> 95. was Graciouſly pleaſed to direct the <hi>Lords</hi> of the <hi>Admiralty</hi> to put me in ſome Employment in the <hi>Navy,</hi> or give me a Suitable reward and Bounty for my good Service, Care and Pains: which after Three Years attendance to my Damage, in Expence of time and Money 500.

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:39003:4"/>
               <hi>Admiralty</hi> and <hi>Navy-board,</hi> yet I do affirm (that which no Unbyaſſed Perſon can deny) that the ſaid Summ of 100000.

            <p n="2">2 That in the Year 95. I Printed and delivered Propoſals to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> for ſupplying the Royal <hi>Navy</hi> with able <hi>Seamen</hi> and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners</hi> upon all occaſions, and Preventing many abuſes committed by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly <hi>Preſſmaſters,</hi> both by <hi>Sea</hi> and Land, together with the ſaving Severall Immence Summs of Money, Yearly Expended in Impreſs, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and Bounty Money, with the Charge occſioned by employing <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmacks,</hi> and keeping <hi>Seamen</hi> in pay the <hi>Winter</hi> Seaſon, and ſecureing the Publick Trade of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> in time of War, as alſo preventing Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Hardſhips impoſed on <hi>Seamen,</hi> and <hi>Marriners,</hi> to the ruin of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Thouſands of them and their Families, as is Set forth at Large in the ſaid Propoſall.</p>
            <p n="3">3 After this being informed of great Embezelments made of his <hi>Majeſties Navall-ſtores,</hi> and being Encouraged by his <hi>Majeſtys Royal Proclamation</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 93.

               <hi>Warrants</hi> but had not any returns made thereof; yet I made ſuch diſcoveries, that one of the <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> at the <hi>Board</hi> told me he Believed all the <hi>Merchants-Ships,</hi> were fitted with the <hi>King's Stores,</hi> and at <hi>Harwich</hi> I Seized ſeveral Parcells of the <hi>King's Navall-Stores;</hi> Perticularly one great parcell of New cordage to the Value of 65 Pounds, which upon a Tryal ill Managed a verdict, about two Years after, was given againſt the <hi>King,</hi> and that my ſelf and others (for ſeizing the ſame) were abuſed as thieves and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and our veſſell hired by the <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> of the <hi>Navy,</hi> was Seized by an Officer of the <hi>Cuſtom-houſe,</hi> to the Great Prejudice of the owner, as alſo of my ſelf and others: yet it is moſt notoriouſly evident, that the ſaid Goods were really Embezeled Stores, as the <hi>Lords</hi> of the <hi>Admiralty</hi> did confeſs, and I can plainly make appear, with the whole proceedings of that Voyage, and the refractory proceedings of Several of his <hi>Majeſties</hi> officers belonging to that Place, with their rejecting and contemning his <hi>Majeſtys</hi> Royal <hi>Proclamation,</hi> as alſo the <hi>Warrants</hi> gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Right honourable the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Romney,</hi> and the <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> of the <hi>Navy.</hi> A Complaint at large hath been laid before the ſaid <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners</hi> and the <hi>Lords</hi> of the <hi>Admiralty,</hi> and Several <hi>Affidavits</hi> made thereupon without the leaſt Redreſs: and the ſaid <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> of the

               <hi>Navy,</hi> to ſtop my further Progreſs in that matter, have not only denied their <hi>Warrants</hi> to Search, but did alſo refuſe to pay the Thirds Purſuant to his <hi>Majeſties</hi> ſaid <hi>Proclamation;</hi> untill the Offenders were convicted: and to put a full ſtop to ſuch diſcoverys, they have often declared, that the ſaid <hi>Proclamation</hi> was againſt the Law, and have Threatened me at their Board for aſſerting his <hi>Majeſties</hi> Perogative in granting the ſame. And by their Employing their Sollicitor Mr. <hi>Whitaker,</hi> to Proſecute the Offenders, as by many Letters I have in my cuſtody it is manifeſt they did, many offences were Stifled, and Several others, <hi>viz.</hi> 12 <hi>Bills</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred and found at <hi>Hickſes-hall</hi> in <hi>July</hi> 95. with others Indicted at other times and in other Countys, were never proſecuted, whereby that Service was obſtructed; foraſmuch as there could be no convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without a proſecution, nor no rewards before Conviction; with many other Obſtructions too many here to Enumerate. And Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints thereof being made to the Admiralty and <hi>Navy</hi> Boards, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the matter to him the ſaid <hi>Whitaker<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p n="4">4 About two Years ſince I made propoſals to the <hi>King</hi> to ſave one Quarter part of what was expended in Tranſporting his <hi>Majeſties</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,

            <p n="5">5 That on the 2<hi>d.</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> 97.

            <p>In <hi>February</hi> 97. I preſented his <hi>Majeſty</hi> in Council with a Propoſal for the re-building <hi>White-Hall,</hi> out of the Imbezelments of prizes and prize goods and did alſo propoſe to Clear the Ruines thereof for 1000. Pound (but could never get the ſame Read.)</p>
            <p>At the Firſt Sitting of the laſt Seſſions of Parliament, I made propoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls to the right Honourable the Lords of his <hi>Majeſtys</hi> Treaſury for raiſing 4500000.

            <p>And in <hi>April</hi> laſt, my ſelf, with a Friend, made diſcoverys to the <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> of the Cuſtomes of 39.

            <p n="8">8 And whereas by one Act of Parliament made <hi>Anno quarto et quinto</hi> of his Preſent <hi>Majeſty</hi> and the late <hi>Queen;</hi> Entituled an Act for continuing the Acts for prohibiting all Trade and Comerce with <hi>France,</hi> and for Encouragement of privateers; It was enacted that all prize <hi>Ships</hi> and goods, ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved entire and free from Embezlements and not be Pillaged in any caſe whatſoever; with Directions for Selling the ſame, and applying the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed there of for the Uſe of his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> and the encouragement of <hi>Seamen.</hi> And hearing by dayly Complaints how the ſaid Act was Violated by Seve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ral Commanders of his <hi>Majeſtys</hi> Ships, who not regarding the ſaid Law, did frequently Sell ſuch Ships and goods by Wholeſale, as alſo great part. of the <hi>Cargo</hi> and Furniture of others, to the great Prejudice of his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi> and <hi>Seamen,</hi> who thereby were deprived of their Shares and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions allowed by the ſaid Act. And in order ſuch Commanders ſhould make Reſtitution, (about 12 Months ſince) I certified the ſame to the <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> for Prizes, who Promiſed to give me a reward if I could make it appear; which accordingly I did, and two Ships, upon the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that I producd, were condemned in the <hi>Admiralty</hi> Court the 10<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>March</hi> laſt, but the ſaid <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> ſending for the <hi>Capt.</hi> that ſold them, he produced an account upon Oath in the Nature of Debtor, and Creditor, and in the Ballance remains Debtor to the <hi>King</hi> about 30.

not proceed any further, whereby thoſe Embezlements to the value of 10000<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Pound were wholely loſt, without any Recompence for my charge, and trouble. Theſe and Several other great Embezlements, abuſes and enormitys relating thereunto, I laid before the right Honourable the Lords of his <hi>Majeſtys</hi> Treaſury the 20<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>January</hi> laſt, their <hi>Lordſhips</hi> then directing me to prove the Allegations thereof, which by ſubſtantiall Evidence I could do if I were at liberty.</p>
            <p n="9">9 In <hi>December</hi> laſt I laid before the <hi>Lords</hi> of the <hi>Admiralty</hi> a Moddell of an Invention for the Effectual weighing of great Anchors, in any Weather, far beyond any contrivance for that Service, (which by Demonſtrable proof I can readyly make appear) which haveing paſt their <hi>Lordſhips</hi> approbation, with the <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> of the <hi>Navy</hi> then preſent, is now remaining, by their <hi>Lordſhips</hi> order, at their Office under conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</p>
            <p n="10">10 And whereas by one other Act paſſed the laſt Seſſions of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament entituled an Act for the better Preventing the Imbezlements of his <hi>Majeſtys</hi> Stores of War &amp;c.

            <p n="11">11 And having ſince the 20<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi> laſt (being encouraged by the ſaid Act) made Several diſcoverys of <hi>Navall</hi> Stores, marked with the <hi>King's</hi> Mark<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I did, with one <hi>John Sartain,</hi> Indict Several offenders at <hi>Hickſes-Hall</hi> the begining of <hi>September,</hi> and before we received No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice for tryal, the ſaid <hi>John Sartain</hi> did apply himſelf to the <hi>Lord's</hi> of the <hi>Admiralty,</hi> who promiſed him great encouragement, telling him that they would direct the <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> of the <hi>Navy</hi> to take his diſcoverys<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and proſecute the Offenders, but his reward ſhould come from them. And upon his attending the ſaid <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> they directed him to give them an account of all diſcoverys, which accordingly he did; and their Honours gave him their <hi>Warrants,</hi> directed to his <hi>Majeſtys</hi> Peace Officers, to bring the Offenders before them or ſome other <hi>Juſtices</hi> of the Peace,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:39003:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to anſwer the Premiſes. Purſuant thereunto Several offenders were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried before them, and Diſcharged by them, without takeing any Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of the Fact; which being notified to other <hi>Juſtices</hi> they refuſed to meddle therein. And when the Perſons Indicted were to be tryed, Mr. <hi>Whitaker</hi> Sollicitor to the <hi>Admiralty</hi> and <hi>Navy-Board</hi> (being directed by them to proſecute the Several Offenders) did adviſe us that the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments we had laid were not good in Law; and that he had prepared others which were prefered and found by the <hi>Grand-Jury,</hi> and the former quaſht; and when thoſe cauſes came to be tryed, the Court was of Opinion, that they had not Power by the ſaid Act to try the ſame? whereby the Offenders were acquitted. After which I deſired they might be indicted in the Crown office, but Mr. <hi>Whitaker</hi> alledged that was not a proper place, adding that the ſaid Act was defective, and that he would take care it ſhould be amended the next Seſſions of <hi>Parliament,</hi> and that in the mean time he would Indict them at <hi>Hickſes-hall</hi> for Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes and Miſdemeanors and after they were convicted he would ſue for the Penalty in one of his <hi>Majeſties</hi> Courts at <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi> But being urgent to carry on the Proſecutions I attended him before the laſt Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Peace, and then he told me he would Proſecute all thoſe, within the Iuridiction of the <hi>Old-Bayly,</hi> in that Court, at their next Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the others at the <hi>Aſſizes;</hi> he being adviſed by the <hi>Kings</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill that the <hi>Quarter-Seſſions</hi> was not a Proper place, directing me to give him a Liſt of all diſcoverys above 20 s. Value, adding that the Smaller matters ſhould be refered to the <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> of the <hi>Navy,</hi> for that the Proſecuting, ſuch would be lookt upon in Court as Vexatious and oppreſſive to the Subject. Purſuant thereunto I did forthwith carry a Liſt of all ſuch diſcoverys, but he not being to be found; I did the next day ſend the ſame by <hi>John Sartain</hi> who delivered it to Mr. <hi>Whitaker,</hi> and then Mr. <hi>Whitaker</hi> told him that the <hi>Old-Bayly</hi> was not a proper place to ſue in, but he would proſecute them Above this Term, directing the ſaid <hi>Sartain</hi> then to attend him.

the whole Kingdom; and to prevent me from carrying on my Proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the Dice are turned upon me, and the Offenders, by a ſecret Combination, are become my Proſecuters, which I humbly conceive is contrary to the Conſtitution of this Government, foraſmuch as I have Endeavoured, as much as in me lay, to proſecute the Offenders, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting Informations and perferring Indictments againſt them as before recited, for which I conceive I ought to have the priority in Proſecut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and then if they or any other Perſon can charge me of doing any Unlawful act either in Perjudice to the King or Subject, that then they may proceed againſt me according to the utmoſt Severity of the Law. But being ſupprized and carried before Sir <hi>John Houbland,</hi> who would not accept of any but City Bail, which I having no Acquaintance there could not produce, I was Committed as aforeſaid the 21<hi>ſt.</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> and on the 26<hi>th.</hi> Summoned on the Penalty of 100 <hi>l.</hi> to make my Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal appearance at the <hi>Kings-Bench-Bar</hi> (on the 30<hi>th)</hi> to Anſwer an Information in the Crown againſt me for certain Treſpaſſes, Contempts and Miſdemeanors. Being Informed the 15<hi>th.</hi> Inſtant, that no Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was then Filled againſt me, and being charged with ſo black a Crime, my Friends were affraid to come near me, ſome of them being threatned with the ſame Fate if they do aſſiſt me, ſo that being deprived of Friends and bare of Money by reaſon of my ſeveral Services for the Publick Good; Being Ignorant in the Law and without Advice am now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in a Deplorable Condition, not knowing how to defend my ſelf againſt this violent Proſecution. And the ſaid <hi>John Sartaine</hi> is Bound by Reculliſans to appear at the <hi>Old-Baily</hi> the next <hi>Seſſions</hi> of the Peace, and is alſo Summoned on the Penalty of 100 <hi>l.</hi> to anſwer an Information at the <hi>Kings-Bench Bar</hi> for the aforeſaid pretended Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and my ſelf Confined a Priſoner in the City liable to the ſame Penalty for not appearing at the <hi>Kings-Banch-Bar</hi> according to Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</p>
            <p n="14">14. The Premiſes thus truly ſtated, manifeſt it is, that the Villifiing and abuſing me, as a Rogue of the greateſt Rank, for doing the Duty of a Faithful Subject, for putting the Laws in Execution, is (as I humbly conceive) a Reflection upon the Judicious proceedings of the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers; foraſmuch as the ſame Reaſon that induced them to make ſuch Laws, encouraged me to put the ſame in Execution, and whereas I am charged for ſtifling Proſecutions, I do moſt humbly take leave to acquaint <gap reason="illegible: scratched out" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> Honours that after the expence of 30 <hi>l.</hi> in Proſecuting a Captain the laſt <hi>Mickahnus</hi> Term for Embezeling a Prize-Ship and Goods to the value of 80000 <hi>l.</hi> after two motions to defer the ſame, and two appointments for the Tryal, the laſt of which was the laſt day but one of their ſitting out of Term, altho the Cauſe was called, and the Jury ready to be ſworn, I was then diſappointed by reaſon that one of my Counſel (after he
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:39003:9"/>
had taken his Fees) departed the Court; true it is the Lord Chief Barron, to his everlaſting Praiſe, did as much as in him lay to bring the Cauſe to Tryal, which being about Nine of the Clock in the Evening, did declare that he would be contented to hear it that Night or the next Morning or Afternoon, adding that there ſhould be no Complaint againſt him; ſo that if any neglect has been in carring on any Proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions I humbly conceive it ought not to be laid to my Charge.</p>
            <p n="15">15. And foraſmuch as it is the undoubted Right of this Honourable Houſe to enquire into and Redreſs Publick grievances, ſo I humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that every Subject hath the Priviledge to lay ſuch grievances be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, provided it be done with decency and reſpect; and finding (by dear-bought Experience) that no Redreſs was to be obtained elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, I did (with moſt humble Submiſſion) preſent to this Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Houſe, in hopes of their Honours Protection, the aforeſaid Paper Intituled, <hi>A word in Seaſon,</hi> wherein is ſet forth, under ſeveral heads, many Publick and unparaleld grievances committed during the late War, which I ſhall be ready to prove whenſoever this Honourable Houſe will be pleaſed to hear the ſame, whereby it will Evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear what Perſons has been employed in the Adminiſtration of Publick Affairs, and how far I have Indeavoured to promote the Publick In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt; Moſt humbly praying your Honours to conſider the ſtrength of my Powerful Adverſaries, and vouchſafe to ſheild me under the Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Honourable Houſe, until ſome method may be found for carring on thoſe Proſecutions which (it is ſaid) I have Compounded and Stifled; not that I fear the Law, but being (for my Integrity and Diligence) ſurrounded with many potent Enemies, who, if it be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, will turn the true Courſe of the Law to my prejudice, which if I can but obtain the favour of being heard before a Commitee of this Honourable Houſe, I doubt not to make my Innocence appear and gain Repute thereby; which to effect, having little Acquaintance with the Honourable Members of this Houſe and being under Confinement, I do moſt humbly pray that this my Caſe may obtain the effect of a Petition and that a Commite may be appointed to examine the Allegations there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, otherwiſe no Perſon can be in ſafety that doth apeare againſt Publick Offenders, who if their Merſenary, Corrupt and Illegal Practiſes be countenanced and continued, then it conſequently follows that the generality of Mankind will indeavour to Imitate them, whereby the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of all that is Good will be defeated, and this once ſo Flouriſhing a Kingdom, become the moſt miſerable, without hopes of Recovery.</p>

altho ſince reduced, by carring on my ſeveral ſervices. In all which if it ſhould appear to this moſt Honourable Houſe, that the detecting and diſcovering Publick grievances and the making propoſals and tenders to ſave the Publick Treaſure, and to ſerve the Publick as I have done, is now become ſo great a Crime, that then I (who conceived other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe) may for this time obtain a Pardon for my ſimple Integrity, and that ſome Law may be paſſed to make the ſame Criminal for the future, to the end other well-meaning Perſons may avoid the like unhappy Fate.</p>
