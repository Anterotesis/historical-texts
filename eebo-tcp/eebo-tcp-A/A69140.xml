            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And ſo the bleſſed Apoſtle comments vpon this text charging rich men that they be not high minded, though they enioy much aboue others, that they truſt not in riches, becauſe they are vncertaine, and ſo will deceiue our truſt repoſed on them, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching vs that it is not the vſe but the loue of money, which is the roote of all euill; and therfore becauſe ſom (not al) do luſt after the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they haue erred fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the faith, &amp; ſo do pierce the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues through with many ſorrowes.

For hauing in the 21 verſe,<note place="margin">Coherence.</note> adioyned the doctrine of his particular ſuffering to the former doctrine of his Kingly office in gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and preſeruing his Church, that ſo the wiſe temper of theſe ſeeming contraries might

confound carnall wiſdome, and exerciſe the faith of his diſciples, becauſe the harſh newes of his ſuffering gaue occaſion of offence to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>; as dreaming in his carnall reach, of a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Kingdome; he thereby takes occaſion, from the particular doctrine of his owne ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, to gather a generall concluſion: That whoſoeuer will be his diſciple, muſt alſo deny himſelfe, and take vp his Croſſe and follow him; which bitter pill that it might be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter digeſted, he wiſely remoues the maine bar and hinderance of enduring afflictions; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the loue of life, and that by a ſtrange paradox to the confounding of reaſon, &amp; triall of faith: affirming that the ſauing of life for a time, by auoyding the Croſſe, was the next way to loſe it eternally: and ſo to encourage the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the vndergoing of afflictions, he affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth contrarily, that the enduring of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for his ſake, though it were to the loſſe of life temporall, was the meanes to procure the life eternall, if not alſo for the preſeruation of this preſent life. Now becauſe life were not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable of the carnall man, but for thoſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and profits ſake which the world ſupplies thereto; for otherwiſe theſe fayling, life is but a burden, and death a moſt deſired hauen: therefore the ſpirit of God proceedeth in this verſe to root out of our hearts this loue of the world; and that by propounding the danger that accompanies the ſame; namely, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:19620:8"/>
the pretious ſoule is fearefully enſnared; and endangered. And concludes the folly of ſuch a match, when we pay ſo deere for worldly things, namely, that they profit nothing.</p>

            <p>Secondly, we haue heere the driuing of the Bargaine; namely, this couetous deſire is that which giues way to Satan, to fetch ouer the ſoule.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, heere is the Bargaine it ſelfe; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the ſoule is loſt for the gaining of the world.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, here is the Iudgement and cenſure of the bargaine; namely, that their is no profit in it. Of theſe in their places.</p>

            <p>The reaſons hereof lie couched in the words
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:19620:27"/>
themſelues, which do imply two things. Firſt, a compariſon of the price with the thing bought; the price is amplified, firſt by the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thereof, which is the ſoule. Secondly, by the appropriation, it is our owne, as being our beſt part, yea indeed al in al; that which is the life of our life, that which muſt continue for euer with vs, when theſe things periſh with the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; that which eternally ſhall rue this bargain, when we haue no other benefit thereof.

            <p>Secondly, that when as in other bargaines though we haue loſt at one time,<note place="margin">2 No hope of recouery.</note> yet we may helpe our ſelues in another, yet this loſſe is ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recouerable, becauſe our ſoules once thus loſt can neuer be recouered againe; if Sathan haue once got hold on vs by this bond, we are like neuer to get out againe:<note place="margin">Becauſe the ſoule thus loſt cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered.</note> becauſe it is a bargain made willingly, and with great aduice and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: abuſing religion and conſcience to the driuing thereof, and reiecting all ſence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and common honeſtie for the enioying thereof: what ſacrifice now is left for ſinne, to ſuch that haue thus made a mock of the Sonne of God, and eſteemed baſely of his bloud, in

And therefore let no man deceiue himſelfe with vaine conceits, as if hell would be ſatisfied, or God mocked.<note place="margin">Anſwer to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits.</note> Doth he thinke to winde out of the bargaine by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing the Deuill with this tricke, that his ſoule was not his owne, and therefore he could not ſell that which was none of his? The holy Ghoſt here contradicts him: It is his own ſoule.<note place="margin">It is not our owne. how.</note> Indeede it is not his owne to ſaue the ſame, he muſt be bought with a price, and ſo is not his owne; but yet with this condition, that not as his owne, he may glorifie God therewith in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and ſpirit. To deſtroy and vndoe the ſame, ſo it is his owne, he hath this by inheritance, to be his owne deſtruction; our deſtruction is of our ſelues, &amp; that it may appeare ſo, what God hath decreed, we willingly execute in our conuerſing with the world: we will haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t payment whatſoeuer it coſt vs, &amp; ſo that we may enioy the pleaſures of ſinne for a ſeaſon; we haue no reſpect to that great recompenſe of the reward. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.26.<note place="margin">1 Deceit. hope of doing good with theſe things.</note> Oh but we hope to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe the Bargaine by doing of good herewith.

            <p>But yet withall more confirme the Bargain,<note place="margin">This reiected.</note> in that our doing good to our ſelues, doth but harden the heart the more in ſinne, and lull it in ſecuritie, to expoſe it thereby to ſuddaine ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance: and our well doing to others may bee the vndoing of their ſoules<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or though they fare

            <p>And yet in the meane time there were ſome miſerable comfort vnto worldly men,<note place="margin">2 Reaſons: that the bargaine is naught, but not perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</note> if they could for the preſent enioy their bargaine.

            <p>Eſpecially, their way vttereth their fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſlauerie to Satan; he is not ſo readie to offer, as they to execute: what by deceite in Bargaining, and fraude in ſelling; what by crueltie in oppreſſing, and cunning in vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining; what by engroſſing to themſelues, and encroaching vpon others. He is not wiſe, that hath not a tricke to deceiue the Law, and ſo his owne ſoule.</p>
            <p>Their purpoſe is well knowne to Satan by their words and actions, and ſo hereby he ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bindes them to performance of the Bargain. But now on the other ſide,<note place="margin">Satan per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes not with vs.</note> doth hee performe with them? Nothing leſſe.

If we could be humbled dayly in the ſence of our vnworthyneſſe, how ſhould we be thankfull for the leaſt? How could wee enuie and fret at the proſperity of others? We ſhould now finde too much to doe at home, to haue any leaſure to looke abroad; or if we looke abroad wiſely, it will returne vs home againe, either to examine our ſelues whether we are ſuch, or elſe to be carefull and circumſpect o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer our ſelues that we may not be ſuch. What can we ſee abroad which may not more hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vs vnder the hand of God? and ſhall not
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:19620:31"/>
our abaſing in the preſence of God, be the meanes of our exalting and acceptance with him. And what need wee deſire the wine and the corne, when our God is at peace with vs? Is not he our ſufficient portion, and ſhall we not with him haue all things elſe? Oh, let vs then make ſtill ſure of him, by ſeeking all from him, by renouncing all for him, and vſing all to him; reſting in him onely, and not our ſelues, when we are at greateſt worldly eaſe, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him our refuge when we finde no reſt elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. How ſhall this tryall of our Faith per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the worke by patience, that we may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and entire, wanting nothing, enioying all things, euen when we haue nothing,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 6, 7.</note> and being rich in content, though wee are baſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned of the world? Happy contempt, to keepe vs from the loue thereof, and make vs long the more after heauen; yea moſt happy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſing of man, that caſts vs vpon our God, to haue experience of his fauour, and euerlaſting compaſſions. Let them make the wedge of golde their hope, that haue no repoſe in God; and let their glory be their ſhame, whoſe belly is their God.</p>
            <p>Let them take their fill of dalliance, till a dart be ſtrucke through their Liuer; and let them be contented with the leproſie, that will needs run after the talents of deceit. Miſerable foole, that will be thus led to the ſtockes, and as an Oxe to the ſhambles; wretched <hi>Gehezi</hi> that to receiue
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:19620:32"/>
that which his Maiſter refuſed, partakes of that plague which his Maiſter cured.</p>
            <p>To conclude all, a Bargaine you ſee is a bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and our vnſatiable hearts driue the ſame. A match is made vp, and we ſee the danger of it: wee are deceiued therein, and yet cannot helpe our ſelues. Let vs therefore bee wiſe to ſet bounds to our reſtleſſe deſires, and let vs turne the currant contrary, that ſo wee may wade ſafely and enioy our endeauours; vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py they, that ſo deſire, as that they can be ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner wearied, then ſatisfied with their labours. Miſerable men that ſeeke for happineſſe in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vanitie and changeableneſſe, and can finde this their onely content to be reſtleſſe in the purſuit of what they cannot compaſſe; or what they compaſſe, increaſeth their miſerie: moſt deſperate their eſtate that haue no hope but in this life, wherein (notwithſtanding) they are iuſtly deceiued and confounded. Oh then, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py they that haue the God of gods for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, who ſweetens vnto them all their bitter pilles, and hereby preuents ſurfaiting of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exceſſe: happy they that haue their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſet vpon heauenly things, which can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be taken from them, though they are from them; and ſo being from them doe encreaſe their ſpirituall appetite, that ſo they may neuer ceaſe longing, till they be ſatisfyed with him. Oh happy are they that can be contented with their eſtates! becauſe what the Lord diſpoſeth
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:19620:32"/>
is beſt and fitteſt for them; and yet by faith can ſtill be reſtleſſe after what is promiſed: that ſo God may fulfill the deſires of them that feare him. Yea they are happy, and euer more bleſſed are they that vſe the world as ſtrangers and as ſtrangers are entertained thereof; that ſo they may approue themſelues to belong to another countrey, and may haſten to that Countrie and Citie which is aboue. This happineſſe of the way, he which is the Way grant vnto vs, euen for his trueth ſake; that ſo by him we may be conducted to the happineſſe of our Countrey. To whom with God the Father, and the bleſſed Spirit, three glorious Perſons and one God in vnitie, might and maieſty be aſcribed of vs and all Saints, as it is moſt due; all glory, power, dominion, and thankſgiuing, with all feare and obedience, both now and for euer. Amen.</p>

               <p>THus haſt thou gentle <hi>Reader</hi> a Briefe of ſuch Meditations, which by obſeruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly courſes I haue conceiued, concerning the deſperate eſtate of Worldlings, endangering their ſoules for the gayning of worldly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities. And for thy further ſatisfaction herein, that thou mayeſt preuent deceit in thy Chriſtian libertie, leſt it be an occaſion to the fleſh; and follow thy earthly plough ſo that the better Plough ſtill goe forward, I haue thought
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:19620:33"/>
it neceſſarie to adioyne hereunto certaine Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Conſcience, whereby thou mayeſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued in ſuch difficulties, and ſeeming contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions as appeare betweene thy generall and ciuill calling; that ſo thou mayeſt wiſely ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate the one vnto the other: and make thy ciuill calling, a furtherance to the perfection of thy generall. To this end, ſeeing, as the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the Sabboath is a ſpeciall tryall and furtherance of ſynceritie in all other occaſion; ſo the maine quarrell of Worldlings is againſt the ſame: either they would vtterly aboliſh the ſame that it may not be kept at all, or elſe they would delude and fruſtrate the power thereof vnder pretence of Chriſtian libertie. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Quaere. </seg>1</label> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the firſt Quaere, ſhal be concerning the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie which the Sabboath allowes.</p>
               <p>What vſe of our ciuill callings, and other accedents thereto, may bee allowed vpon the Lords day.</p>
               <p>To which we anſwer briefly, that ſuch liberty hereto is onely allowed herein, as the word and equitie therof doth confine vnto vs. Namely.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That in caſe of neceſſitie for the preſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of life, ſo that without preſent helpe it may be certainly endangered, wee may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully exerciſe our ciuill callings, but neither in the ſame manner as at other times, or to the ſame ends. Firſt, I ſay,</p>
               <p>Not in the ſame manner, that is; not with the ſame intention of the minde, which on this
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:19620:33"/>
day muſt be more abſtracted from earthly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, then another day: not ſo much our loue to the perſon, as our loue vnto God, muſt now beare ſway in doing the thing with an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire reſpect to God commanding the ſame, that he may haue the glory of our ſimple obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that man may receiue benefit ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by: which though I acknowledge is to guide vs at all times, yet ſpecially the Saboth requires this retired obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. And in our releeuing the perſon, though his body or ſtate be in preſent danger, yet our principall ayme muſt be the reliefe of the ſoule by exhortation, reproof, &amp;c. as occaſion ſerues: and that without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of refreſhing the minde of body by any ſuch labour, which is lawfull at other times.</p>
               <p>Thus is the different manner in regard of the minde; and ſo alſo there muſt be a difference in the vſe of the body: as ſo to exerciſe the body as ſpecially to humble and abaſe it by the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of our labour; whereas at other times wee may more reſpect the eaſe thereof.</p>
               <p>And yet ſo farre onely to exerciſe it as not to tire &amp; weary it, if vrgent occaſion do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, leſt weariſomeneſſe require ſome ſuch recreation thereof as is nor meete.</p>
               <p>And if any vrgent occaſion may bring wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſomenes, yet now in ſteed of ſuch bodily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation, the minde may be enlarged to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly meditations and thankeſgiuing, thereby to refreſh the wearied carcaſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:19620:34"/>Whence it followeth that all bodily recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that do not further vs to diuine worſhip, are vnlawfull on the Lords day: Becauſe they ſerue onely to refreſh the body after labour; which is reſtrained therefro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; otherwiſe I ſay, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſhal make vs fitter to ſerue God, when we haue any liberty to labour vpon caſe of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, though we may vſe that liberty to weariſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, yet this is to be releeued ſpecially with ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall recreation.</p>
               <p n="2">2 This inferreth that the vſe of our Ciuil cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings on this day, is not as they are Ciuill, but rather as they are abſtracted from all Ciuill reſpects.</p>
               <p>And this ſhall appeare the better, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the different Ends of imployment on this day from the other.</p>
               <p>Our End on ordinary dayes, may be bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to our ſelues, for the encreaſe of our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward meanes and maintenance in the world; ſo may we not do on the Lords day. Here wee muſt labour freely without hire or fee, our paines muſt be a free will offering without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of recompence, to approue the ſincerity of our obedience, wholy for Gods ſake, and not our owne.</p>
               <p>And that our labour muſt now be ſeuered from al reſpect or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentment of the body, but rather to the humiliation both of ſoule and body. The like muſt be reſolued concerning ſuch other workes as are allowed this day. As.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:19620:34"/>2. Workes of Charitie, which though they may now bee performed, (as relieuing the poore, viſiting the ſicke and afflicted) yet here they muſt be limited by the former circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, as after a diuers Nature and to diuers Endes then at other times.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Now they are to be performed more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally then at other times, in regard of the matter we giue; becauſe this day requires a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayning of our ſelues herein, that we may be more enlarged to others; both in that our leſſe bodily labour hath need thereof; and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter labour of the mind, requires the leſſe, leſt it be hindred and dulled hereby. And yet in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the manner, they are to be performed more ſparingly: leſſe time beſtowed thereon, leſſe wearying of the body; and all this that both bodie and ſoule may bee more free and ready in the worſhip of God.</p>
               <p>The like may be concluded of that other bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily worke allowed on the Sabboath; namely, the view of the creature: Now the minde muſt be abſtracted from all delight in them, as they ſerue for preſent vſe, which may be allowed at other times; and onely inflamed hereby to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God, in the wonderfull varietie and vſe of them, for the aduancement of his power and prouidence in their creation and gouernment, without any reſpect of right or vſe of them to our ſelues.</p>
               <p>Whence it followeth?</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:19620:35"/>1. That all liberall vſe of the Creatures in prodigall Feaſting, &amp;c, is now forbidden, but onely ſuch as may ſerue neceſſitie, and bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable vnto good reaſon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Generally no other bodily labour is now admitted, but what is confined within the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer bounds of neceſſitie and charitie, and the like, together with ſuch other circumſtances of different manner and end, as before are laid downe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And thus of the firſt Caſe and Reſolution thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Caſe. </seg>2</label> A ſecond caſe ariſeth; That ſeeing the Lord hath ſet apart but one day for his Seruice, and left vs ſixe for our ciuill callings: Whether it be not lawfull to ſpend more time in following the world, then ſeeking after heauen? And ſo whether though our thoughts runne more vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on preſent occaſions of this life, then vpon thoſe of a better, we may not yet haue comfort that our eſtate is ſecure, our intereſt good in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall happineſſe.</p>
               <p>The Reſolution hereof conſiſts, Firſt, in the Conſideration of the right vſe and intent of the Sabboath, which is principally to confine and employ our thoughts wholie vpon heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things and ſuch occaſions, as that day are publikely offered to further the ſame, and that for two ends. One, that this heauenly employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our thoughts on this day, and ſo of our words and actions ſutable thereto, may be both a reſemblance of our pure and perfect eſtate in
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:19620:35"/>
heauen, when all our thoughts, words and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhall be thus wholy exerciſed, and alſo on euidence of our right in that happineſſe, and withall may prouoke vs to ſigh and haſten to that perfect eſtate; by how much our experience of fayling in theſe things on this day argues our ſhortnes and aberration from that perfection.</p>
               <p>And hereupon followes another vſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the Sabboath; Namely, that by reſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and ſetting our thoughts now onely vpon heauen, he obiects wee may at all other times keepe them better in order, that though they may haue libertie on the other dayes to world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly occaſions: yet by the former imployment of them on the Sabboath, they may now be ſo bridled and ſeaſoned with holy grounds and Spirituall ends: as that we may ſo vſe the world as if we vſed it not, our hearts may not bee ſet vpon the ſame, though we muſt conuerſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with: but both lifted vp to God for the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of our buſineſſe, and kept ſtill euer with God in the proſecuting thereof, and ſo returne vnto God for the bleſſing of the ſame, and relie again vpon God in waiting on his prouidence, and meditating of the heauenly riches: making ſtill theſe worldly occaſions daily matter to humble vs hereby, in that we cannot be without what in ſome ſort hinders our intire fellowſhip with God: to exerciſe our Faith and patience; in that our labour is nothing without the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God: to try our ſynceritie, that we can
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:19620:36"/>
ſpare time for heauenly occaſions, and ſeaſon our earthly affaires with Spirituall Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And ſo to prepare vs by a daily viewing of our reckonings, and making euen with God, to our great account; and ſo hereby to ſit vs the better to the next Sabboath, and ſo to prouoke vs to hunger after the eternall Sabboath.</p>
               <p>Thus doth the right vſe and entent of the Sabboath extend to the holy ordering of our ciuill Callings.</p>
               <p>And ſurely if we conſider rightly in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place, the right vſe and ende of our ciuill Callings. Which is not ſo much for preſent maintenance of life, or to thriue thereby, as to humble vs vnder the mightie hand of God, in that we haue need of ſuch meanes, which, had not ſinne entred into the world, we ſhould not haue had; and ſo daily to renew repentance and thereby to prouoke to loue and compaſſion towards others; that ſo we may lay vp a good foundation againſt the life to come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The wiſe conſideration and comparing of both theſe together; both the right vſe and ende of the Sabboath and our ciuill Callings, will happily further the reſolution of theſe doubts, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the Conſcience, in any ſcruples that may ariſe there-from.</p>
               <p>For out of this compariſon will ariſe theſe concluſions. Firſt though the Lord hath allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vs ſixe dayes for our ciuill Callings, and but one for the generall, yet from this: proportion
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:19620:36"/>
it doth not follow, that though more time be allowed for our worldly occaſions then for our ſpirituall, therefore wee may enlarge our thoughts ſo much the more after worldly things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then after thoſe of a better life: ſeeing as our ciuill Callings are ordained, not ſo much for the maintenance of this preſent, as that life which is to come; ſo our managing of them muſt bee Spirituall, with thoughts and actions deriued from that Fountaine, guided by the ſame Rule, and ayming at the ſame End.</p>
               <p>And therefore as the Sabboath doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine vs altogether from theſe carnall world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoughts, as being ſimply euill on that day: ſo neither doe the other dayes otherwiſe allow them, then as they proceed from a ſpirituall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to glorifie God in obedience to him in our Calling, rather then to enrich our ſelues, and ſo ayme at a Spirituall end, euen the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of vs to a better life.</p>
               <p>The Summe of all is:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Our ciuill Callings one the Lords day muſt wholly ceaſe, but vpon the former oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions.</p>
               <p n="2">2. On the weeke dayes they muſt be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not with worldly but with heauenly minds. They muſt be begun with Prayer, both priuate, and if it may be, with the Familie: they muſt be continued with ſpirituall Meditations, tending to weane vs from the loue of them; by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the manifold diſtractions, the baſenes,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:19620:37"/>
and corruption incident thereto, and ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoking to raiſe vp the minde to heauenly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects; and they muſt bee ended with content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and thankefulneſſe, with prayer, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſubmitting to the will of God, and waiting by Faith his glorious Bleſſing.</p>
               <p>Thus if we doe, our thoughts (though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſant with the world, yet) ſhall haue ſweet commerce with heauen; our time, though more dayes ſpent in our ciuil Callings, yet now thus employed, ſhall ſanctifie them vnto vs, and ſanctifie vs more and more by them, and ſo make euery day a ſpirituall Sabboath. Thus we ſhall walke with God, while we haue dealing in the world, &amp; haue our conuerſation in heauen, while wee are thus ſtrangers on the earth: Our thoughts though imployed vpon the world, yet ſhall not reſt thereon, but retire againe to their true Center of heauen; and our wayes, though trauailing in the world, yet ſhall ſtil be ayming and haſtening to our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try which is aboue. So that, though we liue in the fleſh, we ſhall not liue after the fleſh: and though we may take care for the fleſh, yet wee ſhall not care to ſatisfie the ſame, nor vſe our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie as occaſion thereto. In a word, we ſhall hereby ſo vſe the world, as that we may not loue it; we ſhall ſo deſire to liue, and ſeeke meanes for the maintenance thereof; as that ſtill wee ſhall bee ready to die, and to leaue all for Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:19620:37"/>And this may ſerue for anſwere to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Queſtion.</p>
               <p>Hence ariſeth a third ſcruple: Whether it be not lawfull to deſire riches and aboundance.</p>
               <p>To which we anſwere: 1. By a diſtinction of riches, which may be conſidered: As they are neceſſary and ſufficient, and ſo a ſmall thing may be counted riches, as contenting Nature and being ſufficient for vs. 2. They may be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as they are in the eſtimation of the world, and in their own Nature, and ſo aboundance is to be deemed riches, &amp; ſo they are vnneceſſary.</p>
               <p>A 2. Difference, now to be conſidered, is of the perſons which may deſire them, which are of two ſorts. Firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> publike<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſuch whoſe Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings cannot be well executed without aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, as that of the Magiſtrate, and ſuch other publike Callings. Secondly, ſome perſons are priuate, and theſe alſo in regard of their charge and ſuch like occaſions, may lawfully deſire more or leſſe.</p>
               <p>A 3. Difference is in reſpect of our deſires, which are either abſolute, ſuch as require ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the performance of what we deſire; ſuch as are all deſires for Spirituall graces, which for the grace ſimply muſt be abſolute, though for the meaſure thereof they may be conditionall:</p>
               <p n="2">2. Our deſires are conditionall, with ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection to Gods will, as may make moſt for his glorie and our good; and ſo ought all our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires be for earthly things: becauſe that God
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:19620:38"/>
hath ſo onely promiſed them, as they ſhalbe for our good. And ſo muſt we onely deſire them. Out of theſe diſtinctions ariſe theſe concluſions.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Firſt we may generally deſire riches, as they are in the firſt ſence neceſſary and ſufficient, not as they are leſſe neceſſary &amp; aboundant. <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 28. <hi>Deuter.</hi> 17.16.17. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.8.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Secondly, we may deſire what may aſwell fit our callings as perſons; though this may be ſatisfyed with leſſe, yet the calling may deſire more, and ſo ſuch callings as require ſtate and maieſtie, may require abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dance: yet ſo as that,</p>
               <p n="3">3 All our deſires for theſe things muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional, ſubmitting to Gods pleaſure, both for the thing, as alſo for the meanes to obtaine the ſame; and ſo for the meaſure and continuance thereof vnto vs, and ſo not enlarged by our owne couetous minde, but confined to the iudgement and example of the moſt ſober and frugall perſons. And therefore,</p>
               <p n="4">4 All our deſires for theſe things muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with prayers vnto God, both for the thing we deſire, as alſo for the meaſure and bleſſing thereon.</p>
               <p>Thus may we lawfully deſire Riches.</p>

Eſpecially, ſeeing it fals out that ſome Callings may haue for the moſt their ground from cuſtome and vanity, and not from conſcience; as generally of tyring, and ſuch like, and tend to the ſatisfying of the fleſh; I ſee not but in ſuch Caſes, it is not only lawfull but neceſſarie euen to change our Callings, leſt otherwiſe wee make ſhip-wracke of good conſcience, and defraud our ſelues of that liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie which God and Nature allowes, and limit the prouidence of God to our meanes, which extends it ſelfe to all lawfull. Prouided that ſtill we keepe the diſtinction betweene Authoritie and ſubiection; remembring that wee may ſo change our Callings, as ſtill to keepe our ſelues within the compaſſe of our generall bounds, which are, ſtill to be ſubiect to gouernment, and ſo onely vnto them, as to ſerue them in the Lord. Not encroaching vpon the Calling of

                  <hi>Whether one man may haue diuers Callings?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As, the Miniſter may be alſo a Magiſtrate?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>One Trades-man may exerciſe diuers ciuill Callings?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the former we anſwer generally, that where Callings are ſubordinate to each other, there in caſe of neceſſitie, one may ſupply diuers Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, as his abilitie is thereto: ſo the Miniſter may in ſome Caſes and degrees, execute the office of a Magiſtrate.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Magiſtrates are of two ſorts: 1. ſupreame, and ſoueraigne, as the King: and 2. Inferior and ſubordinate, as ſuch as are appointed vnder him, for the eaſing of his burthen, and better ſeruing the publike good: ſo a Miniſter may be a Magiſtrate, though he may not encroach vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſupreame authoritie. I ſay hee may not vſurpe ſoueraigne Gouernment; becauſe this is a marke of Antichriſt, 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.9, 10. This is contrary to the Word, which commands all both Prieſts and people, to be ſubiect to the higher Powers. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1. This cannot be for the preſeruation of the common Peace, which is by Vnitie, and Reformation of all abuſes which tend to the diſturbance thereof. And how ſhall the faults of Miniſters bee corrected
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:19620:42"/>
but by the ſupreame Magiſtrate? how ſhall their wrongs be righted but by him?</p>
               <p>Yet I hold that a Miniſter may be an inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Gouernour; becauſe it is lawfull for the Magiſtrate to beſtow honour and authoritie, as it pleaſeth him for the publike good.</p>
               <p>And this authoritie giuen to the Miniſterie, may tend to the publike good; and the glory of God, as hereby,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Their Perſons may be better accepted, and preſerued from contempt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Their Callings be executed more cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly, when they haue ſome power to reſtraine open and groſſe euils, and compell the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man to conformation in Religion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Their conſtancie and courage herein, as it may eaſe of a burthen, ſo it may confirme and encourage the ſupreame Magiſtrate in the loue and maintenance of the Trueth: ſo that ſtill the holy Order of ſubiection bee kept, that all this bee done with direction from the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame Power, and returne thereto: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion be auoyded; that we ſo execute theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall Callings, as that ſtill we reſerue a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction betweene them, and oppoſe not thoſe things, which are wiſely to bee ſubordinated, which we may doe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If we conſider that there are ſome ſpeciall actions particular to each Callings, which on either ſide may not be encroached vpon. As, the Magiſtrate may not preach, miniſter the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:19620:42"/>
Sacraments, &amp;c, becauſe this is peculiar to the Miniſter. So the Miniſter (I meane as a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter) may not preſcribe Lawes, execute the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties of them, Determine of the perſons, and goods of the ſubiect, &amp;c, becauſe theſe are the Magiſtrates Prerogatiue.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That all things bee done with direction from the royall Canon, &amp; ayme at Gods glory.</p>
               <p n="3">3. So is it in the reformed Churches, where the Conſiſtorie doth as well medle in Ciuill, as Eccleſiaſticall occaſions. And is it any other in our Honourable Court of the High Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and in other Conſiſtories of our Clergie?</p>
               <p>As for the other; That one man may exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe diuers ciuill Callings: As this is apparent by the practiſe of our Land, where ſome Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants euer vſe other Trades: Mercers abroad ſell things belonging to many Trades; ſo I ſee not but that it may be warrantable by the word, which ſo enioyneth vs to be contented with the Calling that God hath placed vs in; as the ſeruant, while he is a ſeruant, is not to encroach vpon the Calling of the Maiſter; as that it deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, but when we are for our ſelues, we may follow what Calling we pleaſe, though we bee not bound thereto; ſo wee haue skill therein, and reſpect the publike good, hinder not ou<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
