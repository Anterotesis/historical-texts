         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

(most Gracious Sir) be pleased to use a while these
my poore endeavours, till those more worthie show
themselves to the world. And looke not on the harsh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of my stile, but bend Your high and generous
thoughts upon the actions, truly Roman, that's to say,
Noble, High, Heroik, Great, and farre transcending
meane and vulgar spirits. And, if You wil impute (as

and no wayes, to my Patterns Genius, I dare
boldly undertake, that your <hi>Montrose</hi> shall prove
neither unpleasant, nor unprofitable.</p>
            <p>For, what can be more pleasant to a Prince, second
to none on earth, but his Father, borne in that emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
dignitie, bred in that condition, and from his
infancie trained up in those wayes, which resent no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Heroicall deeds; then to have alwayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his eyes, that worthie, whom (be it said without
envy) no man in his time goeth beyond, to embrace,
caresse and cherish him, and coppie out his actions,
and observe,

                  <l>How he behaves himself, how brave and goodlie,</l>
                  <l>In Martiall feats, manhood and Chevalrie?</l>
               </q>
Who taking up arms to serve the commands of the best
of Kings, your most Gracious Father, and leading the
dance, as it were, to usher in Your Valour, which now
waxeth to ripnes and strength apace; hath performed
such exploits, as strikes the present times with admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
and gratefull posteritie shal ever preserve in
memorie. For, though envy presse hard upon true
glorie, and tread upon her heels; yet that short lived,
and self destroying furie, shall never overtake, nor
ecclipse her solid and immortall lustre.</p>
            <p>In the meane time (most Gracious Sir) we present
You here with no smoothe fables, or Romanses.</p>

               <l>Swallowing Charybdis, devouring Polypheme.</l>
            </q>
            <p>No gyants, or glorious wonders; yet enemies, as
like gyants, and Victories obtained over them, as
like wonders, as may be. For, what did ever lying
Greece faine of the proud attempts of their old gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants,
which these conspiratours, the sons of the earth,
have not dared to doe against God, religion,
faith, loyaltie, and right, in all their dealings, with
Your Royall Parents, Your self, and all Yours? who
heaping up mo intains, upon mountains of lyes, calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
<pb facs="tcp:33308:4"/>
and slanders; reared up those bulworkes, from
whence, with horrid violence, they have fought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Gods. And what did they imagine done
by <hi>Apollo,</hi> by <hi>Pallas,</hi> or <hi>Mars,</hi> to overthrow those
monsters; which our <hi>Montrose</hi> did not with like cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
undertake, and successe performe? And now that
having vanquished, he did not finally, and totally
triumph over them; we must impute it to the force of
Your Fate, which would not permit the Genius of
Your countrey, to owe so glorious a deliverance, to
any others valour, but Your own. Nor indeed, seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it convenient, that any other should thunder
downe <hi>Enceladus,</hi> with those other Titans, to Hell; but
the sonne of him, whose father those gyants kept in
chains.</p>
            <p>And then (Great Sir) when You intend those
courses, to which the lawes of God, and man oblidge
You; the vindication of Your Father, and countrey,
from that most savage bondage; what can be more
profitable, then to have Your eyes stil on him, as the
guide, and leader of Your way, who first of all disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
the counsells, plots, and treacheries of these
traitors, and, as I may say, alone did show the way,
how to lay their intollerable pride, and breake their
power, though growen verie great, before it was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.
<pb facs="tcp:33308:5"/>
For You shall find him a body, without a
soul; for being no more valiant in arms then wise
in counsell and managing affairs, he advised <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>mous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
(and would to God his counsell had prevailed)
to strangle that monster in the cradle, aswell as when
it was growen strong, he had crusht it, but that Your
growing vertue, was not to be defrauded, of so large
a field, for purchasing renowne. So that besides his
singular valour, and militarie skill, You may find in
him choise instructions of civil prudence, and politik
wisedome; which though (through the sad fatalitie
of the times) they were but ill believed, yet such as
may perhaps be usefull to Your self, and after ages.
And this is seene clearly, in that advise, to prevent
betimes, the purposes and practises of these traitors,
who had built their hopes upon the sweet disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our most Gracious King. His clemencie to wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedst
rebells, his trust in unworthie persons, his boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
to ingrate men (for such most of them proved)
and great compassion on all; more then on anie
strength, or power of their own: and to compasse, and
quell them, by the force of just armes (since they had
left no other way) before their forces, with too long
delay, should bulk, and grow too puissant and great.
And if but this had beene put in execution (to say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb facs="tcp:33308:5"/>
of what else befell us) our Britaine had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
become the bloodie stage of this unnaturall war;
the glorious Temples of our Lord had never beene so
vilely, so wickedly prophaned; our streets had never
so swame with the innocent blood of our best No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
and Churchmen; Your Royal Father, and Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
had never beene detained in so unworthie
bonds; Your Gracious Mother as a widow, and
Your self, as a banished exile, had never beene for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to live beyond seas; though in an hospitable, and
friendly, yet strange and forreigne land.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Who is't, that can such stories tell,</l>
               <l>And his dry eies, with tears not swel?</l>
            </q>
            <p>And seing in al these exploits (even above envy it
self illustrious) the Almightie most evidently kithed
his own immediat hand; so that to God alone the
whole and solid glory is duly to be rendred: yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
who can but acknowledge, honour, admire, love,
and set forth his worth, whom that Great God
thought good to depute his instrument of so glorious
atchievments? For, had our <hi>Montrose</hi> beene only to
graple with open enemies in the fields, perhaps these
might seem matters of lesser moment: That he was
never pursued, with lesse then two, somtimes three
armies at once, in the front, the rear, and flank; and
<pb facs="tcp:33308:6"/>
the least of those, for number of souldiers, choice of
weapons, and abundance of all warlike provision,
farre exceeding all the forces that he could gather; yet
did he still free himself of them all, with equall reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
and successe: That, he had never other Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zin
of arms, powder, shotte, or instruments of warre,
but what by force he tooke from his conquered ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:
That, in the space of one yeare, he obtained six
compleat victories, in sett battells in the fields; and
chased the conspiring Lords quite out of all Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:
That he endured the winter, in a most bitter
frostie cold countrie and Climate, without Garrison,
without tent, or hutte, or boothe; for most part under
the open Canopy of Heaven: That dry, he quenched
his thrist with cold water, and that such, as from the
melting snow came dropping down these mountains:
That, without bread, or salt, with beife alone, and
that often scarse, stale, and leane, he sustained hunger;
and all such other inconveniencies of warre.</p>
            <p>But his master-piece, and hardest taske was, to
wrestle with those, who would seeme the sharpest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengers
of the wrongs done to the King; and patrons
of Majestie: with some of their dull, heavie, and stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid
sloth; others intolerable pride, some of their base
couwardise, others their sordid avarice, some of their
<pb facs="tcp:33308:6"/>
horrible perfidiousnes. So that had not his constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
and courage been undanted; and that loyall flame
of zeale, which in his heart did burne towards
his dearest, and most dread Soveraigne, beene un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quencheable;
he had never been able to bear out, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure,
resist, and rectifie all those severall unruly pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
and humors of men. For, by severe laws of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarie
discipline, or other punishments (as Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
in chiefe are wont) <hi>Montrose</hi> neither ought,
nor could restraine his souldiers; who received no pay;
but took up armes freely, of meere loyaltie to their
King, and goodwill to him their Generall: and who
could easily have turned to the rebells side, so soone
as ever they had but seemed to themselves to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
by the sleightest injurie, or branded with the
least note of disgrace<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> men, for the most part, head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strong,
turbulent, factious, and readie to revolt, upon
the meanest irritation and pette. So that to preserve,
at once his own authoritie, with the good liking of
his souldiers, was the most difficult taske in the
world. Nor was there any thing that more violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
exercised his wit and judgement, then that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooved
him to square out his counsells and actions,
to the measure of other mens capacities, or at least,
seeme so to doe. But he, that he might advance the
<pb facs="tcp:33308:7"/>
Kings service, made no account of, and despised, as
things farre under him, all the hatred of his enemies,
the envy of his emulous rivalls, the back-byting of
Court-sycophants, the complaints of his friends, the
reproaches of the people, and (which was of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
most terrible, and most affrighted the supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
minds of the simple multitude) all the execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
and anathemaes of their fierie and furious Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
Verilie, He, a Generall worthie of a nobler
command, and more happie times then these.</p>
            <p>And now (most Excellent Prince) this same Your
<hi>Montrose,</hi> will plainly show that which I hope will
most of all conduce to Your affairs: That all Your
Scots have never made defection fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> their most Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Lord and King. Which, while some unjust ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of our good name, too bitterly, and malitiously
strive to rubbe upon us; they are no more undeserved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
injurious to us; then indeed unfaithful, and treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous
to Your Royall Father, and Your self. Because,
they goe about only to render Your best and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stest
friends, servants, and subjects suspected, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious,
and consequently uselesse unto You, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable:
of whose loyaltie, and valour, they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
(the worst of evill counsellours) have just cause
to be jealous; least by their means, it be brought to
<pb facs="tcp:33308:7"/>
passe, that one day they may receive the just punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their treacheries. But, let no man unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upbraid us, that this reflects upon the most renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
nation of the English, as if we did neither think,
nor speak aright of them: which is a crime that we
abhorre from our very souls. And to the contrary we
doe confesse, applaud, magnifie, and congratulate to
their immortall glorie, that many worthies of that
nation have showne themselves most loyall, brave
and gallant, and done rare, and glorious deeds for
their King. Only this we entreat for, that with the
same ingeniousnes, and candour they would deal
with us; and not lay the guiltines of any one faction,
though never so powerfull and prevailing, to the
charge of the whole nation: nor do to others what
they would not have done to themselves. Neither let
them deny, but that there are, and have been Scots<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
eminent personages, of everie degree, and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
who in these most disastruous times, have been
readie and willing to shedde their dearest blood, for
asserting and vindicating the Royall Majestie, from
the combinations of most pernicious rebells in both
Kingdomes.</p>
            <p>And this is so evident, and cleare; that these Scots
may (without all boasting) boldly affirme, That they,
<pb facs="tcp:33308:8"/>
being hired with no pay, nor expecting other reward;
but meerly moved by a good conscience, and faith,
and pietie towards their most Gracious Soveraigne;
have suffered for him greater losse, according to the
condition of their fortunes, and done the rebells grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
harm, and obtained more noble victories over
them, then others; who, having drained and exausted
the Kings Exchequer, reduced him to that extream
penury, &amp; want of al things, that in the end he was
necessitated, to render up his Sacred Person into the
hands of the conspiratours. But, Ã´ how much better
had it been (in our weak judgments) if it had pleased
God, that his Majestie had retired himself to his own
Scots: not those, who then were armed against him, for
the English rebells; out these loyall, trusty, faithful,
and valiant ones, who fought for him under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of <hi>Montrose.</hi> Assuredly, to those, who under the
command but of his Lieutenant, and Leader of his
Armies, durst so gallantly attempt, and did so hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilie
atcheive, what in this book we have most faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
recorded, nothing could have appeared too ardu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and difficult to compasse, had they been encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged,
and animated with the presence of so dear a
pledge. Nor can any doubt, unlesse he be altogether
ignorant of the Scottish affairs, but that, if his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie
<pb facs="tcp:33308:8"/>
had come among them, he would have easily
drawn to his party, the hearts and affections of his
native subjects; who wholly enclined to him, of their
own accord. But this being too to well known to the
leaders of the rebellion, their speciall care was, that
he should find no entrance to his native countrie,
when he was in their hands, not fourtie miles distant
from the borders of it.</p>
            <p>And truly the Scots in generall, though (cheifly
at that time) sorely opprest with the heavie yoke of
those usurping tyrants; yet were they not afraid to
curse, with bitter maledictions, the authours, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betters
of that shamefull deed, of delivering up their
King to the hands of the English. And even
those, who formerly went along with the conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours,
in all things else, did openly, and not without
danger of life, talke thus aloud: That, the single King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Scotland, had of old sufficed his Majesties
ancestours, to mantain their just rights, and Royall
dignities: That their own forefathers had been suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
able, to defend and fight for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, against their
fiercest enemies, cheifly the English, of whom they had
purchased manie, great, and glorious triumphs, while
they opposed them for their Kings. That, though
they had warred often and long with sundries, as
<pb facs="tcp:33308:9"/>
well inhabitants of the same Island, as of other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys,
with various successe of uncertain warre;
yet could they never be reducted to those straights, so
sleightly, and as it were perforce, to deliver up their
Kings to the arbitriment of others. And that they
should not now consent to doe it the verie ghosts of
their fathers (they said) the most sacred name, and
Majestie of a King, their faith, alleagiance, loyaltie,
reputation among stangers, example to be derived to
posteritie, all right, all lawes of God and man did
withstand. And moreover (they added) that it did
plainly contradict, and fight against their own verie
covenant; wherein they had invoked, as both witnes
and judge the immortal God, <hi>that they would main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
and defend their King, the safetie of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
his dignitie, crowne, and greatnes, against all
men living, with their lives and fortunes to their
last breath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that, beside those seditious and sacrilegious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
(who first raised that armie by wicked means,
and then got the command of it in their own hands,
and with the dreadful terrour therof overawed their
poor countreymen, unarmed, unprovided for warre,
without any head, or cheistaine) beleeve it, most of
all the Scots, desire no greater happines then an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
<pb facs="tcp:33308:9"/>
to testifie their fidelitie, obedience, and love
to their drearest King, and to seal it with their blood.
Nor is it to be questioned, but that they, being now
so trampled on by most barbarous tyrannie, would
gladly return to their wonted subjection, under the
just and easie government of their most Gracious
Lord and King: so soone as ever Your Royall Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
most wished for presence, or Your own shall
appeare or shine in their Horrizon, like a blessed
starre, or influence from heaven.</p>
            <p>It behoveth You then (most Gracious Sir) to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
all the power and force You can, of body and
mind, to succour Your countrey, and Father, both
in extream danger at this instant. All, to this end,
pray, implore, expect Your help; and promise theirs.
This undertaking, by the law of God, and nature, and
prerogative of birth, belongs unto You: and the eyes
and thoughts, not only of Your owne, but of all the
world are upon You. And all men of honour, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestie,
heartily desire, that by Gods help, and with
their best wishes, and assistance, You may goe about
this glorious enterprise, of restoring the Church of
God, now sunck, and drowned in the stinking puddle
of so manie vile, and odious sects, to her former lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
and puritie; of re-establishing Your Fathers
<pb facs="tcp:33308:10"/>
throne and Kingdome; of recovering Your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyes
wonted felicite, and happie conclusion of all,
in a solid, lasting, and much desired order and peace.
And so, in a good time, may that most ancient
Kingdom of Europe, acknowledge, fear, love, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore
You, as their only highest Lord, and Soveraign:
and so may this happines befal from time, to time,
world without end.</p>

vouchsafe to raise up Your <hi>Montrose</hi> in Your

            <head>To the Courteous READER.</head>
            <p>THer be some few things (courteous Reader) wherewith
I would have them acquainted, who shal come to reade
this breife Commentarie: whereof, some concerne the
Lord Marquis of <hi>Montrose</hi> himself, whose actions at
home, in his native Countrey, by the space of two yeares, are
heirin described; and others, the Authour of this worke. And
first, I would have thee understand that <hi>Montrose</hi> is the Cheife
of the <hi>Graemis,</hi> a most auntient, &amp; renowned family in <hi>Scotland;</hi>
and that in the language of the auntient Scots, He is called <hi>Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me</hi>
the Greate. He deryues the first known source of his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>degree,
from that most famous <hi>Graeme,</hi> so often, and so honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
mentioned, in the monuments of that Kingdome; father in
Law to <hi>Ferguse</hi> the second of that name. Who first, under the
command of his Sonne in Law the King, overcame the <hi>Romans,</hi>
and overthrew <hi>Severus</hi> Wall, the furthermost border of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Empire; built all along from Forth, where it is navigable,
to the mouthe of the River Clyde, where the Isle of Greate
Britaine is narrowest; and so closed up the Roman Province
in straiter bounds. Whence it comes to passe, that the ruins
of that Wall, yet evidently appearing, beares his name to this
day; and by the neighbouring inhabitants, is called <hi>Graemsdijke.</hi>
And this same founder of that Noble race, after the death of
his Sonne in Law King <hi>Ferguse,</hi> being declared Administrator
of the Kingdome, and appointed Governour to the young King
his grandchilde; was no lesse famous, for his peaceable Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
then exploits of warre. For having recalled, and brought
home againe the Doctors, and Professors of the Christian faith,
banished by late persecution &amp; warre, to their native Countrey,
&amp; settled aswel the Church as Kingdome with wholesome Laws;
of his own free accord, gave up the Government to his
Grand-child, now grown to some ripenes o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> yeares. He lived in
the dayes of <hi>Honorius</hi> and <hi>Arcadius</hi> Emperours, about the yeare of
<pb facs="tcp:33308:11"/>
our Lord 400. from whose loynes sprang a long &amp; flowrishin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>
greate Grandfathers Vertues, grew famous in the following
generations.</p>
            <p>Among these, that valiant <hi>Graeme</hi> was eminent who with <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barre,</hi>
brought timous aide to his Countrey, then in greate dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
by the <hi>Dones;</hi> who having overpowered <hi>England,</hi> from then<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
with greate Armies often, but in vaine, invaded <hi>Scotland.</hi> And
after, that most Noble <hi>Iohn Graeme,</hi> came short, for vertue, &amp; just
renowne of none of all his auncestors; who, after the fatall end
of <hi>Alexander,</hi> the third of that name King of Scots, in the time of
the interraigne (<hi>Bruce,</hi> and <hi>Baliol</hi> then disputing, which of them
two had the iuster right, and title to the Succession) with that so
justly admired William <hi>VVallace</hi> Governour of the Kingdome,
played the most valiant Champion, for defence, and recoverie
of his Countreys libertie, from the unjust usurpation, of <hi>Edward</hi>
the first, King of England. In the which quarrell, after manie
gallant acts atcheived by him, like a worthie Patriotte, he died
nobly, fighting in the Field. The sepulchre of this renowned
Knight, is yet exstant in a Church called <hi>Fallkirk,</hi> for Wallkirk,
from the foresaid Wall of <hi>Severus,</hi> or <hi>Graems</hi> dijke, neare to which
it is built: about the which wall also, the Lord Marques of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trose</hi>
enjoyeth divers large, &amp; fruitfull farmes or feilds by right
of inheritance, from that first <hi>Graeme,</hi> through so manie hands &amp;
ages transmitted unto him.</p>
            <p>Yet, least we may seeme, only to deduce this most famous
worthie, the splendour of his noble Pedegree, from the obscure
trace of so remote antiquitie; we shal descend to later, &amp; better
known times. And so cannot passe his Grandfather Earle of
<hi>Montrose</hi> in silence; who, almost in our own memorie, was rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to places of greatest honour and trust in that Kingdome,
which he most faithfully, and worthly discharged. For being
Lord High <hi>Chauncelour</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> at what time <hi>Iames</hi> the sixt
of that name, of ever blessed memorie went to possesse the
crowne of <hi>England:</hi> he was by the same King created, and left
behind him <hi>Viceroy of Scotland:</hi> in which highest place, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
<pb facs="tcp:33308:11"/>
of dignitie, he died aequally beloved, and deare to King
and people.</p>
            <p>And then, the Father of this man, singularly endowed with
all eminentest graces of mind and body, so as few living in his
time could equall him; and no lesse famous in forragne nations
then at home: For when he hade performed many honourable
Embassages for King <hi>Iames,</hi> was by King <hi>Charles</hi> declared Lord
high President of the Supreme counsell: and being, snatched
away in his prime, by an untimly deathe, from his King, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
and all good men, he died much lamented, and highly
estemed in every mans affections. And now, what men should
think of, and hope from this present man Grandchild to the
Viceroy, and Lord high Presidents Sonne, let every one that
pleaseth, judge, by the things he hath already atcheived, when
now it is a yeare and an halfe, since he left that Kingdome, and
yet hath not attained to the thirty and sixth yeare of his age.</p>
            <p>One thing only more will I adde in thy favour (<hi>Courteous
Reader</hi>) from the auntient Monuments of that Kingdome; That
three, almost, fatall periods have threatned heretofore the <hi>Scots</hi>
Nation; first from the <hi>Romans,</hi> whose yoke our farefathers did
shake of under the conduct of that first <hi>Graeme,</hi> who was lineally
descended out of that auntient, noble Brittish family of the <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentij:</hi>
The second from the <hi>Danes,</hi> who, that they never gotte
the Masterie, and Lordship over vs; we owe it especially to the
greatest valour of that second <hi>Graeme:</hi> The third from the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi>
&amp; <hi>Normans,</hi> whom that thrid <hi>Graeme,</hi> of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ner then once did
beate, and drive out of <hi>Scotland;</hi> and, in many bitter conflicts,
did them much mischeiffe. So that, as they were wont to say
of the <hi>Scipions</hi> in Afrik, we may say, of our <hi>Graems,</hi> that that name
by a luckie destinie hath been appointed for the succour of their
native covntrey in greatest dangers, &amp; distresses: &amp; that in these,
the worst times, that ever was, this man was not raised but by
speciall divine providence, to preserve the Kings just rights, to
restore to his fellow subjects, their wonted peace, libertie &amp; sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetie,
and infinitly to encrease the auncient splendour and glory
of his own Family. And this is all, that I thought fitt to have
briefly praemised of my Lord Marquis of <hi>Montrose.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:33308:12"/>
Now, of the Authour himself, conceive this much; That he
is a man not very conversant in these Studies, nor ambitious to
be praised for excellency of wit, which he acknowledges to have
but small or none; nor covetous of reward, or gaine, which are
the sharpest spurres that in this age doe push men to it, to putte
hand to the Pen. But that, he did put hand to this worke, only
being enflamed with and ardent zeale, of propagating truthe,
to after ages, &amp; forraigners. For how many are ready to patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nise,
and magnifie, even greatest villanies, when they prosper;
and how few to advance, and defend truth, once afflicted,
&amp; cast downe; he had learned by too late and sad experienc, ein a

                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>e very neare of Kinn to this. When the conjured Rebells of
both Kingdomes, by their ordinary tricks of lying, and slande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
had overthrown the Church, that with the revenues the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof,
purchased by hellish sacriledge, they might sacrifice to
their own greedie avarice; and enrich their children, with the
heavie curse of <hi>God:</hi> yet wanted they not those, who extolled
them to the skies, as well deservers of their Countrey, yea of the
verie <hi>Church</hi> it self, which they have pillaged, and even of all
mankind in generall, when, on the contrarie, they proscribed,
defamed, rent, and tore a peeces, with al manner of blasphemies,
and curses, all those most holy men of God, <hi>Confessors</hi> &amp; <hi>Martyrs</hi>
(for so they were indeed) who constantly, and couragiously op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
and withstood their rapines. And therefore he thought,
it was no wayes to be doubted, that those same men, who by the
same wicked practises, we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t about to pul under feete the Majestie
of so good a <hi>King</hi> to swell high, with his honours, prerogatives,
and patrimony, which they had gained, by perfidious trecheries
rebellions, &amp; treasons, would find too to many such sycophants;
whereof the world is full; who by the same libertie of calumni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating,
and reproaching, would backbite this most excellent wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie,
and his Heroicall actions. And, what men say of the waspes,
that they sucke the juice from most fragrant, &amp; wholesome flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers,
which by their own stings, or tongues they empoyson: so
would these Harpyes strive to de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

pens, and as such offer and present them to the ignorant, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warie
world.</p>
            <p>Against this Mischiefe, the Author thought good to offer
this short &amp; plaine discourse as a timely antidote to all that love
sinceritie and truth; whose so faithful &amp; constant a maintainer,
he professeth, and avoucheth himself, that though he did well
foresee, that he should derive upon himself no small hatred, and
envy of many, &amp; mightie men; yet he resolved, neither servilly
to flatter them, nor to envolue the truthe in obscure, doubtfull,
or ambiguous termes. For as he was borne, and bred a <hi>freeman,</hi>
so hath he vowed, never to forsake his libertie but with his life.
And, though he be ambitious of no other commendation of a
good Historian, either of wit, or art, or eloquence; yet this he
thinks he may boldly challenge as his due, that he hath sette
down the simple and naked truth: which to assert, and publish
to the world, he hath foresaken, &amp; undervalued all those things,
which this world holds dearest: thrice robd, and ploundered of
all his goods, thrice cast in vilest, and ugliest dungeons or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and now the third time banished, for the same: yet is he
cheerfull and gladd in heart, that being guiltie of no crime be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
men, the <hi>Lord</hi> hath counpted him worthie to suffer these
things for truth, and righteousnes sake. Love him then, at least
for his truths sake (<hi>Courteous Reader</hi>) &amp; of what rests make the
best you can, by a faire and candid interpretation: &amp; <hi>Farwell.</hi>

well with them as long as one <hi>Stuart</hi> (that's the firname
of the Kings family in <hi>Scotland</hi>) was alive: and in the
extirpation of them, they were first to strike at the
head; so that <hi>Montrose</hi> easily perceived the Kings Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
and Person was levelled at. Therefore vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently
detesting so horrible a crime, hee resolved to
desert the Conspirators side, to frustrate their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
to impoverish their store, to weaken their strength
and with all his might to preserve His Majesty and his
Authority entire and inviolate. But because be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
force and craft, the Covenanters had draw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
in almost all the kingdome to their side, he
saw himselfe alone to weak to check their power
and thereforee thought not good to open him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:33308:14"/>
too suddenly or rashly. Amongst them he had
many friends, men very considerable as well in
regard of their numerous retinues and clients,
as of their wealth and authority: these he had a
minde to draw off from them, and bring them with
him to the Kings, and by this meanes conceived he
should be able to gather no small power, which
would conduce much both to the Kings safety and
his owne.</p>
            <p>Meane time the Covenanters raise a strong army
against the King, and in a solemne Convention at
<hi>Duns,</hi> they determine to invade <hi>England: Montrose</hi>
was absent then. Which resolution of theirs, the
chiefe of the Covenanters had taken up in their cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net
counsels more then six weeks before; and to that
purpose had been busie in divulging through al Great
Britain their Apologeticall Pamphlets, whereby
they laboured to set a good gloosse upon the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of their Expedition. This resolution of theirs
<hi>Montrose</hi> being returned, seeing he could not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
would not seem to disaprove: <hi>Montrosse</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
in this army two thousand foot and five

of five thousand more. And truly if a great part
of them had not beene worse then their words, they
had either brought the whol Army along with them
to the King, or at least had broken the neck of
the Covenanters designes.</p>

the Rebels were not ashamed to taxe <hi>Montrosse</hi> bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:33308:15"/>
enough with those letters: and all though they durst
not make an open quarrell of it, or call him publique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to account, because he was so powerfull and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beloved
in the Army, yet they loaded him with back
bitings &amp; slanders among the people. For they had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged
unto themselves most of the Preachers through
out the Kingdome whose mercenary tongues they
made use of to winde and turn the mindes of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
which way they would. Nor did they promote
their Rebellion more effectually any other way, nor
do yet, then this, to have those doughty Oratours in
their popular preachments to raile bitterly against the
King and all his loyall Subjects, as the <hi>enemies of Christ</hi>
(as they love to speake,) being themselves the while
the very shame and scandall of Christianity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Montrose</hi> returning into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and thinking of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but how to preserve his Majesty from that storm
of Rebellion hanging over his head, at last resolved
of this course. He joynes many of the prime men for
Nobility and Power, in a League with himselfe, in
which they vowed to defend the Kings Majesty, and
all his royall priviledges, and ancient and lawfull Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives,
with the hazard of their lives and estates,
against all his enemies, as well home-bred, as foraign
unto the last breath in their bodies. And truly it
came to that passe, that there had been an open di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
in the Army (which was his aim) had not some
for fear, levity, or cowardise (which are bad keepers
of counsell) betrayed the whole businesse to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanters.
Heare arose no small stirres and braules,
but were pacified againe in a while; for neyther yet
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:33308:16"/>
durst they offer any open violence to <hi>Montrose.</hi> But
afterward the confederates having given a new oath,
made sure the Army at their devotion; and joyning
themselves to the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> in a strict Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
although they saw themselves secure enough
from the subtlest designes of any private man, yet they
seriously consult how they should take <hi>Montrose</hi> out
of the way, whose Heroick spirit being fixt on high
honourable (howsoever difficult) atchievements they
could not endure.</p>
            <p>To make their way therefore unto so villanous an
act, by the assistance of some Courtiers whom with
gifts &amp; promises they had corrupted, they understood
that the King had written letters to <hi>Montrose,</hi> and that
they were quilted in the saddle of the bearer, one <hi>Stuart</hi>
belonging to the Earle of <hi>Traquair.</hi> The beater was
scarce entered the borders of <hi>Scotland</hi> but they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
him, rip his saddle &amp; finde the letters. There was
nothing at all written in them, which did not become
the best of Kings to command, the best of Subjects to
obey. Neverthelesse those most exact crafts-masters
in the arts of Lying and Slandering set about horrible
and tragicall reports by their apt Ministers, that at last
all the Kings plots with <hi>Montrose,</hi> for the overthrow
of Religion, &amp; the ruine of the Kingdome were found
out and discovered. Nor yet neither durst they afford
him a publique tryall, but on a suddain when he sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
nothing, thrust him (with <hi>Napier</hi> Lord of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiston,</hi>
and Sir <hi>Sterling Keer</hi> Knight, two both of his
neer kindred and intimate familiars) into the castle of
<hi>Edinburgh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:33308:16"/>
At length a Pacification being made between the
people of both Kingdomes (between whom there had
been no war, onely they laid their heads together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
their most just and gracious King) a Parliament
was called at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where the King in person was
present. <hi>Montrose</hi> desires most earnestly to be tryed
before the King and that solemne Assembly; but to no
purpose, for the Covenanters being conscious enough
of his innocency and their own guilt, applyed their
speciall endeavours to detain the Gentleman in prison
unheard, untill such time as the King was got out of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> and they had concluded all things with the
King in Parliament according to their hearts desire.
And certainly they were much afraid, lest by his wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and courage, and the esteem he was in, as well
with his Peers of the Nobility, as with the people,
he should have fetch't off the greatest number of
either sort to his own resolution for the preservation
of his Majesties Power and Authority. At last the
King returning into <hi>England; Montrose</hi> and his friends
are set at liberty: and because it was ordered in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that he should not come into conference with
the King he sat still a while at his own house. This
was towards the end of the year 1641.</p>

               <p>IN the year 1642. the Covenanters of both Kingdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes

arme great numbers of the scumme and rascally sort of
the people, and engage them upon the Kings palace;
in a word, threaten all extremity to him &amp; his: whom
although he might have justly punished himself, yet
he chose rather to reser them to the Parliament, that
he might the more oblige it unto himself. But it was
to no end for so gracious a King to gratifie that &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things more to so ungracious, so ingrateful men,
who were the very authors and abettors of these villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.
For he had already granted more and greater
Graces to his Subjects, for the ease of their grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
(which they pretended,) and the security of their
persons and estates, then all his ancestors the Kings of
<hi>England</hi> together, from <hi>William</hi> the conquerour down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.
Therefore at last, that he might withdraw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
&amp; his family from present danger, he is forced sore
against his mind to depart <hi>London:</hi> He sends the Queen
out of the way into <hi>Holland</hi> for the safety of her life, &amp;
betakes himself to <hi>York.</hi> The States of Parliament (as
they call themselves) forthwith, &amp; before the King, take
up armes, and divert those very Forces which the King
had appointed for <hi>Ireland,</hi> which were then in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,

English Rebells, resolved upon no termes to be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to their confederates in so apparent danger as they
were in. And al though our most gracious King had
given them satisfaction (as much as ever they could
desire) in that Parliament at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> aforesaid, which
also they have recorded among their publique Acts,
neverthelesse they provide themselves for a march into
<hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that they might the better secure their affaires
at home, they labour tooth and naile to draw <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trose</hi>
(of whom almost onely they were afraid) againe
to their side. They offer him of their own accord the
office of Lievenant Generall in the Army, and what
ever else he could desire and they bestow. He seeing
a mighty storm hovering over the Kings head, that he
might give him an account of it whereby it might be
timely prevented, undertakes a journey into <hi>England</hi>
taking the Lord <hi>Ogilby</hi> into his counsell and company.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Newcastle</hi> he received newes that the Queen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

did they want hearts, or wealth, or power to oppose against
the Covenanters if they durst enterprise any thing against the
King: all that they wanted was the Kings Commission, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which they durst doe nothing, with which any thing; and
all the danger that was, was in delay: That the Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
when they had once got their army on foot would be able
to grinde any one to pieces that should offer to stirre; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the beginnings of so great an evill were to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,

               </p>
               <p>Wholesome counsell it was, and seasonable,
which doubtlesse the most prudent Queen had
approved of. But while things were going on
in so good a posture, al things were quash't by
the coming of the Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> out of <hi>Scotland</hi>
upon pretence of kissing the Queens hand, and
gratulating her happy returne, but in very deed
that he might overthrow <hi>Montrose</hi> his counsels;
for he had posted thither with the knowledge &amp;
consent of the Covenanters. Nor did he himself
dissemble that there was some danger from the
Scottish Covenanters, but he laboured to exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
it; and condemned the counsel of <hi>Montrose</hi>
as rash, unadvised, and unseasonable.</p>

That stout and warlike nation was not to be reduced with
force and armes, but with gentlenesse and courtesies: Warre,
especially Civill warre, should be the last remedy, and used ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times to be repented of even by the Conquerous. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
of warre was uncertaine; if the King should get the best,
it would be but a sorry triumph he could enjoy over his own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects:
but if he had the worst on't, he must expect what hÃ®s soule
<hi>(goodman)</hi> abhorred to speake. All meanes were to be tryed
to preserve peace with that Nation, nor were things yet come to
that passe, that the King should despaire of amity and reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation
with them: He would be ready to take the whole busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> himself, if the King pleased to commit it to his paines
and trust, &amp; to authorise him sufficiently thereunto. <hi>Montro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
replyed,</hi> nothing would come of that but the delay of time,
untill the Traitors having raised an Army should prevent the
King of any meanes to deliver himself and his party from their
tyranny. <hi>The sad event proved al this to be too true; but
in this debate</hi> Montrose <hi>was faine to suffer himself to be
overborn, being not so great a Courtier as the other;
nor were those vertues which the world now admires
discovered then unto the Queen.</hi> Hamilton <hi>returning
into</hi> Scotland, <hi>seemed to be as active for the King as was
possible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Covenanters mean while by their owne au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
(contrary to the known Lawes of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome)
summon a Parliament at <hi>Edinburgh;</hi> which
all understanding men that wished well unto the King
foresaw would be of very dangerous consequence to
his affaires, &amp; therefore abhorred it so much that they
intended not to honour it with their presence. But
<hi>Hamilton</hi> interposing the name and authority of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:33308:19"/>
of the King, invited the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> by his letters that they would
not faile to be all there; and that they should not doubt
but they would be able to out-vote the Covenanters,
if at this time they were not wanting to the Kings cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se.
And if it should happen otherwise, he would be
ready with his friends, to protest against the Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
&amp; immediately to leave them. Abundance of the
Nobility incited by the name of the King, &amp; those ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes,
were present at that Parliament, onely <hi>Montrose</hi> and
a few of his adherents staid away. And with <hi>Montrose</hi>
to the Duke had dealt by his friends, that as he loved &amp;
honoured the King he would joyn himself unto them.
But he (who had reason to suspect all motions that ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
that way) answered, that he was ready to grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
with any difficulty, especially under his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
who had so great an honour as to be the Kings
supreme Commissioner; onely on this condition,
that the Duke should engage his honour, that if they
could not bring up that Parliament to righteous things
he would endeavour to enforce them by the dint of
the sword. He answered, he would protest, he would
not fight. Which passage considered, <hi>Montrose</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
his integrity, expecting the issue, betooke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to his own home.</p>
               <p>In that Parliament, the Covenanters out-voted the
Loyall party by seventy voyces or there abouts, tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled
upon the Royall authority, arrogated unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
the power of calling of Paliaments, pressing
Souldiers, sending Embassadours, and other things hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
unattempted, without the Kings knowledge or
tonsent. And to make up the measure of their presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

and treason, ordaine that a powerfull Army shall
be raied against the King, and in the aid or their confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates

               <p>
                  <hi>Montrose</hi> therefore, who saw the king was like to
be ruined by his own authority, and saw to that he
was too weake to oppose himself both against the
strength of the Covenanters &amp; the Kings abused Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
in a melancholy mood made as if he took no
notice of any thing. And the Covenanters, supposing
that he had received some distaste from the King, by
reason of the affront he received at <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Hamiltons</hi>
over-povvering him, they set upon him yet againe,
privately and by friends, to see if by intreaty or inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
they could draw him to their side; offering him
authority and wealth, even the greatest Honour
Civill and Military. Which offers he did not seem
much to slight, that by that meanes he might have an
easier vvay to dive into their counsells. The Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters
that this groving friendship might be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
cemented and sanctified (God blesse us) send unto
him that great Apostle of their Covenant, <hi>Alexander
Henderson,</hi> who should give him full satisfaction in all
his scruples. <hi>Montrose</hi> heartily desired to speake with
that fellow, out of whom he doubted not to pump all
the secrets of the Covenanters: and lest a private mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

give the ill opinion of his enemies leave to breath it selfe after some

of what was done in Parliament; that he was almost at a
losse how to behave himselfe in that ticklish condition the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
stood; and therefore beseeched him for old acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
sake to let him freely know what they intended. Henderson
<hi>taking it for granted by these expressions that he
was wheeling about towards the Covenanters, that
he might the more oblige the Marquesse unto him, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
him flatly and without more adoe,</hi> That it was
resolved to send as strong an army as they could raise, in aid
of their brethren of <hi>England</hi> against the Kings forces; that the
Covenanters of both Kingdomes had unanimously agreed upon this;
either to dye or bring the King to their lure; that nothing could
fall out more happily, then that he should renew his friendship
with his Peers of the Nobility, and the rest of the Kingdome; that
so doing he would give great content to all men, besides the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and profit that would redound to himselfe; that by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
others (if others there were) that idolized the empty sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of the Kings name, would give most hearty thanks unto his
Lord God that he had vouchsafed to make use of him as the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
and ever Mediatour of so great a worke; <hi>and at last
entreated him</hi> to speake out his minde, and commit all such things
to his care and industry as he should desire from the Parliaments,
either in relation to his honour or profit; assuring him he satisfied
his hearts desire.</p>

                  <hi>Montrose</hi> having gotten out the knowledge
of those things which he eagerly sought for, now
bethought himselfe how he should keep <hi>Henderson</hi>
and his party in suspence a while, that they should
not yet get within him. For what answere could
he give them? If he should professe himselfe to be
against their courses, that would doe the King no
good, and might bring a great deale of danger
upon himselfe: and on the other side, to put
them in greater hopes of him, by promising those
things he never meant to performe, as being a
staine unto his honour. Therefore he takes this
course; there was present at that conference with
<hi>Hinderson</hi> one Sir <hi>Iames Rollock,</hi> Chiefe of a very
ancient and flourishing family; his former wife had
been <hi>Montrose</hi> his sister after whose death he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
the sister of the Marques of <hi>Argyle,</hi> the
ring-leader of the Covenanters in <hi>Scotland:</hi> thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
allied unto them both, he seemed to be a very
fit mediatour of friendship between them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montrose</hi> askes him whether those things which
had passed between them proceeded from the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of the Parliament, or out of their owne
good wills? He answered, he conceived that
Master <hi>Henderson</hi> had received Commission from
the Parliament to that purpose; but <hi>Henderson</hi>
said no, but he made no question but the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
would make good any thing that he
promised. <hi>Montrose</hi> told them, he could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue
upon nothing except he had the Publque.

The King was absent thence, being gone to the siege of
<hi>Glocester.</hi> He imparts unto the Queen what designes
the Scottish Covenanters had against his Majesty; but

               <p>Montrose, <hi>seeing no good was to be done with the

King himselfe: How</hi> there was a powerfull army to be raised
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> &amp; a day appointed on which it should be brought
into <hi>England;</hi> how their counsels were manifestly knowne
unto him; &amp; how to fetch him over to their side, they had offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him very honourable Commands in the army: but that he
heartily detesting so horrid an employment had fled to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
that he having notice thereof, if he were not able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
so timely &amp; powerful a remedy as could be wished, at least
might cast some blocks &amp; rubs in their way untill such time as
he had settled his affaires in <hi>England;</hi> that the traitours of
either Kingdome might be easily dealt withall by themselves,
but if they came once to joyne their forces they would be hardly
supprest; that there were very many in <hi>Scotland</hi> who would sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
themselves and all that they had for their dearest King,
whose good will would be of no use unto his Majesty after the
Covenanters had raised their army, but destructive unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
that the haughty spirits of the Traitors were to be sneap't

               <p>These things, and to this effect did <hi>Montrose</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
presse unto the King, but in vaine, for he had not
onely the strong and deeply rooted confidence his

Majesty had of the <hi>Hamiltons</hi> to struggle with, but the
devices of a set of desperate Courtiers beside, who
daily buzzed in the Kings eares <hi>Montrose's</hi> youth, his
rashnesse, his ambition, the envy and hatred he bare
unto the <hi>Hamiltons,</hi> and what not; &amp; on the other side,
the <hi>Hamiltons</hi> fidelity, their honesty, their discretion,
their power. Thus <hi>Montrose</hi> nothing prevailes &amp; the
King returnes to his winter quarters at <hi>Oxford.</hi> And
al though his Majesty saw very well (reports coming
thick and threefold of the Scottish army) that all was
true that <hi>Montrose</hi> had told him, yet the most reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
King determined upon no termes to give any
occasion of quarrell to the Scots till first they entered
<hi>England;</hi> resolving that he for his part would perfectly
observe the Articles of Pacification he had made with
them, which if they should violate, he doubted no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

but they should highly answer it both to God &amp; him.
While these things were discussed at <hi>Oxford,</hi> the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanters
in <hi>Scotland</hi> bring their businesse about accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

raise as big an army as they can, which consisted of
eighteen thousand Foot and two thousand Horse;
and at last when they had marched unto the very bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
the <hi>Hamiltons</hi> were not ashamed to give the
King notice by letters of the approach of that formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
Army; making this their excuse, that according
to their engagement they had prevented an invasion
the summer before, but now that winter was come
on they were able to keep them out no longer, but
they would come in immediately with a powerfull
Army. The King when he saw himselfe thus grosly

that for above a twelve-month hee had been continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally

he accounted himselfe very unhappy that all that whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le

now that they had got an army, all that they had
without striking a stroke. The King complaining that
he was most abominably betrayed by them with
whom he had entrusted his Crowne, his Secrets, his

the lamentablenesse of the condition in which

some course to procure and transport some armes out
of some forraigne countrey into <hi>Scotland:</hi> nothing nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
more but humane industry, the successe was Gods
part, and to be referred to his providence. The King
commending his counsell, &amp; giving him thankes that
he apprehended some life in the businesse, encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
him to fit himselfe cheerfully for so great a worke
&amp; wished him to leave the care of those things he had
requested unto him.</p>
               <p>And truly for the matter of aid out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> the
King sends for the Earle of <hi>Antrim,</hi> and acquaints him
with <hi>Montrose's</hi> design. This <hi>Antrim</hi> is of Scottish ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction,
descended of the noble and ancient Family of
the <hi>Mac-Donalds,</hi> a man of great estate and power in
<hi>Ireland,</hi> &amp; allyed to the prime Nobility of <hi>England,</hi> by
matching with the Duchesse of <hi>Buckingham.</hi> He being
driven out of his own countrey lived at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and
cheerfully undertooke the negotiation with the <hi>Irish</hi>

by the first of <hi>Aprill</hi> 1644. this passed in <hi>December</hi> 1643.
And as for forraigne aides and armes, the King sent
Sir <hi>Iohn Cockeram</hi> his Embassadour about it with his
Commission and Instructions. And directions unto
the <hi>Marquesse</hi> of <hi>Newcastle</hi> were carried by some of
<hi>Montrose's</hi> own company. Who receiving the Kings
Letters and Commission to be Governour of <hi>Scotland</hi>

the Army, that they were banished their Countrey
that they had been plundered of their estates by the
Covenanters for their loyalty to the King, and that
for safety of their lives, (with which they had hardly
escaped,) they fled to <hi>Oxford.</hi> But <hi>Montrose</hi> and those
of his minde saw plainly that these were but tales o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of this new guilt; and that by this meanes, they
in confidence of that esteeme they had lately with
the King, and of a strong faction they drove at Court
doubted not but they should stand as fair in his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

therefore humbly besought the King that he would
give him leave to seeke his fortune in some forraigne
countrey, if these men that had deceived him so of
should be received againe into favour: not that he
desired any severyty should be used against them, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he wished the King might have a care that they

should do him no more harme. The King was drawne

the Court, yet for all that he suffered the Earl of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nericke</hi>
to live in the City. But he (by whose instiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
I cannot tell) betakes himself from <hi>Oxford</hi> to
<hi>Londen</hi> to the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> and not long
after to the Scotch Army which had now entered
<hi>England,</hi> and never since hath failed to doe them the
best service he could. The escape of his brother so
much moved the King, that he saw it high time to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the Duke himself.</p>
               <p>There were severall Scots in the Kings Court and
Army who were suspected (and perhaps not without
reason) to favour the Covenanters too much, and to
give intelligence unto them of the Kings counsels.
<hi>Montrose</hi> that he might put these to the touch tooke
this course, He got a Protestation to be drawne up by
the Kings authority, unto which all Scots who would
have the reputation of honest men were to set their<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

hands: Wherein <hi>they professed themselves heartily to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
the courses of the Covenanters, condemned especially
the bringing in of an army into</hi> England <hi>against the King
and the Lawes of the Land as an act of high treason; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
and vowed to acquit themselves of that scandall, and
to the utmost of their power, with the hazard of their lives
and fortunes, to oppose those that were guilty of that crime.</hi>
This Protestation all men of honour and honesty rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
tooke; but there were two, in whom the King
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>rusted most of all Scotch men next to the <hi>Hamiltons,</hi>
to wit, the Earle of <hi>Trequaire,</hi> &amp; Mr. <hi>William Murray</hi> of
the Bed chamber, who were difficultly brought unto it
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:33308:25"/>
at last with much reluctancy, and fear of being disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
traitours: yet even they engaged themselves by
a solemne Oath at a certain day to be aiding &amp; assisting
unto <hi>Montrose</hi> in <hi>Scotland;</hi> which Oath of theirs after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
they most unworthily violated.</p>
               <p>This being done, and <hi>Montrose</hi> on his journey from
<hi>Oxford</hi> towards <hi>Scotland,</hi> those that were the <hi>Hamiltons</hi>
creatures, and other false-hearted Courtiers began to
blast the Honour of <hi>Montrose,</hi> to call him a vaine and
ambitious man who had attempted an impossible
thing: to extoll above measure the power of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanters,
and that they might dete<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

engaging himself in so noble an exploit, gave out every
where most maliciously, that no good was ever to be
expected from <hi>Montrose.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He being little troubled with the calumnies of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthey
men, came forward to <hi>Yorke</hi> &amp; so to <hi>Durham:</hi>
where he sees that the Kings Instructions be sent to
the Marquesse of <hi>Newcastle,</hi> and the next day they met
and conferred, <hi>Newcastle</hi> discours't of nothing but the
distresses and necessities of his Army; how the Rebell
Scots breaking in in the midst of winter had spoiled
his Recruits, and that now in farre greater numbers
then he they quartered within five miles of him; that
he could not possibly spare any Horse without a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
hazard to the whole Army. <hi>Montrose</hi> urged on the
other side, that nothing could do. <hi>Newcastle</hi> more ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
then to let him have a party of Horse (in which he
was very strong) with him into <hi>Scotland,</hi> that so he
might either divert or at least divide the enemy, and
by kindling a fire in their owne houses fetch them ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:33308:25"/>
againe to defend themselves. <hi>Newcastle</hi> courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
replyed, that assoon as he had wound himself
out of that present danger, he would not be wanting
in any service to <hi>Montrose:</hi> which promise, there is
no doubt but a person of so much Honour and
Loyalty would most surely have performed, had
he continued any while in the Command of tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
parts. In the meane time, all that he could
do for the present was, to afford him about one
hundred Horse, but lean ones, and ill accou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,
(which was not the Generals fault but so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
mens private spleen) with two brasse Field-pieces.</p>
               <p>Moreover he sent his Orders unto the Kings
Officers and Commanders in <hi>Cumberland</hi> and <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morland,</hi>
that they should give <hi>Montrose</hi> all the
succour and assistance they could make for his
journey into <hi>Scotland. Montrose</hi> going towards
<hi>Carlisle</hi> was accordingly met by the <hi>Cumberland</hi> and
<hi>Westmorland</hi> men, consisting of eight hundred
Foot, and three troops of Horse; who accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Marquesse of <hi>Newcastles</hi> Command,
were to waite upon him into <hi>Scotland. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trose</hi>
himselfe brought with him two hundred
Horse, most of them Noblemen and Gentlemen,
and such as had been Captaines either in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
France,</hi> or <hi>England.</hi> With which small for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
(nor over trusty neither) he entered <hi>Scotland</hi>
on the 13. of <hi>Aprill;</hi> for he made the more hast,
lest he should have been absent at the time appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Earl of <hi>Antrim.</hi>

English, occasioned by <hi>Richard Grahams</hi> Souldiers,
almost all of them flie their Colours, and in all hast
runne back to <hi>England.</hi> Notwithstanding he with
his own men came to <hi>Dunfrise,</hi> and took the Towne
into protection upon surrender: and there he staid a
while that he might be ready to entertaine <hi>Antrim</hi> and
his <hi>Irish;</hi> but the day appointed being already pass'd,
there came not so much as a Messenger from them, nor
the least report of them into <hi>Scotland.</hi> And the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanters
gathering themselves together on every
side, there was no staying there any longer for <hi>Montro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se,</hi>
without being surprised; therefore he returns safe to
<hi>Carlisle</hi> with his men. And seeing he could neither
procure any aid from the English, nor expect any
Forraigners suddenly, nor had scarse any hopes of
good from <hi>Ireland;</hi> and found that the Earle of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendar</hi>
had raised a new Army in <hi>Scotland</hi> to second Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<hi>Lesly,</hi> who had by this time together with the
English Covenanters besiged <hi>Yorke,</hi> he resolved, lest
he should spend his time idlely, to engage himselfe
among the Kings Forces in <hi>Northumberland</hi> &amp; the <hi>Bish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oprick;</hi>
nor was that resolution either unprofitable
to them, or dishonorable to himself.</p>
               <p>For having ferretted a Garrison of the Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
out of the towne of <hi>Morpet,</hi> he took in the
Castle, permitted all the pillage unto the English, and
taking an Oath of them that had held it, that they
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:33308:26"/>
should never more fight against the King; he sent
them away without any greater punishment. He
tooke a Fort at the mouth of the river of <hi>Tine</hi> from
the Covenanters, (who had not long before turned
out an English Garrison from thence) and dismist the
prisoners upon the same termes with those of <hi>Morpet.</hi>
He ple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>tifully victualled <hi>Newcastle</hi> with corne brought
from <hi>Alnwicke,</hi> and other places thereabouts. When
this was done, he was sent for by letters from Prince
<hi>Rupert</hi> Count Palatine of <hi>Rhine,</hi> who was then co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to raise the siege of <hi>Yorke.</hi> And although he
made all the haste he could, yet he met not the

unfortunate battell. And truly the Prince freely of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered

into <hi>Scotland,</hi> but some that were too powerfull with
him dealt so with the good Prince, that the

not one horse to be had.</p>
               <p>All things thus failing <hi>Montrose</hi> from which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
any assistance, yet his spirit never failed him:
therefore returning to <hi>Carlisle</hi> with those few but
faithfull and gallant men that strucke close to him, he
sends away the Lord <hi>Ogleby</hi> and Sir <hi>William Rollock</hi> into
the heart of <hi>Scotland</hi> in meane disguise, lest they
should be discovered by the enemy. Within a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night
they returned, &amp; brought word that all things
in <hi>Scotland</hi> were desperate; all Passes, Castles, Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
possessed with Garrisons of the Covenanters, nor
could they finde any one so hardy as to dare to speake
reverently or affectionately of the King. Most of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:33308:27"/>
those who had adhered to <hi>Montrose</hi> all this while,
being cast downe with this sad newes, bethought
themselves of bending their courses some other way,
especially when they were tampered with by that
honest man the Earle <hi>Traquair</hi> to desert the service:
who forgetting all his vowes and imprecations he
had made before the King, undertook in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
of the Covenanters, not only for Indemnity
to all that should fall off unto them, but rewards
and preferments too; as if he had been all this
while an Agent for the Rebells, and not for the
King as he pretended. And yet this man was
greater in the Kings favour, and more confided in
then any one except the <hi>Hamiltons.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Montrose</hi> calling his friends to counsell, desires
them to deliver their opinions what they concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
was fittest to be done in this sad face of things.</p>
               <p>Some advise him to repaire to the King at <hi>Oxford,</hi>
and certifie him that his Scotch Affaires were past
recovery; that <hi>Antrim</hi> came not with his Irish For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
nor was there any appearance of them; that
little or no assistance had been obtained from the
English; and as for Armes or aid from Forraigne
parts, he had not so much as heard a word of
them; so that it was none of his fault that his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
had no better successe.</p>
               <p>Others were of opinion that it was better for him
to excuse himself by Letters unto the King and to
send up his Commission a long with them, and
that he himself should step a while aside into some
other Countrey till such time as it should please
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:33308:27"/>
God to send better opportunities. But all agreed
in this, that nothing more was to be attempted
or thought of in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But he himselfe onely entertained farre other
thoughts in his high and undaunted spirit: He
conceived himselfe bound never to forsake his dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
Lord the King though in extreamest hazards,
and that it was an unworthinesse to despaire of so
good a cause; and if he should attempt some grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
matter then came within the reach or apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of common men, he conjectured it might prove
much to his owne Honour, and some thing perhaps
to the Kings good too. For as it was dubious, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it might please God in his mercy to looke upon
the King with a more favourable eye, and to turne his
adversity into prosperity; so it was most certaine that if
he should not be able to goe thorough with it but pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
in the enterprise, he should die with Honour, and
his fall should be much lamented. So resolved, and
commending himselfe and his successe to the disposall
and protection of Almighty God, he performed such
Adventures without men, without money, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
armes, as were not onely to the astonishment
of us that were present, and were eye and eare wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
of them, but also the example and envy both,
of all great Commanders hereafter. What those were
we shall declare by and by.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montrose</hi> delivers those few Gentlemen that had
been constant unto him to the Lord <hi>Ogleby,</hi> to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
unto the King, (for as he had communicated all
his former designes unto him, so he did this also) and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:33308:28"/>
conjureth him withall to deale earnestly with his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
for hastening of some aid, if not of Men yet of
Armes at least, from beyond seas. So he accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
them two dayes on their journey, and leaving
with them his Horses, his Servants, and his Carria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
conveyed himself privily away from them, and
with what speed he could came back to <hi>Carlisle.</hi> The
company suspecting nothing of his departure, because
<hi>Ogleby</hi> and other his dearest friends were still with
them, marched on straight towards <hi>Oxford;</hi> but
theither they never reached for most of them (of
whom were the Lord <hi>Ogleby</hi> himself, Sir <hi>Iohn Innes,</hi> &amp;
Colonell <hi>Henry Graham</hi> his brother, a most hopefull
young Gentleman, <hi>Iames, Iohn,</hi> and <hi>Alexander Oglebyes,
Patricke Melvin,</hi> and other gallant men, and highly
esteemed by <hi>Montrose</hi>) fell into the enemies hands, &amp;
endured a long &amp; nasty imprisonment untill they were
set at liberty by <hi>Montrose</hi> himself the next yeare, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which they did him most faithfull service. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
to <hi>Carlisle</hi> imparts his designe to the Earle of
<hi>Aboine,</hi> least he should have any occasion to cavill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
that a matter of that consequence was done
without his knowledge or advice, who might have
proved able to give a great stroke to the advancing of
it. But when he found some thing too much ficklenesse
in that young man, he was not over earnest to engage
him to adventure with him in so perillous a journey;
and therefore easily perswaded him to reside at <hi>Carlisle</hi>
till he heard further newes out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> by which
time it might be more seasonable for him to returne
into his Countrey.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:33308:28"/>
And now being prepared for his journey, he selected
onely two men for his companions and guides; one
was Sir <hi>William Rollock</hi> a Gentleman of most knowne
honesty, and an able man both of his head and hands.
The other was one <hi>Sibbald,</hi> whom for the report of his
valour and gallantry, <hi>Montrose</hi> did equally love &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour:
but the latter afterwards deserted him in his
greatest need. <hi>Montrose</hi> passing as <hi>Sibbalds</hi> man, &amp; being
disguised in the habit of a Groome, rode along upon a
leane jade, &amp; led another horse in his hand. And so he
came to the borders where he found all ordinary and
safe passes guarded by the enemy. There was a chance
happened which put them in a greater fright then all
that, &amp; it was this; not farre from the borders they hit
by chance upon a servant of Sir <hi>Richard Grahams,</hi> who
taking them for Covenanters, &amp; to be of <hi>Lesley's</hi> Army
who used to range about those parts, told them freely
&amp; confidently that his Master had made his peace with
the Covenanters, and had undertaken (as if he were
their Centinell) to discover unto them all such as
came that way whom he suspected to favour the King.
An unworthy act it was of a shamelesse villaine, of
whom, not onely <hi>Montrose</hi> had a very high esteem,
buth is Majesty also, whose mistaken bounty had raised
him out of the dunghill (to say no worse) unto the
honour of Knighthood, and an estate even to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
of his neighbours.</p>
               <p>Having not passed much further, they met a soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier,
a Scothman, but one that had served under the
Marquesse of <hi>Newcastle</hi> in <hi>England</hi> who taking no notice
of the other two Gentlemen, came to <hi>Montrose</hi> and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:33308:29"/>
salute him by his name: <hi>Montrose</hi> giving no heed
unto him, as if he were no such man, the too
officious souldier would not be so put off, but
with a voyce and countenance full of humility and
duty began to cry out, <hi>What? Doe not I know my Lord
Marquesse of</hi> Montrose <hi>well enough? Goe your way,
and God be with you whither soever you goe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When he saw it was in vaine to conceale himself
from the man, he gave him a few crownes and sent
him away, nor did he discover him afterwards. But
<hi>Montrose</hi> conceiving himselfe much concerned in
these speeches, thought it the best course to make
all the haste he could, and to run faster then the newes
of him could flie: nor did he spare any horse flesh, or
scarce draw a bridle till after foure dayes travell he
came to the house of his cosen <hi>Patrick Graham</hi> of <hi>Innis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brake,</hi>
not farre from the river of <hi>Tay</hi> on that side of
the Sherifdome of <hi>Perth</hi> which is next the mountains.
This <hi>Patrick</hi> being descended of the noble family of
<hi>Montrose,</hi> and not unworthy of so noble parentage,
was deservedly in very great esteeme with the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quesse;
who so journed besides him for a little while
in the day time in a meane cottage, and passed the
nights alone in the neighbouring mountains. For
he had sent away his companions unto his friends,
that they might inform themselves exactly of the
whole state of the Kingdome, and bring him word
in wat condition they found it.</p>
               <p>After a few dayes, having examined the matter
with all the industry they could use, they retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
with nothing but sad and tragicall newes: <hi>That all
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:33308:29"/>
the Subjects that were honest and loyall, lay under the tyranny
of the Rebells; and of such as had been so hardy as to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to recover their freedome with their swords, some were
put to death, others fin'd, others being yet in prison, daily
expected the worst their enemies could doe; That the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quesse
of</hi> Huntley <hi>had laid downe the armes which too unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visedly
he had taken up at the first summons of the enemy; that
indeed he had had no contemptible number of men, but the
men wanted a good Commander; that his friends and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants
were exposed to the implacable malice and revenge of
their enemies, and that he himself had fled to the uttermost
corner of the Land, and sculked upon another mans land.
Montrose</hi> was very much troubled (as he had reason)
at this newes, especially at <hi>Huntley's</hi> errour and the
ruine of the <hi>Gordons,</hi> who were men of singular loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and valour, and expert souldiers, therefore much
lamented by him, that for no fault of theirs, they
should come to so great misfortune. And now he
began to cast about how he might daw them to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
that they might try againe the fortune of Warre
under another Generall in the behalf of his most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Majesty.</p>

               <p>IN the meane time there were some uncertaine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports

which the Earle of <hi>Antrim</hi> had promised should have

where <hi>Montrose</hi> was beleeved still to remaine. He,
who never dreamed of <hi>Montrose's</hi> returne into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
though he sojourned by him, by chance acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Mr. <hi>Patricke Graham</hi> with the businesse, he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
to take charge of them, and undertaketh to see

               </p>
               <p>The people of <hi>Athole</hi> were engaged unto <hi>Montrose</hi>

all the Highlanders, both for their Loyalty, Piety,
Constancy, and singular Valour; and truly they made
good his opinion of them to the very end of the
Warre. The <hi>Irish,</hi> with a very few Highlanders who
were almost all of <hi>Badeneth,</hi> receiving <hi>Montrose's</hi>
commands, marched straight into <hi>Athole,</hi> He, who
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:33308:30"/>
was not above twenty miles from them, comes to
them immediately, and or ever they looked for him,
on foot, in the habit of a Mountanier, without any
man along with him save the abovesaid <hi>Patricke Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
his guide and companion. And indeed the Irish
would hardly be perswaded that that was <hi>Montrose;</hi>
but wen they saw him so saluted, and onely not ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
like some great Deity, by the men of <hi>Athole</hi> and
others that knew him well, they were overjoyed:
for his coming to them was in exceeding good time,
they being then in extreame danger to be cut off. For
<hi>Argyle</hi> was in their reare with a strong and well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
Army, the champaine countrey were ready in
armes before them, expecting if they should make
downe into the Plaine, to trample them to dirt with
their horses hoofes; the vessels that brought them<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>
over were burnt by <hi>Argyle,</hi> that they might have no
way to retreat; nor would the <hi>Athole</hi> men or any
other that favoured the King venture any hazard with
them, because they were strangers and came not by
the Kings open and known Authority; nor had they
any Commander of ancient Nobility, a thing by the
Highlanders much set by, who would not fight un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the command of <hi>Alexander Mac-donell,</hi> a
man of no account with them: lastly their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
was inconsiderable, being not above ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
hundred, though ten thousand had been
promised.</p>
               <p>The next day, the <hi>Athole</hi> men to the number of
eight hundred put themselves in armes, &amp; offered their
service most cheerfully to <hi>Montrose,</hi> who having got his
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:33308:31"/>
handfull of men and earnestly commending his most
righteous Cause to the protection of Almighty God,
now desired nothing more then to be among the
thickest of the enemy. Impatient therefore of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
delay, that very day he marches through the
Plains of <hi>Athole</hi> towards <hi>Ern;</hi> as well to make way
for his friends and assistants easier accesse unto him (if
any should rise upon the newes) as that he might fall
upon and amaze the Rebels unlook't for, before they
should be able to joyne together who lay at distance.
Therefore passing by <hi>Weme</hi> a castle of the <hi>Menises,</hi>
seeing they handled a Trumpeter whom he sent frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
unto them unworthily, and fell hotly upon the reare
of his Army, he wastes their fields, and causes all their
houses and corne to be fired; this was at the very first
onset of the Warre, to strike terrour into the enemy.
The same night he passed over <hi>Tay,</hi> the greatest river in
<hi>Scotland,</hi> with part of his Forces; the rest follow him
very early the next day. When they were ready to
march on, he gave <hi>Patrick Graham</hi> (of whom I shall
haue often to speak, &amp; never without honour) at their
earnest request the Command of the <hi>Athole</hi> men, &amp; sent
him with the nimblest of them he could pick out
amongst them to scout before. He brings word he saw
some souldiers drawne up on the top of an hill at <hi>Buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinth</hi>
towards them <hi>Montrose</hi> makes straight. These
proved to be commanded by the Lord <hi>Kilpont</hi> son to
the Earle of <hi>Taith,</hi> a man of ancient Nobility, and des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
of the <hi>Grahams;</hi> and Sir <hi>Iohn Drummond,</hi> sonne

                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>;</hi> who
were both of them summoned by the Covenanters to
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:33308:31"/>
joyne against the Irish as the Common enemy, and
had with them five hundred Foot and no more; nor
had they heard any certainty at all of <hi>Montrose's</hi> being
in those parts. He resolveth with all speed to surprise
them, and either to winne them to his side or to crush
them to pieces. But they as soone as they heard that
<hi>Montrose</hi> was Generall of those Forces, send unto him
some of their chiefest friends to understand from him
what he intended to doe. He tells them he had the
Kings Authority for what he did, and was resolved
to assert that Authority to the utmost of his power
against a most horrid Rebellion, conjuring them by all
the obligations that were betweene them, that they
would not thinke much to doe their best endeavours
for the best of Kings. Which as it was much becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their high birth, and would be very acceptable
service to the King, so it would be beneficiall unto
them for the present, and much to their honour with
posterity and strangers, if they of all others should be
the first that put to their helping hands to hold up a
tottering Crowne. They most readily with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any delay came in unto him; for both of
them though underhand favoured the King ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly.</p>
               <p>From them <hi>Montrose</hi> understood that the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters
were thick in armes at a Rendezvouz at <hi>Perth</hi>
(the second City to <hi>Edinburgh</hi>) and there waited for
their enemies falling down from <hi>Athole.</hi> He knowing
also that <hi>Argile</hi> with his Army was upon his backe, lest
he should be hem'd in on both sides<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> determines to
goe forward to <hi>Perth,</hi> that there he might either force
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:33308:32"/>
the enemy to fight, or reduce the Towne to the Kings
obedience. Marching therefore three miles from
<hi>Buckinth,</hi> and allowing the Souldiers but a short time
of refreshment, at the breake of day he drawes out
his men. Nor was he above three miles more from
the City, whem the enemy was in view in a large and
open Plain (called <hi>Tippermore</hi>) providing to fight.
They were commanded by the Lord <hi>Elchoe,</hi> one that
was taken for no great souldier: there were with him
the Earle of <hi>Tullibardin,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Drummond,</hi> but
this latter (as was conceived) against his will, for he &amp;
his fathers whole family favoured the King in their
hearts: Knights he had with him good store, among
whom Sir <hi>Iames Scot</hi> (who heretofore had done good
service under the State of <hi>Venice</hi>) was the most noted
souldier. They had six thousand Foot &amp; seven hundred
Horse, and in confidence of their numbres, they had
even devoured their enemies before they saw them. It
was on Sunday the first of <hi>September,</hi> &amp; it was given in
charge to their Ministers, that in set Speeches they
should encourage the people to fight, not forgetting
to minde them of their most holy Covenant forsooth.
And to give them their due they plyed their lungs
stoutly in the performance of that worke; they most
freely promised them in the name of Almighty God
an easie and unbloudy victory; nay, there was one
<hi>Frederick Carmiohael,</hi> one very much cryrd up for lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and holinesse by the silly people, who was not
afraid to deliver this passage in his Sermon, <hi>If ever God
spake word of truth out of my mouth, I promise you in his name
assured victory this day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:33308:32"/>
Gods service being thus finely performed as they
thought, they put their men in <hi>Battalia. Elchoe</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
commanded the right flank, Sir <hi>Iames Scot</hi> the left,
and the Eare of <hi>Tullebardin</hi> the battell. To the right
and left flanks were added wings of horse, with which
they made no doubt on so faire a Plaine to hemme in
the enemy. <hi>Montrose</hi> perceiving the great body of
the enemy, and especially their strength in Horse,
(for he had not so much as one Horse-man, nor more
then three leane horses) and being carefull (as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
him) lest being incompassed with so great a
number, they should fall upon him in the Front, Reare
and Flanke, he caused his Army to be drawne out to
as open order as could be possible, and makes his Files
onely three deep. He commands the Ranks all to
discharge at once, those in the first Ranke kneeling, in
the second stooping, and in the hindmost, where he
placed the tallest men, upright: he chargeth them
also to have a care of mis-spending their powder, of
which they had so small store, and that they should
not so much as make a shot till they came to the very
teeth of their enemies; &amp; assoone as they had dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
their muskets once a piece, immediately to breake
in upon the enemy with their swords &amp; musket ends;
which if they did, he was very confident the enemy
would never endure the charge. <hi>Montrose</hi> undertakes
the Command of the right Flanke over against Sir
<hi>Iames Scot,</hi> appoints the left to the Lord <hi>Kilpont,</hi> &amp; the
maine Battell to <hi>Mac donell</hi> with his Irish: vvhich vvas
very providently ordered, lest the Irish vvho vvere

swords, if they had been placed on either flank
should haue beene exposed to the fury of the Scotch
Horse.</p>
               <p>Montrose <hi>had sent unto the Commanders of the
enemy,</hi> Drummond <hi>sonne and heire to the Lord</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derty,
<hi>a noble Gentleman, and accomplished with
all kinde of vertues, who declared in his name,</hi> That
<hi>Montrose,</hi> aswell as the Kings Majesty from whom he had
received his Commission, was most tender of shedding his
Countreyes bloud, and had nothing more in his devotions,
then that his victories might he written without a red Letter.

he desired was, that in the name of God they would
at length give eare to sound counsell, and submit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
and what belonged unto them unto them grace and
protection of so good a King: who as he had hitherto
condescended unto all things (either for matter of Religion or
anything else) which they thought good to aske, though to
the exceeding great prejudice of his Prerogative; so still
they might finde him like an indulgent Father ready to embrace
his penitent children in his armes, although he had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
with unspeakable injuries. But if they should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
still obstinate in their Rebellion, he called God to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
that it was their own stubbornesse that forced him to
the present encounter.</p>
               <p>The Commanders of the enemies answered no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all to all this, but against the Law of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:33308:33"/>
sent the Messenger (who out of meere love to his
Countrey had undertaken the employment) prisoner
with a company of rude souldiers unto <hi>Perth,</hi> vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
assoone as they had got the victory to cut off his
head. But God was more mercifull to him, and
provided otherwise then they intended, for the safety
of that gallant man.</p>
               <p>They were come within musket shot when the
enemies under the Command of the Lord <hi>Drummond</hi>
sent out a forlorne-hope to provoke <hi>Montrose</hi> to a
light skirmish: he sends a few to meet them, who at
the first onset disorder and rout them, sending them
backe to their maine body in no small fright. <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trose</hi>
thought now was his opportunity, and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
could conduce more either to the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his owne souldiers, or the terrour of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
then immediately to fall upon them as they were
disordered and astonished with that fresh blow, nor
would he give them time to rally or recover courage:
therefore se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ting up a great shout, he lets loose his
whole Army upon them. The enemy first at distance
discharge their Ordnance, which made more noise
then they did harme, afterwards marching forward,
their Horse labour to breake in upon <hi>Montrose's</hi> Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers;
those when their powder was spent, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them had neither Pikes nor scarse Swords, they
stoutly entertaine with such weapons as the place
would afford, good stones; of which they poured in
such number amongst them with so great strength and
courage, that they forced them to retreat and to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
them no more. For the Irish and Highlanders

striving bravely whet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

valour, bore up so eagerly when they gave ground,
that at last they betooke themselves to the nimble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of their Horses heeles. There was something
more to do a little while longer in the right Flanke.
Sir <hi>Iames Scot</hi> disputed some time for the higher
ground, but <hi>Montrose's</hi> men being stronger bodied, &amp;
especially swifter footmen obtained the Hill; from
thence the <hi>Athole</hi> me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> rushed downe with their drawne
swords upon the enemy, and making little account of
the musquetiers, who sent their bullets amongst them
as thicke as haile, closing with them (as they lik't best
to fight) they slash't and beat them downe. At last
the enemy not able to abide their fury, fairely ran
away. Most of the Horse made so good speed as to
save themselves; but there was a great slaughter of
the Foot, whom they pursued for six or seven miles.
There were conceived to be two thousand of the
Covenanters slain, and more were taken prisoners;
of whom some taking a Military Oath, took up arms
again with the Conquerour; but perfidiously, for
almost all forsooke him afterwards. The rest taking
a solemn Protestation that they would never after
beare armes against the King, he set at liberty. He
tooke in <hi>Perth</hi> the same day, without doing the least
harme unto the City, although most of the
Citizens had fought against him in this battell;

hearts of the people towards their King, vvhich

<hi>Montrose,</hi> and in regard of the great power he had
with <hi>Kilpontin,</hi> he conceived he might draw him in to
be accessary to the villany, therefore taking him aside
into a private place, he had discovered unto him his
intentions; which the Nobleman highly detested, as
was meet; where upon the murtherer fearing he
would discover him, assaulted him unawares, &amp; stab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
him with many wounds, who little suspected any
harme from his friend and creature. The treacherous
assassine by killing a Centinel escaped, none being able
to pursue him, it being so darke that they could scarse
see the ends of their Pikes. Some say the traitor was
hired by the Covenanters to doe this, others onely
that he was promised a reward if he did it. Howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever

advanced him (though he was no souldier) to
great commands in his Army. <hi>Montrose</hi> was very
much troubled with the losse of this Nobleman, his
deare friend, and one that had deserved very well both
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> the King &amp; himself, a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> famous for arts &amp; armes,

of its inhabitants, and having a Garrison out of
<hi>Fife</hi> beside, refused to submit. And he, thinking it
no wisdome to hazard the honour he had gotten by
his late victory upon the doubtfull successe of a siege,
turnes away toward <hi>Eske;</hi> for he hoped that many of
his friends and kindred, being men of greatest note in
those parts, and who used to talke as highly what they
would doe for the King as any others, would be
ready to joyne with him.</p>
               <p>But they having newes of his approach withdrew
themselves: onely the Lord <hi>Ogleby Airley,</hi> a man of
threescore yeares old, (with his two sons, Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi>
and Sir <hi>David,</hi> and some of his friends and clients,
men of experienced resolutions) joyned himselfe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him: and with admirable constancy he went along
with him through all fortunes unto the very end of
the Warre; being in that almost universall defection,
the other honour and ornament of the Nobility of
<hi>Scotland</hi> besides <hi>Montrose.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>While <hi>Montrose</hi> was hereabouts, he receives intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
that some Commissioners from the Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
(of whom the Lord <hi>Burghly</hi> was the principall) lay
at <hi>Aberdene</hi> with an Army, and laboured to assure
unto themselves the Northerne parts, upon which
<hi>Montrose</hi> especially relyed, either by faire meanes or
foule. He determines to fight these immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Argyle</hi> could come up to them, therefore with
long marches he hies thither; and possessing himselfe
of the bridge upon the river of <hi>Dee,</hi> and drawing neare
the City, he found the enemy drawn up close beside
it. <hi>Burghley</hi> commanded two thousand Foot, and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:33308:37"/>
five hundred Horse whom he placed in wings; &amp; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

gone to convey their Lords dead body to his parents,
and most of the <hi>Athole</hi> men after the victory of <hi>Perth</hi>
were gone home, from whence they were not farre,
laden with spoile,) and just foure and forty Horse, of
whom he made two divisions, and mixing amongst
them the best fire-men and Archers that he had (who

prevent the falling of the enemies Horse upon his
rere; which they performed most gallantly beyond
the opinion or perhaps the beliefe of many.</p>
               <p>He gave the command of the right flank to <hi>Iames
Hay</hi> and <hi>Nathaniel Gordon,</hi> and of the left to Sir <hi>William
Rollock,</hi> all valiant men. The left wing of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my

but haire brain'd and one that had forced out
his fathers friends and clients to fight with <hi>Montrose</hi>
against their wills. He having gotten the plaine and
most commodious ground for fighting on horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe
charged <hi>Montrose's</hi> right flank: which when
he perceived, he commanded <hi>Rollock</hi> with his twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Horse to their aid; and they, being backed with
the gallantry of their Commanders, and the activity
and stoutnesse of the Foot amongst them, received
the charge with so much hardinesse, that they foure
and forty beat backe full three hundred of the enemy
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:33308:37"/>
routing all and killing very many. But because they
were so few they durst not follow the chase: which
was forborne by the great prudence of the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and proved to be of great consequence towards
the obtaining of the victory: for the enemy charged
<hi>Montrose's</hi> left Flanke vvhich had no Horse vvith their
right Wing of Horse. <hi>Montrose</hi> therefore in atrice
(now that <hi>Lewis Gordon</hi> and his men vvere fled) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighs
the same Horse to the left Flanke; vvho seeing
they vvere not able to dravv themselves into a Body
like the enemies, fetch't a compasse about, &amp; so esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
their first charge; then neatly vvheeling about
they fall upon the Flanke of the enemy, &amp; vvith their
naked svvords, beat, and cut, and vanquish, and put
them to flight. They tooke prisoners on <hi>Forbes</hi> of
<hi>Kragevar,</hi> a Knight of great esteem vvith the enemy,
and another <hi>Forbes</hi> of <hi>Boindle.</hi> Those that retreated got
safe away, because that so few could not safely persue
them. They that commanded the enemies Horse
vvere not so much frighted vvith their losse as vexed
vvith the disgrace of a double repulse, therefore impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

               <p>VVe doe no good (my fellow Souldiers) while we dispute the

about them with your Swords and butt-end of your Muskets, beat

               <p>It was not sooner said, then they fall to worke,
breake in upon the Enemy, defeate them, rout them.
Their Horse who expected Foot to come and line
them, seeing them all run away, ran faster then they:
whom the conquerours were not able to follow much
lesse to overtake, so they scap't scot-free; but the Foot
paid for all, few of which escaped the Victors hands.
For having no other place to fly unto but into the
City, <hi>Montrose's</hi> me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> came in thronging amongst them
through the gates and posternes, and laid them on
heaps all over the streets. They fought foure houres
upon such equall termes, that it was an even lay whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had the oddes. At this Battell <hi>Montrose</hi> had some
great Guns, but they were unserviceable, because all
advantages of ground were possessed by the enemy;
but the enemies Guns made no small havock of his
men. Among others, there was an Irishman that had
his legge shot off with a Cannon bullet, onely it hung
by a little skin; he seeing his fellow-souldiers some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
sad at his mischance, with a loud and cheerfull
voyce cryes out, <hi>Come on, my Camerades, this is but the
fortune of Warre, and neither you nor I have reason to be

sorry for it. Doe you stand to it as becomes you, and as for
me, I am sure my Lord Marquesse, seeing I can no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

out his knife, being nothing altered nor troubled,
he cut asunder the skin with his owne hand, and gave
his legge to one of his fellow-souldiers to bury. And
truly when he was well againe, and made a Trooper,
he often did very faithfull and gallant service. This
battell was fought at <hi>Aberdene</hi> on the twelfth day of
<hi>September,</hi> 1644. Then <hi>Montrose</hi> calling his souldiers
back to their Colours entered the City, and allowed

the Kings cause. From thence he sends Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam

the good successe he had hitherto obtained, and to
desire supplies out of <hi>England</hi> or some place else.</p>
               <p>That he had fought twice indeed very prosperously, but it
could not be expected that seeing he was so beset on all sides

And there wanted not some of them, who testified
their great affection to the service, but that <hi>Huntley</hi> the
Chief of the Family, being a backe-Friend to <hi>Montro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se,</hi>
had with held them all, either by his owne exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,

little reckoning. Therefore he hid his Ordnance in

carriages. And coming to the side of the River of <hi>Spey,</hi>

               <p>On the other side of the <hi>Spey,</hi> he findes the men o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to the number of five thousand up in Armes to
hinder his passage over the swiftest River in all <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
till such time as <hi>Argyle</hi> who marched after him
was upon his backe. Being oppressed, and as it were
besieged with so many enemies on every side, that
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:33308:39"/>
at least he might save himselfe from their Horse, he
turned into <hi>Badenoth,</hi> a rocky and mountainous Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
and scarce passable for Horse. There for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
dayes he was very sicke, which occasioned so
immoderate joy to the Covenanters, that they doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
not to give out he was quite dead, and to ordaine
a day of publique Thankesgiving to Almighty God
for that great deliverance. Nor were their Levites you
may be sure backward in that employment in their
Pulpits; for as if they had been of counsell at the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,
and stood by at the execution, they assured the
people that it was as true as Gospell, that the Lord of
Hostes had slaine <hi>Montrose</hi> with his owne hands. But
this joy did not last them long, for he recovered in a
short space; and as if he had been risen from the dead,
he frighted his Enemies much more then he had done
before. For assoon as his disease would give him leave,
he returned into <hi>Athole,</hi> and sent away <hi>Mac-donell</hi> with
a party unto the Highlanders, to invite them to take
up Armes with him; and if they would not be invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to force them. He himselfe goes into <hi>Angus,</hi>
hoping it might happen that he should either force
<hi>Argyle</hi> with his tyred Horse unto his Winter quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
or at least leave him farre enough behinde him.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Argyle</hi> had pursued him so slowly, and at such
distance, that it was appare<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>t he thought of nothing
lesse then of giving him Battell. Therefore going
through <hi>Angus,</hi> &amp; getting over the <hi>Grainsbaine</hi> (which
going along with a perpetual ridge from East to West,
divideth <hi>Scotland</hi> into two equall parts) he returned
into the North of the Kingdome. And now that
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:33308:40"/>
he had left <hi>Argyle</hi> so farre behinde him, that he might
safely take some time to recruit, he went to <hi>Strathbogy,</hi>
that he might meet with the <hi>Gordons,</hi> &amp; perswade them
to engage with him. But he lost his labour, for they
were forestalled by <hi>Huntley,</hi> and after his example plaid
least in sight. For such as were generous &amp; daring spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
though they were loath to provoke the indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their Chief, yet they could not but be ashamed,
that at a time when there might be so much use of
them they did nothing. Besides the Lord <hi>Gordon,
Huntley's</hi> eldest sonne (a man of singular worth and
accomplishment) was detained by <hi>Argyle</hi> his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ncle
by the Mothers side: the Earle of <hi>Aboine</hi> the second
Son was inclosed within the siege of <hi>Carlisle</hi> and <hi>Lewes</hi>
another Son was of the Enemies side; so that there
was no one of <hi>Huntley's</hi> family under whose authority
they should take up Armes.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding <hi>Montrose</hi> quartered there a great
while; in which time almost every other night mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
seven, or eight, or ten miles with a party of light
Foot (for Horse he had few or none) he used to give
Alarmes to the Enemy, beat up their quarters, put
them to flight, and frequently to bring home Horse
and Men Prisoners. And because he alwayes brought
his men safe off, it was strange to see how cheerfull &amp;
daring his Souldiers were; so that though their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
was not great, there was nothing that he would
lead them on unto that seemed great to them. At last
when he despaired of any good to be done with the
<hi>Gordons,</hi> at the end of <hi>October</hi> he removed from <hi>Starth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bogy,</hi>
and came to <hi>Faivy</hi> Castle and possest it. There he
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:33308:40"/>
was like to have been utterly undone by the bad and
false intelligence his scouts in whom he put great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
brought unto him concerning the Enemy:
for those whom they perswaded him were scarce got
over <hi>Grainsbaine</hi> were on a sudden encamped within
two miles of him. <hi>Argyle</hi> and <hi>Lothian</hi> had there two
thousand five hundred Foot, &amp; twelve hundred Horse
<hi>Montrose,</hi> now when <hi>Mac-donell</hi> was absent with a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
had fifteen hundred Foot and about fifty Horse.
If he should have descended into the Plain with so
small strength it had been madnesse; and to keep a
Castle (and no strong one neither) he thought disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable,
and derogatory to the credit of his late
victories. Therefore he bethought himself of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
course, he drawes his Men up unto a higher hill
vvhich over-look't the Castle. The soile of the Hill
vvas rough, and there vvere hedges also and ditches
cast up there by the Husbandmen for the sences of
their Fields, vvhich vvere almost as usefull as Breast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvorks.
But before he had appointed every one his
ground to dravv up in, those fevv of <hi>Huntley's</hi> depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants
vvhich accompanied <hi>Montrose</hi> from <hi>Strathbogy,</hi>
in the sight of all people fairly betooke them to their
heels. And on the other side, the Enemy driving fier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cely
up the Hill, made themselves masters of no small
part of it; vvhich if they had been able to maintaine
vvith the same vigour that they had obtained it, <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trose</hi>
had been a lost man: vvhose Souldiers, discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
both by the timorous flight of some of their
owne, and the multitude of their Enemies forces,
were wel neare ready to turne their backs; them <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trose</hi>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:33308:41"/>
presently put life and courage into by his ovvn
example and presence, by putting them in minde of
their former atchievements, and their ovvne sence of
their vvonted provvesse. Moreover he thus bespake
a young Irish Gentleman, one Colonell <hi>O Kyan, Go
thy way, O Kyan with such men as thou hast at hand, and
drive me those fellows out of yonder Ditches that we may be
no more troubled with them.</hi> The gallantry of <hi>O Kyan Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trose</hi>
had often seen and commended, nor did that
truly valiant Man deceive the Generalls opinion of
him; for he quickly ferretted the Enemy out of the
Ditches, though they much out-numbred his men,
and vvere seconded vvith a party of Horse. And not
onely so, but gained some bagges of Povvder vvhich
the Enemy had left behinde them for haste, a very
seasonable pray, of vvhich they had great need. Nor
doth a notable example of the forwardnesse of the
Souldiers seem to me unvvorthy in this place to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred;
for one of them looking upon the bagges
of Povvder, <hi>What</hi> (saith he) <hi>have they given us no Bullets?
Mary but we must fetch Bullets too from those sparing distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of Ammunition.</hi> As if it had been altogether the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
duty to provide the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> necessaries for the Warre.</p>
               <p>In the meane time his Horse (which were but fifty)
being disposed in a place of danger, he timely secured
them by lining them with Musketiers. For <hi>Lothain</hi>
charged them with five whole troops, who before
they had crossed over half a Field that lay between
them, being scared with our shot wheel'd about, and
returned to the place from whence they came. <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trose's</hi>
men being encouraged with these two successes
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:33308:41"/>
could hardly be kept of from falling on with a shout
upon the whole body of the Enemy: whom <hi>Montrose</hi>
refraines rather with a kind of commendatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> of them
(as was meet) then reproof, only bids every one
know his own duty and vvait his commands. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
night. <hi>Argyle</hi> having done nothing to any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
retreats two miles off, and slept not that
night. But the next day, vvhen he vvas told that
<hi>Montrose's</hi> Souldiers had great scarcity of Powder and
Bullet, drawing his men into the same ground againe,
he made as though he vvould have charged up the hill
and beaten <hi>Montrose</hi> out of his hold. But vvhen his
heart failed him in that enterprise, besides some skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes
between small parties while the main bodies
kept their ground, there vvas nothing done that day
neither. All this while <hi>Montrose</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ends for all dishes,
and flaggons, and chamber-pots, and what other pew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
vessels could be had, and caused them to be melted
into Bullet; yet when that was done the Souldiers had
not enough. With which great inconvenience the
Souldiers were so little troubled, that one as often as
he made a shot (which he presumed never missed) he
would say merrily to his Camerades. <hi>As sure as can be
I have broken one Traytors face with a Chamber-Pot.</hi> Nor
wil any one wonder if <hi>Montrose's</hi> men were oft in want
of Powder and other necessaries for Warre, when he
considers they had no other vvay to supply themselves
vvith them, but out of their Enemies stocke. And
novv the second day being almost spent, <hi>Argyle</hi> vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawes
his men over the river, the way that they came
three Scotch miles (vvhich make sone dutch mile) off.
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:33308:42"/>
The time was thus spent at <hi>Faivy</hi> for severall dayes,
<hi>Argyle</hi> carrying nothing away with that great Army,
but disgrace among his friends, and contempt among
his enemies; for it was wholly imputed to his cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise
that there he had not made an absolute conquest.</p>
               <p>At last <hi>Montrose</hi> (least by marching away in the day

                  </gap>agginesse of the Countrey
was a good security to his Souldiers against the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursions
of the Enemies Horse; and because it was
near those places from vvhence he dayly expected
<hi>Mac-donell</hi> with vvhat Highlanders he could raise.
The next day the Enemy pursues him vvith an intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to force him to fight vvith them in the open Field:
and truly assoone as they came in sight of them, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up their Men they made ready to Battell, as if they
would have fallen on with all their Power. But a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne
hope of Highlanders was sent before by <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyle</hi>
to engage <hi>Montrose</hi> in a light skirmish, who were
manfully entertained and repulsed. Then <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trose</hi>
having possessed himselfe of the highest ground,
<hi>Argyle</hi> alters his resolution, &amp; thinkes upon that which
was more safe and lesse honourable.</p>
               <p>He desires a Cessation, proposes that engagements
may be given on both sides for a Conference &amp; Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
yet at the same time, he did not onely tempt the
Souldiers to forsake <hi>Montrose</hi> by promising them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnity
&amp; rewards to boot; but (which is a shame to
say even of an enemy) set a great price upon <hi>Montrose's</hi>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:33308:42"/>
head, to be paid unto any assassine or murtherer that
should bring it in. Of which, when <hi>Montrose</hi> was
well assurred, (who well knew the disposition of the
man to be more bent to overreach and betray, then to
fight with his enemy) he thought nothing concerned
him more, then with all speed to bring of those small
Forces he had as farre as he could, both from <hi>Argyle's</hi>
Hose and knavery.</p>
               <p>Therefore calling a counsell of Warre, he declares
his opinion, they all aprove his wisdome, and promise
to continue their fidelity and their best endeavours to
serve him. Therefore he resolveth upon a long march
the next night, as farre as <hi>Badenoth;</hi> and that the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
might be lighter for so great a journey, he sent
the Carriages before with a guard, &amp; bid the souldiers
make themselves ready against the next day, as if they
were to fight. And now the Carriages were on the
way, when on a sudden newes came that <hi>Forbes</hi> of <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaver,</hi>
a prisoner (to whom upon the engagement of
his Honour for his true imprisonment <hi>Montrose</hi> had
given the liberty of the Camp) and that <hi>Sibbalds,</hi> who
besides <hi>Rollock</hi> was onely of his counsell and company
when he came out of <hi>England,</hi> and some others, had
made an escape an run away to the enemy. He was
troubled at the perfidiousnesse of the men, and justly
suspected that they, to ingratiate themselves with the
enemy, would betray his counsells. Therefore he
straight called bake the Convoy with the Carriages, &amp;
seemed as if he had wholly altered his resolutions.
But indeed he altered them not, but thought it fit to
delay them for a time, that the intelligence which the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:33308:43"/>
Enemy received from his fugitives might appear unto
them idle and uncertain. But after four dayes he sent
the Carriages away again before him, &amp; making fires
through all the Camp, he placed all the Horse he had
vvithin view of the Enemy, as if they kept their guard
there, till such time as the Foot vvere marched farre e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
from danger and then brought the Horse also
safe off, and all by break of day came to <hi>Balveny.</hi> And
novv being safe from having their quarters beaten up
by the Enemies Horse, and they no further pursuing,
it being also the very deep of vvinter he allovved a
fevv dayes unto the refreshment of his Souldiers.
And at this time especially <hi>Argyle</hi> began to appear in
his owne Colours and his subtilties vvere manifested.
For most of the Noblemen, Gentlemen, &amp; prime soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
that were vvith <hi>Montrose</hi> (vvho setting aside Irish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and Highlanders, had more Commanders then
private Souldiers in his Army) deserted him, and fell
off to <hi>Argyle.</hi> Some of them pretended sicknesse,
others disability to make such long marches in winter
time overmountains uninhabited, unpassable, full of
nothing but stones &amp; bryars, for the most part deep in
snow, and never travelled over by any man alive. And
therefore sore against their wills, as they said, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
compelled to depart by an extream necessity, they
disired his Passe: which he denyed to none that ask't;
but yet look't upon them rather with a kinde of indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
&amp; scorn, then approbation or compassion.</p>
               <p>Nor can one easily say how much the example of
such me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> weakened his Forces, &amp; howmuch it disheart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
many that intended to have listed themselves
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:33308:43"/>
under his Command. But the old Lord <hi>Ogleby</hi> the

                  <hi>MOntrose</hi> returning from <hi>Balveny</hi> to <hi>Badenoth</hi> met a
very faithful intelligencer, who gave him notice
that <hi>Argyle</hi> with his Foot (for his Horse were gone to
their Winter quarters) lay at <hi>Dunkeldon,</hi> and that from
thence he used all his industry to perswade the <hi>Athole</hi>

But he being frighted with the report of his coming,
when <hi>Montrose</hi> was yet sixteen Miles off, bid his men

                  <hi>Being recruited with these, he marcheth to the lake
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:33308:44"/>
of which the river of</hi> Tay <hi>breaks forth, to passe from
thence through</hi> Bradalbaine <hi>into the Country of</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyle;
<hi>for he thought an enemy could never be so hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
overthrown as in his own Countrey. And truly
he had many strong reasons for that resolution.</hi> In the
first place, <hi>Argyle's</hi> power and authority among the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers
rendered him formidable to his Peers and neighbours<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
and so conduced much both to raise and foment the whole Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion:
For assoon as any one adventured to oppose the Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
or dispute their Commands, presently <hi>Argyle</hi> gathering
a tumultuous army of five or six thousand Highlanders (who
for all that served him against their wils) crush't him to pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
and therefore he had all the reason in the world to bring
down the power of so seditious, and covetous, and cruell a man.
Moreover, those Highlanders who did not only favour the
Kings cause, but hated <hi>Argyle</hi> heartily, as having had suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t
experience of his Tyranny, durst not appeare as they would
till he was first subdued. And lastly, the Low-lands of the
Kingdome were maintained by the Covenanters with strong
Garrisons, and great bodies of Horse<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> so that except he had a
minde utterly to undoe his friends, he had no other place to win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his Souldiers in but that. <hi>And</hi> being pressed with these
reasons, with long and foule journeys, and incredible speed
he cometh into <hi>Argyle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Earl at that time was listing souldiers in his
Country, and had appointed the day and place for a
Rendezvouz. He lived securely in the Castle of <hi>Inne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rare,</hi>
supposing no enemy to be within a hundred miles
of him. For he could never before be brought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
that an Army could get into <hi>Argyle</hi> on foot in the
midst of summer, &amp; many times heretofore he has be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

heard to bragge, that he had rather lose a hundred thou
sand Crownes, then any mortall man should know
the way by which an Army could enter into his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.
When he therefore suspected nothing lesse, the
trembling Cow-herds came downe from the hills, &amp;
told him the enemy was within two miles, He not
knowing what to do, and almost besides himself for
fear, at last commits himself to a fisher-boat, and flies
away; leaving his friends, and servants, and the whole
Countrey to their fortunes, and the mercy of an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.

commodious for pasture, the chief riches of the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants

into three Brigades, and sends the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> about the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey;
one Brigade was commanded by the Chief of
the <hi>Mac-renalds,</hi> another by <hi>Mac-donel,</hi> and the third
by himself. They range about all the Country, and lay
it waste; as many as they finde in armes going to the
Rendezvous appointed by their Lord they slay, and
spare no man that was fit for warre: nor do they give
over till they had driven al serviceable men out of that
Territory, or at least into holes knowne to none but
themselves. Then they fire the villages and Cottes, &amp;
lay them levell with the ground: in that retaliating
<hi>Argyle</hi> with the same measure he had meted unto
others, who was the first in all the Kingdome that
prosecuted his Country-men with fire and sword.
Lastly, they drive their cattell. Nor did they deal more

(and one of whom he had entertained a better opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
with the Garrison of <hi>Innernesse</hi> which were old Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
&amp; the whole strength of <hi>Murray, Rosse, Sutherland,
Cathnes,</hi> and the sept of the <hi>Frasers,</hi> were ready to meet
him with a desperate army of five thousand Horse and
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:33308:45"/>
Foot. <hi>Montrose</hi> had only fifteen hundred, for those of
<hi>Clanrenald,</hi> and most of the <hi>Atholemen</hi> suspecting no such
need of them, &amp; being laden with the spoils of <hi>Argyle,</hi>
had got leave to go home on condition they should
return when they were sent for. But for al that <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trose</hi>
was not afraid to give battell to that disorderly
Army: for although he knew those of the Garrison
to be old Souldiers, yet he accounted of the rest of the
multitude (which were newly raised out of Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
Cow-herds, Pedees, Tavern-boyes, &amp; Kitchin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boyes)
to be altogether raw and unserviceable.</p>
               <p>And now while he thought of nothing but fighting
these, a trusty Messenger overtakes him, and informs
him, that <hi>Argyle</hi> having gathered forces out of the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
parts of the Kingdom, and joyned unto them such
Highlanders as yet adhered unto him, had come
down into <hi>Aber</hi> with three thousand Foot, and staid at
an old Castle called <hi>Innerlogh</hi> upon the bank of <hi>Logh-Aber.
Montrose</hi> who wel understood the crafty &amp; co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
dispositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> of <hi>Argyle,</hi> by that had a good guesse
at his designe; which was to follow after him at a good
distance, that he might be first engaged with those
Northern men, &amp; then to make his ovvn advantage of
the event of that battel, but by no means to fight him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
if he could help it. Therefore <hi>Montrose</hi> considered
that it vvould be a matter of greater concernment and
of lesse danger, to let men see that <hi>Argyle</hi> was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
even in the Highlands, vvere he was adored
by the simple people like some great little god: and as
for the Northern Army, he conceived that upon
the report of a Victory obtained against <hi>Argyle,</hi>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:33308:46"/>
it would moulder a way and easily be brought into
order. <hi>Montrose</hi> was thirty miles absent from <hi>Innerlogh,</hi>
neither would he goe the high way thither (though
he placed guards in it lest the enemy should have any
intelligence of his moving) but streight over <hi>Logh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Aber</hi>
hills, in untroden pathes, and onely know to
Cow-herds and Hunts-men, (for in those mountains
there are great herds of Deer) by a way that never

They being but little affrighted with so unexpected
an accident run to their arms, and immediately pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
themselves for battel. When <hi>Montrose</hi> perceived
them to be in a posture so quickly, he stood still a little
while till his Rear being tired with so hard a march
could come up unto his Front. It was night, but the
Moon shone so clearly that it was almost as light as
day: all night they stood to their arms, and making
frequent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>allies &amp; skirmishes one with another, neither
gave the other leave to rest or retreat. All others ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
expected day; only <hi>Argyle</hi> being more advised
then the rest conveied himself away at dead of the
night; and this second time taking boat saved himself
from the peril of battel, as if he intended to be Vmpire
between the two Armies being himself out of gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot
stand spectatour of other mens valour, &amp; wel too<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
At the break of day, <hi>Montrose</hi> ordered his men as he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to fight, and the enemy were as forward to do
the like. For they did not yet think that <hi>Montrose</hi> was
there (as some prisoners afterwards confessed) but
some Colonell or Captain of his with a party only of
his forces.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:33308:46"/>
When the Sun was up, on the second of <hi>February</hi>
(which is <hi>Candlemas</hi> day) a trumpet sounding struck
no small terrour into the enemy. For besides that a
trumpet shewed they had Horse with them, and
therefore was a sound with which those parts were
little acquainted, it discovered also that <hi>Montrose</hi>
himself was there. Neverthelesse the prime of the
<hi>Campbells</hi> (that 's the syrname of <hi>Argyle's</hi> family)
being gallant men and stout, and deserving to fight
under a better Chieftain in a better cause, cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
begin the battell, But their souldiers that were
in the Front having only once discharged their mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets,
and <hi>Montrose</hi>'s men pressing on fiercely to
come to the dint of sword began to run. Whom
they, raising a great shout, so eagerley pursued, that
as it were at one assault they routed them all; and had
the killing of them with a most horrible slaughter
for nine miles together. Of the enemy were slain
fifteen hundred, among whom were very many
Gentlemen of the <hi>Campbells,</hi> who where chief men
of the family, and of good account in their Country,
who fighting but too valiantly for their Chieftain,
had deaths answerable to their names, and fell in
<hi>Campo Belli,</hi> in the Field of War, [<hi>I cannot say the

lamented, and saved as many of them as hee
was able, taking them into his protection: whiles
<hi>Argyle</hi> himself being gotten into a boat and rowed
a little way off the shore, securely look't on whiles
his kindred and souldiers were knockt on the head.
Some Colonels and Captains that <hi>Argyle</hi> had brougt
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:33308:47"/>
thither out of the Low-lands fled into the Castle;
whom when the Castle was surrendred, and quarter
was given unto them, <hi>Montrose</hi> used courteously; and
after he had done them severall good offices of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity
&amp; charity, freely let them depart. In this fight
<hi>Montrose</hi> had many wounded, but none slain saving
three private souldiers: but the joy of this great vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
was much abated by the wounds of that truly
honourable Sir <hi>Thomas Ogleby,</hi> sonne to the Earl of
<hi>Airley,</hi> of which after a few dayes he dyed. He was
one of <hi>Montrose</hi>'s dearest friends; one who had done
very good service for the King in <hi>England</hi> under the
Command of his Father-inlaw the Lord <hi>Ruthien,</hi>
Earl of <hi>Forth</hi> and <hi>Braineford,</hi> (a man known all the
world over for his noble achievements.) Nor was
he lesse a scholler then a souldier, being a new orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the family of the <hi>Oglebyes,</hi> whose honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
deaths-wounds for his King and Country had
no small influence upon that dayes victory. <hi>Montrose</hi>

               <head>CHAP. IX.</head>
               <p>THe souldier who was almost spent with this
sore travell, having refreshed himself for a few
dayes, <hi>Montrose</hi> measuring over againe <hi>Logh-Aber</hi>
hills returneth to <hi>Logh-Nesse.</hi> And from thence
viewing by the way the coasts of <hi>Harrick, Arne,</hi>
and <hi>Narne,</hi> came to the river of <hi>Spey.</hi> Here he is
told that there was no small party of the enemy
at <hi>Elgin,</hi> (which is the chief town of <hi>Murray,</hi> a
Country beyond the <hi>Spey.) Montrose</hi> hies towards
these, either to draw them to his side or to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
them: but the very report of his advancing
blevv avvay that cloud, for they in great amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
shifted for themselves every one vvhither he
could. <hi>Montrose</hi> neverthelesse goes on his march,
and takes in <hi>Elgin</hi> by surrender on the 14. day of
<hi>February.</hi> At which time the Lord <hi>Gordon,</hi> eldest son
to the Marquesse of <hi>Huntley,</hi> (a man who can never
bee sufficiently commended for his excellent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments)
came off openly to the Kings side (from
his uncle by whom he had been detained against
his will) and with not many but very choise friends
and clients, voluntarily did his duty, and offered
his service to <hi>Montrose</hi> as the Kings Deputy and
Vicegerent. <hi>Montrose</hi> first welcomed him with
all civility, and gave him many thanks; afterwards
when hee came to understand him more inwardly;
joyned him unto himself in the entirest bonds
of friendship and affection. Now, because the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of <hi>Murray</hi> were extreamly addicted to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:33308:48"/>
the Convenanters, they hid themselves in their lur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
places, nor were any supplies to be expected
from men so maliciously disposed; Therefore he
drew his Forces to this side the <hi>Spey,</hi> to raise the
Countries of <hi>Bamph</hi> and <hi>Aberdene</hi> by the presence,
example, &amp; authority of the Lord <hi>Gordon.</hi> So having
got together what forces he could in those places,
with two thousand Foot and two hundred Horse,
passing the river of <hi>Dee</hi> he came into <hi>Marne,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped
not farre from <hi>Fettercarne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At <hi>Brechin</hi> some seven miles from thence, Sir <hi>Iohn
Hurray,</hi> a stout man and an active, and famous also
in forraigne parts for Military exploits, being Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
of the Horse for the Covenanters, had the
Command over the whole Forces there. Hee came
out with six hundred Horse to discover the strength
of <hi>Montrose:</hi> he conceived <hi>Montrose</hi> had but very
few Foot and no Horse, and if he should but
descend into the plain, hee made account to make
short work with him; and howsoever it should
happen, he made no question but to secure himself.
<hi>Montrose</hi> to draw him on, hid the rest of his men in a
bottome, and made shew only of his two hundred
horse, but lined them (as he used) with his nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest
Musquetiers. Which Horse when <hi>Hurrey</hi> saw,
and observed they were so few, he drew up his men
and charged. But when he perceived (too late) the
Foot that ran close after <hi>Montrose</hi>'s Horse, he soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
a retreat, and <hi>Hurrey</hi> himself turning his men
before him behaved himself stoutly in the rear.
When they turned their backs, <hi>Montrose</hi>'s souldiers
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:33308:48"/>
drive on, let fly, and lay about them, untill being
got over te river of <hi>Eske,</hi> the enemy scarce safe under
the protection of Night, betook themselves to shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
nor did they think themselves secure till after a
race of four and twenty miles long they came to
<hi>Dundee.</hi> Then they that had pursued them so far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to <hi>Fethercarne,</hi> and thence the next day to
<hi>Brechin.</hi> Here <hi>Montrose</hi> understod, that <hi>Batly</hi> a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
of great account had been fetched out of
<hi>England,</hi> to be Generall of the enemies Forces; that
<hi>Hurrey</hi> with his Horse was joyned unto him, and
that they had in their Army many olde souldiers
brought back out of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> so that
now the Covenanters going about their businesse in
so great sadnesse, <hi>Montrose</hi> must expect not only
other kind of souldiers, but also most expert Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
to deal with.</p>
               <p>Therefore, lest he should chance to be hemb'd in
with their Horse (in which their chief strength lay)
he chuseth his most convenient way by the foot of
<hi>Grainsbaine</hi> towards the river of <hi>Tay;</hi> intending
also if it were possible to get over the <hi>Forth,</hi> where
hee believed the King could not want assistance.
Which designe of his was not unknown to the
enemy: therefore they send these Commanders
against him with a powerfull Army; who no sooner
came in sight then <hi>Montrose</hi> offered them battell. But
they intended nothing lesse then to try it out with
him that way, nor would adventure so much as but
to fall upon the rear of <hi>Montrose</hi> as he marched off.
So he went to the Castle of <hi>Innercarity,</hi> and the next
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:33308:49"/>
day to a village called <hi>Eliot.</hi> And here again leaving
the mountains behinde him hee descends into the
plain, and by a Trumpet sends a challenge unto
<hi>Baily</hi> to fight. Between their two Armies ran the
river <hi>Ile,</hi> which neither could safely passe over with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the others consent. <hi>Montrose</hi> therefore desires
<hi>Baily</hi> to give him leave safely to come over to that
side; which motion if <hi>Baily</hi> should not like of, he
offered him a safe and free passage, on condition, that
he would engage his honour to fight without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
delay. <hi>Baily</hi> answered, he would look to his
own businesse himself, and would not have other
men teach him when to fight. Thus the two Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
fac't one another many dayes, neither the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
endeavouring to passe their Forces over the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
against <hi>Montrose,</hi> nor he hoping to make good
his passe unto them by reason of his scarcity of Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se.
Marching therefore to <hi>Dunkeldon,</hi> he thought
to passe the <hi>Tay,</hi> at which time by a sudden and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected
mischief he was almost utterly ruined. It
was thus, <hi>Lewis Cordon,</hi> sonne to Marquesse <hi>Huntly,</hi>
who had born arms against <hi>Montrose</hi> in the battell
of <hi>Aberdene,</hi> by the mediation of his noble bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Lord <hi>Gordon</hi> had bin received into favour.
He either by true or counterfeit letters from the old
fox in the hole, his father, tempred and carried away
with him almost all the <hi>Gordens</hi> without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of his brother; and basely deserted <hi>Montrose</hi>
and him when they were ready to be engaged with
the enemy. And truly it is hard to say to whether
of both he bore lesse good will.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:33308:49"/>
                  <hi>Montrose</hi> being sore afflicted with this unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
revolt, although he was of necessity to return
into the North to gather new Forces, yet made as if
neverthelesse hee went straight towards the <hi>Forth<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
                  </hi>
and his Scouts came all with full cry, that all the
enemy were got over the <hi>Tay,</hi> that by taking the
fords of the <hi>Forth</hi> they might hinder this passage.
Hee, lest he should seem all this while to have
done nothing, thought it wel worth his labour, if
by the way he could take in <hi>Dundee,</hi> a most seditious
town; for that being the securest haunt and recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of the Rebels in those parts, and a place that had
contributed as much as any other towards the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
was kept by no other garrison but of the
Townsmen. He therefore commanded the weakest
and worst armed men to go along by the bottom of
the hills and to meet him at <hi>Brechin:</hi> and he taking
with him what Horse he had (which were but one
hundred and fifty in all) and six hundred nimble mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetiers,
departing from <hi>Dunkelden</hi> about twelve of
the clock in the night, made so great haste that hee
came to <hi>Dundee</hi> by ten of the clock in the morning
on the 4. day of <hi>Aprill.</hi> He summons the Townsmen
to deliver the Town to the King, Which Was the
only vvay to preserve their ovvn lives and its safety;
if they would not they must expect fire and svvord.
They began to make delayes, and first to give no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>er
at all, aftervvard to commit the Trumpet to
prison. Which affront provoked <hi>Montrose</hi> so highly,
that hee stormed the Town in three places at once:
the Townsmen stood out a vvhile and maintained
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:33308:50"/>
their works, but they had as good have done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
for the Irish and Highlanders would take no
repulse, but with a resolute assault some beat them
out of their sconces, and possessing themselves of
their ordinance turned it against the Town; others
beat open the gates, and possesse themselves of the
Church and Market-place; and others set the Town
on fire in severall places. And indeed had not the
common souldiers by an unseasonable avarice and
intemperance addicted themselves to pillage that
rich Town had been immediately all on fire. But as
it happened it was better both for the conquerours
and the conquered that it was not, for all the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
that the Scouts had brought in concerning
the enemies coming over te <hi>Tay</hi> was absolutely false:
it may be they saw a few Troops (and many they
dit not see) passe over it, which they beleeved to
have been the wole body of the enemy, and by that
means were like to have undone both themselves
and the whole party.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montrose</hi> stood upon the top of a hil close unto
<hi>Dundee</hi> loocking upon this onslaught, when his
almost breathlesse Scouts brought him newes that
<hi>Baily</hi> and <hi>Hurrey</hi> with three thousand Foot and eight
hundred Horse were scarce a mile off. He imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
calls his men out of the Town, vvhich he
had much to do to perswade them; for the souldiers
counting themselves secure of the victory, and thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
they had done a good dayes work already, and
besides being a little heated in drink, and much ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
with so rich a booty, could hardly be brought to
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:33308:50"/>
leave the Town they had so newly taken. And truly
before they could be beaten off from the spoile, the
enemy was come within musket-shot of them.
And now (as it uses to happen in great dangers)
<hi>Montrose</hi>'s counsell of War were of different opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions;
some perswaded that <hi>Montrose</hi> should shift for
himself with te Horse he had, because they concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
it not possible that he should be able to bring off
the Foot, who had been wearied with a march of
above twenty miles in the morning, after that where
spent in a hot fight at noon, and now were over-loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
either with drink or prey; especially seing he was
to march twenty or perhaps thirty miles from <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee</hi>
before they could rest in safety. That this was
the fortune of War, and to be patiently undergone,
especially since he had given oft times far greater
overthrowes to the enemy then this could be to
him. That there was no doubt, but that as long as he
was safe, his forces might be easily recruited; and on
the other side if he miscaried, the case was desperate
and they were utterly undone. Others cryed out,
that all was lost already, and there was nothing
left them but to die with honour; and therefore if
charging courageously they should break in amongst
the thickest of the enemy, no one could say but
that they fell gallantly. <hi>Montrose</hi> concurred with
neither of these; for he could never be brought
to forsake so good men as he had in the extramest
danger, and preferred an honourable death a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
his souldiers before dishonourable safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
But for all that, for men that were so much
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:33308:51"/>
out-numbred by them to run desperately upon the
enemy, and as it vvere to dash out their ovvn brains
against the stones, vvas the very last refuge, and not
hastily to be made use of; therefore as vve ought
not to tempt Almighty God by our ovvn vvretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesnesse
and negligence, so neither ought any va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant
man or good Christian despair of his assistance
in a just cause. Lastly, he exhorts every one to do his
ovvn part and referre the successe to God, and other
things to his ovvn care and industry.</p>
               <p>Immediately he sends out four hundred Foot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, and commands them, that as much as they
possibly could vvithout breaking their ranks they
should make all speed. Then he appoints two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
of the activest men he had to follovv them;
&amp; he vvith his Horse brings up the Rear. The Horse
trooped on in so open order, that if occasion vvere
they might have room enough to receive light mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetiers.
He believed the enemies Foot vvere not
able to overtake them; and if their Horse only
should charge them; (vvhich they vvould hardly
adventure to do) he conceived it vvas no matter of
extream difficulty to make their part good against
them: besides the Sun vvas ready to set, &amp; the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the night vvould be commodious for their
retreat. The enemy understanding the number of
them that vvent avvay first by some prisoners they
had taken, and after that by their ovvn vievv, assoon
as they savv they vvere disposed rather for a journey
then a battell, divide their Forces into tvvo parts
and so pursue them. Wherein their intention vvas
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:33308:51"/>
not only to fall upon their Rear and Flank at on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
but also to secure against them all passages up to
the Highlands: And their Commanders the more
to encourage their Souldiers to a hot pursuit, propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
twenty thousand Crownes to any one that could
bring in <hi>Montrose's</hi> head. And now the Van of the
enemies Horse began to close up unto the retrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
whereupon those good musquetiers that
lined <hi>Montrose's</hi> Horse welcomed one, and another,
and another of the forwardest of them with bullets
in their sides; with whose mischance the rest beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
more wary, abated of the eagernesse of their
pursuit. And <hi>Montrose</hi>'s souldiers when they saw
they had been too hard for the enemies Foot at a
march, and had got before them, taking heart and
courage they skirmished stoutly with their Horse,
untill the night parted the quarrell. And to rid them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
some way of the enemy, took their way
East-ward many miles by the seacoast, However
that was not their way, but to go North-ward
toward <hi>Grainsbaine,</hi> and so to deliver themselves from
their mischievous Horse. But <hi>Baily</hi> had laid the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
part of his Army between them and <hi>Grainsbaine</hi>
that there might be no place for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> to retreat unto.</p>
               <p>Therefore at the dead of the night when they were
not far from <hi>Aberbroth, Montrose</hi> commands his men
to make a stand a while. And long they stood not,
before he considering with himself that all wayes &amp;
passages straight into the Mountains might be laid
by the enemies Horse (&amp; he was not mistaken) co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
them to face about, and march South-west.
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:33308:52"/>
And by this art (though with intolerable pains)
he beguiled the Pursuers, whom that same night
he passed by; and then turning North-ward, by
the next morning at Sunrising passed over <hi>South-Eske</hi>
at a place not far from <hi>Careston</hi> Castle: and
from thence sent to <hi>Brechin</hi> to fetch those men
which he had there with the Carriages. But that had
not needed, for they upon the report of this expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
had provided for themselves better and more
timely, and had taken the Mountains. Whiles he
staid at <hi>Careston,</hi> the Scouts brought him word on
a sudden that the enemies Horse were in fight,
and their Foot being refresh't with victualls
and sleep, march't after them apace. <hi>Montrose</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
being now within three miles of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
was not much afraid of them, but his souldiers
who had not slept for three dayes and two nights,
but had all that while been either on their march,
or in fight, were overcome with so dead sleep
that they could hardly be raised without pricks
and wounds. The enemy being at last entertained
with a light skirmish suffered <hi>Montrose</hi> to possesse
himselfe of the bottom of the Mountains, and
having done nothing to the purpose retreated from
their vain pursuit. So he and his men came to <hi>Gleneske.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this was that so much talk'd of Expedition
of <hi>Dundee,</hi> infamous indeed for the mistake of the
Scouts, but as renowned as any for the valour, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy,
and undaunted resolution of the Generall:
and even admirable for the hardinesse of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier,
in encountering all extremities with patience,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:33308:52"/>
for for threescore miles together they had been
often in fight, alwayes upon their march, without
either meat, or the least refreshment. Which whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
forraigne Nations or after times will beleeve
I cannot tell, but I am sure I deliver nothing
but what is most certain of mine own knowledge.
And truly amongst expert Souldiers, and those of
eminent note both in <hi>England, Germany,</hi> and <hi>France,</hi>
I have not seldom heard this Expedition of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
before <hi>Montrose's</hi> greatest victories.</p>

bids the souldiers take their rest, whiles

He sends the Lord <hi>Cordon,</hi> together with those
that had continued loyall and dutifull after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt
of his brother <hi>Lewis</hi> into their own Country,
both that they might recall those whom his brother
had seduced away, and recruit themselves by levy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
new forces. Whic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> he cheerfully and coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geously
performed, and though he spared none, yet
he was most severe with those that had been au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours
or accessaries to his brothers defection: ad he
was the more active in that businesse, that he might
acquit himself of any suspition. Nor indeed did
<hi>Montrose</hi> himself or any other more detest that vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany
of <hi>Lewis Gordon</hi> then that noble Lord his brother.
As for <hi>Montrose,</hi> he with a small party (for he kept
but five hundred Foot and fifty Horse with him)
marches through <hi>Angus</hi> into <hi>Perthshire,</hi> that he might
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:33308:53"/>
distract the enemy till such time as hee made up his
Army with recruits from every side. Neither was
hee out in his aime, for the Covenanters had sent
<hi>Hurrey</hi> the Lieutenant Generall of the Horse with
a Command into the North, of a party of six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
old Foot, and two hundred Horse; that
he might strengthen their own side, and suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
the Lord <hi>Gordon.</hi> And <hi>Baily</hi> himself staid with
an Army at <hi>Perth,</hi> as in the very heart of the
Kingdome, ready to wait upon all motions. <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trose</hi>
was twelve miles off at a village called <hi>Kreif,</hi>
where <hi>Baily</hi> understood he quartered securely with
a very small party: who being diligent upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions,
set out from <hi>Perth</hi> at the beginning of the
night with all his Army, that by a speedy march he
might at break of day fall unexpected into <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trose</hi>'s
quarters. But hee found <hi>Montrose</hi> carefull
enough of his businesse, and his Foot ready in
armes either to march or fight; buth he with his
Horse came up towards the enemy to discover their
number and strength. And when he found them to
be two thousand Foot and five hundred Horse, hee
commanded his men to march speedily away, and
following the course of the river <hi>Erne</hi> to make good
the fords thereof: hee with the few Horse that hee
had was their Rear guard, lest they should have been
troden in pieces by the enemies Cavalry. And truly
he so valiantly repulsed the fierce assault of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
that by killing some and routing others he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
them to a retreat, till at last his Foot after six
miles march had made themselves masters of the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:33308:53"/>
passes of <hi>Erne.</hi> So the enemy retreated with the
losse of their labour, and <hi>Montrose</hi> that same night
being the 18. of <hi>Aprill,</hi> quartered at <hi>Logh-Erne,</hi> and
came the next day to <hi>Balwidir,</hi> where the Earl of
<hi>Aboine</hi> met him, who with some few more had esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
out of <hi>Carlisle,</hi> and hearing tydings of <hi>Montrose</hi>'s
good successe, had at last returned into his Country.</p>
               <p>Leaving <hi>Balwidir</hi> they advanced to <hi>Logh-Catrinet,</hi>
where they receive intelligence that <hi>Hurrey</hi> had rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
great forces in the North, and was ready to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
with the Lord <hi>Gordon;</hi> and therefore there
was danger that he being an active Souldier and a
good Commander should be able to over-master
that gallant young Gentleman. Therefore <hi>Montrose</hi>
thought it necessary to oppose <hi>Hurrey</hi> assoon as was
possible, as well to secure so dear a friend from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
danger, as to be nibbling at the enemies For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
as he found them asunder, and to cut off that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
by peace-meal which he vvell knew if it vvere

by long and continued journeys passing by <hi>Balwidir,</hi>
and a Lake of four and tvventy miles long, out of
vvhich the river of <hi>Tay</hi> breaks forth, through <hi>Athole</hi>

There he joyned vvith the Lord <hi>Gordon,</hi> vvho had

speed he had over-run the very report of
himself. <hi>Hurrey,</hi> lest a battell should be forced upon
him whether he would or no, before he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
an addition of numerous Auxiliaries, in all hast
passeth over the <hi>Spey.</hi> And because he had appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Rendezvouz of all his friends at <hi>Innernesse,</hi>
hyeth to <hi>Elgin;</hi> nor did <hi>Montrose</hi> pursue him lazily
to <hi>Elgine.</hi> Thence with all speed he passeth to <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resse,</hi>
nor did <hi>Montrose</hi> make lesse haste to follow
and overtake him too at <hi>Forresse,</hi> and sat so close
on his skirts for fourteen miles together, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
he had the advantage of te night, hee
had much adoe to reach <hi>Innernesse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next day <hi>Montrose</hi> incamped at a village cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Alderne:</hi> and <hi>Hurrey</hi> according to his hopes
found the Earls of <hi>Seafort</hi> and <hi>Suderland,</hi> the whole
sept of the <hi>Frasers,</hi> and most of <hi>Murray</hi> and <hi>Cath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi>
and the neighbouring parts to have assembled
themselves to <hi>Innernesse</hi> well appointed. To these
<hi>Hurrey</hi> ads some old souldiers of the Garrison of
that Town, and so drawes up against <hi>Montrose.</hi> He
now commanded three thousand and five hundred
Foot, and four hundred Horse; but <hi>Montrose</hi> (who
had no more but fifteen hundred Foot and two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Horse) had a great minde to retire. But not
only <hi>Hurrey</hi> pressed so vehemently upon him, that
it was scarce possible for him to retreat, but <hi>Baily</hi>
also vvith a Southern Army much stronger then
<hi>Hurrey</hi>'s (especially in Horse) was novv got al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
a great vvay on that side <hi>Gransbaine,</hi> and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
in great hast tovvards the <hi>Spey.</hi> What should
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:33308:54"/>
                  <hi>Montrose</hi> do in this condition? Hee must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
either give <hi>Hurrey</hi> battell, or undergo a far
greater hazard of being hemb'd in between two Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
Therefore he resolves to try the fortune of
War without delay, to commit the successe unto
God, and chusing the best advantage of ground hee
could finde, there to expect the assault of the enemy.
There was a little Town that stood upon the height
which shadowed the neighbouring valley; &amp; some
little hills that were higher then the Town behinde
it, that hindered the discovery of any one till they
were just upon him. In this valley he drawes up his
Forces out of the view of the enemy. Before the
Town he places a few but expert and choice Foot
with his Ordnance, who were sheltered with such
ditches as they found there. The right wing hee
commits to <hi>Alexander Mac-donel</hi> with four hundred
Foot, and lodged them in places fortified to their
hand with banks and ditches, with shrubs also and
great stones: and commands him to preserve himself
entire, that he might be a reserve upon all occasions,
and not to depart from his station which had so
good a naturall fence, that they might lie there safe
enough not only from the enemies Horse but Foot
also. And with the same good advice, he commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to his charge that notable Standard of the
Kings, which only he was wont to carry before him;
expecting that the enemy upon the sight of that
would order the best of their Forces against that
wing, which by reason of the disadvantage of the
place would be rendred wholly unusefull unto
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:33308:55"/>
them, till such time as hee on the left flank should
take his best advantage against them. And to
that end drawing the rest of his Forces to the
other side, hee commends the Horse to the Lord
<hi>Gordon,</hi> and takes charge of the Foot himself.
Those few that stood before the Town under the
shelter and covert of the banks and ditches seemed
as if they were his main battell, whereas indeed
hee had none. And for Reserves, in that scarcity
of men they were not to be thought of.</p>
               <p>The enemy (as <hi>Montrose</hi> most wisely fore saw)
assoon as they savv the Kings Standard ordered, the
most part of their Horse and old Souldiers (vvhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
their chief strength consisted) against that. And
by this time the Van of the enemy began to dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
it with those before the Town, and on the right
flank, and still as their souldiers were spent, drew up
fresh men; which <hi>Montrose</hi> because his number
was but few could not so easily do: therefore hee
resolved with all his men that he had on the left flank
to make a violent assault upon the enemy at once.
And whiles he was thinking so to do, there comes
unto him one whom hee knew to be trusty and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet,
and whispers him in the ear that <hi>Mac-donell</hi>
with his men on the right flank were put to flight.
He being a man of a quick spirit, thought it was best
to forestall the souldiers lest their hearts should faile
them upon bad newes, and cryes aloud to the Lord
<hi>Gordon, My Lord, what doe we doe?</hi> Mac-donell
<hi>upon the right hand having routed and discomfited the
enemy is upon the execution; shall wee stand by as
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:33308:55"/>
idle spectatours whiles hee carries away the honour of the
day?</hi> And with that hee commands them to char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge.
<hi>Hurrey</hi>'s Horse had no minde long to endure
the shock of the <hi>Gordons,</hi> but wheeling about and
beginning to run, left their flanks which they were
to maintain open to their enemies. Their Foot,
although thus deserted by their Horse, being both
more in number and better armed then <hi>Montrose</hi>'s
men, stood out very stoutly as longs as his men kept
aloof; but assoon as hee came to fall upon them
hand to hand, hee drove them to throw away their
arms, and to seek (though to little purpose) to save
themselves by their heels. But <hi>Montrose</hi> himself, not
forgetting what was signified unto him by so faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
a messenger, drew off with a few of his readiest
men unto the right flank, where hee found things in
a far other condition then they were left.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Mac-donell,</hi> being a valiant man, but better at
his hands then head, (being over-hasty in battell,
and bold even to rashnesse) disdaining to shelter
himself behinde hedges and shrubs whiles the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
vapoured and provoked him with ill language,
contrary to orders, upon his own head advanceth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the enemy out of that most defencible fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
&amp; station where in he was placed. And he did it
to his cost, for the enemy over-powering him both
in Horse and Foot, and having many old souldiers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, routed &amp; repulsed his men. And certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
if he had not timely drawn the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> off into a close hard
by, they had every one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> together with the Kings
Standard been lost. But hee made amends for that
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:33308:56"/>
rash mistake in his admirable courage in bringing
off his men, for he was the last man that came off;
and covering his body with a great target which he
carried in his left hand, defended himself against
the thickest of his enemies. Those that came closest
up unto him were Pike-men, who with many a
blow had struck their spear-heads into his target,
which he cut off by three or four at once with his
sword which he managed with his right hand. And
those that made him any opposition in the close,
seeing <hi>Montrose</hi> come in to his aid, and their own
men on the other side put to flight, such as were Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
spur'd away, and the Foot (most of which were
old souldiers out of <hi>Ireland</hi>) fighting desperately,
were almost all of them slain upon the ground. The
Conquerours pursued them that fled for some mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les;
so that there were slain about three thousand
Foot of the enemy, amongst whom their old soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
fought most stoutly; but almost all their Horse
escaped by a more timely then honourable flight.</p>
               <p>Nor had <hi>Hurrey</hi> himself with some of their best
men which went last off the field escaped the hands
of the pursuers, had not the Earl of <hi>Aboine</hi> by I know
not what want of heed, displayed some Ensignes
and Standards that had been taken from the enemy;
and himself not following the chase but turning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his own party, seemed to have been the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and to threaten a new battell. With which
mistake they were so long deluded, untill the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Horse, though much disordred, had shifted
themselves away into such by-paths as they knew
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:33308:56"/>
or could light upon: only a few of them came with
<hi>Hurrey</hi> before next morning to <hi>Innernesse.</hi> Of such
of the enemy as were slain, the most notable were
<hi>Cambell Laver</hi> a Colonell of old souldiers, Sir <hi>Iohn</hi>
and Sir <hi>Gideon Murray</hi> Knights, and other stout men,
and perhaps not unworthy to bee lamented, had
they not stained their otherwise commendable va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
with the horrid crime of Rebellion; nor in
that did they so much follow their own jugdements
as the humour of the times, or the ambition, or ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice
of their Chiefs. <hi>Montrose</hi> of those that served
with him on the left flank missed only one man, and
him a private souldier; and on that side where
<hi>Mac-donell</hi> commanded, there were missing four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
private souldiers also. But hee had many more
wounded, the curing and securing of whom was
especially provided for by <hi>Montrose.</hi> Afterwards
entertaining the prisoners with sweetnesse &amp; cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie,
hee promised all such as repented of their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
liberty or employment, and was as good as his
word; and such as were obstinate in their rebellion
he disposed of into severall prisons. In this battell at
<hi>Alderne</hi> the valour of young <hi>Napier</hi> did very much
discover it self; who being the son of the Lord <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier</hi>
of <hi>Marchiston,</hi> and <hi>Montrose</hi>'s nephew by his
sister, had but a little before without the knowledge
of his father, or wife, stoln away from <hi>Edinburgh</hi> to
his uncle, and did at this time give an excellent
assay of his valour, and laid down most firm princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of a most noble disposition. Whereupon the
chief of the Covenanters took his father, a man
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:33308:57"/>
almost threescore and ten years old (and as good a
man as ever <hi>Scotland</hi> bred in this age,) and his wife,
the daughter of the Earl of <hi>Marre,</hi> Sir <hi>Sterling Keer</hi> his
brother-inlaw (an excellent man also, chief of his
family, and one that had suffered very much for
his Loyalty) together with his two sisters, the one
Sir <hi>Sterlings</hi> most virtuous Lady, the other a virgin,
and cast them all into the dungeon; from whence
afterward they were to be delivered by <hi>Napier</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with the assistance of his uncle. This battell
was fought at <hi>Alderne</hi> on the 4. of <hi>May,</hi> 1645.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="11" type="chapter">

               <p>
                  <hi>MOntrose</hi> allowing a few dayes of refreshment
to his souldiers, marched to <hi>Elgin</hi> which is the
chief Town of the Province; where for the sake of
those that were wounded, hee made some longer
stay, because they had there the accommodation of
good Chyrurgeons and medicines, which are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
scarce to be had in the field. Afterward pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
over the <hi>Spey</hi> hee came to <hi>Keith,</hi> from thence to
<hi>Frendrackt,</hi> and so to <hi>Strathbogy.</hi> Here <hi>Baily</hi> meets
him (unto whom <hi>Hurrey</hi> with those that remained
of his broken Troops at <hi>Alderne</hi> was joyned) and
provokes him to battell. <hi>Montrose</hi> kept back his
men, who were spent with great travaile, and were
far fewer both in Horse and Foot, though very eager
to fight, till such time as he had raised new forces,
&amp; recruited them. Therefore thinking it enough to
maintain that ground which he had chosen as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiously
as he could for himself untill night, pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:33308:57"/>
then to <hi>Balvenie,</hi> whither also the enemy fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
him: but he passing by <hi>Strath Done</hi> &amp;. <hi>Strath-Spey,</hi>
went up to <hi>Badenoth.</hi> The enemy getting to the
other side of the water provokes him again to fight;
but in vain, for he was very wary of giving them a
set battell, but neverthelesse by frequent skirmishes,
and especially beating up quarters in the night,
did so much weaken their power and courage,
that they that were so haughtily daring but a whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
ago, as well Commanders as Souldiers, hastily
and disorderly betook themselves by night to <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nernesse</hi>
when none pursued them. <hi>Montrose</hi> was
not much displeased that hee was so rid of this
enemy, especially for this reason; the Earl of
<hi>Linesey,</hi> the prime ringleader of the Covenanters
next unto <hi>Argyle,</hi> and his rival too (as being brother-in-law
to Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi>) used to give out, that
<hi>Argyle</hi> wanted either care or courage; and howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it came to passe, was still unfortunate. And the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore
he took upon himself the command of that
Army which was newly raised, as if he would assay
to manage the businesse with better conduct. And
now he had passed over with his forces into <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi>
intending to be a Reserve unto <hi>Baily;</hi> and if any
thing should happen otherwise then wel, at the
worst hee was ready to hinder <hi>Montrose</hi>'s passage
over <hi>Forth.</hi> For they were alwayes very jealous lest
<hi>Montrose</hi> should remove the seat of Warre to this
side the <hi>Forth,</hi> and nearer <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> Therefore hee
resolved with all speed to quell <hi>Lindsey</hi> (who lay
yet in <hi>Angus</hi> at a Castle called <hi>Newtill</hi>) both
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:33308:58"/>
because the Generall was no souldier, and the soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
raw, and unacquainted with the hardship
of war.</p>
               <p>In pursuit of which designe, departing from <hi>Bade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noth</hi>
he marcheth through the plains of <hi>Marre</hi> over
<hi>Granshaine,</hi> and came by long and painfull journies
unto the coast of the river of <hi>Airley,</hi> intending to
surprise the enemy on a sudden: which was easie
to be done, for hee had made such hast, that the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes
of his approach was not so swift as himself.
And now <hi>Lindsey</hi> was not above seven miles from
him, and all things were ready for an assault, when
(upon what occasion it is uncertain) almost all the
Northern men privately ran away from their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours;
and going back the way that they came, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
into their Country. The Lord <hi>Gordon</hi> was in the
Camp, and there was none there that detested that
villany with greater indignation then he, in so much
that <hi>Montrose</hi> had much adoe to with-hold him from
putting such of the fugitives to death as had any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance
upon him. Some stick not to say, that
these men were inveigled away by the private dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of his father the Marquesse of <hi>Huntley</hi> to the
Earl of <hi>Aboine,</hi> who by reason of his sicknesse was
absent. For it vext <hi>Huntley,</hi> a haughty and envious
man, to hear of the successe of <hi>Montrose;</hi> nor could
he endure that inward frindship which was between
his eldest son and him. However it was, <hi>Montrose</hi>
being cast down with this unexpected misfortune,
was forced to put off that Expedition against <hi>Lind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sey,</hi>
and to suffer patiently so great and easie a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:33308:58"/>
to be taken out of his hands.</p>
               <p>Therefore taking up new resolutions, hee follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
after Colonell <hi>Nathaniel Gordon,</hi> a valiant man
and a trusty, and welbeloved in his Country, whom
he had sent before. And by this time <hi>Baily</hi> and
<hi>Hurrey</hi> had returned from <hi>Innernesse,</hi> and quartered
in lower <hi>Marre</hi> by the side of <hi>Dee.</hi> And <hi>Montrose</hi>
came by the coast of <hi>Eske,</hi> and the plains of <hi>Marre</hi>
into the heart of that Country, commonly called
<hi>Crommare.</hi> And whiles hee passed through those
plains aforesaid, hee dispatched <hi>Mac-donell</hi> with a
party into the furthest part of the Highlands, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
such Forces as were there raised with all speed
unto the Army. Afterward hee sent away the Lord
<hi>Gordon</hi> himself, to hasten and promote that levy of
men which <hi>Nathaniel Gordon</hi> was listing, by all the
power and interests hee had in those parts. Which
he most diligently performed, and amongst others,
brought his brother the Earl of <hi>Aboine</hi> back with
him. Whilest these things passed in <hi>Cromarre, Lindsey</hi>
joynes his Forces with <hi>Baily</hi> in lower <hi>Marre.</hi> With
whom <hi>Montrose</hi> finding himselfe unable to deal,
(the most part of his Forces being gone along with
the Lord <hi>Gordon</hi> and <hi>Mac-donell</hi>) hee stept aside to
the ruinated Castle of <hi>Kargarf,</hi> lest the enemy should
overlay him on the champaine grounds with their
multitudes both of Horse and Foot; but when hee
was close unto the Mountains he feared them not.
From hence <hi>Aboine</hi> falling sick again, betook himself
to <hi>Strathbogy;</hi> and upon pretence of a guard, carried
along with him a considerable number of Horse,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:33308:59"/>
whom his brother the Lord <hi>Gordon</hi> had much adoe
afterward to draw back to their colours. In the
mean time <hi>Lindsey</hi> took a thousand old Souldiers
from <hi>Baily,</hi> and gave him as many raw &amp; new rais'd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
for them; and as if hee intended to do some
famous exploit, returning through <hi>Merne</hi> into <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi>
with all the pains he took hee did only this,
he ranged with his Army up and down <hi>Athole,</hi> and
after hee had robbed and spoiled all the Countrey,
he set it on fire. In this imitating <hi>Argyle,</hi> who was
the first that in this age introduced that cruell and
dreadfull president of destroying houses and corn:
being better at fire then sword, when they came
into empty fields and towns unmann'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Baily</hi> at that time went to <hi>Bogy,</hi> to besiege the
fairest castle that belonged to the Marquesse of <hi>Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi>
and indeed of all the North; and in case he failed
to take it in, to waste and fire all the Country of
the <hi>Gordons</hi> thereabouts. <hi>Montrose</hi> (although <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donell</hi>
was absent with a greatparty) thought it
necessary to relieve <hi>Huntley</hi> and his friends, whom
he laboured to assure unto himself by all good offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and hied thither. Where having notice that
<hi>Baily's</hi> souldiers, though not all yet a great part,
were new rais'dmen (for he had parted with so many
old souldiers to <hi>Lindsey</hi>) desired nothing more then
without delay to fight him, and marcheth straight
towards him. Hee had not gone above three miles
before he discovered the enemies Scouts: He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
sent before some of his readiest men that knew
the wayes to view the strength, the rendezvouz
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:33308:59"/>
and the order of the enemy. They immediately
bring word, that the Foot stood on the top of a hill
some two miles off; and the Horse had possessed
themselves of a narrow and troublesome passe which
lay almost in the middle between the two Armies,
and were come on this side it. Against them <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trose</hi>
sent such Horse as he had in a readinesse, with
some nimble Firelocks, whom they first entertained
with light skirmishes afar-off, and after retreated
behinde the passe, which they had strongly man'd
with musquetiers. <hi>Montrose</hi> sends for the Foot, that
if it were possible they might dislodge the enemy
from thence; but it could not bee done, for they
were parted by the fall of the night, which both si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
passed over waking, and in their arms, The next
day <hi>Montrose</hi> sends a Trumpet to offer a set battell,
but <hi>Baily</hi> answers, hee would not receive orders
to fight from an enemy. Hee therefore seeing he
could not drive the enemy from those passes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
manifest losse and danger, that hee might
draw him out thence in some time, marcheth off
to <hi>Pithlurge,</hi> and from thence to a Castle of the
Lord <hi>Forbesis</hi> called <hi>Druminore,</hi> where he staid two
dayes. And at last hee understands the enemy had
quitted the passes, and was marching toward <hi>Strath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bogy;</hi>
so he at break of day sets forth towards a villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge
called <hi>Alford.</hi> But <hi>Baily</hi> when he had gotten cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
notice that <hi>Mac-donel</hi> with a considerable part
of those Forces was absent in the Highlands, hee
voluntarily pursues <hi>Montrose,</hi> conceiving him to
be stealing away, and about noon began to face him.
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:33308:60"/>
                  <hi>Montrose</hi> determines to wait for the enemy (who
as seemed to him came towards him) upon the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gher
ground: But <hi>Baily</hi> turning aside some three
miles to the left hand, <hi>Montrose</hi> holds on his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
march to <hi>Alford,</hi> where hee staid that night, the
enemy lying about four miles off.</p>
               <p>The next day after, <hi>Montrose</hi> commands his men
very early in the morning to stand to their armes,
and make ready to battell, and placed them on a
hill that stands over <hi>Alford.</hi> And as he with a Troop
of Horse was observing the motion and order of
the enemy, and viewing the fords of the <hi>Done,</hi> a river
which runs by <hi>Alford,</hi> it was told him that the
enemy, Horse and Foot, were making unto a ford
which lay a mile from <hi>Alford,</hi> to the intent that
they might cut off the Reare of their flying enemy;
for so those excellent Diviners prophesied to their
owne destruction. <hi>Montrose</hi> leaving that troop of
Horse not farre from the Ford, together with some
select and understanding men who should give him
perfect intelligence of all things, hee returneth alo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
to order the battell. And above all things he pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesses
himselfe of <hi>Alford</hi> hill, where hee might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the charge of the enemy if they fell on despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately.
Behinde him was a moorish place full of
ditches and pits, which would prevent Horse falling
upon his Reare: before him was a steep hill which
kept his men from the enemies view, so that they
could hardly perceive the formost rankes. Hee had
scarce given order for the right managing of all
things, when those Horse whom hee had left at the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:33308:60"/>
Ford returned with a full cariere, and bring word
that the enemy had passed the River. And now it
was no more safe for either of them to retreat with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the apparent ruine of their party. It is reported
that <hi>Baily,</hi> like a skilfull and wary Commaunder,
was sore against his will drawne unto this battell;
nor had engaged, had he not beene necessitated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it by the rashnesse of the Lord <hi>Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>carise,</hi> a Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell
of Horse; who precipitated himselfe and the
Horse under his command into that danger, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Baily</hi> would or no, as that hee could not be
brought off without the hazard of the whole Army.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montrose</hi> gave the command of his right wing (on
which side the enemies Horse were most strong)
unto the Lord <hi>Gordon;</hi> and appointed <hi>Nathaniel
Gordon,</hi> an old Commander to his assistance. The
command of the left wing was given to the Earle
of <hi>Aboine,</hi> to whom also was joyned Sir <hi>William
Rollock:</hi> And of the maine battell to two valiant men,
<hi>Glengar,</hi> and <hi>Drumond</hi> of <hi>Ball</hi> the younger, unto whom
hee added <hi>George Graham</hi> master of the Camp, an
expert souldier also. The Reserve, which was alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
hid behinde the hill, was commanded by his
nephew <hi>Napier.</hi> And for a while, <hi>Montrose</hi> kept him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
upon the height, and the enemy in the valley
being fortified with pits and ditches; for it was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
safe for the later to charge up the hill, nor for
the former to fall upon them that were surrounded
with marshes and pooles. The numbers of the Foot
were in a manner even, either side had about two
thousand: but <hi>Baily</hi> was much stronger in Horse, for
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:33308:61"/>
he had six hundred, and <hi>Montrose</hi> but two hundred
and fifty. Only <hi>Montrose</hi> had this advantage, that
the enemy were for the most part hirelings raised
from dunghills, but those that served the King,
Gentlemen, who fought for a good Cause and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
<hi>gratis,</hi> and not for gaine; and such as esteem'd
it more becoming to die then to be overcome. Besi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
<hi>Montrose</hi> knew that the greatest part of the old
souldiers were gone with <hi>Lindsey,</hi> and the new ones
would be so frighted with the shouts of the Armies,
and the noise of Trumpets, that they would scarce
stand the first charge. Therefore in confidence of so
just a cause, and so valiant assertors of it, he first drew
downe his men, and immediately the Lord <hi>Gordon</hi>
giving a smart charge upon them, was courageously
receiv'd by the enemy, who trusted to the multitude
of their Horse: and now being clos'd, and come to
handy blowes no one could advance a foot but over
his vanquished enemy; nor retreat by reason of the
pressing on of those in the Rear. The first that
made way for themselves and their men by a great
slaughter of their enemies were the two <hi>Gordons,</hi> the
Lord, and the Colonell; and Colonell <hi>Nathaniel</hi>
called out unto those expert Firelocks who now
lin'd the Horse as they were wont, <hi>Come on, my fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louw
sonldiers, throw downe your now uselesse guns, draw
your swords, and sheat them in the Rebells Horse; or
hamstring them.</hi> They instantly tooke the word
of command, and at the same time <hi>Montrose</hi> dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes
up <hi>Napier</hi> with his Reserve, which lay out
of sight on the other side of the hill; at whose
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:33308:61"/>
sudden and unexpected coming, the enemy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted,
betook himself to his heels. <hi>Aboine</hi> with
the left wing kept off, nor did hee attempt the
enemy but by light skirmishes in small parties:
who when they saw their own men on their left
wing routed and put to flight, made their retreat
with little losse. Their Foot being deserted by
their Horse, after they had desperately stood out
a while, and refused quarter, were almost all cut
off. The fall of the Lord <hi>Gordon</hi> was no little ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to the escape of their Horse, who after the
battell was won, rushing fiercely into the thickest of
them, received a shot through his body by the
conquered and flying enemy, and fell down dead.
Whom also <hi>Aboine</hi> did not hotly pursue, being much
troubled with the losse of his brother.</p>
               <p>In this battell, <hi>Montrose</hi> did not lose so much as
one common souldier, and of Gentlemen, one <hi>Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chol,</hi>
and one <hi>Milton;</hi> whose names and families I
should most willingly have inserted, had I been so
happy as to have knowledge of them, because they
died gallantly in the bed of Honour; fighting for
their King, their Liberty, and the Laws. Nor are so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
Pedees as well Scotch as Irish to be forgotten,
boyes scarce fourteen years of age a piece, who
throwing down their masters luggage, &amp; mounting
upon their nags &amp; sumpter-horse, did not onely ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
a faire appearance of a body of Horse, but (as if
they had bin Corrivalls in valour with their masters)
beyond what might be expected from their years &amp;
strength, fell in among the thickest of their enemies.
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:33308:62"/>
Of whom some, but very few were slain, nor did
they sell their lives for nothing; and by that they
gave an ample testimony of their towardnesse,
and of so manly a spirit in children as might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
to riper years. But the losse of the Lord
<hi>Gordon</hi> had so deep an impression upon all mens af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
that they had the face rather of a defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
then victorious army. The first scene of their
sorrovv vvas acted in a dull silence; in the next, the
floud-gates vvere broke open, and the army vvas
full of sighes, and sobs, and vvailing, and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:
and then vvith bedevved cheeks, assoon
as their grief could get a tongue, they blam'd Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and Earth, and Fortune, and every thing for
depriving the King, the Kingdome, the Age, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and their posterity of such a man. Thus for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting
their victory and the spoile, they fixt their
eyes upon the lifelesse body, kissed his face and
hands, commended the singular beauty of the corps,
compared the Nobility of his descent, and the
plentifulnesse of his fortune, vvith the hopefulnesse
of his parts; and counted that an unfortunate victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
that had stood them in so much. And truly it
vvas like to have happened, that their excessive
sorrow for the losse of this noble Gentleman had
conquer'd the Conquerors, had they not comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
themselves vvith the presence and safety of
<hi>Montrose.</hi> Nor could he himself refrain himself from
bewailing vvith salt tears the sad and bitter fate of
his most dear and only friend, but lamented much
that the honour of his Nation, the ornament of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:33308:62"/>
the Scottish Nobility, the ablest assertor of the
Royall Authority in the North, and so intimate a
friend unto himself should be thus cut off in the
flowre of his age. In the mean time, hoping that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and time between them would asswage that
grief, hee commands Physicians to embalme his
noble corps, which afterwards being removed to
<hi>Aberdene,</hi> he saw brought forth with a sumptuous
and Souldier-like Funerall, and interr'd in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument
of his Ancestors in the Cathedrall Church.
This battell was fought at <hi>Alford</hi> on the 2. of

               <p>
                  <hi>MOntrose</hi> that same afternoon that hee had got
this victory at <hi>Alford,</hi> marching to <hi>Clunie</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
allowed onely two or three houres to his soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
for their refreshment. And going from thence
to the banke of the river <hi>Dee,</hi> sent away the Earl
of <hi>Aboine,</hi> who succeeded his deceased brother.
into <hi>Buchanshire,</hi> and the places adjacent for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits;
for many of them who were at the fight
being Highlanders, &amp; not farre from their own ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations,
had dropt home with their pillage. And
because <hi>Macdonell</hi> was not yet returned, hee kept
his quarters at <hi>Cragston,</hi> expecting both him and
<hi>Aboine.</hi> But when hee perceived those Auxiliaries
were dispatched unto him with lesse speed then he
hoped, and finding his expectation deluded, impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
of so long and disadvantageous delay, after he
had got over the <hi>Dee</hi> and <hi>Gransbaine,</hi> fell down into
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:33308:63"/>
                  <hi>Merne,</hi> and lay at <hi>Ferdon</hi> Chapell, once famous for
the See and Sepulchre of St. <hi>Palladius.</hi> Thence hee
sends to the Earl of <hi>Aboine</hi> (who was now come to
<hi>Aberdene</hi>) to hasten unto him into <hi>Merne</hi> with such
Forces as he heard he had raised. <hi>Aboine</hi> came indeed
but brought no great store of Forces along with
him; therefore hee sends him backe into the North
to raise as many men as he could possibly, and bring
them with all speed unto the Camp. Hee himself
going through <hi>Angus</hi> met his Cosen <hi>Patricke Graham</hi>
with his <hi>Athole</hi> men ready to live and die under his
command, and <hi>Mac-donell</hi> with a great power of
Highlanders: with him was <hi>Macklen,</hi> the chief of
his sept, a valiant man, and singularly loyall, who
brought some seven hundred choise Foot of his
friends and clients. Also the Chief of the <hi>Mac-ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds,</hi>
a great man in the Highlands, &amp; one that entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
lov'd the King, who had above five hundred men
at his heels. The <hi>Mac-gregories</hi> also, and the <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabies</hi>
men inferiour to none in valour and hardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:
after the fashion of the Country, followed
their Commanders and Chiefs of their Families,
whose certain number I cannot easily assigne. And
<hi>Glengar,</hi> a man never sufficiently to be commended
for his valour, and loyalty to the King, and service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ablenesse
&amp; affection to <hi>Montrose,</hi> (seeing he in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
almost from the Expedition into <hi>Argyle</hi> had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
departed from him) by his uncles and others
whom he imployed, brought in about five hundred
more. Besides out of the plaines of <hi>Marre</hi> came a
great number of the <hi>Fercbarsons,</hi> gallant men and of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:33308:63"/>
approved valour. And some too out of <hi>Badenoth,</hi> not
many indeed but stout and able men of their hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montrose</hi> being reinforced with such an Army,
resolves to make his way into the heart of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
as wel to spoile the enemies levying of men
in <hi>Fifeshire,</hi> and the Country on this side the <hi>Forth,</hi> as
also to break up the Parliament which the Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
had not without solemnity and ostentation
summoned at Saint <hi>Iohns-tovvne.</hi> Nor did any thing
hinder him but want of Horse, of which alwayes he
had such scarcity, that it was never or very seldome
safe for him to fall down into the plain Country.
But because hee daily expected <hi>Aboine</hi> and <hi>Airley</hi> to
come unto him with a considerable party of Horse,
he passed over the <hi>Tay</hi> at <hi>Dunkeldon,</hi> and lying near
<hi>Amunde,</hi> struck no small terrour into the enemy who
held Saint <hi>Iohns tovvn;</hi> and from thence approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
nearer unto them, he encamped in <hi>Methfyn</hi>
Forrest.</p>
               <p>The enemies Foot (all but the garrison souldiers
in the Towne) lay on the South of the river <hi>Erne.</hi>
The Horse which were designed for the guard of
the Town and Parliament assoon as they discovered
<hi>Montrose</hi>'s Scouts, bring in a hot alarm that hee was
there, and come already close to the gates, and no
question but he meant presently to scale the walls,
and make an assault upon the Town: therefore they
were earnest with the Nobility and the whole Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
to secure themselves by a speedy flight:
when all this while <hi>Montrose</hi> had scarce a hundred
Horse, &amp; they wer four hundred. But he the next day
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:33308:64"/>
the more to encrease their terrour, drew nearer unto
the Town with those Horse hee had, and about the
same number of ready Fire-lockes whom he moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
upon pack-horses; and set out his men in their
view so much to his advantage, that they appeared
a considerable body of Horse. And because the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
kept themselves within the gates, forthwith
turning towards <hi>Duplin,</hi> hee diligently view'd this
side of the River <hi>Erne</hi> and all that coast, as if he had
Horse enough to keep all that Country in subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
And truly thus much he got by it, that the
enemy tooke him to be exceeding strong as well in
Horse as Foot. Therefore they draw together as
many Forces from all sides; as they could make,
whom they intended to fight with <hi>Montrose</hi> if hee
should offer to passe over the <hi>Forth.</hi> But hee finding
it not safe for himself neither to descend into the
champian Country, they both kept their stations
for many dayes, the enemy expecting Auxiliaries
out of <hi>Fife,</hi> and the Country on this side the <hi>Forth,</hi>
and out of the West; and <hi>Montrose</hi> looking for the
like out of the North. And waiting impatiently
for <hi>Aboine</hi> who was too slow with his men, he sent
some to hasten him, least they should lose the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of doing their businesse. Hee also com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained,
but in a soft and gentle manner, as before
a faithfull friend, that <hi>Aboine's</hi> lingring and delay
was in the fault, that a brave victory, by which he
conceived the Rebells might have been utterly
subdued, had slipt out of his hands; which mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
no man doubted but his speed and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:33308:64"/>
might have prevented.</p>
               <p>The enemy when they understood that he onely
cheated them with a false Muster of Horse, having
gotten aid from all parts, and by this time over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numbring
him even in Foot, labour'd not only to
provoke, but even compell him to fight. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
hee concluded to step aside a little into the
neighbouring Mountains, whither he knew either
the enemy would not advance, or if they dit it
would be to their losse. Therefore the enemy draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
near with all their Army to <hi>Methfyn,</hi> he gives
a private command for the Carriages to drive fast
up the hills, whiles he, as if he intended to fight,
orders the battell, makes good the passes with
strong guards, and drawes up the Horse into the
Front. Nor did the enemy expect any other then
to try it out by battell, which hee made as if hee
would give, till such time as the Carriages were got
so farre before, that he conceiv'd them out of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger:
and then he commands the Army in one body
at their close order to march away apace: He gave
charge unto such Horse as he had, and his ablest Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks
to bring up the Reare, &amp; to secure them from
the enemies Horse. The enemy providing for a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
charge, as they expected, when they saw <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trose</hi>
retreating, first pursued eagerly though to no
purpose; for he making good all passes as he went,
easily repulsed them, and without losse of so much
as one private souldier came chearfully off into the
heights and steep places that were unaccessible un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the enemies Horse, and for their Foot they fear'd
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:33308:65"/>
no assault from them. It is remarkable, that
when <hi>Montrose's</hi> Horse were come up unto the
passes, and the enemy knew very well they were not
able to pursue any further; lest with all that paines
they should seem to have done nothing at all, they
sent out three hundred of their ablest and readiest
Horse to follow after them with a great shout &amp; base
language; whom, when <hi>Montrose</hi> saw, he call'd for
only twenty active bodied men of the Highlanders
that were used to hunting, &amp; very good marks-men,
and commanded them to check their insolence; and
they first of all creeping hither, and thither, and hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
their guns, took their aimes so well that they
knockt downe some of the forwardest of those men;
who being men of the better sort, by their example
made the rest more wary, so that they were all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to retreat. But those good huntsmen being
encouraged with their good successe, assoon as they
saw their enemies disorder<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>d, came into the open
plain and resolutely charged their Horse: who, in as
much feare as Bucks or Does chased by Hunters, set
spurs to their Horses and fled back to their maine
body as if the Divell were in them.</p>
               <p>The enemy upon their retreat chose that place
for their Rendezvouz, from whence <hi>Montrose</hi> depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<hi>Methfyn</hi> Forrest: after they had done nothing
worthy to be remembred in all that expedition but
that when thy found themselves unable to cope
with men, they exercised their cruelty upon women:
for all the wives of the Irish and Highlanders that
they light of, (who followed the Camp for the love
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:33308:65"/>
of their husbands) most basely and shamelesly they
hew'd in pieces. <hi>Montrose</hi> kept his quarters at little
<hi>Dunkeldon,</hi> both because the place was cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
and unpassable for Horse, and lay very conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently
for receiving such aids as he daily expected
with <hi>Aboine</hi> out of the North. All which time the
two spleenative Armies lying close together rather
stood upon their guards then offered any affront
one to the other.</p>
               <p>And now at length <hi>Aboine</hi> and Colonell <hi>Nathaniell
Gordon</hi> brought up their men out of the <hi>North</hi> to
<hi>Dunkeldon;</hi> men for their number indeed fewer
then was expect, but for their stoutnesse and true
valour farre above their number. The Horse they
brought were only two hundred, and some six score
Firelocks whom they had mounted and made Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons:
other Foot they brought none. Along with
them came the Earl of <hi>Airley</hi> and Sir <hi>David</hi> his son
with fourscore Horse, most of them of the noble
family of the <hi>Oglebyes;</hi> amongst whom <hi>Alexander</hi>
sonne and heir of Sir <hi>Iohn Ogleby</hi> of <hi>Innercarit</hi> was
most eminent, not onely for the rare accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of his person and the splendor of his Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors,
but for the honour of his valiant and happy
atchievements, much above what his age could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.
<hi>Montrose</hi> being thus well recruited, thought it
not good to lose any time but marched straight to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the enemy. But assoon as he came to <hi>Amonde<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
                  </hi>
he thought it best to see in what condition the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
was, &amp; to find out whether that was true which
he had receiv'd a flying report of; that was, that
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:33308:66"/>
very many of their Auxiliaries had deserted their
colours and run home. Therefore leaving his Foot
to take their rest, a little before night he fac'd the
enemy with his Horse; with which sight being som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
affrighted, they kept within their trenches.
And next morning early <hi>Montrose</hi> riding about to
discover, was informed that they had stollen away
at the dead of the night to <hi>Methfyn,</hi> and in disorder
had got over a bridge upon the <hi>Erne.</hi> Hee instantly
causes his men to march, and passing the river at a
stone-bridge about six miles off, lay that night in
<hi>Strath-Erne.</hi>

But so new fangled in their Religion, and
so bewitched both by the example and authority of
the Nobility, and by the Sermons of their seditious
Ministers, that all of them upon the matter were
extremely addicted to the Covenanters. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
it self is almost an Iland, being inviron'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the South with the <hi>Scottish Firth,</hi> on the
North with the <hi>Tay,</hi> which carrieth ships of great
burden all along; on the East with the maine sea. No
entrance thither by land but on the West, in the

Country was in a distraction, some (especially their
much admired Preachers that thundred nothing

but Excommunications) inciting and compelling
all of every estate and age to take up armes; others
flocking in great numbers unto them, others running
hither and thither to hide themselves, as every one
was led by his own superstition, confidence, or fear.
<hi>Montrose</hi> was very desirous to assault the enemy,
and try the fortune of a battell with them before
they encreas'd their Forces with addition of the
<hi>Fife</hi>-men; but it would not be. For they had so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ified
themselves by the advantage of the ground,
and the narownesse of the passages, that hee could
by no means either make his way unto them or
draw them out into plainer ground. Having there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
made them severall fruitlesse offers of battell,
he resolved to march into the heart of the Country,
and came to <hi>Kinrosse,</hi> as well to hinder the rising of
that Country, as to traine the enemy at last out of
their fastnesse to come in unto the aid of their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed
friends. They, not so much as daring to fall
upon his Rear, turn'd another way, and keeping clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
to the banke first of the <hi>Erne,</hi> afterwards of the <hi>Tay,</hi>
made speed towards the East-side of the Conntry.
As <hi>Montrose</hi> passed along, he sent Colonell <hi>Nathaniell
Gordon,</hi> and Sir <hi>William Rollock</hi> before him with a
small party. These sending the rest of their party
up and down to scout, kept only ten men in their
company: on a sudden they happened upon two
hundred of the enemy who were raising me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> in those
parts; and being not able to retreat, they twelve en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred
the two hundred, put them to flight, kill'd
some and took other some prisoners.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:33308:67"/>
                  <hi>Montrose</hi> that night came to <hi>Kinrosse,</hi> not doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
but they of <hi>Fife</hi> who were exceedingly out of
love with the King, most firm to the Covenanters,
and wholly given to the new superstition, were ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
up in armes. Therefore thinking it not safe
rashly to engage with so great a multitude of Horse
and Foot, hee determin'd to passe over the <hi>Forth<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
                  </hi>
and that upon this ground, that he having wearied
out the <hi>Fife-men</hi> (whom he beleev'd would not bee
easily perswaded to follow the Army further then
their own borders) with long marches might van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish
them without a blow. For he accounted that
most of them being born or brought up in shops, or
ships, or taverns, &amp; not acquainted with the hardship
of souldiers would presently give out and be weary.
Besides such of the Nobility as were in rebellion
(after they saw with sorrow that the seat of the
Warre was drawn so near them as the <hi>Forth</hi>) were
raising men with more eagernesse then ever before
upon the Borders &amp; in the West; of whom the chief
were the Earls of <hi>Lanerick, Cassils,</hi> and <hi>Eglington.</hi>
Whose levies <hi>Montrose</hi> laboured either to hinder,
or draw themselves to his side before they came
up to <hi>Baily</hi> and the <hi>Fife-men;</hi> therefore hee marched
from <hi>Kinrosse</hi> towards <hi>Sterling,</hi> and lay that night
some three miles from the City. The next day sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the Foot before, he followed softly after with
the Horse, because hee suspected that the enemy
pursued him in the Rear.</p>
               <p>Nor was he deceived in that suspition, for some
Espyals whom he left behinde him brought word
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:33308:67"/>
that <hi>Baily</hi> was hard by with the greatest Army that
ever he had. And immediately the enemies Scouts
came within view, one of whom having been too
forward was brought prisoner to <hi>Montrose</hi> by some of
his Horse. He being examined told them freely and
confidently, that he beleeved <hi>Baily</hi> and his party were
resolved to march all that night to engage him to
fight assoon as was possible before they dismist the
<hi>Fife-men,</hi> who being already tir'd he hardly beleev'd
would be drawne over the <hi>Forth;</hi> accounting their
work at an end assoon as the enemy was gone out of
their own Country. Therefore <hi>Montrose</hi> that he might
get speedily over the <hi>Forth,</hi> bid his men march apace,
and going on the other side of <hi>Sterling</hi> (a good
Town, and one of the Kings strongest Castles,
in which the enemy had now a great garrison) that
same night passed over the river at a Ford about four
miles above the Town. And at break of day next
morning made a halt a while about six miles from

the night before had not come over the <hi>Forth,</hi> but
quartered three miles from <hi>Sterling</hi> on the other side

journey, encamped himself in that fatall
place, the Field of <hi>Kilsythe.</hi> He bids the souldiers
to refresh themselves, but however to be in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse
either to fight or march, as occasion should
serve. The enemy the mean while by an easier

who were so much the readier to take up armes, by
how much they had lesse felt the miseries of warre.
Which things being well considered, <hi>Montrose</hi>
thought it best to fight with those Forces which <hi>Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
had at present. For although they were more nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
then his own, yet the danger was like to
be greater of his side, if he should be put to engage
with them when <hi>Lanericks</hi> &amp; other parties were com
up. But moreover hee was either obliged to take
this course or do nothing, and return back into the
Highlands with the blemish of that Honour which
by so many victories he had atchiev'd. The enemy
on the other side being arrogant, and confiding in
the multitude of their men, beleev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>d that <hi>Montrose</hi>
had but made a running march the dayes before,
and had passed the <hi>Forth</hi> more out of fear then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe,
so that they counted it nothing to assault him
in that ground and entrenchment which hee had
chosen to his best advantage. And above all, their
proud hopes were most carefull of this, to block up
all wayes of his escape, and to prevent his return in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Mountains. But there are some that say, <hi>Baily</hi>
himself thought it not best to give him battell, but
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:33308:68"/>
was over-sway'd by the authority and votes of the
Earl of <hi>Lindsey</hi> especially, and some other of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
that were present in the Army, which forc't
him much against stomack to draw up his men, and
order the battell as he could. However it was, early
in the morning they led their men straight upon
<hi>Montrose:</hi> which when he saw, he told the standers
by that that was happen'd which he most desired, for
now hee could supply his want of men by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of the ground; and therefore he made haste
to possesse himself of the fastnesses before them.
Moreover hee commands all his men as wel Horse
as Foot to throw off their doublets, and to affront
the enemy all in white, being naked unto the waste
all but their shirts: which when they had chearfully
performed, they stood there provided and ready to
fight, resolved certainly either to conquer or die.</p>
               <p>In the field where they intended to fight there
were some Cottages and Country-gardens, where
<hi>Montrose</hi> had conveniently lodg'g some few men;
and the first design of the enemy was to dislodge
them. But it took not, for making a fierce assault and
being as stoutly receiv'd, assoon as they were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
to cool something of their first heat, those that
mann'd the places beat them off, drave them away,
and slew them without resistance. The Highlanders
being animated with this happy successe, those that
were next those places not expecting the word of
Command, ran rashly up the hill wich lay open to
the whole strength of the enemy. <hi>Montrose</hi> although
hee was something troubled at the unseasonable
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:33308:69"/>
boldnesse of his men, yet thought it not good to
leave them engaged; nor was it easie to say whethe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the enemy conduc'd more to their fafety. <hi>Montrose</hi>
had in all four thousand four hundred Foot, and five
hundred Horse; a thousand of his Foot or more had
now by their own fault so engaged themselves with
the enemy that they could not come off, for the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
encounter'd them with six thousand Foot and
eight hundred Horse. But the enemies Rear came
up but slowly, and while the Van made a stand ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
their advance, <hi>Montrose</hi> had opportunity
to bring timely aid to his engaged men. But at last
they send out three troops of Horse, and after them
two thousand Foot against those rash and almost lost
men of <hi>Montrose's.</hi> Which when <hi>Montrose</hi> saw (after
others had too dishonourably shifted off that servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce)
he thus bespeaks the Earl of <hi>Airley: You see</hi>
(my noble Lord) <hi>how yonder men of ours by their
unadvisednesse have brought themselves into a most despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
hazzard, and vvill presently be trampled to dirt by
the enemies Horse, except vvee relieve them vvith all
speed. Novv all mens eyes and hearts are fixt upon your
Lordship, they thinke you onely vvorthy so great an
honour as to repell the enemy and bring off our fellow
souldiers. Besides it seemes most proper for you, that
the errour vvhich hath been committed by the foolhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse
of youth, may be corrected by your Lordships grave
and discreet valour.</hi> And he undertook the service
(as dangerous as it was) with al his heart, and
being guarded with a troop of Horse, (in which
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:33308:69"/>
rode <hi>Iohn Ogleby</hi> of <hi>Baldeby,</hi> who had formerly been
a Colonell in <hi>Svvethland,</hi> a stout man, and a skilfull
souldier) led them on straight upon the enemy.
And they giving the charge upon the <hi>Ogleby's,</hi> dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it sharply with them for a while, but at last
being no longer able to withstand their courage
sac't about: whom the <hi>Ogleby's</hi> pursued so hotly, that
they made them fall foule upon their owne Foot;
and (charging them furiously thorough and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough)
routed them and trode them under foot.
By this gallant example of <hi>Airley</hi> and the <hi>Ogleby's,
Montrose's</hi> souldiers being enrag'd more and more
could no longer be kept back from raising a great
shout (as if they had already got the day) and falling
on upon the enemy. Nor would the Rebells Horse
long abide their charge, but deserting their Foot,
fell a running as fast as ever they could: Nor did
their Foot after they were so deserted stand it out
long, but throwing down their armes sought to save
their lives by flight. Which proved unserviceable,
for the victorious pursuers had the killing of them
for fourteene miles: So that of all the enemies Foot
that were present at that battell, it is thought there
did not an hundred come off. Nor did their Horse
escape very well, of whom some were killed, some
taken, the rest disperst. Their Ordnance, their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,
their Spoiles came clearly to the Conquerours,
who lost only six of their side; whereof three were
<hi>Oglebyes,</hi> valiant Gentlemen, who fighting like
themselves, sealed the victory with their own bloud.
The rebellious sort of the Nobility (of whom
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:33308:70"/>
many were in the fight) some of them by their ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
running and swiftnesse of their Horses got to

to the <hi>Scottish Fyrth</hi> shipt themselves in some

whom <hi>Argyle</hi> (having now this third time been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
to a boat) escaped into a ship; and thought
himself scarce safe enough so, till weighing anchor
he got into the main. Of prisoners, the chief were
Sir <hi>William Murray</hi> of <hi>Blebe, Iames Arnot</hi> brother to
the Lord <hi>Burghley,</hi> one Col. <hi>Dice,</hi> and Col. <hi>Wallis,</hi>
besides many more, whom <hi>Montrose</hi> after quarter gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
used courteously, and upon the engagement of
their Honours set at liberty. And this is that famous
victory of <hi>Kilsythe,</hi> obtained on the 15. day of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi>
1645. in which it is beleev'd no fewer then

               <p>THere was a great alteration all the Kingdome
over after this battell at <hi>Kilsythe;</hi> those of the
Rebell-Nobility were all of them sore affrighted,
some of them fled to <hi>Barwicke,</hi> some to <hi>Carlisle,</hi>
some to <hi>Newcastle,</hi> others into <hi>Ireland.</hi> And such as
before only privately wisht wel unto the King, now
did no longer fear to shew themselves to expresse
their loyalty, to pray openly for his prosperity,
and to offer their service. But those that before
had sided with the Covenanters began to ask forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venesse,
to plead they were constrain'd to take up
armes by the violence and tyranny of the Rebells, to
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:33308:70"/>
submit their persons and estates to the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
humbly to beseech his protection, and implore
his wonted clemency. And Cities and Countries
that were furthest off began to dispatch their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
to professe in their names their Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance
to their King, their duty and service to his
Vicegerent, and freely to offer him men, arms, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions,
and other necessaries of War. The Nobility
of the Realm and the Chiefs of Septs came in thick
unto the Lord Governour, welcomed him, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
their service unto him, extoll'd his high and
honourable atchievements, &amp; thank't him for them.
All whom he pardoned for what was past, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
them with liberty and indempnity into his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
and encouraged them to be of good chear.
<hi>Nor did he lay any greater burden upon them, then to change
that covetous and cruell slavery which they were manacled
with by the Rebells, for the sweet and gentle government
and protection of a most gracious Prince; and by laying
aside all former grudges ands fewds, hereafter more reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously
to observe their duty and loyalty to the good King; &amp;
thenceforward never more to have to do with the counsells of
seditious men, who by endeavouring to satisfie their own
lusts, had engaged King and Subject one against the other,
&amp; upon the matter ruin'd both. For his part hee never had
any other intention, then to restore their Religion, their
King, their Liberty, his Peers and Countrimen, by
Armes (when no other means was left) out of the tyranny of
Rebells unto their ancient peace, happinesse, and glory. Which
if he should effect, he would give Almighty God, the author
of all good things, everlasting praise; but if hee failed
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:33308:71"/>
however hee should by these his honest endeavours acquit
himself before God, and Gods Vicegerent his Majesty; before
all good men, and his posterity, his honour, and his conscience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At this time the whole Kingdom sounded nothing
but <hi>Montrose's</hi> praise. Men of all sorts every where
extolling the ingenuity of his disposition in which
he out-went all his Equalls; the gallantry of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in war, his patience in travels, his evennesse of
spirit in dangers, his wisdome in counsels, his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes
to such as submitted, his quicknesse in dispat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
his courtesie to such as he took prisoners; in a
word, his truly heroick vertue in all things, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
all men. And this honour most men gave him
in good earnest, &amp; out of a sincere affection, but som
in craft &amp; dissimulation; and as every one had wit or
skill they set forth his <hi>Encomiums</hi> or <hi>Panegyricks</hi> in Verse
or Prose. Yea such is the volubility of humane things,
and the inconstancy of the whirling multitude, that
they were not affraid openly to curse &amp; raile at the
ringleaders and prime men of the Covenanters Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
such as <hi>Argyle, Lindsey, Loudon,</hi> &amp; others (whom
a while agoe they honoured &amp; adored for Saints) as
authors of al the mischiefs that had befalne them.</p>
               <p>All things going on thus happily, the Northern
parts of the Kingdome being secured on his back,
the way being opened unto him into the South, the
power of the Rebells every where quash't their chief
leaders (who in conscience of their guilt despaired
of mercy) driven out of the Kingdome, &amp; no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
party remaining in armes; yet in the West
there were some stirres. For the Earls of <hi>Cassils</hi> and

                  <hi>Eglingtou,</hi> and some other promoters of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters
Cause laboured to engage the Countries in
a new War, and were said to have rais'd in a tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary
way the number of four thousand men. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Montrose</hi> the next day after the battell of <hi>Kilsythe</hi>
drevv his men into <hi>Cluidsdale,</hi> from vvhence the
Earl of <hi>Lanerick,</hi> being struck vvith the newes of
their late overthrovv, disbanding those men that he
had rais'd, vvas fled. <hi>Montrose</hi> chose that quarter as
lying most commodiously for his affaires in the
South &amp; West; and marched to <hi>Glascow,</hi> vvhich is the
principall city of that Countrey. Hee receiv'd the
Tovvn into his protection, and entring into it vvith
the joyfull acclamations of the people, first of all
he restained his souldiers from plunder, and then
being severe against the delinquents, for the terrour
of others, he put some of the chiefest incendiaries
of them to death. After that in favour of the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens,
the next day after he came, hee departed the
Tovvn and quartered at <hi>Bothwell.</hi> Where because it
was but six miles from the City, lest the Citizens
should bee prejudiced by the insolence of the soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
he gave them leave to stand upon their guard,
and defend the City vvith a garrison of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants.
Hoping vvith such acts of clemency to enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge
not only the men of <hi>Glascow</hi> unto himself, but
the inhabitants of other Cities also, by good offices
more then by force and armes.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Bothwell</hi> he staid many dayes, where he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the personall addresses of some of the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and of others by their Trustees, Friends, and
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:33308:72"/>
Messengers; &amp; settled the peace of Towns &amp; Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
thereabouts, who all willingly submitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
The chief of the inhabitants of those parts
who came to welcome him, and offer their service
were the Marquesse of <hi>Douglasse,</hi> a man of a most no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
family, and chief of the <hi>Douglasses;</hi> the Earls of
<hi>Limmuck, Annandale,</hi> and <hi>Hertfield;</hi> the Lord Barons

Knights: and many more, whose names I
can either not rightly call to mind, or else think fit
to forbear at present, lest by giving them an unseaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
and thanklesse commendation now whiles
they lie under intolerable tyranny, I should do them
more harm then honour.</p>
               <p>After the victory of <hi>Kilsythe,</hi> no thought had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gher
place in <hi>Montrose's</hi> noble breast, then the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement
of such prisoners as for no other fault but
the sin of Loyalty had been most basely used, and still
expected death, in the grievous and filthy gaole of
<hi>Edinburgh.</hi> Therefore hee sends his nephew <hi>Napier</hi>
with Col. <hi>Nathaniell Gordon</hi> and a commanded party
of Horse to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> to summon the City and
receive it upon surrender, to set the prisoners at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
and to settle the Town in peace and loyalty;
but in case they stood out and refused to submit, to
threaten them with fire and sword. They assoon as
they came within four miles of the Town made a
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:33308:72"/>
stand, (and intended to come no nearer, unlesse they
chanced to bee forced unto it by the obstinacy of
the Citizens,) as well that at that distance they
might the more easily restrain the unrulinesse of the
souldier, lest they should wrong the poor inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
&amp; in their fury reduce that cursed City which
had been the cause &amp; fomenter off all the Rebellion
into ashes, which <hi>Montrose</hi> gave them especially in
charge by all means to prevent; as also to preserve
the Army safe from the plague, which was hot in the
City and places adjacent, and where of very many
died every day. Assoon as ever the newes of their
approach was brought unto the Town, they all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to tremble &amp; despaire of their lives; and to raise
a cry as if the swords were already at their throats,
or their houses in a flame. Not a few of them being
pricked in their guilty consciences, freely &amp; openly
accus'd themselves for the most ungratefull, trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous,
sacrilegious, and perjured persons in the
world, and unworthy of any mercy. Then applying
themselves unto the prisoners they had, both calling
unto them aftar off, and sending private messengers,
they implored their assistance; and <hi>besought them in
compassion of the poore silly people vvere almost vvasted too
vvith a great mortality, to pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

mercy but that one time, they vvould redeem their former
revolt vvith more religious fidelity and constant Allegeance
ever after.</hi> The prisoners (whom but the other day
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:33308:73"/>
the basest of the people bitterly abused and reviled,
cursing and bequeathing them to the gallowes and
worse) forgetting all injuries received, &amp; more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
with the sence then revenge of their sufferings;
first rendred hearty thanks to Almighty God who
of his mercy shewed unto them that liberty and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fety
which they little expected<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> &amp; then turning un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their deadly enemies, bade them <hi>be of good cheare,
for the most gracious King (and his Lieutenant</hi> Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trose)
<hi>desired the safety and happinesse of his repenting
Subjects, and not their extirpation and ruine. Therefore
they advised them immediately to send some delegates to</hi>
Montrose, <hi>humbly to beg his pardon; for nothing could
better appease the rage of a Conquerour then a speedy sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission.
For their parts they would not bee backward to
mediate with him for their safety, and doubted not but his
high and noble spirit which could not be vanquished with
their armes, would yet suffer it self to bee overcome with
the prayers and lamentations of men in misery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Edinburgians</hi> being conforted with these ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes,
and assisted with this good advice, immediately
call a Hall to consult of sending delegates. There
were among the prisoners of those that were most
high in birth, and favour with <hi>Montrose, Lodowick,</hi>
Earl of <hi>Crawford,</hi> Chief of the most ancient and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
family of the <hi>Lindseys,</hi> a man famous for Military
service in forraign Nations, amongst the <hi>Swedes,
Imperialists</hi> and <hi>Spaniards.</hi> This man by the power
and cunning of his Cosen the Earl of <hi>Lindsey</hi> (who
because hee was greedy of the honour and title of
the <hi>Earl of Crawford,</hi> was greedy also of his life)
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:33308:73"/>
was designed by the Covenanters to be put to death.
Nor was it for any other crime but for being a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier,
and an expert man, &amp; one that had done faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
service for his Master the King, and it was feared
hee would doe so againe if hee should be suffered
to live. There was also <hi>Iames</hi> Lord <hi>Ogleby,</hi> son to
the Earl of <hi>Airley,</hi> one singularly beloved by <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trose,</hi>
who was formidable both for his fathers and
his own vertue and authority. Hee also being an

<hi>Cravvford.</hi> These therefore the Common Counsell of
<hi>Edinburgh</hi> chose out of the rest of the prisoners, and
immediately setting them at liberty, they earnestly
pray and beseech them to assist their Delegates to
the uttermost of the power they had with the Lord
Governour, and to labour to hold his hands off that
miserable City, upon which the hand of God himself
lay so heavy already. And they curse themselves &amp;
theyr posterity to the pit of hell, if they should ever
prove unmindful of so great a favour or unthankfull
to them that did it. They were not backward to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
a busines which was so universally dÃ©sired,
but taking the Delegates along with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> went forth
to <hi>Napier.</hi> He having by the way delivered his dear

and his sisters out of the prison at <hi>Limnuch,</hi> whither
the Covenanters had removed them from <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi>

                  <hi>Montrose</hi> embracing <hi>Crawford</hi> and <hi>Ogleby,</hi> his dearest

to see them safe and sound, useth them with all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

               <p>
                  <hi>Afterwards the Delegates of</hi> Edinburgh <hi>were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted

They would freely surrender the Town unto the Governor,
humbly desired his pardon, promised to be more dutifull and
loyall for the time to come; committed themselves and all
that they had to his patronage and protection, for which
they earnestly besought him. Moreover they undertooke
forthwith to set the rest of the prisoners at liberty accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his appointment, and to doe any thing else that he
should enjoyne them. And although the City was so wasted
with a grievous contagion that no men could be raised out
of it, yet they were ready as far as their share came, to
pay contribution to such as should be raised in other places.
And above all things they humbly begged at his hands,
that hee would labour to mitigate the anger of their most
gracious Lord the King, that hee might not be too severe
with that City, which by the cunning, authority, and
example of a seditious and prevailing party had been
engaged in Rebellion. <hi>Montrose bade them</hi> be confidens
of the rest, and required no more at their hands then
to bee hereafter more observant of their loyalty to the
King, and faithfully to renounce all correspondence with
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:33308:74"/>
the Rebells in armes against him, either vvithout or
vvithin the Kingdome; To restore the Castle of <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi>
(vvhich it vvas evident vvas in their Custody at
that time) unto the King, and his officers. Lastly, assoon as
the Delegates came home, to set the prisoners at liberty and
send them to him. <hi>And truly as for the prisoners they
sent them away upon their return: but as to other
Articles they were perfidious, and perjured; and if
they doe not repent must one day give an account
unto God the assertor of truth and justice for their
high ingratitude, and reiterated disloyalty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whiles these things passed concerning <hi>Edinburgh,
Montrose</hi> sent away <hi>Alexander Mac-donell</hi> (to
whom hee joyned <hi>Iohn Drummond</hi> of <hi>Bail,</hi> a stout
Gentleman) into the Western coasts to allay the
tumults there, and to spoile the designes of <hi>Cassils</hi>
and <hi>Eglington.</hi> But they receiving the alarme of <hi>Mac-donells</hi>
approach were immediately disperst in a great
fright. Some of the Earls and other Nobles made
straight into <hi>Ireland,</hi> others plaid least in sight in I
know not what lurking places. All the Western
Countries, the Town of <hi>Aire, Irvvin</hi> and others
strove which should first submit, freely offering their
fidelity and service. Neither (which was more then
hee expected) did <hi>Montrose</hi> ever finde men better
affected to the King then in those Western parts:
For most of the Gentry, Knights, and Chiefs of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
and some also of the prime Nobility came off
chearfully to his side. Whose names, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
ought to have been registred with honour, at
the present I shal passe by (if not in an acceptable
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:33308:75"/>
perhaps, yet certainly in an advantageous silence,)
for I should be loath so honest and loyall soules
should be questioned by their cruell enemies, for
their good affections, upon my information.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>MOntrose</hi> had now taken into his thoughts the
setling of the South-borders, and send unto
the Earls of <hi>Hume, Rosburough,</hi> and <hi>Trequaire,</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite
them to associate with him for matter of Peace
and War, and all things that were to be done in the
name and by the authority of the King. These were
not only the powerfullest men in those parts by
reason of the multitude of their friends and their
great retinue, but also made as though they were
most cordiall assertors of the Kings authority. For
besides the bond of Allegeance, which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to them with others, they were engaged unto
him by extraordinary benefits. Nor were they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
advanced unto great Honours by him, as being
raised from the order of Knighthood to a high pitch
of Nobility; but were made Governours of the most
gainfull Countries, and by that means being enri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
above their equalls and their own condition,
heaped up wealth indeed unto themselves, but
envy and hatred upon the King. They againe dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
some of their friends of the best quality to
assure him, <hi>That they were ready to undergoe any hazard
under his conduct and command in the behalf of their
most bountifull King, They promise moreover to raise a world
of men, and nothing hindred their coming up unto the Camp,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:33308:75"/>
if he would but be pleased to draw that way with never so
small a party of his forces. And so it would come to passe,
that not onely their friends and clients, but the whole
Country being animated with his presence and authority,
would cheerfully take up armes as one man; and if they
stood out they might be compelled, or a course taken with
them. Therefore they earnestly besought him to afford them
his assistance in this, and in all the rest he should finde them
his most faithfull and ready servants.</hi> These were fair
words, and a first hearing seem'd to carry an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
meaning along with them; but were promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with that kind of faith that the Creatures and
Favourites of the too indulgent King are used to
keep. And perhaps upon that score he Earl of <hi>Lane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>
(Duke <hi>Hamiltons</hi> brother) is more to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended,
whom <hi>Montrose</hi> having earnestly sollicited
by friends to come off to the Kings side, although
that way he might very likely expect his pardon for
what was past, and the releasement of his brother,
yet without any dissimulation he gave this peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
answer, <hi>That he would have nothing te doe with
that side, and that he would never pretend that friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
which he intended not to preserve.</hi> And I would
to God all they on whom the good King has too
much relied, had delivered themselves with the
same candor and plain dealing ever since the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of those troubles.</p>
               <p>About the same time <hi>Montrose</hi> sent the Marquess
of <hi>Douglasse,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Ogilby</hi> over into <hi>Anan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi>
and <hi>Niddisdale,</hi> that there with the assistance
of the Earls of <hi>Anandale</hi> and <hi>Hartfield,</hi> they might
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:33308:76"/>
list a many souldiers, Horse especially, as they could.
And gives them orders withall to march with such
as they should so raised towards <hi>Trequaire, Roxborough,</hi>
and <hi>Hume;</hi> that they might engage them without
any further put offs in an association with them.
For <hi>Montrose</hi> understood a little what Court-holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water
meant, and therefore was something suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
of the delayes which they fram'd, the rather ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
had some experience of their cunning and slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perinesse,
especially of <hi>Trequaires.</hi> And truly <hi>Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glasse</hi>
by the chearfull endeavours of the Earls of
<hi>Anandale</hi> and <hi>Hartfield,</hi> had quickly raised a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
party, if one count them by the head; but they
were new men, taken from their plowes and flocks,
and but raw soldiers: forward enough at the first
charge, but by and by their hearts faile them, and they
can by no means be kept to their colours. When
<hi>Douglasse</hi> and the rest of the Commanders considered
this, they write againe and againe to <hi>Montrose,</hi> that
he would make haste after them with his old souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
towards <hi>Tweed<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
                  </hi> for by his presence and authority,
and the company and example of the old souldiers,
they might be brought either willingly, or whether
they would or no to know their duties. In the
meane time according to his command they go on
to <hi>Strathgale,</hi> freely offering an opportunity and their
service (if it needed) to <hi>Roxborough</hi> and <hi>Trequaire,</hi>
to draw out their men the more easily and timely.
But they (good men) who well enough under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
the secretest counsels of the Covenanters, and
knew that all their Horse would be there imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:33308:76"/>
out of <hi>England</hi> under the command of David
<hi>Lesley,</hi> intended nothing more then to over-reach
the King with their old tricks, and to deliver <hi>Montro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se</hi>
(whose glory they envied) into the hands of his
enemies, though not by armes (for that they could
not) yet by treachery. To that end they insinuate
againe and againe not only unto <hi>Douglasse</hi> and his
party, but to <hi>Montrose</hi> himself by their friends and
frequent messengers, that for their parts they were
ready to expose their persons to the utmost hazard,
but they could never be able to draw together their
friends, clients, and Trained bands, except they were
animated and couraged with <hi>Montrose</hi> his presence.
And that they might be the better beleeved, they
curse themselves to the pit of hell if they did not
stand stifly and unalterably to their promise. <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trose</hi>
notwithstanding was not taken with all this,
but staid still at <hi>Bothvvell,</hi> conceiving that if there
were any truth or honesty in their words, <hi>Douglasse</hi>
and his party who still lay in the Country adjacent,
would be sufficient for the raising and encouraging
of their friends and dependents.</p>
               <p>At length when <hi>Montrose</hi> had quartered a great
while at <hi>Bothvvell,</hi> most of the Highlanders being
loaden with spoile ran privily away from their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
and returned home. Presently after their very
Commanders desired Furloghs for a little while,
pretending that the enemy had not an Army in the
field within the borders of that Kingdom, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their service for the present might well be spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
besides they complained that their houses and
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:33308:77"/>
corn, in and with which their parents, wives chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
were to be sustained that winter, were fired by
the enemy, and no provision made for them, so that
they humbly desired to be excused for a few weeks,
in which they might take care to secure their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
from hunger and cold. Also they solemnly and
voluntarily engaged their words, that they would
return many more then they went, and much refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
within forty dayes. These <hi>Montrose,</hi> seeing he
could not hold them, as being Voluntiers &amp; fighting
without pay, that he might the more engage them,
thought fit to dismisse them not only with Licences
but Commissions. And giving publick commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
to the souldiers, and thanks in his Majesties
name to the Commanders, exhorting them to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
their businesse closely &amp; vigorously, he appoints
<hi>Alexander Mac-donell</hi> their Countriman and Kinsman
(who was but too ambitious of that employment)
to be their companion and guide, who should bring
them back to the Camp by the day appointed. Who
in a set speech gave thanks in all their names to the
Lord Governour for his so noble favour; and as if he
had been their Baile or surety, with a solemne oath
ondertook for their sudden return: yet hee never
saw <hi>Montrose</hi> after. Nor was he contended to carry
away with him the whole Forces of the Highlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
(who were more then three thousand stout me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>)
but he privily drew away sixscore of the best Irish, as
if (forsooth) he had pick't the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> out for his Live guard.</p>
               <p>About this very time many messengers came se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
wayes to <hi>Bothwell</hi> from the King at <hi>Oxford.</hi>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:33308:77"/>
Amongst whom one was <hi>Andrevv Sandiland,</hi> a
Scotch-man, but bred in <hi>England,</hi> &amp; entred into holy
Orders there, a very upright man, faithfull to the
King, and much respected by <hi>Montrose,</hi> who conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
constantly with him unto the end of the War.
Another was Sir <hi>Robert Spotswood,</hi> once the most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
President of the highest Court in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
and now his Majesties Secretary for that Kingdome;
who passed from <hi>Oxford</hi> through <hi>Wales</hi> into <hi>Angle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sey,</hi>
and thence getting a passage into <hi>Loghaber</hi> came
into <hi>Athole,</hi> and was conducted by the men of
<hi>Athole</hi> unto <hi>Montrose.</hi> Almost all the Agents that
came brought this Instruction amongst the rest,
<hi>That it was his Majesties pleasure, that hee should
joyne unto himself the Earls of</hi> Roxbourogh <hi>and</hi> Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaire,
<hi>and consider in their advice and endeavours; of
whose fidelity and industry no question vvas to be made.</hi>
Moreover, <hi>that he should make haste towards the</hi> Tweed,
<hi>vvhere hee should meet a party of Horse vvhich the
King vvould instantly dispatch out of</hi> England <hi>to bee
commanded by him, with vvhom hee might safely give
battell to</hi> David Lesly, <hi>if (as vvas suspected) he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
that way with the Covenanters Horse.</hi> All this the
respective bearers unanimously delivered, and his
most excellent Majesty being over-credulous signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by his Expresses. And <hi>Montrose</hi> being now over
born with the Kings absolute Commands, takes up
his resolution to march to the side of <hi>Tweed.</hi> But the
day before he went, the souldiers being drawn up
to a Rendezvouz, (before that <hi>Mac-donell</hi> and the
Highlanders were gone) Sir <hi>Robert Spotswood</hi> making
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:33308:78"/>
an humble obeysance, under the Kings Standard,
delivered his Majesties Commission under the Grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>bald
Primrose</hi> Clerk of the Supreme Counsell to be
read aloud. That being ended in a short but stately
Oration, he commended the Valour and Loyalty of
the Souldiers, and the great affection he bore them.
And for <hi>Mac-donell,</hi> he not only extoll'd his gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
in the head of the Army, but by virtue of that
authority that he had received from the King gave
him the honour of Knighthood. For not only <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trose</hi>
but all the Kings friends were confident of the
integrity of the man; whose good opinion he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd,
not only to the undoing of the Kings Cause,
but the utter ruine of himself and his friends.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montrose</hi> following his intended journey, came
the second night to <hi>Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>der</hi> Castle; at which time the
Earl of <hi>Aboine</hi> (whether the Lord Governour would
or no) carried away with him not only his own
men but all the rest of the Northern Forces, whom
he had i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>veighled to desert the service. Nor would
he be perswaded either by reason or the intreaty of
his friends (who heartly detested that shamefull act)
to stay but so much as one week, and then he might
depart not only with the Generals license, but with
honour, and the good esteem of honest men. Seeing
it would be no better; <hi>Montrose</hi> passing by <hi>Edinburgh,</hi>
led his small Army through <hi>Lothainshire,</hi> &amp; in <hi>Strath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale</hi>
joyned with <hi>Douglasse</hi> and the other Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
whose Forces being much diminished, were
daily mouldring more &amp; more. In that coast <hi>Trequair</hi>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:33308:78"/>
himself came unto him, more chearfull and merry
then he used to be; who pretended himself to be a
most faithfull servant not only to his Majesty but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
to <hi>Montrose,</hi> and the next day sent him his son the
Lord <hi>Linton</hi> with a gallant party of Horse, as if they
were to be under his command, that by so likely a
pledge he might make <hi>Montrose</hi> more secure, and so
more easily ruine him. For this was not the first time
that <hi>Trequaire</hi> plaid the Covenanters Scout-master:
that ungratefullest piece of mankind intending to
betray unto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> 
                  <hi>Montrose,</hi> &amp; in him the King himself.</p>
               <p>Now when he was not above twelve miles from
the Lord <hi>Hume</hi> and <hi>Roxborough,</hi> and they sent not so
much as a Messenger to him, nor offered him the
smallest courtesie, <hi>Montrose</hi> being much troubled at
it, resolved to march into their Territories, and to
bring them in either by faire means or foule. But
they prevented him by a singular device; They sent
unto <hi>David Lesley</hi> whom they well knew by that time
was come to <hi>Berwicke</hi> with all the Scotch Horse,
and many English Voluntiers (for they were privy
to all their counsells) and entreated him to send
a party and carry them away in the condition of
prisoners; which he did the day before <hi>Montrose</hi>
came thither. For by this means that crafty old fox
<hi>Roxborough</hi> (who had <hi>Hume</hi> under his girdle) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
that they might both ingratiate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>selves with
the Covenanters, as freely committing themselves
into their protection, &amp; yet keep in the Kings favour
whiles they made as if they fell into <hi>Lesley's</hi> hands,
sore against their wills. And this being <hi>Lesley's</hi> first
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:33308:79"/>
noble exploit, he passed over <hi>Tweed</hi> &amp; marched into
the East-side of <hi>Lothian. Montrose</hi> assoon as he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the King and himself betrai'd by these men,
and saw no hopes of that party of Horse which was
come from the King, and that the too powerfull ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
would block up his passage into the North and
Highlands, resolved to march with those few men
he had into <hi>Niddisdale</hi> and <hi>Annandale,</hi> and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
of <hi>Ayre,</hi> that he might there raise what Horse he
could, for although hee had no certain intelligence
concerning the strength of the enemy, yet hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured
that it consisted especially in Horse.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="16" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. XVI.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>MOntrose</hi> arising from <hi>Kelsow</hi> marched to <hi>Ied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi>
and so to <hi>Selkirk;</hi> where he quartered
his Horse in a Village, and his Foot in a wood close
by. For he was resolved to make sure of all advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
of ground, lest hee should be forced to fight
with an enemy of vvhose strength he knevv nothing
upon uneven termes. Then he commands the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of Horse to set out good store of faithfull and
active Scouts, and to place Horse-guards in conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
places on every side, and look vvell to their
vvatch. All vvhich he in person (as he used to do)
could not see done at present, because that night he
was dispatching letters to the King, &amp; to send away
a trusty messenger that he had light upon, before
break of day: therefore he was earnest with them to
have the more care, lest the enemy who were very
strong in Horse should surprise them unawares. And
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:33308:79"/>
the Commanders promising all care and diligence,
he was so taken up with writing of Letters that hee
slept not all that night. And sending ever and anon
to the Captains of Guards (men that were skilfull
Souldiers, and so known to be in forraign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries)
such uncertain noises as were brought unto
him of the enemies approach, they being deceiv'd
either by the negligence of their Scouts or their
own misfortune, very confidently sent him back
word there was no enemy in those parts nor in the
Country thereabouts. At the break of day some of
the best Horse, and most acquainted with the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
were sent out again to Scout; they also brought
word they had been ten miles about, and diligently
examined all by-wayes, and rashly wisht damnation
to themselves if they could finde an enemy in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
within ten miles. But afterward it appeared
when it was too late, that the enemy with all
their Forces were then scarce four miles from <hi>Selkirk,</hi>
and had lien there all that night in their arms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lesley</hi> that day that <hi>Montrose</hi> departed from <hi>Ied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi>
mustered his men upon <hi>Gladesmore</hi> a plain in
<hi>Lothianshire;</hi> were holding a Counsell of War
with the chief of the Covenanters, the refult was
that he should march to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> &amp; so to the <hi>Forth,</hi>
that hee might hinder <hi>Montrose's</hi> retreat into the
North, and force him to fight whether he would or
no before he joyned with his Highlanders. But
<hi>Lesley</hi> contrary to that resolution, gives order on
a sudden to his whole Forces to wheel to the left
hand, and to march away apace; every one
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:33308:80"/>
wondering that knew not the mistery of the busines<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se;
what should be the meaning of that change of his
resolution, and his intention in that sudden expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
for they marched streight to <hi>Strathgale.</hi> But
the matter was, (as they afterward gathered from the
enemies themselves) hee had received letters by
which he had perfect notice that <hi>Montrose</hi> being at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
only with five hundred Foot, and those Irish,
and a very weak party of new-rais'd Horse, might
very easily be surprised on the borders of <hi>Tweed,</hi> if
<hi>Lesly</hi> would make use of that opportunity was offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him to doe his businesse. Therefore <hi>Lesley</hi> upon
this intelligence made haste thither, and (as I said)
lodg'd within four miles of <hi>Selkirk.</hi> That <hi>Trequaire</hi>
sent those letters unto <hi>Lesley,</hi> although it was the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
report, I cannot certainly affirm; but it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be denied that that same night he sent his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
to his son the Lord <hi>Linton</hi> that he should im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
withdraw himself from the Royall party,
which with much jollity he did. This was like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
being the ungratefullest of all men, deserting
their King of whom none had better deserved, and
staining their posterity. And truly that morning
being very misty gave no small advantage to the
treachery of the enemy; whom at last <hi>Montroses</hi>
frighted Scouts discover'd to march towards him
in a full body at such time as they were not above
half a mile off.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montrose</hi> mounting the first Horse he could light
on, gallops into the field appointed for the Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouz
that morning; where he finds a great deal of
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:33308:80"/>
noise, but no order. The Cavalry being little acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with their duty, &amp; lying already disperst in their
quarters, where they dream't more of baiting their
horses then maintaining their lives and honours,
upon the first alarme which they received from the
enemies Trumpet, ran disorderly up and down they
knew not whither, but never came in the fight. Yet
there were a few, and those were for the most
part Noblemen or Knights, who made all speed
thither and gallantly undertook to make good the
right wing: and they were not above sixscore in all.
Nor did the Foot who (were about five hundred)
make agood appearance, for many of them look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
about their private businesses among the Carria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
by that unseasonable care of saving, lost themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves
and all they had. And, which spoiled the matter
which was bad enough before, most of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
were absent &amp; never came in the field. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
the enemy coming on so speedily left them no
time for deliberation. The enemy therefore who
were six thousand (whereof most were Horse out of
<hi>England</hi>) furiously charging <hi>Montrose's</hi> right wing
were twice gallantly received and repulsed with no
small losse. Nor could they make that noble Troop
give any ground, or break through it, untill at last
laying along those few Foot that withstood them,
they broke in upon the left flank vvhere there vvas
no Horse. By this, tvvo thousand Horse whom the
enemy had sent over to the other side of the river
vvere gotten on the Rear of those noble Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
who, lest being hemb'd in on every side, &amp; gall'd
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:33308:81"/>
with the enemies shot at distance, they should fal
for nothing and unreveng'd, withdrew themselves
every one the best way he could. But the Foot
who could have little security by flight, fighting a
good while stoutly &amp; resolutely, at last upon quarter
ask't and given for their lives, threw down their
armes and yeelded themselves prisoners. Every one
of whom being naked and unarm'd, without any
regard to quarter given, <hi>Lesley</hi> caused to be most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanely
butcher'd. The staine of which perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
cruelty (by which he hath so filthily blurr'd his
hononr, if any he got in forraign service) he shal ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be able to wipe away. As for those that escaped
out of the battell the enemy pursued them no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
being busie in plundering the Carriages, where
they made a lamentable slaughter of Women, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees,
and Cook-boyes: no pity vvas shovvn to sex
nor age, they vvent to the pot altogether. The
number of the slain is not easie to be given, almost
no Horse, and very fevv Foot (besides those that
yeelded themselves and had quarter) fell in that bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell:
vvhich may appear by this, that they vvere no
more then five hundred in all, &amp; before the next day
tvvo hundred and fifty of them came safe to <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trose,</hi>
of all them vvith their svvords by their sides, so
that there could not be as many more missing: and
very fevv vvere taken prisoners, and not untill their
horses being tired, and themselves ignorant of the
vvay, they became a prey to the country people.
Whom they, forgetting all the benefits &amp; protection
they had but nevvly received from <hi>Montrose,</hi> to do
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:33308:81"/>
the Covenanters a favour, delivered up unto their
cruell enemies, to be made by them acceptable sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
to <hi>Baal-Berith,</hi> the god of the Covenant.</p>
               <p>For all that, the Rebell conquerours missed of the
Kings Standards. The one of them (vvhich vvas
carried before the Foot) vvas preserved by an Irish
soldier, a stout man, &amp; of a present spirit vvhen others
vvere almost beside themselves; vvho vvhen he savv
that the enemy had got the day, stript it off the staffe
and vvrapped it about his body: and being other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvise
naked, made his vvay vvith his dravvn svvord
through the thickest of the enemy, and brought it
to <hi>Montrose</hi> at night. Whom he received into his
Life-guard, and gave it him to carry in token of his
valour and loyalty. And the other of them <hi>William
Hie</hi> brother to the Earl of <hi>Kinoule,</hi> a hopefull young
Gentleman (vvho succeeded his uncle by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
side, <hi>Douglasse</hi> son to the Earl of <hi>Morton,</hi>
vvho having receiv'd many and grievous vvounds
at the battell of <hi>Alford,</hi> vvas rendred unable for that
burden) stript from off the staffe too, and carried it
avvay vvith him. And conveighing himself into the
borders of <hi>England,</hi> skulked there a vvhile till the
coast was a little clearer about <hi>Tweed,</hi> and then
through by-wayes and night journies for the most
part, (being accompanied &amp; couducted by his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
friend <hi>Robert Toures,</hi> a stout man and a good
souldier, who had been a Captain in <hi>France</hi> a good
while ago) returned into the North, and presented
that same Royall Standard unto the Generall.</p>
               <p>And now at last <hi>Montrose</hi> when he saw his men
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:33308:82"/>
totally routed and put to flight (which he never savv
before) thought of nothing more for a good space
then to die honourably, and not unrevenged; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
rallying about thirty Horse vvhom he had ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
up in that confusion, he resolved by fair and
honourable death to prevent his falling alive into the
enemies hands. And seeing he vvas not able to break
through the enemies Troops (vvho stood thick
round about him) he gall'd them on the Front, and
Rear, and Flanks, and of such as vvere so hardy as to
adventure out of their ranks, many he slevv, others
he beat back. But vvhen all that he could do vvould
not do his businesse, as God vvould have it this
consideration possessed his resolute and noble spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
That <hi>the losse of that day was but small and easily
regained, because but an inconsiderable part of his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
were there. That the Highlanders were the very nerves
and sinewes of the Kingdome, and all the North was
sound and untouch't. That many of the prime Nobility
and men of power, many Knights too and Chiefs of their
Sep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>s had entered into an association with him; who if he
should miscarry would be suddenly ruined or corrupted,
and by that means the Kings party in</hi> Scotland <hi>utterly
subdued. Therefore he thought himself bound never to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire
of a good Cause, and the rather lest the King his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
should apprehend the losse of Him to be greater then
the losse of the battell.</hi> And vvhile these thoughts
vvere in his head, by good hap came in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quesse
<hi>Douglasse</hi> and Sir <hi>Iohn Dalyell,</hi> vvith some
other frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ds (not many but fatihfull &amp; gallant men)
vvho vvith tears in their eyes (out of the abundance
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:33308:82"/>
of their affection) beseech, intreat, implore him <hi>for
his former atchievements, for his friends sakes, for his Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors,
for his sweet wife &amp; childrens sakes, nay for his Kings,
his Countries, and the Churches peace and safeties sake, that
hee would look to the preservation of his person; conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that all their hopes depended on him alone under God,
and that their lives were so bound up with his, that they
must all live or die together.</hi> At last <hi>Montrose</hi> overcom
with their intreaties, charging through the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
(who vvere by this time more taken up vvith
ransacking the Carriages then follovving the chase)
made his escape: of those that vvere so hardy as to
pursue him, some hee slevv, others (among vvhom
vvas one <hi>Bruce</hi> a Captaine of Horse, and tvvo Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets
vvith their Standards) he carried avvay priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.
Whom he entertained courteously, and after a
fevv dayes dismist them upon their <hi>Parole,</hi> that they
should exchange as many Officers of his of the
like quality, vvhich <hi>Parole</hi> they did not over-pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
perform.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montrose</hi> vvas gotten scarce three miles from <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirk</hi>
vvhen hee having overtaken a great number of
his ovvn men that vvent that vvay, he made a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
considerable party; so that being novv secure from
being fallen upon by the Country people, he march't
avvay by leisure. And as he vvent by the Earl of
<hi>Trequaires</hi> Castle (by vvhose dishonesty he did not
yet knovv that he had been betrai'd) he sent one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him to call forth him and his son that he might
speak vvith them; but his servants bring vvord that
they vvere both from home. Notwithstanding there
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:33308:83"/>
are Gentlemen of credit that testifie, that they were
both within; nor did that gallant Courtier only bid
the Rebells joy of their victory, but was not asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to tell abroad (not without profuse and ill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
laughter) that <hi>Montrose</hi> &amp; the Kings forces
in <hi>Scotland</hi> vvere at last totally routed; his ovvn
daughter the Countesse of <hi>Queensborough,</hi> as far as
modestly she might, blaming him for it. <hi>Montrose</hi>
after he had made a halt a vvhile near a Tovvn called
<hi>Peblis,</hi> untill the souldiers had refresh't themselves &amp;
vvere fit to march, many flocking to them from
every side, at Sun-set they all stoutly entered the
Town; and by break of day next morning (by the
conduct of Sir <hi>Iohn Dalyell</hi> especially) passed over
<hi>Cluid</hi> at a ford. Where the Earls of <hi>Crawford</hi> and
<hi>Airley</hi> having escaped another vvay met vvith him,
making nothing of the losse of the battell assoon as
they savv him out of danger. Nor vvas he lesse joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
at the safety of his friends, then that he had sav'd
&amp; pick't up by the vvay almost two hundred Horse.
But although hee vvas already secure enough from
the pursuit of the enemy, neverthelesse he resolved
to make vvhat haste hee could into <hi>Athole;</hi> that
taking his rise there, he might dravv vvhat forces he
could raise of the Highlanders, &amp; other friends into
the North. Therefore passing first over the <hi>Forth,</hi>
and then the <hi>Ern,</hi> having marched through the
Sherifdome of <hi>Perth</hi> by the foot of the Mountains, he
came thither. As he was on his vvay, he had sent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him <hi>Douglasse</hi> and <hi>Airley</hi> vvith a party of Horse
into <hi>Angus,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Areskin</hi> into <hi>Marre,</hi> that
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:33308:83"/>
they might speedily raise their friends and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
in those parts; and had also sent Sir <hi>Iohn Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyell</hi>
unto the Lord <hi>Carnegy</hi> (with whom he had late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
contracted affinity) with Commissions to that
purpose. Moreover he sent letters to <hi>Mac-donell,</hi> to
require him according to his promise to return with
the Highlanders by the day appointed. But above
all he sollicited <hi>Aboine</hi> both by letters and speciall
messengers, that he would bring back his friends
and clients, who were willing enough of themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves,
and wanted no other encouragement then his
authority and example.</p>

               <p>IT was towards the latter end of Harvest, nor was
the corn reap't in that cold Country, nor their
houses and cottages which the enemy had burnt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired
against the approaching winter (which is for
the most part very sharp thereabouts,) which made
the <hi>Athole</hi>-men to abate some thing of their wonted
forwardnesse. Yet <hi>Montrose</hi> prevailed so far with
them, that they furnished him with four hundred
good Foot, to wait upon him into the North where
there was lesse danger, and faithfully promised
him upon his return, when he was to march South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
hee should command the whole power of
the Country.</p>
               <p>Mean time frequent expresses came from <hi>Aboine</hi>
that hee would wait upon him immediately with
his Forces; and <hi>Mac-donell</hi> promised no lesse for
himself and some other Highlanders. <hi>Areskin</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:33308:84"/>
also unto him that his men vvere in a readinesse,
and vvaited for nothing but either <hi>Aboines</hi> company
(vvho vvas not far off) or <hi>Montrose</hi>'s commands.
About this time there vvere very hot but uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
report of a strong party of Horse that vvere
sent him from the King whom many conceived not
to be far from the South-borders. But other nevves
they had which was too certain, to wit, that there
was a most cruell butchery of what prisoners the
Rebells had, without any distinction of sex or age:
some falling into the hands of the Country people,
were basely murthered by them; others who escap't
them (and found some pity in them that had so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle)
being gathered together, were by order from the
Rebell Lords throwne head-long from off a high
bridge, and the men together with their wives and
sucking children down'd in the river beneath; and
if any chanced to swim towards the side, they were
beaten of with pikes and staves, and thrust down
again into the water. The Noble men and Knights
were kept up in nasty prisons to be exposed to the
scorne of the vulgar, and certainly doom'd at last
to lose their heads. <hi>Montrose</hi> was never so much
troubled as at this sad newes.</p>
               <p>Therefore to the end he might some way relieve
his distressed friends, being impatient of all delay,
with wonderfull speed he climbes over <hi>Gransbaine,</hi>
and passing through the plains of <hi>Marre</hi> and <hi>Strath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done,</hi>
maketh unto the Lord of <hi>Aboine,</hi> that he might
encourage him by his presence to make more hast
into the South. For his design was, assoon as hee
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:33308:84"/>
had joyned his forces with <hi>Areskins</hi> and <hi>Airleys,</hi> and
sent for <hi>Mac-donell</hi> and other Highlanders, &amp; taken
up the <hi>Athole,</hi> men by the way, to march in a great
body straight over the <hi>Forth,</hi> and so both to meet the
Kings Horse, and to fright the enemy, upon their
apprehension of an imminent danger to themselves,
from putting the prisoners to death. For he concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
they durst not be so bold as to execute their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
upon men of Nobility and Eminency, as long as
they had an enemy in the Field, and the victory was
uncertaine. And truly, they being doubtfull and
solicitous what might be the successe of so great
warlike preparations they knew were in providing,
did deferre the execution of the prisoners. <hi>Montrose</hi>
upon his journey found the Lord <hi>Areskin</hi> very sick,
but his clients (whose fidelity and valour hee had
had sundry experiences of, even in the absence of
their Lord) all in a readinesse if <hi>Aboine</hi> did but doe
his part; for they depended much upon his example
and authority. And now the Marquesse of <hi>Huntley,</hi>
after he had plaid least in sight for a year and some
moneths, (it is hard to say, whether awaken'd with
the newes of so many victories obtain'd by <hi>Montrose,</hi>
and the reducing of the Kingdome, or by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull
influence of some bad starre) was returned
home. An unfortunate man &amp; unadvised, who how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
hee would seem most affectionate unto the
Kings Cause (&amp; perhaps was so,) yet he endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by a close and dishonourable envy, rather to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate
<hi>Montroses</hi> glory then to out-vie it. Which
seeing it was not for his credit openly to professe
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:33308:85"/>
even before his own men (who were sufficient wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
of <hi>Montrose</hi>'s admirable virtues) lest by that he
should discover some symptomes of a heart aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from the King; yet he gave out, that for the time
to come he would take upon himself the conduct of
that War against the Rebells; therefore he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
his Tenants, and advised his friends and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
scarce without threats, to fight under no
command but his own. And when they replyed,
<hi>What shall wee then answer to the Commands of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quesse
of</hi> Montrose <hi>whom the King hath declared Generall
Governour of the Kingdome, and Generall of the Army?</hi> He
made ansvver, <hi>That he himself would not be wanting to
the Kings service; but however it concerned much both
his and their honour, that the King and all men should
knovv vvhat assistance they had given him, which could
not otherwise be done then by serving in a body by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> selves.</hi>
Moreover he fell to magnifie his own povver, and
to undervalue <hi>Montrose</hi>'s, to extoll unto the skies
the noble Acts of his Ancestors, (men indeed vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of all honour,) to tell them, <hi>That the</hi> Gordons
<hi>power had been formidable to their neighbours for many
Ages by gone, and was so yet; That it was most unjust that
the atchievements gotten with their bloud and prowesse,
should be accounted upon another mans</hi> (meaning Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trose's)
<hi>score: but for the future he would take a course,
that neither the King should be defrauded of the service
of the</hi> Gordons, <hi>nor the</hi> Gordons <hi>of their deserved
honour, favour, and reward.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All these things the simpler sort tooke to bee
spoken upon all the grounds of equity &amp; honour in
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:33308:85"/>
the world; but as many as were understanding men,
and knew better the disposition of the person, saw
through those expressions a minde too rancorous &amp;
altogether indispos'd towards <hi>Montrose,</hi> and that
his aime was to fetch off as many as he could from
him, not only to the utter ruine of the King and
Kingdome, but even to his own destruction: which
(God knowes) the sad event made too manifest.
Nor were there wanting amongst them desperate
men and of good fore-sight, who condemned this
counsell of his as unwise, unseasonable, and pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
even to himself. For they considered with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
that <hi>he never had any designe that did not miscarry
either by bad play or bad luck. That businesses were better
carried by</hi> Montrose, <hi>and it was ill to make a faction<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>
upon the poore pretence of his carrying away the honour of
it. For if</hi> Huntley <hi>joyned his Forces, and communicated
his counsels unto</hi> Montrose, <hi>he should not be onely able to
defend himself, but subdue his enemies, and gaine unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
the everlasting honour of being one of the Kings Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions;
but if he should make a breach in that manner, it would
prove not onely dishonourable but destructive to him. That</hi>
Montrose (<hi>it could not be denyed) had got many and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
victories with the assistance of the</hi> Huntleys, <hi>but they
had done nothing of note without him.</hi> Therefore they
earnestly desired him, <hi>constantly to adhere unto the Kings
Lieutenant, which as it would be both acceptable and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous
to the King, so it would be well taken with good men,
and honourable to himself.</hi> Nor did some of them fear
to professe openly, that they would yeeld their
duty and service to <hi>Montrose,</hi> if <hi>Huntley</hi> should
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:33308:86"/>
stand out in his humour; and they were as good as
their words. But he refusing the advice of his friends
resolved what ever came on't to run counter too
<hi>Montrose;</hi> nor did <hi>Montrose</hi> ever propose any thing
though never so just, or honourable, or advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
which he would not crosse or reject. And if at
any time <hi>Montrose</hi> condescended to his opinion<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
(which he did often &amp; of purpose) he would present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
change his minde; seeming to comply with him
sometimes before his face, but alwayes averse unto
him behinde his backe, and indeed scarce wel agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with his own self.</p>
               <p>For all this, <hi>Aboine</hi> being at that time solicited by
many expresses from <hi>Montrose,</hi> and the importunity
of his own friends (that he might be some way as
good as his word) met him with a considerable
party at <hi>Druminore,</hi> a Castle of the Lord <hi>Forbeses.</hi> He
brought with him fifteen hundred Foot and three
hundred Horse, all chearfull and ready to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe
any hazard under the command of <hi>Montrose.</hi>
And truly assoon as ever they met, <hi>Aboine</hi> freely
protested hee would carry those men that hee had
whithersoever the Lord Governour should lead him;
but there were many more behinde (which for his
scantnesse of time he had not got together (which
his brother <hi>Lewis</hi> would bring after him. <hi>Montrose</hi>
extolling highly his fidelity and pains, turned back
again almost the same way he came; that taking up
the Lord <hi>Areskins,</hi> and the <hi>Marre</hi> Forces by the
way, and climbing over <hi>Gransbaine,</hi> hee might fall
dovvn into <hi>Athole</hi> and <hi>Angus,</hi> not doubting vvithin
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:33308:86"/>
a fortnight to be able to passe over the <hi>Forth</hi> with a
great Army. The first dayes journey <hi>Aboine</hi> and his
men marched with a good will, but the next night his
brother <hi>Lewis</hi> (whom <hi>Montrose</hi> had placed under the
command of the Earl of <hi>Crawford</hi>) conveighed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
homewards with a strong party of Horse, making
as if he meant to encounter some Troops of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and carried along with him as many Souldiers as
he could get upon pretence of a guard. <hi>Crawford</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
brought word that <hi>Lewis</hi> was gone home, but
would be back again next day, for so he had made
him beleeve though he intended nothing lesse then to
come back; (A youth liable to sensure for more feats
then that.) But when upon the third day they came
to <hi>Alford,</hi> it was observed that <hi>Aboines</hi> men were slow
to stand to their colours, that they loytered in their
march, that their ranks were thin and disorder'd and
that they ran away by whole Companies almost every
night: and at last their Commander <hi>Aboine</hi> himself
was not ashamed to disire to be excused, and to have
leave to depart. When all men wondred, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
to know what might be the reason of that sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
alteration of his resolution, he pleaded <hi>his fathers
Commands, which he was obliged in no case to disobey; and
that his father had not sent him such directions without just
occasion: for the Enemies Forces lay in lower</hi> Marre, <hi>and
would be presently upon their backs, if they were deprived of
the protection of their own men: and that it was unexcusable
folly for him to carry his men another way when his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
was in so much danger.</hi> Montrose reply'd, <hi>That it was
most certaine that onely a few Troops of Horse kept within</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berdene,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:33308:87"/>
                  <hi>that they had no Footat at all, &amp; those few Horse now

into the Sherifdome of <hi>Perth,</hi> where receiving an

<hi>Aboine</hi> having sent him word he would be with him

expressed so much loyalty and love to the King, that
he was a large partaker of the rewards which Rebells

on his march or in <hi>Strath-Erne;</hi> and perceived that

                  </gap>bels began to grow more outrageous towards
the prisoners being impatient of further delay crosseth
over the <hi>Forth,</hi> and came into <hi>Leven:</hi> &amp; he encamped
upon the land of Sir <hi>Iohn Buchanan</hi> the Ringleader of
the Covenanters in those parts, expecting that by that
meanes, lying so near <hi>Glascow,</hi> he might fright the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells
(who then kept a Convention of Estates there)
from the murther of the prisoners. To which end fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
the City every day with his Horse, he wasted the
enemies Country without any resistances although at
that time for the guard of the Estates and City they
had three thousand Horse in their quarters, and he
not full three hundred, &amp; twelve hundred Foot. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
before his coming down into <hi>Leven,</hi> the
Covenanters assoon as they understood that <hi>Huntley</hi> &amp;
<hi>Montrose</hi> agreed not, and that <hi>Aboine</hi> and his men had
deserted him in upper <hi>Marre,</hi> as a prologue to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing
Tragedy, had beheaded three stout and gallant
Gentlemen.</p>
               <p>The first was Sir <hi>William Rollock,</hi> one of whom we
have had often occasion to make hononrable men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
a valiant &amp; expert man, dear unto <hi>Montrose</hi> from
a childe, and faithfull unto him to his last breath. The
chief of his crimes was that he would not pollute his
hands with a most abominable murder. For being

the battell of <hi>Aberdene,</hi> he was taken prisoner by the
Enemy, &amp; was condemned unto death, which he had

                        <desc>â€¢</desc>

                  <hi>Montroses</hi> head, and promised great rewards, honours,
and preferments to whomsoever should bring it in)
and had taken upon himself to commit that treason
which he abhorred with all his soule. By which shift
having his life &amp; liberty give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> him, he returned straight
to <hi>Montrose,</hi> and discovered all unto him, beseeching
him to be more carefull of himself, for not he onely
(vvho heartily detested so high a villany) but many
more, had been offered great matters, most of whom
would use their best endeavours to dispatch him.</p>
               <p>The next was <hi>Alexander Ogleby,</hi> of whom we also
spake before, eldest son to Sir <hi>Iohn Ogleby</hi> of <hi>Innercarit,</hi>
descended of an ancient family, and much renowned
in the Scottish Chronicles. He was but yet a youth
(scarce twenty,) but valiant above his age, and of a
present and daring spirit. Nor can I hear or so much
as conjecture what they had to lay to his charge, but
that new and unheard of Treason, to wit, his bounded
duty and loyalty to his King. But there vvas no help
for't but <hi>Arg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>yle</hi> must needs sacrifice that hopeful youth
if it had been for nothing but his names sake, for he
bare an implacable fewd to the <hi>Oglebyes.</hi> The third
vvas Sir <hi>Philip Nesbit,</hi> of an ancient family also, and
Chief of it next his Father; who had done honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
service in the Kings Army in <hi>England,</hi> and had the
command of a Regiment there. Nor can I discover
any reason they had to put him to death neither, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
that which is used when they have nothing else
to say, that mad charge of the new high Treason, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
it was that their guilty consciences suggested un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them that that courageous and viglant man might
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:33308:89"/>
take occasion sometime hereafter to be even with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
for the horrid injuries they had done his Father &amp; his
Family. However these men suffer'd a noble death
with patience and constancy, as became honest men
and good Christians. And unto these there are two
brave Irish Gentlemen that deserve to be joyned, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell
<hi>O-Cahen</hi> &amp; Colonel <hi>Laghlin,</hi> odious unto the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
only for this impardonable crime, that they had
had many experiments of their courage and gallantry.
These Irish Gentlemen were murthered indeed at <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinburgh,</hi>
but many more were doom'd to the like exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
at <hi>Glascow</hi> had not <hi>Mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>troses</hi> unexpected approach
within a few miles of the City had so much influence
that it repriev'd them till another time. The Lord Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
was very much perplexed with the newes of
these mens death, &amp; it was a question whether he was
more vex't at the cruel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>y of the Rebells, or the neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
if not treachety of his friends. For besides <hi>Huntley,</hi>
whose Forces he had so long in vaine expected to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
with his son <hi>Aboine, Mac-donell</hi> also himself (of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
he entertained an exceeding good opinion) being ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
sent unto, &amp; invited also by the nearnesse of the place,
although the time appointed by himself was already
past &amp; gone, made no appearance of his approach. Six
weeks had now passed since <hi>Aboine</hi> had engaged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
for the Northern Forces &amp; the winter (then which
our age never saw sharper) was already deeply entred.
Besides the aids that the King had sent under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>d
of the Lord <hi>Dig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>y</hi> were defeated: al which might
easily have been salv'd, and the Kingdome reduced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
if those great Professors of loyalty had not plaid
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:33308:90"/>
loose in that good Cause. Therefore at last on the
20. of <hi>November, Montrose</hi> departing from <hi>Levin,</hi> and
passing over the Mountains of <hi>Taich,</hi> now covered
with deep snow, through woods and bogges whose
names I do not at this time well remember, crossing
also through <hi>Strath-Erne</hi> &amp; over the <hi>Tay,</hi> returned into
<hi>Athole.</hi> There he met Captain <hi>Ogleby</hi> and Captain
<hi>Nesbit,</hi> whom he had formerly sent with the Kings in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions
unto <hi>Huntley.</hi> And they bring word the man
was obstinate and inflexible, who would beleeve no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that they said; &amp; when they unfolded unto him
the Kings Commands answered scornfully. <hi>That he
understood all the Kings businesse better then they or the Gou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
himself; and neither he nor any of his Children should
have any thing to doe with him.</hi> Moreover he sharply &amp;
threatningly reproved his friends &amp; clients, who had
willingly assisted <hi>Montrose,</hi> and dealt worse with them
then with Rebells. Neverthelesse the Lord Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
thought best to take no notice of any of these
things, but bear with them; &amp; whiles he treats with
the <hi>Athole</hi> men for the setling of the <hi>Militia</hi> of that
Countrey, he sends again unto <hi>Huntley</hi> by Sir <hi>Iohn Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyell,</hi>
as a more fit mediator of friendship. Who was
<hi>To informe him of the danger the King and Kingdome was in,
and so of the present misery that hung over his &amp; all faithfull
Subjects heads; and to make it appear unto him that it was no
ones but his and his sons fault, both that they had not brought in
the supplies into</hi> Scotland <hi>which the King had sent, and that
the prisoners, who were gallant and faithfull men, had been so
cruelly butchered; and that yet there were many more remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
that had near relations to</hi> Huntley <hi>himself &amp; some also
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:33308:90"/>
of the prime Nobility, whom the Rebels would cut of after the same
fashion unlesse they were now at last relieved.</hi> And lastly, <hi>to pray
and beseech him that at least he would grant the Kings Governor the
favour of a friendly conference, promising he would give him abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
satisfaction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Huntley</hi> although he answered <hi>Dalyel</hi> in all things
according to his wonted peevishnesse, yet he was
most of all averse to a Conference; as fearing (seeing
he should have nothing to answer to his arguments
and reasons) the presence, the confidence, and the
wisdome of so excellent a man. But <hi>Montrose,</hi> assoon
as things were setled in <hi>Athole,</hi> that he might leave
nothing unattempted that might possibly bring him
to better thoughts; resolved, dissembling all injuries,
and obliging him by all good offices, to surprise him,
and be friends with him whether he would or no; and
to treat with him concerning all things that concern'd
his Majesties service. Therefore in the moneth of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi>
he forced his way very hardly through rivers
and brooks, that were frozen indeed, but not so hard
as to bear mens waight, over the tops of hills and crag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
rocks, in a deep snow; and passing through <hi>Angus</hi>
and over <hi>Gransbaine,</hi> drew his Forces into the North:
and almost before he was discover'd marched with a
few men into <hi>Strathbogy,</hi> where <hi>Huntley</hi> then liv'd.
But he being struck with his unexpected approach,
upon the first newes he heard of him, lest he should be
forced to a Conference against his will, immediately
fled to <hi>Bogie,</hi> a Castle of his situated upon the mouth
of the <hi>Spey;</hi> as if he intended to ferry over the river and
to wage war against the Rebelles in <hi>Murray.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:33308:91"/>
And now it comes into my minde briefly to enquire what
night be the reason why <hi>Huntley</hi> bore such a spleen against <hi>Mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trose,</hi>
who had never give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> him any distaste, but had obliged him
with courtesies many times undeserved. Nor could I ever hear
nor so much as guesse at any other cause but a weak and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
(emulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> I cannot call it, but) envy of his surpassing worth
&amp; honour. For I should be loath to say that his minde was ever
alienated from the King, but onely averse unto <hi>Montrose;</hi> with
the unjust hatred of whom he was so possest, that he precipitated
himself into many unexcusable mistakes; insomuch as he desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
rather al things were lost then that <hi>Montrose</hi> should have the
honour of saving them. And now being already<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> puffed up with
an unbeseeming conceit of himself, he was the more exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enraged against him upon the remembrance of those injuries
and disgraces he had heretofore throwne upon him; &amp; that was
the chief reason (as I take it) that he so often avoided the sight
of him. For, besides what we have occasionally delivered,
both the father and the sons had put neither few nor small af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts
upon the Kings Vicegerent; some few of which it will
not be out of our way to relate.</p>
               <p>The great guns which we told you <hi>Montrose</hi> had hid in the
ground the last year, they digging them up without his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
carried away in a kinde of triumph, and disposed of them
in their owne Castles as if they had been spoiles taken from the
Enemy, and would not restore them upon demand. But those
<hi>Montrose</hi> had got in the fights at Saint <hi>Iohan towne</hi> and at <hi>Aberde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne;</hi>
in the former of which there was never a man present of
that Family, and in the other <hi>Lewis Gordon</hi> and his men fought
on the enemies side. Besides they so converted unto their own
use the Gunpowder, and Arms, and other necessaries of War,
which were gained from the enemy, and only deposited in their
Castles as in safe and convenient store-houses, that they would
never make any restitution of the least part of them when they
were desired. Moreover <hi>Aboine</hi> upon his returne home after
the victory of <hi>Kilfythe</hi> set at liberty the Earle of <hi>Keith</hi> Lord
Marshall of <hi>Scotland,</hi> a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>d the Lord Viscount <hi>Arbuthnot,</hi> &amp; other
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:33308:91"/>
men of quality of the Enemies side who were within his custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
without acquainting the Governour of the Kingdome, and
his brother-in-law young <hi>Drumme</hi> (who by chance was present)
earnestly declaring his dislike of it. Vpon what termes he did
it, it is uncertain, but this is evident, that (besides the affront
done to the Lord Gouvernour, and the losse of <hi>Dunotter</hi> Castle,
which was of great strength and concernment in that Warre,
&amp; other Military advantages they got by it) the Rebells would
never have had the boldnesse to fall so cruelly upon the Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
if he had but kept them in safe custody.</p>
               <p>Yet more, by his own private authority, he exacted
Tributes, and Customes, and Taxes, (which the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
himself had never done) upon pretence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
of maintaining the War, but in truth to far other
uses, and to the grievous prejudice of the Kings cause.
Last of all (which is most to be lamented) either at the
intreaty of the enemy, or for smal sums of money, they
had enlarged the prisonners that had been taken in the
former Battells in the North, and committed to custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
in their Castles. Nor would they permit them to
<hi>Montroses</hi> disposall, though being prisoners of Warre
he had reserved the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> for that only purpose, by exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
them to save the lives of Gallant and deserving
men. <hi>Huntley</hi> being pricked in his conscience about
all these things, was alwayes as afraid of <hi>Montroses</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
as of a Pest-house.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Montrose</hi> for all that, passing by injuries, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
aside all other matters, bestowed his whole endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
in the promoting of the Kings service. And to
that end he was resolved to intrude himself into his
company though never so unwelcome, to insinuate
into his friendship upon any conditions, to yeeld unto
him in all things, and to deny nothing so that he might
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:33308:92"/>
qualifie <hi>Huntleys</hi> imbitr'd spirit. Therefore leaving

So they having come of with credit returned home.</p>
               <p>At that time the Rebells held their Convention of
Estates at Saint <hi>Andrews,</hi> which they polluted with the
Innocent and I feare crying bloud of men never suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
to be commended. They had amongst their
pri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>oners some very eminent men, as appeared by the
hatred the Rebells bare them, (for they scarce sought
the bloud of any but the best of men, but for others of
whom they were not so much affraid, they satisfied
themselves only with their Sequestration &amp; Plunder,)
amongst who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> were the Lord <hi>Ogleby,</hi> Sir <hi>William Spots<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,
William Murray</hi> a noble young Gentleman, and
<hi>Andrew Gutherey</hi> a stout Gentleman &amp; an active, whom
they determied to put to death in that City, to appease
the Ghosts of the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> of that Province with their bloud
of whom it is reported above five thousand had been
slaine in severall battells. Now, because they intended
not to proceed against them by Law, but according to
their own lusts, they have recourse to their old shifts,
&amp; make Religion draw the curtaine over their cruelty
To which purpose they set up their Prophets <hi>Kant</hi> and
<hi>Blaire,</hi> &amp; others that were possessed with the same spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

nor could the sins of the Nation be otherwise expiated, or the

               <p>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:33308:94"/>
And by this art especially they provoked the hearts
of the people (otherwise inclined to pity) to thinke
upon them as accursed things, and own'd and devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to destruction; perswading them that they ough<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
to have no protection of humane Lawes, nor any Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate
to plead for them whom God himself indited
and accus'd. Nor did those excellent interpreters
and deciders of Gods secret will make any scruple to
sentence the soules, and bodies, and all of so great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents
unto hell and damnation. And having by
this means blinded the people, it was easie for them
who were their accusers &amp; judges both, to condemne
the innocent men who were destitute of al patronage
and protection.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Ogleby,</hi> who was not onely the most eminent of
them for Nobility and powr, but also was a <hi>Hamilton</hi>
by his mothers side, and cousen-german to <hi>Lindsey,</hi>
pretending himself sick, with much adoe got so much
favour as to have his mother, wife, and sisters suffered
to visite him in prison. Which when he had obtain'd,
whilst his keepers in reverence to the honourable La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
vvithdrevv out of his chamber, he immediately
puts on his sisters govvne vvhich she had put off, and
vvas dressed in all her attire. She also put on his cap
in vvhich he used to lie sick in bed, and lay dovvn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of her brother. At last many salutations and
some tears passing on both sides, at eight of the clock
in the night, in the habite and likenesse of his sister he
deceived his keepers vvho lighted him out vvith ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
and torches. And immediately departing the City,
he took a horse (vvhich he had laid for him) vvith tvvo
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:33308:94"/>
of his followers, and before morning was got out of
danger. But when the next day his observant keepers
had found out their mistake, <hi>Arg yle</hi> was so unable to
containe his wrath and revenge, that he would needs
have the noble Ladies (and the more noble for this
their compassion and adventure) brought in question
for it. But he could not effect it, for by reason of the
equity of their cause, they found much stronger frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ds
then he could, of the <hi>Hamiltons</hi> and <hi>Lindsey;</hi> by whose
connivence it is conceived by many that all this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
was acted; but in a thing that is uncertaine I
shall determine nothing.</p>
               <p>This cleanly conveiance of <hi>Ogleby</hi> out of their hands
vext the Rebells exceedingly, and made them almost
wilde; whence it happened that they made a quick
dispatch of the rest. And the first that suffered was
Colonell <hi>Nat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>aniel Gordon,</hi> a man of excellent endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
both of body and minde. Who being near
unto his death, bitterly lamented with many tears that
the carriage of his youth had been much otherwise
then it ought to have been. And when being ready
to die, they offered him an Instrument to signe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he vvas to testifie his repentance, he subscribed it
without any more adoe; and withall call'd God, and
his Angels, and the men there present to witnesse, that
if any thing was contained in that paper which vvas
contrary to the King, his Crown, or authority, he ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
disavovved it. Then being absolved from the
sentence of Excommunication under vvhich he lay
for adultery long since committed, to the great grief
of the beholders he laid down his neck upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> the block.
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:33308:95"/>
A man subject indeed to that fault, but famous for his
valour &amp; souldiership both in forraign Countries and
at home.</p>
               <p>The next that was brought upon the Scaffold yet
reeking with the bloud of Colonell <hi>Gordon,</hi> was a man
worthy of everlasting memory. Sir <hi>Robert Spotswood,</hi>
one rais'd by the favour of King <hi>Iames</hi> &amp; King <hi>Charles</hi>
unto great honours, as his singular vertues did merit.
King <hi>Iames</hi> made him a Knight, &amp; a privy Counsellor:
King <hi>Charles</hi> advanced him to be Lord President of the
Session, and now but of late Principall Secretary of
<hi>Scotland.</hi> This excellent man (although his very Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
had nothing to lay to his charge through all his
life) they found guilty of high Treason; which is yet
the more to be lamented, because he never bore armes
against them; for his eminency lay in the way of peace
not knowing what belong'd to drawing of a Sword.
This was therefore the onely charge that they laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him; That by the Kings command he brought
his letters Pate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ts unto <hi>Montrose,</hi> whereby he was made
Vice-roy of the Kingdome, and General of the army.
Neverthelesse he proved at large that he had done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in that, but according to the custom of their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors,
&amp; the Lawes of the land. And truly he seemed
in his most elegant Defence to have given satisfaction
to all men except his judges, (whom the Rebells had
pick't out from amongst his most malicious enemies
that sought his death,) so that questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>lesse they would
never have pronounc'd that dolefull sentence, if they
had but the least tincture of Iustice or honesty. But to
speak the truth, a more powerfull envy then his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:33308:95"/>
was able to struggle with undid the good man;
For the Earl of <hi>Lanerick</hi> having been heretofore Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Secretary of the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland,</hi> by his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt
unto the Rebells forced the most gracious and
bountifull King to the whole family of the <hi>Hamiltons,</hi>
to take that Office fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> so unthankfull a man &amp; bestow
it on another: nor was there any one found more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> 
                  <hi>Spotswood</hi> to be advanced to so high an honour.
And hence happened that great weight of envy &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
to be thrown upon him, which seeing he was
not able to bear out, he was forced to fall under.</p>
               <p>And now <hi>Spotswood</hi> being about to die, abating no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of his wonted constancy and gravity, according
to the custome of the Country made a Speech unto
the people. But that Sacrilegious thief <hi>Blair,</hi> who
stood by him upon the Scaffold against his wil, fearing
the eloquence and undauntednesse of so gallant a man
lest the mysteries of Rebellion should be discovered)
by one of his gravity and authority) unto the people,
(who use most attentively to hear, and tenaciously
to remember the words of dying men) procured the
Provost of the City (who had been once a servant to
<hi>Spotswoods</hi> Father) to stop his mouth. Which insolent,
and more then ordinary discourtesie, he took no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of; but letting his Speech unto the people alone,
he wholly bestowed himself in devotions and prayers
to Almighty God. Being interrupted againe, &amp; that
very importunately, by that busie and troublesom fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<hi>Blair,</hi> and asked, <hi>Whether he would not have him and
the people to pray for the salvation of his soule?</hi> He made ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
<hi>That he desired the Prayers of the people, but for his impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:33308:96"/>
Prayers which were abominable unto God, he desir'd not to
trouble him.</hi> And added moreover, <hi>That of all the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
with which the offended Majesty of God had scourged that
Nation, this was much the greatest (greater then the Sword, or
Fire, or Pestilence) that for the sins of the people, God had sent
a lying Spirit into the mouth of the Prophets.</hi> With which
free &amp; undeniable saying, <hi>Blaire</hi> finding himself galled
grew so extremely in passion, that he could not hold
from scurrilous &amp; contumelious language against his
father who had bee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> long dead, &amp; against himself who
was now a dying; aproving himself a fine Preacher of
Christian patience &amp; Longanimity the while. But all
these things <hi>Spotswood</hi> having his minde fixed upon hig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her
matters, passed by with silence and unmoved. At
last being undaunted, &amp; shewing no alteration neither
in his voyce nor countenance, when he laid down his
neck to the fatal stroke, these were his last words, <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull
Iesu, gather my soule unto thy Saints and Martyrs who
have run before me in this race.</hi> And certainly seeing
Martyrdome may be undergone not only for the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of our Faith, but for any vertue by which holy
men make their Faith manifest; there is no doubt but
he hath received that Crown.</p>
               <p>And this was the end (a dolefull end indeed in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of us, but a joyfull and honourable one in him,)
of a man admirable for his knowledge of things Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne

to an honest death in the behalfe of so good a King, and so just
a Cause; which those that were present should see he embraced
without fear, and perhaps another generation would not report
without praise. For his sins he humbly begged mercy a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

And that now they might put the last Scene to a
Tragedy of which most part was acted, after two dayes
breathing they brought forth <hi>William Murray,</hi> bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the Earl of <hi>Tullibardin,</hi> a young Gentlemen,
to the same place. And truly every man much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired,
that his brother being in great favour &amp; esteem
amongst the Covenanters, had not interceded for the
life and safety of his own onely brother. Some im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
it to his floth, others to his covetounesse, as
gaping after his brothers estate, others to his stupid &amp;
superstitious zeale to the Cause; but even all, the very
Covenanters themselves, condemned his silence in
such a case as dishonourable, and mis-becoming a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
spirit. But the Youth himself, being not above
nineteen years old, purchased unto himself everlasting
renovvn with posterity for so honest and honourable
an end. Amongst those few-things which he spake
to the people, those that heard him told me these
words, which he spake with a higher voyce then the
rest; <hi>Account</hi> (O my Countrimen) <hi>that a new and high ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of honour is this day atcheived to the house of</hi> Tulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardin
<hi>and the whole Nation of the</hi> Murrays, <hi>that a young
man descended of that ancient stock, willingly and chearfully
delivered up his innocent soule (as unto men) in the very flower
of his youth, for his King, the Father of his Country, and the
most munificent Patron of our Family. Nor let my most
honoured mother, my dear sisters, my kindred, or any of
my friends be sorry for the shortnesse of my life, which is
abundantly recompenced with the honourablenesse of my death.
Pray for my soule, and God be with you.</hi>

               <p>THe death of his friends troubled <hi>Montrose</hi> excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly;
as it had reason; but yet it was not able to
break or shake his firm and setled resolution. Nor did
his noble and more then ordinarily elevated spirit ever
give greater evidences of it self then now. For there
were many who being enraged with the unworthy
murder of their friends egg'd him on being already
sufficiently discontended, to a present revenge. And
whiles they too much favoured their grief (although
it wast just) and seem'd to desire nothing but was fit, to
wit, to render them like for like, they wearied out the
Generall with their many, and troublesome, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable
complaints. For they must needs be angry,
that their companions, their friends, their kindred,
noble and gallant Gentlemen, vvel deserving of their
King, their Country, and the Generall himself, should
be murther'd contrary to their faith promised them,
the custome of vvar, the Law of the Land, of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and of Nature, and all unreveng'd: and on the
other side such Rebells as had been taken by him to be
kept rather as in their friends houses then in prisons, to
rejoyce, to triumph, tolaugh at their sorrow: And
therefore they humbly desired such prisoners might
be tryed as Malefactors; nor would the Enemy be
otherwise frighted from their unheard of cruelty, nor
the minds of his own men otherwise satisfied and
raised up. Whom he entertained with a courteous
Speech, commended them for the love they bare their
frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ds, &amp; told the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, <hi>That the bloud of those honourable and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent

Subjects ought to be reveng'd endeed, but such a way as became ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
and valiant men; not by basenesse and mischief as the Rebells doe,
but by true valour, in a Soldier-like way. It concerned them so to
tame, as not to imitate the wickednesse of their Enemies. Nor, if they
considered matters well, was it conscience, that those that were priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
with them, and so could not be accessary unto the murther of their
frinds, should suffer for those sins of which they were innocent. The
faith that they had passed uuto them was a most sacred things, and to
be kept inviolate even by Enemies. VVhy should they make themselves
guilty of that which they so much abhorred in their Enemies? The time
would come when they must give a severe account of it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p>Now <hi>Huntley,</hi> who intended nothing lesse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> what
he promised <hi>Montrose</hi> before his face, having passed
over the <hi>Spey,</hi> and entred into <hi>Murray,</hi> trifled away
his time, and wasted his strength without either ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
or profit, a good way off <hi>Innernesse.</hi> For giving
his minde too much to prey and spoile, after he had
wasted the Country; he heard a flying report that the
inhabitants had hid their Gold and Silver, and the
best of their stuffe in certaine <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                  </gap> and obscure Cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les.
Which willes he assaults in vaine, and could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by commands, nor intreaties be taken off from
his resolution, the Enemy sending in provision on that
side which he had undertaken to block up, relived
<hi>Innernesse</hi> vvith all things that they wanted. Which
if he had hindered, as he undertook unto <hi>Montrose,</hi>
the garrison vvould have been shortly forced to yeeld.
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:33308:98"/>
And <hi>Montrose</hi> having now received intelligence that
Major Generall <hi>Middelton</hi> was come with six hundred
Horse and eight hundred Foot as far as <hi>Aberdene,</hi> and
was like to lay waste <hi>Huntleys</hi> and the <hi>Gordons</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
sent Colonell <hi>William Stuart</hi> unto <hi>Huntley</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
him to return again unto the siege of <hi>Innernesse</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his engagement: Or if he did not aprove so
well of that, because the Enemy was advanced so near
his Territories, he should perswade him to joyne his
Forces with his, and to march immediately towards
the Enemy, whom he doubted not with an easie ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
to overthrow. To which he answered scornful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that he vvould look to his ovvn businesse himself,
nor did he need the help and assistance of <hi>Montrose</hi> to
drive the Enemy out of his borders. At last after ten
weeks spent in the siege of a small inconsiderable Cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le,
and the losse of all the forvvardest of his men, he
was forced vvith dishonour to raise the siege, when
he vvas never the nearer. And in contempt not so
much of <hi>Montrose,</hi> as of the Kings Majesty, he retrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the <hi>Spey</hi> without the consent or Knowledge of
the Vice-roy: giving thereby a very bad example to
all men, vvho began to come in thick and three-fold
with great eargernesse unto the Kings party.</p>
               <p>Amongst whom the chiefest for vvealth &amp; povver,
and multitudes of followers &amp; dependants were the
Earl of <hi>Seaford,</hi> the Lord <hi>Rose,</hi> and from the furthest I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands
Sir <hi>Iames Mac-donell,</hi> Chief of a most povverful
and ancient family in the Highlands; <hi>Macklen</hi> also &amp;
<hi>Glenger</hi> the Captain of the <hi>Mac-Renalds,</hi> (&amp; many more)
who were some of them already in <hi>Montroses</hi> Army
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:33308:99"/>
with their Forces, others had sent for theirs. And by
this means before the end of <hi>March, Montrose</hi> might
have falle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> down into the Low-lands with a farre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Army then ever the <hi>Scots</hi> produc'd in the memory
of man. But the unexpected revolt of so great a perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
did not lesse encourage the Rebells to persevere
in their course, then scandalize and discourage honest
and loyall hearts. Whence it happened that those
whose men were already come up to the Army began
to draw off, &amp; steal away privately, and others to make
excuses for their delay. All which put together made
<hi>Montrose</hi> to cast about another way. For he resolved
(seeing he could doe no good with vain, light, waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and inconstant men by gentlenesse &amp; good offices)
to reduce the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> to his obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ce by his authority backed
vvith the strength of armes and severe penalties; and to
that end to force all the Highlanders and North coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimen,
to take up armes, by marching in amongst the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
with a confiding party of good souldiers. For he vvel
knew that many Governours &amp; leading men in their
respective Countries, and Chiefs of Septs were of his
side unto whom this course would be very acceptable.
Nor did he question but the chief and most powerfull
of the <hi>Gordons</hi> being weary of their Lords miscarriage,
would doe him the best service they could if need
was, though it ran counter unto <hi>Huntleys</hi> designe.
However he was resolved to use al fair means, if that
would doe, before he would put them to the cost of
that last and sharpest remedy.</p>
               <p>But because <hi>Inn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>rnesse</hi> was the most considerable gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
of all the North, and the haven there most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:33308:99"/>
for intertaining forraigne Forces, he desired
nothing more then to reduce that: therefore he sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
it with the Forces he had. For the Enemies
Army under the Command of <hi>Middelton</hi> was above
fourscore miles off, &amp; <hi>Huntley</hi> and the <hi>Gordons</hi> half way
between them in a body. Therefore <hi>Montrose</hi> dealt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
with <hi>Huntley</hi> to perswade him not to lose his time,
but (as they had agreed, to joyne with him in the siege
of <hi>Innernesse;</hi> or at least to hover about the <hi>Spey,</hi> over
which the Enemy was to passe, &amp; to hinder their pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
if they advanced to raise the siege; and if they
chanced to get over to joyn their Forces together and
fight the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>. To all which he answered so disdainfully,
that the Vice-roy thought it hig time to despair of any
good fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> him, and conceived himself engaged to look
better to himself lest at last he should betray him. So
that putting no confide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ce in <hi>Huntley,</hi> he sent back three
Troops of Horse to lie at the Fords of the <hi>Spey,</hi> to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> of the Enemy; &amp; if they came, to send
him often &amp; certain intelligence. And they quartering
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>selves in the most advantageous places for scouting
were carefull enough to observe his commands; untill
<hi>Lewes Gordon, Huntleys</hi> son, who then commanded the
Castle of <hi>Lothes,</hi> plaid a more shamefull prank then any
he ever did before. He assured those Captains of horse
whom <hi>Montrose</hi> had set to guard the Fords of the <hi>Spey,</hi>
that the enemy lay very far off and intended nothing
lesse then to passe that river &amp; raise the siege; &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he perswaded the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> (who took him for a most faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
friend) to let alone their needlesse guards (to which
they had been appointed) and to come to his Castle
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:33308:100"/>
to refresh themselves; and with many complements
invited them to a feast which he had provided for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>

of wine and strong waters. And with a great deal of
jollity and ceremonious courtesie, detain'd them so
long till <hi>Middelton</hi> with a great Army of Horse and
Foot had got over the <hi>Spey,</hi> and had gotten footing in
<hi>Murray.</hi> Which assoo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> as he had notice of, he at length

now then he had at</hi> Selkirk Meane time the enemy march
straight and eagerly towards <hi>Montrose,</hi> &amp; those Horse
getting past them with much ado, came not much
before them to <hi>Innernesse,</hi> insomuch as they seem'd to
be but the Van of the enemy, and <hi>Middeltons</hi> whole<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
Army followed within cannon shot. But, as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of God would have it, <hi>Montrose</hi> had notice of
their approach another way and having drawn off his
Forces a little way from the Town had got them al in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a body. And when he perceiv'd the Enemy to be
much too strong for him in Horse, avoiding the plain,
he retreated with his men beyond the <hi>Nesse.</hi> The ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my

the enemy was much stronger then he, the Country
people being faithlesse &amp; rotten, and <hi>Seafords</hi> new rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
men running a way by companies from their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
moved him with all the speed he could to save
himself from the Enemies Horse. Therefore passing
by <hi>Logh-Nesse,</hi> and through <hi>Strath-Glasse,</hi> &amp; <hi>Harrage,</hi>
he advanced unto the bank of the <hi>Spey.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montrose</hi> was resolved to proceed against <hi>Huntley</hi> as
a publick enemy, unlesse he repented; but would try
all fair means first, to see whether it was possible to
bring him into a better minde. To which end taking
with him only one Troop of Horse for his life-guard,
in al speed he rid twenty miles unto him to his castle at
<hi>Bogy.</hi> And as he was on his way, he sent one before to
give him notice of his approach; &amp; to tell him that he
came thither alone &amp; without his Forces, to no other
end then then to kisse his hand, and to be advised by
him concerning such things as concerned the Kings
service; &amp; he was the more earnest to speak with him,
because he had newly received letters from the King
from <hi>Oxford,</hi> which he would let him see. But <hi>Huntley</hi>
being affrighted with the first news of <hi>Montroses</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
was so averse fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> the presence of so gallant a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
that in a trice he leapt on horse-back, &amp; with one man
along with him, ran a way any way he car'd not whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
nor vouchsafed the Kings Viceroy the favour of
a conference or entertainment. Which assoon as <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trose</hi>
understood, he returned back those twenty miles
the same day being the 27 of <hi>May;</hi> and was as carefull
as he could possibly to conceale this frovvasrdnesse &amp;
unrulinesse of <hi>Huntleys,</hi> lest it should be a bad president.
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:33308:101"/>
themselves and others of <hi>Huntleys</hi> friends, being most
of them very honest men and complete Gentlemen,
told all with a great deal of indignation, and detestatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
of <hi>Huntley;</hi> that by that means they might acquit the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from the aspersion of so unworthy an act.</p>
               <p>Nor can one easily say how great influence that
mans example had upon other Northern men: The
Earl of <hi>Seaford,</hi> who had bee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> but lately, &amp; with much
adoe reconciled to the Kings side, was conceived to
begin to falter; and some say that being still unsetled,
he had then underhand dealings for the making of his
peace with the Covenanters, which truly I can hardly
believe. And <hi>Alexander Mac-donell</hi> himself, pretending
I know not what, although he had had often and
serious invitation, made nothing but sleevelesse excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
and put-offs from day to day. Which carriage of
his gave occasion of strange reports of him, as if he,
although he was a bitter enemy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

great correspondence with, and relations unto the <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meltons;</hi>
and therefore staid at home, and looked only
upon the preservation of the <hi>Mac-donells,</hi> not medling
with publique affaires. Which whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> 
                  <hi>Montrose</hi> conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
he resolved without further delay to make his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse
over all the North country and Highlands with
a considerable party, to list souldiers, to encourage the
well disposed, to reduce those that were refractory by
the severity of the Lawes &amp; condigne punishment; &amp;
to deal with them as men use to do with, sick children
make them take physick whether they wil or no. And
he wanted not fitting instrumnets to promore this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe,
who had earnestly labored with him to take that course.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:33308:101"/>
While these things passed at <hi>Innernesse, Huntley,</hi> lest
he should be thought never to have done any thing by
his own conduct without the assistance of <hi>Montrose,</hi>
besieged and took in <hi>Aberdene,</hi> (which <hi>Middleton</hi> kept
with five hundred men) but with more losse to <hi>Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>
himself then to the Enemy. For, besides the losse
of many valiant Souldiers, he gave his Highlanders
leave to pillage the City. But what fault those poore
innocent <hi>Aberdene</hi>-me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> had made either against the King
or <hi>Huntley</hi> let them judge, who know that almost all
of them were eminent and observed for their loyalty.
But for the enemy who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> he took in Armes, who were
both many, and of very good account amongst their
own party, he dismist them freely without any condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and look't fawningly upon them, rather like a
Petitioner then a Conquerour. Nor vvhen he had
many Colonels, Knights, and others of quality (who
by chance were found in <hi>Aberdene</hi>) in his hands, did
he so much as think of exchanging any one of his own
friends for them, many of whom were prisoners ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in <hi>Scotland</hi> or <hi>England.</hi> But this was his humour,
being alwayes more ready to doe good for his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies

or threats of the Rebells into whose hands he had fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len.
But what should he do in that case? If he obeyed
he must give over the estates of his friends to plunder
&amp; their lives to death; &amp; if he stood in arms against the
Kings commad, he should be guilty of that crime he
undertook to scourge in others, Rebellion. And espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
he was afraid lest the Rebels should put his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
upon the Kings account, &amp; use him the worse for
them, seeing they had him in their power: of which
the King had given him a fair hint in his letter.</p>
               <p>Therefore <hi>Montrose</hi> resolved to call together all the
Noblemen, and Chiefs of Septs, &amp; Knights, &amp; others
of quality that were of his side; that a matter of that
consequence which concern'd them all might be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cust
by generall consent. To which end, after he had
received so many injuries from him, he dispatcheth Sir
<hi>Iohn Hurrey</hi> and Sir <hi>Iohn Innes,</hi> being men of greatest ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
in his Army, &amp; (as he conceived) most in <hi>Huntleys</hi>
favour, unto him to desire him to be present at that so
serious Consultation, &amp; referr'd unto him the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the time and place. And to tell him moreover,
that <hi>Montrose was willing to come to his Castle if he thought
fit.</hi> Huntley answer'd; <hi>That the King had sent him letters
also to the same effect, which he was resolved to obey; that the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:33308:102"/>
Kings commands were of that nature as not to admit of second
thoughts and after them nothing was left for consultation.</hi>
When they replyed, that <hi>that likely was</hi> Montroses <hi>opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
too, and that he was as ready as any other to give obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to the Kings Commands, if they were not forced; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it concern'd them all to provide in time for the safety of
them and theirs.</hi> And that <hi>the credit aud authority of what
they resolved upon would be greater, even in the opinion of the
enemies themselves, if they made a joynt and unanimous reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.</hi>
He made no other answer then that <hi>he had resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
for himself, and would have nothing to doe with any
body else.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Montrose</hi> there fore sends his answer to the King by
letters, wherein he was very inquisitive of the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he was in amongst the Covenanters, and whether
he conceiv'd himself safe in their hands? and also whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his service could be beneficiall unto him any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
And, if he was fully determin'd to have that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
disbanded which fought for him (whiles the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
in both Kingdomes were in a military posture, and
crow'd over them more &amp; more) what course should
be taken for the security of the lives and fortunes of
his most gallant and faithfull Subjects, who had spent
their bloud and all that was deare unto them for his
sake? For it was a lamentable case if so excellent m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>n
should be left to the mercy of them that had none, not
only to be undone but to be murthered. To this he
received no open answer, besides some Articles which
the messenger brought which were signed by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells,
with wich <hi>Montrose</hi> was to be content But he in
great anger rejected those conditions which the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:33308:103"/>
had made, being so unconsionable as they were;
and not vouchsafing so much as to treat with the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
sent back the bearer to the King, professing that as
he had not taken up armes but by the Kings Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
so he would have no condition prescribed him
to lay them down by any mortall man but the King
himself. Therefore he humbly besought the King (if
he thought it fit that he should disband his Army) that
he would not think much to make and signe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
himself; to which, though they prov'd perhaps
very harsh, he promised absolutely to submit, but he
scorn'd the Commands of any one else whosoever they
were.</p>
               <p>The messenger returning, at last brought with him
Articles signed by the Kings hand, with Injunctions
now the third time, wherein he was required to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
without further delay; and the same messenger
charged him in the Kings name, under pain of high
Treason, to give obedience forth with unto the Kings
Command. And besides his Majesties pleasure, there
was another thing which hastened him which was,
that those that had engaged with him had most of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ivately and by their friends laboured to make their
peace with the Rebells; which was evidently known
by good tokens of the Earl of <hi>Seaford</hi> and others. As
for <hi>Huntley</hi> &amp; <hi>Aboine</hi> they did not only professe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
open enemies to <hi>Montrose,</hi> but also threatned to
fall upon him by force of armes, if he did not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daitely
submit to the Kings authority. And <hi>Antrim</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
newly arrived out of <hi>Ireland</hi> in the Highla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ds with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
either men or arms busied himself to draw away
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:33308:103"/>
all the Highlanders as his kindred and allies to himself
from <hi>Montroses</hi> Army, whom in scorn he call'd <hi>the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of the Low-lands</hi> making by this means an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable
fraction, and apernicious one to his friends
in those parts. All which <hi>Montrose</hi> having well consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
he was forced according to the Kings Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
to disband his Army.</p>
               <p>And truly that was amost sad day, in which having
solemnly prais'd and encourag'd his souldies (as well
as the occasion permitted) he took his leave of them.
For although he bid the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> to be of good comfort how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
and told them he saw some day-light of a blessed
peace, and that he did as much service to the King by
his present submission, as he had done before by his
Martiall atchievements. Yet notwithstanding they all
conceiv'd that that was the last day of the Kings Aut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hority
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and all of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> beleeved for certaine,
that those Commands from the King were wrested
from him upon the apprehension of greater dangers to
his person if he had not given them. And although
some provision had been made by Articles in writing
for their Indempnity, yet they had rather have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone
the worst that could fall, then survive idle &amp; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serviceable
spectators of the miserable condition of
their dearest King. And it was no little vexation to
those generous spirits, to think what an unworthy o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
forraign Nations and their own posterity must
needs have of them, as if all the Scottish Nation had
been unanimously guilty of Rebellion &amp; desertion of
so good a King. Besides, their sorrow was much aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
with the consideration that their Generall,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:33308:104"/>
who was most valiant, most successefull, and therefore
most beloved, should be taken off so unhappily from
the King, from his Country, from themselves, and all
good men. So that his souldiers falling down at his
feet, entreated him with tears in their eyes, that seeing
the safety of the Kings person depended so much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, and he must of necessity depart the Kingdom,
he would be pleased to take them along with him into
what part of the world soever he went. Professing
their readinesse to live and fight any where under his
command, and (if God would have it so) to die too.
And truly many of them were resolved, though to the
certain hazard of their lives and estates, to follow him
even against his will and knowledge, and to offer him
that service in an unknown land that they were able to
afford him no longer in their miserable Country.</p>
               <p>By the Articles to which the King had consented
according to the desires of the Covenanters it was es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
provided, that <hi>Montrose</hi> should depart <hi>Scotland</hi>
before the first of <hi>September,</hi> and that they should finde
him shipping, vvith provision and all things necessary
vvhen he went. These things were transacted the first
of <hi>August,</hi> and a Port in <hi>Angus</hi> designed for <hi>Montrose</hi>
whither they were to send shipping from whence he
vvas to imbark. And <hi>Montrose</hi> to prevent and remove
all occasions of exception or suspition, being accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
only with his own servants &amp; a very few frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ds,
betook himself thither, and waited for the shipping.
About this time his most implacable Enemies set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
crafty &amp; feigned reports by their fit instruments
wherein they confidently averred, that <hi>the States of the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:33308:104"/>
Kingdome</hi> (as they call'd themselves) <hi>would by no means
suffer that so gallant a Subject should be banished the Country:
For they knew not how great need they might have of a man of
his worth, especially if the King who had cast himself freely upon
the affections of the</hi> Scots <hi>could not get any right of the</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish,
<hi>but should be put to seek it by force and armes; and if it
came to that, no age had afforded a better Generall then</hi> Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trose.
And truly that was the earnest desire and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of most men, who were not able to dive into
the bottom of the Rebels plots, but they had farre o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
designes in hand, and another game to play. For
what their thoughts were tovvards the King, the sad
event made too manifest, and for <hi>Montrose,</hi> they laid
very unconscionable &amp; unworthy traps to catch him.
For they did this, that if they could flatter him up with
such vain hopes, &amp; entice him to stay in the Kingdome
beyond his time appointed, they might take hold of
him upon the Articles, &amp; cut him of with more credit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>August</hi> vvas almost spent and no news at all vvas to
be had about the shipping or safe conduct: therefore
<hi>Montrose,</hi> (although he was resolved to be gone by the
day the King had limited) that he might the more fully
grope the intentions of the Covenanters, gave leave to
some of his friends to deale with them for further
time. But when they brought him nought but uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
&amp; doubtfull answers, he had reason to think they
intended nothing but to delude &amp; intrap him. Besides
(vvhich made his suspition so much the greater) there
came a ship upon the very last day allowed for his stay
(to wit, on the last of <hi>August</hi>) into the haven of <hi>Montrose.</hi>
The Master of it was not only a stranger to him, but a
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:33308:105"/>
most rude and violent abettor of the Rebels; the Sea-men
and Souldiers men of the same temper, malicious
dogged, &amp; ill-condition'd, the ship it self neither victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alled,
nor fit to goe to Sea. So that vvhen <hi>Montrose</hi>
shew'd himself ready to depart, and bad them hoise
their Sailes assoon as they could, the Master of the ship
told him that he must have some dayes allowed him
to pitch and rigge his ship, before he durst aduenture
himself to the winde and vvaves. And then making
great brags of himself and his ship, he drew forth a
Commission vvhich the Covenanters had given him,
vvherein he vvas required to transport the passengers
to certain places assigned by themselves, and to carry
no body else. Moreover there lay great English ships
and men of war every day in sight about the month of
the River of <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>k</hi> (vvhich makes the haven of <hi>Montrose</hi>)
attending there in favour of the Rebels for their much
desired booty, that by no means he might escape their
hands.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Montrose</hi> had sufficient notice of these treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and wanted not some friends of the Covenanters
themselves, who informed him by frequent messages
that the Sea was sore pester'd with the English Navy,
and he could not escape safely either into <hi>France</hi> or the
<hi>Low-Countries;</hi> that the haven was upon the matter
block't up in which he was to take shipping, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was very perillous for him to go to Sea; that
his Enemies look't for nothing else, then that either by
making too long stay in his own Country he should
fall into the hands of the Scottish Covenanters, or by
going he should be surprised unarm'd &amp; unawares by
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:33308:105"/>
the English Rebells. <hi>Montroses</hi> friends that were with
him were of opinion that it was best for him in so ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant
a danger to return into the Highlands, &amp; draw
his men together again conceiving that he had better
trust the fortune of war then so perfidious a peace. But
be forbore to take that course, especially because of
his most ardent affection to the King: For he was assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
if the war brake forth again, it would be laid upon
the King though undeservedly, and so he should bring
his Person into present danger perhaps as much as his
life was worth. Therefore being straightned on eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
side, one vvay vvith treachery plotted against his
ovvne, another against the Kings anointed head, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
with an unalterable resolution to bearall the
burden upon his own shoulders. And therefore he
vvithdrevv himself not out of rashnesse as if he des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair'd
of safety at the worst, but out of sage &amp; discreet
deliberation.</p>
               <p>For when he had smelt out the plots of the Rebels
before-hand, he had sent some a good while agoe to
search diligently the Havens in the North, and if they
chanced to finde any outlandish-vessell to agree with
the Master for the fraught, and to appoint him to be
ready to put to Sea at such a day, and to transport the
passengers (which should be ready with him) by the
help of God into <hi>Norway.</hi> By good fortune there
was found in the haven of <hi>Stanhyve</hi> a small bark of <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi>
in <hi>Norway,</hi> and the Master was soon agreed with,
for he was very glad of the opportunity, having hopes
for getting.</p>
               <p>Thither <hi>Montrose</hi> sent away Sir <hi>Iohn Hurrey Iohn Drum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:33308:106"/>
of <hi>Ball Henry Graham</hi> his brother, <hi>Iohn Spotswoad</hi>
nephew to that great Sir <hi>Robert, Iohn Lily,</hi> a Captain of
approved skill and courage, <hi>Patrick Melvin</hi> such an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
<hi>George Wischeart</hi> Docter of Divinity, <hi>David Gut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therey</hi>
a stout young Gentleman, <hi>Pardus Lasound</hi> a

after wards entertained for his Masters sake by <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trose</hi>
himself, one <hi>Rodolph</hi> a German an honest &amp; trusty
young man; &amp; a few servants more. And these he had
pick't out to carty a long with him whithersoever he
vvent, for this reason especially, because he knevv the
Rebels to be so maliciously bent against most of them
then they could not be safe for never so little a vvhile
in that Country. And they on the third of <hi>September</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a good vvinde put forth to sea for <hi>Norway;</hi> And
the same evening <hi>Montrose</hi> himself accompanied only
with one <hi>Iames Wood</hi> a worthy Preacher by a small
cock-boat got into a Bark which lay at anchot without
the Haven of <hi>Montrose;</hi> and being clad in a course suit
