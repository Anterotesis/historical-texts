            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

haſty with them: Wherefore I adviſe you to deale gently and quietly at all times, and upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions throughout every Cure that you take in hand.</p>
            <p>If the Horſe eyes be lanke or thick, then looke that his Ey-teeth be not grieved, or that the Wolves teeth trouble him not: if they doe, pull them out, and let him blood under the eye and in the noſe with a naule, and annoint his eyes with the fat of a freſh Eele. <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi>

            <p>And if hee have a <hi>Canker,</hi> take hogs-greaſe, roch-al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum, white copreſſe, bole armoniacke, and temper them together, untill they be ſo mixed that you cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the one from the other, and put ſome of the ſalve into the eye once in two dayes, and this ſerves for any ſpeck or pin or wefe: and if the Haw be ranke cut it out, and ſpirt in wine or beere, and it will doe well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. <hi>Proved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the <hi>Canker</hi> in the noſe, take Whitewine vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat, white copreſſe, roch allum, ſage leaves, woodbine leaves, and coltsfoot, then boyle them together, and ſtreine the water, dreſſing the <hi>Canker</hi> once a day for two dayes, and afterwards but once in two dayes: this will alſo cure the <hi>Canker</hi> in the mouth, or any other part, ſo that you put in ſome Touchwood leaves into the ſame with a little honey. <hi>Proved.</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Lampers</hi> are to be cut or burned or ſalted, and the <hi>Flapes</hi> or <hi>Bags</hi> are the like, but it is good to let blood in the third griſe in the mouth, before you ſalt him.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fives</hi> are hard round ſwellings betweene the jaw and the neeke under the Eares. For the Cure of which, you ſhall firſt launch the skin a little againſt

the Kirnell, and then ſeare the Kirnoll with a ſmall hot Iron, untill it begins to looke yellow, and then annoynt it with oyle of Camomile once in two dayes untill it be whole, but alwayes let him blood in the necke on both ſides, and after hee is whole, you may make a charge of Pitch and Roſin, bolearmoniacke, Maſticke, and lay it on with Flockes, letting it lye un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till it fall away of it ſelfe, and then annoynting it once a weeke with a little hogs greaſe, camomile, and ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge boyled together; which will ſerve for any ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling about the head, if it be annoynted once a day, and will either ripen the ſore, or cauſe the Swelling to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh away.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Gare</hi> lyeth in the throat, and may appeare any where about the head or breſt, but if it appeare in the breſt, wee call it <hi>Anticor;</hi> theſe Sorances come ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, and are cured alike; Firſt launch the skinne, and then fley it ſo farre as the ſwelling goes, and with a warme Iron ſeare the ſwelling or gelly, but not the skinne, rubbing the place well with white wood aſhes and bay ſalt: and feare not the Cure if hee live but twelve houres after: and then you muſt provide ſome oyle of Turpentine, and liquor the place where it is ſwelled: then may you take this Drinke, one pint of Treakle, and a pint of ſack, a ſpoonfull of the powder of bay-berries, and a ſpoonfull of Turmericke, and boyle theſe together, and give it the Horſe to drink, and it will drive the gellid humors out, and the heat of the fire; the aſhes and ſalt likewiſe will draw them ou ward, and ſo cure him. <hi>Provel.</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Shoulder-ſprained,</hi> is when he trailes his toe on the ground, and carries it wide from his body, and if he
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:119731:6"/>
pricke his toe forward, then it is a ſigne that hee may be <hi>Shoulder-pitched,</hi> which is eaſily ſeene; for if hee be much lower and cloſe in the top of one ſhoulder then the other, hee is <hi>Shoulder-pitched,</hi> and then you muſt tye his fore-legs together, and ſo draw him upon ſome beame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by which meanes his ſhoulder may come in his place againe: which done, you ſhall let him blood in the plate-veine, and put in a rowell and blow his ſhoulder, annoynting it with oyle of ſpike, nerve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oyle, and hogs-greaſe beaten together, and if it be but ſprained, then you need but let him blood in the plate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaine, and annoynt him, and he will doe well againe in 12 dayes, if not, then rowel him as before expreſſed.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Parſie</hi> is a ſwelling in any part of the body, and breakes out with knobs, which is thus cured, let him blood in thoſe veines next the place infected, and take blacke ſope, tarre, bay-ſalt, and white copreſſe, and mixe them together as you vſe them, and annoynt the places well once in two dayes, and it will helpe him at three times dreſſing, but it is good to launch the knobs that be ſoft, and let out the filth.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Splint</hi> is apparant to every man, and is thus cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, Launch the skinne thorow ſo long as the <hi>Splint</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and when you ſhall ſee the knob, take your draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Iron red hot, and ſeare the knob till it begin to looke yellow, and then lay a Charge of pitch and roſin, bole-armoniacke, maſticke, and ſanguis draconis boyled together, and ſome Flockes of the ſame colour, letting it lye untill it fall away of it ſelfe, and then annoynt the place with oyle of turpentine once in two dayes, untill it be whole, and the haire will come againe, and it will be plaine, and no ey-ſore, but a ſmall race like

But if it chance to ketch any grit or durt, then waſh it with wine vinegar, roch-allum, and butter, launch two holes, one above the <hi>Splint,</hi> and one beneath and open the skinne ſo farre as the knob goeth, and put in the root of Bares-foot, and let it ſtay in five dayes, annointing it with butter once a day.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Ring-bones</hi> are apparent, and the Cure is, if they be newly come, take up the Shackle veines on both ſides of the foot, and with a Fleame prick the ſwell'd places, ſo as they may bleed, then boyling hot, lay the Charge rehearſed for the <hi>Splint:</hi> but if the ſwelling be big, you muſt open the foot, and draw the ſwelling with a hot Iron, and annoynt the place with Tarre and Turpentine boyled together, when the Charge falleth away, and not before. And if you thinke that the Horſe is a little founderd, or hoofe bound, then you may let him blood in the toe veines, and ſtop his feet with Tarre, Turpentine, and Hogs-greaſe with ſome Hemlockes or Arſe-mart in it, boyled together ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hot, and renew it once in two dayes.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Quiter-bone</hi> is an Vlcer in rhe foot, which run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth at a little hole with white matter, and in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the hole there lyeth a griſtle like a bone, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſearch it to the bottome, and fill the hole with Verdegreaſe, letting it remaine ſo three dayes, then take it out, and if you ſee that it is not come cleane a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, ſtop the hole againe with the ſame, and take away the hoofe as farre as you ſee it hollow, and wrap the ſore with browne paper dipped in tarre, turpentine, and hogs-greaſe beaten together after the bone is come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way untill it be whole.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spraine of the Back-Sinew</hi> is a very evill thing,

The Horſe that is <hi>Stiſted</hi> cannot gather up his leg, but trailes his toe on the ground: the Cure is thus, Put in the bone, and take up the skin with a paire of pinſers, and burne a hole thorow it, annointing the place well with comfrey and butter boiled together, then ſide-ſpan the other legs for three dayes, and this will cure him; but if hee be bruiſed or ſtrained, let him blood on the haunch veine, and blow and rowell the Horſe, and annoint him with hogs greaſe and oyle of Spike beaten together, and warme it in with ſome warme Iron.</p>

For this cauſe, and to prevent the like errour, from the outward Sorances and Diſeaſes commonly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to Horſes (whereof I have before treated, and explained their ſeverall Cures) I proceed to the Inward Grievances, and their Remedies: For the more plaine and eaſie underſtanding of which, I have laid open every part, Bone, or Sinew, belonging to a Horſe, ſo that every man, though but of a meane capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, may both finde out the cauſe of any Diſeaſe, and the way to Cure it, by thoſe Medicines which I have here preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and by mine owne Expeience often proved, being ſuch things as with eaſe are commonly to be had in moſt Gardens, or almoſt in every Grocers and Apothecaries Shop.

And ſo for your inſtructions by the Anatomy here prefixed (for it is neceſſary that every Farrier ſhould know not onely the office, but the number of all the Bones &amp; ſmalleſt griſtles or Sinewes in every part of the Horſe) I have layd open the Horſe, and placed the letter <hi>A,</hi> over his Head, which ſhowes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how the Eyes hang to the Braines; as as when hee is living (with other letters to deſcribe the Entrailes, and other members as they lye in order in the Horſe.)</p>

            <p>The <hi>Staggers</hi> is a Pluriſie of blood thorow-out the whole body, and infumes the ſenſes of the Horſe, ſo that he can neither ſtand nor goe without ſtaggering, his feeling is taken away, his ſight growes dimme, and hee will runne againſt walls and hedges, ſtaying himſelfe on his head; and if he be farre gone, he will ſleepe and ſtart as though he were in a dreame: the Cure where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as I have found by experience, is thus. Let him blood in the necke, noſe, eyes, and mouth, and if you ſee that hee lookes yellow, then it is a ſigne that the <hi>Yellowes</hi> are come upon him too, therefore to uſe the cure for both it is not amiſſe: then if his eares bee cold, take aquavitae and ſalt, and put it into his eares, and tye them for twelve hours; but if you can get no a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quavitae, take water and ſalt, which will doe well, then launch the skinne in his forehead, and open it two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and put in garlicke, and annoynt the outſide with hogs greaſe; which done, you muſt make a Drinke for him of Tanſie, turmerick, long pepper, graines, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed, liquoriſh, and ſtrong ale, boyled well together, and milk warme give it the horſe ſtirring him up and downe a good ſpace; and if he live but ſix hours af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his dreſſing there is likely no danger: and then

Where they keepe cattell low and poore in winter, and have ranke feeding in ſommer, and ſtanding water which they ſtale in, having no ſpring in it to refreſh the ſame; and ſo the blood being not good at the firſt time of the yeare, the ranke feeding, and the unwholſome water, infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the whole ſubſtance of the beaſt, that is, blood, choller, flegme, black choller, nay breath and all, and then cometh the Murren and peſtilence: at the firſt it may ſwell in the breſt, throat, lips, or under the eares or eyes, and they that dye of it are alwayes full of gelly at the heart and lights of all colours: the Cure for the <hi>Garget</hi> I have already ſhewed in the outward Sorances; but this is how to prevent the murren or peſtilence: take Rue, wormewood, garlick, pelletory, mug-wort, marigolds, red dock-roots, Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, elderne barke or berries, turmericke, bayberries, graines, cominſeed, anniſeed, liquoriſh, long pepper, venecricke, treakle new tarre, ſome beares foot, then beat them together, and boyle them in beere with ſome bay ſalt among them, then ſtraine them thorow a cloth, and every morning when your cattell are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected give a reaſonable quantity to each, and let them blood in the necke and mouth, or for your horſe you may boile a reaſonable quantity in wine, and give it
