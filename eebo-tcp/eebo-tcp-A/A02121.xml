            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AFter I had written this Ode, a déepe insight of my fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies did pearce into the center of my thoughtes, that I felt a passionat remorse, discouering such perticuler vanities as I had soothed vp withall my forepassed humors, I began to consider that that <hi>Astrea,</hi> that virtue, that metaphisicall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence which maketh one man differ from an other in excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence béeing I meane come from the heavens, &amp; was a thing infested into man from God, the abuse whereof I found to be as preiudicial as the right vser thereof was profitable, that it ought to be imployed to wit, in painting out a goddesse, but in setting out the praises of God: not in discouering of beauty but in discouering of vertues: not in laying out the plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes of loue, nor in telling the déepe passions of fancy, but in perswading men to honest &amp; honorable actions which are the steps that lead to the true and perfect felicity: the serpent is then therefore an odious creature, for that he sucketh poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son from that Odorifferous flower, from whence the painefull Bee gathers her sweete Honnie.

            <p>Sitting as a man in a maze at the view of these two an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Poets, as well at the grauitie of their lookes, as the strangenesse of their attire.

My friend quoth he, thy counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance bewray thy thoughts, and thy outward lookes thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward passions: for by thy face I see the figure of a discontented minde, and the very glaunce of thine eyes is a map of a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted conscience. Take héede, I tell thée sorrowes concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led are the more sower, and gréefes smoothered, if they burst not out, will make the heart to breake: I confesse it is best to bee secretarie to a mans selfe, and to reueale the inwarde thoughts to a stranger is more follie, yet I tell thée, better brooke an inconuenience then a mischiefe, and be counted a little fond, then too froward. Therefore if thy gréefe be not to priuate, or so néere to thy selfe, that thou wilt not bewray it to thy shirte: manie festring sores launched are the sooner cured, and cares discouered are the sooner eased: thou hast heere two, whome experience hath taught many medicines

               </gap>ering sir <hi>Geffrey Chaucer</hi> thus familiar, I tooke heart at grasse to my selfe, and thought nowe I might haue my doubt well debated, betwéene two such excellent schollers: wherevpon putting of my hat with great reuerence, I made this replie.</p>
            <p>Graue Lawreats, the tipes of Englands excellence for Poetry, and the worlds wonders for your wits, all haile, and happily welcome, for your presence is a salue for my passions, and the inward gréefes that you perceiue by my outward lookes, are alreadie halfe eased by your comfortable promise: I cannot denie but my thoughts are discontent, and my sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in a great maze, which I haue damd vp a long while, as thinking best to smoother sorrow with silence, but now I will set fire on the straw, and lay open my secrets to your selues, that your swéet counsailes may ease my discontent. So it is, that by profession I am a scholler, &amp; in wil do affect that which I could neuer effect in action, for faine would I haue some taste in the liberall sciences, but <hi>Non licet cuibis adire Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thum,</hi> and therefore I content my selfe with a superficiall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight, and only satisfie my desire with the name of a Scholler, yet as blinde Baiard wil iumpe soonest into the mire, so haue I ventured afore many my betters, to put my selfe into the presse, and haue set foorth sundrie bookes in print of loue &amp; such amourous fancies which some haue fauoured, as other haue misliked. But now of late there came foorth a booke called the Cobler of Canterburie, a merry worke, and made by some madde <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ellow, conteining plesant tales, a litle tainted with scurilitie, such reuerend <hi>Chawcer</hi> as your selfe set foorth in your iourney to <hi>Canterbury.</hi> At this booke, the grauer and greater sorte repine, as thinking it not so pleasant to some, as preiudiciall to many, crossing it with such bitter in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues, that they condemne the Author almost for an Atheist. Now learned Lawreat, héere lyes the touch of my passione: they father the booke vppon me, whereas it is <hi>Incerti authoris,</hi> and suspitiouslye slaunder me with many harde reproches,
<pb facs="tcp:6140:11"/>
for penning that which neuer came within the compasse of my Quill. Their allegation is, because it is pleasant, and therfore mine: because it is full of wanton conceits, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mine: in some place say they the stile bewraies him, thus vpon supposed premisses they conclude peremptorie, &amp; though some men of accoumpt may be drawne by reason from that suppose, yet that <hi>Ignobile Vulgus,</hi> whose mouthes will not be stopt with a Bakers batch, will still crie, it was none but his: this father <hi>Chawcer</hi> hath made me enter into conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of all my former follies, and to thinke how wantonly I haue spent my youth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in penning such fond pamphlets, that I am driuen into a dumpe whether they shall redound to my insuing credit, or my future infamie, or whether I haue doone well or ill, in setting foorth such amourous trifles, heerein re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue me, and my discontent is doone.</p>
            <p>At this long period of mine, <hi>Chawcer</hi> sat downe &amp; laught, and then rising vp and leaning his back against a Trée, he made this merry aunswer. Why <hi>Greene</hi> quoth he, knowest thou not, that the waters that flow from <hi>Pernassus</hi> Founte, are not tyed to any particular operation? that there are nine Muses, amongst whom as there is a <hi>Clio</hi> to write graue mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, so there is a <hi>Thalis</hi> to endite pleasant conceits, and that <hi>Apollo</hi> hath Baies for them both, aswell to crowne the one for hir wanton amours, as to honour the other for her wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy labours: the braine hath many strings, and the wit many stretches, some tragical to write, like <hi>Euripedes</hi>: some comi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call to pen, like <hi>Terence</hi>: some déepely conceited to set out matters of great import: others sharpe witted to discouer pleasant fantasies: what if <hi>Cato</hi> set foorth seueare censures, and <hi>Ouid</hi> amorous Axiomes, were they not both counted for their faculties excellent? yes, and <hi>Ouid</hi> was commended for his <hi>Salem ingen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>i,</hi> when the other was counted to haue a dull wit, &amp; a slow memory: if learning were knit in one string, and could expresse himself but in one vaine, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should want of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety, bring all into an imperfect Chaos. But sundry men, sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry conceits, &amp; wits are to be praised not for the grauity of the
<pb facs="tcp:6140:11"/>
matter, but for the ripenes of the inuention: so that <hi>Martiall, Horace</hi> or any other, deserue to bee famoused for their Odes and Elegies, as wel as <hi>Hesiode, Hortensius,</hi> or any other for their deeper precepts of doctrines. Feare not then what those Moroste wil murmure, whofe dead cinders brook no glowing sparkes nor care not for the opinion of such as hold none but Philosophie for a Subiect: I tell thée learning will haue his due, and let a vipers wit reach his hand to <hi>Apollo,</hi> and hee shall sooner haue a branch to eternize his fame, than the sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest Satyricall Authour in the worlde. Wee haue heard of thy worke to be amorous, sententious, and well written. If thou doubtest blame for thy wantonnes, let my selfe suffice for an instaunce, whose Canterburie tales are broad enough before, and written homely and pleasantly: yet who hath bin more canonised for his workes, than Sir <hi>Geffrey Chaucer.</hi> What <hi>Green</hi>? Poets wits are frée, and their words ought to be without checke: so it was in my time, and therfore resolue thy selfe, thou hast doone Scholler-like, in setting foorth thy pamphlets, and shalt haue perpetual fame which is learnings due for thy endeuour. This saying of <hi>Chawcer</hi> chéered mee vntill olde <hi>Iohn Gower</hi> rising vp with a sowre countenance began thus.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ell hath <hi>Chawcer</hi> said, that the braine hath sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie strings, and the wit diuerse stretches: some bent to pen graue Poems, other to endite wanton fancies, both honoured and praised for the height of their capacitie: yet as the Diamond is more estimated in the Lapidaries shop than the Topace, and the Rose more valued in the Garden than Gillyflowers: So men that write of Morall precepts, or Philosophicall Aphorismes are more highly estéemed, than such as write Poems of loue, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of fancie. In elder time learning was so high prized that Schollers were companions for Kings, &amp; Philosophers were fathers of the Commonwealth, vpholding the state with the
<pb facs="tcp:6140:12"/>
strength of their precepts: their wits were then imployed ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the censures of virtue, or to the secrets of nature: ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to deliuer opinions of Morall Discipline, or conclusions of natural philosophy, being measured by the grauity of their sayings, not the wantonnes of their sentences: And so long were poets titled with many honors as long as their poems were vertuous, either tending to suppresse vanitie with <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siod,</hi> or to aduance arms and vallour with <hi>Homer.</hi> But when they began to wrest their sonnets to a wrong vse, then they were out of credite, and for an instaunce of their follies, <hi>Ouid</hi> there graunde Captaine, was rewarded with bannishment. They which considred that man was born to profit his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, sought how to apply their time, and bend their wits to attaine to perfection of learning, not to inueagle youth with amours, but to incite to vertuous labours: some in their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cademies, taught the motion of the Starres, the count of the heauens, some the nature of trées, plants, hearbs and stones: others deciphered the secret qualities of beasts, birds, &amp; fouls, others, writs of Aconomical precepts, some of policy, some of gouernement of Common wealthes, and how the Citizens should followe vertue, and eschewe vice: others deliuered instruction for manners. Thus all generallie aim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>desse. Philosophers were dunces in loues doctrine, and held it infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for to be tainted with the blemish of fond fancy: much more to pen down any precepts of affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if then Ethnik phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers, who knewe not God, but by a naturall instinct of vertue sought so carefully to auoid such vanities, &amp; only bent the sum of their wits to their countries profit: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> how blam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy are such as endeuour to shew their quicke capacities in such wanton woorkes, as greatly preiudice the state of the commonwealth.

Therefore trust me,
<pb facs="tcp:6140:12"/>
               <hi>Iohn Gowers</hi> opinion is: thou hast applied thy wits ill, &amp; hast sowed chaffe &amp; shalt reape no haruest. But my maister <hi>Cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I grant quoth <hi>Gower</hi>) the meaning is good, but the method is bad: for by aming at an inconuenience, he bringeth in a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe: in séeking to sppresse fond loue, the swéetnes of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course allures youth to loue, like such as taking drink to cool their thirst, feele the tast so pleasant, that they drinke while they surfeit. <hi>Ouid</hi> drewe not so many with his remedie of Loue from loue, as his <hi>Ars Amandi</hi> bred amorous schollers, nor hath <hi>Greenes</hi> Bookes weaned so many from vanity, as they haue wedded from wantonnesse.

            <p>Thus <hi>Tomkins</hi> came ruffling amongst the wenches to the Churchyard, where he was alwayes foregallant of the Countrie gambals, performing his charge with such a grace, that the proudest wench in all the parish would fauour him with her Napkin.

At last looking about, hee sawe manie faire and well featured, but they had faults that bred his mislike: Some thought to amend Nature with Art, and with Apothecaries drugges, to refine that which God had made perfect: Such artificiall paintings he likt not, as being the instances of pride. Some had their eies full of Amours, casting their lookes with such alluring glaunces, that their verie immodestie appeared in their eie-lids, those hee held too forwarde to the fist: Some had delight to heare themselues chat, and had more talke in their tongues, than witte in their heads, those he counted for Gosseps, and let them slip: taking thus a narrow view of the maides of Antwerpe. At last, he spied one amongst the rest, who was faire, modest, silent, and generallie indued with all vertues, as highly commended through all the Cittie for her chastitie, as she was praised for her beautie. Upon her did <hi>Alexander</hi> cast his eie, and so fixe his heart, that he began entirely to affect her, knowing what a pretious iewell he should haue, if he got so vertuous a wife: For hee had read in Iesus Syrache, that happie is that

The hart being once infected with iealousie, the sléepes are broken: dreames, disquiet slumbers, thoughts, cares, and sorrows: the life woe and myserie, that liuing he dies, and liuing prolongs out his life in passions worse then death. None looketh on his loue, but suspition saies this is he, that commeth to be contriuall of my fauours: none knocks at his doore, but starting vp he thinks them mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers.

shall I race out this passion, that so paines me: and haue the disquiet of my thoughts satisfied. Oh my Sonne (quoth the ould man) thou art commaunded by the wise man, not to be iealious ouer the wife of thy bosome, least shee showe some shrewd point of wickednesse vppon thee: for nothing more greeueth an honest woman, nor draweth more aptly to some mortall resolution, then to be suspected without cause. And I tell thée my Sonne, Antwerpe hath euer spoken well of thy wife, whatsoeuer thou hast misconstred. Thou hast then doone amisse, in absenting thy selfe from her, for thou art chargde not to departe from a good and discréet woman that is fallen vnto thée for thy portion, in the feare of the Lord: for the guift of hir honestie is aboue gould. A woman of fewe wordes, is a guift of God: and to a well nurtured Maide may nothing be comparde. An honest and mannerly woman, is a guift aboue other guifts: and there is no weight to bee compard to a womans minde, that can rule it selfe like as the cléere light vpon the holy Candlestickes: so is the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the face vpon an honest body, like as the goulden pillers vpon the sockets of siluer, so are the faire legs vpon a woman that hath a constant minde.</p>
            <p>A faire Wyfe reioyseth her husband, and a man loueth nothing better: but if shee bee louing and vertuous withall, then is not her husband like to other men. He that hath got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a vertuous woman, hath a goodly possession, she is vnto him a helpe and piller on whome he resteth: where no hedge is, there the goods are spoiled: and where no Husband is, there the friendlesse mourneth. Dooest thou marke my Sonne these Sentences? if thou hast so good a wife: oh, how hast thou sinned, to wrong hir with Ielousie: to taint thine honor, and to blemish the credit of her chastitie. If she bee wanton, and wyll neuer wante one: but sitteth downe as <hi>Syrach</hi> saith, and openeth hir Quiuer to euery Arrowe, then my Sonne shake her off, abide not with such a woman, least yee féele the force of the lawe: but bee not iealous: for that breedes thy fatall ruine, and to her is no preiudice.

            <p>I cannot deny sir, but I haue found Fortune my foe, yet to counteruaile her malice I haue had Patience my friend, and what the world hath obieded with suspition, I haue answered with innocency: for my present misery, as I brooke it with content, so I hope to finde the heauens more fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable: and for my husbands follies, I counte his present iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie counteruailde with his former loues, and hope that God will chaunge his opinions into better censures, and make him conceit of me as fauourable, as now hee thinkes hardlie. In the meane time sir, your aime is farre beyond the marke, and your compasse directed by a wrong starre: for though I be pinched with wante, and toucht with that sting that forceth many to attempt vnlawfull actions, yet had I rather sit with <hi>Cornelia,</hi> and satisfie my hunger with handes labours, then frolick it with <hi>Lamia,</hi> and buy repentance with delicates: no Sir, thinke not that all the pouertie in the world can hale me from the thought of mine ould honour, or any shower of misfortune, driue me from the seate of vertue, better liue in lowe content, then in high infamie: and more pretious is want with honestie, then wealth with discredit: Therefore sir, I thanke you for your proffer, but I am no traffike for such a chapman: but reporte this wheresoeuer you come, that I would scorne a crowne, in respect of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie, and vould the participation of a kingdom light, in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of my chastity: I tell you sir, though I be a woman, yet the loue that I bear, and the dutie that I owe to my husband howsoeuer he hath wrongd mee, makes me so resolute, that neyther extremitie shall diswade me from affecting him, nor any proffer of riches perswade to fancie any other.

Time and my good behauiour shall wipe out the blemish of such causelesse infamie, and then shall I shew my self to mine owne honour, and theyr discredit.

            <p>Then good Sir, you knowe my minde, my pouertie is my content: mine honor, my wealth: and mine innocencie, the onely thing that is left to quiet my conscience: therefore as your Marte was little, your market being doone, the doore is open, and you may go when you please.</p>

The more pittie (quoth <hi>Gower</hi>) that they should bee so fond, as to be subiect to the delight of euery leud fancy, when the true badge of a Gentleman, is learning ioyned with vallour and vertue, and therefore ought they to read of Martiall Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, not of the slight of <hi>Venus</hi>: and to talke of hard labours, not to chat of foolish and effeminate amoures. <hi>Aristotle</hi> read not to <hi>Alexander</hi> wanton Elegies, but he instructed him in Morall precepts, and taught how to gouerne like a King, not how to court like a louer: But now a daies, our youthes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to read amourous pamphlets, rather then Philosophicall actions, and couet like Epicures rather to passe the time in some pleasant fable, then like Philosophers to spend the day in profitable Aphorismes: but when the blacke Oxe hath trode on their foot, and that age hales them on to olde yeares, and the Palme trée, as the Preacher saies, waxeth white, then will they repent those howers they haue spent in tossing ouer such fruitlesse papers.

and said thus: My son, they which respect their fame, are the children of wisdome: &amp; such as feare the danger of report, shal be houlden vertuous. I know thy thoughts by thy lookes, and thy face bewraies thy resolution. The <hi>Pro et contra</hi> these haue had about thy pamphlets, them I heard, though thou hast not séene me, and I haue equally weighed their censures: <hi>Chawcers</hi> opinion hath his, Maister <hi>Gower</hi> refelled, and made them by his counsaile peremptory to leaue the follies of thy penne and all wanton Amours, to betake them to Philosophy and higher laboures: but to diuert thée from that opinion my sonne am I come to put knowledge in thy lippes, and to teach thée wisedome. I am hee that craued it of the Lord, and he gaue me it, and made me wiser then the sons of men. Therfore harken to my words, and let my sayings sink down into thy heart, so shalt thou be honored in the stréets, &amp; bee had in estimation before the Magistrate. Wisedome my sonne is more worth then pretious stones, yea, all the things that thou canst desire, are not to be compared to it. Wisdome hath her dwelling with knowledge, and prudent counsaile is hir own: with her is the fear of the Lord and the eschewing of il. As for pride and disdaine, and a mouth that speaketh foolish things, she vtterly abhorreth them. She giues counsaile, &amp; is a guide, and is ful of vnderstanding and strength<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> through her kings raign: through her, princes make iust laws: through hir, Lords beare rule, &amp; Iudges of the earth execute iudgement: she is louing to those that loue her, and they that séeke hir ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, shall find hir. Riches and honor are with her: yea, excellent goodnes and righteousnes: her fruit is better then golde, &amp; hir encrease more worth, than fine siluer. The Lord himself hath hirin possession, therfore harke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to hir, for blessed is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> man that watcheth at hir doors: who so findeth hir, findeth life, and shall obtaine fauour of the Lord, and who so offendeth against hir, hurteth his own soule: and who so hateth her, is the louer of death. If then my Sonne, Wisedome be so pretious, howe hast thou mispent thy youth, that hast haunted after foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and beaten thy braines about idle fancies, and yet art now resoluing to continue in vanitie: I tell thée, I haue
<pb facs="tcp:6140:31"/>
sought out to finde what is perfect vnder the Sonne: and I haue found nothing but wisdome, without blemish.</p>
            <p>Learning hath many braunches, and teacheth her Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers many strange things, and yet my Sonne, when thou hast waded the depth of hir knowledge, and sought into the secret of her bosome, thou shalt finde all thy labours to be vexation of minde and vanitie. Canst thou number and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, as the cunning Arithmetician: or with Geometrie measure the ground, and leuell out the plaines by the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of thine arte. Canst thou reach vnto the heauens with thy knowledge, and tell the course of the Starres, setting downe their aspects, oppositiues, times, and sextiles, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of the influence of euery Star? canst thou with mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick please thine eare, and with the meladie of hir Cordes make thy heart merrie? Canst thou tell the secrets of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophie, and like a cunning naturalist, discouer the hidden a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorismes of arte, and set out the nature and operation of all things? wel my sonne, say thou canst write of all these things, yet when thou dooest with a carefull insight, enter into the consideration, what the end of all is, thou shalt finde the stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of them to bee vtter vexation of minde, and vanitie: and the fame that growes from such labours, to vanish awaye like smoake, or a vapour tossed with the winde: If then all be follie, séeke Wisdome, and shée will teach thee the feare of the Lord. Therefore my Sonne, follow my counsell from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foorth, as thou hast made a vowe to leaue effeminate fancies, and to proclaime thy selfe an open enemie to loue: so abiure all other studies, séeing <hi>Omnia sub coelo vanitas,</hi> and onely giue thy selfe to Theologie: be a Deuine my Sonne, for her do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuments are seueritie, and her foode is the bread of life: hir principles came from Heauen, and hir wordes came from aboue, so shalt thou make amends for the follyes of thy youth, and as thou hast seduced youth by thy wanton Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets: so shalt thou instruct them by thy godlie laboures. Diuinitie, whie it is a studie that farre surpasseth all the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen liberall sciences, and the least sparke that it doth lighten, is more bright then all their fading glories: it comprehendeth
<pb facs="tcp:6140:32"/>
the lawe of the Lorde: and by it shalt thou knowe what the depth of his will is. Theologie is mother of all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, for from it commeth health of the soule, and through it thou shalt win men vnto heauen. Then my Sonne, leaue all other vaine studies, and applye thy selfe to féede vpon that heauenly Manna, whose taste shall comforte thy heart, and drinke of those waters, which shall spring in thée a well of life, and so shalt thou recouer thy fame that thou hast lost, and be accompted of amongst the Elders of the Cittie Couet not to blinde thy selfe with the illusions that other artes present vnto thée: for so shalt thou haue the portion of the foole, and the end of thy labours shall be vanitie: for all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge except it, is meere follie: and there is no wisdome, but the knowledge of the law of the Lord.</p>
            <p>Therefore be not wise in thine owne conceit, for he that will not héere instruction, shall feele the smart of the rodde. Deuinitie I tell thee, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The first point of wisdome, is, that thou be willing to obtaine wisdome, and when thou hast got her, shee will make thée a gratious head, and garnishe thy temples with a Crowne of glorie: if then my Sonne, all knowledge, all sciences, all artes, all learning except Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie, be méere foolishnesse and vanitie: leaue the quiddities of Lodgick, and aphorismes of Philosophie: and applye thy wits onely to diuinitie.
