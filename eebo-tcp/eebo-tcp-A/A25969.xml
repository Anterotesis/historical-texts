            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>GREAT SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>To whom can this Complaint, made by the Genius of <hi>Ireland,</hi> be so justly Dedicated, as to that General, on whom Her Eyes are fix'd, as design'd to be Her Glorious Deliverer? Whose long Celebrated Name gives her joyful Expectations, ev'n in the midst of Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and encourages Her to an extraordinary Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, by an assurance of being speedily Reliev'd, or nobly Reveng'd?</p>
            <p>And indeed, it is her Happiness that she cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume too much upon that Patronage; a Patronage that will amply satisfie the largest Hopes she can conceive from it, as well as give occasion to that Prince, who (intending the total Extirpation of the Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion from his Dominions) Exil'd the greatest Supporter
<pb facs="tcp:106672:3"/>
of his Throne and That; to repent his rash Ingratitude, when he finds that Religion Establish'd in another Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, by the very means he used to Banish it his own; and sees the <hi>Moses</hi> whom he Expell'd his Court, Rais'd up to deliver <hi>Israel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor do we expect less than Miracles from that Hand, since we know them familiar to It; and that as there is nothing so difficult which It dares not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake, so there is nothing It undertakes, which it does not accomplish.</p>
            <p>'Tis therefore, Mighty Sir, because you have been a Prince of Wonders, that we depend on You for that of <hi>Ireland's</hi> Preservation, and 'tis that Dependance occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions you the trouble of this Address.</p>
            <p>Pardon then, my Lord, this Effect of your own fam'd Merit, as readily as you face the Dangers to which it now exposes you; And as you cannot be displeas'd with that deserv'd Esteem which renders You our Choice and Option for this hazardous Enterprise, so let it not be less grateful that it brings these poor Endeavours to the Shelter of your Illustrious Name; which because it gives Security to all who are happy in its Protection, makes every one its ambitious Suppliant: In which Throng, may it please your Excellency to admit,</p>

               <l>The greatest Trophies to themselves they raise;</l>
               <l>Each has obtain'd a celebrated Name,</l>
               <l>That fills large room in the Records of Fame.</l>

               <l>To these I mean to add one Hero more,</l>
               <l>An Instance of my tend'rest Care;</l>
               <l>A Jewel brought me from a Foreign Shore,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Nestor</hi> Renown'd in War,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Nestor,</hi> who Young made Victory his Bride,</l>
               <l>And She, still Faithful to her Lord,</l>
               <l>So long has waited by his Side,</l>
               <l>Made Conquest so familiar to his Sword,</l>
               <l>That now he claims it for his Own,</l>
               <l>By undeniable Prescription.</l>
               <l>He, once the <hi>Gallick</hi> Monarch's boast,</l>
               <l>And Bulwark of the <hi>Lusitanian</hi> Coast,</l>
               <l>Now from both faithless Soils Exil'd;</l>
               <l>Those faithless Soils unworthy such a Store,</l>
               <l>Whose loss has made them poor!</l>
               <l>While for the Crime they justly are revil'd,</l>
               <l>A Crime, his Merits still upbraid;</l>
               <l>He shall conduct my Armies to thy Aid.</l>
               <l>He bravely will engage in thy Defence;</l>
               <l>For none can have a juster Sense</l>
               <l>Of thy unhappy Exigence,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:106672:10"/>
Of all the Mis'ries thou hast undergone,</l>
               <l>Of all thy Losses for Religion;</l>
               <l>Since, in the Throng of her Admirers, none</l>
               <l>Has for her Glorious Cause Perform'd or Suffer'd more.</l>
