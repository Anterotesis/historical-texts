            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>REMARKS ON Algernoon Sidney's PAPER, Delivered to the SHERRIFFS AT HIS Execution.</head>
            <p>THe great Aim of this Paper, like that of the late Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> is a continued Juſtification of a dying Traytor's Innocence, a virulent and declamatory Harangue againſt the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy of the Nation, loaded with ſo much Obloquie and Injuſtice, thrown upon the Court, the Judges, and the very Government it ſelf; that 'tis a perfect Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the People to revenge his blood, and an open and viſible Exhortation to them to puſh them on to the finiſhing of that Work, which himſelf dy'd for, and which his own ſhortned thread did not hold out to ſee accompliſht; and all under a ſhadow of Truth, but an Intayling of his Guilty Principles to Poſterity.</p>
            <p>But alas! his mighty Proteſtations of all Saint, and no Sinner, are ſo aukwardly and ſo lewdly put together, that half an Eye of ſenſe cannot but ſpy through the Falſity of them. This Gentleman, however, is an Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of his Kind; and if the Candidneſs and not the Inadvertency of the Author, be to be thankt for't, has dealt more plainly with the World than his Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour <hi>Ruſſel</hi>; for inſtead of Prayers for the King, and the Proſperity of the Crown, and a Deteſtation of <hi>Anarchy,</hi> he very ingenuouſly avoids ſo poor a Diſguiſe, and with a bar-fac'd Openneſs, avows his <hi>Republican</hi> Principles, and his utter averſion to <hi>Monarchy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To come to the Paper. The firſt material thing he tells us, is, That <hi>We live in an Age, that makes Truth paſs for Treaſon; which his Tryal and Condemnation</hi> he ſays <hi>ſufficiently evidences.</hi> Tho truly his unhappy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per has rather turn'd the Tables, and proved Mr. <hi>Sid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi> has a greater Mind to make <hi>Treaſon</hi> paſs for <hi>Truth</hi>; a Truth too, ſo divine, that his very laſt Ejaculation is, <hi>His glorifying of the Mercy of God, in permitting him to dye a Witneſs to.</hi> He goes on and ſays,</p>
            <p>Weſt, Rumſey, <hi>and</hi> Keyling, <hi>who were brought to prove the Plot, ſaid no more of me, than that they knew me not; and ſome others equally unknown unto me, had uſed my Name, and that of ſome others, to give a little Reputation unto their Deſigns. The Lord</hi> Howard <hi>is too infamous by his Life, and the many Perjuries not to be denyed, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſworn by himſelf, to deſerve mention; and being a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Witneſs would be of no value, though he had been of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemiſhed Credit, and had not ſeen and confeſſed that the Crimes committed by him would be pardon'd only by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting more; and even the Pardon promiſed could not be obtained till the Drudgery of Swearing was over.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the firſt place, under that Ignominious Reflection, <hi>Of giving Reputation to their Deſigns</hi>; the Diſcovery of the whole <hi>Phanatical Plot</hi> is inſinuated to be all Juggle and Combination. Tho the World may take notice of a wonderful Difference betwixt the Quality of theſe Diſcoverers, and thoſe of the <hi>Popiſh-Plot.</hi> Their <hi>Oats</hi> and <hi>Bedlows,</hi> though no better than the Rakings of Jayls, and no higher than Companions for <hi>Valets,</hi> were nevertheleſs thought worthy to be <hi>Secret-keepers,</hi> and <hi>Cabinet-Counſellors</hi> of Princes, and honour'd with the univerſal Belief of a whole applauding Nation for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of a helliſh Plot, traced up to no leſs than a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy of 30000 Bloody-Pilgrims, and as many formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable <hi>Black-Hills,</hi> like the head of <hi>Nilus</hi> up to the <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> of the <hi>Moon.</hi> Whereas, on the contrary, theſe laſt Witneſſes were Men of undiſputed <hi>Reputation, Birth</hi> and <hi>Honour,</hi> Men ſo far from <hi>Oats</hi> his hopes of a Parliamentary Donative of 30000 pound, that the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery was made without the leaſt proſpect of a Reward. Beſides, if theſe Witneſſes were Villains, how comes the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> to be the <hi>Only</hi> Evidence againſt Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Sidney,</hi> and <hi>Weſt, Rumſey,</hi> and <hi>Keyling</hi> to keep ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52203:2"/>
when in the Caſe of <hi>Deſigns,</hi> as he calls them, and that they had ſworn without Fear, or Conſcience; or had had but half that <hi>Salamanca</hi> Courage that brought the <hi>Queen</hi> into the Poiſoning the <hi>King,</hi> no doubt theſe three Mutes had opened their Mouths too, and not left the Collonel ſuch a <hi>Loop-hole</hi> for Innocence, as a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of a <hi>Single-Teſtimony.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Maſter-ſtroak of the Colonel's Pen againſt the Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> is one of the moſt accurate pieces of Mallice that the moſt ſtudyed Revenge could have put together. But if the Lord <hi>Howard's</hi> Life be ſo infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, the Colonel had done well to have ſpecifyed wherein. Almoſt the whole Life of that Lord, has been notoriouſly known to have been ſpent in that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Old Cauſe</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which the Colonel Religiouſly, even to his Death, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſerts, ſtyling himſelf no leſs than a <hi>Witneſs of God's Truth</hi>; and conſequently, arrogating a Crown of Martyrdom for dying in. Was not <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> all along this Lord's <hi>Gamaliel?</hi> And has he not lived a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually profeſt Enemy to theſe very Idols to whom this Gentleman ſays, <hi>he dy'd a Sacrifice.</hi> And if ſo, How can this Gentleman render his Accuſer's Life ſo Infamous, unleſs for thoſe very Principles, which he proudly boaſts are the glory of his own. Beſides, if his many Perjuries are ſo undeniable, he had done well to have given ſome Particulars of them. I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, the Violation of his Allegiance, in the days of the late Fanatical Rebellion, is none of the Perjuries he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to lay to his Charge; for then he muſt make that the Lord <hi>Howard</hi>'s Infamous <hi>Guilt,</hi> which he makes his own higheſt <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Honour.</hi> But if his Perjury con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in his late Diſcovery; from that the very dying Criminals; nay, ſome of them againſt their wills, have been his Compurgators. The very Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> in all his Proteſtations of Innocence in his laſt Speech con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes he had been at ſeveral Meetings where they had diſcours't of ſeizing the King's Guards; and though he endeavours to render it wholly a Diſcourſe by <hi>Accident,</hi> yet as accidental as 'twas, it brought the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> on purpoſe to <hi>Shepherd's</hi> to prevent the putting it in Execution, and perſwade ſome violent Men from <hi>attempting that which would undo them all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This indeed is the Lord <hi>Howards</hi> Perjury which the dying <hi>Sidney</hi> quarrels with: and to ſtigmatize him deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er yet, he very audaciouſly and Libellouſly affirms that the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> had not only <hi>Seen</hi> but <hi>CONFEST</hi> that <hi>the Crimes he had committed would not be pardoned but for committing of greater; and even the promiſed par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don not to be obtaind till the Drudgery of Swearing was over.</hi> 'Tis not enough, it ſeems, as he ſays afterwards, <hi>That the Bench was fill'd with thoſe that had been Blemiſhes to the Bar:</hi> And conſequently the <hi>Judges</hi> corrupted, and the Law perverted; yes and the Court, nay Government it ſelf rendred no leſs than Supporters of <hi>Popery,</hi> where he tells us <hi>He dyes a Sacrifice to Idols.</hi> But for the laſt moſt Diabolical Calumny from the blackeſt Spirit of Fanaticiſme, he inſolently accuſes the King himſelf of the moſt wretched <hi>Subornation</hi> of <hi>Perjury,</hi> as if the Lord <hi>Howards</hi> Pardon had been only obtained by the merit of Swearing <hi>Innocent Men</hi> out of their Lives.</p>
            <p>Good God! to what Outrages can that ſin of Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft <hi>Rebellion</hi> inchant her Proſelites! 'Tis well he ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies ſome part of our Aſtoniſhment, by owning as he lived ſo he died a Votary to the good <hi>Old Cauſe.</hi> And for the Credit of his 40 years Apprentiſſhip to it, he's grown ſo great a Maſter in the Craft of it, that I aſſure you, he has ſhot at one Bolt a Blacker Aſperſion againſt the Honor of the <hi>Son,</hi> then all the united Tongues and accumulated Forgeries of ſo many Years Triumphant Rebellion had Impudence to raiſe againſt his <hi>Father.</hi> But if it were true, that the Ld. <hi>Howard</hi> had really <hi>Confeſt</hi> that he could not obtain a pardon for his Crimes, but by committing more. Why did not this Guiltleſs, this Plotleſs Gentleman at his Tryal, lay hold of ſo lucky an Occaſion, as the ſubpaening thoſe People that <hi>heard</hi> him confeſs it, to averr the Truth of ſuch a <hi>Confeſſion,</hi> A Confeſſion, the Proof whereof would not only have been a Confutation of the Credit of his Accuſer, and conſequently the ſaving of his own Life; but likewiſe, an unanſwerable Confirmation of that Innocence, which, the whole party ſo indefatigably labour to uphold, and which, the dying L. <hi>Ruſſell</hi> ſo boldly aſſerted, though by equivocating even with Heaven it ſelf on the very Brink of Eternity, and adding at his laſt Gaſp Hipocriſy to Treaſon, a Crime as Capital at Gods Tribunal as the Other at Mans.</p>
            <p>Well, but what ſignifies that? This dying ſpeech was calculated for the underſtanding of the Rabble; and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or Truth is no part of the Fuell, where the Crowd is to be inflamed. Calumny ſticks with them, though never ſo forged, and Innocence (though but a meer ſound) is ſubſtantial in a <hi>True Proteſtant.</hi> The very Foundation of this Gentleman's <hi>Good Old Cauſe</hi> was all no more. The old Kings <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary Power</hi> were all rank Calumny and Lies, the Bugbears of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſtracted Years and the Incentives of the moſt Bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Civil War, and three flouriſhing Kingdoms Ruine was all but Sound and Noiſe. And if <hi>Sham</hi> and <hi>Impoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure</hi> was the great Buſineſs of the <hi>Good Old Cauſe</hi> in her Minority, and the <hi>Good Old Cauſe</hi> ex <hi>confeſſo</hi> has been this Gentlemans <hi>Saint</hi> from his Youth to his very Death, I cannot comprehend why ſhe ſhould be more modeſt or her Conſcience ſtraighter laced, in this preſent, 83, now ſhe has gotten almoſt half a Hundred Years upon her Back; and therefore this departing Gentleman, from the Standart he dies under, gives us very ſhrewd Suſpicions of the Integrity of his Aſſertions.</p>
            <p>But to return to the Paper. Why this Villanous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection againſt his Majeſty, for his Tardineſs in grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the L. <hi>Howard</hi> a Converted Fanaticks Pardon; when his truſting or forgiving thoſe ſly and not eaſily recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled Enemies is the greateſt Prudence of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which freſh Example of his Majeſties late too haſty Pardon ſufficiently teſtifies: when the Young <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalon</hi> in his late ſolemn and penitent Confeſſion of his Conſpiracy, with the humbleſt proſtration at the Feet of the King &amp; Duke, made only a Politick Incurſion into the Court for the Prize and Booty of a Pardon, whilſt the nobleſt Bounty and tendereſt Mercy from the beſt and moſt indulgent of Kings, was only returned with the pooreſt of Artifices, and baſeſt Ingratitude.</p>
            <p>From this he comes to debate upon the Papers <hi>ſaid,</hi> (as he calls it) <hi>to be found in his Cloſet by the King's Officers</hi>; and complains highly of the Injuſtice done; firſt, by laying the Guilt of a Paper to his Charge, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the <hi>Similitude of a hand which may be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit.</hi> But the main matter, (and indeed a very great part of the whole Sheet is upon this ſtring) is the vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating the Innocence of that Manuſcript: and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he ſets down the ſeveral Heads of the Diſcourſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it, as not at all guilty of the leaſt Treaſonable Poſition; but on the contray, in his own Opinion, the higheſt Arguments of Right-Reaſon: the whole Reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52203:3"/>
of which I ſhall not here trouble my ſelf with, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too immaterial here, as indeed they are all <hi>mal a propos,</hi> and impertinently urged there. For what ſignifies his recital of the heads of a Treatiſe, in defence of the Innocence of the whole Pamphlet, without mention of thoſe particular Paſſages which the Jury adjudged Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable. If, as by his own Confeſſion, thoſe Topicks the Book treats upon, were harmleſs; it does not at all follow, but dangerous and treaſonable Methods may be laid down in it; and that for the very obtaining even the faireſt and moſt plauſible Ends. I ſhall only repeat two Paragraphs of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the Right and Power of Magiſtrates in every Country was, That which the Laws of that Country, made it to be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the Laws were to be obſerved, and the Oaths taken by them, having the force of a Contract between Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate and People, could not be violated, without danger of diſſolving the whole Fabrick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, as blameleſs as this Diſcourſe in his Thoughts may be, what does he infer from the danger of, <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving the whole Fabrick,</hi> upon the ſupream Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates <hi>violating of his Oath,</hi> but a licence for the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to rebel, to cauſe this Diſſolution in revenge of that Violation. And then, if there can be that Pretence, whatever, to impower them to make ſuch a Diſſolution, it neceſſarily follows, thar the Soveraign Power is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to his Subjects for his Breach of Truſt, and conſequently the old <hi>High Court of Juſtice,</hi> or any other ſhorter cut to puniſh him, is the Right and Prerogative of the People. I ſhall not enlarge upon the Confutation of that damnable Principle, it being the ſubject of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Pens already, &amp; the very thought of it the abhorrence of every good Man and true Chriſtian. For though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly there is not, nor can be a higher Obligation, on a Prince than to Rule by the Laws and defend the Rights of his Subjects; yet upon the Breach of that Obligation, and the Invaſion of thoſe Rights, the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal of God is the only place, where he muſt anſwer for it. Beſides, if Monarchs were queſtionable, and conſequently puniſhable by the People, let them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce their Law for ſuch queſtioning, or ſuch a Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but if they can produce no ſuch Law, 'tis very hard, methinks, that thoſe violent <hi>Magna Charta</hi> Blades, and <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Property</hi> Men, that would rail downright at the whipping but of a Beggar, unleſs the Letter of the Law brings him to it, ſhould not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, be for Judging, Condemning, nay, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing a Monarch without it.</p>
            <p>But his greateſt Grievance, and that which he calls <hi>the higheſt Extravigancy of his Proſecutors,</hi> is, that the Contents of that Treatiſe ſhould be interpreted by them, <hi>as intended to stir up the People in Proſecution of the Deſigns of the Conſpiracy, when nothing of Particular application unto Time, Place, or Perſons could be found in it (as has ever been done by thoſe who endeavour to raiſe Inſurrections) all was ſupply'd by</hi> Innuendo's. <hi>Whatſoever is ſaid of the Expulſion of</hi> Tarquin: <hi>the Inſurrection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt</hi> Nero<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>the Slaughter of</hi> Caligula <hi>and</hi> Domitian, <hi>the tranſlation of the Crown of</hi> France <hi>from</hi> Meroveus <hi>to</hi> Pepin; <hi>and from his Deſcendants unto</hi> Hugh Capet, <hi>and the like is applyed by</hi> Innuendo <hi>unto the King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, why his Proſecutors ſhould be arraigned in this Caſe, I cannot underſtand; for if Treaſonable Tenents were to be ſpread about in Pamphlets, to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs the People with a hatred of Kings; they could have none but Fools or Madmen for their Authors, that would ſend 'um into the World bare-fac'd. The moſt hardy of all Conſpirators, thoſe that dayly truſted their Lives and Fortunes in the hands of truſty <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Will Bedlow</hi>'s in ſo many hundred Plot-letters, durſt hardly ever venture them abroad, without here and there a Cypher at leaſt, as 48 for the King, and Barley-broth for the Parliament. And why ſo great a Treatiſe as this, deſignd no doubt for Publication ſhould fooliſhly lay the ſcene at <hi>White-hall,</hi> and not more wiſely at <hi>Tarquin</hi>'s, or <hi>Nero</hi>'s Court, I cannot appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend. And if Treaſon under ſo tranſparent a Mask might walk abroad unqueſtioned, and the Authors un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſht, we might quickly ſee Volumes of it.</p>
            <p>But to ſumm all, he ſays, that he was long ſince told, that he muſt dye, or the Plott muſt dye.</p>
            <p>Now I ſuppoſe, none of his Proſecutors told him ſo; and if his own Party told him it, 'tis very idly brought in here, as an Aſſertion of no Plot.</p>
            <p>His following Objection againſt his Jury as being <hi>packt,</hi> is ſo unreaſonable, that 'tis not worth a repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, and the objected want of Free-holders for Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-men, a Conſtitution only intended to keep out Vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonds from Juries, is ſo idle in the Caſe of a <hi>London</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; where the richeſt and ſubſtantialeſt Citizens, nay, often the very <hi>Maior</hi> and <hi>Sheriffs</hi> under that want, would be uncapable of being Jurors, that nothing can be more His other pretended Injuſtice, in the denial of a Copy of his Inditement, or the reading the Statute, I leave to the wiſdom of the long Robe to decide.</p>
            <p>But to ſumm all: He ſays, <hi>By theſe means I was brought to this place. The Lord forgive thoſe Practiſes and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils that threaten the Nation from them. The Lord ſanct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ifie theſe my Sufferings unto me, and though I fall as a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to Idols, ſuffer not Idolatry to be Eſtablſht in the Land.</hi> Here the Lord <hi>Ruſſell</hi> is quite out-ſhot, for his Popery was but <hi>pouring in upon us,</hi> but here the Banks are broken, and 'tis already overflowing whilſt his being a <hi>ſacrifice to Idols,</hi> implies he falls by the hand of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſo the King Government and Judges, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e all the hands and limbs of the Beaſt already: only he prays it may never be <hi>Establiſht.</hi> And what's all this, but that the Whore of <hi>Babylon</hi> has invaded the Throne, and only wants the Ceremony of Inſtallment and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation, to confirm her Abſolute Dominion.</p>
            <p>Next he goes on. <hi>Bleſs thy People and ſave them, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend thy own cauſe, and thoſe that defend it. Stir up ſuch as are faint. Direct thoſe that are willing. Confirm thoſe that waver. Give wiſdom and Integrity to all. Order all things ſo as may moſt redound to thy own Glory, &amp;c.</hi> which a little more at length is, <hi>Bleſs thy People and ſave them, viz.</hi> Thy choſen People, that ſet up Order by Confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Religion by Schiſm, and Reformation by Deſolation. <hi>Defend the Cauſe</hi> of a Chriſtian Rebellion againſt an An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tichriſtian Monarchy. <hi>Stir up ſuch as are faint,</hi> and dare not hazard their Necks in ſo Illuſtrious a Cauſe. <hi>Direct thoſe that are willing</hi> to venture Souls and Bodies. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm thoſe that waver</hi> betwixt a ſcotch Covenant and an Engliſh Oath of Allegiance. <hi>Give wiſdome</hi> to all Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Counſels, and Integrity to all faithful Aſſociators, <hi>and order all things ſo as may redound most to thy own Glory,</hi> when we ſhall Bind their Kings in Chains and their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in Fetters of Iron. And that all this is the plain and Genuine ſenſe of his Prayer, the following Clauſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Diſcant or Addition will egregiouſly demonſtrate: for he concludes, <hi>Grant that I may dye glorifiing Thee
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52203:4"/>
for all thy Mercies, and that at the last, Thou hast per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted me to be ſingled out as a Witneſs of thy Truth; and even by the Confeſſion of my Oppoſers for that</hi> Old Cauſe <hi>in which I was from my Youth engaged, and for which Thou hast often and wonderfully declared thy ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For my part, I can no way match this dying Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, but in the Courage of ſome of the old King's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicides Executed at <hi>Charing Croſs,</hi> Here the <hi>Good Old Cauſe</hi> is expreſly aſſerted, even on the Scaffold, nay, and made no leſs than the very <hi>Shibboleth</hi> of GOD. The of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and wonderful Succeſſes of a once proſperous Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, and conſequently Blood and Sacriledge, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the <hi>Protestant-Church,</hi> and the ſolemn Murder of the beſt of Kings, made no leſs than the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous</hi> Work of the Almighty Hand, and the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing <hi>Declaration</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> it ſelf. Inſomuch, that there wanted only to this farewell Paper and the Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of Infatuations in this departing <hi>Enthuſiast</hi> to have made his <hi>Exit</hi> like a perfect ſecond <hi>Harriſon,</hi> to have had him bequeath'd the keeping of his <hi>Execution-Coat,</hi> as the other did his <hi>Velvet-Jump,</hi> for his own wearing again after his Third-days <hi>Reſurrection</hi> from the Grave.</p>
            <p>This unhappy Paper of his, has truely ſhow'd, he dies with the ſublimeſt Tranſports, and boldeſt Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a <hi>Pſeudo-Protestant Souldier:</hi> but alas! with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Conduct of a <hi>Machivilian.</hi> For this fooliſh piece of Scribble has quite deſtroyed the very Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the whole Party. With what a full-mouth'd Out-cry did the whole Brotherhood abhor, ſo much as the Imagination of a Common-wealth, or the leaſt Thought againſt <hi>Monarchy.</hi> How Capital was it, even during the Seſſions of three or four Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aments, to pretend the leaſt reſemblance or tendency of Eighty and Eighty One to Forty, and Forty one. Nay, did not the moſt violent of the <hi>Commons</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the very loudeſt Beagles of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> totally run down all the old Sham-pretences of <hi>Popery,</hi> and all Republick <hi>Machinations</hi> whatever. Yes, and did not the very City it ſelf in their memorable Petition to his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> in expreſs terms renounce and abjure all <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth Principles</hi>: and that very Abjuration uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally upheld all along to this day? But this unpoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Gentleman has very unfortunately pull'd off the whole Vizard: has joyn'd the pieces of the Snake to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether again, and made the preſent <hi>true Proteſtant</hi> Zeal, as a Branch of the <hi>Old Cauſe,</hi> no leſs than a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Link of the old Chain of Rebellion: nay, and not only avow'd it his <hi>own</hi> Tenent alone, but offer'd up his Prayers for the People, and the whole Faction un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all Claſſes, the <hi>Faint,</hi> the <hi>Willing,</hi> and the <hi>Waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>; and given them his own dying <hi>Benediction,</hi> no otherwiſe than as the Diſciples of the ſame <hi>Belial.</hi>
