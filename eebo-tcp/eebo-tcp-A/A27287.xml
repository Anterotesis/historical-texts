            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHich I think is more than any one has

               </gap>; but 'tis not to beg
your pardon for diverting you from your affairs, by
such an idle Pamphlet as this is, for I presume you
have not much to do, and therefore are to be obliged
to me for keeping you from worse imployment, and if
you have a better, you may get you gone about your
business: but if you will mispend your time, pray
lay the fault upon your self; for I have dealt pretty
fairly in the matter, and told you in the Title <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>age
what you are to expect within. Indeed, had I hung
out a sign of the Immortality of the Soul, of the Mystery
of Godliness, or of Ecclesiastical Policie, and then had
treated you with Indiscerpibility, and Essential Spissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
(words, which though <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

just nothing) with a company of Apocryphal midnight
tales cull'd out of the choicest insignificant Authors; If
I had only prov'd in Folio that <hi>Apollonius</hi> was a

three of the worst principles transcrib'd out of the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory

I were then indeed sufficiently in fault; but having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd

            <p>I would not yet be understood to lessen the dignity of
Playes, for surely they deserve a place among the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
if not the better sort of Books; for I have heard that
most of that which bears the name of Learning, and
which has abus'd such quantities of Ink and Paper, and
continually imploys so many ignorant, unhappy souls for
ten, twelve, twenty years in the Vniversity (who yet
poor wretches think they are doing something all the
while) as Logick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and several other things
(that shall be nameless, lest I should mispel them)
are much more absolutely nothing than the errantest
Play that e're was writ. Take notice, Reader, I do not
assert this purely upon my own knowledge; but I
think I have known it very fully prov'd, both sides
being fairly heard, and seen some ingenious opposers of
it most abominably baff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which I have got so perfectly by rote, that if this were
a proper place for it, I am apt to think my self could al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
make it clear; and as I would not undervalue
Poetry, so neither am I altogether of their judgement,
who believe no wisdom in the world beyond it. I
have often heard indeed (and read) how much the
World was anciently oblig'd to it for most of that
which they call'd Science, which my want of letters
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>akes me less assur'd of than others happily may be:


<pb facs="tcp:98391:3"/>
but I have heard some wise men say, that no considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
part of useful knowledge was this way commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated,
and on the other way, that it hath serv'd to
propagate so many idle superstitions, as all the benefits
it hath or can be guilty of, can never make sufficient
amends for, which unaided by the unluckey charms of
Poetry, could never have possest a thinking Creature
such as man. However true this is, I am my self well
able to affirm that none of all o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

And it was smartly said, (how prudently I cannot t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

because that miracle of Wit (in spight of Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demick

of our latter Plays have not done much more to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

any one can have to expect it from them: for, sure
I am, no Play was ever writ with that design. If you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
Tragedy, you'l find their best of characters unlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
patterns for a wise man to pursue: For he that is
the Knight of the Play, no sublunary feats must serve
his Dulcinea; for if he can't bestrid the Moon, he'l ne'er
make good his business to the end, and if he chance to


<pb facs="tcp:98391:4"/>
be offended, he must without considering right or wrong
confound all things he meets, and put you half a score
likely tall fellows into each pocket; and truly if he come
not something near this pitch, I think the Tragedies
not worth a farthing; for Playes were certainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
for the exercising of mens passions, not their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings,
and he is infinitely far from wise, that will
bestow one moments private meditation on such things:
And as for Comedie, the finest folks you meet with there,
are still unfitter for your imitation, for though with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

               </gap>mour, good Manners, and

discourse as formallie about the rules of it, as if 'twere

A thing, Reader—but no more of such a Smelt:
This thing, I tell ye, opening that which serves it for
a mouth, out issued such a noise as this to those that
sate about it, that they were to expect a woful Play,
God damn him, for it was a womans. Now how this
came about I am not sure, but I suppose he brought it
piping hot from some, who had with him the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a villanous Wit: for Creatures of his size of
sence talk without all imagination, such scraps as
they pick up from other folks. I would not for a
world be taken arguing with such a propertie as this,

parts, who could upon mature deliberation disting<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

before, that Plays have no great room for that which

for I am inform'd his Learning was but Grammer high;
(sufficient indeed to rob poor <hi>Salust</hi> of his best Orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons)

excellent Play of <hi>Harry</hi> the Fourth (which yet I hope
is far enough from Farce) hath very hardly kept his
Doublet whole; but affectation hath always had a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

truth and judgement have: and for our Modern ones,
except our most unimitable Laureat, I dare to say I

have a complaint or two to make to you, and I have
done; Know then this Play was hugely injur'd in the
Acting, for 'twas done so imperfectly as never any was
before, which did more harm to this than it could have
done to any of another sort; the Plot being busie (though
I think not intricate) and so requiring a continual at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
which being in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>errupted by the intolerable neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
of some that acted in it, must needs much spoil
the beauty on't. My Dutch Lover spoke but little of what
I intended for him, but supply'd it with a deal of idle
stuff, which I was wholly unacquainted with, till I had
heard it first from him; so that Iack pudding ever
us'd to do: which though I knew before, I gave him yet
the part, because I knew him so acceptable to most o'th'

               </gap> Yet, but Reader,

by a Person who had surely made it good, if any, but he

gayer cloathes, swears, drinks, and does every thing with
a better grace than he: Damns the stingy Cabal of the two

breaks the Glasses over his head, scorning to drink twice in

            <l>That damn'd their Playes which hang'd the German Princess:</l>
            <l>And we with ornament set off a Play</l>
