            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the Publication of this Book I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign for the Reader a double Benefit: 1. A uſeful and profitable Book: 2. A clear Proſpect into an Exemplary Life of a very eminent and famous Perſon. The Book, I may be bold to ſay, is of it ſelf ſuch; and yet I have good reaſon to hope that the great and known Worth of the Author (which yet this very Book will further diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and demonſtrate) and the Eſteem the World hath always had of him, will make it more ſuch. But leſt I ſhould prejudice both it and its Author by unſeaſonably raiſing the Reader's expectation, I muſt, to do Right and Juſtice to the Author, acquaint the Reader with ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, fit for his notice and conſideration con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Author's Intention, his manner of Writing it, and the Work it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:50435:3"/>And, 1. I may with much Confidence, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what I knew of the Author's mind and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign in general in all his Writings of this kind, and upon ſome Obſervations peculiar to this, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the Reader that it was not written with any <hi>Intention</hi> or thoughts that ever it ſhould be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed. He had undoubtedly no other aim or deſign in it, than what I have already mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Preface to the firſt Volume of his Contemplations. He was a man who had an extraordinary faculty of doing much in a little time: And yet did he as highly value, and was as great a <hi>Husband of his time,</hi> as any man I have known or read of. But of no part of his time was he more frugal, than of that which was ſet apart for Sacred Uſes, that none of that might be ſuffered to run waſte: eſpecially of the Chriſtian Sabbath or <hi>Lord's Day,</hi> he was moſt religiouſly obſervant, both in Publick and in Private, in his Family, and in his Study. And his religious Obſervation thereof, did not only procure to himſelf (as he always believed) a ſpecial Bleſſing upon his Employment of the reſt of his time in his other Studies, and Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar buſineſs, but hath moreover produced (which he little expected) what may prove of great uſe and benefit to many others. For that part of thoſe dayes which did intervene between Evening Sermon and Supper-time, he uſually im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in Pious Meditations: and having a very ready hand at writing, he uſually wrote his
<pb facs="tcp:50435:3"/>
thoughts, that he might the better hold them intent to what he was about, and keep them from wandring. This was his firſt and principal reaſon for it. He had indeed ſome thoughts of ſome other Uſes, that he or his might make there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: as, that afterward reviewing what he had written long before, he might ſee what Progreſs he had made in the mean time; and poſſibly they might be of ſome uſe or benefit to ſome of his Family: But what I firſt mentioned, was the firſt and principal occaſion and Motive to it. Of the ſhorter Diſcourſes, I found divers of the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals in the hands of his Children and Servants, and a great part of the reſt in a very neglected condition, till I perſwaded, and prevailed with him, to let them be collected and bound together in Volumes. But of theſe, among which this was one, I am well ſatisfied, there were none which he intended when he wrote them ſhould ever be Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, though he hath ſince wrote others which he intended for the Publick. But upon this occaſion hath he written firſt and laſt many pious and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Diſcourſes, which, whether intended by him for the Preſs or not, I am of opinion may do much good in the World, if they were printed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. His uſual <hi>Manner of writing</hi> theſe things was this: When he had reſolved on the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, the firſt thing He uſually did, was with his pen upon ſome looſe piece of paper, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times upon a corner or the margin of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per he wrote on, to draw a Scheme of his whole
<pb facs="tcp:50435:4"/>
Diſcourſe, or of ſo much of it as he deſigned at that time to conſider. This done he tap'd his thoughts and let them run, as he expreſſed it to me himſelf; and they uſually ran as faſt as his hand (though a very ready one) could trace them; inſomuch that in that ſpace, as he hath told me, he often wrote two ſheets, and at other times between one and two; and I have my ſelf known him write according to that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, when I have been reading in the ſame room with him, for divers hours together. So that theſe writings are plainly a kind of <hi>extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore</hi> Meditations, only they came from a Head and Heart well fraught with a rich Treaſure of Humane and Divine Knowledge, which the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Legiſlator <hi>Juſtinian</hi> makes the neceſſary qualifications of a compleat Lawyer. And here it is farther to be obſerved, that all his larger Tracts, ſuch as this, which could not be finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at one time, were written upon <hi>great inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals of time,</hi> and ſuch wherein much buſineſs of a quite different Nature had interpoſed, which uſually interrupt the thread of a Mans thoughts.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Concerning <hi>the Book</hi> it ſelf, the Reader may of himſelf perceive that it was not finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but that he had deſigned to have continued it farther. He hath written a particular Tract <hi>Of doing as we would be done to,</hi> which is the Subject at which this is left off. But that, as I take it, was written long ſince this, and not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for any Continuation of it: but it had
<pb facs="tcp:50435:4"/>
been very proper to have been joyned with it, had I had any Tranſcript of it.</p>
                  <p>Upon peruſal of the Manuſcript of his own hand-writing, it may be further obſerved; 1. That it was the Original draught, and no Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript; for therein, as I remember, may in ſome places be ſeen, ſome of thoſe very Schemes which he firſt drew, when he began to write. 2. That he had not ſo much as reviſed any part of it, it being for the moſt part as fair, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Alteration as if it were a Tranſcript. 3. The Original is one continued Diſcourſe, without any Diſtinction of Parts or Chapters, or ſo much as any Title ſuperſcribed: But I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it a very methodical Diſcourſe, and ſuch as may very aptly be diſtinguiſhed into thoſe Parts and Chapters, and under thoſe Titles which I have aſſigned, as it now appears in the Print. And this is a further evidence, that he did not deſign it for the Preſs.</p>
                  <p>Of the <hi>two Parts</hi> of it, the firſt is wholly Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtical and Metaphyſical, and therefore ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what above the Capacity of ordinary Readers; but it is but ſhort: but the other is for the moſt part plain and eaſie, ſuch as may be of great uſe to the meaneſt Capacities, and yet full of matter worthy the Contemplation of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt. But of the whole I muſt farther obſerve, that it was a work of his younger years; that he afterward much improved his Metaphyſical and Scholaſtical Obſervations and Diſcourſes.
<pb facs="tcp:50435:5"/>
and ſomewhat altered his opinion touching ſome Points in Controverſie, eſpecially between the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrants and Contra-Remonſtrants. But as in what is Scholaſtical, there is nothing but what is agreeable to the Sentiments of the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Writers in that kind of Learning; ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the reſt, is there any thing diſputable, but what is maintain'd by eminent Men of the Church of <hi>England</hi> as the Doctrine of this Church: And ſince his opinion neither firſt nor laſt was other than what hath been, and is at this day aſſerted to be the Doctrine of this Church, or at leaſt within the bounds of what is ſo aſſerted, (For he was always very moderate in theſe things.) I conceive I need not trouble the Reader or my ſelf farther about it.</p>
                  <p>And now if theſe things only, which I have hitherto mention'd, be duly conſidered, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive they will afford ſo juſt <hi>Excuſe</hi> and full <hi>Vindication</hi> of the Author againſt all Cenſures, Cavils and Exceptions to any thing in this Work, that I think they are not to be feared from any, but ſuch as have little ingenuity or ſenſe of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity. And the Cenſures and Cavils of ſuch, I am of opinion, ought to be contemned. And for my own part, I hope I ſhall never be affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from any good and juſtifiable work, by any ſuch Bug-bears.</p>
                  <p>But I intend not only to do <hi>Right,</hi> but to do <hi>Honour,</hi> and yet no more than is juſtly due, in what I do, to our excellent Author. And to this
<pb facs="tcp:50435:5"/>
end, I muſt take notice of <hi>the Time,</hi> when this was written. And that was about the ſame time, when he began his Practice at the Law. He had at that time gone through, and made himſelf Maſter of a long and intricate Study, of a quite different nature from this; had read and abridged all the Old, and all the New Law then extant, in two Volumes in Folio ſtill to be ſeen, had read over a great part of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, as may be ſeen in his marginal Notes and References in divers of his Books, and in the Tranſcripts of much of thom now in the Library of <hi>Lincoln</hi>'s <hi>Inn;</hi> (for he ſpared nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pains nor charge in thoſe things before ever he began to practiſe;) had looked into the Civil and Canon Laws, ſo far as they are in uſe with us, or were ſubſervient to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Knowledge of our Laws; in ſhort, had read what ever either of Law, Hiſtory or other Books, in Print or Manuſcript he thought could any way conduce to compleat his Knowledge and Skill in his Profeſſion of the Law. And for a Man thus induſtriouſly imployed in ſuch Studies, and yet to have made ſuch a Progreſs in Philoſophy and Divinity, as appears by this Book, nay and to write ſuch a Book under ſuch Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, as I have mentioned before, and at ſuch an Age, <hi>viz.</hi> about thirty, or one and thirty, having been till then ſo buſie in other Studies, muſt needs, I am perſwaded, in the judgment of all candid per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, raiſe him and his Book not only above all
<pb facs="tcp:50435:6"/>
need of other Excuſe, but to a high degree of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration.</p>
                  <p>The truth is, what he performed in his Studies, is almoſt as incredible, as it is moſt certain and true. But as he was admirably qualified by Nature for Studies, ſo I doubt not but he had an <hi>extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Bleſſing attending his Labours</hi> therein. For if this be reaſonable to be believed of any, then certainly muſt I believe it of him upon divers Conſiderations: as, 1. His great Piety and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, and frequent application to Almighty God in the midſt of his ſecular Imployments; 2. His religious obſervance and imployment of times ſet apart for ſacred uſes; And 3. His con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious application to, and uſe of his Civil Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. Of all which in him, I think, I have as certain knowledge both by my Converſation and diſcourſe of matters of Religion with him, by peruſal of his Writings of all ſorts, and by obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his Actions, as ordinarily any Man can have of another.</p>
                  <p>And therefore though the Repreſentation of his great Induſtry, Learning, and Abilities be much for his Honour, yet is it <hi>a greater Honour</hi> than all this, which I intend to his Memory in the publication of this Book. And that is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate from thence the true Principles of all his Worth, and of thoſe great and generous Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which have made him ſo famous in his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, and like to be ſo in future Ages; and
<pb facs="tcp:50435:6"/>
thereby give the Reader the cleareſt &amp; trueſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect into the whole courſe of his Life. Had he not been very cordially and deeply affected with theſe things, it is no way credible, that a Man ſo very intent upon other Studies of ſo different a nature, for the ſix days together, could upon the ſeventh ſo intirely have withdrawn his Mind from them, as to apply it ſo cloſely to theſe. And this being written at his very entrance upon his Practice, and his Actions ever ſince being ſo reducible to the Principles diſcovered in this, nothing could give a more true and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory Proſpect into the Fundamentals of the future part of his Life, and conſequent Actions.</p>
                  <p>He was indeed the moſt <hi>Heavenly-minded</hi> Man I have ever known. He had had a Religious Education from his Childhood; and he very early made his Religion, the Religion of his Judgment and Choice, not of his Education only. He read the S. Scriptures to know it; then ſtudied the Works of Creation, Providence, and the Moral Evidences of the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, to know the Truth of it. And having laid ſo deep a Foundation, he ever after built firmly upon it: and by his faithful obſervance of it, arrived to that full Satisfaction and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it, which our Saviour mentions, <hi>John</hi> 7.17. He began theſe Studies very early; how early I do not preciſely know: but this I know from his own mouth, that he was very buſie in them while he ſtudied at <hi>Oxford:</hi> For when I firſt
<pb facs="tcp:50435:7"/>
peruſed part of this Book, I told him, I percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, he had before he wrote it, been acquainted with the Schoolmen: and conſidering when it was written, and how hard a Student he had been in the Law till that time, deſired to know when he could have had leiſure for thoſe Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies? and what Authors he read? He told me, At <hi>Oxford;</hi> and that he there read <hi>Aquinas, Scotus, Suarez,</hi> and others, whom he particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly named; but theſe I remember.</p>
                  <p>And here by the way, we may take notice, how much he is <hi>miſrepreſented</hi> and injured in that Story, printed in the Relation, which very unadviſedly and improperly bears the name of his Life, concerning his neglect of <hi>his Studies at Oxford.</hi> The truth of which, to do him right, is this,: His natural Genius inclined much to things of Wit and Gallantry, and the Players coming to the Act at <hi>Oxford</hi> while he was a Student there, he began at firſt to be taken with the Plays; but having before, among other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Obſervations, habituated himſelf to keep a ſtrict Watch over his Heart and Actions, he quickly reflected upon it: and therefore the more he perceived himſelf affected with it, the more reſolved he was to correct it; and left it ſhould in time prevail, ſo as to divert him from more ſerious Studies, or at leaſt, rob him of too much time, he made a ſolemn Vow, or Reſolution, which he ever after obſerved, never to ſee Play more; and ſo returned to his Studies again be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:50435:7"/>
the Players went out of Town. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, he was as hard a Student there, as he was afterward at <hi>London;</hi> though he held Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance and ſome kind of Converſe with the moſt ingenious Perſons at both places. But ſo much for that.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Studies, which he began ſo early, he continued to the very laſt, ſo long as he was able to write, within about a fortnight or three weeks before he died. And here he did, as he did in the Law, ſpared neither Pains nor Coſt upon any thing any way conducing to his main Deſign, tending to diſcover and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt the admirable Providence of God, whether in the Compoſure, Powers and Courſe of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or in the Government of the Actions of Men; inſomuch, that if a true Computation was made, I am perſwaded, that, as much time as he ſpent, and pains as he took in the Study and Practice of the Law, and Buſineſs of a not ordinary Judge, but Chief Baron and Chief Juſtice; yet the Time he imployed, and the Pains he took (if I may call that Pains, which afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo much Pleaſure and Satisfaction to him) in theſe Studies, and for that purpoſe, would be found to exceed them. The Benefit whereof, I hope the World may receive ſome time or other: but the Effect thereof upon himſelf was, that his ſo much contemplating the Wiſdom, Power, and Goodneſs of God, diſcernable in his Creatures, and obſervable in the Providential
<pb facs="tcp:50435:8"/>
Government of Men, eſpecially that admirable Myſtery of our Redemption, imprinted in his Soul a moſt inlarged apprehenſion and deep ſenſe of the Glorious Excellence and Majeſty of God, and his unconceivable Goodneſs to all who duly apply themſelves to him. This filled him with a moſt awful Reverence and devout Affection to him continually: which further produced great Conſtancy, Faithfulneſs, and Readineſs in his Obedience and Service, and converted his very Civil Imployments into a kind of continual Courſe of Religion; ſo that that laborious Life of his, was in a manner intirely ſacrificed to, and continually imployed in, or in order to, the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God. And all this, with thoſe divine benign Influences, which are never wanting to Souls thus diſpoſed, filled him with an humble Confidence, and made it, as it were, natural to him, to retire into himſelf with ſecret applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to God upon all occaſions in the very midſt of his Buſineſs. And certainly this Life was Heavenly and Holy, and yet not more Holy than Happy.</p>
                  <p>All this is very true: but he had very early taken up a Reſolution to abſtain from a high Profeſſion of Religion ('tis his own expreſſion) and he was ſo wary and cautious in it, that very little of what I have ſaid, was perceived by any of his moſt intimate Friends, but my ſelf. Inſomuch, that one of them, whom I know he much valued, and who had frequent
<pb facs="tcp:50435:8"/>
converſe with him, hath divers times ſince con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to me, how much he was miſtaken in him in that reſpect, before he ſaw his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations in Print. And I ſhould almoſt doubt of finding Credit in what I know to be true, with thoſe who do not know me, had I not pretty good Atteſtations from this, and a conſtant Courſe of moſt pious Meditations committed to writing under his own hand. Were we now to take a <hi>View of his whole Life,</hi> we might conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it as acted either in private, or in publick. His Actions in publick were viſible to the World, and yet it may be feared, that much of the remarkable particulars thereof will be loſt for want of competent Obſervers and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators. The private part of it was moſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in Retirement and Studies, and of this the greateſt part in Pious Meditations, the Contemplation of God, of his Works of Creation and Providence, the great and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Myſtery of our Redemption, and the Sacred Scriptures, and the Evidences of the Truth thereof. And as this did influence all his Actions in publick, ſo being once well underſtood, it muſt needs give the cleareſt Proſpect into the true and genuine Principles and Tendency of them, which is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal thing to be conſidered in them. And this can never better be made appear than by his own Writings, if they were publiſhed, as I conceive they ought to be.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:50435:9"/>* Having done this Right to the Author, I thought it but reaſonable to do ſome Right to my ſelf, and to the World; to ſhew, <hi>by what Right I have publiſhed this, and what Right the World hath to expect the reſt of his Writings.</hi> To which Purpoſe I had written another Sheet, to ſhew that the Author had, upon new Motives and Conſideration of Occurrences af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, changed his Mind before declared in his Will, wherein he had prohibited the print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any of his Writings after his Death. But upon further Conſideration, I think it may be ſufficient for this place to let the Reader know in general that he had done ſo, and to reſerve the more particular Diſcourſe of that, if there be occaſion for it, to my Memorials of him: And therefore I have ſuffer'd but few Copies of that Sheet to be printed off, for the Conſideration of ſuch, as it may moſt concern.</p>
                  <p>Of the Two little <hi>Diſcourſes annexed,</hi> I have only this to ſay, That the Firſt was one of his Later Writings, and perhaps, may a little vary from ſome of his Former: and that the Latter was more ancient. But neither of them was fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, though the Printer, according to the uſual Mode, hath put a <hi>Finis</hi> to them both: But otherwiſe, I hope, he hath acquitted himſelf reaſonably well; For I was at too great a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to peruſe the Sheets as they were print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed off. The Copies he had, were carefully
<pb facs="tcp:50435:9"/>
examined by the Originals: and I thought it moſt ſuitable to my Deſign, to let them be printed as near as might be, according to them, without any Alteration; preſuming upon the Candor of the ingenuous Reader, upon due Conſideration of the Circumſtances before mentioned.</p>

                        <p n="1">I. ALL things but the Soul it ſelf are extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecal to the Soul: and therefore of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity the Knowledge of all other things is extrinſecal to the Soul: for <hi>Knowledge</hi> is nothing elſe but the true impreſſion and ſhape of the thing known in the Underſtanding, or a concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on conform to the thing conceived. And although the Soul in its own nature be <hi>apta nata</hi> to receive ſuch impreſſions, and doth therefore naturally deſire and affect it; yet it is as impoſſible for the Soul to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50435:21"/>
know till the Object be ſome way applied to it, as for a Looking-glaſs to reflect without firſt uniting of a Species of ſome Body to it, that may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Means</hi> whereby the <hi>Scibile,</hi> or thing to be known, is united to the Soul, and conſequently Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is wrought, is <hi>threefold,</hi> viz.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Supernatural.</hi> Thus Almighty God, in the firſt Creation of Man, did faſten certain Principles of Truth in Man by his immediate diſcovery, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the Knowledge of Himſelf and his Will, which was properly the Image or Impreſſion of God in his Underſtanding. This was not eſſential to the Soul, but a Habit or Quality, which God put into his Underſtanding; and therefore though his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge decayed by his Fall, yet his Soul continued the ſame.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Artificial.</hi> Thus Knowledge is derived from Man to Man, by ſigns of thoſe impreſſions of Truth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that are wrought in his Underſtanding, that communicates it. Thus Knowledge is acquired by Writing, Speech, and other Signs, that are agreed upon to communicate Intelligence from the underſtanding of one Man to the underſtanding of another, though <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diante ſenſu.</hi> Thus the Reliques of the knowledge of God in <hi>Adam</hi> were derived to his Poſterity, though ſtill it grew for the moſt part of Men weaker and corrupter.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>Natural.</hi> And this may be divided into theſe <hi>three branches,</hi> viz.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Simple Apprehenſion.</hi> Thus when any object ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the Ear, or Eye, or other Senſe, is let into the Phantaſy, and ſo ſhewn to the Underſtanding with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either affirming or denying any thing concerning it.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Complex Apprehenſions,</hi> whereby either <hi>duo ſcibilia</hi> are joyned together in an Affirmation or Negation: and this is a <hi>Propoſition,</hi> which again is of two kinds,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50435:21"/>
                           <hi>viz.</hi> either that which is moſt univerſal, and therefore the firſt propoſition that is framed in the underſtanding, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is, or <hi>eſt,</hi> or <hi>eſt ens.</hi> For that notion doth neceſſarily and upon the firſt view of any object joyn it ſelf with it in the underſtanding. Other propoſitions are more complex or remote, as that God is good, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For the firſt queſtion, in the Underſtanding, is, Whether it be, to which that general propoſition anſwers; and in the next place, What it is, to which the ſecond ſort of complex notions anſwer. Now of this ſecond kind of complex notions there are two kinds, <hi>viz.</hi> either ſuch as without the help of any Diſcourſe or Ratioci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation preſent themſelves from the object to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; as this, The Man is red; the Man and the red, being both objects of Senſe, and meeting in the ſame ſubject: or elſe ſuch as either the thing affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or the thing whereof the affirmation is, or both, are things that do not immediately fall within our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as the Man is a ſubſtance, or, the Spirit is a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. Theſe though originally derived from ſenſe, yet they are refined by the help of Diſcourſe.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>Concluſions</hi> drawn either from theſe ſimple or complex apprehenſions, which flow into our underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding immediately by our Senſes: and this is <hi>Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Diſcourſe,</hi> a Faculty or Power put into Man, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he is beyond all other viſible Creatures; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by all his actions, whether Civil or Religious, are and ought to be guided. This is that Power, whereby we may improve even ſenſible Objects, Apprehenſions, and Obſervations; to attain more ſublime and high diſcoveries, and riſe from Effects to their Cauſes, till at laſt we attain to the <hi>Firſt Cauſe</hi> of all things.</p>
                        <p>So we may conclude that the Knowledge of our Creator, though it fall not within the reach of our Senſe, and ſo falls not immediately within the reach of our Underſtanding, yet by the aſcents and ſteps
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50435:22"/>
of Rational Diſcourſe, ſo much may be gathered, as may leave an Atheiſt without excuſe, God having given to Man, even in his lapſed condition, beſides other Providential helps, a ſtock of Viſibles, and a Rational Faculty to improve that ſtock to ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Knowledge of himſelf: <hi>For the inviſible things of him from the Creation of the World are clearly ſeen, being underſtood by the things that are made, even his Eternal Power, and Godhead, ſo that they are without excuſe,</hi> Rom, 1.20. Therefore, as on the one ſide we are to avoid curioſity in meaſuring the infinite Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Truth by our own finite Underſtandings; ſo on the other ſide we muſt beware of Supineneſs, and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of imploying that treaſure of God's Works, and his Light or Reaſon in us, to that end for which it was principally intruſted with us, even the knowledge of our Creator; yet ſtill humbly concluding with <hi>Elihu,</hi> Job 34.32. <hi>That which I ſee not, teach thou me.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">II. The firſt and moſt Magiſterial Truth in the World, upon which all other truths do depend, is this, <hi>That there is a Firſt Being and Cauſe of all other Beings.</hi> This is evident by clear Reaſon.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Either we muſt admit a Firſt Cauſe, or elſe an actual infiniteneſs of <hi>Succeſſion of Cauſes.</hi> The latter is impoſſible <hi>in Nature;</hi> becauſe it is impoſſible there can be that which is infinite and yet ſucceſſive; for then it would follow, That that which is actually infinite in number ſhould be yet more infinite, becauſe there are new Succeſſions on Cauſes and Cauſations</p>
                        <p>Again, it is impoſſible that there ſhould be an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal dependance of Cauſes one upon another without a Firſt, becauſe then the whole Collection of thoſe Cauſes taken all together muſt needs likewiſe be actually depending; and if ſo, then upon themſelves; and that is impoſſible, for the immediate Cauſe of the Effect doth not depend upon its Effect, but immediately upon
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50435:22"/>
its Cauſe. Therefore this bundle of dependent cauſes muſt depend upon ſome one among them, which is independent.</p>
                        <p>And impoſſible likewiſe <hi>in Experience.</hi> Take but the inſtance of one Creature, <note n="*" place="margin">Of this the Author hath written more largely in his <hi>Origination of Mankind.</hi>
                           </note> Man: It is plain that the World doth every day grow ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler and fuller: that, which is now almoſt a Nation, we can with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle help derive into one Man five hundred years ſince, ſo that it is not imaginable but that at length we muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily come to a Firſt Man: If ſo, how had that Man his being? It is true that there be ſome living creatures, that we may trace their beginning to the corruption of ſome preexiſting matter, which by its own temper and the concurrence of other ſecond cauſes, may produce a living creature, as Worms, Mice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But if there ſhould be ſuch a production of Man at firſt, why is it not ſo at ſome time ſince, <hi>viz.</hi> that a Man ſhould be produced out of the ground by ſome concurrence of the diſpoſition of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with ſecond cauſes? If it be ſaid that that is now needleſs, and Nature doth nothing in vain; the anſwer is unſatisfactory: For, 1. where ſuch productions are, as of Mice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it is as needleſs, becauſe they propagate their kind as well as Man. And 2. if Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth nothing in vain, it is plain that whatever is ſo called Nature, is in truth the firſt cauſe, though miſcalled Nature; for not to do any thing in vain, is an act of a Voluntary and Rational Agent; a mere natural Agent cannot but work uniformly, whether in vain or not in vain, when the matter is uniformly diſpoſed. Therefore we muſt needs have recourſe to a Firſt, Voluntary, and Intellectual Agent, that did at firſt make Man; and by his free Power did advance the piece of red Earth above its own diſpoſition, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50435:23"/>
beyond the cauſality of ſecond Cauſes, to produce Man; and that hath not ſince done the like: but as to thoſe other imperfect creatures hath planted in ſecond Cauſes ſuch a ſtrength and cauſality as out of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared matter to produce other living creatures without any concurrence of his immediate or extraordinary Power.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. In every <hi>Succeſſive Motion</hi> it is neceſſary to arrive to ſome beginning of it, and it is impoſſible it ſhould be eternal; as in caſe of the motion of the Sun, which is ſucceſſive; it cannot in reaſon be but there muſt be a time or inſtant, wherein it either was not, or did not move; for otherwiſe the revolutions would be actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly infinite in number, and yet that infinite number of revolutions be ſtill augmented by dayly new revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which would be in it ſelf a contradiction, that that which was before actually infinite, ſhould yet receive an increaſe, as neceſſarily it muſt if the motion of the Sun had never a beginning: Therefore of neceſſity it had a beginning. If it had a beginning of its moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it could not have it from it ſelf; for why did it not then move ſooner? But of neceſſity it muſt have the beginning from another; for though animate creatures move themſelves, yet they receive ſtill the original cauſe of their motion from ſomething with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them, as well as of their being. Who, or what, was it that gave it that motion, or principle of its motion? And if any could aſſign any other than the Firſt Cauſe (which is not almoſt imaginable) yet ſtill my enquiry muſt riſe higher, what was that that gave being or cauſality to that cauſe? So that in ſumm the motion of the Sun or Heavens cannot be Eternal, becauſe Succeſſive: It muſt have a Cauſe of its motion from without it ſelf; that Cauſe, if the Firſt Cauſe, then a Firſt Cauſe muſt be granted; if not the Firſt, yet by the ſame reaſon, that in all
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50435:23"/>
Succeſſive motions we muſt admit a beginning, we may conclude in all Succeſſions of Cauſes there muſt be a beginning, becauſe the being and cauſation or motion of ſecond cauſes is likewiſe Succeſſive, and therefore can be no more infinite than the ſucceſſive motions of the ſame ſubject can be infinite. It is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that any thing ſhould be Eternal that is not Indiviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>ut videbitur infra.</hi> So that the Succeſſion of Cauſes and Motion is that which doth neceſſarily inforce a firſt cauſe.</p>
                        <p>To theſe we (may) add thoſe <note n="*" place="margin">All which, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers others, the Author hath largely proſecuted in another Work in the 6. firſt Parts.</note> Conſiderations which ariſe from the Obſervation of the created World, the ſubſervience of one thing to the perſervation of another, the inclinations of Creatures without choice to means conducible to their preſervation, the ordering and fitting of things whereby confuſion and uſeleſneſs of creatures is avoided; all which do beſpeak the admiſſion of a Voluntary, Intellectual, Supreme, and Univerſal Cauſe of all things.</p>
                        <p>Now a Firſt Cauſe being admitted, we are to conſider what may rationally be deduced from thence <hi>concerning this Firſt Cauſe.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">This he hath likewiſe more largely handled in the <hi>7.</hi> Part of the ſame Work.</note> And thoſe are of two kinds: Firſt, ſuch as abſolutely concern his own Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Secondly, ſuch as concern him in relation to thoſe Effects, which proceed from him.</p>
                        <p>For the former of theſe we ſay, That a Firſt Cauſe of all things being granted,</p>
                        <p n="1">I. It neceſſarily follows that he hath no bounds of his exiſtence or being. The bounds of Exiſtence are either in Duration or Extenſion: the excluſion of the bounds of Exiſtence in Duration is Eternity; that in Extenſion is Immenſity.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="8" facs="tcp:50435:24"/>Now firſt for <hi>Eternity.</hi> Whatſoever is Eternal muſt be without Beginning, without Succeſſion, without End.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Without Beginning:</hi> For if it be a Firſt Cauſe, it cannot have a Beginning; for then he muſt have a Cauſe of his Being, which would be a contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Neither could he have a beginning from himſelf; for that were to ſuppoſe a pre-exiſtence in himſelf to himſelf, which were alſo repugnant.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Without Succeſſion:</hi> There is nothing paſt, nothing to come, for all is one indiviſible Succeſſion, and thoſe notions of Time, paſt, preſent, and to come, are only the conſequences of a Succeſſive Motion: for <hi>Time</hi> is nothing elſe but that conception whereby we meaſure ſucceſſive motion: were there no ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive motion in the World, it would be impoſſible that there ſhould be any of thoſe affections of Time; and conſequently, Time is not any thing real, but a relation to Motion. Now before that the Firſt Cauſe did ſet a continued motion in the World, there could be no Succeſſion, but all was wrapped up in one permanent inſtant: for the Being of the Firſt Cauſe, and his Motion, what ever it was, or is, is indiviſible, as ſhall be ſhewn. Then when he produced ſecond Cauſes, and conſequently thoſe moved in their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral cauſalities and courſes, and conſequently their moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, beings, and cauſalities being ſucceſſive, there was a <hi>prius,</hi> and <hi>poſterius,</hi> and ſucceſſion; yet this did not alter the indiviſible nature of that duration, which that indiviſible being had before, and at, and with that motion, which he after produced. The Firſt Being hath a co-exiſtence with the Succeſſive Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the creatures, but his duration is not meaſured by it, or co-extended with it, but is of the ſame indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſibility as if there had been no ſucceſſive motion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, and conſequently no ſucceſſive time.</p>
                        <p n="3">
                           <pb n="9" facs="tcp:50435:24"/>3. <hi>Without End:</hi> For firſt, what ſhould or can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine his being, in as much as all things elſe are his productions, and cannot have any cauſality up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him? Secondly, End is inconſiſtent with <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;</hi> for that is a permanent and fixed indiviſible, and takes in all paſt, preſent and to come, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any difference of notion. The preſent ſubſiſtence of the Firſt Cauſe was the ſame numerical in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant that he had a thouſand years ſince. So that End, as well as Succeſſion, is but of thoſe things that are meaſured by time, not of an indiviſible being: To ſuppoſe him to have an end were to ſuppoſe him not ever to have been; becauſe paſt, and preſent, and to come are all indiviſibly conjoyned in his duration.</p>
                        <p>This indiviſibility of duration is proper only to the Firſt Cauſe; for nothing elſe can upon any ſound ground be ſaid to be of indiviſible duration, though it may be of a perpetual. Suppoſe we the Being of an Angel, or the Soul, though admitted to be Everlaſting, yet that is rather a multiplyed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion of duration than any indiviſible duration: for of the Firſt Cauſe I may ſay truly, the inſtant of the duration, that is now, and that was a thouſand years ſince, or a thouſand years after, is the ſame: but I do not think the ſame may be affirmed of any other thing whatſoever: 1. becauſe their eſſence is not indiviſible and ſimple, as is that of the Firſt Cauſe; for it is evident they are perfectible, compounded of Act and Power, not pure Acts: 2. becauſe ſome things might be affirmed of them in a time paſt, which cannot now be affirmed of them; as the creation, continuance in the Body, ſeparation, re-union, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. their being is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent.</p>
                        <p n="2">
                           <pb n="10" facs="tcp:50435:25"/>II. From this admiſſion of a Firſt Cauſe doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily follow <hi>Immenſity,</hi> which includes three things.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Exemption</hi> from <hi>Circumſcription</hi> or bounds of his being. There is a twofold exemption from Circumſcription: 1. That which ariſeth from the diſproportion between the thing that ſhould cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcribe, and be circumſcribed: thus a Spirit of what kind ſoever is not circumſcribed, nor is in any determinate place, for that is proper to a Body, that hath extenſion of parts; yet though we cannot ſay, It is here, yet we are ſure we cannot ſay, It is every where. There is 2. another exemption from circumſcription, which ariſeth from Infinitude, that it exceeds all place and circumſcription: Now that it is thus with the Firſt Cauſe is evident; for if he had a Being before any thing elſe, nothing then could bound his Being; if it ſhould, then he could not be the Firſt Cauſe, there being ſomething elſe that had limited him, which had a pre-exiſtence to his cauſation: and it is impoſſible for any thing to have a limited or bounded Being, unleſs it were ſo limited or bounded by ſomething without it. That which is without a cauſe of his being, muſt needs be without bounds of his being: Neither could thoſe effects, which he after produced, ſtraiten the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, as I may call it, of his Being, or ſhut him out from them. From whence follows</p>
                        <p n="2">2. His <hi>Omnipreſence,</hi> not only vertually and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentially, but eſſentially in and with all things, though the manner of it be incomprehenſible, becauſe a conſequence of his Infinitude. This is <hi>Exemption from Excluſion;</hi> for it is not poſſibly imaginable, that the production of new Effects ſhould exclude or ſtraiten that indiviſible extent, which that being had before thoſe Effects were produced.</p>
                        <p n="3">
                           <pb n="11" facs="tcp:50435:25"/>3. <hi>Exemption from Succeſſion or Diviſion of Parts;</hi> for otherwiſe he could not be Immenſe; for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever hath Succeſſion of Parts, as his Parts are mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurable, ſo is the whole, and therefore cannot be actually Infinite in Extenſion, as I may call it. And this doth conſequently exempt him <hi>from Materiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> Succeſſion of Parts being an affection of a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial ſubſtance, and therefore it is an indiviſible Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſity. What is ſaid of the Soul may explain it, <hi>Tota in toto, &amp; tota in qualibet parte.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">III. Hence it follows, that the Firſt Cauſe is <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſible,</hi> and that in a double oppoſition.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. In Oppoſition to Diviſibility, which is partly touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before; and though this be common to all things that are incorporeal, for Diviſibility is an effect of Quantity, yet it is moſt eminently to be affirmed of the Firſt Cauſe.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. In Oppoſition to Multiplicity; and this is the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of the Firſt Cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that there is but one Firſt Cauſe of all things; for if there were two, or more Firſt Cauſes, either all muſt be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite in Being, and conſequently in Operation, and that is impoſſible, <hi>viz.</hi> that there ſhould be two Infinites, becauſe one muſt of neceſſity bound and limit the other, both in Being, and Power: 2. or elſe both muſt be finite, and then of neceſſity each muſt have a Cauſe of his Being; for what is it that ſhould preſcribe the bounds to theſe Beings, unleſs the Cauſe of their Beings? if ſo, they can neither be the Firſt Cauſe: or 3. one muſt needs be Infinite, and the other Finite and Subordinate; and then of neceſſity, thoſe Finite Beings cannot be the Firſt Cauſes, but meerly Second Cauſes, depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon that Infinite Being, both in their Eſſence, and Operation; for nothing can have limits of his being, but what hath cauſes of his being, which ſhould preſcribe thoſe limits.</p>
                        <p n="4">
                           <pb n="12" facs="tcp:50435:26"/>IV. From hence likewiſe follows, that the Firſt Cauſe is <hi>Ens Simpliciſſimum,</hi> and excludes all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of what kind ſoever, either of Power and Act, of Subſtance and Accident, or Matter and Form: for every mixture doth of neceſſity ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſome pre-exiſting Cauſe to joyn theſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and indeed the very <hi>membra componentia</hi> have in nature a pre-exiſtence to the being ſo compounded: and ſo the admiſſion of any kind of Compoſition, is inconſiſtent with a Firſt Cauſe. And from hence it is evident, that all things that are affirmed concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Firſt Cauſe, are but improper, and ſerve only as notions to render him unto our Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings. 2. From hence it alſo follows that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is affirmed of the Firſt Cauſe is the ſame with his Eſſence, and one the ſame with another, though they are conceived by us under different notions, and conceptions; as for inſtance, we ſee an effect of the Firſt Cauſe, which in caſe of a Man we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive from that habit in Man, which we call Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; and another effect, which in Man we would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude to come from ſuch a quality or habit, which we know by the name of Juſtice: hence we ſtile the Firſt Cauſe Merciful and Juſt; yet in truth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe are proper, for they ſignifie Qualities; neither, if they were proper, were they diſtinct, for they are the ſame one with another, and both the ſame with his Eſſence; otherwiſe it is impoſſible he ſhould be Simple; for ſhould his Being and Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes be ſeveral, he ſhould be compounded of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and Accident; or ſhould the ſame thing, which we call Juſtice, be the ſame with his Eſſence, and not the ſame with his Mercy, he muſt needs conſiſt of ſeveral beings divided one from another: the like for all the reſt of his Attributes: by the ſame Eſſence he is, and he is what he is: they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50435:26"/>
notions in us, but in him neither divided from his being, nor one from another. And hence it likewiſe follows, that though the emanant Actions, that flow from this Firſt Cauſe are different, and repreſented unto us under different Notions, as, this is an act of Power, this of Goodneſs, this of Knowledge or Wiſdom; and upon theſe we frame notions to our ſelves, whereby we repreſent that from whence theſe acts move, by ſeveral Names or Attributes of Mercy, Power, Wiſdom; yet theſe proceed not in truth from ſeveral Qualities in the Firſt Cauſe, but from one ſimple, abſolute, unquali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Being.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. From this conſideration, that he is the Firſt Cauſe and Being, it follows, that he is <hi>Ens Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectiſſimum:</hi> For that is <hi>Perfect</hi> to which nothing is wanting: Now it is impoſſible, that any thing can be wanting to the Firſt Cauſe; for there can be nothing beſides him but what proceeds from him, and that which proceeds from him cannot poſſibly either add any further degree of Perfection to him, or include that Perfection, which was not in the Firſt Cauſe moſt eminently. The Firſt Cauſe had a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiſtence to all things elſe; nothing then could be wanting to his Perfection; becauſe there was nothing elſe but himſelf. The production of the Second Cauſes could not poſſibly include any greater Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection than what was derived to them. It is true in the working of Second Cauſes there may be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of an Effect, that may be more perfect in its kind, than the Cauſe that immediately produced it; as the production of a Worm out of putrefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a Plant out of the Earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but there the Effect is not purely due to the Second Cauſe, but to the Original Operation of the Firſt Cauſe, that did put that activity in the Second Cauſes to produce
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50435:27"/>
ſuch Effects; for every Second Cauſe worketh and moveth in the virtue and efficacy of the Firſt Cauſe, and hath its cauſality from it, as well as its being, without which, though it had its being, it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible it ſhould be operative.</p>
                        <p>This Perfection in the Firſt Cauſe is in truth <hi>incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible,</hi> becauſe impoſſible for humane Underſtanding to receive it without Divine Revelation; and much more impoſſible to comprehend it, becauſe Infinite. Therefore to help our ſelves herein we do, and that rationally, attribute to the Firſt Being that manner of Being, that we find moſt Perfect. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from this Perfection it follows</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That the Firſt Cauſe is <hi>a moſt pure Act</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any mixture of Paſſibility or Power: for if there were any Power, as it ſignifies a ſuſceptibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſome further act or impreſſion, that were an Imperfection; for whatſoever is ſuſceptible of ſome further act, as all Power is, it is impoſſible it ſhould be perfect. And from hence follows <hi>his Omnipotence,</hi> for all inability to do any thing proceeds from the want of activity in the agent to overcome that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, that it finds in the thing to be done. Now in the Firſt Cauſe there wants no activity; for it is a moſt pure Act, and were it not a moſt pure and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Act, it were impoſſible it ſhould be the Firſt Cauſe; becauſe that ſuppoſeth a priority of being in the Cauſe to the Effect, and conſequently requires an Infinite Activity in the Firſt Cauſe, becauſe it muſt produce that which before was not at all; and the motion between being and ſimply not being is infinite, and therefore requires an infinite activity.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. From the conſideration of this Perfection it follows, that this Firſt Being is <hi>a Subſtantial</hi> Act, not an act that flows from another thing, or depends upon another thing; for then he could not be <hi>Ens Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum,</hi>
                           <pb n="15" facs="tcp:50435:27"/>
nor yet <hi>Ens Perfectiſſimum:</hi> but it is an Act ſubſiſting by it ſelf.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. From this conſideration of this Perfection it follows, that he is <hi>Ens Vivens.</hi> Life adds a degree of Perfection to the ſubſtance in which it is: and the more Perfect the Life is, the more perfect the Being: hence the Senſitive Life is perfecter than the Vegetative, and the Rational Life than the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive, and the Life of a Spirit than the Life of a Body. Now this Firſt Cauſe, being an Infinite and Pure Act, he hath an infinite perfect Life.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. From hence it follows, that he is <hi>an Intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Being;</hi> and as all his Works beſpeak him ſo, ſo doth this conſideration of his Perfection neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evidence it, for otherwiſe he ſhould not be Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, becauſe an Intellectual Being is a more Perfect Being than that which is not ſo. And this Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Firſt Cauſe is commenſurate to his Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, <hi>viz.</hi> Infinite and Eternal, whereby he perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeeth himſelf, and all things elſe that are or can be, in one Eternal Indiviſible act. And from hence riſeth the <hi>Omniſcience</hi> of the Firſt Cauſe, without which he could not be Perfect: for if any thing, that is or might be, were hid from him, then by the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of that to him, he would receive a degree of Perfection, that he had not before. And this Knowledge hath a threefold Object:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. His own Eſſence, which requires an Infinite Knowledge to comprehend it, becauſe an Infinite Eſſence.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. All things that are; for his Knowledge being Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, it muſt neceſſarily extend to all other things.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. All things that may be, becauſe otherwiſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a further act of his Power, that ſhould be a new extenſion of his Knowledge, which ſtands not with his Perfection.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="16" facs="tcp:50435:28"/>And all this with one Eternal Indiviſible act, not by Succeſſion, not by mediate repreſentation. <hi>Such Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is too wonderful for me.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="5">5. From hence it follows, that he is <hi>Ens Liberri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum:</hi> though he be moſt neceſſarily what he is, yet he is free: firſt, for that the Freedom in agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is a degree of Perfection above a neceſſary agent, and therefore this Liberty muſt of neceſſity be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the Firſt Cauſe. Again, it is impoſſible but that the Firſt Cauſe muſt be a Free Agent, for whatſoever works neceſſarily, hath that neceſſity put upon it by ſomewhat without it, which is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the Firſt Cauſe; for if any thing elſe did put that neceſſity of working in him, then that which impoſeth that neceſſity was the Firſt Cauſe. Again every Neceſſary Agent, <hi>omnibus aequè diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> works uniformly; now nothing was as equally diſpoſed to become ſomething from Eternity, as at the firſt production of any thing, the motion from not being to a being, being the adequate effect of the Firſt Cauſe: therefore if there were not a Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in the Firſt Cauſe, the firſt Effect had been as ancient as the Firſt Being. Therefore we muſt neceſſarily affirm, concerning the Firſt Being, that he is <hi>Ens Liberrimum &amp; Voluntarium,</hi> and that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Will he worketh.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. From hence it follows, that he is <hi>Ens ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mè Bonum.</hi> Concerning this Goodneſs of God we affirm</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That it is <hi>an Eſſential Goodneſs,</hi> and his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is not any thing divided from his Eſſence, for that is inconſiſtent with his Simplicity, ſo that his Eſſence is his Goodneſs, and his Goodneſs the ſame with his Eſſence; which is alſo to be obſerved in all his Attributes, though our Underſtanding cannot apprehend this Indiviſible Being all at once, but
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:50435:28"/>
ſtep by ſtep. And from hence it follows that whatſoever may be affirmed concerning his Eſſence, may be likewiſe affirmed concerning his goodneſs, <hi>viz.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. That it is <hi>Infinite,</hi> for ſo is his eſſence. The Eſſential goodneſs of an Infinite Being muſt needs be Infinite: and hence it is not capable of any increaſe or diminution: and therefore the production of the Effects, and the Communication of his goodneſs to them, did neither add unto, nor take from his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That it is <hi>Perfect;</hi> for that which is Infinite muſt needs be Perfect, becauſe it excludes any mixture of any thing that is not good.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. That it is <hi>Eternal,</hi> that is evident, for it is the ſame with his Eternal being.</p>
                        <p>Now from this conſideration of the goodneſs of the firſt Being ariſe theſe Concluſions:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That he is <hi>Perfectly and ſelf-ſufficiently Happy;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in the enjoyment of himſelf he enjoys an Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite goodneſs, which is the ſame with his being, and impoſſible to be ſevered from it. Good is of its own nature the object of deſire; the deſire and the object being ſevered breedeth pain and unhappineſs; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of good to the deſire is fruition; and if the good be proportionable to the deſire of (it), then in the Union of that good to the deſire there is a full reſt and complacency. Now the firſt cauſe is moved with an Infinite love (as I may with fear ſay) to that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite good, which is moſt Eſſentially and Indiviſibly the ſame with himſelf, and conſequently he hath an Infinite reſt and complacency in himſelf, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the contribution of any thing without him; for he had the ſame boundleſs happineſs in himſelf before the exiſtence of any effect, as he had after, becauſe he had the ſame meaſure of goodneſs, and the ſame
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50435:29"/>
perfect fruition of it before any ſuch production, as after; the productions of new effects are the emanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons only of his Eſſence, and produced no alteration in him; neither did it dilate his Eſſential goodneſs, or add a new degree of fruition of good to what he before had; for he loved the productions of his Will in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and for himſelf.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That the Firſt Being, as it is the Firſt Cauſe of all things; ſo it is <hi>the Supream End of all things,</hi> becauſe he is the Supream Good, and the only adequate ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of himſelf. So that in the production of any effect, the effect that was produced, or any thing without the Firſt Being, could not be the ultimate End, for which it ſhould be produced; for his Will was and is filled with an Infinite Good, <hi>viz.</hi> himſelf. So that it was impoſſible he ſhould take any thing into that Will, which was not in order to himſelf: He made all things for his own ſelf. And upon this ground it follows that nothing without him is an End to it ſelf, becauſe he, that is the Firſt Cauſe of all things, muſt needs be he, that muſt be the Maſter and appointer of the End of all things ſo cauſed.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. From hence it follows that <hi>all the Goodneſs, that is in the Creature, is nothing elſe but the print or impreſſion of that Goodneſs,</hi> which is in the Firſt Being, though ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the different degrees of things the impreſſions are more or leſs genuine; for it is impoſſible that any thing can be denominated Good, but by a conformity in ſome meaſure to that which is the Firſt Goodneſs. That conformity is nothing elſe but that impreſſion of Divine Goodneſs upon the Creature. This impreſſion of the Goodneſs of the Firſt Cauſe upon the Creature is not by any tranſmiſſion of any part of the Eſſential Goodneſs of the Firſt Being into the Effect, for that is incommunicable; nor by any phyſical action of that Goodneſs upon another thing, but the mere will of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50435:29"/>
the Firſt Mover. Now we find <hi>a fourfold Goodneſs</hi> in the Creature.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. An <hi>Eſſential</hi> Goodneſs, which is communicated with the very being of it: thus every thing that is, is Good in it ſelf (though relatively it may be evil) becauſe in that it is, it is conformable to the Firſt Cauſe, who wills it to be. This Goodneſs in any being is that by reaſon whereof every thing deſires it ſelf, and is moved to its own preſervation, and is intrinſecal to the being of the thing.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. An <hi>Intrinſecal,</hi> but not an Eſſential, Goodneſs; when a thing hath all thoſe qualities or requiſites in it ſelf, which are ſuitable and conducible to thoſe acts and operations that belong to the degree of its being, and the variety of the degrees in theſe qualities deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate it more or leſs Good: thus were all Creatures in their Original perfectly Good: though every kind had a ſeveral degree of Perfection, yet every thing had a perfection in its kind. This Goodneſs is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe communicated from the Firſt Being. And the ſuitableneſs of thoſe qualities in the creatures to the exigencies of their own conditions do moſt evidently manifeſt the impreſſion of that Goodneſs, that is in the Firſt Being.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>Relative or Communicative</hi> Goodneſs, <hi>viz,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by one thing is conducible or uſeful for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or perfection of another thing, and is therefore deſirable or good for it: for though the Eſſential Goodneſs of any thing, being as indiviſible is the Eſſence it ſelf, and therefore in that abſtract notion is not capable of degrees, yet there are degrees of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which a finite being is capable of, and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent degrees of perfection in ſeveral beings in their concrete notion, as a Man is a more perfect being than a Beaſt, a Spirit than a Man, though one be as equal a being as the other. This then imports four things:</p>
                        <p n="1">
                           <pb n="20" facs="tcp:50435:30"/>1. A Vacuity or abſence of ſome Good, whereof that being is receptible, and conſequently a receptibility of that which may ſupply it.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. A Motion or Deſire of that being, that hath this vacuity and receptibility, unto that which may ſupply it, and a deſire of Union to it, this it hath from the cauſe of its being; for the cauſe of its being muſt needs be the cauſe of this appetite or motion to its farther perfection; and this is ſometimes ſo ſtrong and active that it carries the creature by way of conſequence to the deſtruction of that being, which at preſent it hath, to attain a higher being.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. A proportion between the Vacuity or neceſſity of the ſubject deſiring to the thing deſired: as a Man to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply his Hunger deſires not Cloaths, but Meat; and when cold, deſires not Meat, but Cloaths; becauſe theſe hold proportion to that exigence that the creature deſires to fill: And hence it is that Temporal Good ſatisfies not a Spiritual ſubſtance, nor a Spiritual Good ſatisfies a Carnal ſubſtance, becauſe they are not proportionable.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. An Activity in the Good deſired to apply it ſelf to the ſupply of that exigence which deſires it, and to unite it ſelf to it. All theſe do infallibly evidence the Goodneſs of the Firſt Being communicated to the ſecond Being: for who put into the Creature a Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or deſire to unite it ſelf to that which might ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply its want? who framed a proportionable Good to that Vacuity and deſire? who placed that Activity in any thing to let out and unite that Goodneſs, that is in it, to that deſire and Vacuity? the very warmth of our Cloaths, the nutriment of our bodies, do beſpeak an Infinite Rational Communicative Goodneſs, that defined theſe correſpondencies, and hath taught the creatures thoſe mutual motions for their own and each others Good, while they themſelves know not what or why they do it.</p>
                        <p n="7">
                           <pb n="21" facs="tcp:50435:30"/>7. From the former conſiderations it follows moſt evidently that he is <hi>moſt Juſt,</hi> and that it is impoſſible he can be otherwiſe, and this as it neceſſarily reſults from the admiſſion of his Goodneſs (for <hi>Juſtice</hi> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but Goodneſs in a rational Being indued with Will) ſo it flows from this conſideration that he is the Firſt Cauſe of all things. Nothing can be ſaid <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt</hi> which is not contrary to the prohibition of ſome Law given by ſomething that can exact obedience to it: Nothing can give the Firſt Being a Law or Rule but his own will, and conſequently he can do nothing but what is moſt Juſt, becauſe it is impoſſible that any thing elſe can be a Rule of Juſtice but himſelf: not any thing without him, for then he were not the Firſt Being; not his creature, for over that he hath a moſt ſupream and abſolute dominion; How can that which receives his being, his ſubſiſtence, his rules of Juſtice from the Firſt Being, preſcribe a rule to him, by whom it is, or exact the performance of it? So that nothing can be the rule of Juſtice to him but his own will; and therefore what he wills cannot be but Juſt, becauſe he wills it: and as it is impoſſible for him to act but what he wills; ſo it is impoſſible for him to will but what is Juſt, becauſe his will is the only rule of his Juſtice: and though <hi>ex natura rei</hi> he might have willed what he doth not will, yet that which he had ſo willed had been juſt, yet <hi>de facto</hi> the act of his will being Eternal and immutable, it is impoſſible any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt thing ſhould be done by him, becauſe impoſſible he ſhould do contrary to his own will, which is the only meaſure and rule of Juſtice.</p>
                        <p>And from this we may clearly evidence,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That there is a moſt abſolute <hi>unlimited Dominion and Power</hi> in the Firſt Cauſe over its Effects, and he is bound unto it by no other obligation but his own Will, which though it doth manifeſt it ſelf in all Mercy,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50435:31"/>
and Tenderneſs, and Goodneſs, and Wiſdom towards it, yet it is only becauſe it is his Good will ſo to do.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That therefore <hi>whatſoever Rule or Law the Firſt Cauſe doth preſcribe</hi> to his creature, that is capable of a Law, it <hi>ought unqueſtionably to be ſubmitted unto;</hi> for what ſoever he wills muſt needs be juſt, inaſmuch as there is no meaſure of Juſtice or Injuſtice but his will, although we are not to look upon any thing required by the Firſt Cauſe but flowing from a moſt Wiſe, as well as a moſt abſolute Will, and ſo holding a proportion with the ability of that creature from whom it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. From hence we find where is <hi>the Original of all Juſtice</hi> in the World; it muſt all be reſolved into that will of the Firſt Cauſe, and that in a double reſpect:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. In reſpect of <hi>Conformity;</hi> for were there no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe Law given to rational creatures, it is true there could be no <hi>Obligation,</hi> yet a Conformity in the actions of rational creatures to the ſimilar actions of the Firſt Cauſe towards his Creature would be Comely and Juſt in a rational Creature: and queſtionleſs as the irrational Creatures have certain Inſtincts planted in them by their firſt creation, which though they are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly Laws, but Inclinations, to Man, as he came out of the hands of his Maker with the impreſſion of his Image upon him, had ſome conformity to the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Juſtice without any reference to any Command, which is not clean loſt, but even in Men without edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation doth ſtrangely manifeſt it ſelf in divers parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 In reſpect of <hi>Obligation;</hi> for there can be nothing imaginably Unjuſt, without theſe two conſiderations, <hi>viz.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. A Law commanding or forbidding a thing under a pain: whatſoever falls not within the command or Prohibition is permitted, and cannot be unjuſt.</p>
                        <p n="2">
                           <pb n="23" facs="tcp:50435:31"/>2. A Power to exact an Obedience to that Law, and to inflict the puniſhment that follows upon the breach of this Law. Otherwiſe the Law were ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and vain.</p>
                        <p>Now as to the firſt, without all queſtion the Firſt Cauſe, in the firſt creation of reaſonable creatures, did, by what way we know not, give him a Law, whereby he ſhould live, and which he traduced to his poſterity as the Commands of the Firſt Cauſe, though in ſucceſſion of time thoſe grew weaker and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupter every day than other. Theſe are thoſe <hi>Jura Naturalia,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Of the Law of Nature, the Author hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a particular tract.</note> which have an influence into all the Laws of Men, as to worſhip God, to keep our Promiſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and when we come ſo far as to be perſwaded that they are the Laws of God, then it binds in a fear to offend, becauſe thereby we become liable to puniſhment, which we are ſure he hath Power and Right to inflict, his <hi>Power</hi> being univerſal and unavoidable, and his <hi>Right,</hi> and Dominion over his creature abſolute and uncontrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
                        <p>Thus we find a plain Obligation in thoſe Laws that are given by the Firſt Cauſe, and conſequently ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting ſuch a Law, we have a clear Rule, whereby to meaſure what's Juſt, and what's Unjuſt: and when I can reſolve any thing into the Command or Prohibition of this Law, I find my ſelf bound in Conſcience, <hi>viz.</hi> under pain of Guilt, to obey. If I enter into a ſociety and agree to be bound by the Laws, that the greater number of that Society makes, they make a Law: here be now but two things that can bind me to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this Law, and conſequently to denominate my diſobedience thereunto Unjuſtice, <hi>viz.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Power of the Society, but that is but a thing extrinſecal, I may avoid their power, and then I am
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50435:32"/>
abſolved; and if external power were enough to deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate my diſobedience Unjuſtice, then if I could procure a power to overmatch theirs, their obedience to their own Law were injuſtice.</p>
                        <p>The Promiſe and agreement to ſubmit to that Law ſo made: but what is that that binds me to keep my promiſe? if nothing binds me to it, then is not my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience any Unjuſtice; for the obligation of the Law is reſolved into my agreement; and if nothing above me bind me to keep my agreement, I have no obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation at all upon me: therefore the Dominion, Power and Juſtice of the Firſt Cauſe is the only Bond, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are bound, and whereunto all Humane Juſtice is to be reſolved both in point of Conformity as to its Pattern, and Obligation as to its Law.</p>
                        <p>But how theſe Laws were at firſt given to Man, whether by a formal Command, or whether by an immediate Impreſſion in the underſtanding and will, or whether by an implanted Propenſion or inclination in the will, or partly by one, partly by another, it is not eaſy to determine. <hi>Sed vide infra.</hi> But what ever way it was, it is impoſſible to have any notion or imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of juſt or unjuſt among Men, without reſolving it in its original into the Rule or Law that was given to Men by the Firſt Cauſe of our being.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. From the conſideration of the Firſt Cauſe and of the premiſſes, it muſt needs follow, that he is <hi>Immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:</hi> for Mutability is inconſiſtent</p>
                        <p n="1">1. With his Perfection. It is impoſſible that a Pure Act can have any Change; for all Change doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily infer Paſſibility and Receptibility of what it had not before: and to ſuppoſe that, were to conclude he were not <hi>Actus Simpliciſſimus</hi> &amp; <hi>Perfectiſſimus;</hi> for all Receptibility imports <hi>Potentiam</hi> or <hi>Paſſibilitatem.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. It is inconſiſtent with his Eternity: for all Changes too of neceſſity ſuppoſe a Succeſſion of Duration in
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50435:32"/>
the thing changed; it is not to every intent the ſame ſimply, that it was before it had that change, which doth of neceſſity import Succeſſion, which is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with Eternity; for whatſoever is Eternal hath no Succeſſion, and conſequently whatſoever is affirmed of it at one inſtant muſt neceſſarily be affirmed of it Eternally: this cannot ſtand with any change; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that change, that could not be affirmed of him, which might be affirmed after, if it ſhould be admitted.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. It is inconſiſtent with his Simplicity. Some things have accidental changes, which yet in Eſſence continue the ſame, as from ignorance to knowledge, from one colour to another: but ſuch accidental changes cannot be in that, which is <hi>Ens Simpliciſſimum,</hi> becauſe there can be nothing in him, which is not his Eſſence.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. It is inconſiſtent with his Infinitude; for to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever any thing can be added that it had not before, that cannot be Infinite, becauſe ſtill capable of a farther acceſſion.</p>
                        <p>And as this Immutability is affirmed of the Firſt Cauſe in point of his Eſſence and Nature, ſo in ſome reſpects it is concerning <hi>his Acts.</hi> Theſe are of two kinds, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Immanent Acts,</hi> ſuch are the Acts of his underſtanding and Will; and theſe are Immutable as well as his Eſſence, for indeed they are but notio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally divided from it. In us our Will is one thing and our willing another, but that is inconſiſtent with the Simplicity of the Firſt Cauſe; hence it is that as his Eſſence, ſo his Will is immutable; he wills nothing now but what he ever willed, and underſtood from Eternity what he now knows; for Eternity hath neither <hi>now</hi> nor <hi>then</hi> in it.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The <hi>Emanant Acts;</hi> thoſe are nothing elſe but the Execution of that Immutable Will; theſe are ſubject to mutation, but without the leaſt mutation, either in the Eſſence or will of the Firſt Cauſe.</p>
                        <p n="1">
                           <pb n="26" facs="tcp:50435:33"/>1. Not in his Eſſence. It is true here is a new relation that was not before: for when the Firſt Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing produced an Effect, it is true the Relation of a Cauſe and an Effect is now produced, which was not before, and ſo when more Effects are produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, the Relations are multiplied; but Relations breed no Change at all in the ſubject concerning whom they are affirmed: the being was the ſame before it put forth it ſelf in a cauſation, as it was before; it doth of neceſſity import a change in the thing effected, <hi>viz.</hi> a motion <hi>à non eſſe ſimpliciter,</hi> or <hi>à non eſſe tale,</hi> but not in the Cauſe, which had an abſolute being before, though not actually as a Cauſe before.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Not in his Will. It is true, when any Effect is produced that was not before, here is an execution of what was not before, but the will of that to be then was from all Eternity. Again when a being is either changed or annihilated, that is not by a Change of the will in the Firſt Cauſe, but only in the term or execution of that Will; for by the ſame indiviſible and eternal act of his Will, he willed this or that to be made, and after to be annihilated in time; the Change is in the <hi>terminus</hi> or execution of his Will, not in the Will, or the Immanent Act of it.</p>
                        <p>But how can we then conceive that there ſhould be one Immutable Act of his Will, when a thing is paſt? How can he be ſaid to will that which is already executed and paſt? <note n="*" place="margin">That the Willing ſtill continues the ſame, ſhall be, and is, and hath been, are the ſeveral relations of the thing willed, which is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of theſe ſucceſſions of duration: they are not rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that may fall upon that will which is incapable of them, or upon the acts of it.</note> For which we muſt return to what hath been ſaid, <hi>viz.</hi> that paſt, and to come, are but the meaſure of Succeſſive Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and therefore though they are applicable to them, yet they are not applicable to an Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Being or Act; the meaſures of ſucceſſive motion
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:50435:33"/>
do not fit Eternity, which, though it be a Duration, that conſiſts with the Succeſſive Motion and Duration of the Creature, yet, it holds no proportion with it. The Motion of the Heavens, though 10000 times ſwifter than the motion of a Tortois, have yet a proportion one to another, becauſe both ſucceſſive, and ſo Time meaſures both: But the Duration of the Firſt Cauſe is the Durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of an Indiviſible Being, and conſequently holds not proportion with Succeſſion. And hence it is, that it is but our groſs conception that do imagine any part of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity paſt, or any part to come, or that Time doth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the fore part of Eternity from the future part of Eternity: It is an indiviſible permanent Duration, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing paſt, nothing future, but the ſame fixed inſtant; conſequently the Act of the Divine will always one, always preſent. <hi>This Knowledge is too wonderful for me.</hi>

                        <p>THUS far have we proceeded in thoſe inquiries, which rectified Reaſon ſuggeſts to us concerning the Nature of the Firſt Cauſe: Now we conſider <hi>the Emanant Acts of his Will and Power</hi> upon things without him; for from this conſideration, that he is the Firſt Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it likewiſe follows that All things beſides him muſt needs have their being and ſubſiſtence from him. This falls into theſe two <hi>Concluſions:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. That all thing beſides himſelf have their being from him.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That all things are directed and governed unto their ſeveral Ends by him.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="28" facs="tcp:50435:34"/>Touching the former, <hi>viz. That all things beſides him have their original being from him,</hi> that is a neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent of the admiſſion of a Firſt being: for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is not firſt, there was a time when it was not; for otherwiſe it muſt be eternal, the contrary whereof is before evidenced. That then which once was not, and now is, and conſequently had a beginning of its being, could not have it from it ſelf; for nothing hath a power or activity of it ſelf to produce any thing; therefore that ſecond being muſt needs be produced by the Firſt Being; the <hi>conſequences</hi> whereof are theſe.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That all things except the Firſt Cauſe had a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of their being, and conſequently there was no Eternal Matter, out of which any thing was made.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That all Beings had their firſt being from him that is the Firſt Being. This is evident by what goes before.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. That the firſt production of all things by the Firſt Being is purely and ſolely by way of Efficiency; and not by derivation of ſubſtance from himſelf? for that is impoſſible; his Eſſence is Immaterial and Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The manner of this Efficiency, or his Cauſality is not any act diſtinct from himſelf, but only the me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>e act of his mere Will, which is eſſentially the ſame with himſelf, and with his Infinite Power.</p>
                        <p>And herein the firſt production of ſecond Beings differs from that manner of cauſation, which is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary in ſubſequent productions of things: for the firſt production of beings was an infinite motion, <hi>viz.</hi> from a ſimple not-being to a being, and therefore was acted immediately by the Infinite Power and Will of the Firſt Cauſe, there being no inſtrument to be uſed; or if it had been, yet any inſtrument had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely diſproportionable to ſuch a motion. But in the ſubſequent production of moſt things, the matter pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiſting,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:50435:34"/>
and ſo the motion not being <hi>à non eſſe ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citer,</hi> the cauſation of the Firſt Cauſe is by inſtruments and ſecond Cauſes.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. That as the firſt production of all things was the immediate act of his will, ſo the diſpoſing of all things into that Order and frame, wherein they now are, was the immediate Act of his Will, and Power, and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. This is evident upon a double ground, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt becauſe whatſoever had its being from another, had its <hi>eſſe tale</hi> from him. 2. It is not conceptible that if all the things in the World had been put together, they being all irrational ſubſtances, they ſhould ever have marſhalled themſelves into that order they are in, unleſs the Firſt Being had ſo willed it. And if it ſhould be admitted that the Forms and Qualities of the ſeveral beings would naturally have inclined them to their ſeveral places and ſtations, which though all things had been wrapt together, would by degrees have ſevered and taken their places. That as it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to imagine would ever have been, unleſs the ſubſtances themſelves as well as their active qualities had been divided: ſo if it were granted, it were equally to be reſolved into the Will of the firſt Being to put ſuch Forms, Qualities and Inclinations in things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to, and effecting ſuch an order, as if that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Fabrick of things had been by the immediate call of every thing into its Order and Rank by the Firſt Cauſe.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. That the production of Mankind eſpecially was the immediate work of the Firſt Being. This is touched before.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. That all theſe Activities that are in Second Cauſes are put into them by the Firſt Cauſe, and they work in the virtue of the Firſt Cauſe; ſo that although the Effect be not the immediate production of the Firſt Cauſe, yet the Activity and Power, that is put in the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:50435:35"/>
ſecond Cauſe to work, is originally due to the Firſt Cauſe. And hence it is that a more ignoble being doth produce ſometimes a being of a higher nature than it ſelf, as the Earth produceth Vegetables, Putrefaction Senſibles, becauſe the vigor and Activity that cauſeth it, was at firſt put into the ſecond cauſes by the Firſt: ſo that though they move uniformly, <hi>omnibus rectè diſpoſitis,</hi> yet they act <hi>in virtute Primae Cauſae.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="8">8. Though Second Cauſes work naturally and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly for the moſt part, where all things are equally diſpoſed, and this by the virtue of that Activity, which by the will and Power of the Firſt Cauſe was at firſt put in them, yet this Activity is managed and ordered ſo that it neither breaks the Law of its cauſality or motion, that was at firſt put into it, nor yet diſturbs or diſorders the univerſal fabrick of Nature, things being at firſt framed in that order, that each ſhould be a corrective to the other in caſe of exorbitancy, <hi>de hoc infra.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="9">9. From hence it follows that the conſtant and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form <hi>Courſe of Nature</hi> is not to be attributed to it ſelf, but only to the Will of the Firſt Cauſe, that wills it to continue in that frame, though he hath ordained Means ſubſervient to that end.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. From hence it follows that as all things <hi>in actu primo</hi> owe their being to the will of the Firſt Cauſe, conſtant and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form <hi>Courſe of Nature</hi> is not to to be attributed to itſelf, but only to the Will of the Firſt Cauſe, that wills it to continue in that frame, though he hath ordained Means ſubſervient to the will of the Firſt Cauſe, ſo <hi>in actu ſecundo, viz.</hi> their continuance and ſubſiſtence is due only, to that Will: they were made becauſe he willed it, and they continue becauſe he wills it. And this, as it is moſt true in reſpect of the whole frame of Nature, which hath no adequate means of its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence, but the Will of the Firſt Cauſe; ſo it is true likewiſe, as in the beings, ſo in the continued ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence of Second Cauſes, which though they are, and are ſupported immediately by Second Cauſes, Qualities and concurrences, yet the Activity and Power, that
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:50435:35"/>
is in theſe Second Cauſes to produce or continue theſe Effects, is due to the Firſt Cauſe, and continues in them by virtue of that Will, that at firſt planted it in them.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The <hi>Diſpoſing of all things to their ſeveral Ends,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remote or near, belongs to this Firſt Cauſe.</p>
                        <p>Every Intellectual Agent works for ſome End or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the Firſt Cauſe we have ſhewed to be an Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual Agent; therefore what he works, he works for ſome End anſwerable to the Work and Worker, and it muſt of neceſſity be that he that is the Firſt Cauſe, or Efficient of all things, muſt needs be the appointer of his own End in that Work.</p>
                        <p>The End, though it be laſt in execution, is firſt in intention; for it moves the Agent to the work, or otherwiſe, though he work not without an Event, he doth it without an End. Now that which is firſt in Efficiency muſt needs be the firſt deſigner of his own End, which is but the reſult of his Work; A Second Cauſe, though he may have an End in his Cauſation proportionable to the cauſality wherewith he is indued; yet as his Efficiency is ſubordinate to, and derived from the Efficiency of the Firſt Cauſe, ſo muſt his End be: it may be an Ultimate End in reſpect of it, it is but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlocutory, or rather no End at all, in reſpect of the Firſt Cauſe, but only a means conducing to the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the End of the firſt Cauſe. When a paſſionate Ambitious or Covetous Man drives mainly and wholly at the ſatisfaction of thoſe luſts as his End, and that End draws out his activity and ſtrength to compaſs them, yet a wiſe Stateſman, according to the convenience or exigence of the Publick, can manage and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this Ambition, and the Satisfaction thereof unto a higher End, which the other never ſo much as dream'd of.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="32" facs="tcp:50435:36"/>As we therefore divide all Beings and Cauſes into Firſt and Second, ſo we diſtinguiſh all Ends into the Ends of the Firſt Cauſe, and of Second Cauſes. Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>the End of the Firſt Cauſe,</hi> we ſay it is <hi>twofold.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. That which is the End <hi>in reſpect of himſelf.</hi> This is nothing but the Satisfaction of his own Will. As we muſt reſolve the being of all things into the Will of the Firſt Cauſe in point of Efficiency, ſo in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect we muſt reſolve all things into that ſame Will in point of Finality; and this is the moſt adequate and Ultimate reſolution of all things, they are becauſe he wills them to be. For the Firſt Cauſe, being abſolutely and infinitely Perfect and Good, cannot originally be moved by any thing without him; that would import a Paſſibility, <hi>viz.</hi> to be moved and impulſed to any thing by any thing without him; and an Imperfection, which might be ſupplyed by the acquiſition of that End, for which he works: both theſe are neceſſarily to be admitted in any caſe, where any End extrinſecal to the Efficient it ſelf is admitted: for 1. the End hath an impulſion or action upon the efficient, and 2. it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſuppoſes a vacuity or emptineſs <hi>quoad hoc,</hi> which ſhall be ſupplied with that End acquired, be it an End of Supplement or Delight. Neither of theſe are poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to be admitted in the Firſt, who is an Infinite Good commenſurate to the Infinite meaſure of his own Will. The Final Cauſe then of all things is, He wills becauſe He wills. His Glory is a conſequence of his Work in the Work, not the ultimate End of his Work, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe nothing that he made can contribute ought to his Glory or Happineſs.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. In reſpect <hi>of the thing produced,</hi> the ordination of every particular thing to its particular End, either in order to it ſelf, or to ſome thing elſe, or both, the Intermediate Ends of all things being different accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their ſeveral natures and the ſeveral diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:50435:36"/>
of the Divine will. That this may be ſo, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent upon the conſideration of that Infiniteneſs of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Power and Preſence of the Firſt Cauſe, which before is conſidered: and that it muſt be ſo is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe evident upon the conſideration before expreſſed, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Will of the Firſt Cauſe is the Cauſe of all beings and operations in the World: Nothing can be, unleſs he wills it to be: and this will muſt needs be extended to every individual thing and motion in the World, for as well as any might evade the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of his will, all things might.</p>
                        <p>There be three degrees of things, Natural, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent, and Voluntary: Now the Means of carrying things merely <hi>Natural</hi> to their ſeveral Ends, ordinarily is that Rule and Order, which he hath ſet in things Natural, and thoſe Propenſions and Inclinations, which are planted in things, to the obſervance of that Law. Now this hath <hi>a threefold reference</hi> to the Firſt Cauſe:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Of Poſition or giving; for it is not imaginable that this Rule was taken up by the things themſelves: the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> and the Frame, order and Courſe of thing according to that Law, doth moſt neceſſarily conclude a Lawgiver, and although the motion of the Law or Rule of Nature is for the moſt part uniform, yet it doth in no ſort follow that therefore it moved not from a voluntary Agent. But though it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely ſpeaks his Wiſdom, that did ſo foreſee and order all things, that one uniform Law or Rule ſhould ſerve, without any alteration; for a change of a Rule imports Imperfection in the Rule, and a want of fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight, in him that makes it, of thoſe emergencies that induce ſuch an alteration. Now in as much as nothing could be, but it was firſt in the Will of the Firſt Cauſe, and conſequently in his Knowledg, all thoſe Propenſions, Rules and Orders of Nature, which he hath put into things, are exactly ſubſervient to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:50435:37"/>
thoſe purpoſes, and conſequently to the effects produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by it.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Of Concurrence with it, all things depending upon the Firſt Cauſe, as well in the ſupport as in the Original of its ſubſiſtence.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Of Subordination to it. Hence it is that extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily the Ordinary Rule of Nature is intermitted: for though the moſt exact uniform Rule unalterable in the leaſt point may nevertheleſs proceed from a Free Agent, becauſe the uniformity of the Rule pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds not from it ſelf, but becauſe the Firſt Cauſe wills it to be ſo, and yet hath exactly fitted it to the bringing about his Ends; yet becauſe Mankind is apt to miſtake, ſometimes there is an intermiſſion or interruption of that Courſe of Nature: this Subordination likewiſe appears by the Direction and forming of it to ſpecial purpoſes, wherein whiles the Second Cauſe moves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Rule of Nature that is ſet in it, yet by the Concatenation and Conjuncture of other things, which happily moved naturally thither, ſome ſtrange effect is produced beyond the reach of that Natural Agent: as when an Artificer, by conjuncture of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things together, makes uſe of the natural motion of the Lead poiſe to work a circular, or other ſtrange motion in a Clock or Engine.</p>
                        <p>Now the Law or Rule of Nature, as in divers other particulars, ſo in theſe it moſt evidently ſheweth it ſelf to be nothing elſe but the Courſe, that the great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the World hath put in things.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Thoſe Propenſions that are in things for their own Preſervation and Protection. Hence thoſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Inanimate things as it were to their ſeveral homes and ſtations appointed by the Firſt Cauſe, Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication of their kinds, Specifical Inclinations inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to a whole kind.</p>
                        <p n="2">
                           <pb n="35" facs="tcp:50435:37"/>2. The Subſerviency of one thing to the uſe and exigence of another, wherein for the moſt part the more Imperfect is ſtill ſubſervient to the more Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and all to Man.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The Diſpoſition of things in thoſe places and ranks as may be moſt uſefull, and as may beſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent that diſorder and confuſion, which contrary qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities would produce; as appears in the Elements, in hurtful creatures.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The Subordination of the particular Inclinations and Diſpoſitions of any particular to the prevention of that which is contrary to the Law of the univerſe.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. The admirable Concurrence of things indued with contrary qualities and deſtructive each to other in t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>

                           </gap>onſtitution of mixt bodies, ſhewing a hand that tempers and overrules them in their operations and cauſalities.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Contingent</hi> Effects. In reality there is nothing in the World Contingent, becauſe every thing that hath bin, is, or ſhall be, is praedetermined by an Immutable Will of the Firſt Being: But we therefore call a thing <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent</hi> becauſe either we find no conſtant Rule or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of the immediate cauſe to the production of the effect, or an effect reſulting out of the conjunction of cauſes that have no natural connexion one with another. When the Prophet that propheſied againſt <hi>Bethel,</hi> returned back, met the Lion, and the Lion ſlew him, here was a Voluntary Act in the Prophet, <hi>viz.</hi> to go, a Contingent Act in the meeting with the Lion, a Natural Act in the Lion to kill him: now becauſe this death of the Prophet had no neceſſary connexion with all the cauſes that concurred to it, neither had the journey of the Prophet any neceſſary connexion with the walk of the Lion that they muſt needs meet, the death of the Prophet, though it had a kind of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural connexion with the next cauſe that preceded it,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:50435:38"/>
was in the eſtimation of Men Contingent; yet in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of that predetermination that was of all this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, (which was not therefore predetermined becauſe ſpoken by the old Prophet, who had only a revelation of That counſel) the whole frame of this buſineſs was neceſſary, yet note that this predetermination did not alter the nature of the intermediate cauſes: the jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of the Prophet was nevertheleſs voluntary, the meeting with the Lyon Contingent, the death of the Prophet by the Lyon in effect neceſſary. So the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Predetermination of Effects predetermines them in their ſeveral Cauſes, and takes not away the truth of the denomination of Neceſſary, Contingent, and Voluntary: it predetermines the being of each; but the being of the firſt but to be neceſſarily, becauſe it prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines it to depend upon a neceſſary cauſe, as the Eclipſe of the Sun; it predetermines the being of the ſecond, but to be contingently, becauſe it predeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines it to be upon contingent and unconnexed cauſes; it predetermines the third to be, but to be voluntarily, becauſe it hath predetermined it to be upon a voluntary cauſe. All things to him have the ſame neceſſity of being, though diſtinguiſhed in their manner of being, which are repreſented to our underſtanding under the notions of Neceſſary, Contingent, and Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. We have conſidered the influence of the Firſt Cauſe upon the creature <hi>in actu primo,</hi> which is giving it a being, or creation, and as to things Natural and Contingent, <hi>in actu ſecundo,</hi> which is Providence or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: Now concerning the relation that <hi>Man,</hi> the only <hi>viſible</hi> Intellectual and <hi>Voluntary</hi> being in the World, [hath] We muſt premiſe to this conſideration what hath been partly obſerved, <hi>viz.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. That the firſt diſpoſal of every thing to its ſeveral End doth of right belong to the Firſt Cauſe.</p>
                        <p n="2">
                           <pb n="37" facs="tcp:50435:38"/>2. That this End is twofold: 1. In reſpect of the Firſt Cauſe the mere fulfilling of his own Will: 2. In reſpect of the Creatures: 1. relatively one to another, a Subordination of one thing to and for another, as the more imperfect to the more perfect: 2. abſolutely, the End that is planted in every thing is its own Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Perfection.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. That as the implanted End of every thing is his own being and perfection, ſo the being of things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing different, both in nature and degrees of Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, ſo are their Perfections different, the Perfection of Animate above the Inanimate, the Perfection of the Senſitive above the Animate, and of the Rational above the Senſitive.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. That as the ſeveral Creatures are moved to their ſeveral Preſervations and Perfections, as to their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Ends, ſo they have ſuitable Inclinations, Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions and Motions placed in them conducible to thoſe Ends: as the Motions of Bodies to their ſeveral ſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; the generation of Vegetables, and their attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of ſupplies of nouriſhment anſwerable to their tempers; the fading of Senſitives, and aſſimilation of the nouriſhment to their own nature, ſupplying the decays thereof; Natural Inſtincts of every ſpecies to avoid thoſe things, places, and foods that are deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, providing for varieties of Seaſons, multiplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Species; and infinite the like, which is nothing elſe but that Rule, Law or Means, that the Firſt Cauſe hath put in them for the attaining that End, which he hath put in them, <hi>viz.</hi> their Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Perfection. And this is <hi>the great Wiſdom,</hi> as I may call it, <hi>of the Creature,</hi> that it purſues that End, by that Law, which the Firſt Cauſe hath given it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Mankind</hi> hath ſome things in him common with other inferiour Beings, and in reſpect thereof hath the ſame Natural End, <hi>viz.</hi> the Preſervation of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:50435:39"/>
by the ſame Law of Nature, which he doth, and may, and ought to preſerve, as other Creatures do. But if he have a higher degree of Being than other Creatures, then conſequently he hath theſe <hi>two things different from other Creatures.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. A <hi>higher End</hi> than other Creatures planted in him by the Firſt Cauſe, whereinto he is, or ſhould be carried.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. A <hi>higher and different Law</hi> given by the Firſt Cauſe in order to that End, which whiles he follows he is moſt wiſe, becauſe moſt conformable to the Will of his Maker, and moves to a ſuitable End to himſelf, by a ſuitable Means, and which when he declines, he is more bruitiſh than the Beaſt, becauſe he either moves to no End, or by ſuch a Rule, by which it is impoſſible he ſhould attain it.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Concluſion</hi> then is, That Man was by the Firſt Cauſe made for an End anſwerable to his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection by ſuch a Rule or Law as was by the Firſt Cauſe ordained to be conducible to this End: That therefore all other Ends and Perfections that are below the uttermoſt hight and Perfection of Man may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with this End; for we are not to conceive ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>providently of the Firſt Cauſe, that he ſhould put a thing in ſuch a degree of being, that the Ends and Rules incident to any conſideration of him ſhould be inconſiſtent with his Supream End; all ſtood toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but if by any caſualty it ſhould fall out that there were an inconſiſtency, all the Subordinate Ends muſt give way to this Supream End: That the purſuit of this great End, whatſoever it is, by this Rule, is exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conformable to the Will of the Firſt Cauſe; by this, Man doth two works at once, God's work and his own: That this is the Great Buſineſs of Man, the higheſt act of Wiſdom, deſerves all his labour, ſtudy, and endeavour, and all the reſt of his Buſineſs in the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:50435:39"/>
World is either loſt labour, or worſe, if not ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to this great End.</p>
                        <p>We are therefore to enquire into theſe <hi>three things:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. Wherein conſiſts the Eminence of the being of Man above other Creatures; for without this we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not know that Perfection which muſt be the object of his deſire.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. What is this Perfection, that is thus to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired and attained.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. By what Means, and how it is attainable.</p>

                        <p>THE <hi>Goodneſs of the Wiſe Creator</hi> was <hi>communicated to his Effects,</hi> 1. in giving them a Being, 2. in aſſigning to every thing a portion of Perfection in themſelves anſwerable to the degree of their Being, 3. a Motion or Deſire to the attaining and conſerving that Perfection, and conſequently of their Being, which is the Veſſel wherein that Perfection is held, 4. a Rule or Law wherewith it is indued to regulate and direct and enable his Motions in the attaining of that Deſire.</p>
                        <p>Thus we find in all <hi>Creatures below Man,</hi> every thing moving to its own Preſervation and Perfection by a ſtrong Deſire and conſtant Rule, and enjoying a kind of Happineſs in the Fruition of that End, which the Firſt Cauſe gave it as its Portion: Nay in the very Diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Creature, this is that which moves the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients thereof to part themſelves, or concur in the production of ſome third thing, the thing corrupted ſtruggling nevertheleſs as long as it can to keep it ſelf entire.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="40" facs="tcp:50435:40"/>
                           <hi>Man,</hi> though in his lower part he hath ſomewhat common with other,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>V. Originat</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 2.</note> eſpecially ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Creatures, and therefore in that reſpect reſembles them in his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions Fruitions and Ends; yet he hath ſomething that is of a higher Conſtitution, and conſequently capable of a higher Perfection, whereunto he moves as his End, by a Law or Rule anſwerable to ſo great an End, this latter being of a higher Frame, yet anſwerable to that in other Creaturers, which we call the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Inſtinct, or Natural Inclination.</p>
                        <p>The firſt thing therefore examinable is, <hi>Wherein conſiſts this Perfection of Man above other Creatures:</hi> And queſtionleſs that is <hi>in his Soul,</hi> which actuates, animates, and directs his Body: and therefore before we can find out what is that End, that is anſwerable to the degree of Man's being, we muſt enquire what this Soul is, wherein Man's Perfection conſiſts, whereby we ſhall be able to meaſure out what End will ſerve it.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Soul of Man</hi> is conſiderable:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. In its abſolute <hi>Eſſence</hi> we muſt conclude it to be an <hi>Immterial</hi> Immortal Subſtance. This though it be a certain truth, yet it is impoſſible naturally to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate it: the reaſon is, becauſe nothing can come to our Underſtandings demonſtratively but either by our Senſes, or by Diſcourſe and Reaſons deduced from ſuch things as ſo come to our Senſes. It is true the Firſt Cauſe falls not under our Senſes, yet by neceſſary deduction [from what falls under our Senſes] we neceſſarily conclude, That he is, and in ſome things, What he is: but the Being of the Soul, as it is not conſpicuous to the Senſe, ſo it is not deducible by Demonſtration: it is a Truth which is revealed at firſt ſupernaturally, and afterwards traductively. It is true that when we have the knowledge of it, we may find many reaſons to fortifie it, divers difficulties thereby
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:50435:40"/>
reconciled, which without that admitted were almoſt impoſſible to be broken through; which ſtings the moſt bold and adventurous ſinner or Atheiſt with an invincible ſuſpicion of the truth of this Truths yet I cannot find how merely by Natural Reaſon a Man can firſt find out the truth of this Propoſition, That the Soul is a Subſtance Immaterial. We owe this truth in its original to Divine Revelation, though when diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, the contribution of rectified Reaſon may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it at leaſt probable.</p>
                        <p>But that being granted, it doth of neceſſity follow, that it is <hi>Immortal</hi> and Incorruptible: for that which is Immaterial, is <hi>actus ſimflex,</hi> which excludes a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Matter and Form, not <hi>Simfliciſſimus,</hi> which excludes the compoſition <hi>ex Ente &amp; Eſſentia,</hi> or <hi>ex Actu &amp; Potentia.</hi> Now concerning thoſe Reaſons thoſe Reaſons that conduce to prove the<note n="*" place="bottom">

                        <p n="2">2. In the <hi>Will,</hi> which is carried to affect a Good that falls not within the reach of Senſe, controlls and commands the Senſual Appetite, takes it off from thoſe things which it purſues as naturally and violently as the hungry Lion doth his Prey, and impoſeth a Law of Reaſon upon them.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. From the <hi>Conſcience,</hi> that ſtartles at the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of a horrid Offence, though with the greateſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy and outward ſecurity in the World. <hi>Sed de his. Latius infra.</hi>

                           <pb n="42" facs="tcp:50435:41"/>2. From <hi>the Juſtice of God.</hi> It is queſtionleſs certain, that as God put in the ſeveral Inſtincts and Propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in the inferior Creatures, whereby they are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to their Ends; ſo there was ſome Rule given to Man, that was anſwerable to the ſeveral dimenſions of thoſe Abilities he had above other Creatures, <hi>viz.</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and Will. And queſtionleſs, as thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſions are internal to the inferiour Creatures, and do not only rule their Actions, but alſo their Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſo this Law that was given to Man, extended not only to his outward Actions, but to thoſe inward Motions of his Soul, by the violation of the leaſt part of which Law he incurred a Guilt, which is an Obligation to Puniſhment, according to the Penalty of this Law. Now it is impoſſible that this Juſtice ſhould be executed, conſidering eſpecially the outward diſpenſation of things, without the Object of this Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice ſurvived his Body.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. From <hi>the Wiſdom of God,</hi> who ſurely gave not his Creature an Underſtanding that might arrive to know him, a Will rationally and <hi>ex deliberatione</hi> to obey him, and yet that all this ſhould die with the Body! But who is ſufficient for theſe things?</p>
                        <p>Here is the firſt Eminence then of Man above other things, that he carries about him an Immaterial and Immortal Soul, which ſurvives his Body, and this neceſſarily concludes that the Good, or End, or <hi>Happineſs</hi> anſwerable to this Perfection, cannot be either Material or Mortal.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Not Material,</hi> becauſe it holds not proportion with that Nature and Receptibility of the Soul. And from hence as it is moſt rational to conclude, that any Object of the Senſe can never be that Good that the Soul drives at, ſo it is moſt evident by two Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>

                           <pb n="43" facs="tcp:50435:41"/>1. In the Wearineſs, Nauſeouſneſs, and unſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factorineſs of them. If a Man had all the Wiſdom and Contrivance in the World, and the moſt eager and intenſe deſire after theſe Objects of Senſe, or the Senſual Appetite, that can be imagined, and all thoſe Supplies and Opportunities that might conduce to the filling of theſe Deſires, yet in the midſt of thoſe Enjoyments he would find a Nauſeouſneſs, a Satiety, a Wearineſs. And that is the reaſon that voluptuous Men travel from one Pleaſure to another. Which though they are exquiſitely proportionable to that Senſe they are framed for, yet there is ſomewhat with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, which is ſtill empty and craves, who cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh nor taſt thoſe Enjoyments, and cries after ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that may be more ſutable to it, and the Man not knowing what that is, travels from one thing to another to find ſomewhat to ſatisfie that Deſire, but cannot till he light upon that Good that is Immaterial.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. In that the more Spiritual the Object is, the more ſatisfaction it breeds. Hence the Soul doth in effect Spiritualize all that cometh into it by abſtractions and rational deductions. And from hence among mere natural Men, the Contemplative is the moſt happy, becauſe he fits his Soul with Food in ſome meaſure anſwerable to it. And according to the levity or weight, vanity or reality of the Object, this Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is diverſified.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Not Mortal</hi> or periſhing. As the want of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion between the Immaterial nature of the Soul and Material Objects, renders them unpleaſing and unſatisfactory to the Soul; ſo if there were a ſuitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs between their Natures, yet if there were a ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs in their Duration, it wants that which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily required to Happineſs, or an End anſwerable to the Soul, and that upon a double Reaſon.</p>
                        <p n="1">
                           <pb n="44" facs="tcp:50435:42"/>1. In the Fruition. The very Enjoyment of a ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Good, which I am ſure muſt leave me, mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>gles fear and preapprehenſion of the loſs of my preſent Enjoyment, and conſequently cannot poſſibly be Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. And from hence likewiſe grows that Vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is dipt in the higheſt Enjoyments: every Man in the very Enjoyments, hath the preſent appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of an inevitable future loſs of them, eſpecially in Death, which doth take away that poſſibility of farther uniting of external Objects to Man.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. In the Loſs of it. That cannot be a ſuitable End to an Immortal Being, that muſt be ſevered from it.</p>
                        <p>The Concluſion therefore of this Conſideration is, that the Wiſe Maker of Man, as he hath made him a living corporeal Creature, did put into his hand ſuch a Good, as was common with other Creatures, which he may juſtly enjoy: ſo, as he furniſhed him with an Immaterial Immortal Soul, he did order that Soul to an End anſwerable to it ſelf, and above other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>viz.</hi> an Immaterial Immortal Good. And leſs than this cannot be an End anſwerable to the Wiſdom of the Worker, nor value of the Work.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Thus concerning the Nature of the Soul; now concerning <hi>the Faculties,</hi> whereby it is enabled to move to that End. And theſe have a threefold <hi>uſe:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. Firſt they ſerve as fit Receptacles to entertain, and be united unto that Good, which is the proper End of the Soul, and hold ſome proportion with that Object, wherein the Happineſs of the Soul conſiſts.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. They ſerve as Receptacles to receive that Rule or Law, which muſt conduce to that End, and therefore they are likewiſe fitted for that.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. They ſerve as Helps and Inſtruments actively to move to that End. theſe three are ſeen likewiſe in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Creatures: 1. They have a Receptibility of that Good, which is anſwerable to their Nature: 2. A Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptibility
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:50435:42"/>
of that Inſtinct, which is their Law, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are directed to that Good: 3. An Activity in them to carry them on to that Good, according to that Rule or Propenſion.</p>
                        <p>The two great Affections, that every Being is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with, is the Truth of its being, and the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it: anſwerable to thoſe are the <hi>two great Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> or Powers of the Soul; the Underſtanding, which is converſant about the former; and the Will, which is converſant about the latter. Yet in the very ſame Faculties both theſe are conjoyned under their diſtinct Notions, the Underſtanding taking into conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Truth of that which is propounded as Good, and the Will being carried with a deſire to the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Truth as Good.</p>
                        <p>Now concerning <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> it hath a <hi>three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Power:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. A <hi>Receptive or Paſſive Power,</hi> whereby it takes in thoſe Objects that are conveyed to it by an impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from without, whether it be by the ordinary and natural way of the Senſe, or by a ſupernatural im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, or by artificial means, as Speech, or Reading, or other Signs. And thus it receives not only ſimple Apprehenſions, but likewiſe Complex, or Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions Now without this receptive power, it were impoſſible for any knowledge to be in the Soul, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our Knowledge is not by Intuition, as the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Knowledge is, but by reception of the thing known, into the Soul. And hence it is plain, that all Knowledge is extrinſecal to the Soul; for though it be <hi>apta nata</hi> to receive the ſpecies or object into it, yet without ſuch reception it cannot actually know it.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. A <hi>Retentive</hi> Power of the Object or Propoſition received. Without this it were impoſſible for the Diſcurſive Power of the Underſtanding to hammer any thing out of it.</p>
                        <p n="3">
                           <pb n="46" facs="tcp:50435:43"/>3. An <hi>Active and Diſcurſive</hi> Power, whereby the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding is able to work upon thoſe Objects thus recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and retained, and deduce Concluſions and Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences from them: So that though the foundation of this intellectual Motion be from thoſe things that are impreſſed from without upon the Soul, yet when they are once there, this active and diſcurſive part of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding can draw millions of Concluſions, create millions of Mixtures, and <hi>entia rationis,</hi> which preſent not themſelves at firſt to the paſſive Underſtanding.</p>
                        <p>The Rule whereby this Active Power of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding works, is that we call <hi>Reaſon,</hi> which is but a beam of the Divine Light, a part of the Image of God in Man, and of ſingular uſe in all his Actions, if rightly uſed. <hi>De hoc infra.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now as all Receptive or Paſſive Powers are perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the receipt of the Object which may fill that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity, which is in the Power; and as all Powers are likewiſe perfected by Acts and Habits; ſo are theſe Intellectual Powers; they have their ſeveral Acts and Habits, whereby they are perfected and moved:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and this I may call of two kinds:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Paſſive</hi> Knowledge, which anſwers to the Paſſive part of the Underſtanding. Such is the Knowledge of <hi>Simple Apprehenſions,</hi> which come through the Senſes, and the Knowledge of <hi>Principles,</hi> and theſe are of two kinds:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Such as are <hi>per ſe nota,</hi> and without any Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation are ſubſcribed unto, as many Principles in the Mathematicks.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Such as are <hi>inſcribed in the Heart of Man</hi> by the Maker of Man. Thus without all queſtion at firſt, God did indite his Law in the Heart of Man; but this being not eſſential to the Soul, though he retained his Intellectual Soul; his Principles of this kind were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literated: and therefore it was the Mercy of God from
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:50435:43"/>
time to time to inculcate them into Man's Poſterity. <hi>Sed de hoc infra.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Active or Diſcurſive</hi> Knowledge. This bottoms it ſelf upon thoſe ſimple apprehenſions, that are in the Paſſive Underſtanding, and upon thoſe Principles that are in the Soul, and by purifying things from their materiality, abſtracting, riſing from the Effect to the Cauſe, and ſo downward, by the aid of that Light and Rule of Reaſon, which the God of Wiſdom hath put into the Soul, arrives to thoſe Truths, that lie in the Creature, as Gold in the Stone, beyond the reach of Senſe to acquire.</p>
                        <p>Now in this reſpect the Underſtanding of Man is of vaſt and boundleſs Capacity, and is capable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all the things in the World, and nothing that is finite can ſatisfie it. And hence it is, that it moves from one thing to another, to meet with ſomewhat that may ſatisfie the vaſt Comprehenſion of it. It is true, the higher and more noble the Object is that is known, the more delight and ſatisfaction it gives: but yet all is too ſtrait and narrow to ſatisfie it. If it could meet with an Object to which it might be united perfectly, and that were large enough to fill it, then this Faculty of the Underſtanding in this act of its Knowledge had its Happineſs, becauſe it then had found that to which it moſt naturally moves, and wherein it reſts. Now nothing can do this, but the Firſt and infinite Truth. My Underſtanding is as capable of comprehending the whole Earth, as it is of a Tennis Ball; and, could there be a means to unite the Object to my Underſtanding, were as capacious of the comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Compaſs of the Heavens, as it is of either of the former; yet when I had acquired that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, I ſhould ſtill have a vacuity, which might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend a million of Heavens more: For my Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding pares off the bulk of quantity, and the vaſteſt
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:50435:44"/>
body take up no more room in my Underſtanding than an atome. Therefore certainly I conclude that the Wiſe God, that hath put my Underſtanding into ſuch a motion, that it cannot reſt in the knowledge of the Creature, and is too comprehenſive for it, hath appointed himſelf to be the End of my Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this act or habit of Knowledge, wherein I ſhall find an Object infinitely more than anſwerable to the value, worth, and comprehenſion of my Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. This then is the End, and conſequently the Reſt and Happineſs in point of Knowledge, to know my Creator.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Wiſdom.</hi> This is nothing elſe, but ſound Reaſon; and though it reſpect the whole Man, yet it princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally reſides in the Underſtanding. This is diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied according to the different Objects, about which it is converſant, and accordingly, gives the denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Wiſe Commander, a Wiſe Stateſman, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But that which is the adequate Wiſdom of a Man, denominates him a Wiſe Man. This conſiſts in three things.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. In the diſcovery of the true and adequate <hi>End</hi> of Man. Man hath ſeveral particular Ends, to which he is ordained, though in ſeveral degrees and ſtations; and every one of theſe Ends do, and may conſiſt one with the other: but that Man, that arrives not to the Ultimate and Supream End, hath not that Wiſdom, which is commenſurate to the Nature of Man.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The diſcovery of the right <hi>Means</hi> and Rule to attain to that End. Man, as we have ſaid, hath ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Ends, and ſeveral Means there are conducible to that End. Conſervation of the <hi>Compoſitum,</hi> is an End common to Man and other Creatures; and in order to this, he hath ſeveral Means conducing to this End, as choice of his Diet, and moderation in it: Securing himſelf from Injuries, and in order to this, acquiring
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:50435:44"/>
of Riches, and Power, and Friends; Settled Societies and Commonwealths, and in order to theſe Policies, Laws, Trade, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Perpetuating of his kind by Propagation. Theſe Ends, and thoſe Means, when known, do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominate a Man Wiſe; though this Wiſdom differs in degrees, according to the ſeveral values of theſe Ends: But any, or all of theſe, do not riſe to that Wiſdom, that is the proportionable Wiſdom of a Man; becauſe theſe, as they are but temporary, and die with the Man, ſo they are but extrinſecal, and come not up to the value of the Soul. The Wiſdom anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to a Man, is that which orders him to his Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting and Spiritual End, by thoſe Means that are ſuitable to it.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The due <hi>Proſecution</hi> of this End by theſe Means. There are <hi>three great Follies</hi> in the Actions of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. In making that an End of his Actions, which in truth is not, but only a means in order to ſomething elſe: for inſtance, Riches are in truth nothing but a Means tending to our outward preſervation and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port againſt Injuries and Neceſſities; the like of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and Power; but when a Man ſhall move to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Riches, or Honour, or Power, to that end that he may be rich or great, here is a miſtake and a folly in reſting in that as the End, which in truth is nothing, nor of no value, but in order to Preſervation of it ſelf, and of that Society wherein he is, and conſequently of himſelf.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. In miſapplying Means to that End at which he drives, which though the End be right, is folly; but if the End be miſtaken, is double folly. He that makes Riches his End, if he endeavour to attain it by playing at Dice, or other unfit Means, he miſſes both his End, and Means of it.</p>
                        <p n="3">
                           <pb n="50" facs="tcp:50435:45"/>3. In Proſecution of inferiour Ends immoderately, and without ſubordination to higher Ends. The Wiſe God hath ſo ordered all things, eſpecially Man, with that order and ſubordination, that all his Ends may be proſecuted by all due Means; yet one End, Means, or Proſecution, not injurious, but rather helpful to another: and the want of diſtinction in our Ends, Means, and Proſecutions, breeds that diſorder, confuſion and folly among men in their actions and Ends. Meat and Drink is neceſſarily conducible to my preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; I may, and by the Law of Nature am bound to uſe it: Wealth and Riches are a means conducible to proviſion of thoſe ſupplies, and to the propulſion of the injuries of neceſſity and Men: Honour and Power in Civil Societies, are conducible to the ſupport and well ordering of that Society, which is my defence againſt the Injuries that I may receive from another man or men: All theſe may be uſed, and all ſo far from hindering one another in my preſervation and outward Felicity, that they are all conducible to the ſame End; and not only ſo, but may be conſiſtent with the proſecution of my high and ſupream End, and aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to me in it, when I uſe them with ſubordination to it: But without this right uſe of things to their own Ends, and with their due Subordination, all things prove unuſeful and deſtructive to it ſelf, and one to another: My eating and drinking turn to Luxury and Exceſs, and become deſtructive to me, and conſume that Wealth, which ſhould be the proviſion of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences, and my ſupport againſt Injuries: My pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of Wealth turns to Covetouſneſs and Sordidneſs, whereby I ſtraiten my ſelf in the ſupply of my own Conveniences, and lay my ſelf open to deteſtation, curſes, and envy of others; whereby it is become the means of my ruine, which well diſpenſed, might be the means of my preſervation: My Honour and Power
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:50435:45"/>
is turned into vanity and tyranny, whereby I become the envy, ſcorn, and deteſtation of that Society, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in conſiſts my outward ſafety, expoſing my ſelf to be ruined by the Society whereof I am a Member, and the Society to the ruine of others, by my improvident managing of my Power. And in this inordinate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of any of them, without the due ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of all to my ſupream End, I loſe my Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, miſerably miſpending the utmoſt and height of my Endeavours to the attaining of that, which is below me, and yet loſe the End, which may be had by them, if purſued with due ſubordination to my great End.</p>
                        <p>By what hath been premiſed, we ſee a double dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference: 1. between bare Knowledge and Wiſdom; 2. between that Wiſdom which is particular, and that which is the Supream Wiſdom.</p>
                        <p>The difference between the two former is, 1. In their Object; though every <hi>Scibile</hi> is the Object of Knowledge, it is not of Wiſdom. 2. In the Uſe; Many things are known only, that they may be known; but Wiſdom is in order to Action and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the thing known, as profitable, or from it, as hurtful; it is an act of practical Underſtanding, not purely ſpeculative.</p>
                        <p>The difference between the two latter: that which is particular Wiſdom, is but temporary, ſubſervient principally to the Body, ſubordinate, and when it wants its due ſubordination, proves irrational: but the other is perpetual, becauſe fixed upon a perpetual End, principally concerning the Soul; ſupream and ſimple without mixture of any thing in it below Reaſon.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>Conſcience.</hi> Which is a high act of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; for as Wiſdom looks and moves forward, by the right Rule or Principle, to the right End, ſo
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:50435:46"/>
Conſcience looks backward, and meaſures the acts and motions of the Soul, by theſe Rules or Principles, and conſiſts of <hi>three Propoſitions:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. It doth of neceſſity preſuppoſe a Rule or Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple given unto Man, directing him in his motion to his Supream End. We ſee all things natural have ſome Principle, Inſtinct or Law, whereby they are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to their ſeveral Ends and Operations: That which is in them an Inſtinct, was to Man a Law, becauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing indued with Underſtanding and Will, he was ſuſceptible of a Law, which inferiour Creatures were not. Now as the interruption of that Law or Rule in Natural things, brings an Obliquity and Irregularity in their motions, and ſo diverts them from that End, to which otherwiſe they would arrive; ſo <hi>the Violation</hi> of this Law or Rule given to Man, doth at once ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject him to a <hi>threefold Miſchief:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. A <hi>Loſs</hi> of that End, which the regular motion, according to that Rule, which God gave him, would have carried him unto: for the Wiſe God, having diſpoſed all things to their Ends; hath done it in, and according to thoſe ways, which he hath preſcribed them to move in to thoſe Ends.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. A <hi>Deformity and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncomelineſs</hi> contracted by the violation of that Rule. When the Creatures came out of God's hands, they were Good and Beautiful: that Beauty and Goodneſs conſiſted in nothing elſe but a Conformity to the Will of God in their Beings, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Ends: if any of that Conformity be altered, there ariſeth preſently a Deformity, uſeleſneſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comelineſs in the Creature. The ſame it is with Man: he received, queſtionleſs, a Rule to live and move to a moſt ſuitable End, and conformable to the Will of the Firſt Cauſe, that ordered him to that End: as long as he moves conformable to that Rule, he moves according to the Will of his Maker, to a moſt ſuitable End: but
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:50435:46"/>
when once he violates that Rule, he contracts a Defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, Ataxy, and Uncomelineſs by ſuch violation.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. An <hi>Obligation to ſome Poſitive Puniſhment</hi> annexed to the violation of that Law: for let us ſuppoſe any Creature, wanting Will and Underſtanding, that did notwithſtanding, not move according to this Rule, by this he would moſt clearly contract the two former, <hi>viz.</hi> Loſs and Deformity: but where a Law is given to a Creature endued with theſe Faculties, the viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Law ſo given, includes in it, not only a Privative Offence, as I may call it, to which a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative Puniſhment may be anſwerable, but a Poſitive Rebellion, Rejection, and Diſobedience to that Duty, and Subjection he owes, and is enabled to perform to his Maker: and therefore it is moſt juſt and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, that there ſhould be added, as a Sanction to that Law, ſome Poſitive Penalty to revenge ſuch a violation; that as the Obedience to that Rule, would carry a Man to a Poſitive Good, ſo the Diſobedience thereunto ſhould be followed with more than a bare privation of that Good.</p>
                        <p>This then is the firſt Propoſition, that is laid in the Underſtanding or Conſcience, this or that is Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be done or omitted, as the Rule or Law given by God, to carry me to my ſupream End and Happineſs, the violation whereof, ſubjects me to Loſs of that Happineſs, to a Deformity and Diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pance to the Will of my Maker, to the Curſe or Sanction of that Law.</p>
                        <p>Without the knowledge of this Propoſition, the great work or act of Conſcience is aſleep; therefore it is neceſſarily to be preſuppoſed, for it is the ſupream Reſolution of all Obligation in the World, both of Laws, Contracts and Oaths, as appears before. And according as this Principle is either true or falſe, clear or dubious, ſo are the actings, and concluſions of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:50435:47"/>
true or erroneous, quick or dull. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns us therefore to enquire, <hi>How theſe Principles come into the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>We find in the Creatures, ſeveral Inſtincts, inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent almoſt to every Creature, which are connatural with it: We may obſerve likewiſe in Man, diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and inclinations of ſeveral kinds, common to whole Nations, Climates, Families, which though they incline the Men to actions and carriages, ſuitable to thoſe ſeveral diſpoſitions, yet are not Laws or Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Nature.</p>
                        <p>Theſe Principles therefore of the Divine Law, called Natural Principles of Conſcience, are in the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding theſe ways:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Supernaturally.</hi> Thus Almighty God did at firſt give Man a Copy of his Will, ſhewed to his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and Will, commanded him to obey it: and this perfect diſcovery he made at firſt, and when it decayed after the Fall of Man, it is evident he did by Divine Inſpiration and Revelation, reinforce and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it, as appears by the holy Hiſtory.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Artificially,</hi> by Tradition, from the firſt Man to his Poſterity, and from one Man to another. For though the firſt Man loſt much of his Light and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, by the Fall, yet he was not without divers of thoſe Principles, which God at firſt ſhewed him.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Naturally; <hi>viz.</hi> by the help of Reaſon and Diſcourſe; for although if a Man were bred up from his Infancy without any manner of Inſtructions, it would be very difficult for him to take up of himſelf any ſound Principles of Nature, yet I do believe that the Divine Law given to Man, hath that Juſtice and agreeableneſs to right Reaſon, that when once the motions of Reaſon had any materials of Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to work upon, it would incline ſuch a Man, though weakly, to ſome, though not all of thoſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:50435:47"/>
Laws, which were firſt perfectly written in the Heart of the firſt Man. The Precepts of the Divine Law, though they be not congenite with us, yet many of them are ſo rational, and hold ſuch a conformity with right Reaſon, that Reaſon exerciſed, would light upon ſome of them. Hence ſeveral Nations, that we know not ever to have had correſpondence one with another, yet agree in many Natural Obſervations and Cuſtoms, as agreeing to the common Reaſon of both, and the Wiſe God having ſo ordered the Buſineſs of this World, that thoſe Laws, which he gave to Man, beſt and moſt rationally conduce to his Good here, as well as hereafter, as is moſt evident in the Precepts of the Firſt and ſecond Tables. Thus much for the firſt Propoſition of Conſcience.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 The ſecond or Minor Propoſition of Conſcience, is the ſtating of what I have done, whether in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity or Violation of that Law, which is nothing but a Reflex act of the Soul, looking into the Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual Memory, and impartially ſtating what I have done. And by this a Man may ſee that the Divine Law doth not look at all upon the outward act, as the violation or performance of it, but ſo far ſorth only, as it is an effect of the Soul and Will. And hence it is, that the judgment of the Conſcience looks upon the work within. It is true when the act of the Will is full and compleat, it is teſtified by the outward action, but it is not the outward action that makes the violation or performance. This then is the ſecond Propoſition or Aſſumption, This or that I have done or omitted.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The third Propoſition is the Concluſion, either of acquittal or condemnation, of obligation to that Guilt, which ariſeth upon the breach of that Law, Loſs of my End, Deformity, and liableneſs to the Curſe.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="56" facs="tcp:50435:48"/>Thus far concerning the Underſtanding, and the Acts of it, the ſecond great Faculty is <hi>the Will,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Soul is moved to the Deſire and Proſecution of that which is Good. It is true, that all Powers carry with them a Natural Appetite or Motion to that which is the Object of that Power, and conſequently comes under the Name and Notion of Good: the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding naturally moves to know its Object, as to a Good ſuitable to that Power: the Senſes move to their Objects; the Eye is not ſatisfied with Seeing, nor the Ear with Hearing: the Natural Appetite moves to the enjoyment of ſuch a Good, as may fill and anſwer the want or exigence of the thing that hath that Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite. But the <hi>difference</hi> between the Motions of the Will and other Faculties, is conſiderable in two things:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. In <hi>the object.</hi> Generally the Object of the Will is Good: and this diſtinguiſheth it from the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, whoſe Object is Truth: ſo that though the ſame thing is the Object of both, yet thoſe Faculties faſten upon it under ſeveral Notions, as the ſame body may be the object of my Eye as coloured, and of my Touch as hard: and though Good and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is an Object of my Underſtanding, as a <hi>Scibile,</hi> whereby my Underſtanding examines the Truth, the Nature, the Circumſtances, the Degrees, the Suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of it; yet it is an Object of my Will, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petible or deſirable, which is nothing elſe, but the motion of the Soul to Union with that it concludes to be Good, and ſuch a Good hath theſe <hi>Qualities:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. It muſt be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> 
                           <hi>Poſſible</hi> Good: and this hath a double Reaſon: 1. Becauſe this is an Inclination put into the Soul by the Wiſe Maker of the Soul, who never did any thing in vain; and therefore never put any motion in any thing, to ſuch a thing which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attainable <hi>ex natura rei:</hi> It is true <hi>de facto</hi> it may fall out that Good to which the Soul is moved, may not
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:50435:48"/>
be attained by reaſon of ſome extrinſecal interveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and yet <hi>ex natura rei</hi> the Good may be attainable. 2. Becauſe the Will is a Rational Faculty, and though of it ſelf, it moves indeterminately to all Good, yet when it moves to any determinate Object, it moves upon the predeciſion of the rational Underſtanding: Now it were a mere irrational act to move, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible thing that it ſhould move to that which the Underſtanding doth not in ſome ſort conclude poſſible to attain: for the end of Deſire is union to the thing deſired; and were there not a Poſſibility of Union concluded in the Underſtanding, there would be an impoſſibility to will it, or move after it.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. It muſt be a <hi>Suitable Good</hi> to the Exigence, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Condition of the Subject that deſires it: 1. To the Exigence of the Subject: And this is evident in all motions of all things: they move to that which is apt to fill up and ſupply that vacuity, which is in the thing deſiring it, even in natural, as well as rational Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites: the Hungry Man his Appetite is not for Clothes, but Food. 2. According to the Condition of the Subject: A Senſitive Appetite moves to a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Good; and a Rational, to a Rational Good; and an Immortal, to an Immortal Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Man conſiſts of ſeveral Pieces, and therefore hath ſeveral Exigences and Conditions, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moves to ſeveral Ends anſwerable thereunto, and the Will is carried to thoſe Ends: yet when the Will is rationally and regularly moved, it moves to the Inferiour Ends or Good, with ſubordination to that whch <hi>is</hi> the Greateſt Good, and therefore reſts not in them, nor is ſatisfied with them: Nay, though by reaſon of Ignorance or other Accident it miſtake, or know not, or forget its Supream End, it takes no full Satisfaction in thoſe Inferiour Goods: Though it know not what to deſire, yet in all the Enjoyments
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:50435:49"/>
of theſe inferiour Deſires, it finds that it hath not what it ſhould, and that breeds diſcontent, wearineſs, and changeable purſuits of empty and unſatisfying pleaſures and profits, and contentments.</p>
                        <p>Now the Will is carried to its Object, by a double <hi>Principle</hi> of Motion:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Original: That Great and Wiſe God, that hath put in all things, Inclinations to their ſeveral Ends, hath put this will in Man, to move to his End: wherein he hath at once fulfilled his own Will; He did it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it pleaſed him; and led Man to his Happineſs; for this we may moſt clearly ſee in the Frame of all things; His Wiſdom and his Goodneſs is ſuch, that the Duty and the Happineſs of his Creature, are never ſevered; When the Creature moves to the fulfilling of his Maker's Will, he moves in the ſame act to his own Perfection and Happineſs.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Immediate: The Underſtanding is the Seat where God hath ſet his Light, the Light of Reaſon: the Deciſion or Determination of Reaſon is, or ſhould be, the Guide of our Will: Now <hi>the Determination of Reaſon</hi> and <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding</hi> is <hi>twofold:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>General,</hi> That whatſoever tends to the Good of the Subject, is to be deſired and proſecuted, and that according to the ſeveral degrees of that Good, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ought the deſire and proſecution to be: if there be two Goods propounded, the one more perfect, univerſal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> than the other, then though both may be purſued, yet <hi>this</hi> with ſubordination to <hi>that.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Special,</hi> Specificating and determining this or that to be Good, and giving the degrees thereof, which is or ſhould be the meaſure of the motion of the Will. This is the laſt act of the Practical Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding: For though all Good be the Object of the Will in its Latitude, yet the Will faſtens particularly upon that Good, which by the Underſtanding is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:50435:49"/>
to be his Chiefeſt Good: and in order to the Union unto this Good, is the Motion of the Will; and ſubſervient to this Motion, are the ſeveral Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Affections of the Soul, which are but the impreſſions of the actions of the Will upon the Blood and Spirits, whereby the Will exciteth and produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth thoſe external actions in the body, which tend to the execution of its commands, and therefore I omit them.</p>
                        <p>Upon what hath been ſaid, may appear, wherein lies <hi>the immediate Cauſe of Man's miſcarriage</hi> to his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream End: It lies in the Defects of his Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and his Will.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. For his <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding:</hi> If this hath either no Light, or a falſe Light, the Will is miſguided: The Soul of Man will be moving to ſome thing or other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the notion of Good; this ſets the Underſtanding a work, which, if not rightly Principled, takes up that for his Good, which either the temper and conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the body and fleſhly appetite, or the preſent opportunity ſuggeſts and affects, and puts the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Will upon it; as Pleaſures, or Profits, or Honours, or empty Speculations: and yet in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of theſe a Man (that hath almoſt any Intellectuals, though it may be he arrive not to the true and poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Knowledge of what is his Supream End) moſt commonly finds, that this is not; and though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he knows not why, yet he is ſick and weary of them, as unſatisfying and deceiving things; wheraas the true cauſe is that diſproportion they bear to the nature of the Soul, and are not that End, to which it is ordained and would move, if it knew it, and how to attain it. Again, though the Underſtanding doth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times find, that theſe are not the things will make me happy, but I ſpy the true and Everlaſting Happineſs, yet the Conviction is not ſo ſtrong and evident, that
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:50435:50"/>
it dares conclude the purſuit thereof to be preferred before the preſent Enjoyment of thoſe delights, which we are ſure of: and from hence it comes to paſs, that the competition of theſe preſent Enjoyments will ſoon ſtarve and famiſh theſe uncompleat Convictions, and all purſuits in the Will of them. Theſe and the like defects happen in the Underſtanding.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. In <hi>the Will,</hi> which hath loſt her Liberty to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low her Light, and is captivated by the Senſual Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite. The Underſtanding, being rightly inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, preſents to the Will ſeveral Ends; the Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Ends, Preſervation of the <hi>Compoſitum</hi> by Meat and Drink, acquiſition of Wealth, to provide theſe Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences, obtaining of Power to ſecure that Wealth; the Supream End, Bleſſedneſs, and that wherein it conſiſts; ſhews the Will, that the Value of theſe Ends muſt be the meaſure of her purſuit of them, <hi>viz.</hi> with ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination to the Supream End in order to it, and bids her beware of turning the Subordinate Ends to Ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Ends: But the Senſual Appetite, either before the Counſel of the Underſtanding, hath precipitated the Will into a violent purſuit of thoſe preſent and ſenſible Goods, or ſo bewitched her after in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment thereof, that it can no more liſten to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment of the purſuit of a future Spiritual Good, than if it had no Reaſon: the Beaſt in Man hath got the Man upon his Back, and runs away with him, contrary to the cries and dictates even of Reaſon that ſhould rule it. And of theſe and the like defects, all Mankind is ſick, both in his Underſtanding and Will, and cured we muſt be, before we can clearly and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly move to <hi>our Supream End,</hi> which, what it is, as the next Inquiry.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of the Supream End of Man.</head>
                        <p>
                           <hi>WHAT is that Good for the Sons of Men?</hi> as it was the greateſt Inquiry of the Wiſeſt of Men, ſo it is that Problem that hath tortured the Wits, and wearied the purſuits of moſt of the Children of Men, that have been in the World. The univerſality of the queſtion grows from that reſtleſs motion in the Soul of Man after ſome End, which puts every Man at laſt, upon the proſecution of ſomewhat as his End, though it may be not upon the ſpeculative and critical inquiry concerning it. As the ordinary rational faculty of the Soul, teacheth a Man to conclude rationally, though he have not that artificial Reaſon of Reaſon, which is acquired by ſpeculation and ſtudy. And as this is the cauſe that puts many upon the Inquiry, and all upon the Proſecution of ſome End, ſo the difficulty of the Deciſion doth produce that variety of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Practice concerning this, which are impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible all to be ſound and true, but poſſibly they may be all falſe, in as much as there can be but one Supream Good and adequate End of Man, which is his Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. And from hence it is, that amongſt the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral determinations of Men concerning this matter, each do abundantly convince the other, to be errors and miſtakes, and though none do ſufficiently ſatisfie and convince a Man, that it is the right, yet doth abundantly ſatisfie, that the adverſe Opinion is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken concerning this Point, becauſe the Truth is but one, the reſt are all Errors; and though ſome carry more likelihood of Reaſon than others, yet it carries
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:50435:51"/>
ſo much diſtance from Truth, that it is diſcernable not to be the Truth, and the miſtake is not only evident to Reaſon, but even to Senſe it ſelf. That Man that would go about to perſwade me, that Happineſs conſiſts in Corporal Pleaſures, outward good of Body or Fortune, Wealth or Honours, Knowledge of all created Beings, practice of Moral Virtues, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I need no other conviction of the falſity of theſe, but this, That in the midſt of any, or all of theſe, I ſtill find thoſe affections in my Soul, that cannot conſiſt with Happineſs, but mingles Miſery with this thin and empty Happineſs:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Deſire of ſomewhat more, or ſomewhat elſe, which I have not, which ariſeth not from the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of what I enjoy, but from the Emptineſs and Narrowneſs of it.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Conſequently Grief for what I want, and have not.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Fear of Loſs of what I have.</p>
                        <p>And never any Man in this World, in all the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments he ever had, or was capable of, except that which we now intend to ſpeak of, but in the midſt of all, had theſe three Affections about him, actually working, which can never conſiſt with Happineſs.</p>
                        <p>Now the general Grounds of theſe miſtakes in the practice of Men is, 1. The Error of their Judgment, 2. The <hi>Impetus</hi> or force of the Senſual Appetite, which precipitates and captivates their Judgment. The Speculative Error ariſeth from Ignorance,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Of the Subject, Man; for let it be but once granted, that the Soul of Man is an Intellectual Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Subſtance, all thoſe Opinions, which place Happineſs in this Life, will be convinced clearly falſe and vain. But though the Knowledge of this be ſufficient to tell me what is not my Happineſs, <hi>viz.</hi> That no temporal thing, no carnal pleaſure, no
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:50435:51"/>
contemplation of the Creature is commenſurate to the Nature and duration of the Soul, which is the beſt part of Man, and conſequently is not, nor can be his End. Yet this, though <hi>it</hi> take him off from the wrong ways, it ſets him not in the right way, but leaves him at a ſtand. Therefore</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The ſecond Impediment, is the Ignorance of the Object of this Happineſs, the want of the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, which is the only Object of all our Happineſs: the proof and demonſtration whereof, enſues.</p>
                        <p>By what hath been before ſaid, it is evident,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That by the Wiſe appointment of God, every thing is ordained to an End, to which it moves.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That this End is ſuch a Good, as is anſwerable to the perfection of the Creature, which moves to it: a meer Natural Agent moves to a Natural End, a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive, to a Senſible Good.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. That the higheſt Perfection of the reaſonable Creature, conſiſts in his reaſonable Soul, by which he is a large degree above the Senſitives.</p>
                        <p>Therefore to find out, <hi>Wherein that Good conſiſts, that is the End of Man,</hi> we muſt take meaſure of the Soul, wherein conſiſts Man's Perfection; and When or Where we can find a Good commenſurate to the Soul, there, and there only can we fix Man's Happineſs.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The Soul of Man is <hi>Immaterial,</hi> and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that wherein conſiſts Happineſs, cannot be Material. This takes off all Senſible Objects, as Pleaſures, Wealth, Outward Pomp, nay, all the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Creatures, from being the Object of Man's Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. It is as impoſſible to ſatisfie a Spirit with theſe things, as it is to feed a Body with a Spirit: they hold not a proportion or conformity one to another. And from hence it is, that in that ſmall ſlender uſe that the Soul makes of the Creature, as it cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:50435:52"/>
into the Soul, till it be ſpiritualized in the <hi>ſpecies,</hi> which are refined more and more the nearer they come to the Soul, firſt in the Organ, then in the Phantaſie, ſo neither can the Soul make uſe of them to any purpoſe, being received, till by abſtraction it hath made them of the ſame nature with her ſelf. And from this diſproportion between the Soul and thoſe external Enjoyments, do ariſe that Unſatisfactorineſs, that comes by them to the Soul: for though they are uſeful to the Body and the outward Man, and therefore they are deſirable by the Soul it ſelf, in order to that End, yet they reach not ſo far as the Soul, their End falls ſhort of it; and hence it is, that the Soul reſts not in the enjoyment of them, nay, though it ſee not its proper End, yet it finds a <hi>nauſeum</hi> in the exceſs of theſe, and therefore is reſtleſs, and moves from one Pleaſure to another. And this is likewiſe the reaſon, why every outward Pleaſure is greater in the Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than in the Fruition, becauſe the Imagination of the Soul, which is the Creature that the Soul forms, can bring it nearer to the Soul than the Creature, when it is enjoyed, can come: and this Imagination, as it doth delude the Soul, ſo it likewiſe takes off much of that Content which may be lawfully found and uſed in the Creature; it makes the Purſuit too eager, and Fruition flat, in that it was over expected.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The Soul of Man is conſequently <hi>Immortal,</hi> and its Felicity cannot therefore conſiſt in that which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be co-extended with it. Were there a Good imaginable, that in its own nature, held proportion with the value of the Soul, and yet were periſhable, it were impoſſible, that in the enjoyment of this Good, could the Felicity of the Soul conſiſt: and that upon theſe Reaſons,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Becauſe the Duration of the Soul, is not diviſible and ſucceſſive, taking it apart from the Body: A tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:50435:52"/>
Felicity would be no Felicity. It is true, we meaſure out our time by parcels, as years, and weeks, and days, and hours, and minutes, but the Soul doth not ſo; for though the duration thereof is not ſimply indiviſible, as in the Duration of Eternity, yet it is far more ſwift than ours, and ſo would be almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible of a temporary Good, though of long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Becauſe the determination of that Good, would conſequently determine its Felicity, ſo it can be no perfect Happineſs.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The very enjoyment of a moſt perfect Good, that the Soul looks upon as determinable, is in that very enjoyment mingled with a diſcontent, grief, and fear, which are abundantly ſufficient to rob the Soul of Felicity in that very enjoyment, when the Soul ſhall be taken up with ſuch ſad preapprehenſions and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectations as theſe:
<q>I now enjoy a good anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to my deſires, and that fills up every the leaſt vacuity and craving of my Will; yet I foreſee that it is not laſting, a time muſt come when I muſt loſe it, and it will die under my hand, and yet my Immortal Being ſhall have continuance to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, when my preſent Enjoyment ſhall ſerve but to increaſe my emptineſs and miſery with the ſenſe of what I had, and loſt.</q>
This Hand-writing upon the Wall, is enough to turn the higheſt Enjoyment, that is but temporary, into bitterneſs in the very enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, much more thoſe vain and thin Pleaſures of this World, that never came near the Soul, but in a deceitful Imagination. So then to the conſtitution of true Happineſs for an immortal Subſtance, there is re-required an immortal Good.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. It muſt be a Good <hi>divided in its own Nature from the Soul.</hi> There can nothing be the End and Supream Good to it ſelf, but the Firſt Cauſe, which alone is
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:50435:53"/>
ſelf-ſufficient: And that is manifeſt in the Motions of the Soul; for if it ſelf were the End of it ſelf, it hath its End, and conſequently, would ceaſe to move; but it is evident, that the Soul is not a Pure Act, but receptive of ſomething diſtinct from it ſelf, to which it moves, as to its End and Perfection.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. It muſt be a <hi>True and Real Good:</hi> for ſince the Perfection of the Soul, conſiſts in theſe two active Faculties, the Underſtanding, whoſe Object is Truth, and the Will; and the principal uſe of every Faculty, is in order to the Supream End of the Soul, which is his <hi>Summum Bonum;</hi> it is neceſſary, that <hi>that</hi> which <hi>is</hi> purſued by the Will, as Good, ſhould likewiſe be entertained by the Underſtanding, as True; and the higheſt Perfection of the Underſtanding, <hi>is</hi> about the Truth of that which is the Supream Good; becauſe that Truth is the Supream Truth. The Truth of this Goodneſs ſtands in oppoſition, 1 to that which ſeems to be Good, and is not at all; ſuch are meerly ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary and phantaſtical Goods, when the Soul works an imaginary Good, and then works it ſelf into the belief of it: 2. to that, which having a being, ſeems to be good, and is not: 3. to that, which though it be good, ſeems to be the Supream Good, but is not. It muſt therefore be an Intellectual Real Good.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. It muſt be an <hi>Infinite and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal</hi> Good. The former qualifications, though each exclude ſomething, yet none excludes all Creatures from being the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream End of the Soul: Angels and Spirits are Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material, Immortal, Intellectual Good, yet they want this one qualification, without which it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that there can be the Object, wherein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts true Happineſs. The reaſon is this, becauſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing below an Infinite Good, can ſatisfie the infinite motion of the Soul. The motion and comprehenſion of the Underſtanding, though actually, it doth not
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:50435:53"/>
underſtand all things finite, it may comprehend all finite things in the World: which is clearly evidenced by Experience: the moſt knowing Man in the World hath as much room for more Knowledge, as he had before he knew any thing: if a Man therefore knew all the finite things in the World, yet were not the Underſtanding ſo filled; but were there more to be known, he would have room for it, and conſequently a deſire to it: Nothing then can fill and ſatiate the Underſtanding, but Infiniteneſs: yet we are not therefore to conclude, that the Underſtanding is commenſurate to the infinite nature of the Firſt Being: no, that hath an actual Plenitude beyond the comprehenſion of the Underſtanding: but the meaning is, God hath placed in the Soul of Man an Underſtanding potentially infinite, that cannot be filled with what is actually finite, as all Creatures are. And as the Motion of the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is infinite and reſtleſs, till it be filled with him that fills all in all, ſo is the Motion of the Will, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing below an infinite Good can ſatisfie it. And now, as we have argued upward from the Capacity and Vaſtneſs of the Soul and its Faculties, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing below an infinite Good can be its End, ſo we muſt argue downward too; The Great and Wiſe Creator, who hath the diſpoſition of all things to their Ends, and who in his Infinite Wiſdom, hath put mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and capacities in all things, conducing and fit for thoſe Ends, for which he hath ordained them, hath appointed himſelf to be the End of his Immortal Creature, and therefore hath put in the Soul, a Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city too large for any thing below himſelf, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions reſtleſs in any thing, but himſelf. The <hi>Concluſion</hi> therefore is, the Immortal Inviſible Creator of all things, that is infinite in Goodneſs and Truth, hath been pleaſed to appoint himſelf to be <hi>the End of Man,</hi> wherein conſiſts his Supream Good.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="68" facs="tcp:50435:54"/>But it may be here conſiderable, <hi>How God can be the adequate Object of Man's Felicity, ſeeing Man conſiſts of a Soul and Body united, which was ordained to an End of Happineſs as well as the Soul?</hi> To omit the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Reſurrection, <hi>de qua infra,</hi> I do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that God is the adequate Object of Man's Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, in reſpect of his <hi>Compoſitum,</hi> as well as ſingly of his Soul, though in a different way of Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: The Communication of himſelf to the Soul, is more immediate and ſublime: the Communication to the Body and <hi>Compoſitum,</hi> mediate by Second Cauſes, enabling and bleſſing their operations. And I cannot queſtion, but in the firſt Creation, when the Soul en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed God as the Object of her Happineſs, the whole <hi>Compoſitum</hi> did partake of that influence in communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of Happineſs anſwerable to every exigence and degree of its being. <hi>Sed de hoc infra.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now in as much as the Firſt Cauſe, is the laſt End of Man, and the only Object of his Happineſs, it remains to be inquired <hi>what this Happineſs is,</hi> or <hi>the Formal Reaſon of it:</hi> for it is poſſible, that there may be a Subject capable of Happineſs, and a Being that may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to that Capacity, yet the Subject not truly happy. <hi>The Beatitude</hi> therefore <hi>of the Soul</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of the Soul unto this Object</hi> of his Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs: and this Union preſuppoſeth a <hi>double act:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. An act or <hi>Propenſion in the Soul,</hi> moving it unto God, as to its End and Perfection: and as the Great Creator did appoint himſelf to be the End of this his rational Creature, ſo he implanted in him a Propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Motion in him to that End; and that Propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Motion is not a meer natural Inclination, but ariſeth from the fitneſs of thoſe high Faculties of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and Will for ſo excellent an Object. In theſe he hath placed a Capacity or Receptibility in ſome meaſure of himſelf: and as every Power is ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:50435:54"/>
in reference to ſomething elſe, that may actuate and perfect it, and conſequently moves after that Object whereunto it is ordained, ſo this Receptibility, which God hath placed in the Soul, doth, or at leaſt naturally ſhould, move to that Object, which alone can fill its vacuities and receptiveneſs.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. In as much as God is a Free Agent, though he gave the Soul theſe Faculties, yet ſo much is his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Perfection beyond the reach and attainment of any finite Being, <hi>that</hi> this Motion of the Soul can never overtake his Happineſs, unleſs there be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>an act of Condeſcenſion and Communion</hi> of himſelf to the Soul: therefore there is neceſſarily required to the Happineſs of the Soul a Communication by God unto the Soul: And by this reciprocal act, 1. of the Soul to God, as the only perfection of it, 2. of God to the Soul, filling the deſires thereof with himſelf, this Union and Happineſs is wrought. This Communication by God, is not of his Eſſence or Being, for that is incommunicable, and cannot be mingled with any Creature, but as objective; and for a fuller expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this, God is pleaſed to communicate himſelf to the Soul, according to the nature of theſe great Faculties, which he hath planted in it, <hi>viz.</hi> the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and the Will. And as without relation to both theſe, it is impoſſible that Man ſhould be truly happy; ſo if both theſe be fully ſatisfied, there cannot want any thing to compleat his Happineſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no other Faculty in the Soul, which can receive any further portion of Happineſs.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The <hi>Communication of God to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> is that whereby he fills the ſame with the Knowledge and ſight of himſelf. Here the Underſtanding hath an object that ſatisfies and fills all the reſtleſs motions of it, wherein he reads the ſatisfaction of all his doubts and inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, wherein, though upon the firſt view, it finds more

Every Power, in the enjoyment of its full and adequate Object, hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency and acquieſcence; which nevertheleſs is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but a circular and reciprocal motion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Object and the Power: the Power is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with a full deſire to the Object, the Object being enjoyed, returns it ſelf adequately to the deſire, and this is ſo ſwift and imperceptible a motion, that it is called the Reſt of that Power. Thus it is with the Underſtanding, when it hath attained the knowledge of ſome excellent Art or Object below; It is true, this breeds ſome delight, but becauſe the Object that is known, is not adequate to the extent of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, it returns not an anſwerable return to the Underſtanding; and therefore, though it take ſome delight in it, yet it is but faint and weak, but at ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, it reſts not in it, but moves to ſomething elſe: but this Object is more than adequate to the largeſt Underſtanding, and therefore when the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is filled with it, it cannot chooſe but reſt in it with the moſt abſolute complacence and delight, that that Power is capable of.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. But though the Underſtanding were able to read all the Infinite Perfections of God, yet if that other Great Faculty be not ſatisfied, as it is impoſſible the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:50435:55"/>
Soul ſhould be compleatly happy, ſo it is poſſible, it may be extreamly miſerable, if whiles the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding contemplated the Greatneſs, Power, and Goodneſs of God, the Soul ſhould not partake of it, but that Power ingage againſt it: Therefore the ſecond part of the Happineſs of the Soul, is the <hi>Communication of the Goodneſs of God</hi> to the Soul, whereof it is capable, and <hi>which the Will deſires,</hi> by letting in upon the Soul the beams and light of his Love, his favour, his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation, his delight in the Soul, whereby as the Soul moſt eagerly moves to him as his Chiefeſt Good, ſo it pleaſeth him to entertain thoſe motions, and fills them with enjoyment of himſelf, and the ſight and ſenſe of his love to it. This Union of God to his Creature, either in filling it with his Knowledge or his Goodneſs, we are not able to diſcover, only herein conſiſts Man's Happineſs, when his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is filled with his Maker's Light, and his Will with his Love; which creates a kind of mutual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety between God and the Soul: <hi>I will be their God, and they ſhall be my People.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now though this may be the Happineſs of the Soul ſeparated, but how can this be ſaid to be the Happineſs of Man, which conſiſting of a Body and inferiour Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties ſubſervient thereunto, and to his ſubſiſtence as a Man? or whether, and how can this Happineſs be acquired or enjoyed by Man in this life, ſince his Soul now acts and moves organically, and according to the temper and accommodations of the Body, and ſo is not capable of that clear and undiſturbed Knowledge of God, or ſenſe of his Love? and if it were, how could that accommodate the neceſſities of his outward Man?</p>
                        <p>Theſe things are to be conſidered to anſwer this Queſtion:</p>
                        <p n="1">
                           <pb n="72" facs="tcp:50435:56"/>1. What are the Degrees of Happineſs, attainable by the Soul in this life? and wherein it conſiſts?</p>
                        <p n="2">2 What Happineſs is attainable for the whole <hi>Compoſitum</hi> or Frame of Man in this Life, and wherein it conſiſts?</p>
                        <p>Touching the former, we ſay:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. There is not the ſame degree of Happineſs to be expected for the Soul in this Life, as there is when either it is freed from the Body, or the Body freed from thoſe imperfections of mixt Body Which we carry about us. The reaſon is evident in both the great Faculties: in that of the Underſtanding, it works now by Organs and Inſtruments of the Body, and is ſtraitened in its operations, according to the condition of thoſe Organs and Inſtruments; it ſees now with the Eyes of the Body, though it works out of that ſight higher concluſions, and if it had, as once it had, a more clear and immediate Viſion of God, yet it could not be ſo capacious within the limits of the Body, as when the Soul were meerly ſpiritual, or the Body ſpiritualized. Again, as to the Will, it cannot exerciſe the utmoſt of his activity in the Love of God, becauſe the neceſſity of the humane condition requires ſome of its thought, proviſions, and motions: neither can it be ſo receptive of that infinite Love and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, being confined and ſtraitened with a corruptible Body, as if it were at large.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That the Wiſe God did provide a proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able degree of Happineſs to the Soul in this Life; and this upon the reaſons already given. Now in as much as the actings of the Soul in the Body are more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compleat and imperfect, that Happineſs that was ſo ordained for it, though it were fully proportionable to the perfection of the actings of the Soul here, yet it was not ſo perfect as that Conſummate Happineſs, which was provided for it hereafter; it was perfectly
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:50435:56"/>
proportionable to the condition of the Soul as it was in the Body, though not proportionable to that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment which the Soul might have, when freed from the ſtraitneſs of the Body; and as the Happineſs of the Soul in the Body, was inferiour to the Happineſs of the Soul ſeparate, ſo queſtionleſs, as the Soul in the Body receives improvements and abatements in its actings in the Body by the conjunction with it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the variety of the temper, frame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of the Body, ſo the preſent enjoyment of Happineſs in the Soul might be more or leſs, if Man had continued in his perfection; a Child had not had the ſame meaſure of internal Happineſs as a Man bad, for though the ſubſtance of the Soul were the ſame, its operations in the Body were diverſified in their perfections, according to the variety of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Body, which naturally the Soul exerciſeth in its operations.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. That though <hi>ex natura rei,</hi> Man was ordained to temporal Happineſs in his Soul, yet it is evident, that ſomewhat hath intervened, and daily doth intervene, whereby that Fruition is diverted and diſturbed, what ever it be. Of this more <hi>infra.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>higheſt degree of Happineſs of the Soul in this Life,</hi> conſiſts in theſe things:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. In an Anticipation, or Expectation, or <hi>Previſion of that Happineſs,</hi> which it ſhall enjoy: This, though it be not a real Fruition, yet it is very near it in the Soul: if a miſerable Pilgrim ſhould have a certain aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, that after twenty years walk, he ſhould be ſure to be inveſted in a perpetual Kingdom, wherein he ſhould have perfection of Eaſe and Delight, this Previſion of this Happineſs is ſo preſent in his Soul, that it is in effect, preſently enjoyed, and over-weighs the preſent tediouſneſs of his Journey.</p>
                        <p n="2">
                           <pb n="74" facs="tcp:50435:57"/>2. In a <hi>Conjunction of the Soul to God</hi> in Knowledge of him, Love unto him, and return of his Love to us, in a meaſure proportionable to the capacity of our Underſtanding and Will. This, though it be not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, but admits of increaſes, yet <hi>ex natura rei</hi> may be proportionable to the moſt perfect operations of our Soul in the Body, and doth as far exceed all other Happineſs in the World, as far as it falls ſhort of that perfect Knowledge, Love, and ſenſe of the Love of God, which ſhall be enjoyed hereafter. Were a Man from the higheſt Honour and Reputation in the World, caſt into the greateſt Scorn and Ignominy, that the moſt exact and exaſperated Envy could impoſe or wiſh; or were his Body laden with as many Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, Miſeries, and Torments, as Hunger, and the moſt ſublimated and ingenious Malice could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict or contrive; could as well the higheſt ſenſe, as the moſt imminent expectation of Death, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of Evils, be felt, and yet protracted for an age; yet if under all this, the Soul can look upon theſe Miſeries as ſuch as muſt end, and ſee, though at a diſtance, a Fruition of an Everlaſting Beatitude, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly expecting upon the cloſe of theſe Miſeries, the Expected Happineſs is made Preſent by Faith, and over-ballanceth the Preſent, but Ending Miſery: How much more when in the inſtant of theſe Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, the intention and bent of the Soul is to her Maker, and the Great God ſhall by the ſecret, yet real, beams of his Favour ſend into the Soul Meſſages of Acceptation and Love? How ſmall and low doth this render the higheſt Contempts and Malice of Men and Devils! and how much rather would this Man chooſe to enjoy theſe effects of the Love of his Maker with theſe Miſeries, than barely to ſee the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his Power and Juſtice in removing or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging them!</p>
                        <p n="2">
                           <pb n="75" facs="tcp:50435:57"/>2 How far forth this Union of the Soul to God, doth conduce <hi>to the Happineſs of the Compoſitum,</hi> the Whole Man? or Whether it doth ſo or no? Wherein we ſay:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That the Happineſs that is anſwerable to the <hi>Compoſitum,</hi> without conſidering the great relation of the soul, doth conſiſt in the perfecting and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his ſubſiſtence and kind; and whatſoever the <hi>Compoſitum</hi> deſires and moves after, it is in order to theſe, and not otherwiſe, as in that one inſtance of Meats, the Wiſe God hath given him the Senſe of Taſting, whereby he takes delight in thoſe things that pleaſe the Appetite, but this is in order to the taking in of thoſe Nouriſhments that may preſerve the <hi>Compoſitum;</hi> the like of the other Senſes. Now as long as the Man in theſe things moves to theſe Ends, he moves naturally and orderly; but when in ſtead of moving to this End, he reſts in the Means, then he moves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinately, and out of the way to that temporal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, the ſupport of the Body, as when he eats and drinks to exceſs; the like for all other outward mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as Honours, Riches, Women, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When they are not enjoyed to thoſe Ends, for which they are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, then is the Man out of that way to the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Happineſs of the <hi>Compoſitum, viz.</hi> the due Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and Subſiſtence of it.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That the Felicity of the Soul may conſiſt with this Felicity of the <hi>Compoſitum ex natura rei.</hi> The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <hi>à priori</hi> hath been already given, becauſe the Wiſe God in the firſt Inſtitution of things, did order every thing to their ſeveral Ends with that Wiſdom, that there was no claſhing of the ſeveral Ends of the ſame thing, or of ſeveral things, but one did and might Conſiſt with the other; the Felicity of the Soul might, and <hi>ex natura rei</hi> may conſiſt with the Happineſs of the Body and <hi>Compoſitum.</hi> Therefore it follows:</p>
                        <p n="3">
                           <pb n="76" facs="tcp:50435:58"/>3. That Inconſiſtency of the Happineſs of the Soul with that of the Body is not real: but becauſe, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it comes to paſs, we have miſplaced and miſtaken the Happineſs of the Body, we now place the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Body in turning our ſelves over to Senſuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in exceſſive uſing of the Creatures, in exceſſive Luſts. Theſe are clear miſtakes, for it is moſt apparent, that theſe are enemies to the very ſubſiſtence of the Body and <hi>Compoſium.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. That this Felicity of the Body, is inferiour to the Felicity of the Soul; and therefore if <hi>ex accidente</hi> it falls out, though it ſeldom doth in truth, that the temporal Felicity of the Body is <hi>in hoc individuo</hi> incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with that of the Soul, right Reaſon tells us that the greater End, and that of more concernment is to be preferred; ſo that as there is, and ought to be a ſubordination of thoſe Faculties and Powers placed in the Body, to thoſe Ends for which they were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted, <hi>viz.</hi> the preſervation of the <hi>Compoſitum,</hi> ſo there ought to be a ſubordination, both of theſe Means, and that End to the Great End, the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Soul.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. As the Great End of Man doth conſiſt with the Happineſs of his Body or <hi>Compoſitum,</hi> ſo it doth much and effectually conduce to it. And as this is apparent in the original creation of Man, when the Happineſs of his Mind by the Knowledge and Preſence of his Maker was accompanied with the Felicity of his <hi>Compoſitum;</hi> and as it was likewiſe apparent in his Fall, as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted Miſery in the one, ſo he did in the other; ſo it is moſt rationally evident in the preſent ſtate and condition of Mankind, as will be evident in conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of theſe enſuing particulars:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. It ſhews a Man the right uſe of the Creature, <hi>viz.</hi> to be ſubſervient, and in order to the preſervation of the <hi>Compoſitum.</hi> The want of a true and rational
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:50435:58"/>
uſe of ſecular matters is a great cauſe of the great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs of Man, as when he deſires Riches, becauſe he would be rich, or Honours, becauſe he would be great, or delicate Fare, becauſe he would eat. Now when Men miſtake the uſe of things, reſting in that as an End, which is only uſeful to ſomething elſe, this breeds theſe diſorders in, and among men, which doth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb even their outward Peace and Happineſs: This is regulated, when the Heart is ſet upon the Love of God, it takes off any inordinate Love to any thing elſe, but in order to that End, to which it is properly conducible, and therefore in order to that only, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally deſirable.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. It adds a ſweetneſs to the enjoyment of the Creature, which cannot be had without it, becauſe it mingles with it the ſight of the great Maſter of this Family of the Earth, that provides it, the ſenſe and ſecurity of his Love that gives it, and ſo brings up the enjoyment of the Creature to a higher ſtation, and nearer to that, which is the true Felicity of the Soul. A Blue Ribon bought in a Shop, and a Blue Ribon given by a King in token of Honour, is the ſame thing, but with the latter, there is a mingling of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what elſe with it, as it imports a Gift from a King in token of Honour, and therefore higher-prized.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. It takes away all that Sollicitouſneſs in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment, and all that Anguiſh in the Loſs, and all that Anxiety in the Proviſion of external Accommodations, though in very truth, the real Happineſs of the <hi>Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> is its ſubſiſtence, according to the perfecteſt degree of his Being, which is the perfection of the <hi>Compoſitum;</hi> yet it is clear, that the Tumultuouſneſs, or Quietneſs of the Mind, doth much conduce to the Happineſs, or unhappineſs of the <hi>Compoſitum:</hi> That Man that lives contentedly with 20. <hi>l.</hi> a year, is happier than he that lives as well with the ſame or a greater Portion, but

with an anxious, troubled, craving, unſatisfied Mind. Now when the Soul truly knows, and is truly ſet upon his Supream End, it knows its duty, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is not idle, it knows the Power of his Maker, therefore is not anxious; and knows the uſe and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of the Creature, and therefore values it no farther, than it is uſeful to its proper End; it knows the Love and Wiſdom of his Maker, and therefore refers all to him, as he that wants neither Power to provide for it, nor Wiſdom to proportion, nor Love to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, according to the exigence of my condition; and admit he doth, his Will muſt be done, and not mine, I am provided well enough; for if here I am contented, and hereafter ſaved, this ſweetens any Loſſes.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Though the Great God be abſolute Lord of his Creature, and is not bound farther to him, than it pleaſeth him, though his Creature were moſt conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his Will, yet I do not think, but, if our Hearts were and did continue right ſet upon our great and Supream End, and could hold to it, that we ſhould want a convenient Portion of theſe outward Bleſſings, which would make our Lives comfortable and happy: but here is the Miſery of Man, that any confluence of Externals preſently take off his Soul from a perfect purſuit of our great End, and faſten upon thoſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternals: therefore the Wiſe God oftentimes cuts out to the beſt of Men, a ſmall and an unpleaſant <hi>viati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi> that they may not linger in the way to their great End.</p>
                        <p>And as it is thus with the whole <hi>Compoſitum</hi> in this Life, ſo in the Reſurrection, when the Soul ſhall be reunited to the Body, both ſhall have a perfect Fruition of Happineſs in the enjoyment of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, Favour and Communion of God. How far forth the Soul ſeparated, is capable of its own nature
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:50435:59"/>
of any new knowledge, which it had not before, in an angelical way: or how far it is able to retain or improve thoſe Conceptions and Species that it had here; and whether it hath a compleat operation, or what degree of Fruition it hath of the ſight of God, it is above our reach to determine; only this we may conjecture, that the Soul is not placed in that perfect degree of being and ſubſiſtence as are the Angels, in as much as it is made in order to a Body, by which in it, it exerciſeth its motions, faculties, and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: and therefore without all queſtion, when it ſhall hereafter be reunited to a moſt perfect ſpirituali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed Body indiſſolubly, it ſhall not thereby receive any diminution or abatement of its Perfection and Felicity, but will thereby become more capable of a more perfect and full Fruition of that Supream Good, which will then be communicated perfectly to the whole <hi>Compoſitum.</hi> But this by the way, <hi>latius infra.</hi>

                        <p>HItherto we have proceeded in the examination of theſe 2. Parts: 1. What the Nature of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is of this Happineſs; and 2. What the Object of it: Now the third thing reſts to be ſought, <hi>viz.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. What is <hi>the Means of attaining this Supream End of Man,</hi> his Union to God: and herein we ſhall <hi>examine</hi> theſe three <hi>things:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. What naturally might be conjectured to be the Means of acquiſition of this Happineſs?</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Whether, as things ſtand with Man, the ſame Means be to be found or no?</p>
                        <p n="3">3. If not, then whether there be any Means left for Man to attain this Supream End of his or no? and what it is? and how to be known?</p>
                        <p>Touching the firſt: Though God by his power might carry every thing to his proper, mediate, or ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate End, without the intervention of any Means; yet, as it is his own peculiar Prerogative by his Will to appoint every thing to its proper End, wherein is ſeen the Glory of his Goodneſs; ſo the ſame Will of his hath ordered, hath appointed every thing to move to this End by a certain Rule, and certain Means, and herein is ſeen the Glory of his Wiſdom: ſuch are the Inſtincts and Inclinations of the Creatures, by which they move to their ſpecial Ends and Perfections: And as theſe Inclinations are planted by God in the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Creature, the like was done, though in a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent manner, in Men at firſt, in all probability of
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:50435:60"/>
Reaſon, the difference being only thus, in the Creature all that is conducing to their End is made a piece or quality of their Nature, in Man not altogether, as ſhall be ſeen. We have found Man indued with two great Faculties, Underſtanding and Will and in theſe principally conſiſts the receptiveneſs of his Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and the motion to it.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Touching <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> it is a Faculty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive of an Object that may be known; but that Object is not of the nature or eſſence of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, but diſtinct from it: So that Man might be created an intellectual Creature, yet till ſuch time as naturally through the Senſes, or ſupernaturally by the immediate infuſion or demonſtration of God, he was but <hi>raſa tabula.</hi> The firſt thing therefore, that was put into the Underſtanding in order to his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream End, was a ſtock of Knowledge of God, and of that Will of God which concerned Man. And this Will of God concerning Man was that Means, which, if known and purſued, would guide a Man to true Happineſs: for, as is before obſerved, every thing is ſo far forth Beautiful and Happy, as it holds Conformity with the Will of God; and ſuch is his Wiſdom and Goodneſs, that when the Creature moves according to the Law and Will of its Maker, it doth without fail attain that Happineſs, whereof it is capable; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it moves to that End, for which it was appointed by the Firſt Cauſe: Now becauſe God hath made Man a Rational and Intellectual Creature he appointed a rational and intellectual way to move him to this End, <hi>viz.</hi> the Knowledge of himſelf, and of that Rule or Law, which ſhould lead him to that End.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The Underſtanding being thus enlightned with the Knowledge of God and his Will, <hi>the Will</hi> was endued with a Rectitude to move on according to that Rule, in order to the right End: and that, which was
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:50435:61"/>
in the Underſtanding <hi>ſub ratione Scibilis,</hi> was to the Will <hi>ſub ratione Legis,</hi> a <hi>thing</hi> not only ſhewn to the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, as the Means to bring him to Happineſs, but alſo injoyned to the Man as his Duty, under pain of Guilt and Vengeance: for herein conſiſts the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Inſtincts in the inferiour Creatures, and this Law given to Man; in thoſe it is not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Law, becauſe they are not intellectual nor volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Agents, therefore their receding from that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, though it ſubjects to a loſs and deformity, yet it ſubjects them not to any Guilt; but the Rule given to Man, was given to a Creature endued with Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to know what it was, and with Will that might obey it if he would. Therefore by the viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, Man muſt needs incur not only a loſs of that End, which this Rule alone could guide him to, but likewiſe a poſitive guilt, <hi>or</hi> obligation to ſuch farther puniſhment, as the rebellion of a Creature againſt his Maker might deſerve.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Conformity</hi> then to this Law neceſſarily induced two things: 1. Beauty in the Creature being conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Will of his Maker, which only denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates the Creature beautiful, and conſiſted principally in theſe three things: 1. Knowledge of God, and of his Will by the immediate demonſtration or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of God himſelf: 2. Righteouſneſs or Juſtice; for as the Will <hi>of God,</hi> and Law that proceeds from it, is the only ground of all Obligation to any thing under the name of Juſt; ſo it is the only Rule and Meaſure of Juſtice of Man toward God, Man, and himſelf. 3. Holineſs, <hi>viz.</hi> a Conformity of Man's Will, and conſequently his Actions, to the righteous and holy Will of the moſt Holy God: And as this was his Beauty, ſo it was his Happineſs initiate, and his way to conſummate Happineſs.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="83" facs="tcp:50435:61"/>And as this Conformity to the Law of God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced this Beauty and Happineſs in Man, ſo of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, <hi>the violation</hi> of this Law muſt introduce,
<list>
                              <item>1. <hi>Ataxy</hi> and Deformity in the Creature.</item>
                              <item>2. <hi>Puniſhment;</hi> and that of two kinds:</item>
                           </list>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Privative</hi> puniſhment, whereby he loſt what he had or might have had; and that is double:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. In reference to his Supream End, an irrecover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able loſs; for the Link is broken, the Violation of that Law, the exact performance whereof was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and the only means to attain that End, hath cut off that ordination that this Rule had to Man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> Felicity.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. In reference to the Means. The Light of the Underſtanding is put out, or much weakened, the Rectitude of the Will diſordered, and that irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verably. The Soul continues ſubſtantially the ſame, but theſe extrinſecal adventitious habits in the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and Will are removed. And as this Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of loſs is a natural conſequent of this Violation of this righteous and bleſſed Law, ſo it is inforced with the Sanction of that Law, which could do no leſs in juſtice than withdraw that Light, and that Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which was but a conſequent of that Law that is ſo unjuſtly violated.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Poſitive</hi> Puniſhment. For were it given but as a means to attain another thing, a puniſhment of loſs of the End muſt neceſſarily follow the violation of that, which is the only means to attain that End; But Man was endued with Underſtanding and Will, capable of the Knowledge and Obſervance of a Law, a Law framed by the Wiſe God, exactly ſuitable to thoſe abilities Man had to perform it, who gives Rules in all things proportionable to the nature of the thing to which he gives it: This Law promulged by the exact inſcription thereof in the Underſtanding, who both
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:50435:62"/>
knew what it was, and by whom, and for what End given; the Violation of this adds Rebellion to the Violation, and obligeth <hi>ex natura rei,</hi> to more than a Loſs.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Let us now examine, <hi>How things ſtand with the Children of Men,</hi> in order to the diſcovery and proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution and attaining of this ſupream and great End of his Creation: All things in the World beſides Man, come and keep very near unto the Law of their Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though ſome diſorder we may find in them: The reaſon is becauſe they move not freely, but natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, and the Rules, by which they move, are Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, Qualities, and Propenſions woven into their very Nature: But in Man it is otherwiſe; the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, eſpecially in his Underſtanding, whereby the whole Man is much ſteered, are extrinſecal and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventitious; and ſo without any eſſential change in his Nature, thoſe Habits or Principles may be loſt. And let us but examine the temper of Mankind, we ſhall find <hi>a general diſorder</hi> in all his Faculties, and want of thoſe Rules, which ſhould lead him to his Supream End.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. In the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding:</hi> We have ſhewn that Man had not only a veſſel receptive of that Light and Knowledge, which was his initiate, and his way to a conſummate Happineſs; but alſo had that Lamp of his fitted with that Oyl and Light, which though it was not part of his Eſſence, was the high Perfection of that Power or Receptivity: But we do now plainly find, that take any Man <hi>in puris naturalibus,</hi> he hath ſcarce ſo much as a knowledge either what himſelf is, or what his beginning was, or what his End is; and differs little from the higheſt degree of Beaſts: His Underſtanding and Reaſon is eſſential, but the matter or furniture of theſe is wanting. The ſupply of theſe defects muſt needs be therefore extrinſecal, which is
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:50435:62"/>
either by Inſtruction and Information, or Tradition from others. Thus doubtleſs much of the Knowledge that is in the World is propagated even from the firſt Man: but this, the farther it was from the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, it grew weaker and weaker, and more cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, partly through the defects that were in thoſe that propagated it, partly through the ſupineneſs and negligence of thoſe that received it, and partly through the mixtures of the Fancies of Men, every Man ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a new piece of his own to what he received; and all truths the farther they are from the original grow the more corrupted; and by this means a little truth paſſing through divers hands, and receiving al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt from every hand ſome addition and mixture, in proceſs of time it hath grown as difficult to ſift out thoſe ſmall grains of Truth, which were thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated in the Ear, and crowd of other erroneous addittaments, as to retrieve thoſe Truths which the neglect of Men hath in effect loſt.</p>
                        <p>And as thus ſome Truths have been diſcovered, and tranſmitted from Man to Man, ſo by diligent Study and Obſervation ſome of thoſe Truths, that have been in effect loſt ſince the Creation of Man, have been recovered, and others, that have contracted erroneous ſuperſtructions or acceſſions, purged, both matters natural and metaphyſical. This hath been the buſineſs of the exacter ſort of Men, which as it is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſpecial Providence of the Almighty, ſo the higheſt endeavours of Men in this kind hath been ſtill mingled with much darkneſs: and it is ſeldom that the Wit or Learning of the ſucceeding Philoſopher diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered ſome Errors of him that preceded him, but the ſame natural imbecility appeared likewiſe in him, in producing ſome erroneous Opinion, which as much deſerved an expurgation, as that which he before corrected.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="86" facs="tcp:50435:63"/>And as this defect in the Underſtanding is viſible in Mankind, ſo it is moſt viſible in that which is the way or rule unto our Supream End, <hi>viz.</hi> Religion, that though Men of ſeveral Ages and Centuries, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Diſpoſitions, inclinations, Educations, agree in ſome common Principles concerning other matters, yet in matters of Religion, the differences have ever been wonderful. The reaſon is not only from the defect of our Underſtanding, but likewiſe from the nature of the Object, which falls not eaſily within the reach of thoſe Mediums, whereby the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing arrives to the attainment of other Truths, and therefore ſtands in need of ſome extrinſecal help to ſet him right in this.</p>
                        <p>It is true, that the great points of Religion, <hi>viz.</hi> the knowledge, that there is a God, and ſome things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his Eſſence; that he is the Cauſe of all things; that he made all things for his own End, and thoſe other things before mentioned, may be acquired by the Light of Nature and Reaſon: yet ſuch is the heighth and remoteneſs of the Subject, that it requires much Induſtry and Conſideration to carry us ſtep by ſtep unto this heighth: But when we have arrived to this (which few attain unto) yet there is ſo much confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in theſe Notions, and they are ſo far fetcht, that they make not that clear impreſſion upon the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding as is fit: But admit they did, yet we are ſtill to ſeek what is that Rule, whereby to lead us to attain to our great End; and this we rove at.</p>
                        <p>In the ways of the Children of Men concerning Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, we may obſerve theſe Several ſteps of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. An Ignorance, whether there be any God or no: This is the groſſeſt Ignorance, becauſe it is againſt the firſt and moſt univerſal Principle; for the affirmation of the being of any thing is the firſt foundation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:50435:63"/>
every Inquiry is built: this is Atheiſm and meer Brutiſhneſs.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. When a Man hath once ſtated that queſtion affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matively, That there is ſome Superior Power, the next queſtion, and the next ſtep of Man's Ignorance is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Nature of this God; What he is, Whether one or more, Whether viſible, and if ſo, What vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This, though it may by natural Reaſon be ſtated very far, as appears before, and ſo this Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance receive a cure in a great meaſure; yet ſo far are our Intellectuals darkened in this matter, that Men are hardly ſet right in this: And hence grew thoſe ſtrange varieties of Gods in the World: this is the cauſe of Idolatry, and Polytheiſm.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. When a Man is rightly Principle'd concerning God, and conſequently concludes that he is the Cauſe of all things, the next ſpecial queſtion is, Whether God hath given to every thing his ſeveral End, and Rule or Law conducing to that End? and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Whether he hath appointed to Man any End and Rule, conducing to that End different from other Creatures? or, Whether he be left to do as he pleaſeth, and not confined by the Will of God to ſome End and Rule conducing to it? the Ignorance of this is the Cauſe of Supineneſs, Epicuriſm, Impiety, and profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Injuſtice.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. When a Man, finding that God is a free and intellectual Agent, and ſees, as he may by natural Reaſon, every thing ordered to a ſuitable End to his Being, and by a ſuitable Means or Rule conducing to that End, and finds a higher degree of being in himſelf than in other Creatures, and conſequently an higher End, and conſequently an higher Rule conducing to that End, he doth moſt naturally reſolve this Rule into that Law, which by the Will of God is given to Man condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to that End, the Subject of which Rule muſt be
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:50435:64"/>
all his Internal and External Actions, both in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to God, to himſelf, and to others: but here then is the next queſtion, and the next degree of Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance in Men, <hi>viz.</hi> What that Law or Will of God is concerning Man? and from hence grow thoſe Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties and Errors in Worſhip of God. And though haply moſt Men, knowing the true God, may by the ſame Light of Nature concur in the general and fundamentals of Worſhip, <hi>viz.</hi> That God is to be feared with all Reverence; loved with all intention; obey'd with all ſincerity, chearfulneſs, and exactneſs: all which are but natural concluſions from the Nature of God, the Nature of Man, and the Relation that he beareth to God, as his Creator, Lord, and Preſerver: yet, becauſe we know not what that Will of God par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly is, we frame ſeveral ways and Rules of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, according as our ſeveral Fancies perſwade us to be agreeable to that Will, which are either unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and ſuperſtructive, or erroneous and offenſive; and, which is the moſt dangerous Ingredient, conclude both his own way neceſſary, and the other dangerouſly Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous.</p>
                        <p>Theſe Defects in the Underſtanding muſt needs be the cauſe of much Error and Obliquity in the whole Man and his Actions: And theſe defects are moſt clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly viſible in the whole World; nay in the moſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Climates, Times, and Perſons thereof. In the laſt part, concerning the Worſhip of God, we ſee ſeveral ſorts of Men highly opinionated concerning their own particular Way or Worſhip; and moſt Magiſterially condemning the way of others, as bad as Paganiſm; when it may fall out,<note place="margin">This the Author hath elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where conſidered in two or three ſeveral little Tracts upon this Subject.</note> and ſo for the moſt part it doth, that what is ſuperadded beyond the plain and ſincere Fear of God, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to his Will, Thankfulneſs for his Mercy, Belief
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:50435:64"/>
of the great Means he hath provided for our Salvation, and thoſe other grand Principles, whereof before and anon; are but meer Superſtructions of Humane Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Ignorance, Imbecility or Policy, and yet made the greateſt part of the buſineſs, and inquiries, and differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces among Men in matters of this Nature.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. In the <hi>Will</hi> we find ſeveral Defects:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Thoſe that are conſequential to the Ignorance or darkneſs, or impotence of the Underſtanding, whoſe Deciſions doth, or ſhould, preceed the act of the Will: Were the Underſtanding truly principle'd with the knowledge of God, of his Perfection, Power, and Will; with the knowledge of our ſelves, our Nature, and the Dependence we have upon him in our being and continuance; thoſe practical Concluſions, that would moſt clearly and neceſſarily ariſe from theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> of Love to his Majeſty, Fear of Offending, Care to conform to his Will, Dependance upon him, Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to him, Contentedneſs and Chearfulneſs in him, Valuation of the World according to its true Eſtimate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> would moſt effectually follow in the Will, and thoſe Affections that are ſubſervient to it, and conſequently in the Life and Actions of Men, one Divine Principle, ſoundly and clearly ſeated in the Underſtanding, would improve it ſelf into infinite pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical deductions for the regulation of the Will: But where theſe are wanting, the motions of the Will muſt needs be excentrick: But where they are but weakly and doubtfully received in the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the operation of the Underſtanding upon them is but weak; the inclinations in the Will weaker, and eaſily overmatcht with the leaſt difficulty, and ſeldom arrive to action, or conſtancy in the life; for accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the meaſure, and intention, and clearneſs of the Conviction of the Underſtanding concerning any Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, the more fruitful, rational, and powerful are
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:50435:65"/>
thoſe practical Concluſions deduced from it; and the more intenſe and natural is the motion of the Will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to theſe Concluſions; and according to that intenſiveneſs of the Will are the Actions that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Will: a faint Conviction moves the Will but weakly, and a weak Volition ſeldom ends in Action.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Impotency: Not only that which ariſeth from the Impotency of the Underſtanding, the Convictions there; but that Impotency which is in the very Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty it ſelf, which is evident in this, that it is brought under the inferiour Faculties, over which it ought to govern, the Paſſions and Senſual Appetite: For though it be certain, that oftentimes the miſplacing, or overacting of our Paſſions, and the violent purſuit of Pleaſures, ariſeth from the miſtake or blindneſs of the Underſtanding, yet it is clear that oftentimes contrary to thoſe very Convictions and Rational Deciſions of the Underſtanding the Will is precipitated, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away with the violence and importunity of thoſe Faculties, that in right Reaſon, and by the Law of Nature are ſubordinate to her.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Privation and abſence of Inclinations conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Will of God, Righteouſneſs and Holineſs. The whole Soul was formerly the ſeat of God's Image: that part of it, that was moſt conſpicuous in, and conſonant to the Underſtanding, were the Principles of Truth, or Conformity to the Divine Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: thoſe Principles that were moſt proper to the Will, were the Principles of Holineſs and Juſtice, or Conformity to the Divine Will. Now as Truth is not of the Eſſence of the Underſtanding, which is only a Power receptive of it; ſo neither is Holineſs and Juſtice of the Eſſence of the Will. And as Man in a great Meaſure hath loſt that ſtock of Truth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he is ignorant; ſo it is apparent he wants that ſtock
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:50435:65"/>
of Righteouſneſs and Holineſs in his Will, which ſhould incline and move the Will according to the Will of God.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. There are not only theſe privative Evils in the Will, but it is likewiſe evident, that there is a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Malice or Inclination againſt Righteouſneſs and Holineſs, a propenſion and inclination to that which is Evil. Certain it is, that the Senſual Appetite of the Senſitive Creatures is good, and conformable to their Nature, and doth not carry them to any thing beyond the conveniency of their own Nature: and queſtionleſs, Man in his original had a Senſual Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite no leſs conformable, and ſuitable to his own ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Nature, than the ſenſual Appetite of another Creature is to his: and beſides that parity between other Creatures and Man, he had an advantage of a Reaſonable Soul, which might ſupply and regulate the defects or irregularities of the Senſual Appetite, if any were: How then comes it to paſs, that the poor ſenſual Creatures move conformable to their Nature, and by a kind of Rule, and Man alone runs into thoſe Exceſſes and ſtrange Prodigies of Vices, whereof an inferiour Creature is capable, but abhors the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittal? For inſtance, God hath ordained the Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Senſible Creature, by eating things ſuitable to the Nature and Conſtitution of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and in order to the uſe of that Means, hath planted a natural Appetite in the Creature to thoſe Meats; and the more to excite that Appetite for the uſe of that Means to that End, hath put a confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity between the taſte of that Meat and the Palate: Yet we do ſeldom ſee the Appetite of the Senſitive Creatures carry them in eating or drinking beyond moderation, or that End, for which that Appetite is given; but the motion of their Appetite is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſurate to the Means of their Preſervation: but in
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:50435:66"/>
Man we find in all Ages and Places ſtrange Exceſſes, beyond the conveniency of Nature, and that with iteration and profeſſedneſs. Again, in Creatures we find God hath appointed the Conjunction of the Male and Female to be the means of continuation of their Species; and the more to excite the Creature to the continuation of its Kind, there is a Delight mingled with that natural Action; yet we never ſee the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Creature divide the Action from the End: But among Men we find in all times thoſe Prodigies of Luſts, as Proſtitution, Beaſtiality, Buggery, and other unnatural commixtions. The like Inſtances might be given of Cruelty, and excogitated Tortures, and Crimes of like nature, whereby Men do not only againſt Reaſon, but alſo againſt, and beyond the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural inclination of the Senſitive Appetite. So that it is evident, there is not only an Imbecility in the Will of Man, whereby it is ſubordinate to its Servants and Handmaids, but likewiſe a Depravation and Poſitive Maliciouſneſs againſt the Rule of the Will of God. Much Labour hath been in the World by the wiſer ſort of Men, what by moral Perſwaſions and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, what by Government and Humane Laws, to ſuppreſs or reform the Defects of Mens Natures; which as they evidence in themſelves, that Man is not what he ſhould be, ſo the daily new Remedies do ſufficiently evidence the fruitfulneſs of the Diſeaſe, and the weakneſs of the Remedy.</p>
                        <p>Theſe things conſidered, three things are the <hi>evident Conſequents,</hi> viz.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That, as things ſtand with the Children of Men, they are not in a condition to attain everlaſting Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, by reaſon of theſe two eminent Defects in thoſe Faculties, by which we muſt attain to it, <hi>viz.</hi> the Underſtanding and Will.</p>
                        <p n="2">
                           <pb n="93" facs="tcp:50435:66"/>2. That, although theſe two Defects could be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, yet it is impoſſible for us, in that condition where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we are, to attain it; becauſe we have violated that Rule, which unleſs uniformly kept, 'tis impoſſible to attain it; the chain is broken.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. That this violation of this Rule hath not only made us liable to the Loſs of that Good whereunto it might have conduced; but hath added Rebellion to our Fault, and Obligation to Puniſhment, as well as Loſs.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, before he can poſſibly attain that End, to which he was created, he muſt be put in the ſame condition, in which he was created, and which alone could make him capable of that End; which is in a Conformity to Truth in his Underſtanding, or Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, a ſtate of Conformity to the Will of God, in his Will by Righteouſneſs and Holineſs; a ſtate of Innocence, or Freedom from Guilt, which is the cauſe, both of his merit of Loſs and Puniſhment. Till theſe be in ſome meaſure attained, it is impoſſible for a Man to attain true Happineſs, and when attained, then he may, becauſe now reſtored to the ſame condition in effect, in which created.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Theſe things being premiſed, we are now to ſeek out, What that <hi>Means</hi> is <hi>for the Reſtitution of Man,</hi> to that Capacity of Happineſs, in which we have reaſonably concluded he was created, and from which it appears by experimental obſervations he is declined: Concerning which we ſhall conclude:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That it is <hi>not in Man, nor in the whole compaſs of created Nature,</hi> to put himſelf in that condition of Knowledge, Juſtice or Innocence, which might make him capable of that Happineſs, for which he was at firſt created. Let us look into our Underſtanding, it is evident, as before, that all Knowledge is extrinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal to the Underſtanding, and every Object is original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:50435:67"/>
received from without, and that if it be a corporeal Object falling within our Senſes, then by means of them, though after they are received, the Intellect, being furniſhed with Materials, makes pretty work out of them by its own ſtrength; but if it fall not within the reach of Senſe, ſome other means muſt be to convey and reach it unto our Underſtanding. It may be in Nature there are objects or qualities in corporeal Bodies that do not ſuit with any of our Five Senſes, nor are receptible by them; yet it is as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for us to imagine what they be, as to frame in our ſelves a Conception or Senſe that might receive them. It is true, that by the ſtrength of Reaſon, we do find out divers Truths of a high Nature, concerning God and his Works, yet in theſe we may ſee, 1. a great deal of difficulty and rarety to attain them, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially without ſome pre-exiſtent means of diſcovery, even of the things themſelves, by ſome Tradition or Revelation, and ſo we rather aſſert the Truths diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to our hands, than diſcover them: 2. A great deal of confuſion, darkneſs, and diſorder, in thoſe things we ſo diſcover, as the new cured Man ſaw Men walking like Trees: 3. A great deal of diffidence and diſtruſt of thoſe things we diſcover, ſcarce daring to truſt our own Judgments with what we have by our diligence retrieved. But whatever may be ſaid concerning the diſcovery of the ſame Truths, yet ſure we are, that there are divers Truths, that infinitely concern us, that all our Inquiry ſhall never diſcover, without ſome extrinſecal help of a higher nature than Senſe. There were ſome, and but ſome Men by their natural helps, and yet not without the help of long Tradition, diſcovered, or rather more clearly illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the former kind of Truths, <hi>viz.</hi> concerning the Deity, the Creation of all things, the Immortality of the Soul, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But of this latter, never any Man had,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:50435:67"/>
or could have, any diſcovery, without a diſcovery from a higher original, ſuch are the Covenant of God with Man in his Creation, the Fall, the Reſtitution of Man by Chriſt, the laſt Judgment, and Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereof anon.</p>
                        <p>And as it fares thus with our Intellectuals, ſo the Principles of Juſtice towards God, our ſelves, and others, in our Will, can never be recovered by all the helps of Nature. It is true, that by Tradition from Father to Son, which nevertheleſs is extrinſecal, ſome general Principles of natural Juſtice and Holineſs are traduced; but the farther and the elder they grew from their Original, the more corrupt ſtill they were; and it was the Buſineſs of the wiſer part of the World, ſtill to repair and heal theſe Defects, which grew here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by: but as their Helps and Remedies were ever too weak to meet with the corruptions of Man's Will, ſo they were for the moſt part defective; for they ſtill provided for that part only or principally, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the Civil Society of Men, which was the thing that was viſible, and viſibly prejudiced by thoſe Enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of the Will of Men, and never lookt higher to the great relation between God and Man, but only made uſe of that as a politick piece in order to the government of the Civil Society: although even in that part, that concerned the Mutual Offices be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Men, which hath been the greateſt Buſineſs of the wiſeſt Philoſophers, we ſhall find that abſurdity, difference, and injuſtice even in the Wiſeſt of them, that it is clear, they were not their Crafts-maſters, even in that piece of Morality, wherein long Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and the Experience of the daily inconveniences which did ſpring from the diſtempers of Man's Will even in matters of Civil Society and Commerce.</p>
                        <p>But ſuppoſe we all this were curable, yet what cure can we find for any one Offence againſt the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:50435:68"/>
which we have made in Nature with the God of Nature, which, as we have before ſtated, ſubjects to a double penalty of Loſs and Senſe? none can take away an Obligation, but he with whom it is made, By what imaginable means can any Man, that hath contracted a guilt againſt his Maker, expiate that guilt? It is true, the God againſt whom it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted may, if he pleaſe, of his own free Power and Goodneſs, remit it, without any ſatisfaction. But how do we know whether it be his Will to do it? or if it be, upon what Terms? or by what Means he will do it? or what Means is there in the World that may be imaginably proportionable to it? the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Creature to God is infinite, becauſe he owes him his Being, which is a thing of the moſt boundleſs Conception; the Violation of that Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is therefore an infinite Obliquity, becauſe a breach of an infinite Obligation. What then can we imagine proportionable to ſuch an Offence? If we do all that is imaginable, it is ſtill but what we are bound to do, and therefore cannot expiate for what we were bound not to do; nor is there any thing in the World of an infinite Value, beſides the great God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not anſwerable to expiate the breach of an infinite Obligation.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Now therefore it remains, that we look out for a higher Means for the cure, than what we find with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Verge of created Nature, <hi>viz. from the great God,</hi> who firſt infuſed into the Soul thoſe Objects of Truth, which were the means of Happineſs, in the Underſtanding; that Rectitude, which was by him at firſt placed in the Will; that Innocence, which was at firſt in Nature, which is now loſt by the violation of that Law, which was the Means of Man's Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the removal of that Guilt which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by that Violation.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="97" facs="tcp:50435:68"/>The Defect in the Underſtanding conſiſts, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in two things: Want of a clear Light to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Object; and Ignorance of the Object, which ſhould be entertained. For the cure of this, we muſt of neceſſity derive from God a double Cure: Firſt, an addition of Light in the Underſtanding: Secondly, an Union of thoſe Truths or Objects, neceſſary to be known, unto the Faculty thus enlightned by ſome means of diſcovery.</p>
                        <p>The Defect of our Wills conſiſting in an abſence of theſe practical Principles of Juſtice, Holineſs, and Conformity to the Will of God; and in the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and diſorder of the Will, there is required to the cure thereof, a conveying unto the Will of theſe Perſwaſions to conform to the Will of God, and a Strengthning and healing of the weakneſs and perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Will, that it may effectually entertain theſe Perſwaſions.</p>
                        <p>The contracted Guilt muſt have a double Cure, <hi>viz.</hi> Of Abſolution from the poſitive Puniſhment, and Reſtitution of the Loſs contracted by it. The former frees him from poſitive Miſery incurred, the latter reſtores him to the capacity of enjoyment of the Happineſs loſt.</p>
                        <p>It being therefore clear, and to be granted, That as things ſtand with Man, he hath not this means of his Cure in or from himſelf, but muſt derive it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now loſt, from him, who at firſt gave it him, the next Enquiry is, <hi>Whether God hath appointed any</hi> Means for the cure of Man's Ignorance, Perverſeneſs, and Guilt, and conſequently to lead him to Happineſs, and what it is? wherein we <hi>conclude,</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. That God in his infinite Wiſdom and Goodneſs hath revealed, and conveyed to the Children of Men, the Means of their Happineſs, in ſeveral times, by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ways, and in ſeveral degrees in all ſucceſſions of times.</p>
                        <p n="2">
                           <pb n="98" facs="tcp:50435:69"/>2. That this Diſcovery and Means of Happineſs, he hath by the courſe of his Providence put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and diffuſed to Man-kind in the Compilation of the <hi>Old and New Teſtament,</hi> wherein are contained, not only the clear Diſcoveries of things to be Known and Believed, conducing to Man's everlaſting Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but likewiſe things to be Done, and effectual Perſwaſions for the doing of it.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. That in the Uſe thereof, there are not only the natural Means of diſcovery of Truths neceſſary to be known, of things to be done, and moſt effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual and powerful Perſwaſions beyond all other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Arguments to the Obedience thereof, but likewiſe a ſtrong Concurrence of the Power of God (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Will) ſubduing the Underſtanding to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and the Will to obey.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. That by this Belief of thoſe neceſſary Truths, and Obedience to the Will of God thus revealed, Man ſhall be conducted to his everlaſting Happineſs, which was the great End of his Creation.</p>

                        <p>But if we look into this Book of God, we find all theſe difficulties extricated: we find the preſervation of this Order in the Creatures, to proceed from, and depend upon the Wiſdom and Power, and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an infinite and intellectual Being; who, whiles his Creature for the moſt part moves according to the Rule of his own Nature, yet wonderfully manageth them to Ends and Events which they dream not of; who, whiles the ſeveral contrary qualities, that he hath planted in Bodies, could be deſtructive one of another, he hath ſo fenced their extremities one from another, that one deſtroys not another, and yet ſo tempers and allays them, that they concur in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of other things. There we find the various and moſt contingent motions of the Creatures, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhalled by a Wiſe Providence to the production of thoſe Events, that the ſecret Counſel of the great God had appointed; ſo that whiles with one Eye we ſee ſeemingly accidental caſual motion of the World, like the Finger upon the Dyal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we may with the other Eye ſee in that Book, that wheel of Providence, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and turning it rationally, and with election, for thoſe Ends, that it pleaſeth the Wiſe Governour of all things to order.</p>

All theſe Perplexities we find ſoon reſolved in that Book of God, ſhewing us, That <hi>Juſt and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt,</hi> is only meaſurable by the Will of God; that the <hi>Obligation</hi> of Juſt or Unjuſt, ariſeth from the meer Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God, and that relation of Duty which Man owes to his Creator, and to the injunction that he gives: ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us the falſity of every of thoſe Poſitions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Chief Good, and teaching us that it is to be had, and to be had only in the enjoyment of our Creator.</p>
                        <p>True it is, that many of theſe, and the like Truths, may be arrived at by the light of Reaſon: But 1. It is not without much Difficulty and Labour, and that of the moſt choice Men: 2 It is not without the help of Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, at leaſt of ſome ſmall Veins of theſe Truths: 3. It is not without much mixture of corruptions, errors and miſtakes: 4. Not without much heſitancy and doubting. Our natural Reaſon as it lies in the Ore, and therefore muſt be diſgroſſed from its droſs, by ſtudy and Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſo it is weak and muſt be ſupported. And where the ſtrength of Reaſon is the ſame, that Truth that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſcovers, is entertained with more confidence, than if a Man ſingly had diſcovered it; ſo that by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, Reaſon is enlighten'd and ſtrengthened in thoſe Truths, which carry in them a conſonancy to Reaſon, and might haply, though in a weaker meaſure, and with more difficulty, have been extracted out of ſound Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Obſervation.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. It doth contain divers <hi>Truths, which could never be diſcovered, but by God himſelf:</hi> as what the Will of God was, that Man ſhould do, or the Law of God; What the purpoſe of God was, concerning Man, both in his Fall, and Reſtitution by Chriſt; The Covenant which he made with the <hi>Jews,</hi> and with us in Chriſt; The uniting of the Divine and Humane Nature in the Perſon of Chriſt; The laſt Judgment; The motion of the great God towards his Creature, in Mercy and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:50435:72"/>
Judgment, and the like. Theſe, as they are beyond the diſcovery of any Man, ſo they were too high for any Man to invent or ſurmiſe. It is true, the Heathen Law-givers and Philoſophers, to gain Credit to their Laws and Dictates, durſt ſometimes to patronize them upon Heaven: but in them, a conſiderate Man might clearly find thoſe Laws to have ariſen from a meer obſervation of the viſible Inconveniences to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Societies, and a prudential application of ſuch Rules, as might meet with thoſe Inconveniences: the original of them was attributed to Divine Inſtitution, to gain Reputation and Opinion in the Vulgar: but in truth all, or at leaſt thoſe that were the beſt, and beſt grounded, were as naturally deducible from the obſervation of the Conveniences and Inconveniences of a civil Society, as the Concluſions of Geometry or Arithmetick, are grounded upon their Principles: and therefore for the moſt part, Humane Laws did in ſubſtance agree in the Points conſiſting in the relation between Man and Man, as being more obvious and plain; and did for the moſt part diſagree and differ in thoſe Points that concerned Religion, as being more diſtant and difficult:</p>
                        <p>Now <hi>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>In <hi>Anſwer</hi> to this, we muſt premiſe two things,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That it is poſſible, there may be ſome intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible Objects and Truths in the World, that never any Man did, nor without the help of a foreign diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, never can find out. If a Man were ſuppoſed to be born without the Faculty of Seeing, it were not
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:50435:72"/>
poſſible for him to diſcover that quality or motion of a natural Body, which we call Light, or Colour; nay, ſcarce to underſtand it, though a very rational Diſcourſe were made concerning it. And what Man can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, but that there may be, and are, divers qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities or motions of natural Bodies, which are without the Verge of any of our Senſes, and conſequently, never fall into humane diſcovery? We clearly admit Spirits, and we have notions of their motion loca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and ſubſtance; yet it is impoſſible for any Man by natural indagation, without the help of ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecal relation, to find it out: We may therefore conclude, That as it is poſſible there may be, ſo it is probable there are ſome intelligible Objects and Truths, which we cannot diſcover without an extrinſecal help or diſcovery.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That of neceſſity many of thoſe Truths contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Scripture, eſpecially concerning the Deity, the Will of God, the Fall of Man, and the Means of his Reſtauration, are things that cannot be collected or concluded by any natural Reaſon, partly in reſpect of the ſublimity of their Nature, being beyond the Verge of Senſe and natural Diſcourſe; partly becauſe they are Emanations of a free Agent, whereof no other Reaſon can be given, but the Will of the Agent, and conſequently, not deducible into Knowledge or Aſſent, by rational Concluſions.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. That though the diſcovery of, or aſſent unto thoſe Truths, cannot be elicited by natural Reaſon, yet they are not contrary to natural Reaſon, but may be Truths, notwithſtanding any reaſon that can be given againſt them. It is true, that they, being above the reach of Reaſon, cannot be by force of Reaſon aſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto; yet there is no reaſon againſt the truth of them. Natural Reaſon hath a privative oppoſition to the knowledge of them, <hi>viz.</hi> an abſence of a neceſſity

And as there is that mutual atteſtation by way of Congruity of one of theſe ſublime Truths, to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the ſame nature, ſo the Congruity that theſe Truths have to thoſe Truths, which rationally chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge an Aſſent from us, That all things had a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from the Firſt Cauſe, is a Truth evident in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but in what way, or by what manner, is not poſſible to be known without a diſcovery. How ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently doth that diſcovery of the manner of the Creation ſerve, as I may ſay that Principle? So again, that Man, being endued with a rational and immortal Soul, was ordered by the Firſt Cauſe to an immortal End, by a rational Means preſcribed by God, may be concluded by rational inferences and deductions; but what that Means was, or clearly, what that End was, is not diſcoverable by natural Reaſon; for it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the Will of God. How admirably doth the Scripture diſcover that Means, <hi>viz.</hi> the Law of God, and that End, the Viſion and Fruition of God, eſpecially in the point of the Reſurrection. Again,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:50435:73"/>
That the Violation of that Rule, muſt incur a Guilt irreparable; a loſs of that End, is rationally evident; yet although that Man by that Guilt, is juſtly depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable of that End, is clear; yet that God ſhould be diſappointed in this End, ſeems ſomewhat hard. How clearly doth the Point of our Redemption by Chriſt (a point inconceptible by Nature) ſerve to extricate and untwiſt this difficulty, gives God the Glory of his Juſtice, and of his Mercy, of his Wiſdom, and of his Creature? Thus the ſubſervience of a Truth more difficult to the exigence of a Truth, that is more clear to Nature, renders the former not only poſſible, but probable.</p>

The third Evidence, That this is the Word of God, are thoſe ſtrange <hi>Predictions</hi> of moſt contingent Events, <hi>fulfilled</hi> in their ſeveral times; the Prediction in one Age, and declared by one Inſtrument of God, the fulfilling in another Age, declared by another, or ſeen by our ſelves.

                        <p n="5">5. This Book alone, and none beſides, but by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivation from it, <hi>containeth matters of the moſt noble and uſeful nature.</hi> The generality of all humane Learning, do either in their Object or Uſe, or both, expire with this Life; and none ever arrived to the diſcovery of the great and adequate End of Man. This is not only evident in theſe Arts or Sciences of Natural Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, the Mathematicks, Phyſicks, Politicks, Laws, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which at their higheſt, are but only ſubſervient to this Life, but in thoſe two great and noble Sciences, that Speculative of Metaphyſicks, that other Practical of Moral Philoſophy: The former, though it arrive to as high Truths as Nature can diſcover, yet it reſts in the knowing of them, and in a meer Speculation, and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:50435:74"/>
doth not ſhew wherein conſiſts Man's true Happineſs, much leſs, what is the way to attain it; for the latter, the moſt ſublime piece of it, is framed only for the Meridian of this Life, both in the Uſe and End. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all queſtion, the Great and Wiſe God did write in Man's Nature, Habits exactly conducible to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Contentment and Felicity, in reference to his living in this World, as thoſe which were of a higher Conſtitution and End, as his communion with his Maker. The wiſeſt of Moral Philoſophers, though they have imperfectly copied out divers Poſitions of the former, as Juſtice, Temperance, Contentedneſs, Undervaluation of the World, Patience; yet they never arrived at the latter; no Book in the World but this, ſhews a Man the adequate End of his Being, his Supream Good, his Happineſs; nor directs the Means of acquiring it. This doth not only inforce the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs and value of the Book, but alſo the original of it, for when I ſhall ſee a world of the moſt exact humane Wits, turning every ſtone, as it were, within the reach of humane diſcovery, and yet none of them all lighting upon this great Subject, the way to eternal Happineſs, I muſt needs conclude, That this diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is of a higher extract, than a meer humane inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and although, when we have diſcovered that ſubject, we begin to wonder that Mankind hath thus long roved, and waſted its labour in thoſe other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent inquiries, and were ſo far from diſcovery of this <hi>

Man by his Sin hath loſt the greateſt part of his Light and Perfection; his own diſcoveries of his Duty are lame and imperfect; and till the God, that firſt planted theſe Principles of Knowledge and Conformity to his Will, give us a new Copy of them, we ſhall never clearly attain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them in our knowledge or practice. There are theſe <hi>Eminencies</hi> touching Moral Precepts, which this Book of God hath above all other Books in the World.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. No other Book in the World doth diſcover the true <hi>ground of the Obligation</hi> unto Moral Precepts. The Moral Philoſopher perſwades me to Temperance, to Juſtice, but what Obligation lies upon me for it? If he tells me, That it is his own Authority, my Anſwer is, He hath none over me, more than I have over him: If he tells me, the Law under which I live, binds me to it, I ſhall enquire what binds me to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve thoſe Laws, but Power, which if I can avoid by the like power or ſecrecy, I am not bound; or my own Conſent, which I am as well Maſter of, as I was before I conſented: If he tells me, the Law of Nature binds me, I am ſtill unſatisfied who gave that Law, or when, or to whom; and there the Philoſopher is to ſeek, as well of my Conviction, as of my Obedience: But this Book ſhews what that Law is, from whence the Obligation of Obedience to it ariſeth, even from that moſt Juſt and Uncontroulable Authority that God hath over his Creature.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. No other Book or Learning in the World per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades the obſervance of thoſe Laws, it injoyns with the like <hi>convincing and ſatisfying grounds of Reaſon</hi> that this doth: The higheſt ground that ever Moral Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:50435:75"/>
could fetch to perſwade to ſubmit to Moral Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, were but one of theſe: <hi>viz.</hi> The Reputation and general eſteem of Men, which dies with me, and while it lives, is nothing elſe but a Fancie, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains no Reality; or the Cohortion of the Laws, which if I can avoid with ſecrecy or force, I eſcape the ſtrength of the Perſwaſion; or that Congruity, that ſound Moral Precepts hold with Prudence, and the permanent enjoyment of good here; for it is a moſt certain Truth, as appears before, That the due obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Rules of right Reaſon hath a moſt clear connexion with Happineſs in this Life; and that the violation of theſe Precepts of Nature, do neceſſarily introduce a loſs of temporal Felicity: Theſe are the higheſt Motives of Obedience to theſe humane Docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: But let us look upon the Motives that the very ſame Precepts are enforced with, in this Book of God, we ſhall find them of a higher Conſtitution; we are there ſhewn, they are commanded by that God, to whom we owe our Being, and therefore may juſtly challenge our Obedience as his Tribute; by that God, from whom we daily receive our Preſervation and Mercies, and therefore may juſtly expert the return of our Love and Thankfulneſs in the Obſervance of his Will; by that God, that hath annexed a Sanction to the breach of his Law, which he both can, and will inflict; this may ſtartle our Fear; by that God, that hath propounded and promiſed a Reward to our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, both in this Life, and a future, which he will certainly confer; this doth quicken our Hope. Theſe and the like grounds, and motives of Obedience, fall upon the moſt active Affections, with the moſt powerful and rational Perſwaſion, and are able to conquer more difficulties in the Obedience of theſe very Precepts, that are materially the ſame, than all thoſe faint and thin Perſwaſions, that the wiſeſt of
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:50435:76"/>
Men could ever teach. The great God, that knows the frame of the Soul of Man, hath not only given rational Laws to lead him to his great End, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Means to draw out his Obedience, by appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Rewards or Puniſhments of his Obedience or Diſobedience; but alſo by the ſame Wiſdom of his, planted in him Affections, which might be proper to receive the impreſſions of thoſe Rewards and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: and by this Word of his conveys thoſe No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions into his Heart, which ſtick upon thoſe active Affections of Love, Hope, and Fear, in the moſt exact, full and adequate manner: This is therefore none elſe, but the Finger of God. And this is not only evinced by the Threatnings and Promiſes in this Book, but by the Hiſtorical part of it, applying the Truths of both; wherein we may ſee unriddled moſt of the varieties of Events, that fall upon a People, or Perſon, eſpecially knowing God, which without this Light, ſeem to be confuſed, and meerly contingent. <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſins, <hi>Iſrael</hi> is puniſhed: ſhe repents, and is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. We are ſhewn by the very Hiſtorical paſſages of the Old Teſtament, that when we are puniſhed, we eat but the fruit of our own ways.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. As the Eminence of the Scripture above other Learning, and conſequently its Original, is diſcovered in the two former, ſo in this, that it doth <hi>diſtinctly and clearly</hi> evidence, and ſet forth thoſe Moral Precepts, which are confuſedly and imperfectly only delivered by the beſt of humane Writers, eſpecially in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God: All agree God is to be worſhipped, but when they come to ſhew how, then they are to ſeek; for indeed, as it is folly for any one to think, that there can be any Worſhip of God acceptable, but what is agreeable to his Will; ſo it is vain to think, that this Will of his could be diſcovered by any but himſelf. And from the want of this grew Idolatries and other Vanities in Worſhip.</p>
                        <p n="4">
                           <pb n="113" facs="tcp:50435:76"/>4 The original of the Scriptures is diſcovered in this, that it doth contain in it <hi>Precepts of a higher Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,</hi> and therefore of a higher Pedegree, than the beſt of all humane Learning ever did arrive unto: ſuch as are the Cleanſing of the Heart and Thoughts from all Sin; That the Formality of Sin conſiſts in the Will, even before it expreſſeth it ſelf in Act; That the outward Conformity of the Act to Vertue, without the internal Conformity of the Will and Mind, is but Hypocriſie, and the ſeeming vertuous Action is at leaſt dead, and not of value, if not ſin; That a Vertuous Action done out of any other End, than in Obedience and Love to God, that enjoyns it, is not an Action rightly Principled, nor acceptable to God; The right directing of our Paſſions and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, that nothing is worthy of our intenſe Love but God; that nothing deſerves our Hate but Sin; and therefore teacheth us in the former, to deſpiſe the World; in the latter, to love our Enemies. The right temper of our Minds, in reference to all things without us, or befalling us in any Affliction and Trouble; It teacheth us to improve it in diſcovery and repenting of the cauſe of our ſin; in adhering to God, in whom there is no variableneſs; in keeping a looſe And remiſs Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to the World; in Contentedneſs, and chearful reſignation of our ſelves to God, that is Lord of his Creature, and though it ſhould not be meritoriouſly deſerved, might be juſtly inflicted: In times of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity and Comfort, it teacheth us to look to the Author, and take more delight in the hand that gives it, than in the Bleſſing it ſelf; to value the meaſure of my Comfort, more by the favour and good will of the Giver, than by the extent of the Gift: In the enjoyment to be Watchful, that I be not inſnared by it to forget the Giver, to be moderate, humble, wiſe: In the whole courſe of our Lives to look above
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:50435:77"/>
this World to another Country, and ſo we may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the the Favour of our God, and the Fruition of that Country; to be at a point with all the Pleaſures, Profits, Preferments, Honours, Comforts, and Life of this Life; to be ſo fixed in our Obedience to our God, as not to go out of the Path he hath put us in, though it be ſtrewed with all the Scorns, Miſeries, Torments, and Deaths, that Men or Hell could ſcatter to hinder us. Theſe and the like Precepts are given in that Word: and theſe and the like Effects it doth, by the concurrence of God's Grace, work in the Heart, which are as far beyond the moſt ſublimated Docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the moſt exact moral Philoſopher in the World, as theirs are beyond the moſt groſs Paganiſm: Theſe do proclaim therefore their original from a higher Principle than humane Authority, or Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And it is obſervable, that theſe are not only Principles of a high and noble extract, but of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular uſe in this Life: If all Men were of this Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, it would queſtionleſs, reform all thoſe Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences, which do happen either from one Man to another, as Enquiries, breach of Contracts; or from Man to himſelf; of diſcontent, vexation and unquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Mind, or diſorder in any Condition.</p>
                        <p>Now if it be ſaid, That it ſeems ſtrange, that God, who could have preſerved Man in the ſame Integrity of Mind, in which he was created, and could have ſupplyed Man with as uniform a motion to his End by a conſtant Means, as other Creatures by their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtincts, which are fixed and conſtant in them, ſhould take this Circuit, in reſtoring loſt Man by ſuch a Means, it is anſwered, That God having endued Man with Reaſon, Underſtanding, and Will, doth rather chuſe to bring about his purpoſes concerning him, by Rational Means conform to thoſe Faculties of Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and Will, putting Light into the one, and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:50435:77"/>
Regularity into the other, by ſuch means as is ſuitable to his Condition and Nature, and not by the actual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of his extraordinary Power, though not without the concurrence of his ſpecial Grace and Providence; as in thoſe other actions of Men, in preſerving the natural or civil Subſiſtence of Men, and Societies, he doth uſe the inſtrumental means of natural and politick Proviſions, rationally or naturally conducing to ſuch preſervation.</p>

                        <p>AND now we have drawn down the great Buſineſs of Man, by dark and intricate ſteps and windings to a clear Light, which doth not only clearly and compendiouſly unmask and unfold theſe Truths, which with ſo much difficulty of diſcourſe, and ſearch by Reaſon, we dimly arrive unto, but divers other Truths, which all the Reaſon and Learning of the Sons of Men, could never attain unto; yet ſuch, as without which all the Paſſages even of this Life, are dark and obſcure, and uncomfortable: We ſhall therefore now fall to the conſideration of thoſe <hi>Truths,</hi> which are <hi>contained in that Book,</hi> that are <hi>of the greateſt concernment to the Sons of Men,</hi> in order to their ſupream End, and to evidence their Congruity with ſound and rectified Reaſon.</p>

And we may obſerve, that even in this fundamental Truth, That there is a God, where theſe and the like Inſtructions are wanting, Men, that are naturally endued with the ſame Faculties of Reaſon and Underſtanding with us, have not, or not ſo clearly this Principle, as among Atheiſts and Pagans.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. This Book ſheweth us clearly <hi>the Eſſence, Nature and Attributes of God,</hi> as far forth as is comprehenſible by our humane Underſtanding. Many of theſe are by the help of natural Reaſon and Diſcourſe, legible in the things that are ſeen, ſo far forth, as to leave our Ignorance thereof unexcuſable, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20. yet as in the former, ſo much more in this, our Reaſon is helped and ſtrengthened in our ſpeedy diſcovery, and firmer aſſent thereunto, as likewiſe appears by the many Errors of Men of the ſame Faculties with us, even concerning theſe Principles.</p>

The Plurality of Perſons in one Eſſence is a Myſtery that is not attainable by all the Reaſon in the World, and is but obſcurely hinted in the Old Teſtament, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therefore it ſeems not underſtood by the <hi>Jews;</hi> but in the New Teſtament more plainly related: the diverſity of Perſons of the Father and Son in one Eſſence, <hi>John</hi> 14.9. <hi>John</hi> 17.5, 22.

                        <p>Now touching the Counſel of the Almighty, we are to <hi>diſtinguiſh between the act of Counſel, and the act of Knowledge:</hi> the firſt is properly an act of his Will, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determining what ſhall be; the latter, an act of his infinite underſtanding, which foreſees what ſhall be, without any actual Cauſality upon the things. Theſe, though they are not ſo much as accidentally differing in God, yet in our Apprehenſions there is a difference; ſo that we conclude, there is not only a Preſcience in God of all things that ſhall, or may be: <hi>Known unto the Lord are all his Works from the beginning:</hi> but likewiſe a Predetermination by his Divine Will of all things that ſhall be, and of the ſeveral means conducing to it. And this Counſel of God is in truth the ſupream Cauſe of all things: for as that Power, whereby all things do move themſelves or other things, is put into them by the great maker of all things, by the mere and immediate act of his Will, as hath been before obſerved; ſo the managing of all theſe ſeveral Powers, to the production of the ſeveral things in the World, is the act of the ſame Will of God: they move in their ſeveral Series, according to that Counſel of the great God of Heaven.</p>
                        <p>Now this Counſel of God is repreſented to us in the Scripture under theſe <hi>ſeveral qualifications.</hi> 1. An
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:50435:81"/>
Eternal Counſel. 2. An Immutable Counſel. 3. A Free Counſel. 4. A Wiſe Counſel. 5. An Active and Irreſiſtible Counſel. 6. An Univerſal Counſel.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. It is an <hi>Eternal</hi> Counſel, a Purpoſe and Counſel before the Foundation of the World, the indiviſible and unſucceſſive act of his Will. It is true, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of Men, as their Conceptions are ſucceſſive, one conſideration ſupplying the defect or imperfection of the former: and oftentimes the Counſels of Men are taken up <hi>pro re nata,</hi> principally becauſe they have not either the power to manage all the Emergencies and Ingredients into an Action according to their own Wills, nor to foreſee thoſe Accidents that might enervate or impede the fruit of his Counſels; but the Will of God is the Cauſe of all things; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as nothing can have a Being without his Will, ſo nothing can impede or hinder the Counſel of his Will.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. From hence it follows, that it is an <hi>Immutable</hi> Counſel; otherwiſe it cannot be Eternal; for what began to be otherwiſe, than it was before, cannot be Eternal. The Change of Counſels and Purpoſes among Men ariſe from one of theſe Cauſes: either from an intrinſecal Unſetledneſs and Unconſtancy, which is their imperfection; or from ſome extrinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Emergency, which either was not for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ſeen, or cannot be maſtered: but neither of theſe can fall upon God. It is true; what he wills, he wills freely, and therefore <hi>ex natura rei</hi> he might not have willed it; yet what he wills, he wills from all Eternity:<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.17.</note> with him there is no variableneſs nor ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of turning: <hi>I the Lord change not,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.6.</note> 
                           <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ye Sons of Jacob are not conſumed.</hi> And as there is no ground of change in himſelf, ſo neither is there any poſſibility of change from any thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him; becauſe the ſame Act of his Will, which
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:50435:82"/>
is his Counſel, is the cauſe and meaſure of the being of all things, and therefore it can no more hinder or alter his Counſel, than it can give it ſelf a Being againſt his Will. But becauſe there be ſome things that owe not their Formality to the Counſel of God, as Sin (which how far it falls within the Counſels of God, ſhall be hereafter conſidered) yet that cannot any way elude the Counſel of God, as ſhall be hereafter ſhewn: Therefore thoſe ſeveral paſſages in holy Scripture, that tell us, that God repented of Evil, when Man repented of Sin, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.14. <hi>Jonah</hi> 3.4. are not to be underſtood of the Nature or Counſels of God: for in that reſpect <hi>Balaam</hi> ſpoke a Truth of God, <hi>Numb.</hi> 23.19. <hi>God is not a Man, that he ſhould lye, nor the Son of Man, that he ſhould repent:</hi> For the ſame Counſel of God, which appointed <hi>Jonah</hi> to be the Inſtrument of <hi>Nineveh</hi>'s Repentance, ordained like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe their turning upon that preaching, and ordered the diverſion of that Judgment, which the ſame Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel had ordered to be imminent, but not executed: But becauſe there was the execution of ſuch a real change, which in Man is ordinarily the effect of a change of purpoſe, or repenting, therefore it is called a Repenting: yet the very ſame Counſel, that appointed the denunciation of an imminent Judgment, appointed their repenting upon that denunciation, and that diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, upon that repenting.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. It is a <hi>Free</hi> Counſel: it is nothing elſe, but the act of the Will of God. It is true, the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Will impoſeth a neceſſity of the exiſtence of the thing willed, yet the determination it ſelf was an act of the freeſt Agents. This excludeth any Stoical Neceſſity.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. It is a moſt <hi>Wiſe</hi> Counſel. And this is evident, even in the loweſt and moſt inconſiderable execution of this Counſel: and therefore <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.29. the diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:50435:82"/>
of this Counſel of God, even in the ſowing and threſhing of Fitches, concludes this alſo cometh forth from the Lord, who is wonderful in Counſel, and excellent in working: <hi>This Wiſdom is eminent in this:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. In that it doth <hi>not only predetermine the End or Event, but likewiſe all thoſe Means,</hi> that are conducible to the bringing to paſs of this End. It is true, God by an act of his Power might, and ſometimes doth, <hi>per ſaltum</hi> bring to paſs his own Purpoſe, by his own immediate Power: but this is not the ordinary courſe of the execution of his Counſel, but produceth the End Decreed, by Decreed Means, <hi>Acts</hi> 27. <hi>Paul</hi>'s dangerous Voyage is predetermined to end in a ſafe Arrival, Verſe 24. Yet Verſe 31. <hi>Except theſe Men abide in the Ship, ye cannot be ſaved.</hi> This Perſwaſion of <hi>Paul</hi>'s becomes prevalent, and they ſtay. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of God, that determined the Ship's ſafe arrival, predetermined the ſtay of the Men in the Ship, to be the means of that ſafety, and the perſwaſion of <hi>Paul</hi> to be the means of their ſtay. Here is the Link of God's Counſel, coupling the Event to his Purpoſe, with ſubordinate and purpoſed Means. When I ſee a Counſel of God diſcovered, that had not its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Execution in many hundreds of years after; and obſerve how many thouſands of ſtrange connexions of Accidents do intervene between the Counſel diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and the Execution of it; although till the execution, the event ſeems as unlegible as any thing in the World; nay, oftentimes theſe Antecedents, that ſeem moſt probable of any to the producing of the expected Event, with a contrary wind quite driven off and blaſted; yet when after all theſe ſeveral Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Succeſſes, I ſee the Effect come to paſs, even by moſt improbable and accidental Means, I muſt needs acknowledge, this ſeeming Confuſion is me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodically
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:50435:83"/>
managed by the ſame Counſel, that prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined the End; I muſt conclude, as the Wiſe Man doth in another caſe, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.14. <hi>God hath ſet the one over againſt the other, to the End, that Man ſhould find nothing after him.</hi> Let us conſider it in the great Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our Redemption by Chriſt: God in his Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Counſel had appointed Man to be partaker of his Glory by the death of Chriſt, who was the Lamb ſlain from the foundation of the World: Man is created in a glorious, happy, free Eſtate; he hath a Covenant made with him, which he may keep or break at his own liberty; he is left in his own hands, and not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitated to break that Covenant, which he but even now made with his Maker; if he had done ſo, the ſending of Chriſt had been needleſs: Man falls, now is Chriſt promiſed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. and after confined to the Line of <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 18.18. and after to the Line of <hi>David.</hi> See what a World of Interventions of Accidents and Succeſs interpoſed between the Promiſe and the Event, the Birth of Chriſt, any one whereof, if it had miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried, had diſappointed the whole Succeſs: When he was born, what ſtrange Events happen for the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of all the Prophecies concerning him. So in the fulfilling of the Prophecy made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that after four hundred years bondage, his Poſterity ſhould enjoy the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> Gen. 15. ver. 13, 18. What a world of ſtrange Interpoſitions were there, conducing to the fulfilling of it, between that and <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.40. and <hi>Joſhua</hi> 18.1. The Births of <hi>Iſaac, Jacob,</hi> and the Patriarchs; the Dream of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> that caus'd envy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; and that very Envy conducing to the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of his Dream: he is ſold to the <hi>Iſhmaelites;</hi> by them to the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> he is injured and impriſoned; <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Butler is impriſoned in the ſame Priſon, and then dreams; this interpreted by <hi>Joſeph;</hi> the Butler delivered; <hi>Pharaoh</hi> dreams, <hi>Joſeph</hi> is mentioned, and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:50435:83"/>
interprets it, is advanced, furniſheth <hi>Egypt</hi> to be the Magazine of <hi>Africa;</hi> the Famine pincheth <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Family; this lead his Sons to <hi>Egypt; Joſeph</hi> is diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; <hi>Jacob</hi> ſent for, he and his Family; ſixty ſix Perſons go down into <hi>Egypt:</hi> What a Circle is here of the Divine Counſel, managing theſe ſeeming Caſualties, to fulfill that part of the Prophecy to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> That his Seed ſhould be Strangers in a Land that was not theirs! Well, for their Deliverance from thence, they muſt be oppreſſed; that's not enough, the Males muſt be killed; had not this been, <hi>Moſes</hi> had not been expoſed, <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Daughter muſt come juſt to prevent his drowning, and to give the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of a learned Education; this was the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Deliverance. The like we might pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue in the following Paſſages, wherein we may ſee the Wiſe God by his Wiſe Counſel marſhalling the Means, fitting them moſt admirably with Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and ſtrange Conjunctures, for the fulfilling of his purpoſed Ends. And herein is the Excellency of the Scripture, that ſhews us a Hand, ordering and diſpoſing by a moſt Wiſe Counſel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> theſe ſeeming tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuary and diſorderly Paſſages in the World, to moſt admirable and fixed Ends. This is the firſt thing wherein the Wiſdom of this Counſel of God is ſeen in chaining all things one to another, by the very ſame purpoſe whereby he determined the End.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That in the diſpoſing of Means and Ends, <hi>every thing notwithſtanding, moves according to that Law, that he hath given to its particular Being.</hi> We uſually diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the actions or ſucceſſes of things within our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation into three Ranks or Ranges: <hi>viz.</hi> Neceſſary, Voluntary, Contingent:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Neceſſary</hi> Effects are ſuch, as their Cauſes being admitted, have a neceſſary conjunction therewith, or conſequence thereupon, according to the uſual courſe
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:50435:84"/>
of Nature. Such are the Conſequences that riſe upon the motions of the Heavens, as the poſitions of the Planets; the Conſequents that ariſe upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguity or conjunction of the Elements; and divers ſuch things, that hold a conſtant courſe in Nature. Theſe, although the great God may, and ſometimes doth, interrupt by the extraordinary acts of his Power, and to ſhew his Freedom; yet moſt admirably he doth not hinder, but uſeth them to the production of his own moſt ſure Counſels. And this evidenceth the Infinite Wiſdom of the great God, that hath ſo admirably framed his Works and his Counſels, that while the former move uniformly, according to that preſcript Rule and Law, which the God of Nature hath put into them, yet the latter ſhall not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted, but effected by them, though they know it not, nor mean it not. As when we ſee in a curious Watch, the uniform motion of the Spring, ſerving to produce ſeveral artificial motions; as of the hour of the Day, the day of the Month, the age of the Moon, and the like; we commend the Wiſdom of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt, that hath ſo tempered the Spring, that by one uniform motion, it may be uſeful for all theſe; and hath likewiſe ſo directed and managed this natural mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spring, to ſerve exactly thoſe different intellectual motions; and do conclude, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance of this piece of Work was all at one time, otherwiſe it were impoſſible, that every part ſhould hold that order: So when we ſee the natural mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ns of the Creatures, conducing to the production of thoſe rational Ends, which God hath appointed, we may juſtly admire the Wiſdom of God, that while he intends a Purpoſe above the conception or drift of a natural Agent, he bringeth it about without the violation of the Rules or Laws, which he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be conſtant in Nature; and may moſt juſtly
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:50435:84"/>
conclude, That the Law of Neceſſity in the natural Agents, is but the Effect of that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>ry Counſel, that hath predetermined his own Purp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                              <desc>•••</desc>
                           </gap>s by them; and that they are all of a piece, all laid at the ſame time. And from thence grows the ſubſervience of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Agent, in the moſt rigid Law and Rule of his Operation, unto the free Counſels of the great God, that doth moſt ſweetly and infallibly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ffect the latter, without the violation of that Rule, which he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the former. And hence it is, that thoſe Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, which are produced naturally by natural Cauſes, we do and may call Natural and Neceſſary; and yet it excludes not the Counſel of the Divine Will in the production of it: for it is the ſame Counſel, that hath made this neceſſary connexion between the Cauſe and the Effect, that did predetermine the Effect to be produced. Here then is conſpicuous the Wiſdom of God, that while his Creatures, in whom he hath placed an uniform Courſe of Working, fulfil his Will, yet they keep their Law of Unformity and Neceſſity.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Voluntary.</hi> And this is admirable, that whiles Voluntary Agents do moſt neceſſarily fulfil the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of God, yet they do it without the leaſt diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Freedom. The Jews did moſt freely crucifie Chriſt, yet it was by the predeterminate Counſel of God: <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did moſt freely refuſe to let <hi>Iſrael</hi> go, yet Almighty God tells him, for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe had he raiſed him up to ſhew his Power upon him, <hi>Exod.</hi> 9.16. And from hence we may obſerve the reaſon why Almighty God in all times hath uſed rational ways for the reducing of Men to the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his Will, not but that he could, if he pleaſed, force the Wills of all Mankind to what Diſpoſitions or Actions he pleaſed; but that were to infringe that Law, which he at firſt planted in Voluntary Agents.
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:50435:85"/>
Here is the Wiſdom of the great God, his Will ſhall be effected, yet Man's Will not forced: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. <hi>Thy People ſhall be willing in the day of thy Power.</hi> So that the Concluſion is, The Wills of Men are ruled by the Counſel of God for the producing of his Ends, yet without violation of Man's Freedom. This is done by a rational Means. And <hi>the Courſes, that God's Counſel uſeth to work the Will of Men to his Purpoſes,</hi> are moſt uſually theſe,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. By <hi>propounding Rational Objects or Motives</hi> condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to the winning the Will to act thoſe things, that are conducible to the Purpoſe of God. In that one Inſtance, concerning the hardening of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Heart, God had a Purpoſe to be honoured upon <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> in the miraculous delivery of his People: it is propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him, to let the People go; it was a rational oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for him to deny it, for then he ſhould loſe their Work, which was beneficial to him: <hi>Moſes</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm his Embaſſage, caſts down his Rod, it becomes a Serpent; the Magicians, that were of a contrary Counſel to <hi>Moſes,</hi> did the like: this Object hardens the Heart of <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> The like we may ſay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Perſwaſions, Afflictions, and thoſe other Diſpenſations of the Divine Will brought upon a Man <hi>in ictu opportuno.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. By giving and <hi>adminiſtring Extraordinary Aids</hi> and Inlightenings, ſtrengthening the Faculties of the Soul.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. By <hi>withdrawing the ordinary Supplies</hi> and concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of God's Aſſiſtance. We are to know, that as the Being of all things is from God, ſo the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſupportation of all things in their ſeveral Powers and Activities, is from him: and if he withdraw his Concurrence and Aſſiſtance, our Wills will move freely, but to other objects, or in another manner, than they did when aſſiſted by him.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="133" facs="tcp:50435:85"/>Now theſe we muſt not imagine to be Expedients or Helps <hi>pro re nata,</hi> as it happens among us, that when a thing beyond our expectation is gone beyond our maſtery, then to deviſe ſome helps to reclaim it, or allay it: But the whole Plat-form of all and every Circumſtance was laid and ſet by the Purpoſe of God, before the being of any thing. Man ſhall work freely, yet I will draw out that Freedom of his into theſe and theſe actions, by this and that rational means: ſupply or ſubduction of my aid, of his Will, ſhall not elude or defeat my Counſel; nor yet the fulfilling of that Counſel violate the Freedom of that Will, which I purpoſe to allow him.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>Contingent</hi> Effects; which are ſuch as ariſe from the conjuncture of ſeveral Cauſes not ſubordinate one to the other: and this caſual conjuncture of Cauſes, denominates the Event neither Voluntary nor Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, although it perchance ariſe from Cauſes of both or either Nature: but theſe having no natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction or connexion one with the other, the Event, that ariſeth upon this conjuncture, is Caſual or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent: And this Conſideration leads us to the third thing, wherein the Wiſdom of this Counſel is emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, <hi>viz.</hi>
                        </p>

And this conſiſts in the drawing out of the ſeveral activities and cauſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of things, at ſuch a time and ſuch a diſtance, as may be ſubſervient to the Effect; wherein, though the Cauſes apart perhaps, move ſimply according to their Nature, yet the meddling and mingling of them together, is a clear Evidence of the Unity and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of that Counſel, by which they are governed.

an Effect, that neither of them did foreſee, or intend, but only the God that guided them.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. It is an Active and <hi>Irreſiſtible</hi> Counſel. This is evident, by what hath been before obſerved, <hi>viz.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the cauſe and meaſure of the being and power of every thing without it: it is therefore impoſſible to be reſiſted, becauſe that ſtrength, that any thing hath, it hath meerly by the efficacy of this Purpoſe of God. Although in the Divine Nature, there is no difference in the Power or Act of his Underſtanding and Will, yet for our Conceptions ſake, they are propounded under a different Notion: his Purpoſe or Counſel is referred immediately to his Will, and is not only a Foreknowledge of what ſhall be, but hath an operative influence into the being and operations of all things: His Preſcience or Foreknowledge, we conceive as an act of his Underſtanding, by which he actually knows whatſoever ſhall be: This Preſcience is not an objective impreſſion of the things themſelves upon the Divine Underſtanding, for that were to ſuppoſe a kind of Paſſibility, which is incompetible to the Divine Perfection, and ſuppoſeth a kind of Priority in Nature of the Object to the Power, and a kind of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance of the Act upon it: But as all things have their Being by the Act of the Divine Will or Purpoſe, ſo in that Purpoſe of his, he ſees the things purpoſed; and it is impoſſible to ſever the act of his Purpoſe, from the act of his Knowledge, of the things pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, though notionally they differ.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. It is an <hi>

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:50435:87"/>
neceſſarily make an utter incertainty in the whole di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſation of the World, and ſo diſappoint his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. It is moſt evident, that the greateſt Events in the World have depended upon a <hi>Compages</hi> and Conca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                           </gap>nation of ſeveral Interventions, that in themſelves have been moſt inconſiderable, which if they had not been, it had been impoſſible the Event, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo eminent, could have happened: <hi>David</hi> raiſed to be king of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> a thing eminently in the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of God, yet had he not been ſent to the Army with the Proviſions for his Brothers, the means of his Advancement, and conſequently the Advancement it ſelf had been diſappointed. If therefore the ſame Counſel, which had determined his being King, had not determined his Meſſage to the Army, that great Effect had been utterly without the determination of the Divine Providence: for that, which <hi>de facto</hi> was the neceſſary Concurrent to his Advancement, being caſual, and not within the care of Providence, ſo muſt all the dependances that had been upon it. And the ſame we muſt conclude in all the actions of Voluntary Agents. Two <hi>Difficulties</hi> occur:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. How the Predetermination of the Acts of Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Agents can conſiſt with the Liberty of the Will?</p>
                        <p n="2">2. How the Predetermination of the Sinful Acts of Voluntary Agents can conſiſt with the Juſtice or Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of God?</p>
                        <p>Touching the <hi>former,</hi> we conclude,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That although Almighty God hath been pleaſed to give Voluntary Agents a Liberty of Will, yet he may moſt juſtly of his abſolute Power, interrupt that freedom when, and in what he pleaſeth. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, He is abſolute and unlimitted Lord of his Creature; and in as much as the Creature can have no Being, but by his Will, he cannot claim any Right,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:50435:87"/>
but what conſiſts with his Maker's Will: if he wills an interruption of that courſe, which he hath regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly ſettled, that interruption is as juſt, as that courſe which he interrupteth: for both equally depend upon the ſame Will.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That though he may moſt juſtly, if he pleaſe, alter that courſe, which he hath ſettled in Natural or Voluntary Agents; yet ſuch is his Will, that he doth it not, but hath been pleaſed to hold that courſe in Natural, but eſpecially Voluntary Agents, that they move according to that Liberty, with which he hath endowed them.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. That nevertheleſs, all the voluntary actions of Men fall under the Predetermination of his Counſel: otherwiſe it were impoſſible, but that the World ſhould be governed at random, the contrary whereof is moſt clearly evidenced by daily obſervation, and ſeveral paſſages of the Holy Scripture, and by what hath been before obſerved.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. It is evident, that this Predetermination of the Divine Counſel is without any Violation of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of a free ſubordinate Agent; becauſe the Action predetermined is elicited by ſuch means, as at once conſiſteth with the infallibility of Divine Providence, and the nature of the Agent. The great motive and object of all the actions and averſions of Men is Good and Evil: the great means whereby Men are carried unto theſe actions or averſions, are Convictions of the Underſtanding, ariſing from the union of theſe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to the Underſtanding; the act of the rational Appetite or Will following that Conviction, if not perturbed; the Paſſions or Affections partly managed by the command of the Will, partly by the temper and conſtitution of the Body. And certainly, if one Man had an exact knowledge of the frame, temper, and conſtitution of another Man; and had power to
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:50435:88"/>
apply his Object ſo exactly to his Underſtanding and Affections: as to meet with them exactly; and could diſcover the motions of the Soul upon that Object propoſed, and could apply to every oppoſition a ſuitable anſwer or qualification; this Man might eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly predetermine what the other ſhould do, and yet in drawing out that action, no way injure his Liberty. How much more can the Infinite and Omnipotent God, who put that Liberty, Underſtanding, and Affections in Man, poſitively predetermine ſuch an act to be done, and yet draw out that act by ſuch means by him decr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                           </gap>ty of his Will; the freedom of the action being no leſs predetermined, than the action it ſelf: Eſpecially, if we conſider the Power of this God, in adding or withdrawing of the extrinſecal Helps and Concurrences of his own immediate Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which have a more intimate and powerful ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration upon the Soul, than barely objective, which yet hurts not, nor hinders the intrinſecal Freedom of the act of the Will.</p>

                        <p n="1">1. A <hi>Law given:</hi> for where there is no Law, there can be no Tranſgreſſion.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. A <hi>V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>y Agent,</hi> to whom this Law is given; for it is impoſſible, that any thing can be capable of a Law properly, but a voluntary Agent; becauſe the proper Effect of a Law, is to put an extrinſecal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint Under a Penalty upon that which hath choice to obey it, or not. Natural Agents, though they
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:50435:88"/>
move according to a Rule, the interruption whereof, cauſeth a Deformity, yet they move not by a Law; and therefore not capable of Sin.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. An <hi>Authority</hi> in him, that gives the Law, to give it to the Will. A Man, that hath an extrinſecal Power over me without my conſent, may give a Law to me, and exact the Obedience of it; but the Violation of this Law is no ſin, becauſe he hath no power upon my Will, but God hath a power to command my Will, and exact Obedience of it. Hence it is, that there can be no Sin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but againſt God, becauſe all <hi>Obligation</hi> is reductive only to him.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. A <hi>Violation</hi> of that Law, by the act of the Will: and herein we have two things:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The Subject denominated: that is the Action, which preciſely conſidered, cannot be ſinful; but it is therefore ſinful, becauſe it is the product of my Will, contrary to this Law. Hence it is, that no action that is enforced, can be ſaid to be ſinful: and every evil action hath ſo much of ſin in it, as it hath of Will; and doth receive degrees of Evil, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the meaſure of Conſent and Concurrence of the Will. And hence it is, that the Act of the Will againſt that Law, is equally ſin, as if it had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded into act; which was that moſt rational and clear Doctrine of our Saviour.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The thing denominating that action ſinful: it is the Obliquity of the act of the Will; for the laſt act of the Will, which preceeded the action, is the Sin; and the action divided from that act of the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is not, nor can be ſinful: It is therefore called a ſinful action, becauſe it is the fruit or expreſſion of an act of the Will, moving contrary to this Law of God. And by this it is evident, that the Sin is not inherent in the external action produced by the Will, but in
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:50435:89"/>
the Will it ſelf: and that the Sin hath a pre-exiſtence, ſuch as it is in the Conſent of the Will, before the action is produced: And according to the meaſure of the freeneſs and fulneſs of that Conſent is the meaſure of the Sin, and not according to the action; though it be regularly true, that that conſent of the Will, that is ſtrongeſt, produceth moſt ordinarily an action. Hence it is, that an action contrary to the Command of God, produced either through Incogitancy, Fear, Surprize, Paſſion, is not ſo great a ſin, as a deliberate, ſtudied, reſolved Sin, though in truth it be not produced into act, by reaſon of ſome extrinſecal impediment: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is a fuller Conſent of the Will in the latter, than in the former.</p>
                        <p>Theſe things being premiſed, we may <hi>conclude,</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. God's Counſel doth not predetermine the Will to any evil: for although it is true, the Obligation of a Law is the neceſſary Antecedent of every Sin, and it is impoſſible, that the Laws, which God gives to man, do bind the Law-giver, yet this is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with his Purity, Truth, and Juſtice: Inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with his Purity; for certainly there is an intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecal Juſtice and Holineſs in the Law of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he cannot cauſe the Violation: Inconſiſtent with his Truth; the Will of his Counſel never croſſeth the Will of his Command: Inconſiſtent with his Juſtice, to require an Obedience to that Law, whereof he doth neceſſitate the breach; And in this caſe prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminating the Action by way of neceſſitating the Will, and to predetermine the Obliquity, differs little.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Much leſs doth he infuſe Obliquity or Evil into the Will, to ſerve the Series of his Counſels.</p>
                        <p>But then it ſeems the Evil Actions of Men are out of the Counſel of God; or God muſt take up new Counſels upon the Viſion, or at leaſt Previſion, of the actions of Men. No: But here we muſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:50435:89"/>
what hath been before premiſed, that here is ſeen the great Juſtice and Wiſdom of this Counſel, that it puts nothing off from that manner of opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wherewith the God of Nature hath endued it. Thus he draws out infallibly the action of a free Agent, even in things ſinful, and yet the Will moves freely in what it doth, and conſequently, owes that Sin to it ſelf: The Counſel of God is active in theſe particulars:</p>

before they are taken: Such are the outward diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of his Providence in Education, Affliction, Proſperity, the Preaching of his Word, Advice of Friends<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> giving external Allays to the humours of the Body: Theſe and the like, God lends to the Sons of Men, and may take them again when he will. And as he hath ſuch outward operations, ſo without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, ſuch is the Vicinity of God to our Souls, that there are Secret Inward Perſwaſions ſent in by the Power of God to our Souls, which as they do not violate the Liberty of our Wills, but direct them, ſo they are not due to the Creature <hi>debito juſtitiae,</hi> and may be withdrawn without injuſtice.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of the Execution of the Eternal Counſel of God, in his Works of Creation and Providence.</head>
                        <p>NOW we come to conſider the <hi>Execution of that Counſel</hi> in thoſe two greater tranſient Acts, <hi>viz.</hi> Creation and Providence:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Touching <hi>the Creation.</hi> This we conſider in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and particularly as concerning Man: In general, we reſolve the work of Creation into <hi>three parts.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. The <hi>original production of all things out of nothing.</hi> This is ſimply Creation <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.1. <hi>In the beginning God created the Heaven, and the Earth. (God Created:)</hi> This is the greateſt conceptible motion, viz. <hi>à non eſſe ad eſſe;</hi> and though it be an act of Faith to believe it, becauſe related, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.3. yet it is a concluſion of Reaſon to know it, as it appears by what hath been before obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved concerning the impoſſibility to have any eternal ſubſiſtence but one: And this truth, though it be dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible by neceſſity of Reaſon, if a God be once admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, yet ſo infinite is the diſtance between Nothing and a Being, that divers of the acuteſt Naturaliſts were ignorant of it; the ignorance of which Principle cauſed many of their abſurd and unintelligible Poſitions and Superſtructions, to ſupply thoſe difficulties, which by this only Truth are avoided, as concerning the Firſt Matter, the Eductions of Forms out of the power of it, by I know not what Agents. <hi>(God created:)</hi> This infinite Motion could only proceed from an infinite Power, who by the mere act of his Will, conſtitutes ſomething out of nothing. <hi>(In the beginning:)</hi> Time could not be, before there were ſomething that had
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:50435:92"/>
ſucceſſion of Being, for it is the meaſure of a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Being; and therefore the beginning of created Beings, muſt needs be the beginning of Time, and Creation was the beginning of created Beings. <hi>(The Heavens and the Earth:)</hi> The indigeſted matter of the Heavens and the Earth.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The <hi>dividing and ordering of this Maſs;</hi> calling out the particular Subſiſtences, and furniſhing of them with forms and qualities. This was ſubſequent to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Matter: and we find the Manner of this production in two Expreſſions:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The motion of the Spirit of God upon the face of the Waters; Verſ. 2. containing an act of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power, whereby he fitted every thing to be ready for his call: for though by the ſame inſtantaneous act, the Divine Power could in the firſt inſtant of Creation have put things in their ſeveral Beings, yet it was his Will to work ſucceſſively, firſt creating the Matter, then breathing upon it, and fitting this confuſed ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance with aptitude for the things to be thereout pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The Word of Command: <hi>Let there be Light,</hi> &amp;c. in the ſeveral works of the ſix days. And here we may obſerve the admirable Wiſdom of God, as in divers particulars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo eſpecially in theſe: 1. In the <hi>Order</hi> of the creating particular Creatures, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding 1. to the finiſhing of Fundamentals, then to Superſtructions, though of more curioſity and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, yet more dependant upon thoſe of the firſt creation: 2. in the <hi>Variety</hi> of the Creatures, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodating them with Qualities, and Conveniences ſuitable to their Kinds, whereby one doth not deſire to encroach upon the Conveniences of the other's Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence: For an Inſtance, the Beaſts, Fiſhes, Fowl, endued with Appetites ſuitable to their Being, yet the ſeveral Kinds affecting ſeveral Nouriſhments, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:50435:92"/>
places of Reſidence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Herbs of contrary qualities, drawing ſeveral Nouriſhments of ſeveral Natures, even from the ſame Clod of Earth.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. In the <hi>Poſition and Situation</hi> of created Beings, both for Beauty, and Convenience, ſo that the Wit of the moſt envious Atheiſt, cannot imagine how the Elements, the Heavens, the ſeveral Creatures could be more beautifully, or uſefully placed: every thing ſerves to accommodate and fit the other, and ſpeaks the Wiſdom and Goodneſs of the Creator: the Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Earth, the Water, the Air, with exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite Convenience, that they may meet for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of mixt, and the ſubſiſtence of animate Creatures: The Earth and other Bodies have depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon the power and influence of the Sun and Heavens; each is fitted with a Figure, and the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens with a Motion, that may with admirable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience diſpenſe that Influence: the variety of Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, depending upon the ecliptical motion of the Sun, giving variety to the Creature, and intermiſſions to the Earth, whereby ſhe may recover ſtrength in the Winter, for the ſupply of the Summer: The very imprefect Creatures, the Rain, the Winds, Snow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of admirable uſe for the Earth, Air, and Water: The Elements ſo placed and ordered, that whiles their contrary motions and qualities of Rarety and Denſity, preſerve the extremity of their contrary active quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties from meeting, yet their Vicinity is ſuch, that one allays the violence of the other, and ſo are in a fit po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition and temper for production of mixt Bodies.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The <hi>planting in every thing a radical Activity and Cauſality,</hi> by which it moves. This is by Virtue of that Word of the Power of God: the very Multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Creature, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.22. The warming of our Garments by the South Wind, <hi>Job</hi> 27.17. The Nouriſhment that comes from our Bread, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.3.
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:50435:93"/>
is due to this Word of Command and Benediction, that the Lord at firſt ſpoke to the Creature.</p>
                        <p>Now concerning the particular Creation <hi>of Man;</hi> not to enter into the conſideration of the manner of his Creation, his Eſſentials, the Body, the Soul, or the nature of either; but we ſhall enquire, What is meant by the Likeneſs or Image of God? There was a twofold <hi>Image of God:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Eſſential, viz.</hi> A participation in his very Eſſence, of a Conformity to the Divine Nature, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in three particulars:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That he had an Immortal Soul: this is that which, <hi>Wiſdom</hi> 2.23. is called the Image of his Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity:</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That he was an Intellectual Being:</p>
                        <p n="3">3. That he was a Free Agent.</p>
                        <p>Theſe, being eſſential to Man, were not loſt by him: and for this reaſon, God required the ſame ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity againſt Murder, as if Man had never fallen, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.6. <hi>For in the Image of God made he Man.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. An <hi>Accidental</hi> Image, which conſiſted in an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventitious Perfection, which God added to Man.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Dominion, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26. <hi>And let them have Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>So God created Man in his own Image.</hi> The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, which he gave to him, made him reſemble God: and hence it is, that thoſe that have power of Command, are called Gods, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.17. <hi>And thou ſhalt be to him inſtead of God. Pſal.</hi> 82.6. <hi>I have ſaid ye are gods.</hi> Vid. <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.2. This Dominion conſiſted not only in his Power to inforce his Commands by the advantages of Wit and Strength above other Creatures, but likewiſe in a Subjection in the Creatures to his Dominion.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. An incorruptible Union between the Body and the Soul, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. <hi>The day that thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely die.</hi> Hence <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. the Apoſtle concludes
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:50435:93"/>
Death the fruit of Sin. This might have been either by reaſon of the excellence of his natural Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; or by ſupplying it with ſpecial Aſſiſtance, by which means, the Lives of the Fathers before the Flood, had ſo long a duration; or by aſſuming of him into Heaven, without any diſſolution of Soul and Body, as was <hi>Enoch,</hi> Gen. 5.24.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. A filling of the Intellectual Faculty with the Light and Knowledge of all things, eſpecially of his Maker. And herein conſiſted his high degree of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. But as the Object, or the Union of the Object to the Faculty, is not of the Eſſence of that Intellectual Nature, wherein that Faculty reſides, but may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved without any eſſential change, ſo was this: and that herein conſiſted the Image of God, appears by <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.10. The Renovation by Chriſt, which is <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed in knowledge after the Image of him that created him.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. Holineſs, or Conformity of the Will to the Will of God. This appears likewiſe by the ſtate of Renovation, <hi>Epeſ.</hi> 4.24. <hi>Put on the New Man, which after God is created in Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs;</hi> which, as it preſuppoſeth a true Knowledge of the Will of God, ſo it was a free choice of Obedience to it. This was not eſſential to the Will, becauſe the Will was eſſentially Free, but had been neceſſary to the Will, in caſe the Underſtanding had not been abuſed.</p>

                        <p>Concerning the eſtate of Man <hi>before the Fall,</hi> or ſin of Adam; we have already examined certain Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, that are conducible to this point, <hi>viz.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. That God did appoint Man to ſome End, or Good, anſwerable to the conſtitution and value of his Nature; and this is his Happineſs.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That this Good muſt therefore be an Infinite, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal, Intelligible Good; otherwiſe it could not be anſwerable to the Nature of Man.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. That there is not, nor can be, any ſuch Good but only God.</p>
                        <p n="4">
                           <pb n="151" facs="tcp:50435:94"/>4. That the Actual Enjoyment of this Good is by the Union of the Soul to God, and the Communion of God to the Soul.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. That the only Means of attaining this Union and Communion muſt needs be ſuch, and ſuch only, as the Will of God pleaſeth to appoint.</p>
                        <p>We ſhall now deſcend to theſe two particular <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries,</hi> viz.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. What was that great <hi>End or Happineſs,</hi> which Man did, or might enjoy in his created condition?</p>
                        <p n="2">2. What was the <hi>Means,</hi> whereby to attain and keep that Happineſs?</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Concerning the former, <hi>viz.</hi> What was <hi>Man's Happineſs in his Creation?</hi> we ſhall conſider him in thoſe three degrees of Living which he had:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. As a <hi>Vegetable</hi> Creature; an exact Conſtitution and temper of Body, which though naturally cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, yet by the interpoſition of the Divine Power, not ſubject to corruption: thoſe things that were for his uſe and ſuſtentation, the Air, the Water, the Fruits of the Earth, moſt exactly conducible to the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuating of his Life without Pain or Sickneſs.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. As a <hi>Senſible</hi> Creature; Exquiſiteneſs of Senſe, and receptive of whatſoever the Creature could af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford conducing to his Uſe or Delight; and the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture likewiſe fitted for the ſupply of thoſe Senſes, every Herb given him for Food, all the Creatures came to him to receive their Names, he had Dominion over them, a moſt pleaſant Garden planted by God himſelf for his Habitation, with a Tree of Immortality in it:</p>
                        <p n="3">3. As a <hi>Rational</hi> Creature.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. A moſt juſt and ſweet Subordination of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Faculties to the ſuperiour, the ſenſitive Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, the Paſſions, and Motions of the Spirits.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. A moſt exact fitneſs and perfection of thoſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans of the Body, which are neceſſary for the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:50435:95"/>
of the Faculties of the Soul; and a perfect and juſt Union of the Body and Soul, whereby the Soul might clearly and perfectly exerciſe all her Faculties.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Which is the height of all the reſt, fitting of thoſe Faculties with the moſt perfect and ſuitable Object, even God himſelf: for all Faculties or Powers receive their perfection by their Objects: to have an Underſtanding as comprehenſive as Heaven, to have a Will of as vaſt Deſires as infinitude it ſelf, and not to have an Object ſuitable to either, were a greater Unhappineſs than to want the Faculties. In the Creation therefore, God filled the Underſtanding with the ſight and knowledge of Himſelf, of his Majeſty, Glory, Bounty, Goodneſs; with the knowledge of his Will and Mind concerning Man; with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his Works, and of his Workings. This could not chuſe but work in the Mind of Man an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable returns to the nature of this Object.</p>
                        <p>He is fully conceived to be the higheſt and moſt ſupream Good, and therefore muſt needs take up the higheſt and choiceſt Deſires to attain and keep him: God is pleaſed to communicate himſelf to theſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, his acceptation of them, and intimate Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Love to his Creature: This as it is the higheſt Happineſs, and the Reſt of the Creature, ſo it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not chuſe but ingage the Soul to return Love and Obedience to the Will of his God, eſpecially when all thoſe Engagements to Obedience are likewiſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the Soul, that it owes its Being to him, that his will is moſt righteous and fit to be obeyed. And this Obedience ariſing from theſe Principles of Love to God, as it was without all Hypocriſie, ſo it was without all pain and tediouſneſs; for it did ariſe from an inward and active Principle, and was acted by moſt obedient and active Faculties: Man took no leſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in his Obedience, which was the fruit of his
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:50435:95"/>
Love and Duty to his Maker, than he did in the knowledge of the Beauty and Goodneſs of his Maker, which was the cauſe of that Love and Duty. And as the actings of the natural Appetite upon a proper and ſeaſonable Object, when they exceed not their proportion, are delightful; ſo the actings of the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Appetite, conſiſting in Love and Obedience to God, wherein they could not exceed their juſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, were the delight of the Soul: his Holineſs, conſiſting in the returns to his Maker of Love and Obedience, and the Goodneſs of his God, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating himſelf and his favour, exciting and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting thoſe returns, did both conduce to the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of his Bleſſedneſs. All this, as it was derived from the Bleſſing of God, 1 <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. ſo it ended in the Perfection of the Creature: <hi>And God ſaw all that he had made, and behold it was very Good.</hi> Ib. Ver. 31.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The <hi>Means</hi> whereby he attained, or rather pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved this ſtate of Happineſs, which was in effect congenite with (though not eſſential to) his Being. This was only <hi>Obedience</hi> to the Will of his Maker. In all inferiour Creatures, we ſee a kind of inclination or inſtinct to follow the Rule of their Nature: This conducts them to that degree of Felicity and Beauty, which is commenſurate to their Nature: herein, though they follow the Will of their Creator, in the Law of their Creation, it is not properly <hi>Obedience,</hi> nor that inſtinct properly <hi>a Law:</hi> the latter is only given, and the former only performed, by ſuch a Creature as hath Liberty and Choice, and conſequently, Knowledge and Underſtanding, without which it is impoſſible to have the other. Man alone of all viſible Creatures, is endued with both, and ſo fitted to receive a Law, and to obey it: Being thus fitted, he hath a double ingagement of Obedience, <hi>viz.</hi> of Duty and of Profit: 1. Of Duty: he received his Being from his Maker,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:50435:96"/>
and that Being furniſhed with Happineſs: This is an infinite and boundleſs engagement of Duty, even to the utmoſt of his Being. 2. Of Profit or Advantage: this ſtock of Happineſs, that was but now freely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon him, is put into his hands under this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, if he break his Condition, he forfeits, and that moſt juſtly, his Happineſs. But yet if this Law were beyond the capacity of his Nature, then there might be ſome excuſe of his Diſobedience: But as this Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs was fully commenſurate to his Nature, ſo was this Law, which was the ſubject of his Obedience. We ſhall therefore conſider theſe three things:
<list>
                              <item>1. What was the Law of Man's Creation?</item>
                              <item>2. Whence the Obligation of it?</item>
                              <item>3. What the Sanction or Penalty?</item>
                           </list>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. What <hi>the Law</hi> was? Obedience was the Duty of Man to the Will of his Creator: the Law was the Specification of that Will, in this or that particular Command, or Prohibition: The Laws that God gave to Man therefore were of two kinds:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Such as did bear a kind of proportion or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience to the Nature of Man: ſuch are all thoſe moral Dictates, which we call Laws of Nature, as keeping of Faith, worſhipping God; and moſt, if not all thoſe Precepts in the Decalogue, are but Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of theſe Laws. Theſe, though they have no Obligation, but by the Command of God, yet they have a kind of Congruity with the very Nature of Man.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Such as though they have their original Juſtice of Obligation upon the ſame ground as the former hath, <hi>viz.</hi> The ſubordination of the rational Creature to the Will of God, yet <hi>in hoc individuo,</hi> there doth not appear
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:50435:96"/>
that Congruity of Nature of Man with this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: ſuch was the Command of forbearing the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden Fruit: and anſwerable to this, in all times, God hath been pleaſed to give Commands of theſe two ſeveral kinds, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.14. At the ſame time God forbids Murder, which holds Congruity with Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature; and eating of Blood, which doth not appear to hold ſuch Congruity, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.2. to <hi>Abraham, Walk before me, and be perfect,</hi> which is a Rule of natural Juſtice; and a Command of Circumciſion, the reaſon whereof doth not ſo naturally appear; ſo to the <hi>Jews,</hi> not only the Moral Law, but divers Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Rites, which have no ſuch neceſſary confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to Reaſon. The reaſon of this, and why the firſt Man's Obedience was tried upon this Precept, was becauſe that in the Obedience to ſuch a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, is given the cleareſt and moſt free Obedience to God; for we hereby acknowledge his Freedom to command what he pleaſeth, and our juſt Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to obey what he commands, meerly becauſe he commands.</p>
                        <p>Now becauſe it is impoſſible, that any Law can bind, unleſs it hath ſome <hi>Promulgation</hi> or diſcovery from him that gives it, or ſomewhat equivolent unto it, we are to conſider, How theſe Laws came to be publiſhed? As for the latter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is moſt certain and clear, that it was by expreſs injunction from God. <hi>And the Lord God commanded Man, ſaying,</hi> &amp;c. Whether this was by an audible Voice, or by an immediate infuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the knowledge of it into the Mind, it will not be material to enquire: But certain it is, that in as much as the Obligation of this Precept doth not ariſe from any intrinſecal conformity of the thing to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, there was an expreſs injunction and command of God in it. But as touching the former, though they were diſcovered to Man, to be the Will
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:50435:97"/>
of God, yet they did hold a kind of intrinſecal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion and conformity to the very Nature of Men. And hence it is, that though by the Fall, a general deficiency was in Man, yet the tracks and foot-ſteps of thoſe Laws remain in his very conſtitution. Though this cannot be the cauſe of their Obligation, yet que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſs, this was part of the means of their Publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Man, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14. <hi>The Gentiles not having the Law, do by nature the things contained in the Law.</hi> And although much were due to Education, and Tradition, and the courſe of God's Providence in propagating the Knowledge of the Moral Law, yet ſuch a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence it hath with the nature and uſe of Men, that when they once come to an actual exerciſe of right Reaſon, they have in all ſucceſſions of times and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces taken up thoſe Laws of Nature, which we call the Moral Law, or the moſt parts of them.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Touching <hi>the-Obligation</hi> of theſe Laws, it was <hi>twofold:</hi> 1. From the Injunction and <hi>Command of God,</hi> who had an Univerſal, Infinite, and Unlimited Power over his Creature, and might moſt juſtly require his Obedience. And into this Power of God, together with his actual Command or Prohibition, is all the Obligation of all Laws, whether Natural or Poſitive, and of all inferiour Laws, Compacts, or Agreements, to be reſolved. And without the due conſideration of this, Mankind is looſe. Though the natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity of the Moral Law to the Nature of Man might be the means of its Publication, it is the Command of God, that is, and ever was, the cauſe of its Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. From the <hi>Compact</hi> and Stipulation <hi>of Man.</hi> God put into Man's hands a ſtock both of Bleſſedneſs and Liberty; and though he might have commanded his Creature, and it had bound eternally, yet, to add the greater engagement upon him, he enters into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:50435:97"/>
with him, concerning his Obedience. Hence it is called the Covenant of Works. And in all enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing times, when it pleaſed God to reinforce the Law of Nature or Obedience, he doth it by way of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact or Covenant, as well as Command; to add ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Obligation as well of Contract as Duty. And from this grew the Univerſality of the Guilt that was contracted by Diſobedience: <hi>Adam</hi> covenanted for him and his Poſterity, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19. As the Obedience of Chriſt is effectual for his Seed, by way of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract and Stipulation with God the Father; ſo was the Diſobedience of <hi>Adam</hi> binding upon his Seed, partly by reaſon of his Contract and Stipulation; and ſo they are made there parallel. <hi>Sed de hoc infra.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. The <hi>Sanction</hi> of the Law given to <hi>Adam.</hi> The Violation of any Law given by him, that hath Power, contracts Guilt, that is, Obligation to Puniſhment: the meaſure of this Puniſhment is that Sanction, which God did put upon the Violation of this Law, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. <hi>In the day thou eateſt, thou ſhalt ſurely die:</hi> Herein are four <hi>Particulars:</hi> 1. The Offence, eating the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden Fruit; 2. The Puniſhment, Death; 3. The Time of the inflicting of it, in the day. 4. The Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of it, thou ſhalt die, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Touching the firſt: The thing ſpecially prohibited, was eating the forbidden Fruit; but that which was in the Mind of God to enjoyn, was Obedience to his Command: and although this particular was by God made the Experiment of Man's Obedience, yet que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſs, the ſame Injunction, and under the ſame Penalty, was given to Men, touching thoſe other Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Dictates, which were received, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. which loſt not their Obligation by the Fall of Man, no more than if he had continued in his Integrity, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.7. <hi>If thou doſt not well, Sin lieth at the door:</hi> and Verſe 14. <hi>Cain</hi> acknowledgeth Death to be the conſequent of
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:50435:98"/>
that Guilt, which he contracted by his Murder, <hi>Every one that findeth me ſhall ſlay me:</hi> The like of <hi>Lamech, Verſe</hi> 23. For the Formality of any Sin, as hath been before obſerved, conſiſteth in the diſobedience of the Will to the Command of God: <hi>By one Mans diſobedience ſin entred into the World.</hi> And as the object of Mans obedience was whatſoever God had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, ſo the diſobedience to any one Command had contracted the like Guilt, and were under the like Penalty as this, though this being purely a poſitive Command, wherein only the Obedience or Diſobedience of Man could be ſeen, was that which is here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, becauſe that wherein he offended.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Thou ſhalt die: God made not Death,</hi> ſaith the wiſe Man, <hi>Wiſd.</hi> 1.14. but, <hi>Death entred into the world by ſin,</hi> Rom. 5.12. It <hi>imports three things:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. A loſs or looſning of that ſtrictneſs of Union which was between the Body and Soul, or temporal immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality. This is the Argument that the Apoſtle makes, that from the time of <hi>Adam</hi>'s tranſgreſſion till <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſin was in the World, becauſe Death reigned all that while: and in the place before mentioned, till ſin the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Death was not upon the Earth: This im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality was not eſſential to the Nature of man, but was freely ſuper-added to it by the Divine Will upon thoſe terms of Obedience; and he that gave it might with all imaginable Juſtice give it upon what terms he pleaſeth; and he doth it upon terms of Obedience; Obedience to himſelf, which but even now gave Man his Being, and might juſtly exact the utmoſt of his Being; Obedience to a Law moſt poſſible, eaſie, and quadrate to the Powers and Aids given to man; Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience ingaged by a world of Bleſſedneſs attending it, and an inevitable loſs enſuing the breach of it: This was his Vegetable loſs.</p>
                        <p n="2">
                           <pb n="159" facs="tcp:50435:98"/>2. A loſs of that Happineſs, which accompanied this immortal Being, in reſpect of his Senſes, <hi>viz.</hi> an uninterrupted ſtream of Pleaſure and Contentment, and inſtead thereof Shame, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.7. Pain, and Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, <hi>Verſe</hi> 26. Sorrow, <hi>Verſe</hi> 17. anxious and painful Labour, <hi>Verſe</hi> 19. a Curſe upon the Earth, <hi>Verſe</hi> 17. A loſs of <hi>Eden, Verſe</hi> 23.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The withdrawing and ſtopping of that ſtream of Light and Love, that paſſed between God and the Soul of man; which filled his reaſonable faculties brimful of Happineſs and Contentment; and inſtead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, in the underſtanding, darkneſs, diſtractedneſs, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued motion to know, and yet for want of Light not knowing what to purſue, and therefore purſuing trifles and follies: In the Will, loſs of the Good that it before injoyed, yet a craving Appetite after ſomewhat, but it knows not what; and to ſatisfie this unſatiable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire take<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> in whatſoever the Suggeſtions of the World, Fleſh and the Devil offers, fills it ſelf with Vanity, and then with Vexation: In the Affections, eſpecially our Love, it hath loſt what did take up the whole Vigour and Comprehenſion of it, and what it loved it injoyed; but now raves and boils like the Sea after Follies and changeable and unſatisfying purſuits: The Conſcience, that Chamber of the Soul, wherein the beams of the Light and Favour of the Creator, and of the Love and Duty of the Creature, met as it were in the point or angle of reflection, and carried thoſe comfortable Meſſages of Sincerity and Obedience of the Soul to God, and delight and acceptance from God, to the Soul, is now become the Chamber of Death, and, like the Spleen to the Body, the receptacle of the Melancholy and ſad Convictions of a guilty and ungrateful Soul, and of an injured and revenging God, and pre-appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of farther Miſery: But if, in the midſt of Millions of Miſeries, he could ſee his Creator inviting
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:50435:99"/>
him to dependance and recumbance upon him, the Miſeries were nothing, they are born by his ſtrength upon whom he leans: But when the Lord of Heaven ſhall give him a trembling Heart, and failing of Eyes, and Sorrow of mind, as in that moſt lively Expreſſion he threatens the <hi>Jews, Deut.</hi> 28.65, 66, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and when he comes to his Creator, the laſt and ſupreme refuge of Man, God himſelf ſhall write bitter things againſt him, and eternally reject him. Here is the Death of Deaths: This, and much more than this, is included in that Sanction, <hi>Thou ſhalt ſurely die.</hi> And this appears to be a moſt juſt and righteous Sanction.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>Thou:</hi> But we are taught, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. <hi>By one Man ſin entred into the World, and Death by ſin, ſo Death paſſed upon all Men, for that all have ſinned:</hi> Here it is <hi>inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. Whether <hi>the Guilt of</hi> Adam<hi>'s</hi> ſin did <hi>extend</hi> farther than <hi>Adam's</hi> Perſon? and by what means or Rule of Juſtice that came to paſs?</p>
                        <p>We muſt conclude <hi>in</hi> Adam <hi>all ſinned,</hi> Rom. 5.19. <hi>By one Mans diſobedience many were made Sinners;</hi> and as Sin paſſed over all, ſo Death paſſed over all. And this the Apoſtle uſeth as the Argument of the Univerſality of ſin, in the ſame place; and, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.22. <hi>For as in Adam all died, ſo in Chriſt all ſhall be made alive.</hi> The ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> was the ſin of his Poſterity by a double Means:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. For that he contracted with God for him and his Poſterity; and as in Nature including, ſo in Law perſonating them all. And in this reſpect, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.14. he is ſtiled <hi>the Figure of him that was to come:</hi> As Chriſt contracted for his Seed by Faith, ſo <hi>Adam</hi> contracted for his Seed by Nature. It is true, regularly the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal ſin of the Father, or of any Perſon, is not char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon his Poſterity: <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.20. <hi>The Soul that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth it ſhall die; the Son ſhall not bear the iniquity of the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:50435:99"/>
Father;</hi> conform to that Law of God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 24.16. <hi>The Children ſhall not be put to Death for the Father:</hi> But yet by way of Covenant or Contract, the Child, as it may be intereſſed in the benefit of Obedience, may contractively be ſharer in the Guilt and Puniſhment of the Father's diſobedience.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. For that by this his offence he contracted a Loſs of that natural Diſorder and Deformity, which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated to his Poſterity; and the Conſtitution of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>'s poſterity after his fall, was of the very ſame Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper and Corruption, that <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by his Fall. And herein the Caſe of <hi>Adam</hi> differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from all Mankind beſides: The beſt of men born of <hi>Adam</hi> hath the very ſame natural obliquity that the worſt of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Children hath, and if he traduce his Nature to his Child, he traduceth as good as he hath, or ever had: But that Nature, which <hi>Adam</hi> had, and was traducible to his Poſterity before his fall, though the ſame eſſentially which it was after <hi>in ſpecie ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nali,</hi> yet by the Will and Diſpenſation of God had been accompanied with thoſe Qualifications, that had put them in the ſame Degree of Bleſſedneſs and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of conſerving it, that <hi>Adam</hi> had: So then the Sin of <hi>Adam</hi> ingaged his Poſterity in the Guilt: 1. By his perſonating of them; 2. By his traducing Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to them; hence <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5. every imagination of the Heart of Man was only evil continually.</p>
                        <p>And as we by this ſee how <hi>Adams</hi> ſin was the ſin of his Poſterity, ſo upon the ſame ground we ſee the Juſtice of traducing the Puniſhment to his Poſterity. By the Law of Nature and Reaſon, the power of the Father over his Child, eſpecially unborn, is the moſt abſolute and natural power under God in the World; ſo that even by the Univerſal Rule, among men eſpecially, where another Government is not ſub-induced, he had the power over his Life, his Liberty, and his Subſiſtence:
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:50435:100"/>
Man contracts for him and his Poſterity in a part of loſs and benefit; his Poſterity had a ſhare in the latter in caſe of Mans Obedience, and it is reaſon he ſhould bear a part in the former in Caſe of Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: the ſin of a publick Perſon draws a Puniſhment upon thoſe whom he repreſents politically, as <hi>David</hi>'s ſin in numbring the people; much more when to the political Repreſentation is added a natural incluſion: And thus he viſits the iniquity of the Fathers upon the the Children, <hi>viz.</hi> when the Father contracts for him and his Children in a Covenant of benefit and loſs; as he ſhews Mercy unto thouſands in them that love him; the Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> notwithſtanding their own perſonal Sins, had the benefit of that Promiſe, which was made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> becauſe by way of Covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.2.</p>
                        <p>Further the ingagement of the Creator to his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture could not be farther than he himſelf pleaſed; neither could Man, or his Poſterity, challenge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny farther degree or perfection of Being, than God gave, and upon thoſe terms only, upon which he gave it: If he had reſumed it of his own Will from Man, or his Poſterity, after a day or a month, Man had had that for which to be thankful in the enjoyment, not to murmur in the loſs: But it was not ſo here, the ſtock of Bleſſedneſs for Man and his Poſterity is put into the hands of the Father, while he had his Poſterity with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himſelf; and not only ſo, but put into his hands with a power to keep it for him and his Poſterity; the Father proves prodigal, and ſpends his ſtock, and if the Child was ſo, he hath none to blame but the immediate Author of his Being: This is enough moſt clearly to intereſt the Poſterity of <hi>Adam,</hi> at leaſt in the Puniſhment of Loſs of Happineſs and Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, and thoſe outward Curſes, which followed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Adam</hi>'s Nature, and the Creatures, by <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin.</p>
                        <p n="4">
                           <pb n="163" facs="tcp:50435:100"/>4. The time, <hi>In the day thou eateſt.</hi> And this was put in Execution the ſame day, as well as Sentenced: the ſame day Shame, and Guilt, and Fear fell upon him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.10. <hi>I heard thy Voice and was afraid becauſe I was naked:</hi> The ſame day ſhut out from the Viſion of God, and the place of his Happineſs; <hi>Verſe</hi> 24. the ſame day ſet to his work, to Till a curſed Ground, with La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and Sorrow, <hi>Verſe</hi> 23.</p>
                        <p>So now we have ſeen Man what he was, and what he loſt: The next thing conſiderable is, <hi>How it could come to paſs,</hi> that Man, having ſuch a portion of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, both in his Faculties and Fruitions, could be drawn to commit this Sin upon terms of ſo great and viſible diſadvantage to himſelf and his Poſterity: Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatively we ſay it was not any inherent Corruption or Malignancy in the Nature of Man, or any defect of what was neceſſary to his perſeverance in his Original righteouſneſs; for he was very created good: Neither was it any Predetermination that did neceſſitate him to fall; for God, as he gave him a Power to obey his Will, and a Law wherein to exerciſe that power, did leave him in the hands of his own Will: As to ſuppoſe him neceſſitated to obey what God commanded could not ſtand with Mans Liberty, nor with the true Nature of Obedience, which doth neceſſarily ſuppoſe an intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecal power not to obey; ſo to ſuppoſe him conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to diſobey; could neither conſiſt with that Liberty, nor the Purity or Juſtice of God: God did foreſee the fall of Man in the Counſel of his Preſcience, but did not fore-appoint it in the Counſel of his Predetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: The rule of Nature is, That whatſoever is, while it is, is neceſſarily: The offence of Man, though it proceeded from his Liberty, yet when it was, it was neceſſarily: And becauſe all things, before they are, are preſent with God as if they were, and in the ſame degree as if they were, therefore it was in the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:50435:101"/>
ſame degree of Fore-knowledge, as if it had been ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; and conſequently the ſuperſtruction of all that Counſel of God concerning Man after his Fall, was not taken up <hi>pro re nata,</hi> but was as ancient and as firm, as Eternity it ſelf: We find the Fall of Man at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to theſe <hi>Cauſes</hi> ariſing from theſe three, 1. The Devil. 2. Man. 3. God.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>In the Devil:</hi> a lapſed Angel, and in reſpect of the Excellency of his Knowledge and ſpiritual Being, had an advantage, and could out-act the Reaſon of Man, whoſe Soul acts organically; and therefore though Man were created in the higheſt Perfection in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to his Nature, yet he might be over-match'd with the power and ſubtilty of that Evil Angel. He <hi>fitted his Temptation</hi> to that which was moſt deſirable, <hi>viz.</hi> Knowledge: and this Temptation took the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er impreſſion, becauſe in the Command, as hath been obſerved, there was nothing but a pure Experiment of Man's Obedience, and no rational incongruity of the eating of this Fruit more than another: the ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Command, and the ſeverity of the Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty made the ſuggeſted advantage, that might come by this, the more credible: had he gone about to tempt Man to Blaſphemy, to murder his Wife, or any other Sin, (the breach whereof had been equally penal to this) the incongruity of ſuch Acts to that natural Law, which was connatural to him, had made the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion fruitleſs: but that envious Spirit did well know, that the Obligation of every Law was under the ſame Penalty; that this Law, concerning the forbidden Fruit, was moſt obnoxious to his Temptation; that the the deſire of Knowledge was the moſt prevalent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination in Man; and ſo fits his Temptation exactly, <hi>viz.</hi> That this command could have no other End or Reaſon, than to fence Man from ſuch an Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, as might make him yet more like his Maker,

                           <hi>Ye ſhall be as gods, knowing Good and Evil.</hi> And the very ſame way he took with the Second <hi>Adam:</hi> his firſt Temptation was in ſuch a thing, that a Man would wonder where the Fault ſhould be; he was hungry, and in a Wilderneſs, without Bread; Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture could not ſubſiſt, and Bread could not be had there, unleſs it were made; yet our Saviour, being better acquainted with the drift of his Temptation, than was <hi>Eve,</hi> rejected this as a Temptation to a diſtruſt of the Providence of his Father.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. The finitude of his Underſtanding: Though he was created perfect, yet he was created finite: It could not match the Sophiſtry of an Angel. Hence this ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> is called Beguiling and Deceiving: <hi>The Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent beguiled me.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. The Liberty of his Will, which, though he was created Innocent, had nevertheleſs a Power to offend:</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The prevalence of his Senſual Appetite. But this came not in, till the field was almoſt loſt: the Temptation won upon the Underſtanding and Will, before the ſubſidiary aid of the Senſual Appetite did or could come in: the Beauty of the Fruit, and its Goodneſs for Food, was evident to Man before; but it durſt not aſſail the Command of God, till the Underſtanding was deluded with an expectation of Wiſdom.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>In God:</hi> There was nothing poſitive, but only put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of him wholly in his own Power. Doubtleſs he was not ignorant of the deſign of the Serpent, and could have as effectually ſupplanted his endeavour by his ſpecial Aſſiſtance, or by an Angel as effectually have guarded Man from that Tree, as he did that other Tree of Life afterwards from Man; but he had made Man perfect, he hath given him a Command
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:50435:102"/>
under a ſevere Penalty, and hath given him Power to obey it; if he will believe his Creator, and truſt in him, he is ſafe; if he will not, he may chuſe, but is loſt. See the Congruity and difference in the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the firſt and ſecond <hi>Adam:</hi> both tempted by the Devil, that in a Paradiſe, this in a Deſart; that in his Abundance, tempted with Superfluity; this in Want, tempted with Neceſſity; both had abſolute Freedom of Will, and both left to the ſtrength of their own Power, for the Angels came not to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to Chriſt, till the Devil had left him: but the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Adam</hi> in his Temptation will not ſtir a grain from the Command, the <hi>ſcriptum eſt</hi> of God, and the Devil leaves him; the former lets go his ſtrength, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of his Creator, the Lock of his ſtrength, and is taken and overcome.</p>
                        <p>And thus have we ſeen Man in his Glory, and in his Ruine: The former, he did owe to the free Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Goodneſs of God; for how could that, which had not a Being, till it was given him, deſerve ſuch a Being? the latter, he owes only to himſelf; and how can he now expect <hi>a Reparation?</hi> He hath contracted a Guilt, which as his future Doing, or Suffering, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not expiate; for this Suffering is the neceſſary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, not the ſatisfaction of his Guilt; and this Suffering muſt therefore be as everlaſting as his Being, becauſe his Guilt is as everlaſting as his Being: his Doings, were they perfect, were but his Duty, and therefore cannot expiate that Guilt, which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by the breach of that Duty; but could it be available to expiate his Guilt, yet as his Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence made him guilty, ſo it made him unable to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his Duty; his Intellectuals are deprived of that Light, which he hath abuſed, and therefore loſt; his Will corrupted and embaſed, in a ſubjection to his Senſual Appetite; and this Diſobedience, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:50435:102"/>
with many Aggravations, the leaſt whereof might incenſe the very Goodneſs and Patience of his Creator, beyond all hopes of Mercy and Atonement; this Diſobedience againſt God, to whom he owed the moſt exact Obedience; he added Ingratitude to his Diſobedience; he diſobeyed that God, from whom, but even now, he received his Being, and ſuch a Being; he added Perverſeneſs to his Ingratitude, it was againſt ſuch a Command, which he might have kept, and needed not to have broken; he added Wantonneſs to his Perverſeneſs; he diſobeyed, when he had a ſtock of Bleſſedneſs, as ample as his being was capable of; he added Treaſon to his Wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, believing the Voice of a Creature, a Creature that but now had revolted from his God, in a vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainous imputation of God with Falſity and Envy: And how after all this, and infinitely more than this, can he expect any thing from his injured God, but what the ſeverity of his Juſtice can inflict? if he meets with frowardneſs in the Earth, diſtemper in the Air, ſurprizals and inundations in the Water, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion in the Creatures, a ſnare in his Table, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery in his Friend, ſcorn and oppreſſion from his Superiour, ſupplanting from his Equal, envy and miſchief from his Inferiour, falſneſs and temptation from the Wife of his Boſom, rebellion from his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, vanity and diſappointment in his Purpoſes, Diſeaſes, Diſtempers and infections in his Body, madneſs and blindneſs in his Underſtanding, perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in his Will, tumult and confuſion in his Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, guilt and preapprehenſions of terrour in his Conſcience, Death and diſſolution of Body and Soul, and Judgment, Vengeance, Hell, and yet Eternity after all this: Then let Man know, that in all this, and that which is all this, and more than this, the

Averſion of the Favour and Light of the Countenance of God, he eats but the Fruit of his own ways: and thou, O God, art juſt when thou thus judgeſt; and whatſoever is better than the worſt of all this, to any of the Children of men, is meer Mercy, and more than their due.</p>
                        <p>But if now in the midſt of Judgment, God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members Mercy; and Mankind being now condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and concluded under ſin, if the merciful God, that at firſt gave Being and Bleſſing, ſhall, after we had ſpent that Patrimony, and loſt our ſelves, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for <hi>our Reſtitution;</hi> that, when we of Free-Men, had made our ſelves Slaves, and Veſſels of Wrath, ſhall provide a Means for our Deliverance; This engageth us to a higher degree, both of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and Duty, than even our firſt Creation did.

                           <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Of the Reſtitution of Man by Chriſt.</head>
                        <p>ALL Mankind lay, by the Fall, under Guilt, which is an Obligation to Puniſhment, both of loſs of Happineſs, and everlaſting ſubjection both to tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral and eternal Curſe: And this eſtate of Man and his Poſterity, even to the end of the World, was preſent in the infallible Foreſight of God from all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: In that conſideration he had a Kingdom, but over Rebels and Traitors; and had everlaſting cauſe of the execution of his Juſtice and the Power of his Wrath, but nothing to deſerve or draw out his Mercy among all the Sons of Men, who were all preſent, and ſtood up together in his Eternal Foreſight. Thus Man had, as far forth as was in him, diſappointed the End of God in his Creation, inſomuch, that in the outward diſpenſation of God's Providence, it ſeemed that he repented that he had made Man on the Earth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.6. But though Man, as much as in him lay, had made himſelf an uſeleſs Creature, and interrupted the poſſibility of attaining an End anſwerable to his Being, yet God's Counſel was not diſappointed: But the great Lord of his own free Goodneſs, did in his Eternal Counſel fore-appoint ſome of loſt Men to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of their Sin, and eternal Happineſs in Chriſt, by ſuch Means as he had before ordained to be effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual for that purpoſe. And this is the great Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the Scripture, and contains that great Buſineſs which Man hath to do in this World, becauſe it is that which concerns his great and everlaſting End, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:50435:104"/>
which, his very Being is not only unprofitable, but miſerable, and now comes to be conſider'd.</p>
                        <p>This then is <hi>the ſum of all,</hi> That Almighty God, out of his own Free-will and Goodneſs, did in his Eternal Counſel fore appoint ſome of loſt Mankind to Remiſſion of ſin and guilt, and Reconciliation, and Eternal Happineſs in Chriſt, by ſuch Means as he had before ordained in the ſame Counſel to be effectual for that purpoſe. In this deſcription we have theſe <hi>Particulars</hi> to be ſifted, and we have done our Buſineſs.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. What the Motive of this Purpoſe; God's meer good Will:</p>
                        <p n="2">2. What the Object of it; ſome of Mankind:</p>
                        <p n="3">3. What the End of this Counſel; Remiſſion of ſin, and Reſtoration to Happineſs:</p>
                        <p n="4">4. What the Hand or immediate Inſtrument of effecting it; Chriſt:</p>
                        <p n="5">5. What thoſe ſubordinate Means of attaining it:</p>
                        <p n="6">6. What the Conſequents of it.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Touching <hi>the Motive;</hi> nothing at all meritorious in Man, but only the good will of God, thus to ſelect ſome out of the loſt multitude of Men to be Veſſels of Mercy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And this is that which is ſo often incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in the Book of God, in all the ſucceſſions of it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.19. <hi>I will be gracious to whom I will be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and will ſhew mercy to whom I will ſhew mercy.</hi> So <hi>Deut.</hi> 9.5. <hi>Moſes</hi>'s ſad Admonition to the <hi>Jews,</hi> who in all things were typical: <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand therefore, that the Lord thy God giveth thee not this good land for thy righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, for thou art a ſtiff-necked people.</hi> Ezek. 16.6. <hi>When I paſſed by thee, and ſaw thee polluted in thy own blood, I ſaid unto thee, when thou waſt in thy blood, Live? yea, I ſaid unto thee, when thou waſt in thy blood, Live.</hi> Iſaiah 43.25. <hi>I, even I am he that blotteth out thy tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions for mine own ſake, and will not remember thy ſins.</hi> Luke 10.21. <hi>And haſt revealed them to babes: even ſo
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:50435:104"/>
Father, for ſo it ſeemed good in thy ſight.</hi> Epheſ. 2.3. <hi>When we were by nature children of wrath, even as others: But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love, wherewith he hath loved us, even when we were dead in ſins, hath quickned us together with Chriſt: by grace are ye ſaved.</hi> 2 Tim. 1.10. <hi>Who hath ſaved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpoſe and grace; which was given us in Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world began, but now made manifeſt by the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt.</hi> 1 John 4.10. <hi>Here is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us.</hi> Ibid. 19. <hi>We love him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he loved us firſt.</hi> Rom. 5.8. <hi>God commendeth his love towards us in that, while we were yet ſinners, Chriſt died for us.</hi> And indeed, it is impoſſible it ſhould be otherwiſe: for the Scripture hath concluded all under ſin, <hi>Galat.</hi> 3.22. And we have ſhewed before an utter impoſſibility in Man to extricate himſelf. The fore-appointing therefore of any to Eternal Life, could not be from any Cauſe in the Creature, meritoriouſly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God to this Mercy.</p>
                        <p>The Freedom and Liberality of this Purpoſe of God.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. In reſpect of the Elect: to take away all matter of boaſting, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.8. To keep them humble, and to keep them thankful, that God may be all in all. It pleaſeth the great God to order the Execution of his Counſels, touching Man, that they are brought about, as with a powerful and irriſiſtible Hand; ſo they are brought about by ſuch means, as is naturally ſuitable to the nature of Man; Rationally and Freely, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. <hi>Thy people ſhall be willing in the day of thy Power.</hi> Now there cannot be a more engaging Argument to Humility and Thankfulneſs, than the conſideration of this Free Goodneſs of God, that when I had thrown away my Happineſs, lay in the common lump of condemned Men, God ſhould freely ſingle me out among thouſands that he paſſed by, and make me a
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:50435:105"/>
Veſſel of Mercy. And this doth moſt ſweetly and effectually win upon the Heart: So that the very conſideration of this Counſel of God, is a means to effect its Execution, in putting the Heart into ſuch a frame, as is fit to receive the impreſſions of God's Grace.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. In reſpect of thoſe that are omitted: The free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Choice, doth not in the leaſt degree re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon the Juſtice of God: He had no engagement to chuſe any, but might moſt juſtly have let all lie under that ſin and miſery, into which we had caſt our ſelves. If God be pleaſed to chuſe any, it is the meer act of his Grace: if he leaves any, he leaves them but in that condition, not in which he made them, but in which they made themſelves. The act of his Bounty to the Elect, is without any Injury to thoſe he leaves: for neither could challenge any thing but Miſery as their Right.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>The Object</hi> of this Choice:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Some are choſen from all Eternity: <hi>The Elect, according to the foreknowledge of God the Father,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.2. <hi>The foundation of God ſtandeth ſure, having this Seal, The Lord knoweth who are his,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.19. Theſe are thoſe, for whom a Kingdom was prepared from the Foundation of the World, <hi>Matth</hi> 25.34. Theſe are they, which by an eternal Contract between God the Father and his Son, were given unto Chriſt: <hi>I pray for them, which thou haſt given me, for they are thine,</hi> John 17.9, 24.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. But ſome, and not all: Many there are, that are not ſo much as called; and of thoſe that are called, yet few are choſen, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.14. And this preteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God putteth them not in any worſe Condition than it finds them. And indeed, this Counſel of God is not ſo much as the Potter's making ſome Veſſels to honour, ſome to diſhonour: he made all Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:50435:105"/>
of honour, and Men made themſelves all Veſſels of diſhonour: God in his mercy to reſtore ſome to become again Veſſels of honour: and this is without any injury to thoſe that are omitted; becauſe they are continued to be but what they made themſelves, and what they moſt freely deſire ſtill to be: <hi>Thy deſtruction is from thy ſelf, O Jeruſalem.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. To what this Election or Choice is, or what is <hi>the End</hi> of this Counſel of God: There is a twofold End in the Counſel of God.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The End of Intention; ſubordinate, the good of his Creature; adequate, the good pleaſure of his own Will, or his own Glory; as to ſhew his wrath, and make his power known towards the Veſſels of wrath fitted for deſtruction, ſo to make known the riches of his Glory in the Veſſels of Mercy, which he had before prepared unto Glory, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.23.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The End in Execution, or rather the ſubject matter of this Counſel of God: it is the whole Series, and all the Conjunctures of all things conducing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; wherein the Counſel of God doth not <hi>per ſaltum</hi> ſtep from the Fall to Glory, but doth take in all thoſe intermediate paſſages, which he hath by the ſame Counſel, appointed to be the Means of effecting it. 1. The great Myſtery of the Incarnation, which is the <hi>Cardo negotii,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.20. <hi>Who was fore-ordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifeſted in theſe laſt times.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. Effectual calling, by the Word and Spirit of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. <hi>Who are called according to his purpoſe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. The effectual Aſſiſtance of the Spirit of God, without which, it were impoſſible theſe dry Bones ſhould live, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33. <hi>I will put my Law into their mind, and write them in their hearts.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. Holineſs and Sanctification, <hi>John.</hi> 15.16. <hi>I have choſen you, and ordained you, that ye ſhould bring forth fruit,</hi>
                           <pb n="174" facs="tcp:50435:106"/>
Epheſ. 14. <hi>Choſen to be holy,</hi> Epeſ. 2.10. <hi>Created in Chriſt unto good works, which God hath before ordained, that we ſhould walk in them,</hi> Rom. 8.29, 30. Conformity unto Chriſt, and all linked together: Glory to Juſtification; Juſtification to Calling; Calling to Election.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. <hi>In whom,</hi> or by whom, he hath elected us: Chriſt. In this Conſiſts the greateſt Myſtery that ever was, and of moſt concernment to Mankind. And becauſe it is impoſſible to attain to the knowledge of it, but by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation from God himſelf, we muſt in this keep pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely to the Word of God, where alone this Myſtery is by God ordinarily diſcovered: which is briefly thus much.</p>
                        <p>Almighty God in the Creation of Man, did prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily intend the Glory of his own Goodneſs, and the Happineſs of his Creature; and to that End, furniſhed him with ſuch Faculties and Rules, as might conduct him to that Happineſs.</p>
                        <p>Man, being ſeduced, abuſed his Liberty; and by his Diſobedience violated that Rule, and conſequently in himſelf loſt the acquiſition of that Happineſs, to which he was created.</p>
                        <p>Yet this could not diſappoint the Purpoſe of God, who, with an eternal and indiviſible act, did foreſee all Mankind in this miſerable and loſt Condition, and appoint a way for his Recovery.</p>
                        <p>The way of Man's Recovery was by the Eternal Purpoſe, Conſultation, or Contract, as I may call it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Father, Son, and Eternal Spirit, reſolved to be, that the Son of God ſhould aſſume the Nature of Man into one Perſon, by an ineffable Generation, and that he ſhould Satisfie for the Guilt of Man's Sin by his Death.</p>
                        <p>And becauſe that the bare Satisfaction for Sin, could only exempt Man from the deſerved Puniſhment of his Sin, but could not reſtore him to that Happineſs,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:50435:106"/>
which he loſt, by the ſame Eternal Covenant, the Righteouſneſs and Obedience of Chriſt, was to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by God, as the Righteouſneſs of Man; that as in his Sufferings he did bear the Sin of Man, to make Satisfaction for the Curſe deſerved, ſo by his Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence imputed unto Man, Man might acquire that Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs that he loſt.</p>
                        <p>To the end, that this Satisfaction and Righteouſneſs might be effectually applied for the Purpoſes above-mentioned, Chriſt muſt, after this Righteouſneſs ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, and this Satisfaction made by his Death, riſe from Death, aſcend into Heaven, and ſo continue as well the Mediator of Interceſſion, as he was before of Satisfaction. Though this Righteouſneſs, and Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, were ſufficient for the Sins of all Mankind, and accordingly freely propounded, yet it was effectual only for ſuch, as ſhould according to thoſe immediate Means, that God had fore-appointed to be uſeful for that Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, ſue forth the benefit of it.</p>
                        <p>This is the ſum of that great work of Man's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, which the Angels deſire to look into; 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12. and is diſcovered to Principalities and Powers by the Church, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.10. and therefore called, <hi>The manifold Wiſdom of God; The Myſtery of Chriſt,</hi> Epheſ. 3.4.

Bringing forth Fruit, <hi>Ibid.</hi> 16. Doing Righteouſneſs, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.29. Purifying our ſelves, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.3, 7.9.10. Crucifying Affections and Luſts, <hi>Galat.</hi> 5.24. Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of Good Works, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14.3.18. Thus God out of his free Love, appoints us to Eternal Life in Chriſt, freely gives Chriſt to be the purchace of it, freely promiſeth Life for us in him through Faith, freely gives us Faith to come to him, which when it is wrought, our Covenant again with God, is but to return a fruit of his own Grace. True Faith in Chriſt, cannot be without a ſenſe of this Love of God, nor that without a return of Love to him again, nor that without a Care to walk according to his Will, for <hi>if ye love me, ye will keep my Commandments:</hi> And yet he is pleaſed to accept and reward the work of his own free Grace, as the return of us poor and weak Men.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. This Covenant was ordained in the hands of a Mediator, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.19.

Yet in his Service injoyned to the <hi>Jews,</hi> all their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrations, of Covenant, People, Prieſts, Altars, Sanctuary, Veſſels, at once to prefigure the Sacrifice of Chriſt, and the deep dye of the guilt of Sin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.22. <hi>Without ſhedding of Blood is no Remiſſion.</hi> Heb. 13.20. <hi>The Blood of the Everlaſting Covenant.</hi>

                        <p n="5">5. In the <hi>Holy Veſſels:</hi> The <hi>Ark,</hi> a ſpecial ſign of God's Preſence, therefore called the Glory of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4.22. This called the Ark of the Covenant, or the Ark of the Teſtimony, <hi>Joſ.</hi> 2.14. Wherein was placed the Teſtimony, <hi>viz.</hi> The two Tables. <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.16. The Pot of Manna, and <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Rod; theſe being for Teſtimonials to their Poſterity of the Covenant, Power, and Goodneſs of God. As in this Ark the Covenant of God was placed, ſo Chriſt was the Ark of the ſecond Covenant, in whom it was made and conſerved, the receptacle of the fulneſs of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.19. <hi>For it pleaſed the Father that in him ſhould all Fulneſs dwell.</hi> Coloſ. 2.3. <hi>In whom are hid all the Treaſures of Wiſdom and Knowledge.</hi>

                           <pb n="188" facs="tcp:50435:113"/>There were three Rooms in the Tabernacle: 1. The moſt Holy Place, wherein the Ark ſtood, and the Mercy Seat over it, divided by the Veil from the reſt of the Tabernacle, <hi>Exod.</hi> 26.33.

The next were <hi>the Sanctuary,</hi> wherein were the Golden Altar of Incenſe placed before the Veil, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.6. 40.26. The Golden Table, whereupon was ſet the Shew Bread, placed on the North ſide of the Sanctuary, <hi>Ibid.</hi> Verſe 22. And the Golden Candleſtick, placed on the South ſide of the Sanctuary. <hi>Ibid.</hi> Verſe 24. Then there was the Court of the Tabernacle, where the Altar for Burnt-Offerings was placed. And by the door of the Tabernacle, is intended without the door of the Tabernacle, which the rather appears, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Laver of Braſs was put between the Altar and the door of the Congregation. And all theſe are likewiſe ſhadows of Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>And becauſe we find <hi>the Veil</hi> to be expreſly called the humane nature of Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.20.

                        <p n="1">1. The <hi>Altar of Incenſe</hi> made of pure Gold, upon which was to be offered a perpetual <hi>Incenſe</hi> before the Lord throughout their Generations, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.8. And this was placed before the Veil by the Ark and the Mercy Seat, and a peculiar Incenſe to be uſed in it, that no Man might make the like, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.38. This doth clearly typifie the continual Interceſſion of Chriſt, who ceaſeth not to make Interceſſion for us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. And no other Mediation but his muſt be uſed, he is the only Name. This imports that Prieſtly Office of Chriſt.</p>

And Shew-bread ſet upon the Table before God always, importing as well that Regal Office of Chriſt in his Church, as that Fulneſs of all ſpiritual Bleſſings which is in him: and therefore he doth not unuſually ſtile himſelf the Bread of Life, and the Bread that came down from Heaven, <hi>John</hi> 6.48.

This Altar placed without the Tabernacle in the Court of the Tabernacle, where all the People came, typifying that univerſal Exhibition of this Sacrifice to all, and that the initiation of every Man into the favour and preſence of God, was to be through this Altar. God exhibited himſelf to the Prieſt and <hi>Moſes</hi> over the Mercy Seat, which was at the door of the moſt Holy; But to all the People the place of the manifeſtation of his preſence, was at the door of the Tabernacle over this Altar, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.42, 43. <hi>And there will I meet with the children of Iſrael:</hi> And the ſuffering of Chriſt without the Gate, was not without ſome Alluſion to the placing of this Altar without the Tabernacle, <hi>Vide</hi> Heb. 13.12. And as the ſituation of the Altar, ſo the Sacrifice upon this Altar, not without a Myſtery; for beſides thoſe many Sacrifices, which were diverſified according to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral natures of the Occaſion, here was one Sacrifice appropriate to this Altar, the continual Burnt-Offering, a Lamb of the firſt year in the Morning, a Lamb of the firſt year at Even, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.38. <hi>Numb.</hi> 28.3.

his continual preſenting of their Names, their Perſons, in his Righteouſneſs before his Father.</p>

A moſt ſpecial <hi>Reconſecration</hi> almoſt of all the things incident to that Service before it was perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: the Prieſt was to make an Atonement for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by the Blood of the Bullock Verſe 11. and for the Altar, Verſe 18. which ſignifie that Purification of the Humane Nature of Chriſt from all Sin Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and Actual; from all Sin even in his Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that ſo he might be a fit High Prieſt <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.26. <hi>For ſuch a high prieſt became us, who is Holy, Harmleſs, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndefiled, Separate from Sinners, and made higher than the Heavens.</hi> The difference was this, <hi>Aaron,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his firſt Conſecration to his Office, needed a new Atonement when he entred into the Holy of Holies, and exerciſed that high Type of Chriſt's Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Interceſſion: But Chriſt, being once Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate, needed no new Conſecration, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.28. <hi>For the Law maketh men High Prieſts which have infirmities, but the Word of the Oath, which was ſince the Law, maketh the Son, who is Conſecrated for evermore.</hi>
                        </p>

that were but once in the Year, were Types of thoſe things that were to be done but once, though remembred yearly; ſuch was the killing of the Paſſover: <hi>Chriſt by one Offering hath perfected them that are ſanctified,</hi> Heb. 10.14.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. This great Atonement not made but <hi>by Blood, Heb.</hi> 9.7. The high Prieſt entred not without Blood, <hi>Livit.</hi> 26. And this Atonement was to be made upon the Horns of the Altar, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16.18. <hi>viz.</hi> The Golden Altar of Incenſe <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.10. Hence Chriſt called the Blood of ſprinkling, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12.24. The Offering, that was to be uſed in this ſolemn Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for ſo much as concerned the Sins of the People were two Goats, which were to be preſented before the Lord, at the door of the Tabernacle, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16.7. And Lots to be caſt, one for the Lord, the other for the Scape-Goat: the former was to be the Sin-offering for the People, and his Blood to be brought within the Veil; Verſe 23. And the other was to bear the Iniquity of the Children of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> but to be ſent into the Wilderneſs. <hi>Ibid.</hi> Verſ. 21. Although in the Sacrifice of Chriſt his Body only died, and his Soul eſcaped, yet both were but one Sacrifice; he did bear our ſins in both; his Soul was heavy unto death, as well as his Body crucified; and as God had prepared him a Body in order to this Sacrifice, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.5. So he made his Soul an Offering for Sin, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. As after all this, the Prieſt entred into the moſt Holy, and preſented this Blood of Reconciliation before the Mercy Seat, and no Man was to be in the Tabernacle when he goeth in, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16.17. So Chriſt, having trodden alone the Wine preſs of his Father's Wrath, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 63.3. Is entred into the Holy Place, not made with Hands, now to appear in the

The <hi>Efficacy</hi> of this Satisfaction conſiſts in that free Acceptance by God of this Sacrifice of Chriſt, as a Satisfaction for the Sins of his Elect, and to be the price of the Inheritance thereby purchaſed for them, by an eternal Contract between the Father and the Son: for otherwiſe it were impoſſible of its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that the Sacrifice of one could expiate for the ſin of another. The tenor of this great Covenant between God and Chriſt was that the Son ſhould take upon him Fleſh, ſhould fullfil the Law of our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhould ſuffer death, and riſe again, and that Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God would accept this as the ſatisfaction for the ſins of the righteous, and as the price of Eternal Life for

as many as ſhould believe in him: This is effectually ſet forth by the Word of Truth it ſelf, <hi>John</hi> 6.37, 38, 39, 40. <hi>All that the Father giveth me ſhall come unto me, and him that cometh to me, I will in no wiſe caſt out; for I came down from heaven not to do my own Will, but the will of him that ſent me; and this is the Father's will that hath ſent me, that of all which he hath given me, I ſhould loſe nothing, but ſhould raiſe it up again at the laſt day: And this is the will of him that ſent me, that every one which ſeeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life, and I will raiſe him up at the laſt day:</hi> It is the Will of God, which is nothing but the Accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton of God: 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.10. <hi>He ſent his Son to be the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation for our ſins:</hi> his ſending was his Acceptation. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10. <hi>When thou ſhalt make his ſoul an offering for ſin:</hi> there was the Acceptation of the Father: Again on the Son's part: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.6, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>As the original Reſolution of all the Works and
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:50435:117"/>
Counſels of God muſt be into his own good pleaſure, ſo eſpecially of this: <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.5. <hi>He hath predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted us to the adoption of children by Jeſus Chriſt to himſelf, according to the good pleaſure of his Will.</hi> Yet we do find ſome <hi>Congruity of Right Reaſon</hi> in this courſe of Man's Redemption.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. To magnifie to all the World the Glory of his <hi>free Grace; Epheſ.</hi> 1.6. and to take away all poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of boaſting in the ſubject of this Redemption: <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.8. <hi>By Grace are ye ſaved through Faith, and that not of your ſelves; it is the gift of God, not of works, leſt any man ſhould boaſt.</hi> 1 Cor. 1.29. <hi>That no fleſh ſhould glory in his preſence.</hi> The Dependence that all Creatures, eſpecially Man, have upon the Creator, both in their Being and Perfection, doth moſt juſtly and reaſonably challenge from the reaſonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, a free Retribution of Acknowledgment of his Dependence upon the Goodneſs of God; and it is an affection of the greateſt Congruity that is imaginable: yet we ſee how ſoon Man forgot that duty, and would be independent upon his Lord. Now when Man had concluded all his Poſterity under ſin, then for God freely to give ſuch a Price of Redemption, as it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifies the Freeneſs and Bounty of his Goodneſs, ſo it doth ingage lapſed Man to the everlaſting Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of the Free Grace of God in reſtoring him, that ſo God may be all in all.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. To magnifie the Exquiſiteneſs of his <hi>Juſtice:</hi> In that dreadful Proclamation of the Name of God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6, 7. we find a ſtrange mixture of his Mercy and Juſtice: <hi>Forgiving Iniquity, Tranſgreſſion and Sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty:</hi> and both parts eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to his Name. Such a way then muſt be for Man's Reſtoration that may evidence his Mercy in pardoning, as well as his Juſtice in puniſhing Sin: Chriſt was made <hi>ſin for us, who knew no ſin, that we
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:50435:118"/>
might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. And being made Sin for us, was likewiſe made a Curſe for us, <hi>Galat.</hi> 3.13. Here we have him par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning Iniquity, Tranſgreſſion and ſin of Men, and yet not ſparing his own Son when he bore the imputed guilt of our ſins.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. To magnifie the glory of his <hi>Wiſdom.</hi> The ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Fabrick of the World ſpeaks abundantly the Wiſdom of our Creator; but all this was inferiour and ſubſervient unto this great Buſineſs: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24. <hi>Chriſt the Power of God and the Wiſdom of God:</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.22. A Buſineſs for the inquiry and ſpeculation of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.10. The manifold Wiſdom of God: the end of the Creation, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.16.

That he might gather together in one all things in Chriſt. The ſum of this Myſtery we have, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. <hi>God manifeſted in the fleſh juſtified in the Spirit, ſeen of Angels, preached to the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received into glory.</hi> In this great frame of Man's Redemption, we ſee the Counſel of God ſtrangely executed, his ancient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes fulfilled, the Shadows and Types of the Law unveiled, the breach of the righteous Law of God pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, the Righteouſneſs thereof fulfilled, the Juſtice of God ſatisfied, his Mercy glorified, his Creature par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, juſtified, glorified; all thoſe difficulties, intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacies, and confuſions, which came into the world by the ſin of Man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> extricated, ordered, and ſalved; the even ſeeming Diſappointments and Fruſtrations of the Love of God to Man, and the glory of God in him, improved to the higher manifeſtation both of his Love and Glory. This is the Lord's doing, and let it ever be marvellous in our Eyes.</p>
                        <p n="4">
                           <pb n="199" facs="tcp:50435:118"/>4. The Congruity of it, even to that nature that is in Man. The great God could have over-ruled his Creature to his own Will by his own Power; but he rather chuſeth to bring him up unto him by ſuch means as are congruous to the nature of his Creature, and let in a ſupernatural Light and Life by natural means and inſtruments. The Son of God takes upon him Fleſh, and in his Fleſh reveals the way and means of Life: 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.1. <hi>That which was from the beginning, which we have heard; which we have ſeen with our eyes, which we have looked upon,</hi> &amp;c. In this Fleſh he evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denceth his Love to Mankind, ſuffers, dies for them. As the Diſcovery of the Truth by him was moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to our manner of Underſtanding, ſo was that Love which he ſhewed to us moſt winning upon our Wills: <hi>In this is the love of God made manifeſt, that when we were enemies Chriſt died for us: Greater love than this, ſheweth no Man.</hi> Thus he winneth us with the cords of Love, and maketh us willing in the day of his Power, eſpecially when this Light and Love is carried home to the Heart with the ſtrength of his own powerful Spirit.</p>
                        <p>Man is a compounded Creature of Senſes, Paſſions, and Spirit; and though his Excellence conſiſt in the latter, and to the higher Perfection he attains, the more ſpiritual he is; yet as he owes even the ſervice of his more inferiour Faculties to his Lord, ſo they were not uſeleſly placed in him, even in reference to his ſupreme End: there is the Exceſs, uſually Man is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate in the former, eſpecially his Senſes, and that is much evidenced by the proneneſs of Man to Idolatry and ſenſual Worſhip, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.1. <hi>Make us gods that may go before us:</hi> this Malady the Wiſe God, that knows our frame, doth not only cure with ſevere Comminations and Prohibitions, but diverts it: he gave the <hi>Jews</hi> outward Sacrifices and Obſervations; he hath given
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:50435:119"/>
us Chriſtians his Image in his Son, to divert us from Idolatry; his Love and Compaſſion revealed even in our own fleſh, to take up our Affections; and yet by theſe leads us up to a higher pitch, <hi>John</hi> 6.63. Even by ſenſual Objects and Expreſſions he leads up to ſpiritual: <hi>It is the Spirit that quickens, the fleſh profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nothing: the words that I ſpeak unto you, they are Spirit, and they are Life.</hi> And this is moſt evident in the whole Life of Chriſt; for though he ſtill winds up his Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to the high and ſpiritual conceptions, yet he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to uſe thoſe motives that work upon the Senſes and Paſſions: Miracles, Tears, Parables, Importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Signs, diverſity of Tongues, Viſions of Angels, ſenſual Convictions to <hi>Thomas, John</hi> 20.27. <hi>Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands:</hi> and to all his Diſciples, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.39. <hi>Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I my ſelf.</hi> Thus, although the Power of God could have wrought his Work in his by an immediate hand, he rather chuſeth ſuch Means as may bear Congruity with the humane and reaſonable Nature of his reaſonable Creatures.</p>

                        <p>NOW we come to conſider the great Work it ſelf of our Redemption by Chriſt:
<list>
                              <item>1. What it is?</item>
                              <item>2. How effected?</item>
                              <item>3. For whom?</item>

                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. For the firſt: Man, by his Sin incurred a Guilt which bound him over, 1. To a neceſſity of loſing the Favour and Preſence of God, which was to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and kept only by Obedience; 2. To a neceſſity of undergoing the wrath of God as the juſt reward of his Diſobedience. That Redemption that we now conſider, muſt ſupply both theſe.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. There muſt be a deliverance from that Wrath, which was juſtly ſentenced upon Man for his Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: And becauſe it is impoſſible that the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment could be removed, unleſs the Guilt were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe removed, ſome courſe muſt be taken to remove that Guilt: And becauſe the Guilt of any one Offence doth everlaſtingly diſable that perſon, that hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted it, to avoid or expiate it; and puts it wholly and everlaſtingly in the power of that Perſon that is offended, to be judge of his own Satisfaction; for if it were imaginable, that an offender could for the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:50435:120"/>
future as far out act his Duty, as in his Offence he came ſhort of it, it is not conceptible to be ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry without the acceptation of him that is offended: hence it is, that unleſs our offended Creator, to whom we owe our Obedience to the utmoſt extent of our Beings, accept a Satisfaction for our Guilt, it is not poſſible, nor imaginable, that the Guilt of any one Sin can receive any Expiation. It is true, he might have releaſed it of his abſolute Power without any Satisfaction, but that he would not do, as is before ſhewen; then that he accepted any Satisfaction it is a wonder of Mercy; but that he ſhould propound it himſelf, and ſuch a Satisfaction as Chriſt, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it, it is a Wonder of Wonders. And for this reaſon the foundation of our Redemption is ever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the Love of God: 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.1. <hi>Behold what manner of love the Father hath beſtowed upon us.</hi> 1 John 4.9. <hi>In this was manifeſted the love of God towards us, becauſe God ſent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.</hi> 2 Cor. 5.19. <hi>God was in Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling the world unto himſelf, not imputing their treſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to them:</hi> The very foundation of Man's Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption from his Guilt and Puniſhment by Chriſt, was the Love of God in ſending, and accepting his Son's Satisfaction.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. But if we had only a Remiſſion of our Guilt, though that might have removed our Puniſhment, it had not cured our Loſs: therefore to ſet Man right, there muſt not only be the removal of the Wrath of God, which made us miſerable, but his Favour and Reconciliation, without which we could not be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. And becauſe, though our Debt were paid, yet we could never come to the Favour and Acceptance of God, unleſs his Image, the Rule which he planted in Man to attain Happineſs, were again reſtored to Man: and becauſe that is impoſſible for us to do, we
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:50435:120"/>
by our Sin contracted Blindneſs as well as Guilt, and Weakneſs as well as Blindneſs: and therefore as we muſt up to our Creator for Acceptation of Satisfaction for our Guilt, ſo we muſt to him to provide our Righteouſneſs. Though we had found Chriſt Sin for us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. and Chriſt a Curſe for us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. before we could be delivered from our Curſe; ſo had we found that we had been ſtill ſhort of our Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, unleſs we had alſo found him as well our Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs as our Redemption, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. As well our Victory, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.57. as our Deliverer from the Wrath to come, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.10. As well our Life, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.4. as our Deliverance from Death; as well our Purifier as our Redemption from Iniquity, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14. as well our Peace, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.14. as our Price; as well the Price of our purchaſed Inheritance, as the Price of our Ranſom, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20. As well our Tranſlator into his own Kingdom as the Deliverer from the power of Darkneſs, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.13. And this, as the former, we owe likewiſe in the original and foundation of it to the free Love and Acceptation of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. Chriſt of God is made Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and therefore called the Righteouſneſs of God by Faith, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.19. Without this free Love of God, as it is impoſſible to imagine a Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and Man, ſo much more is it impoſſible to imagine how the Righteouſneſs of that Mediator ſhould be the Righteouſneſs of a guilty ſinful Man: Our Redemption and Salvation by Chriſt hath its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal and ſtrength from the free Love and Acceptation of God.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>How</hi> this Redemption and Salvation was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately <hi>effected:</hi> which was thus: The Eternal Word took upon him the Nature of Man in the unity of one Perſon, and in our Nature did fulfil that Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which we were bound to fulfil, and did under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:50435:121"/>
take our Guilt, and underwent the Puniſhment due to that Guilt, which was accepted of God as the Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for the ſins of the Elect, for the Remiſſion of their ſins; and his Righteouſneſs accepted as the Righteouſneſs of thoſe, for whom he ſo ſatisfied; whereby he did not only aboliſh Death (the Curſe due to our ſins) but brought Life and Immortality to light, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10.

<pb n="205" facs="tcp:50435:121"/>
of Chriſt was never disjoyned from the Father, ſo it went not to him; conſequently <hi>my Father is greater than I,</hi> muſt be ſpoken in reference to him under that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which was, To go to the Father.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That Chriſt was <hi>perfect Man,</hi> conſiſting of a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Soul: <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.38. <hi>My Soul is exceeding ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful, even unto death:</hi> and of a humane Body, even after his Reſurrection: <hi>Luke</hi> 24.39. <hi>A ſpirit hath not fleſh and bones, as ye ſee me have:</hi> and this Humane Nature ſubject to natural Paſſions: he was ſorrowful, hungry, ſenſible of pain; and <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.15. tempted in all things as we are, yet without ſin: he was ſubject to the Infirmities of our Nature, not to the Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of our Nature. This Humane Nature he took of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and ſo was truly the Seed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham:</hi> But this by a miraculous Procreation by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Power of God, <hi>Matth.</hi> 1.20. and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the contagion or guilt of any ſin: As he did no ſin, nor guile was found in his mouth, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.22. ſo he knew no ſin, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. And if he had had any Guilt of his own, then he could not have been a fit Sacrifice or Prieſt for us, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. A Lamb without ſpot or blemiſh: <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.26. <hi>For ſuch a high-prieſt became us, who is holy, harmleſs, undefiled,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. That <hi>both theſe Natures</hi> were <hi>united</hi> in the Perſon of Chriſt our Mediator, yet without any confuſion of Natures, and the conjunction ſo ſtrict, that in both Natures he was but one Mediator. And hence it is, that many of thoſe things that were properly to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to one Nature, and not to the other, are affirmed of the Perſon of Chriſt, under the Notion proper to the other Nature of Chriſt: (<hi>Acts</hi> 20.28.) <hi>Ye are redeemed with the blood of God:</hi> there the act of the Humane Nature is attributed to the Perſon of Chriſt in the Notion of the Divine Nature: Again, <hi>John</hi> 3.13. <hi>No man hath aſcended into Heaven, but he that
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:50435:122"/>
came down from Heaven, even the Son of man, which is in Heaven,</hi> yet that Nature of the Son of man was not then in Heaven: But ſo ſtrict is this perſonal Union, that whatſoever is affirmed concerning one Nature, may be affirmed of the whole Perſon of the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; but yet ſo diſtinct are the Natures that nothing that is affirmed concerning one Nature can be affirmed of the other Nature: the eternal Son of God dyed for us, but the Deity of the Son of God dyed not: Herein we therefore conclude,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That both Natures were united into one Perſon.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That both Natures thus united made up but one Mediatour, and ſo both Natures united into one Office, as well as into one Perſon.</p>

That notwithſtanding the uniting of both Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures into one Perſon and Office, yet are there acts or things that properly belong to one Nature, which do not belong to the other: thus the Father is ſaid to be greater than the Son, <hi>John</hi> 14.28. in reference to his humane Nature: <hi>Mark</hi> 13.32. <hi>But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no not the Angels which are in Heaven, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Son, but the Father:</hi> For although the Natures were united in one Perſon, yet it is not imaginable that the fullneſs of the Divine Nature was communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the humane; for that were to make the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature of Chriſt infinite, and not ſo much aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med unto as converted into the Divine Nature; and then it had been impoſſible he could have ſuffered, or have had any Eclipſe of the light of his Fathers Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, as he did in his bitter cry upon the Croſs; at which time without all queſtion there was not nor could be any intermiſſion of Communion between the Divine Nature of Chriſt and his Father: So in his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering his humane Nature only ſuffered.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Although the ſufferings and actions of his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature were not to be attributed to his Divine
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:50435:122"/>
Nature, yet they are to be attributed to the whole Perſon of Chriſt; for the Union of both Natures in one Perſon, added that invaluable value even to the ſufferings and actions properly attributable to his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature: the man Chriſt was the offering, but the God Chriſt was the Altar, that ſanctified that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering; for had not the Divine Nature added that value to his Righteouſneſs and Death, it had been impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that it could be meritorious; the Death of a moſt innocent Perſon may bring a Guilt upon them that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict it, not a merit for another unleſs, cloathed with a higher worth than Innocence.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. That there was a Neceſſity that Chriſt ſhould have both Natures, and both Natures thus united in one Perſon: This includes three Neceſſities.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The neceſſity of an Humane Nature. It is true, that God could of his abſolute power have reſtored man without the intervention of any thing but his own Will: but as in all his works he holds ſuch a courſe, as his Wiſdom, Goodneſs, and Juſtice are conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and legible, ſo eſpecially in this excellent work of our Redemption there is an admirable order and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity in all the paſſages of it.</p>
                        <p>The Children of <hi>Adam</hi> had a threefold Union in him: a Specifical Union, as being of the ſame ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical Nature with him; a Virtual Union, being all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in him; and a Repreſentative Union in that great Covenant of Nature, which <hi>Adam</hi> made with his Creator: and ſo all partaked of the conſequences of his Diſobedience: Death went over all, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.4, 22. <hi>As in Adam all die, ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive:</hi> There was therefore an Union of Natures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Redeemer and Redeemed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.16, 17. <hi>For verily he took not on him the Nature of Angels, but the Seed of Abraham: wherefore it beh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>ved him to be in all things like unto his Brethren,</hi> &amp;c. There is likewiſe a
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:50435:123"/>
Virtual and Repreſentative Union between the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer and Redeemed: and this could not have been without that Natural Union which was between them, though not merely by it, as ſhall appear hereafter; hence Chriſt and his Church one Body, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.5. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12, 27. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.23. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.19. they grow up into him in all things, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.13. By Virtue of this Union it is that when Chriſt being made ſin for us was crucified, our Old man was crucified with him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.6. the ſame Spirit that quickened Chriſt quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eneth us to the firſt Reſurrection, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.11. and to the ſecond Reſurrection, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.20. they are Sons and Heirs of God by Virtue of this Union, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.7. their Afflictions fill up the meaſure of Chriſt's Afflictions, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.24. and he reckons their ſufferings his, and Compaſſions to them eſteemed as done to to him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.44. their Union to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is through their Union to him, which is one with the Father, <hi>John</hi> 17.22, 23. <hi>That they may be one, as we are one: I in them and they in me.</hi> Now though it is certain, that this Union groweth by another means than the bare conjunction of our Nature, yet here is the congruity: Chriſt is united unto us by our Nature, we to him by his Spirit: ſo that the Unity of Nature with us holds a congruity with that Union which was between the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> and us.</p>
                        <p>Again ſuch was the Will of God, that the Expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Sins ſhould not be without a Sacrifice, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.22. <hi>Without ſhedding of Blood no remiſſion:</hi> It was neceſſary therefore that he ſhould have a Body prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him, which, might be a Sacrifice for ſin.</p>
                        <p>Again we ſee in all the works of God, though he was at his Pleaſure to interpoſe his own immediate Power, yet he uſeth means con natural to the Subject upon which he works: And hence it is, that our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer works upon all that is Rational in man: In
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:50435:123"/>
his Teaching he taught convincingly, with ſound Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; in his Perſwaſions with Tears, with Miracles, with Promiſes, with Threatnings, with a free laying down of his Life for us, when we were Enemies: Theſe could not be communicated in a way proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to our Nature, but from him that bore our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The neceſſity of the Divine Nature: Queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the humane Nature of Chriſt had as exact a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity and innocence, as in the Creation was placed in <hi>Adam;</hi> but that could not be capable alone of a Merit beyond it ſelf: there was a neceſſity of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Dignity in Chriſt, more than could be found in the created Nature of man, to make his Righteouſneſs and Sufferings meritorious for others; for it muſt be a Righteouſneſs more than commenſurate to all the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs of Men, and a Satisfaction more than commenſurate to all the Demerit of men: This had been impoſſible, if that Righteouſneſs and that Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction had received their value from any thing below the Divine Nature; hence is that Expreſſion, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. <hi>Take heed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to feed the Church if God, which he hath purchaſed with his own Blood.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And as it was neceſſary in reſpect of his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and Satisfaction, ſo in reſpect of the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Exigences of his people, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.18. <hi>through him we have acceſs by one Spirit unto the Father:</hi> He could not be a perfect Mediator unleſs he had a clear Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with all the Exigences of his people, unleſs he could be preſent with them in all their Fears, deſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, Temptations, and Neceſſities; which requires, the co-exiſtence of the Divine Nature.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. We ſay that the Eternal word did in the appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted time take fleſh of the Virgin into the Unity of one Perſon. This was that infinite Motion of the Love of God, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt to become Man for us, and then to
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:50435:124"/>
become Sin for us. The manner of the Incarnation of Chriſt we cannot diſcover: every work of God is paſt our diſcovery, much more this admirable work. And by this Birth of Chriſt he took upon him the Nature of man, but not any Original or inherent Sin or Guilt, becauſe by a miraculous Generation: the very ſubſtance was purified, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.35. <hi>that holy thing which ſhall be born of thee,</hi> &amp;c. and this very Birth of Chriſt was part of his Satisfaction, becauſe part of his Humiliation, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.5. <hi>He made himſelf of no Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and took upon him the form of a Servant, and was made in the likeneſs of Men,</hi> Heb. 2.9. <hi>was made lower than the Angels:</hi> So that in his Conception and Birth we find, 1. His Satisfaction; 2. His Righteouſneſs.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. We ſay, <hi>The whole Life of Chriſt,</hi> till his Paſſion, had theſe three parts in it, <hi>viz.</hi> Satisfaction by way of Suffering; 2. Satisfaction by way of Righteouſneſs; and 3. Inſtruction: and theſe three were the great <hi>Ends</hi> of his Life.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>or his Suffering part: Chriſt, being born with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Sin, and perfectly framed to the image of God, could not in Juſtice be liable to any of thoſe conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences that fell upon <hi>Adam</hi> or his poſterity by Sin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe every Affliction of what kind ſoever, is but a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn upon the Creature of the Fruit of his obliquity: therefore ſince we have concluded him without Sin, he could not be of himſelf meritoriouſly obnoxious to any thing that had the Nature of Puniſhment in it; therefore we muſt conclude, that thoſe inconveniences of his Life were Satisfactory. It is time thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of humane Nature, which are not only conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents of Sin, but have in them the Nature of Sin, as diſorder of Paſſions, fell not upon Chriſt, but ſuch as were merely conſequents of Sin: Chriſt did ſuffer in his Life; he became of no Repu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p n="2">2. The ſecond great End of Chriſt's incarnation was that he might fulfil the Law and Will of God as well in the Command, as in the Type, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.19. <hi>I came not to deſtroy the Law, but to fulfil it:</hi> For as it was requiſite that he ſhould be free from Sin, ſo it was neceſſary he ſhould fulfil all Righteouſneſs: and as the Imputation of our ſins unto him, is that which clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth us from the Guilt of our ſin, ſo the imputation of this Righteouſneſs unto us is that which makes our Perſons accepted in the ſight of God: hence he is called, <hi>The Lord of Righteouſneſs, Jer.</hi> 23.6. And Chriſt of God is made unto us Righteouſneſs, as well as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. Grace reigned through Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs by Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.21. and the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:50435:125"/>
of this Righteouſneſs is that which perfects our Peace with God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. <hi>By the Righteouſneſs of one the free Gift came upon all to Juſtification, Rom.</hi> 5.18. And thus, though it were the Righteouſneſs of the humane Nature, yet it is called the Righteouſneſs of God by Faith, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9. And this Righteouſneſs of Chriſt was that exact Conformity to the Will of God, in which God was well pleaſed with us, as well as him. Now it was impoſſible for any to fulfil that Righteouſneſs, which was the Righteouſneſs of a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>onal and humane Nature; but he that had a rational and humane Nature: as the Righteouſneſs of any thing below the humane Nature, bears not a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Righteouſneſs of a humane Nature, ſuch are the Regularities of the ſenſitive and vegetative Nature; ſo the Righteouſneſs of any Nature above the humane Nature could not be ſuitable for us: Thus the Righteouſneſs of an Angelical Nature, is not proportionable to the exigence of our Natures; the Law which was given to our Natures cannot ſquare with theirs, for that Law was fitted to our whole <hi>Compoſitum;</hi> therefore it was neceſſary for Chriſt to fulfil ſuch a Righteouſneſs as might hold propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to thoſe for whom it was intended, and this could be no other than that Righteouſneſs which muſt be performed in the Life of an humane Nature.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The third great work of Chriſt's Life was for an Inſtruction and that double:</p>

Now this Exemplary Life could not be given us, but in our own Nature, and yet without it we had been without a moſt rational means of pleaſing God, and ſo arriving at our Happineſs: the Pattern of the Tabernacle, that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaw in the Mount, was of as great uſe to him in framing it as the particular <hi>Dictamina</hi> concerning it.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Of Doctrin: The Will of God concerning man was in effect obliterated; Partly, by the corruption and decay of our Nature by ſin; Partly, by the juſt Judgment of God in withdrawing himſelf and that light which Man had abuſed: And as in the Principles of Truth, man became defective, ſo in the Principles of Practice, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.21, 26. <hi>God gave them up to vile affections,</hi> inſomuch that among the very <hi>Jews</hi> who had the very Counſels of God among them, the very Principles of their known Laws were adulterated and corrupted. Now for this purpoſe was Chriſt born, as he teſtifies of himſelf, <hi>John</hi> 18.37. <hi>To this end was I born, and for this end came I into the World, that I ſhould bear Witneſs unto the Truth;</hi> and as he was the Light of the World, as he affirms of himſelf, 1 <hi>John</hi> 8.12. ſo he was furniſht with a Doctrin from God, <hi>John</hi> 7.16. <hi>My Doctrin is not mine, but his that ſent me,</hi> John 7.16. and with a Power of delivery beyond the Power of a mere Man, <hi>John</hi> 7.46. <hi>Never man ſpake like this man,</hi>

                        <p n="7">7. That Chriſt, bearing the ſins of his People, did ſuffer the wrath of God for the Remiſſion of their ſins. <hi>The ſufferings of Chriſt</hi> did only befal his Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for his Divine Nature was impaſſible; yet in reſpect of that ſtrict union of both Natures in one Perſon; they received a value from that divine and impaſſible Nature: for the union of both Natures in
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:50435:127"/>
one Perſon, though it did not communicate the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of either Nature to the other, did communicate the conditions of either Nature to the ſame Perſon, as is before ſhewn.</p>
                        <p>This Suffering of Chriſt had theſe ſeveral Attributions,</p>
                        <p n="1">1 It was a <hi>Voluntary</hi> Suffering, and yet not without a Neceſſity: The Suffering was Voluntary, even in reſpect of his Humane Nature, yet Obediential to the Counſel and Purpoſe of God, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.21. he muſt go and ſuffer. <hi>Luke</hi> 24 26. <hi>Ought not Chriſt to have ſuffered theſe things?</hi> Acts 2.23. <hi>Him being deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by the determinate counſel and fore-knowledge of God:</hi> Yet was this moſt Voluntary in Chriſt: Voluntary in the original undertaking of this Work, in that Eternal Suſception by the Eternal Word; Voluntary in the diſcharge of that Undertaking in the Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the Humane Nature of Chriſt purſuing and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the will of Eternity: <hi>Luke</hi> 12.50. <hi>I have a baptiſm to be baptized withal, and how am I ſtraitned till it be accompliſhed?</hi> And even when the Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture did according to the Law of Nature, ſhrink from its own diſſolution, yet he preſently corrects that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Paſſion: <hi>John</hi> 12.27. <hi>Father, ſave me from this hour: But for this cauſe came I to this hour. Father, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie thy Name.</hi> Matth. 26.39. <hi>O my Father, if it be p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>ſſible, let this cup paſs from me: nevertheleſs, not as I will, but as thou wilt:</hi> whiles his Humanity trembles and ſtartles at the Buſineſs he goes about; yet his Love to his Church, his Obedience to his Father, his Faithfulneſs to his Undertaking, breaks through that natural re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctance. Now the Voluntarineſs, yet obedience of Chriſt's ſuffering, both conſiſtent, appears, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.15. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. <hi>I lay down my life for my ſheep. No man ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it from me, but I lay it down of my ſelf:</hi> yet <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.6, 10. <hi>All we like ſheep have gone aſtray, and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all: it pleaſed the Lord to
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:50435:127"/>
bruiſe him: when thou ſhalt make his ſoul an offering for ſin.</hi> Pſal. 2.7, 8. As he made himſelf of no reputation, and humbled himſelf, ſo he became obedient to death. <hi>Titus</hi> 2.14. <hi>He gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity:</hi> yet <hi>John</hi> 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son,</hi> &amp;c. Again, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.9. <hi>Herein perceive we the love of God, becauſe he laid down his life for us:</hi> Yet <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. <hi>He ſpared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all.</hi> 1 John 4.9. <hi>God ſent his Son to be the propitiation for our ſins.</hi> Pſal. 40.7. <hi>Then ſaid I, lo, I come:</hi> yet he came not without a Miſſion: <hi>I delight to do thy will, O my God.</hi> The ſum of all then is, the Love of God to Mankind was the abſolute and original foundation of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption: the ſame act of this Love propoſed and undertook the Redemption of Mankind voluntarily and freely in this way contrived by the Eternal Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Counſel of God: The Humane Nature of Chriſt in exact and voluntary ſubmiſſion unto this Counſel performed it: If it had been Voluntary and not in Conformity to the Will of God, whoſe Will could be the only meaſure of his Satisfaction, it could never have been ſatisfactory: And if it had been meerly Paſſive, it could not have been an Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which requires a free Submiſſion and Conformity to the Will of him that injoyns, without which it could never be meritorious.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. It was a <hi>Meritorious and Expiatory</hi> Suffering; for by that Eternal Covenant between the Father and the Son, he was to bear the ſins of his Elect, and under that Condition, it was neceſſary that he ſhould ſuffer for them: It was the Love of the Father to accept of Chriſt to bear the ſins of the People; and it was his Juſtice that diſcloſed his Anger againſt Sin, although his Son did but repreſent the ſinner, and yet the merit of this Suffering hath its ſtrength from the free accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:50435:128"/>
of his Father, according to his Eternal Covenant with his Son.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. From hence it follows, that it is <hi>a Full and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Satisfaction.</hi> The reaſon is, becauſe the meaſure of the Satisfaction is the Acceptation of the offended God: for it appears before, that there can be no other Meaſure or Rule to him but his own Will, though that be a moſt Juſt Will. Now that God was fully ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and pleaſed in Chriſt, we have the Teſtimony of Angels: <hi>Luke</hi> 2.14. <hi>On earth peace, good will to men:</hi> Of Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 17.4. when by way of Anticipation, he ſaith, <hi>I have finiſhed the work that thou gaveſt me to do:</hi> which he fully perfected, when <hi>John</hi> 19.30. he ſaid, <hi>It is finiſhed:</hi> By the eternal Father, by a voice from Heaven, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.17. <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed:</hi> By the Spirit of Truth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.14. <hi>By one offering he hath perfected for ever them that be ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</hi> And from the ſufficiency of this ſatisfaction doth ariſe that aſſurance in which the Apoſtle glories, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of God's Elect,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>it is Chriſt that died:</hi> And hence called the Author and Finiſher of our Faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. It was an <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal</hi> Suffering: The ſin of Man had an univerſal Contagion both upon his Body and Soul, and an univerſal Guilt, and conſequently an univerſal Curſe went over both his Soul and Body; <hi>In the day that thou eateſt, thou ſhalt die the death.</hi> This death extended to his Body and Soul, and the whole <hi>Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitum,</hi> his very Life was mingled with Death, both in Senſe and Expectation. And anſwerable to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of this Contagion, Guilt, and Curſe, was the extent of Chriſt's Satisfaction, who was figured by the firſt <hi>Adam: Rom.</hi> 5.14. His Life was mingled with Pain: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. A Man of ſorrows, and acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with grief: in his Body he ſuffered a curſed and a painful Death: and though the nailing to the Croſs
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:50435:128"/>
was not ſufficient naturally to have made a ſeparation of the Body and Soul, no more than of the two Thieves, yet he had thoſe other Concurrences to his diſſolution that they had not, <hi>viz.</hi> the bearing of his Croſs, <hi>John</hi> 19.17. His ſcourging, and Crown of Thorns: <hi>Matt.</hi> 27.26, 29. But eſpecially the ſuffering of his Soul: the very anticipation of this ſuffering made him even to ſhrink at it, <hi>John</hi> 12.27. <hi>Now is my ſoul troubled: what ſhall I ſay? Father, ſave me from this hour.</hi> And this, like the Trumpet upon <hi>Sinai,</hi> waxed louder and louder, till his very diſſolution; witneſs his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation: In the Garden of <hi>Gethſemane,</hi> Matth. 26.28. <hi>My ſoul is exceeding ſorrowful even unto death:</hi> and that aſtoniſhing Cry of the Son of God upon the Croſs, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.46. <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> His ſorrow and the ſuffering of his Soul in the Garden, that was ſo ſtrange, as to cauſe a ſweat of Blood, had been enough, without the interpoſition of any outward force, to have cauſed his diſſolution, for it was a ſorrow unto death, had not God ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Humane Nature with a ſupernatural aid, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.43. <hi>An angel from heaven ſtrengthened him:</hi> and when the Divine Diſpenſation withdrew that extraordinary ſupply, he died: <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.50. <hi>He cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghoſt:</hi> If it be asked, What was the cauſe of this extremity of ſuffering in the Soul of Chriſt: we ſay, as he willingly took upon him to ſtand in our room to bear our ſins, and to become Sin for us; ſo he felt the wrath of God againſt that ſin, which he by way of imputation did bear: as he bare our ſins in his own Body on the Tree, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. and God laid on him the iniquity of us all: and as he was made ſin for us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. ſo he trode the wine-preſs of his Fathers wrath for that time, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.3. and was made a Curſe for that Sin. The Guilt that he had was not inherent but imputed, but the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:50435:129"/>
ſenſe of that wrath of God againſt Sin, was not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, but real and inherent. If it be inquired, How could ſuch a ſenſe of the wrath of God be conſiſtent with that union that was between his Natures in one Perſon? ſuch Knowledge is too wonderful for me: Nevertheleſs thus far we may ſay, that as in the higheſt extremity of the ſuffering of his Soul, there was no interruption of that ſtrict Union between the Humane and Divine Nature, yet ſo it pleaſed God to order this great Work, that the actual communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the preſence of the Divine Nature, was to the ſenſe of the Humane Nature eclipſed; the Sun ſtill remained in the Firmament, yet the Light thereof Eclipſed at the time of the death of Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.45. to ſhadow to us that interruption of Viſion which was in our Redeemer, that ſo his Soul might be made an Offering for Sin, as well as his Body: If it be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, How it came to paſs, that a perpetual Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due to Man, was expiated by a temporary ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of Chriſt? we anſwer, Man's ſuffering muſt needs be perpetual, becauſe it could never be ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.26. <hi>Thou ſhalt not come out, till thou payeſt the uttermoſt farthing:</hi> But Chriſt's ſuffering was ſatisfactory, and the ſatisfaction being made, the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering could not continue: 1. It was a Voluntary Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering. 2. An Innocent Suffering. 3. A Suffering of the Son of God. 4. An Accepted Satisfaction by the offended God.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. That Chriſt, having ſuffered death, did <hi>ariſe again</hi> from death the third day. This was that which the Prophet <hi>David</hi> foretold of Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.10. <hi>Thou wilt not leave my ſoul in grave:</hi> by Iſa. 53.10. <hi>When thou ſhalt make his ſoul an offering for ſin,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>He ſhall prolong his days, he ſhall divide the ſpoil with the ſtrong, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he poured out his ſoul unto death:</hi> prefigured by <hi>Jonah,</hi> and ſo expounded by Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.40.
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:50435:129"/>
and predicted by himſelf, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.13. <hi>And the third day ſhall riſe again:</hi> atteſted by an Angel, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.6. <hi>He is riſen, as he ſaid.</hi> And this Truth was that which was the great Means of Converſion, and therefore received the greateſt oppoſition of Devils and Men, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.24. <hi>Acts</hi> 4.10.33. <hi>Acts</hi> 5.30. And as it was the greateſt Caution of the High Prieſt, if it had been poſſible, to falſifie the Prediction of Chriſt concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Reſurrection, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.63, 64. So this was the Truth that they moſt perſecuted, <hi>Acts</hi> 25.19. And being a Truth of that great concernment, was moſt evidenced by the Evangeliſts and Apoſtles, whoſe Buſineſs it was to be Witneſſes of the Reſurrection, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.22. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>per totum;</hi> for by this he was declared to be the Son of God with Power, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.4. And this Reſurrection of Chriſt, muſt of neceſſity fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his Satisfaction: he had taken upon him our Sin, and therefore muſt undergo the Wages due unto it, <hi>viz.</hi> Death: in the very inſtant of his Death he had compleated his Sacrifice and Satisfaction, when he ſaid upon the Croſs, <hi>It is finiſhed,</hi> John 19.30. Yet as it was neceſſary for him to lie under Death ſo long as might convince the Reality of it, ſo it was impoſſible for him to lie longer: the Debt was paid, and he could be no longer detained Priſoner, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.24. <hi>Whom God hath raiſed up, having looſed the pains of death, becauſe it was not poſſible he ſhould be holden of it.</hi> And this Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Chriſt, as it was by the Power of God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.4. He liveth by the Power of God, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.19. The working of his mighty Power, or by the Eternal Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.11. The Spirit of him that rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up Jeſus from the dead, ſo it was the effect of his Juſtice, the Price of Man's Redemption being paid, he was now by the Eternal Covenant of God to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long his days. And hence he is ſaid to be juſtified in the Spirit, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. Even that Spirit, that raiſed
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:50435:130"/>
him up from the dead, did at the ſame time proclaim the compleatneſs of his Satisfaction, and juſtifie the fulfilling of his Undertaking. If Chriſt had not riſen, there had of neceſſity followed theſe two Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, either of which had left us in as bad caſe as he found us.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. It had been then impoſſible, that his Death had been a ſufficient Sacrifice. If he had been detained under Death, the Guilt had ſtill continued undiſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. And hence, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.17. <hi>If Chriſt be not raiſed, your faith is vain, ye are yet in your ſins.</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, If there be no Satisfaction made for your Sins, ye are ſtill in them; If Chriſt be detained under Death, it is evident, the Satisfaction is not made; for the Curſe of the Law continues undiſcharged, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Guilt continues unacquitted: and hence Chriſt's Sacrifice was juſtified by his Reſurrection, ſo are we. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.25. <hi>Who was delivered for our offences, and raiſed again for our juſtification.</hi> And this Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Chriſt was his Victory over Guilt, and Death, and Hell. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.57. The Victory given through Chriſt. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.15. Having ſpoiled Principalities and Powers, he then made a ſhew of them openly.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. It had been impoſſible that the Members of Chriſt could have the benefit, either of the firſt or ſecond Reſurrection: for by reaſon of that Union with their Head they partake of all thoſe conditions whereof their head participates: Crucified with him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. Dead to ſin, and buried with him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3, 6, 8. Live with him, <hi>Galat.</hi> 2.20. Riſe together with him to new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.11, 12. Planted unto the likeneſs of his Reſurrection, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.5. Aſcended with him, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.6. and ſhall riſe again to eternal Happineſs, by virtue only of his Reſurrection, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.14.</p>
                        <p n="9">
                           <pb n="223" facs="tcp:50435:130"/>9. That Chriſt after his Reſurrection did <hi>Aſcend up into Heaven,</hi> where his humane Nature is cloathed with Power and Glory, and Immortality. The Death of our Saviour was atteſted by his three days keeping his Grave: and the Reſurrection was atteſted by all the Evidences that incredulity it ſelf could require for ſatisfaction, becauſe the matter of the greateſt difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to believe, and which being admitted made the whole truth concerning him eaſily credible. Therefore for the clearing of this truth, as he ſpent forty days to conquer the Temptations of the Devil in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſo he ſpent forty days after his Reſurrection to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due the infidelity of mankind to the belief thereof: And during that time uſed all the ſenſible Convictions that might be for the confirming of their belief, that the very Body of Chriſt re-aſſumed his Soul and Life. 1. The Body removed out of the Sepulchre, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.5. <hi>Why ſeek ye the Living among the Dead?</hi> 2. He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared unto them, and becauſe thoſe appearances were accompanied with ſome Circumſtances that might breed jealouſie that it was a finer ſubſtance than a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as his ſudden vaniſhing out of their ſight, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Yet to convince that ſuſpicion, he exhibits his hands and his ſide, eats with them, converſes with them about forty days, <hi>Acts.</hi> 1.3. The Body of Chriſt, being by the power of God made of an Angelical, though not ſpiritual ſubſtance, is taken up into Heaven, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.19. <hi>Luke</hi> 24.57. <hi>Acts</hi> 16.9. where he ſits at the right hand of Glory. <hi>Acts</hi> 3.21. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2. This was that which was figured by the High Prieſt's entring into the Holy of Holies, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.24. and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to the very whole humane Nature of Chriſt: the ſame that aſcended is he that deſcended, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.9. This was the ſaying of Chriſt himſelf, <hi>John</hi> 20.17. <hi>I am
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:50435:131"/>
not yet aſcended to my Father: but go tell my Brethren, I aſcend unto my Father and your Father,</hi> &amp;c. And this is that that our Saviour ſo often inculcates, That the Son of Man ſhall come in his Glory, <hi>&amp;c. Matth.</hi> 25.31. <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.64. To inſinuate that that very humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by which he is denominated Man, ſhould conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in immortality, and appear the laſt day for the judgment of the World. And as by the power of God Man in his purity had been perpetuated to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, and ſo he ſhall be in his Reſurrection, ſo by the power of God the Life of Chriſt's humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhall be perpetuated to everlaſting, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.4. He liveth by the power of God. And this Body of Chriſt, as it is filled with immortality, ſo it is filled with Glory, we ſhall be made like unto his glorious Body, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.21.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. That Chriſt having perfected the work of Man's redemption, and aſcended into Heaven exerciſeth a <hi>threefold Office</hi> for the benefit of his Church and People.</p>
                        <p n="1">1.

                        <p n="3">3. The next inquiry is, <hi>for whom</hi> the Satisfaction of Chriſt was?</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Chriſt did <hi>Intentionally</hi> lay down his Life for the ſins of the Elect of God, <hi>John</hi> 10.15. <hi>I lay down my life for my ſheep:</hi> And theſe Sheep of Chriſt, as they were not confined to one time or age of the World, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to one Nation or company of People, <hi>John</hi> 10.16. <hi>Other ſheep I have, which are not of this fold, viz.</hi> of the Nation of the <hi>Jews.</hi> And thus ſome underſtand, 1 <hi>John</hi> 22. <hi>And not for ours only but alſo for the ſins of the whole world,</hi> uſing [us] &amp; the [world] as a contradiſtinction of

                        <p n="2">2. As Chriſt died Intentionally for the Redemption of the Elect, ſo he died <hi>Effectually</hi> for them; and God hath ſo ordered his Counſels, that thoſe, that he hath appointed to eternal Life, ſhall uſe that means, which he hath appointed to be inſtrumental for the partaking of the Efficacy of his Death, <hi>John</hi> 6.37. <hi>All that the Father giveth me, ſhall come unto me, and him that cometh unto me, I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3.

<pb n="229" facs="tcp:50435:133"/>
not the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> This ſeems to contain theſe two Rules, whereby the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhould be judged: 1. Ignorance and want of Fear of God, for ſuch to whom the Goſpel was not preached: this was unexcuſable ignorance and diſobedience, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20. 2. Unbelief and Diſobedience of the Goſpel of Chriſt: And though this be a high Truth, that is not diſcovered by the Light of Nature, yet being diſcovered, it is an offence, even againſt the Law of Nature, not to believe it, becauſe a moſt high and abſolute Truth. 3. Not to love it, and conſequently obey it, becauſe the means to attain the moſt high and abſolute Good. And as every Sin is an averſion from the chief Good, either to that which is a leſſer, or no Good; ſo it is impoſſible, but the aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from the greateſt Good muſt needs be the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Sin, even by the Rules of ſound Reaſon. Both theſe we find plainly ſet down, <hi>John</hi> 3.36. <hi>He that believeth not the Son, ſhall not ſee life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.</hi> John 3.19. <hi>This is the condemnation, that light came into the world, and men loved darkneſs rather than light:</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, that it is the moſt reaſonable and natural Principle for reaſonable Creatures to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain and obey that Rule, which will conduct them to the higheſt Good, and therefore the condemnation of ſuch as neglect is moſt reaſonable; and the rather, for that this proceeds not originally from Ignorance, but from the Perverſeneſs of the Heart, in preferring Darkneſs before Light. So that as Infidelity is the cauſe of Condemnation, <hi>John</hi> 3.18. So this want of Love of the Light is the great cauſe of Infidelity. And though Man hath put himſelf in that Condition, that he cannot come to Chriſt, or entertain this chiefeſt Good, except the Father draw him, <hi>John</hi> 6.44. Yet this doth neither excuſe him from ſin or guilt, becauſe as in the firſt Man he willingly contracted this diſabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, ſo he doth moſt freely and voluntarily affect it:
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:50435:134"/>
though he ſins neceſſarily in rejecting the Light, yet he ſins voluntarily.</p>
                        <p>Now concerning thoſe ſeveral places in holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture that ſeem to infer the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſality</hi> of an intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Redemption, John</hi> 3.17. <hi>John</hi> 12.47. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.2. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.21. It may be conſiderable whether the intention of thoſe places be, that the Price was ſufficient for all the World, ſo that whoſoever ſhall reject the offered Mercy, ſhall never have this excuſe, that there was not a ſufficiency left for him: Or whether it be meant, that Chriſt by his Death did fully expiate for all that Original Guilt, which was contracted by the Fall of <hi>Adam</hi> upon all Mankind; but for the Actual Offences only of ſuch as believed; that ſo as the voluntary ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> had, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the actual conſent of his Poſterity, made them liable to Guilt; ſo the Satisfaction of Chriſt without any actual application of him, ſhould diſcharge all Mankind from that originally contracted Guilt. Theſe diſquiſitions, though fit, yet are not neceſſary to be known: it is enough for me to know, that if I believe on him, I ſhall not periſh, but have everlaſting Life, <hi>John</hi> 3.16. And that all are invited, and none excluded, but ſuch as firſt exclude themſelves.</p>

                        <p n="4">4. WE come to that <hi>Means</hi> which the Will of God hath appointed <hi>to make this Sacrifice Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual for us.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>God, in his Eternal Counſel foreſeeing the Fall of Man, did from all Eternity covenant, that the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val Word ſhould take upon him Fleſh, and ſhould be an all-ſufficient Mediator between God and Man; and to that End, did furniſh this Mediator with all things neceſſary for ſo great a Work, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.19. <hi>For it pleaſed the Father, that in him ſhould all Fulneſs dwell:</hi> Fulneſs of the Godhead, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.9. <hi>For in him dwelleth all the Fulneſs of the Godhead bodily;</hi> Fulneſs of Grace, <hi>John</hi> 1.16. <hi>For of his Fulneſs we receive Grace for Grace:</hi> Fulneſs of Wiſdom and Knowledge, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.3. <hi>In whom are hid all the treaſures of Wiſdom and Knowledge:</hi> Fulneſs of Perfection, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.13. <hi>The meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt:</hi> A Fulneſs of Life, <hi>John</hi> 1.4. <hi>In him was life, and the life was the light of men,</hi> John 5.27. <hi>As the Father hath life in himſelf, ſo hath he given to the Son to have life in himſelf:</hi> A Fulneſs of Love, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.19. <hi>And to know the love of Chriſt, paſſing knowledge.</hi>

                        <p>All the Promiſes of God are in him, and put into him, as into a Treaſury, and bottomed upon him: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. <hi>In whom all the promiſes of God are yea and Amen.</hi> And this Plenitude of Chriſt was therefore in
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:50435:135"/>
him, that from him it might be communicated ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Exigence of thoſe for whom he was a Mediator; for although the Plenitude of the Divine Nature was abſolute, and no way in reference to the Buſineſs of the Mediatorſhip, yet the communication of that Plenitude to Chriſt, as one Mediator, was in order to his Office. And this Fulneſs of Chriſt was neceſſary to ſupply that Emptineſs which was in Man by ſin: He ſtood in need of a ſea of Love to redeem him, and Chriſt was not without riches of Love and Compaſſion: he had loſt his Life; <hi>The day that thou eateſt, thou ſhalt die the death,</hi> and there was as well a Quickning, as a Living Life in Chriſt to revive him, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.1. <hi>Thoſe who were</hi> formerly <hi>dead in treſpaſſes and ſins hath he quickned,</hi> Coloſ. 3.4. <hi>When Chriſt who is our life ſhall appear:</hi> Man had loſt the whole Image of his Creator; Chriſt, who was the expreſs Image of his Father, re-imprints it again by forming himſelf in us, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him,</hi> Epheſ. 4.24. <hi>Put ye on the New Man which after God is created in righteouſneſs and true ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs:</hi> The nature of Man is corrupted, and Chriſt hath a Magazine of Grace to heal and purge that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, <hi>John</hi> 1.16. <hi>Of his fulneſs we receive grace for grace;</hi> In ſum, Man had loſt his Creator with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite diſtance, and ſo loſt his Happineſs; Chriſt, as the Fulneſs of God dwelt in him bodily, ſo together with him reſtores Man to his Lord, and ſo to his Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.19. <hi>And to know the love of Chriſt that paſſeth knowledge, that ye may he filled with all the fulneſs of God.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Means then of this Fruition is <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion.</hi> The reaſon by which every thing enjoys what it hath, is Union, and the more ſtrict the Union is between the thing that enjoys, and the thing enjoyed: The ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Union is between any thing and its Eſſence; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:50435:135"/>
when Goodneſs is part of the Eſſence, the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the moſt perfect: And it is by vertue of this Union with Chriſt, that all this Fulneſs of Chriſt is conveyed to the Believer.</p>
                        <p>Now as the Fulneſs of Chriſt ariſeth from his Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God, the Fountain of Goodneſs; ſo our Fruition of that Fulneſs ariſeth from our Union with Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 17.23. <hi>I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one.</hi> And this was the great Purpoſe of God in ſending Chriſt. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.10. <hi>That he might gather together in one, all things in Chriſt.</hi> And this Union with Chriſt is frequently expreſſed in the Scripture, in the ſtricteſt terms of Union: converſation of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, <hi>John</hi> 14.23. <hi>We will come unto him, and make our abode with him.</hi> Chriſt formed in them, <hi>Galat.</hi> 4.19. Incorporation with him, eating his Fleſh, and drinking his Blood, <hi>John</hi> 6.53. Inhabiting in them, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.17. Chriſt living in them, <hi>Galat.</hi> 2.20. Part of his very ſubſtance, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.30. <hi>For we are members of his body, of his fleſh, and of his bones:</hi> Partakers of the very Fulneſs of God that is in (him.) <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.19. <hi>That ye may be filled with the fulneſs of God.</hi> Changed into the very Image of Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. Partakers of the Divine Nature, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4.</p>
                        <p>Now we are to conſider, <hi>How this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion is wrought, viz.</hi> By a double act, 1. Of God's part: 2. Of our part.</p>
                        <p>God in the Creation united Man unto himſelf; and Man by his ſin broke that Union, and departed from him; and is he could not, ſo he would never have returned to God again, unleſs God had brought him to himſelf, <hi>John</hi> 6.65. <hi>No man can come unto me, except it were given him of my Father: Now the degrees of thoſe acts, whereby God unites us to him, are,</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>His Eternal Love:</hi> Man by his ſin got away from God as far as he could; and as he loſt his Ability, ſo
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:50435:136"/>
he loſt his Mind to return, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.10. <hi>I heard thy voice, and I was afraid, and I hid my ſelf.</hi> Love is the firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Union; and this Love of God is the firſt foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of our Union to him, <hi>John</hi> 3.16. <hi>For God ſo lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the world,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.10. <hi>Herein is Love, not that we loved him, but that he loved us firſt, and gave his Son to be the propitiation for our ſins,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.19. <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelf:</hi> before the World either wiſht, or thought of that Reconciliation: ſo that it was a free Love, and not drawn out upon any deſert in his Creature.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The ſecond ſtep of the motion towards Union, was the <hi>ſending his Son</hi> to aſſume our Nature, and come unto us. The diſtance between God and his beſt Creature, is eſſentially infinite, becauſe finite with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, bears no proportion: but the diſtance between God and his ſinful Creature, muſt needs be greater, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Creature by his ſin is gone away from God farther than he was in his pure Being. To fill up this infinite diſtance, God and Man is united into one Chriſt by the aſſumption of our Nature: and by this means God is come nearer unto us (as we may ſay) and we in a condition to draw nearer unto him, even in his Son. And thus God hath gathered together all things in one in Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.10.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The third ſtep is by the courſe of his Providence, <hi>conveying the knowledge and uſe of this Mediator unto us.</hi> This is a farther degree of Union; the former was ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifical in our Natures, but this objective and intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                           <hi>viz.</hi> by means proportionable to our Natures and Conditions, providentially diſpoſed, he ſends un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us the relation of our own Condition by Nature, our Duty, our Saviour, his Will, and all thoſe Truths contained in the Book of God: and this Truth he ſets on with Rational Convictions, Prophecies, Miracles, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions, Intreaties; all which nave a rational opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:50435:136"/>
upon our Underſtanding and Wills. This is that which is <hi>the Outward Calling.</hi> And among thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Effectual Truths,</hi> that are conveyed unto us by this Calling, which were either loſt or defaced in Man, theſe are principally diſcovered, and of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal uſe:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>That God is the chiefeſt Good;</hi> and therefore the chiefeſt Object of our Love and Deſire; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth juſtly require the extremity of our purſuit: The enjoyment of this Object is that wherein Mans Felicity conſiſted in his State of Innocence, and muſt in his State of Reſtitution, and this truth once enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained doth render all things elſe inſipid in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of it, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.4. <hi>Hear, O Iſrael, The Lord our God is one Lord, therefore thou ſhalt love</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That he is <hi>a Communicative Good:</hi> for without this the Labour of the Soul would be fruitleſs: For it were impoſſible for a finite Power to reach or overtake an infinite Object, unleſs the Object did exhibit himſelf unto that Power. And herein is the excellence of this call of God, it diſcovers the Free Love of God unto the Soul: So, as the Abſolute Goodneſs of God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gageth us, even in Judgment, to ſeek to be united un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: ſo this Free Love of God engageth us, even in good Nature, as I may ſay, to ſeek him. And the very Entertainment of this truth, ſoundly in the heart, is the Foundation of our Faith and Obedience, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.8. <hi>But God commendeth his Love towards us in that while we were yet Sinners, Chriſt dyed for us:</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, There could not be imagined a more Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring love than this, that he, whom we had injured by our Sins, ſhould yet ſeek the Good of his Creature, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.9. <hi>Herein is Love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us firſt.</hi> This was Love with a Witneſs, That when the Creature, that owed to his Lord the ſtrength of his Love, had broken his Duty, and become a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:50435:137"/>
of his Lord, yet that that God ſhould love ſuch a Creature. And as this Love was thus Free, ſo it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended to all the means of Communicating him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that are imaginable: contriving means to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile us: <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the World unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. God was reconciling when Man thought of nothing but offending: Importunities of reconciliation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. <hi>We pray you in Chriſt's ſtead be reconciled to God.</hi> It were a Miracle of Mercy if ſuch a God ſo offended, and by his Creature, ſhould have accepted a Reconciliation upon the higheſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of his Creature; But for him thus injured, that could not receive a grain of advantage by our Converſion unto him, to change as it were conditions with his Creature, and to importune a Reconciliation from it, There wants conception in us to underſtand it, it is a Love paſſing knowledge: But yet like the waters of the Sanctuary ſtill riſeth higher: It is true, we made our ſelves miſerable, and if thou. O Lord, hadſt never looked after us, nor pitied us, we could never have complained of thy Juſtice: But if thou hadſt pitied, and done no more; or if thy pity had gone ſo far as to have given us a deliverance if we could have found it, we muſt for ever in our miſery have magnified thy Mercy, though we had been Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus'd in the inquiry: <hi>But here is Love, not that we lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved God, but that he loved us, and ſent his Son to be the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation for our Sins:</hi> a Propitiation, and a Propitiation prepared by our offended injured Maker, and ſuch a Propitiation. But it reſts not here; We had incurred Guilt enough to make us wretched, and a delivery from wretchedneſs by ſuch a means had been an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable Mercy: But this mercy reſted not there; he doth not only of miſerable Men make us not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable, by pardoning our Guilt; but of Enemies makes us Children, by a Righteouſneſs, that he
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:50435:137"/>
himſelf had prepared, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.3. <hi>Behold what manner of Love the Father hath beſtowed upon us, that we ſhould be called the Sons of God.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. Now a Man would think that ordinary Prudence and Ingenuity would engage the heart to entertain this Meſſage of Happineſs and Peace with Love and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation; and that a greater approach from God to his Creature, as it could not be expected, ſo it need not be required: The Chiefeſt Good commands our Entertainment, how much more when it offers it ſelf, with ſuch a condeſcenſion, as well to our Neceſſities, as to our conditions! Moral perſwaſions have wrought upon the Tempers of wiſe Men, without any propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of any thing beyond this Life, how much more perſwaſions bottomed upon ſuch ſound Reaſon, and propounding an end ſutable to the higheſt Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of our Souls! But all this will not ſerve the turn unleſs the Mercy of God had gone farther: We are dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins; and we can no more receive theſe Truths, and this Love of God, than a dead Man can receive a rational Impreſſion: Now Chriſt is our Life, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.4. <hi>When Chriſt, who is our Life, ſhall appear,</hi> 1 John 5.12. <hi>He that hath the Son hath Life; he that hath not the Son hath not Life:</hi> Now this Life is wrought in us, and conveyed unto us, by the very <hi>work of the Spirit of God and Chriſt,</hi> in and upon our Souls, <hi>John</hi> 6.63. <hi>It is the Spirit that quickens,</hi> the ſame Spirit that raiſed up Chriſt from the Dead, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.11. <hi>If the Spirit of him that raiſed up Jeſus from the Dead dwell in you, he that raiſed up Chriſt from the Dead, ſhall alſo quicken your Mortal Body by his Spirit that dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in you,</hi> Epheſ. 2.5. <hi>Even when we were dead in Sins, he hath quickned us together with Chriſt.</hi> Therefore he is called the Spirit of Life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.2. This Life called the renewing of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.5. a Birth of the Spirit, <hi>John</hi> 3.5. <hi>Except a Man be born of Water
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:50435:138"/>
and the Spirit,</hi> Verſe 6. <hi>that which is born of the Spirit is Spirit.</hi> The firſt Reſurrection. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.14. <hi>Awake thou that ſleepeſt, ſtand up from the Dead, and Chriſt ſhall give thee Life:</hi> And though it may ſeem a vain Command to a dead Man to ſtand up from the Dead, yet we muſt remember whoſe Command it was, even his that ſpake to dead <hi>Lazarus, Come forth,</hi> and he aroſe, becauſe a Spirit of Life, and a word of Power went along with the Command, <hi>John</hi> 6.63. <hi>The words that I ſpeak unto you, they are Spirit, and they are Life:</hi> They have not only Life in them for him that receives them, but I can ſend a Spirit with them to enable him to receive them. And now the Soul is put into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to entertain his Happineſs. It was the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Soul, and it is the Happineſs of Angelical Natures to be receptive of the knowledge and Love of God: And here was Mans miſery by his Sin, that as he loſt the actual Enjoyment of God, ſo he had made his Soul, as it were, irreceptive of it again: and as God hath offered himſelf to us again in Chriſt, ſo by his Spirit he enables us to receive him by Faith, which is the firſt motion of the Creature to Union with God.</p>
                        <p>So then <hi>the work of the Spirit</hi> upon the Soul comes <hi>under a threefold Conſideration,</hi> though the ſame act produceth all three, and therefore they are three put together 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.7. <hi>The Spirit of Power, of Love, and of a ſound Mind.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Of Power</hi> or Life, whereby Life is conveyed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Soul, which, like the dry bones in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> was void of Life till this Spirit comes into them; <hi>de quae ſupra:</hi> and the two following are but the manifeſtation of this Life according to the Faculties wherein it appears.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Of a ſound Mind,</hi> Light not only in the <hi>Medium</hi> but in the Organ. <hi>John</hi> 1.4. <hi>In him was Life, and the Life was the light of Men.</hi> Hence it is called a convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Spirit, <hi>John</hi> 16.8. a Spirit of Wiſdom and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:50435:138"/>
in the knowledge of Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.17. a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of underſtanding: <hi>He hath given us underſtanding that we may know him that is true.</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.20. a Spirit of Demonſtration and of Power, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.4. a Spirit of diſcerning and Judication, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.15, 16. Man's Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding by his Fall loſt his Object, and loſt his Sight, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.8. <hi>ye were ſometimes darkneſs.</hi> And this was not only a darkneſs by the Abſence, but by the exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of light: the Underſtanding was ſealed againſt it, ſo that though light did ſhine in the darkneſs, yet the darkneſs comprehended it not, <hi>John</hi> 1.5. Now here was the work of the Spirit of God in opening the heart, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.14. enabling our underſtanding to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and ſubduing of it to believe the truth of God. And this is certain, not only in thoſe truths, which are fartheſt removed from our Reaſon, and ſo moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the Object of our Faith, <hi>John</hi> 6.65. <hi>No man can come unto me except the Father draw him,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.3. <hi>No man can ſay that Jeſus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> But even in thoſe points of truth, wherein even natural reaſon may guide us: Even the belief of the Creation, though it is deducible by natural reaſon to know it, yet it is the work of Faith to believe it: <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.3. <hi>By Faith we underſtand that the Worlds were framed,</hi> &amp;c. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of the ſame truth by the work of the Spirit of God creating Faith, and the work of Natural Reaſon working Opinion, or at moſt knowledge, differs as much as knowledge and Opinion: Thoſe things of God, that are diſcoverable by natural Reaſon, receive another kind of impreſſion upon the Soul by the work of God, as is evident by the Effects and Operations each have upon the Soul, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.21. <hi>When they knew God, yet they glorified him not as God.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>Of Love,</hi> therefore ſo called, becauſe the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal part of the Meſſage that the Soul is acquainted with, is a Meſſage of Love and Goodneſs, and ſo the
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:50435:139"/>
Will inclined and ingaged to love that Goodneſs. And this is the fruit of the work of God's Spirit.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Mediately and naturally, preſuppoſing the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer work of Illumination: for ſome Objects are of ſo light a nature, that when they are known, all the work of the Soul is done; ſo they are only known, that they may be known: But theſe objects of our Faith, they do include a Goodneſs and Conveniency for the Soul; and therefore being known, they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired; ſo that in natural Conſequence, the Spirit of God, if it demonſtrates theſe Truths to the Soul, it doth by conſequence engage the Love of the Soul to them. It is true, that Education, Inſtruction, and Diſcipline, may make us know theſe Truths ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, and yet our Soul not affected with them: but the Conviction, which is wrought by the Power of God's Spirit, is not ſo thin or jejune a union of theſe Truths to the underſtanding, but deeper and more ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated; and conſequently doth more effectually work upon the Will: and therefore it is the Logick of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.4. <hi>He that ſaith he knoweth God, and keepeth not his Commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.9. <hi>He that lacketh theſe things is blind, and cannot ſee.</hi> The Argument is from the Negation of the neceſſary Effect or Conſequent, to the Negation of the Cauſe or Antecedent: as if he ſhould have ſaid, Whereſoever there is no true Obedience to the Will and Command of God, there is certainly no Love of God. It is the concluſion of Truth and Reaſon, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.23. <hi>If a man love me, he will keep my words:</hi> And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever there is a true knowledge of God, there muſt of neceſſity be a true Love unto God, becauſe it doth repreſent God as the chiefeſt, only, and moſt ſuitable Good to the Soul. It is true, that notional and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative knowledge of God, that is wrought by natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral diſcourſe, cannot, or at leaſt ſeldom doth, arrive
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:50435:139"/>
to that full apprehenſion of the Goodneſs of God; and conſequently doth not raiſe up the Heart to that height of Love and Obedience: for our Reaſon is weak, and the diſproportion between Him and our Underſtanding, is infinite; and therefore he hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen to reveal it unto us in his Word and Son, and by his own Power working Knowledge in us.</p>
                        <p>And by this we ſee why the renovation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion unto God is ſometimes expreſſed under the name of Knowledge, <hi>John</hi> 17.3. <hi>This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God,</hi> &amp;c. Coloſ. 3.10. <hi>Having put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.6. <hi>For God, who commanded the light to ſhine out of darkneſs, hath ſhined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times under the name of Truſting and depending upon God, <hi>Galat.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for Righteouſneſs:</hi> ſometimes under the name of Love, <hi>Jud.</hi> 21. <hi>Keep your ſelves in the Love of God,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.14. <hi>with faith and love which is in Chriſt,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.13. 2 Theſ. 2.10. Receiving the Love of the Truth: ſometimes under the name of Obedience: <hi>James</hi> 1.27. <hi>Pure religion and undefiled,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>James</hi> 2. <hi>per tot.</hi> 1 John 2.29. <hi>Every one that doth righteouſneſs is born of him:</hi> ſo ſometimes under the name of Repentance: Fear of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For all this is but one work of this Spirit of Grace; and but the ſeveral Emanations of the ſame work of the Spirit of God upon the Soul, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſified only in the faculties or objects: the firſt act in Nature is Light; and when it convinceth the heart of the ſinfulneſs of ſin that works Repentance; when of the Promiſes of God, that breeds Dependence and Confidence; when of the Goodneſs and Love of God in Chriſt, that breeds Love unto him Watchfulneſs over our ſelves, Obedience to his Will; when of the Majeſty and Juſtice of God, it breeds Fear and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence;
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:50435:140"/>
when of our own vileneſs, it breeds Humility: ſo that all theſe are but the bringing home, and joyning of thoſe Convictions wrought in our Underſtanding unto the Will and Affections; and thereupon theſe Effects do as naturally follow upon this work of Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination and Conviction wrought by the Spirit of God, as the like Effects do ariſe upon natural convictions of Objects of inferiour kinds and goodneſs.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. But this is not all, there is a work of ſtrength and power <hi>upon the Will,</hi> Phil. 2.13. <hi>It is God that worketh in you, both to will, and to do, of his good pleaſure.</hi> As the death and diſability was in both Faculties, ſo the Life is conveyed into both univerſally. And this Power of God's Spirit is not only in the firſt acts of our Converſion to him, but it goes along with us: All thoſe actions which are pleaſing to God, are wrought by the ſame Spirit of Chriſt, by which they were at firſt animated. It is a Spirit of Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in our Prayers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. <hi>The Spirit maketh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion,</hi> &amp;c.

                        <p>HITHERTO we have ſeen the motion of the Love of God to his Creature; by which it may appear, the whole Buſineſs of Man's Salvation is the work of God; and Man appears in a manner paſſive in all the parts of it: In the ſending Light into his Underſtanding he is paſſive; In the enabling the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to receive this Light, he is ſtill paſſive; In the ſubduing the Will to the entertainment of it, he is ſtill paſſive: Yet there is ſome kind of <hi>motion in us;</hi> which though it be the Work of our Creator in the firſt giving of it; and again<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                                 <desc>•</desc>

                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Faith,</hi> which is taken in a double ſenſe:</p>
                        <p n="1">
                           <pb n="244" facs="tcp:50435:141"/>1. For that firm and ſound Aſſent of the Mind to Divine Truths, wrote by the Spirit of God; and ſo differs little or nothing from ſupernatural Knowledge; and thus, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1. <hi>Faith is the evidence of things not ſeen;</hi> and hath for its Objects, all Divine Truths. And as Chriſt dwells in our Hearts by Faith thus taken, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.17. ſo other Truths dwell in the Heart by this Faith, <hi>viz.</hi> objectively: ſo that Faith thus taken, is more properly an act upon the Soul, than an act of it: for in our Aſſent to any Truth, our Soul is in truth, paſſive; the ſtrength of the Conviction conquers the Soul.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. For that motion of the Soul, whereby it reſts, caſts and adventures it ſelf upon the Promiſes of God in Chriſt for Remiſſion and Salvation; and ſo differs from the former, in theſe three reſpects:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. In the Latitude of its Object; it is more reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than the former.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. In the Order of its Being; it is ſubſequent in the Order of Nature to the former, and produced by it.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. In the Manner of its working. In the work of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Knowledge or Aſſent, the Soul is paſſive: in this, though it be the work of God, yet the Soul is more active; As the Sun, when it ſhines upon a ſolid Body, doth cauſe a reflection of his own bea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>s; ſo when the Light of Grace falls upon the Heart in this ſpecial act of Faith, as in that or Love, there is a reflection from the Soul back to God. And therefore thoſe Expreſſions of Faith in the Scripture, import a motion in the Soul: Chriſt comes into the Soul by his Light and Spirit; and the Soul again comes to Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.45. <hi>He that hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me.</hi> As Chriſt abides in the Heart by the former act of Faith; ſo by this latter, the Soul abides and incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates into him, and both theſe we have joyned together, <hi>John</hi> 15.4. <hi>Abide in me, and I in you.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="245" facs="tcp:50435:141"/>Now this act of the Soul, is the moſt natural reſult upon the true diſcovery of a Man's own Condition, God's promiſe, and Chriſt's mediation unto the Soul. When a Man finds, that the Sentence of Death is paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon him; that nevertheleſs, God in infinite Love and Mercy, hath ſent his Son to be his Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Righteouſneſs; and hath promiſed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed by him, and in him, and only by him, Peace and Reconciliation, and that without exception of any perſon, though laden with never ſo much guilt and ſin; and without any difficult Conditions: <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever believeth on him, ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life.</hi> John 3.16. John 6.40. That he is appointed a Sacrifice by him whom we offended, <hi>John</hi> 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the world,</hi> &amp;c. The Son of God, and <hi>able to ſave to the uttermoſt them that come unto God by him, Heb.</hi> 7.25. The moſt genuine and natural motion of the Soul in ſuch a condition, and thus convinced, is Truſt, Affiance, and Divolution of the Soul upon this Promiſe of God in Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>And it is an obſervable thing, how the Wiſe and Merciful Providence of God hath ordered all things ſo, that we might be even neceſſitated to the right way of our Salvation, and to caſt our ſelves upon it: All were concluded under a common guilt, by the volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry offence of <hi>Adam,</hi> Rom. 5.12. And if we could derive our Being from another, then we might eſcape the Guilt: and that Guilt brought with it Death in the World, both eternal and temporal, bound upon us by irreverſible Sentence of an omnipotent God. But cannot I by my future obedience, emerit this guilt? No. What thou doeſt for the future, is but thy Duty, and thou canſt not out-act it: But grant thy future obedience might ſatisfie for the guilt under which thou lieſt, thou ſhalt have the Copy of that Rule which I required from thee, and once enabled thee to perform, <hi>Do this
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:50435:142"/>
and live:</hi> But be ſure thou do it, without turning to the right hand or the left, with thy whole Might, and Mind, and Soul, without the leaſt averſion; and that out of the meer Principle of Love and Duty, and Obedience; and thy future obſervance may expiate that original guilt: yet our Condition had been ſtill d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

So we find an univerſal Guilt and Curſe gone over all, and all this diſcovered to drive us to a Saviour, <hi>Galat.</hi> 3.22, <hi>The Scripture hath concluded all under a ſin, that the promiſe by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>aith of Jeſus Chriſt might be given to them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</hi> We find a righteous Law given to our Nature, but as the Obedience is unſatisfactory for a paſt Guilt, ſo the Obſervance is become impoſſible, by reaſon of our Corruption whereby our diſobedience is rather excited than abated, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.8. <hi>When the commandment came, ſin revived, and I died:</hi> And all this ſtill to drive us to the neceſſity of a Saviour, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.12. <hi>What the law could not do, in that it was weak through the fleſh, God ſending his own Son in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh, and for ſin condemned ſin in the fleſh.</hi> Thus in the midſt of all thoſe difficulties, a Saviour preſents himſelf with the ſuffrage of God, the atteſtation of Types and Prophecies, with reconciliation of all the difficulties which perplexed our Inquiries, with Ability to ſave to the uttermoſt, with Mercy, and Acceptation, and Pardon, and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Happineſs, offered and proclaimed to all, and that upon moſt unhazardable and eaſie terms, only believe him, and truſt on him. So then Faith is nothing elſe but that reſult of dependance upon, and confidence in, and adherence unto Chriſt, which follows upon the ſound Conviction of the Truth of God concerning him. It is true, the Faith of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:50435:142"/>
differed much in the diſtinctneſs of its acting and object, from the Faith which is now required; as <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith, <hi>Caleb</hi>'s Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But in this, they both agreed, 1. That it was a Confidence, and Truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon God, in that which was revealed unto them by God. The Promiſes of a Son was made to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and he reſted upon God for the performance: The Promiſe of <hi>Canaan</hi> to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Caleb</hi> and the believing <hi>Jews</hi> reſted upon the Power and Truth of God to perform it: So with us, God hath promiſed Mercy and Happineſs to them that believe on Chriſt, the Soul reſteth and truſteth in the Truth and Power of God in Chriſt for it: 2. In that the Faith of both had a termination in Chriſt, though theirs more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinctly and confuſedly, in reſpect that the ſame was not ſo clearly revealed unto them. In that Promiſe to <hi>Abraham, In thee ſhall all nations of the earth be bleſſed;</hi> wherein the Goſpel was preached to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Galat. 3.8. <hi>Abraham</hi> did ſee Chriſt, and rejoyced, <hi>John</hi> 8.56. And ſo for the reſt of thoſe ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.4. <hi>They drank of that ſpiritual rock that followed them, and that rock was Chriſt:</hi> Now the <hi>Effects of Faith</hi> are of two kinds:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. In reference to God, our Juſtification; God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of his free Goodneſs exhibited the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt and his Satisfaction to be theirs, that ſhall truly know it, and reſt upon it, <hi>Rom.

                        <p n="1">1. By the Knowledge of God, as he is the Beſt and Univerſal Good: and therefore it is impoſſible, that there can be the true Knowledge of God, but there muſt be the true Love of God, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.8. <hi>He that loveth not, knoweth not God:</hi> And this is an Act grounded upon a rational Judgment, which even by the very Law and Rule of Nature teacheth us to value and eſteem that moſt, which is the greateſt Good.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. By the Knowledge of the Love of God to us. The abſolute Goodneſs of God deſerves our Love; but the communication of his Goodneſs to his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture commands it: The former doth moſt immediately work upon our Judgment, and ſo is a love of Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion; the latter upon our Wills, and ſo is a love of Affection; and yet both upon right Reaſon, for as the Law of Nature teacheth us to love the Chiefeſt Good, ſo the ſame Law of Nature teacheth us to love thoſe moſt, that do us moſt Good, and conſequently love us moſt. Now when God by his Spirit ſheds abroad his Love into the Heart; and we once come to know the Love of Chriſt paſſing Knowledge, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.19. The Soul, even out of a natural ingenuity (being
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:50435:144"/>
reſcued by the Spirit of God from that malignity that ſin and corruption had wrought in it) cannot chuſe but return to God again, that hath done ſo much for ſo undeſerving a Creature. And therefore this was the great Wiſdom and Goodneſs of God in ſending Chriſt in the Fleſh to die for us when we were Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and in revealing that Goodneſs of his therein; that in a way, proportionable to the conception and operation of our Souls, we might underſtand the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Love to us: 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.16. <hi>Hereby perceive we the love of God,</hi> 1 John 4.9. <hi>In this was manifeſted the love of God,</hi> Epheſ. 2.4. <hi>But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love, wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>God commandeth his love to us,</hi> &amp;c.

When the Soul is convinced of ſo much Love from ſo great a God to ſo poor a Creature, in very Ingenuity and Gratitude it cannot chuſe but return an humble and hearty Love to his Creator again. Methinks the Soul in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of the Goodneſs and Love of God, might beſpeak it ſelf to this effect: So immenſe and infinite is the Goodneſs and Beauty of thy God, that were thy Being poſſible to be independent upon him, he would deſerve the moſt boundleſs and infinite motion of thy Love unto him: But here is yet farther infinitude ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to an infinitude: he gave thee thy Being from no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, which was an infinite act of his Goodneſs and Power unto thee, and doth and may juſtly challenge the higheſt tribute of Love and Glory, that thy Being can return unto him: But had he given thee a ſimple
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:50435:144"/>
Being, thy Debt had not been ſo great, ſo have the moſt unaccompliſht Creatures: But thy Being was dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with an Intellectual Nature, and that Nature fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with Fruition of Happineſs, filling the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt extent of its Capacity, and that Happineſs guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſuch a Law as was ſuitable to that Nature, full of Beauty and Order, in the obedience whereof, thou didſt at once perform thy Duty, and improve thy Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: But thou rejectedſt all this, and becameſt a Rebel to thy God, and a ruine to thy ſelf, and thou haſt improved thy ruine and rebellion by a voluntary rejection of thy Duty and thy Happineſs, until this hour: And what canſt thou expect, but a juſt return of an infinite Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from an omnipotent injured Creator, for ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful a breach of an infinite Obligation? But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what thy Lord hath done for thee for all this, and ſtay thy ſelf and wonder: Thy Lord proclaims, Return, thou backſliding Soul, and I will not cauſe mine anger to fall upon you, <hi>Jer.</hi> 12. Hadſt thou of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended thine Equal, for thy offended Equal to have ſolicited thy Reconciliation, had deſerved Acceptation and Love; But for the infinite God, to whom thou oweſt an infinite Duty; and haſt violated it, who is able to annihilate thee, and can receive no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage by thy return, to ſolicit it with an offer of a Reprieve, nay, of a Pardon! But here's not all: our Deliverance from the Wrath of God, is wonder e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough: <hi>Let me now be as one of my Father's hired Servants.</hi> No, there is more yet, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.1. <hi>Behold what manner of love:</hi> he is content to accept of us as Sons. But what muſt the Price be of ſo great a Change, or who ſhall give it? Thy Lord, whom thou haſt thus injured, hath paid the Price of thy Redemption, and ſuch a Price as Heaven and Earth may wonder at the mention of it. The Son of God lays down his Life for his Rebels. Pardon, and Aſſumption into a Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerſhip
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:50435:145"/>
with him in his own Kingdom: But thou art not for all this, at the End of thy Debt, this Price is rendred to thee upon eaſie terms, Believe and live: and this Life accompanied with infinite Advantages, even Communion with this Creator. But yet like the murmuring <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> thou wilt die with the Manna between thy Teeth, unleſs God, who hath given thee ſuch a Price of thy Redemption, enable thee to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him: He ſends his Spirit into thy Heart, with Light and Life, to ſtrive with thy unbelieving Heart, and to ſubdue it, and to cleanſe thy filthy and pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Heart, to bring Redemption into thy Heart, and to ſolicite, perſwade, importune thy Heart to receive him for thy own Good. What remains then, but that thou ſhouldeſt ever admire that Love, that hath done all this for thee, that thou ſhouldeſt in all humility and humble reverence return love to thy Lord, and magnifie his condeſcenſion, that he is pleaſed to accept the Love of his poor Creature; that thou ſtudy not to grieve the Spirit of that God, that hath taken this pains and care with thee for thy good; not to crucifie again that Chriſt, that hath died for thee; that thou labour to find out what is the Will of thy Lord; and to obey it; and to <hi>walk in love, as Chriſt alſo loved us, and hath given himſelf for us,</hi> Epheſ. 5.2.</p>
                        <p>Now according to the meaſure of the true Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, and of his Love in Chriſt, is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of our Love to him: and as that Knowledge is the immediate cauſe of its production, ſo it muſt of neceſſity be the meaſure of its Degree. And although both the knowledge of his Abſolute Goodneſs, which excites the love of Deſire, and the knowledge of his Benefactorineſs to us, which increaſeth the love of Gratitude or Benevolence, are mingled in every Soul that truly loves God; yet according to the different degrees of the diſcoveries of either to the Soul, ſo are
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:50435:145"/>
the different manners of their working upon the Soul. The knowledge of the Perfection and Abſolute Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God is more ſuitable to an Angelical Nature, and therefore produceth an high Angelical and Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual Love; for this Love begins with the Judgment: But becauſe our Nature, as it now ſtands, as it arrives ſeldom to ſuch a Knowledge, ſo ſeldom to ſuch a Love; and that Love, which comes into the Heart, meerly upon ſuch Contemplations, is weak, mingled with Servile Fear; unactive, becauſe the Knowledge like the Sun in a Cloud, ſhines dim, and the Heat proves wateriſh and weak: But the knowledge of the Goodneſs of God to us, as it draws the Goodneſs of God nearer to us in Senſe, ſo it ſtrikes more our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, which God hath placed in us for this End. And this was the motive of Love, and conſequently of Obedience, both under the Law, and under the Goſpel; though the Expreſſions of that Love under the Law had more in them of Senſe, and under the Goſpel, more of Spirit, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.20. <hi>That thou mayeſt love the Lord thy God, and obey his voice, and cleave unto him, for he is thy life, and the length of thy days,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.47. <hi>Her ſins, which are many, are forgiven, for ſhe loved much.</hi> Chriſt argues from the meaſure of her Love, to the meaſure of God's Goodneſs to her, and her Senſe of it. And here we have <hi>the true Principle of all true Obedience to God:</hi> The bare External act of any thing commanded by God, unleſs it move from a Heart or Principle conformable to the Will of God, is no Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: for all External actions, taking them divided from the Will, they are all of one kind and nature: The very ſame act proceeding from a Soul differently principled, may be an act of Obedience, (<hi>viz.</hi> when proceeding from an obedient loving Heart;) an act of compulſion, when proceeding from a bare ſervile Heart; a bruitiſh act, when it proceeds from a Soul
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:50435:146"/>
not moved with any Conſideration; and an act of malignity againſt God, when done out of a malicious cunning deſign. Some even preached the Goſpel for Envy, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.16. So then, as the Knowledge of the Goodneſs and Love of God to us, is the immediate cauſe of the return of our Love to God; ſo this love of the Soul unto God, is the true and immediate Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of all true Obedience unto God, Now theſe are the genuine and natural <hi>Effects of Love to God:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. It makes a Man, <hi>to make God and his Honour and Glory, the higheſt and ſupream End</hi> of all his actions. And this muſt needs be ſo in Reaſon: For as the great End of all the works of God are his own Honour; ſo where there is true Love to God, it cannot chuſe but make the Soul value that moſt, which God moſt values. As he muſt needs be convinced in his Judgment, that that which God makes his End, muſt needs be the chief End of the Creatures actions; ſo where this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is, it muſt needs drive to that End: for if it ſhould in any thing go beſide that End, or not aim at it, there is ſo much want of Love, My Love to a Creature may conſiſt with a croſſing of the End of that Creature out of my very love to it, becauſe the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which I love, may drive to an End, which is not for his own good: but this is impoſſible in caſe of my Love to God; for whatſoever moſt tends to his Glory, is moſt conformable to his Will, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is conformable to his Will, is moſt infallibly conformable to the ſoundeſt and beſt Wiſdom.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. It makes the Heart <hi>Conformable unto the Will of God:</hi> for he that loves God truly, makes his Will the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his own: and it is impoſſible to think that a Creature ſhould love God truly, and yet croſs the Will of him whom he thus loves. The Perfection of all Creatures, even inanimate, conſiſts in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the Will and Law of their Creator, ſtampt
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:50435:146"/>
upon them in their Creation; and when they turn aſide from this, they contract Diſorder and Defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity; much more in caſe of a rational Creature, who is endued with Faculties ſuſceptive and executive of the Will of God in a higher meaſure. And the <hi>Fruits of this Conformity</hi> to the Will of God are,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. A chearful Submiſſion to the actings of the Will of God upon us with Patience and Contentedneſs; for it is his Will, whoſe Will I have made the meaſure of mine: and though I ſhall not ceaſe to make my humble application to him for the removing of his Hand of what kind ſoever, yet I have learned of my Saviour to conclude, <hi>Not my will, but thy will be done.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. A ſolicitous inquiry what this Will of God is; for the ſame Love, that teacheth me to make his Will mine, teacheth me likewiſe to make inquiry after, this Will by my Prayers, by my Studies, and Inquiries <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. A ſtrict walking according to that Will, in all things, and at all times.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. This Love of God works <hi>an awful Converſation and Heart</hi> before him. And this is that <hi>Fear of God</hi> which the wiſe Man tells us is the great duty of Man, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.13. Now the Fear of God may <hi>ariſe</hi> upon ſome of theſe Conſiderations:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Out of the meer Senſe of a Guilt incurred, and the Power and Wrath of God againſt the guilty Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Such was the fear of <hi>Adam</hi> before God had revealed the Cure of his Guilt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.10. <hi>I heard thy voice in the garden and was afraid:</hi> and this fear drives the Heart from God, and therefore he hid himſelf: and therefore this Fear in the perfection of it, is not conſiſtent with the Love of God; though ſo much of imperfection as our love unto God hath, ſo much even of this Fear may be in the Soul, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. <hi>We have not received the ſpirit of bondage again to fear.</hi> 1 John. 4.18. <hi>He that feareth is not made perfect in Love.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">
                           <pb n="256" facs="tcp:50435:147"/>2. Out of the mere ſenſe of the Majeſty, and Glory, and Power of God, and the ſubordination and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection and diſtance of the Creature. And ſuch a Fear as this, as it may conſiſt, ſo it ought to be joined unto our Love of God. And, although there were in us an impoſſibility to ſin, as in Angelical Natures, or bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Souls, yet this Awfulneſs and Reverence to his Majeſty will be, and muſt be in us: for all the Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions of God muſt be received with anſwerable Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections in his Creature, and one hinders not the other. And this awe of the Majeſty of God in the Heart ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth it ſelf in ſuitable Deportments and Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons without. <hi>Abraham,</hi> that was the Friend of God, yet forgets not his diſtance in his Prayer, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.27. <hi>Behold, now I have taken upon me to ſpeak to the Lord, which am but duſt and aſhes.</hi> Exod. 34.6. When God paſſed by <hi>Moſes,</hi> he proclaimed his Majeſty and Glory, as well as his Mercy and Goodneſs: <hi>The Lord, The Lord God, Merciful,</hi> &amp;c. And it found a ſuitable affection of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence in <hi>Moſes;</hi> he bowed his Head towards the Earth, and worſhipped. Even when we rejoyce in him, it muſt be with Trembling, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.11. And this is a great part of the Buſineſs of the Old Teſtament to acquaint revolting Man with the Majeſty of God, and to fence out thoſe irreverent and unbecoming thoughts that the degenerate Sons of Men had of the infinite God, <hi>Iſa</hi> 40. <hi>per totum,</hi> &amp; <hi>Verſ.</hi> 18. <hi>To whom then will ye liken God?</hi> And as the Angels in awful reverence to his Majeſty, are ſaid to cover their Faces, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.2.) ſo the twenty four Elders that ſat about the Throne, caſt down their Crowns before the Throne, <hi>
                              <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p n="3">3. Out of a ſenſe of his Goodneſs, mingled with the conſideration of his Greatneſs; which doth at once improve the value of his Mercy, that it ſhould come from ſo great a Majeſty; and improve that Fear of
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:50435:147"/>
his Greatneſs, by mixing with an humble Love, the Love of a Child to a Father. And this is moſt ſeen in the care of avoiding any thing, which may diſpleaſe God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Paſſing the ſojourning here in fear.</hi> This is that that makes them watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and jealous of themſelves, leſt any thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſeeming ſo great an Engagement ſhould paſs from them. This Caution againſt Sin, riſeth from the Love of God under both the notions before expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. As our Love is terminated in him, as the Chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Good: and ſo we avoid ſin out of fear of that loſs, which we may have by it. This, it is true, is not without a mixture of Love to our ſelves, yet allowable to be a ground of our Care.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. As our Love returns to him by way of Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence: Where Love is to an Equal, it creates an awe of giving diſtaſte. How much more, when to the infinite God, and yet that ſo far condeſcends in his Love to us.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. This Love of God breeds an <hi>endeavour of Likeneſs to him.</hi> The genuine effect of Love, is Union: and Similitude to the thing loved, hath a degree of Union in it. Now becauſe no Eye can ſee God and live, neither can there be that proportion between us and him, that we ſhould frame our ſelves unto his Image immediately, he hath given us three Copies of himſelf to take out, <hi>viz.</hi>

                        <p n="2">2. A <hi>Perpetual Obedience,</hi> becauſe the Principle within is perpetual and increaſing: for the more a Man loves God, the more God is pleaſed to diſcover his Goodneſs to him; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his Love increaſeth, and conſequently his Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>

                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Obedience;</hi> for it is the ſame Principle within, that looks univerſally upon all. The Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is upon this ground. It is the Will, and the Command of him whom I love, that ingageth my Obedience: and whereſoever I find that impreſſion, there is my ground: If the thing commanded, be more unſuitable to my Conſtitution, Occaſions, Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies, yet it hath the Impreſſion of my Lord up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, I will by his ſtrength and Grace obey it: If I love him, his Will, and not my own, muſt be the meaſure of my Obedience. And this is the reaſon why the breach of one Command of God know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, is the breach of all, becauſe, if my Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the reſt, had been rightly principled upon the Love of God, the ſame Love would have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged me to the obedience of this: my Obedience therefore to the reſt, is not Obedience, but a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence or Shew. Some Commandments of God do include in them a greater ſuitableneſs to the Rational Nature of Man than others; ſuch are the Laws of Nature, the Decalogue: ſome are ſuch Commands, as ſeem only to be Experiments of our Obedience; ſuch were the Ceremonial Commands; the Command to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to ſacrifice his Son;
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:50435:149"/>
to the Young Man, to ſell all he had: But where this true Principle of the Love of God is there will follow Obedience to both; though the more hard the Command, the greater meaſure of Love to God is required to a full performance of it. It teaches Obedience, where the thing commanded, is of it ſelf full of Beauty, as all Moral Commands are, becauſe but the Abſtract of his Image: and it teacheth to obey where the Command ſeems to carry nothing in it, but aſperity, and unuſefulneſs; for it hath made the Will of God the meaſure of its own Will.

And when we ſpeak of Faith, we muſt not intend that work of the Spirit of God in our Souls, whereby we believe; for by the very ſame work is wrought belief, love of God, and hope in him: But it is that act of that Life ſo wrought, which doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. Now we ſhall conſider, <hi>Why, or by what reaſon the act of Faith worketh our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with Chriſt, and ſo our Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi> in the ſight of God:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Becauſe it is <hi>the Will of God,</hi> John 6.40. <hi>This is the will of him that ſent me, that every one which ſeeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlaſting life:</hi> He, that is the great diſpenſer of his own Goodneſs, is pleaſed that this ſhall be the means of that Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In ancient times before the coming of Chriſt, he was pleaſed to uſe other immediate Inſtruments, ſuch were Circumciſion, Obedience to thoſe Laws which he gave: theſe had not their Efficacy of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, for they were indifferent things; but they had their Efficacy upon theſe grounds: 1. The Divine Inſtitution to that End: 2. The mingling of the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy of the Sacrifice and Satisfaction of Chriſt with 3. A performance of them with an Obediential and believing Heart, which, though it was not always accompanied with an explicite and actual belief of Chriſt, yet it was not without thus much Faith; <hi>viz.</hi> That it was a thing injoined by God for ſome ſpecial Purpoſe, for the good of his Creature. And thus likewiſe in Infants, who are not capable of an actual exerciſe of Faith, God hath queſtionleſs, ſome
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:50435:151"/>
ſecret efficacious means of the application of Chriſt's Sacrifice unto them. Thus, proportionable to the Condition of his Elect in all times and Conditions, God is pleaſed to proportion a means to make this Sacrifice effectual. To the ancient Fathers, that had not the ſame opportunity of believing, in reſpect Chriſt was not revealed to them ſo clearly as to us, it was his Will to appoint at leaſt, a more implicite and obſcure act of Faith: They were ſhut up unto the Faith that ſhould afterwards be revealed, <hi>Galat.</hi> 3.23.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Becauſe Faith is <hi>the firſt act of the New Life,</hi> wrought in the Heart by the Spirit of God, tending to Union: It is true, that Knowledge is that which precedes all the works of Grace in the Soul; but in this, the Soul is not ſo much active, as paſſive; and Knowledge doth not of it ſelf, unite the Soul to the Object, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt, as it doth unite the Object to the Soul: But the firſt motion of the Soul to Union, is not that Faith of Aſſent, which differs not from Knowledge, but the Faith of Recumbency or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence. And this <hi>priority of the act of Faith</hi> is not in time, for Life is wrought all at once in the Soul; but in Nature and actual operation. And this priority of Faith in this ſenſe is <hi>upon three grounds:</hi> 1. In reſpect of the nature of the Act. 2. In reſpect of the nature of that Truth, upon which it fixeth. 3. In reſpect of the Condition of the Creature.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. In reſpect of <hi>the nature of the Act;</hi> The Creature is created eſſentially depending upon God; and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance is the firſt relative act of the Creature unto the Creator; as it is the firſt relation, ſo the firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a rational Creature unto God, is by an act of Dependance and Recumbence upon his Truth and Goodneſs. And herein conſiſted as the firſt act of Union, in our uncorrupted Nature, unto God, ſo herein was the firſt breach that was made upon Man,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:50435:151"/>
                           <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Yea, hath God ſaid,</hi> &amp;c. Man's Duty was Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbency, and Truſt, and Reliance upon the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Creator, and the Devil weakens his Faith or Dependance upon his God, and deceives him. His firſt Fall was Diſtruſt in the Word and Goodneſs of God, and his firſt Recovery muſt be by Recumbency upon him, his Truth, and Goodneſs.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. In reſpect of <hi>the nature of the Meſſage.</hi> It is a Meſſage, that as it requires, ſo it concerns our Faith and Recumbency. It is a Promiſe of Mercy and Peace unto as many as believe the Meſſage: According to the nature of the thing known, is the motion of the Heart towards it: This is a Meſſage of Deliverance and Peace, with a Command to reſt upon it; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of neceſſity, the firſt act muſt be Recumbence, <hi>John</hi> 11.40. <hi>Said I not, if thou wouldeſt believe, thou ſhould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſee the Glory of God,</hi> Exod. 14.13. <hi>Fear not, ſtand ſtill, and ſee the ſalvation of the Lord.</hi> The firſt act, that a Meſſage of Deliverance from God worketh upon the Heart, that entertains it, is Recumbency and Reſting upon the Truth and Power of God.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. In reſpect of <hi>the Condition that this</hi> Meſſage of Deliverance <hi>finds us in.</hi> We are incompaſſed every where with Guilt; and the avenger of blood purſues that guilt; and we cannot by any means find any Power in our ſelves, or in any other Creature, to eſcape it: The Soul being ſeriouſly convinced of this, God preſents unto it the Satisfaction and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt, his Promiſe of Acceptation of it, and our deliverance from his wrath by it: And now the Soul, like a Man ready to be drowned, firſt lays hold of the Cable that is thrown out to him, even before it hath leiſure to contemplate the Goodneſs of him, that did it. So the condition of our Miſery teacheth us firſt to claſp the Promiſe of Mercy and Salvation in Chriſt; and then to conſider and contemplate the great
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:50435:152"/>
Mercy and Goodneſs of God, and to entertain it with Love and Thankfulneſs. An extream Exigence will give a Man ſome confidence to adventure upon a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult and unlikely occaſion of deliverance; becauſe it is poſſible his Condition may be bettered, it cannot be made worſe, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.4. <hi>Why ſit we here until we die? if we enter into the City, the Famine is in the City, and we ſhall die there; if we ſit ſtill here, we die alſo: Now therefore let us f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>NOW we come to conſider the <hi>Effects of this our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with Chriſt</hi> more diſtinctly.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Remiſſion of Sins,</hi> Epheſ 1.7. Coloſ. 1.14. <hi>In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveneſs of ſins:</hi> For by virtue of our Union with him, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther looks upon us, as having made that Satisfaction for Sin, which in truth his Son made.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Juſtification:</hi> For as by virtue of our Union with him, his Satisfaction is ours, ſo is his Righteouſneſs. And hence that Righteouſneſs, by which we are made righteous in the ſight of God, is called the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. <hi>That we might be made the Righteouſneſs of God in him,</hi> Phil. 3.9. <hi>That I may be found in him, not having mine own righteouſneſs, which is of the Law, but that which is through the Faith of Chriſt, the Righteouſneſs which is of God by Faith:</hi> And therefore <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.6.33.16. he is called, <hi>The Lord our Righteouſneſs.</hi> And indeed without this, though it were poſſible, that we could have our ſins forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, yet without this Righteouſneſs, we could not actually attain Happineſs. Chriſt therefore muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent us Holy, as well as unblameable, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.22. So then, being one with him, as our ſins by imputation
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:50435:153"/>
were his, and his Satisfaction ours, ſo was alſo his Righteouſneſs.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>Peace and Reconciliation with God:</hi> For as God from Heaven, proclaimed himſelf well pleaſed in his Son, ſo if we are one with him, he is conſequently well pleaſed with us. And this Concluſion follows naturally from our Juſtification in the ſight of God: The controverſie between God and his Creature was Sin; and when Chriſt took up that Controverſie, there muſt needs follow peace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Being juſtified by Faith we have Peace with God through Chriſt,</hi> Coloſ. 1.20. <hi>Having made Peace through the blood of his Croſs,</hi> Eph. 2.14. <hi>For he is our Peace:</hi> And the conſequent of this Peace with God, is Peace with the Creature, who, when Man became Rebel to God, became Rebel to Man, unuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, vain, full of vexation: but by our Peace reſtored with our God, our Peace with the Creature, is part of our Portion, Godlineſs having the Promiſe of this Life, as well as that to come, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Matt.</hi> 6.33. and peace with our own Conſciences: Conſcience was God's Vicegerent in Man, and when her Lord is angry, the Conſcience will chide: It is a Glaſs, wherein a Man may by reflection, ſee the face of Heaven, and of his own Soul. But when once the Heart is ſprinkled from an evil Conſcience by the Blood of Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.2.22. the Conſcience is quiet, for Heaven is quiet. As Peace was the Proclamation of an Angel at the Birth of Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.14. ſo Peace was the Legacy of Chriſt, when he was leaving the World, <hi>John</hi> 14.27. <hi>My Peace I leave with you.</hi> And the Fruit of this Peace, muſt needs be Joy: When a Man upon ſound grounds doth find that his Peace is made with Heaven, there cannot chuſe but be a Joy anſwerable to the ſenſe of ſo beneficial a Peace. Therefore <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17. The Kingdom of God is <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Rom. 15.13. <hi>The God of Hope fill you with all Joy and Peace in believing.</hi>
                           <pb n="270" facs="tcp:50435:154"/>
Where there is Faith there will be Peace; and where Peace, Joy: and therefore when Chriſt had finiſhed the work of our Redemption, that Spirit which he ſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World, is called the Comforter, <hi>John</hi> 15.26.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. <hi>The Spirit of Chriſt:</hi> and that may be taken theſe ways.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The immediate <hi>Communication of the Holy Spirit,</hi> wherewith Chriſt himſelf was indued: for, as in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Union of the Divine Nature, there was an Eſſential Union between the Son and the Spirit; ſo by that Union of both Natures in one Perſon, there was a Communion of the ſame Spirit unto Chriſt; The Spirit deſcended upon him like a Dove, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.16. God gave him not the Spirit by meaſure, <hi>John</hi> 3.34. Now as <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Ointment, that was poured firſt upon his Head, deſcended upon the Hem of his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; ſo by virtue of our Union with him, that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that was without meaſure poured upon our Head, was in ſome meaſure, diffuſed upon all that are united to him: and as the ſame Soul, that actuates the Heart and the Head in a more plentiful and eminent manner, doth inactuate the moſt inconſiderable part of the ſame Body; ſo the ſame Spirit, that is in Chriſt, is in every one that is united unto him, though in a different degree of operation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9. <hi>If any man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his,</hi> 2 Cor. 6.17. <hi>He that is joyned unto the Lord, is one Spirit.</hi> And by this Spirit of Chriſt, which he giveth and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cateth unto thoſe that are united unto him, they are ſaid to be ſealed by the Spirit of Promiſe, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.13. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.22. <hi>viz.</hi> It is by this Spirit of Chriſt, that we have acceſs unto God, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.18. <hi>We have acceſs by one Spirit unto the Father:</hi> and it is this Spirit that forms our Deſires in us; and by this means, our Deſires are not only diſcovered unto God, that knows the mind of his own Spirit, but they are alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:50435:154"/>
unto the Will of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.27. <hi>He that ſearcheth the heart, knoweth what is in the mind of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, becauſe be maketh interceſſion for the Saints, according to the will of God.</hi> And as the Father did hear the Son always, becauſe his Deſires were conformable to the Will of his Father, <hi>John</hi> 11.42. <hi>I know that thou heareſt me always:</hi> ſo, <hi>John</hi> 16.23. <hi>Whatſoever ye ſhall ask the Father in my name, he ſhall give it you:</hi> for it is a Petition framed by that Spirit, which is the Spirit of Chriſt, and of God; and what his own Spirit deſires, it is his own Will to grant: And for this cauſe, it is called the Spirit of Adoption; <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. God is pleaſed to accept the Prayers and Services of the Members of Chriſt in him, even as the obedience of his own Sons, becauſe they are moved and actuated by the very ſame Spirit, which is the Spirit of his Son. And as the intrinſecal form of things is that which inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally conforms the qualities and proportions of the thing which it informs unto that intrinſecal form, and ſuits it with Qualities and Conditions ſuitable to its Operations; ſo this Spirit of Chriſt doth by degrees conform the Soul, the Affections, the whole Man, unto the Image of Chriſt, changing it into the ſame Image, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. And this Spirit of Chriſt doth lead them into all Truth, <hi>John</hi> 16.13. And from hence it is, that he that is the true Member of Chriſt, cannot continue in a conſtant courſe of ſin, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.9. <hi>For his ſeed remaineth in him,</hi> viz. That Spirit of Chriſt, by which he is actuated, and by which he is born of God, <hi>John</hi> 3.6. <hi>That which is born of the Spirit, is Spirit.</hi> That abideth in him, and will be degrees, like a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Spring, work out that mudd, that our own fleſh and corruption caſt into us.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Which is a fruit of the former, The mind of Chriſt. For this Spirit of God works a <hi>Conformity</hi> in the Heart and Life to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whoſe Spirit it is: This
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:50435:155"/>
Spirit of Chriſt makes an impreſſion of the Image of Chriſt upon the Soul and Life. The like Effect with this, we find in all things: In matters Natural, the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinity of two things together, works a Conformity of the weaker to the ſtronger, either Element or Form: In matters Moral, Converſation between two, breed a Conformity in Manners, even different from their otherwiſe natural Conſtitution: much more, where the Spirit of Chriſt lays hold on the Soul, and unites a Man unto Chriſt, there is not only new Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, but a new Form, and conſequently of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity a new frame and temper of Heart and Life, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to ſuch Company, and to ſuch a Form. And in order to this Conformity unto Chriſt, the Old Converſation, the Old Man, which is corrupt, according to the deceitful Luſts, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.22. muſt be put off; the Affections and Luſts muſt be crucified, <hi>Galat.</hi> 5.25. the Body will be dead becauſe of ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.10. Ungodlineſs and Worldly Luſts will be denied, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.12. For theſe make a deformity from Chriſt; ſuch a Spirit, as the Spirit of Chriſt, cannot long endure to inform or inhabit ſuch a Soul, but if it come into him, it will change him: And in ſtead thereof, the Man ſhall be born again by the Spirit, <hi>John</hi> 3.5. the Spirit will be Life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.10. Chriſt will be new formed in them, <hi>Galat.</hi> 4.19. the walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will be in the Spirit, <hi>Galat.</hi> 5.25. the New Man will be put on, even the Image of Chriſt, Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and true Holineſs, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.24. Chriſt will be put on, <hi>Galat.</hi> 3.27. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.14. the Life will be the Life of Chriſt, <hi>Galat.</hi> 2.20. the Heart will be the Habitation of Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.17. of God, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.22. of the Holy Ghoſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.19. the mind, the mind of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.16. the temper of the Soul, the ſame with his, humble as he was humble, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.5. holy, as he is holy, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.16. long-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:50435:155"/>
and indulgent as he was, <hi>John</hi> 13.15. <hi>Behold, have I not given you an example.</hi> Patient under the Will of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And by Conformity unto Chriſt, Man is put into a right ſtate, and in that order to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God himſelf and others, as he was in his creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and thereby in ſome meaſure reſtored to that Happineſs which he had by reaſon of that order: The Happineſs and Peace of every thing conſiſting in the due obſervance of that ſtation and Rule, which God hath given it. And this Conformity unto Chriſt, is our <hi>Sanctification,</hi> which is nothing elſe, but a reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Man in ſome meaſure to that Conformity un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Will of God, in which he was created. Man by ſin, loſt that impreſſion of God's Image: God was pleaſed to give us his Son, who is the expreſs Image of his Father, and by this Spirit of his to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imprint that Image again upon as many as behold him, and come unto him by Faith, 1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.3. <hi>This is the will of God, even your Sanctification:</hi> ſo that the Sanctification or Obedience, which is wrought in us, and required of us, is the Conformity of the Will of Man to the Will of God. The <hi>Obedience</hi> perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto God by the Faithful, ariſeth from <hi>a double Principle.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. This whereof we now ſpeak, an <hi>intrinſecal Change of the Nature</hi> Conforming the Heart, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the Life, to the Will of God, the Mind of Chriſt: for the ſame Spirit of Chriſt, which dwells in Chriſt our Head, dwells likewiſe in thoſe that are the Members of the ſame Body: and as the oneneſs of the Soul in Man, makes that oneneſs of motion in all the Body, and that Conformity, that is in all its motions, to the mind of the Soul; ſo that oneneſs of the Spirit in Chriſt and his Members, makes that Conformity of the Members of Chriſt unto the Mind and Will of Chriſt, which is the uncreated
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:50435:156"/>
Image of God: This is <hi>Regeneration;</hi> the birth of the Spirit; the forming of Chriſt in us, the Sanctification of the Spirit, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That whereof before is ſpoken, <hi>Love unto God;</hi> which is always the Soul of all true Obedience. The Soul finds the Goodneſs, and Rectitude and Beauty of God, and of all his Commands, and therefore out of a Judicial Love, it is ſenſible of the ingagement that it ows to God; and therefore out of Gratitude, it will, as far as the ſtrength of the Soul can reach, obey the Commands, which are ſo Righteous, of her God, that is ſo Gracious: It finds, that it was the Purpoſe of God; he created us unto good Works, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.10. that as many as are in Chriſt, ought to walk as he walked, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.5. That the Son of God died to deſtroy the works of the Devil, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.8. to purifie unto himſelf a People zealous of Good Works, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14. That Chriſt hath ordained, that his Diſciples ſhould bring forth Fruit, <hi>John</hi> 15.16. That for this cauſe Chriſt died, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that from thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth, they that live, ſhould not live unto themſelves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.15. Now the true Love of God, makes the Will of God, to be his Will, and the Glory of God his End: if there were no Beauty in the thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, yet ſhall I diſpute his Will, that hath redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me? ſhall I go about to diſappoint him in the End of his Death for me? ordinary Reaſon teacheth me to ſubſcribe and yield Obedience to the Commands of God, for they are all moſt Wiſe and moſt Juſt Commands; and though I ſee not the Wiſdom, Uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and Juſtice of them, yet the ſame Truth, that tells me, his ways are unſearchable and paſt finding out, teacheth me to obey, when I diſcern the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, though not the Reaſon of the Command. But if it were not ſo, ſuppoſe I could be a loſer by my Obedience, I cannot loſe ſo much as I have
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:50435:156"/>
freely received from him that commands me: When <hi>Abraham</hi> received a Son from the Goodneſs of God, and God required him again, <hi>Abraham</hi> obeys, though his Obedience had left him as Childleſs as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe found him: But the greateſt Command, that I can receive from my Saviour, cannot return me to ſo bad a Condition, as his Pity and Mercy found me in: If he require my Riches, my Liberty, my Life yet he leaves me ſomewhat, which without his Goodneſs, I had loſt, and doth more than countervail all my other Loſſes, even my Everlaſting Soul: When he requires theſe of me, he pays me intereſt for them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.29. But if he did not, yet the Price of my Soul in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Gratitude, may deſerve the life of my Body; for what can a Man give in Exchange for his Soul? <hi>Matth.</hi> 16 26.</p>

                        <p>For the former, it is nothing but that Ataxy, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, and Corruption, which by ſin did fall upon our Nature: It is not our Nature in its eſſentials, for that is ſtill good; but the abſence of the Goodneſs and Perfection of the reaſonable Soul, which conſiſted in the Conformity to the Will of God, which is the Beauty and Perfection of every thing.

And yet the Old Man hath maſtered and corrupted this alſo, puts it awry, or out, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.19. defiles the Mind and Conſcience, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15. ſears the Conſcience, ſo that it is inſenſible, and paſt feeling, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.19. And if the Conſcience be ſo vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, as not to be ſtifled by means of this Corruption and the concurrence of the Prince of the Air, it becomes our Miſleader, being filled with Errors and miſtakings; or our Tormentor, being filled with horror and deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: and it is the great work of God in our renova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to reſtore the Conſcience to his primitive office and place, by taking away the guilt of ſin, which kept the Conſcience in a continual ſtorm, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.2.22. and by purging the Conſcience from the pollutions and corruptions of ſin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. purging the Conſcience from dead works, to ſerve the living God.</p>
                        <p n="3">(3) <hi>In the Will</hi> there is irregularity upon a double ground:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. By reaſon of that Corruption that is in the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding: for the proſecution or averſation of the Will are much qualified and ruled according to the Light that is in the Underſtanding; and if that Light be Darkneſs and Error, then there muſt neceſſarily follow a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage in the Will.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. By reaſon of that Captivity, that is in the Will unto the Law of Sin, and of the Fleſh. God gave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Man a righteous Law, which was to be the Law and Rule of his Mind and Will; and while it was conformable to this, it was conformable to the Will of God, and ſo beautiful and regular: But in ſtead thereof, there is a Law of Sin and Death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.21. and this Law ſubdues the Law of the Mind, and brings the Soul into captivity to the Law of Sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.23. And the Will being thus captiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, is made carnal, and filled with enmity againſt God, and that Law, which he once planted in us to be the
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:50435:158"/>
Rule of our Will, ſo that it is not ſubject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. nay, the Will is ſo much maſtered and poſſeſſed by this Old Man and his Law, that when it meets with the Law of God coming into the Soul, it takes occaſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to work in the Soul all manner of Concupiſcence, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.6. out of malice and policy to make that Law, which comes to reſcue the Soul, more odious to the Soul, and the Soul to it: as Conquerours uſe to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce Laws, Cuſtoms, and Languages of their own, the more to eſtrange the conquered from any memory of their former duty or freedoms: And when Chriſt comes into the Soul, he reſcues the Will from this Captivity, and from the Dominion of Sin, though not from the Inherence and Reſidence of it; and doth by degrees waſte and diminiſh that very inherence of ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. <hi>Sin ſhall not have Dominion over you; for you are not under the Law, but under Grace;</hi> and plants and ſupports another Law in us, even the Law of the Spirit of Life in Chriſt, which maketh us free from the Law of Sin and of Death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.2.</p>
                        <p n="4">(4.) <hi>In the Affections.</hi> The great and maſter Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of our Soul, is <hi>our Love:</hi> and all other Affections are derived from it, and in order to it. Our Hatred of any thing, is becauſe it is contrary and deſtructive to what we love: our Fear of any thing, is becauſe it would rob us of what we love: our Grief for any thing, is becauſe it hath deprived us of what we love. And according to the meaſure of our Love, is the meaſure of our other Affections: an intenſe Love unto any thing, makes our Hatred of its contrary equally intenſe; and ſo for the other Affections. In our ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Creation our Love was rightly placed, upon God, the only deſerver of our Love: and our Love was rightly qualified; it was a moſt intenſe Love: The Law and Command of God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.5. <hi>Thou ſhalt
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:50435:159"/>
love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy Soul, and with all thy might;</hi> was but the Copy of that Law, that was written in our Nature. And our Love thus rightly placed, and rightly qualified, did tutor all the reſt of our Paſſions and Affections both in their objects and degrees: It taught us to hate Sin, and that with a perfect hatred, becauſe contrary to the Mind of that God, whom we did perfectly love; and it taught us to hate nothing elſe but Sin, becauſe nothing but that had a contrariety unto God. But when we fell, our Love loſt its object, and all the Affections thereby became miſplaced, and diſordered: And though we loſt the object of this Affection, yet we loſt not the Affection it ſelf; our Love therefore, having loſt his guide, wanders after ſomething elſe, and takes up our ſelves, and makes that the object of our Love. But as our Love is miſplaced in reſpect of its object; ſo it miſtakes in its purſuit of that object: no Man can truly love himſelf, that doth not truly love God; becauſe the true effect of Love, is to do all the Good it can to the thing it loves. Now the chiefeſt Good to our ſelves is only our Conformity unto God's Will, and conſequently our Love to him, wherein conſiſts our Happineſs: But it is no marvel that having forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the true object of our Love, and choſen our ſelves to be that object, we are likewiſe miſtaken in the ſeeking of our own Good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.26. <hi>Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worſhipped and ſerved the Creature more than the Creator: For this cauſe God gave them up to vile affections.</hi> Now every man, that terminates his Love upon himſelf, ſerves and worſhips himſelf. And now that order, which God planted being broken, it is no wonder, that all confuſion and diſorder falls among our Affections: And now our Love being miſplaced, all the reſt of our Affections are likewiſe miſplaced and out of order: Now the right frame of our Love,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:50435:159"/>
and conſequently the corruption of it, conſiſts in three things:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. In the ultimate Object of our Love: it ought to be ſettled upon God, and upon him only.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. In the Order of our Love: it ought to be ſet upon God, and upon him firſt: and all other things may be loved, but yet in him and after him.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. In the Degree of our Love: our chiefeſt and moſt intenſe Love muſt be ſet upon God, and upon him only. And theſe are moſt rational and natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions, as appears before.</p>
                        <p>Now the Old Man in our Affections, conſiſts in the abſence and deprivation of this Order that God hath ſet.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The deprivation of the firſt, when either we love not God at all, or, which is all one, when we make him not the Ultimate Object of our Love, but love him meerly in reference to our ſelves: the conſequence whereof is, that if God be not in all things ſubſervient to thoſe things, we conceive moſt conducible to our own good, we diſobey him, we murmure againſt him, we blaſpheme him, we hate him: If the baſeſt Luſt, Pleaſure, Content, come in competition with his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, it ſhall conquer it, becauſe we have made our ſelves our Ultimate and Chief End, and therefore ſhall certainly prefer any thing that we think moſt condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible to this End.</p>
                        <p>And certainly, he that makes himſelf his Ultimate End, and the chief object of his Love, cannot chuſe but fail in the two latter: for his love to himſelf, makes him love all things elſe in order meerly to himſelf, and ſo far forth only as is conducible to his own miſtaken good; ſo that God ſhall be no longer loved, ſerved, or obeyed, than he is ſubſervient to that End. Now it is eaſie from this Conſideration, to ſee <hi>the Original of moſt of the Evil in the World:</hi> whether it relates to God, to Men, or to a Man's ſelf.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="282" facs="tcp:50435:160"/>From this Original grows the very <hi>Hatred of God.</hi> This diſtemper, wrought by ſin in our Souls, hath not only deprived God of our chiefeſt Love, which we juſtly owe to him, and turned that Love into our ſelves, but hath made us haters of God by our corrupred Nature, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.30. <hi>He ſtrengtheneth himſelf againſt the Almighty,</hi> Job 25.25. <hi>that ſay unto God, Depart from us,</hi> Job 22.17. For having made himſelf his End, he cannot chuſe but be a hater of God upon a double ground:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Becauſe the Preſence, and Purity, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and Admonitions of God, either by his Word, or Conſcience, or the outward Diſpenſations of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence do extreamly thwart that End which we pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue. Hence grow the <hi>Blaſphemies</hi> in the World, <hi>Revel.</hi> 16.21. <hi>Men blaſphemed God becauſe of the hail.</hi> The Diſappointment, and Controll, and Interruption, that Men have in the purſuit of their Ends, do make them hate the Preſence, the Word, the very Being of God himſelf, becauſe they take it to be a hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of their End, and their Happineſs.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The Soul, that was once united to God, is by ſin gone a whoring from him, and hath taken up ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther End; yet God in Mercy ſtill perſwades the Soul to return. <hi>Turn, O back-ſliding Children, ſaith the Lord, for I am married unto you,</hi> Jer. 3. The skill of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of God within us is, as much as may be, to divert the acceſs of ſuch perſwaſions to the Soul, or the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment of them, leſt thereby he ſhould be diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd; and therefore, as <hi>Ahitophel</hi> to <hi>Abſolom,</hi> to ſecure his Party with impoſſibility of reconciliation to his Father, perſwades him to the higheſt Villany, that ſo he might be abhorred of his Father, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.21. ſo the Devil and Sin in us ingage the Soul in the greateſt Villanies and Blaſphemies againſt God, that ſo the Soul, abhorring God, may be abhorred of him. Thus
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:50435:160"/>
Sin taking occaſion by the Command, works in the Soul all manner of Concupiſcence, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.6.</p>
                        <p>From hence likewiſe proceeds the <hi>Slaviſh Fear</hi> of God. We have ſhewen before that all Love of God, is accompanied with the Fear of God; but this Fear is without the Love of God, but proceeds from Love to our ſelves; as a Man fears that, which he doubts will be deſtructive to that, which he makes his End. When God ſent Lions among the captive <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> it is ſaid, they feared the Lord, and ſerved their own gods, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.33. their fear and their Love was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided.</p>
                        <p>From hence proceeds <hi>Atheiſm</hi> it ſelf: for it begins in the Affection, not in the Underſtanding. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of that not to be, which the corrupted Soul con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives an impediment or check to the proſecution of his ſupream End, is that which at length breeds a half perſwaſion in the Underſtanding that that, which he deſires ſhould not be, indeed is not.</p>
                        <p>From hence proceed <hi>Idolatries</hi> and miſapprehenſions of God. When we will not frame our ſelves to God, we endeavour to frame him to our ſelves: <hi>thou thoughteſt I was ſuch an one at thou art.</hi> And from this cauſe are all thoſe will-worſhips, contrary to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God. Did our chiefeſt Love ſettle upon God, our Obedience would be Univerſal; but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in this matter of his worſhip: but when we make our ſelves our Ends, we meaſure him out ſuch a Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, as may beſt pleaſe our ſelves, and ſuit with our own Contentment.</p>
                        <p>From hence proceeds <hi>Hypocriſie,</hi> a Form of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs without the power thereof, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5. The Power of Godlineſs, which is nothing elſe, but the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire and intenſe Love of God, cannot conſiſt with that End a Man hath choſen, <hi>viz.</hi> himſelf; yet the ſhape and form of it, according as the occaſion is, is condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:50435:161"/>
to his Eaſe, Greatneſs, or Preferment: ſo the ſame ſelf-love puts on the ſhadow, and rejects the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
                        <p>In matters relative <hi>to others:</hi> From this making a Man's ſelf his End, proceed all the acts and habits of Injuſtice, Oppreſſion, Cruelty, Malice, Envy, that is in the World; becauſe he that makes himſelf his End, doth with all vigor purſue that, which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives good for himſelf; and if he meet with any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle, or fear of an obſtacle from another, it engageth <hi>per fas &amp; nefas</hi> the ruine of that which he finds ſo hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring him: for all theſe Acts proceed from the Love of himſelf.</p>
                        <p>In reference <hi>to a Man's ſelf:</hi> He that makes himſelf his own End, is ſubſervient unto himſelf to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, in the purſuit and enjoyment of all thoſe things, which may pleaſe and content himſelf, according to the varieties of Conſtitutions, Ages and Circumſtances.</p>
                        <p>If it be in the Luſts of the Fleſh, it will teach him to make proviſion for the fleſh, to fulfil the luſts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.14. It will put him upon ſtudies, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries, and purſuits of unnatural impurities, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.26. it will make him give himſelf over to laſciviouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to work all uncleanneſs with greedineſs, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.19. becauſe what a Man makes his chiefeſt End, he ſtrives by all means to pleaſe, in whatſoever way it diſcovers its delight or acceptation.</p>
                        <p>If it be in Luxury, and delights in Meat and Drink, it will make a Man to ſerve his Belly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.18. It will make a Man's Belly his God, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.19. A Man making himſelf his End, obſerves which way the vein of his mind and delight runs; he doth ſerve that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection or delight with the ſame intenſeneſs of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit, as if it were his God; for what a Man makes his End, he makes his God.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="285" facs="tcp:50435:161"/>If it be in the Luſt of the Eyes, after Wealth or Poſſeſſions, a Man purſues that with the ſame violence as a Heart well ſet, purſues after God: There ſhall no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſtand in his way, neither the Command of God, nor Lives, nor Laws, nor Juſtice, nor Reputation, nor a Man's own quiet, eaſe, health, life: For Self hath diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered her ſelf in this deſire, and he doth purſue the ſatisfaction of it as the firſt-born of his End. The like for the Pride of Life, Ambition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And from hence grows the Pride of the Heart of Man. Every Man that makes not God his Chiefeſt Good, and higheſt End, makes himſelf ſo. But this Self diſcovers it ſelf, according to varieties of Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions and Circumſtances. Self in one Man is his Luſt; in another his Wealth; in another his Honour, Power, and Command; in another, Wit, Learning, Policy: And theſe he purſues as the firſt-born of his End: And ſuch as is his earneſtneſs in the purſuit, ſuch is his ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and contentedneſs when he enjoys, or thinks he enjoys it: and that, eſpecially in thoſe purſuits that are leſs bruitiſh, makes the Man ſo high and ſo proud, becauſe he is full of that, which he makes his End; he is full of himſelf.</p>
                        <p>In <hi>the Senſual Appetite:</hi> This Motion or Faculty was planted in Nature by the God of Nature, and is of it ſelf good, when it keeps within thoſe bounds, and in that ſubordination, in which it was originally placed by the God of Nature and Order; For it is the natural inclination and motion of Nature to its own preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and perpetuity: But our contracted Corruption hath put this out of its Place, and out of its Order, and out of its End. The rational part of Man being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come weak and out of frame, this that was placed in ſubordination to it, hath got the maſtery of it, and ſo carries Man to all exceſs of Riot and Luxury. The ſtrength of the motion of the Senſual Appetite to its
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:50435:162"/>
Objects, and that Delight, that by the Goodneſs and Wiſdom of God was planted in the fruition of its Object, was not for its own ſake, or the end of this motion; but a wiſe diſpenſation of God to carry the humane Nature to its own preſervation: But Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in Man, hath made that very Delight to be the end of its motion; and therefore purſues that, though it be to the ruine and diſtemper of his Nature. The very Beaſts, that have not reaſon to rule them, do inſtruct us in this very decay of our integrity: For although they have no higher Guide, than that Law and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, which God implanted in their Nature; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they have the ſame Delight in the fruition of their ſenſitive Objects, as Man hath; yet they ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or never purſue their Appetites beyond the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of the preſervation of themſelves and their Species: But it is viſibly otherwiſe with Men: and from hence is that exceſs in eating, drinking, ſleep and other ſenſitive inclinations; becauſe they purſue not that End, for which it was given, but the very pleaſing and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of the Appetite it ſelf: So then the Old Man in the Senſual Appetite conſiſts,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. In the want of that Subjection and Subordination of it to the reaſonable part, which ſhould direct, mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and reſtrain it, according as may be moſt uſeful for that better part of Man; ſo that now this power is out of its place.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. In that Exorbitancy and Extravagancy of it, whereby it runs to Exceſs; and ſo it hath loſt its End, <hi>viz.</hi> the motion to the preſervation of Nature. It is true, God hath given to the Sons of Men, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of theſe ſenſual things, Objects, not only of neceſſity, but delight; But here is our miſery, as well as our ſin; That either we reſt not in what God lawfully allows, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.8. God gives to <hi>David</hi> a full meaſure of temporal Comforts and Delights,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:50435:162"/>
and if that had been too little; he would have given him more; yet <hi>David</hi> with <hi>Adam</hi> muſt needs be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting the forbidden Fruit: or in caſe we go no farther in the Object of our purſuit, we go beyond it in the meaſure of our purſuits, reſting in the enjoyments of them, as of our chiefeſt Felicity, forgetting the God that gives them, and thoſe inquiries and purſuits that are of a higher Value and Concernment; and, which is the higheſt degree of vileneſs of our Hearts, even by thoſe outward Bleſſings he gives us, we learn to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit his enemy into our Hearts, to ſhut him out of it, and to fortifie it againſt him. And from hence it is, that the God of Mercy curſeth, and that moſt juſtly, his own Bleſſings unto that Man, that thus perverts the uſe of them. Wine rejoyceth the Heart of Man, as it was given for that purpoſe; But when a Man in the uſe of it looks no higher, but to ſatiate himſelf, there is a ſting put into it, and it proves a Serpent, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.32.</p>

                        <p>THUS far concerning the Old Man, the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of our Nature: Now we conſider, <hi>How he is to be put off.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This <hi>putting off the Old Man</hi> looks backward, and that is Repentance; forward, and that is Mortification.</p>
                        <p>The order of God's diſpenſation to a particular Man, in bringing him to his great and ſupream End, holds a proportion with his diſpenſation to mankind ſince the Fall: from the time of the Fall of Man till the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Law, is like the firſt Condition of our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Nature, without God in the World: Then he gave them his Law, thereby to ſhew them what they ſhould be, and what they are; for the Rule is not only the diſcovery of it ſelf, but of that crookedneſs and irregularity which is in the deviation from it. Man having now the opportunity of diſcovery of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and conſequently unhappineſs, of his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, he ſends the Baptiſt to call him to repentance, and then diſcovers unto him the means of his recovery. Thus after our wandring in our corruptions, God is pleaſed to ſhew us our Condition, what it is, and what it ſhould be, by the ſight of his Law; and that doth naturally breed a diſlike of thoſe ways, which lead to ſo unhappy an End. The <hi>grounds</hi> and way <hi>of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> are,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. A ſound <hi>Conviction of</hi> the Underſtanding concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>our natural ways and Conditions.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">
                           <pb n="289" facs="tcp:50435:163"/>1. That they are <hi>Irregular, Deformed, and Crooked</hi> ways: God gave to Man a Righteous Law, and the Conformity to it was Man's Happineſs and Perfection; for the Goodneſs, which was the Perfection of all created Beings, conſiſted in their Conformity to the particular Will of God concerning the Creature. That Will concerning Man was the Law of God. This Law God hath again new copied out, that Man may as well meaſure himſelf by it, what he is, and hath been, as guide himſelf to what he ſhould be.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The conſequence of this therefore is, that thoſe ways of his are <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nprofitable and Fruitleſs;</hi> and therefore are they called the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfruitful works of Darkneſs:</hi> and not only Unfruitful but <hi>Deadly; What fruit had ye then in thoſe things whereof ye are now aſhamed? for the end of thoſe things is Death.</hi> And this muſt moſt neceſſarily follow upon the former; for if the Conformity to the Will of God be the Perfection and Bleſſedneſs of the Creature, the Violation of that Will muſt needs be both unprofitable and miſerable: for Man is out of his way to his Perfection, and therefore muſt neceſſarily meet with nothing but Vanity and Miſery. God, that hath meaſured out to every thing his Being, and the meaſure of his Perfection, hath likewiſe chalked out the way of attaining it, which, if a Man miſs, he can never attain that End.</p>
                        <p>And upon this Conviction of the Irregularity, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitableneſs, and Dangerouſneſs of his corrupted ways and condition, doth naturally follow ſuch thoughts as theſe:
<q>I find God did make me a glorious Creature, fitted to partake of a higher degree of Bleſſedneſs, than the inferiour Creatures: I find likewiſe that he gave me a moſt Juſt and Reaſonable Law, which was the way to lead unto it: I ſee that ſo much of the Creatures inferiour to my ſelf, as ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Law of their Creation, enjoy a meaſure of

Perfection, anſwerable to their Being; and if inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted in that law of their Nature, they loſe their Beauty, if not their Being: The degree of my Being was higher than theirs, and ſo was conſequently the End of my Being, my Happineſs, of a higher Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution than theirs: And as my Debt was greater to my Creator for allowing me ſo high an End, ſo was my ability proportionable to the purſuit and attaining of that End which was thus given to me. But what have I been doing all this while? I have meaſured my Heart by that great Law, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord with all thy heart;</hi> and I have found my Heart full of the love of the World, of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, of Vanities, but ſcarce a thought beſtowed on him, that gave me Power to think; and, which is worſe, my Heart hath held confederacy with all that he hath forbidden, inſomuch that I may juſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that ſurely nothing but a Heart hating God, could ſo conſtantly and univerſally oppoſe his Will: I have meaſured my Life by the Law of God, and I can ſcarcely find one regular action in it; my Heart hath not been ſo out of frame, but it hath ſtill found a full ſubſervience of my whole Man unto it, and that with greedineſs: and yet I find all this unſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory, and I have cauſe to fear, that is not all: Senſe doth tell me, that in the purſuit of the ways of my Heart, I ſpend my ſelf for that which is not Bread, and my labour for that which profiteth not: I find no fulneſs in them, but much vexation: And Reaſon as well as Conſcience tells me, it will be bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs in the end, and the end is death: I cannot but know, that the great Lord of all Being, hath meaſured out to all his Creatures their Beings, and their Happineſs ſuitable to their Beings, and their Ways and Rules, and Laws, to attain their Happineſs; and if all this while I have been out of that Way, I
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:50435:164"/>
am travelling to another End: If in the way of God I ſhould have found Life, and everlaſting Life for my End, out of that Way, my End muſt be Death: If I were now to begin my Life, I ſhould order it better: Though I cannot expiate what is paſt, yet my Soul looks upon it with <hi>Sorrow,</hi> with Indignation, with Amazement. This is the firſt degree.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. That they are <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbecoming, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngrateful and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nduti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Returns.</hi> It is implanted even in the ſenſitive Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to return good for good: We have received all the Good from the hands of that God, againſt whom the practice of our Hearts and Lives hath been a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Rebellion: and upon this Conſideration natural Ingenuity works a <hi>Shame</hi> in the Soul, and a ſecret Condemnation, and ſome kind of loathing ſo Ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and Undutiful a Conſtitution.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. But hitherto the Soul looks only backward; and theſe Conſiderations, though they are enough to breed Shame and Deſpair in the Soul, yet they are not ſtrong enough to work Repentance; becauſe in thoſe Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, the Soul looks upon it ſelf in an unexpiable and irrecoverable Condition: The amendment will prove fruitleſs, where the former guilt is irreverſible, and yet enough to ſink the Soul: Therefore the third Conviction is of the <hi>love of God,</hi> that hath provided a means of pardon and acceptation: when a Man throughly convinced of the unprofitableneſs and deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateneſs of his actions and condition, his extream In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude unto God, ſhall for all this hear a voice, after all thoſe things; <hi>Return back thou back-ſliding Iſrael, and I will not cauſe mine anger to fall upon you; for I am merciful, and will not keep mine anger for ever, only acknowledge thine iniquity,</hi> Jer. 3.12, 13. This conquers the Soul not only into a diſlike of ſin paſt, as dangerous and unprofitable, but unto a hatred of it, and of our ſelves for it, as the enemy to ſuch an invincible Love. The Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:50435:165"/>
of our ways paſt, and comparing them with the Law, will enforce the Conſcience to condemn them, but it muſt be the ſenſe of the Love and Goodneſs of God in Chriſt, that can only incline us to change them: as by the former, he concludes his ways dangerous and unprofitable, ſo without the latter, he will conclude his Repentance unuſeful. And hereupon the Soul is caſt into ſuch Expreſſions as theſe:
<q>O Lord, I have been conſidering the preſent temper of my Heart, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viewed the courſe of my Life, and have compared them with the Duty I owe unto thee, and the Law which thou gaveſt me to be the Rule of that Duty; and I find my heart and ways infinitely diſpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to that Rule, and thereby I conclude my ſelf a moſt ungrateful, and a miſerable Creature: But though I have ſinned away that ſtock of Grace and Bleſſedneſs, with which I was once intruſted by thee, I find I have not out-ſinned that Fountain of Goodneſs and Mercy, that is in thee; even whiles the ſight and ſenſe of my own Condition, bids me deſpair either of repenting or acceptation of it, yet I hear the voice of that Majeſty which I have injured, bids me Return and live, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.32. Were there no acceptance of my turning from thoſe ways of death and deſtruction, yet it were my duty; and though thy Juſtice might juſtly reject it, yet it might juſtly require it: But yet when thy merciful and free Promiſe ſhall crown my Repentance with Acceptation and Life: This Love conſtrains beyond the ſenſe of my own miſery. And when I hear the voice of my Lord calling to me to return, and I will heal your backſlidings, that Love warms my Heart into that anſwer, Behold, I will come unto thee, for thou art the Lord my God, <hi>Jer</hi> 3.22. But who can come unto thee, unleſs thou draw him? ſend therefore thy Power along with thy Command, for it is not of him that willeth, nor of him
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:50435:165"/>
that runneth: Turn me, and I ſhall be turned; I will engage the uttermoſt of my ſtrength, to forſake my ways; but I will ſtill wait upon the ſame Mercy, that did invite me, to enable me to forſake them.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>By that which preceeds we ſee <hi>a double Repentance:</hi> 1. That which is <hi>Preparatory</hi> unto the receiving of Chriſt, which is nothing elſe but a ſenſe of the unhappineſs and evil of our ways, as deſtructive unto our Happineſs, and diſſonant from that Rule of Righteouſneſs, which we cannot but naturally ſubſcribe to be Juſt and Good: and this doth naturally breed a Sorrow for what hath been ſo done, and a Purpoſe and Inclination of Heart to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake thoſe ways. And this was the work of the Baptiſt, to prepare the way of the Lord; his Doctrine was a Doctrine of Repentance, and his Baptiſm, a Baptiſm of Repentance, a Seal of the Entertainment of that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to as many as received it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Acts</hi> 19.4. 2. That which is <hi>Subſequent</hi> to that enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of Chriſt in the Heart by Faith, which is the ſenſe of the love of God in Chriſt continuing towards us, notwithſtanding our many Injuries. This fills the Heart with Sorrow and Wonder, and puts the Soul upon a flat Reſolution, never to ſin againſt ſo great Love. This was that ſorrow that pricked the <hi>Jews</hi> to the heart, and brought in Repentance for remiſſion of ſins, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37, 38. <hi>Acts</hi> 3.19. that Sorrow that work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Repentance unto Salvation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10. And though ſometimes Chriſt appear unto the Soul without a Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt, and the light of the Love of God diſcovers the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity and filthineſs of our former ways and tempers; yet the uſual method of his Grace and Providence is to baptize<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with the Baptiſm of <hi>John;</hi> and after with the Baptiſm of Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 19.5. The love of God being moſt naturally welcome, and operative when the Soul hath before taken a juſt ſurvey of his Condition without the ſight of that love: But his ways are unſearchable, and paſt finding out.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="294" facs="tcp:50435:166"/>And this Evangelical Repentance, <hi>viz.</hi> our ſorrow for our paſt Offences and our purpoſe of better Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, is not only the Act of our firſt Converſion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, but is to be our continual Exerciſe: there is a continual adherence of our fleſh and ſin unto us; and notwithſtanding the bent and frame of the Soul be changed, yet there are continual Renewed Offences, which though God is pleaſed not to impute, yet as they are contrary to that Life in the Soul, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will be oppoſed by that Life, ſo they are ſtill na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally our own and therefore muſt and will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of and ſorrowed for: For a Soul once truly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the Love of God, would willingly have his whole Man, and Life, and Thoughts and World conformable to the Will of God: and therefore every ſtrugling cannot chuſe but cauſe ſorrow, and gather up the ſtrength of the Soul for the future againſt it. For the ſins of the very Members of Chriſt, though by his Righteouſneſs and Satisfaction they have loſt their power to condemn, being his by imputation; yet they are ſins ſtill, and therefore objects of our oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and ours in reality, and therefore objects of our Sorrow and Repentance: and by how much the more they have our conſent, by ſo much the more they are ſins, and ours. And as it is the Power and Grace of Chriſt, that ſubdues the Dominion and prevailing of Sin; ſo this Grace doth work by ſetting the operations and affections of the Soul againſt it, eſpecially in our Sorrow and Repentance. Our Repentance after Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion is nothing elſe, but the ſtrugling of the Life of Chriſt, to work out that poyſon of ſin, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary unto it, and doth weaken it, and would deſtroy it, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.9. <hi>For his ſeed remaineth in him, and he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſin, becauſe he is born of God.</hi>

Mortification therefore is nothing elſe, but the daily practice of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition againſt Sin, eſpecially ſuch as we are moſt inclined to, and that by ſuch Means as are reaſonably conducing to it. Theſe <hi>Means,</hi> according to the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral tempers, both ſpiritual and natural, are more or leſs effectual; I ſhall divide them into theſe <hi>degrees:</hi> 1. Supernatural Helps. 2. Moral or Rational Helps. 3. Natural Helps.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Supernatural:</hi> They are rational Means, but fixt upon ſupernatural objects, and diſcovered by ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Light; for it will moſt clearly appear, that theſe very Helps which we call Supernatural, are moſt rationally effectual againſt it:</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="296" facs="tcp:50435:167"/>Meditation and Prayer.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Meditation,</hi> and ſerious and deep Conſideration of the Word of God, and the Truths therein revealed, but eſpecially of theſe enſuing:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. A deep Meditation <hi>of the Love of God,</hi> whom I muſt needs offend in every ſin. And this is the moſt powerful Conſideration in the World to mortifie any ſin; and that is the reaſon why, where there is the trueſt and higheſt manifeſtation of the Love of God to the Soul, there is the higheſt Purity; becauſe there is the higheſt Preſervative againſt Sin: for it muſt needs be clear, that where there is the higheſt manifeſtation of the Love of God to the Soul, there is the higheſt Love again to God; and conſequently the moſt abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute dominion over ſin: for as the Love of God is the cauſe of our Love to him, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.19. ſo according to the meaſure of the manifeſtation of the Love of God to the Soul, is the meaſure of the Love of the Soul to God again; and conſequently of the hatred of ſin: And he, that often and deeply conſiders of the Love of God, muſt even rationally improve the ſenſe of it to his Soul, and conſequently his Love to God again, and his abhorrence of Sin. When a Man ſhall take ſuch Conſiderations as theſe into him;
<q>God hath commanded me to abſtain from this or that ſin, whereunto, it may be, my Nature, my Cuſtom, my Temptation, inclines me: The competition is between my Pleaſure, my Pride, my Profit, and my Lord; he that gave me a Being; he that hath given me all the Comforts of my Being; he that might juſtly have taken me away to judgment in the midſt of my ſin; but he hath ſpared me, and waited upon me, that he might, though I were righteous, make me a veſſel of miſery; he that hath invited, perſwaded, intreated me to return unto him for my own good; that when I would not, I could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:50435:167"/>
unto him, hath ſent his Son to fetch me, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem me with the greateſt Price that ever the World heard of: <hi>Behold what manner of love.</hi> 1 John 3.1. And ſhall I, can I make ſo ill a return? to entertain his Enemy, the only object of his diſpleaſure, that will ruine me, before my Lord, that hath infinitely out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done my higheſt ſpeculations for me?</q>
Certainly the ſenſe of the Love of God is either not at all, or not awake, when any Man conſiderately commits any the leaſt ſin againſt his Conſcience: It were no leſs, than for a Man to return deſpight againſt the Love of God, and, as much as in us lies, to diſappoint his very End and Purpoſe in ſending of Chriſt, who therefore gave himſelf for us, to redeem us from all iniquity, and purifie unto himſelf a peculiar People, zealous of good works.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. A ſerious Conſideratiun <hi>of the great and high Hope, to which we are reſtored by the purchace of Chriſt, and the great Incongruity that there is between continuing in Sin and that Hope.</hi> We expect to be brought to an innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable company of Angels, to the Aſſembly of the firſt, born, to the Spirits of juſt Men made perfect, to Jeſus the Mediator of the new Covenant, to God the Judge of all, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.22. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be make like unto the Son of God, and to be partakers of his Sonſhip, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.2. To partake of his Spirit, to ſee the brightneſs of the glory of God in Chriſt: now all theſe are holy: how unſuitable a thing is it for a Man that hath his Hope, not to purifie himſelf, even as he is pure? 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.3. This will teach a Man to beſpeak his Heart thus:
<q>Is the Preſence of God thy Hope? he is the Holy, Holy, Holy Lord, that is of purer Eyes than to behold, or to be beholden by any unclean thing: If therefore thou commit Sin, thou liveſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thy Hope: either therefore let thy Hope be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to thy Life, or thy Life to thy Hope.</q>

                           <pb n="298" facs="tcp:50435:168"/>3. A ſerious Conſideration <hi>of the Preſence of the Great, and Juſt and Powerful God:</hi> his Eyes run to and fro through the Earth, to behold the Evil and the Good, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.9. He is acquainted with all my ways, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.3. His Eyes are upon all the ways of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Men, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.19. The Hearts of Men, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.11. and all things are naked and manifeſt before him with whom we have to do: And dareſt thou ſin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the face of thy Judge, who ſees thee, and whoſe Power or Juſtice thou canſt not eſcape? this is ſo great a Controll, that were it ſoundly and deeply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, it would ſtifle even the firſt motions of ſin, and therefore it is the great work of our own wicked Heart, either to gull themſelves into a perſwaſion, that God ſees not, <hi>Job</hi> 22.13. or elſe in plain Engliſh, to forbid him their Hearts: they ſay to God, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from us, for we deſire not the knowledge of thy ways, <hi>Job</hi> 22.14.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. A deep Conſideration <hi>of the Nature and Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of Sin:</hi> It is a Violation of a Righteous and Juſt Law, the Law of a Juſt and Righteous God, a Law, the conformity whereunto, is the Perfection and Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs of the Creature: By this ſin I loſe my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with my Creator, and conſequently, Peace within my ſelf: whiles I commit it, my fruition is but ſhort, and mingled with Fear, becauſe the end of it, Death, is in ſome degree preſent with my Soul, and ſowers that tranſitory Content which I enjoy in it; and when it is finiſhed, it brings forth Sorrow, and Shame, and Death: and if that Sorrow end in Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, yet the bitterneſs of that Sorrow overweighs the Pleaſure that I had in its commiſſion; and according to the meaſure of the delight I had in my ſin, ſo, and much more is the meaſure of my ſorrow in repenting; and yet for all this, that Peace, which I had formerly with my God and my Conſcience, very hardly reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered;
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:50435:168"/>
and God, though he pardons my ſin, yet ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not at all, or not ſuddenly, truſting me with that meaſure of Communion with him, which I formerly enjoyed and abuſed. But if the ſorrow of Repentance wait not upon my ſin, a worſe ſorrow attends it: the ſin is paſt, and ſo is the contentment, but the ſtorm that attends it, is Everlaſting: the loſs of the light of God's love, the loſs of an Eternal weight of Glory, the terrible appearance of an angry God, cloathed with as much Terror, as Juſtice provoked, Patience abuſed, and Mercy contemned by a moſt indebted Creature, can aſſume. And this Terror ſhaken into the moſt tender and ſenſible parts of the Soul by the hand of Omnipotence it ſelf, and that unto all Eternity, when my Life ſhall be full of nothing but the preapprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of my future miſery, my death, the terrible, inexorable, and inevitable paſſage to it: Shall I then ſo madly prize the ſatisfying of a baſe, a periſhing Luſt for a ſeaſon? thus throw away my God, my Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, my ſelf, when the thing it ſelf is ſo baſe and tranſitory, and the wages ſo ſad and diſmal? It ſhall be my care to avoid, to ſubdue, to crucifie that, which as it cannot ſatisfie, ſo it will certainly torment and ruine me. And ſince I find my Luſts to be ſo eaſily actuated into Sin by every Temptation, I ſhall by the Grace of God, as avoid the latter, ſo keep a ſtrict hand over the former; and it ſhall be my hourly care to ranſack and examine, and ſearch my Heart, what is moulding there, and to cleanſe and waſh it from its pollutions; or at leaſt to mingle my Tears and Sorrows with them, that ſo they may be weary of my Heart, or my Heart of them. But, Lord, <hi>Who underſtandeth the errors of his life? Cleanſe thou me from my ſecret ſins, and keep thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant from preſumptuous ſins, Pſal.</hi> 19.12.</p>

out my ſalvation with fear and trembling: and the <hi>Time</hi> wherein I have to do it, is in this Life, and that but a ſhort and an uncertain Life: the great <hi>Enemies</hi> to my Soul, are the Luſts of my Fleſh, and of my Mind, which fight againſt my Soul: If the work be not done in my Life-time, the Door is ſhut; and who knows whether this or that Sin which I am now about to commit, may not be concluded with my Life? and then in what a caſe am I? how ſhall I appear before the Holy and Eternal God with the ſtain of that ſin upon me? or if he prolong my days, yet who knows whether he will not ſeal up my Soul with impenitency? If my Luſt prevail upon me now, it gathers ſtrength, and vexeth that Spirit, which muſt only enable me for the future, to repent and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt it; and if I get the Victory over the conteſtations of the Spirit of God, my Conqueſt ends in my own Miſery and Slavery. It may be, I have over-matched and ſtifled the Perſwaſions of the Spirit of God, of that Lighit which he hath ſet up in my Conſcience, that did ſting me in the midſt of my Cariere after my Luſts, and mingled them with bitterneſs to my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, and now I purſue my Deſires without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption: yet when I remember that Death is at my heels, and will overtake me before I can overtake my Contentment in the things I purſue; that if I over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live a ſudden unexpected Death, yet the Harbingers of Death, Sickneſs, or Age, cannot be far off, and either of theſe, as they will take off the edge of my Purſuit, and fruitions of my Luſts, and render them inſipid, ſo they will thereby give leiſure and opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to me to caſt up the Accounts of my paſt Life, and find therein nothing but Vanity and Unprofitableneſs; Time, that might have been improved to Eternity, irrecoverably loſt in thoſe Purſuits, that have left no footſteps of Content in my Soul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A SAD and deep Conſideration of <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbecomingneſs of the Power and Dominion of any Luſt</hi> upon a Man. And this, though it be a moral Conſideration, is of good uſe for the mortifying of our Luſts. S. <hi>Paul</hi> divides our Luſts into the Luſts of the Fleſh, and the Luſts of the Mind: <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.3. S. <hi>John</hi> tells us, that <hi>all that is in the World, is the Luſt of the Fleſh, the Luſt of the Eyes, and the Pride of Life,</hi> 1 John 2.16. Out of both theſe, we may divide the Enemies of our Soul within us, into theſe Diviſions,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Luſt;</hi> which is nothing elſe, but the immoderate and inordinate actings of the Appetite, either beyond that meaſure it ought to be, or upon thoſe Objects it ought not to be. And this either</p>
                        <p n="1">1. In the Rational Appetite; thoſe are the Luſts of the Mind.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. In the Senſitive Appetite; thoſe again</p>
                        <p n="1">1. In the Luſts of the Fleſh.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The Luſt of the Eyes.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Pride,</hi> in an overvaluing of our ſelves in the fruition of thoſe things we have thus purſued.</p>
                        <p>Now we ſhall a little conſider, how far forth any of theſe do hold a diſproportion, even with right Reaſon.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The <hi>Luſts of the Mind.</hi> The great <hi>Deſire</hi> of the Mind, is that <hi>of Knowledge,</hi> an Appetite that God hath
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:50435:170"/>
put into the Soul of Man, and ſo a thing beautiful and good: But this very Deſire of Knowledge, becomes a Luſt of the Mind, when either it is miſplaced in reſpect of his Object; thus <hi>Adam</hi>'s deſire of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Good and Evil, became a Luſt: or when act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed beyond its proportion: The chiefeſt Object of our Love, ought to be the chiefeſt object of our Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and conſequently of our deſire of Knowledge, and that is only God: and he is to be known, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, we ought to deſire to know him, as he hath revealed himſelf in his Word, in his Works, and by his Spirit. When either therefore we deſire to know, even in things pertaining to God, beyond what we ought to know, as the Counſels of his Will, looking into the Ark; or when we deſire to know things of an inferiour nature with an over-intenſive deſire, which is only due to God; our want of Sobriety in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and our want of Moderation in the latter, turns our deſire of Knowledge into a Luſt of the Mind, or when acted without his due End: Good, and the fruition of it, is the great and final object of the Soul, and as the Acts of the Underſtanding are preparatory to the Will, ſo Knowledge, and the deſire of it, is, or ſhould be, preparatory to the fruition of ſome Good, farther and beyond the bare ſpeculative Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it: If it were poſſible for a Man truly to know God without the Love of him, and the ſenſe of his Love to the Soul, a deſire of ſuch a Knowledge, though I dare not term it a Luſt of the Mind, yet it is ſuch a deſire, as is not rightly qualified. To deſire to know a thing fit to be known, meerly becauſe I would know it; It is but a Luſt of the Mind, and ſuch a Knowledge as only puffeth up. Now any Man may rationally conclude, that ſuch deſires of the Mind as theſe, are even condemned of Reaſon it ſelf, as irregular and uſeleſs: It is true, that whatſoever is an
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:50435:171"/>
object of our Knowledge, may be an object of our deſire of Knowledge, if not forbidden by him that gave the Power; if acted with Moderation and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety; if ſubordinated to that deſire which I have, or ſhould have to that great object of my Knowledge: But for a Man to ſpend his choiceſt hours and thoughts, and inquiries upon unneceſſary, periſhing, uſeleſs ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; Reaſon it ſelf will conclude, as the Preacher would have the covetous Man, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 4.8. <hi>For what do I labour, and bereave my ſoul of good?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And as thus in the Intellectual Faculty, there are Luſts of the Mind, ſo are there in the Rational Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, <hi>the Will and Affections:</hi> The Paſſions in the Soul are natural to it, and therefore naturally good: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore want of natural Affection, is a thing condemned in the old World, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.31. But when theſe Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are acted beyond their natural end and uſe, they become corrupt and putrified, and ſo Luſts of the Mind. And this is ſeen in either Faculty, Iraſcible and Concupiſcible: and by how much the more ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual they are, by ſo much the more deviliſh and hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and yet condemned by ſound Reaſon.</p>
                        <p>The Paſſion of <hi>Anger</hi> was planted in the Mind, and is good, when acted upon a right object, and in a due meaſure, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.26. But this Paſſion being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted, it becomes putrified, and a Luſt of the Mind: it then turns into Malice, to Envy: <hi>The Spirit that is in us luſteth after Envy,</hi> Jam. 4.5. into deſire of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge: and thus Luſt conceiveth upon this Paſſion of the Soul, and bringeth forth Sin. Now all theſe are evidently againſt right Reaſon; Becauſe even ſound Reaſon teacheth us, to love all that is good: Every Being hath in it ſelf a goodneſs, and doth natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally challenge our Love; and therefore to deſire the deſtruction of any Being is againſt the Law and Rule of Reaſon; or to deſire a leſs or more low
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:50435:171"/>
degree of Being to it than it hath. It is true, there may be ſome irregularity in it, which I may and muſt hate: But when my hatred is in the concrete, and takes in the Being of any thing which is good, as well as that which I conceive an irregularity within the compaſs of it, as is in all Malice and Revenge; then is my Paſſion miſ-acted, corrupted, and proves a luſt of the Mind. Suppoſe a Man hath done me an extream injury, and intends to continue it, right Reaſon will diſcriminate between the Man and his Fault; and whiles it is angry with the Man, yet it hates him not; it will hate the Injuſtice of the Man, and deſtroy that, but not the Man: it may be he hates me without a cauſe, his Fault cannot juſtifie mine: God hath given him a Being, and is the only Lord of it; and that Being of his is good, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves my Love to preſerve it; his offence is the only object of my hatred, and cannot give me a Commiſſion to deſtroy the Subject. It is true, that in order to my preſervation, I may do ſuch a thing as may be prejudicial to him that hates me, with ſuch moderation, that the evil I do him, muſt not exceed the evil that otherwiſe I might ſuffer by him; for this is agreeable to right Reaſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But this muſt be without the leaſt grain of Revenge, ſo much as in my thought; For all Revenge hath in it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of Irregularity: The great God, to whom Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance alone belongs, <hi>Rom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> 12.19. that is abſolute Lord of his Creature, and therefore can owe him nothing, yet puniſheth not by way of Revenge, as a party injured, but by way of Juſtice, as the ſupream Judge, that inflicted that Penalty that was annexed to his righteous Law when he gave it: Nothing that one Creature could do to another could be ſaid to be Unjuſt, were it not that it is againſt the Law of this ſupream Law-giver and Judge; and therefore
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:50435:172"/>
Retribution in me that am injured, is an act of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, in God an act of his Juſtice: and when he inflicts his Puniſhment, though in reſpect of me, that ſuffered, it is his Revenge, yet in reſpect of his Law that is broken, it is but his own Juſtice.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Luſts of the Fleſh:</hi> There are certain Natural Propenſions in us for the preſervation of our tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral being and kind; thoſe are planted in our Nature by the God of Nature, as well as in the nature of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Creatures, and are in themſelves good, when acted according to that Rule which God hath given unto us. Thoſe <hi>Rules</hi> are ſuch as either are adequate to the Senſitive Nature, <hi>viz.</hi> That they ſhould be acted with due proportion, and to the end for which they are ſo implanted in our Nature: or ſuch as are applicable to them in reſpect of that higher degree of Being, that is in our Nature, <hi>viz.</hi> that they ſhould be acted with ſubordination to the dictate of right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: And when either of theſe fail, even theſe natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Propenſions do become Luſts of the Fleſh, and fight againſt the Soul; for they are not in their place, and conſequently breed a diſorder in the Soul. This is eaſie to be ſeen in the conſideration of both of theſe defects: The Appetite of Eating and Drinking is no Luſt, but a Propenſion incident to our Nature, for the Preſervation of the <hi>Compoſitum:</hi> But when a Man ſhall act it beyond its due proportion, eat or drink to Exceſs; or when a Man ſhall uſe it to a wrong End, to eat or drink, becauſe he will eat and drink, placing the end of his Appetite in the uſe of it; now he tranſgreſſeth the firſt Rule, he makes his Belly his God; and his Appetite becomes a Luſt. Again, if a Man ſhall give way to his Appetite, though in a due proportion, or to a due end, yet if upon rational Circumſtances a greater Good ſhall be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by loſt, or a greater Evil thereby incurred, then
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:50435:172"/>
this Appetite becomes a Luſt, becauſe it is out of its place, and wants its due ſubordination to right Reaſon; as when my eating or drinking ſhall ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize my weak Brother, for whom Chriſt died, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.28. and thereby bring a greater loſs to him, than good to my ſelf. Again, if either the Providential Diſpenſation of God, or his Command, be againſt it, it makes the exerciſe of that Appetite to become a Luſt, becauſe it wants that ſubordination to right Reaſon; for it is the moſt uncontrollable Principle of Reaſon, to bear an univerſal ſubjection to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and Will of God: Thus when God by the courſe of his Providence, called to faſting, then to find ſlaying of Oxen and killing of Sheep, the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite becomes a Luſt. Again, when God forbad the eating of the Fruit of the Tree of Knowledge, of Good and Evil, then <hi>Adam</hi>'s eating becomes a Luſt, and conſequently, a ſnare unto him; for his ſenſitive Appetite was out of its place, it ſhould have been ſubordinate to his Reaſon, but it was above it. And theſe Exceſſes of the fleſhly Appetite are expreſſed by ſeveral Expreſſions in the Word of Truth: ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Fleſh, <hi>Galat.</hi> 6.8. making proviſion for the Fleſh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. <hi>ult.</hi> warring after the Fleſh, 2 <hi>

<pb n="308" facs="tcp:50435:173"/>
the Law of the Mind, and bringing it into captivity. It is a ſad thing for any Man to think, that ſuch a diſorder ſhould be in the Soul, that the nobler part born to rule, ſhould be a Captive and a Slave to the inferiour part of Man; much more when that noble part ſhall become a willing Vaſſal, and Proſtitute to that part of Man, which is no higher than a Beaſt; and not only ſo, but improve its own Ability, Wit, Skill, and Power to make that part of our Nature below a ſenſitive Creature. The Beaſts, as hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved before, though their ſenſual Appetite be their higheſt Faculty, and ſo moves not in a ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to any higher Power, yet they move conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the End, for which thoſe Propenſions were implanted in them: But when the ſenſual Appetite in Man hath captivated his Reaſon, which ſhould be her guide and ruler, it is made the worſe by her Priſoner; and now its motions are not only abſolute, and without controll of Reaſon, excentrick to that very natural Rule given to the motions of the ſame ſenſitive Appetite in the very Senſitives themſelves: And the reaſon is partly becauſe the Wiſdom of God hath given a kind of natural Law or Boundary to thoſe Propenſions in the Senſitives, becauſe they have no higher Power in them to regulate them; but to Man he gave a higher Power to order and manage this ſenſual Appetite, which Power having loſt his ſovereignty, the ſenſual Appetite doth not only want his Bounds, but alſo having corrupted and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed that higher Faculty, is again corrupted by it, and made by her captive, and at length by Cuſtom, the reaſonable Soul becomes only an Inſtrument to contrive and execute the moſt exquiſite ſatisfaction it can for thoſe Luſts of the Fleſh.</p>
                        <p>Now as any Man that hath ſo much command of his Mind, as a little to call it off from this drudgery,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:50435:173"/>
cannot chuſe but conclude the extream unfitneſs and uncomelineſs of ſuch a tranſpoſition of his Faculties; ſo when it pleaſeth God to open our Eyes, that we can ſee the ſtate and frame of our Minds and Souls, as once the Prophet's Servant's Eyes were opened to ſee that better ſight of the heavenly Hoſt, we ſhould ſee more confuſion, diſcrepancy and diſorder in our Souls, more cruelty, miſchief, and filthineſs, by reaſon of the rule of thoſe Luſts within us, than if we ſhould ſee the Slaves of a once well-governed City in a Rebellion, maſtering their Lords, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them ſerve to their baſeſt Commands, rifling their Treaſures, burning their Habitations, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all places, Orders and things into ruine and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion. And therefore the ſtudy of the reducing theſe Rebels to their former ſubjection, even by ſtrict ſeverity and diſcipline, which is the Buſineſs of Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, cannot chuſe but be a moſt rational Work.</p>
                        <p>Now from this diſorder, that ariſeth in the Soul by the Old Man, which is nothing elſe but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting and diſplacing of thoſe powers and motions of the Creature, from that beautiful and conformable Place and Order, wherein God had once ſet them, proceed all thoſe enormities and confuſions that are in the World, <hi>James</hi> 4.1. <hi>From whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your luſts that war in your members?</hi> Luſt hath made a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order and tumult within, and there it cannot reſt long, but works the like without alſo. God hath ſet every thing in his place and order, and bounded it with certain Limits and Rules; and as long as they keep within their Places, Orders and Rules, there is Beauty and Concordance with it ſelf, and other things; but when that Order and Rule of things is broken, then follows Confuſion and Deformity; and as the things ſo diſplaced diſagree with other things,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:50435:174"/>
that are in their Places and Orders, ſo thoſe muſt needs diſagree with them; much more muſt things that are out of their Places and Orders diſagree one with another. When a Man over-maſtered by any Luſt, meets with another Man over-maſtered with the ſame, or any other Luſt, there muſt needs be a diſcord between them: theſe are the Works of the Fleſh <hi>ad extra,</hi> Gal. 5.19.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The <hi>Luſt of the Eyes.</hi> The wiſe Man tells us, <hi>The Eye is not ſatisfied with ſeeing,</hi> Prov. 27.20. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ 1.8. And this is natural to the capacity of that ſenſe, and may be uſeful: But that which is princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally meant by this Luſt, is the over-eager proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch Objects, as are moſt delightful to the Eye, <hi>viz.</hi> of Wealth, which is Covetouſneſs; and of Honour, or High Place, which is Ambition: Theſe two Luſts are proſecuted upon a double ground: 1. As things pleaſing to our ſight; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that the Wiſe Man concludes, that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt good in the moſt ſubſtantial of them, is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of them with the Eyes of the Owner, <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ.</hi> 5.11.

uſe to our preſent ſubſiſtence, and may be deſired and endeavoured for with moderation, in order to our preſervation, poſterity, and ſafety: But then it becomes a Luſt, when they are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valued, and conſequently over eagerly proſecuted; and then by degrees the Man is ſo captivated with it, and habituated to it, that as he placed his Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city in his temporal Being here, ſo he placeth the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, ſtrength, and life of this Felicity in his Honour or Wealth; and ſo makes it his God, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.5. For as it is agreeable to our corrupt Nature, to make that our Idol, wherein, or whereby we find the greateſt ſenſible good conveyed to us, be it an Oni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or a Calf, or a Crocodile, as was the uſe of the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> ſo if we once exceed thoſe Bounds of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, which we ought to bear towards any ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible good, it believes an Idol; for it takes away part of that Portion of Love and Duty, which we owe to God, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.10, 11. The ſame that God is to a Man that is righteous, the ſame doth a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous Man make his Riches, <hi>viz.</hi> his ſtrong City. It is impoſſible, but Man muſt needs find himſelf a depending Creature upon ſomewhat without him; he cannot live without Meat, Drink, Cloathing, ſupport againſt Injuries, Violence, and Want, he hath loſt the Knowledge of God, upon whom in truth his dependance is, and therefore faſtens upon that which is moſt viſibly in his way for his ſupport, Riches and External Power: and this he concludes and reſolves to compaſs <hi>per fas &amp; nefas,</hi> even through the deſtruction and blood of thoſe that ſtand in his way: And having attained to ſome convenient pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, yet partly through the emptineſs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulneſs of the Object, which we purſue, partly through the inſatiableneſs of that Luſt, which we

Theſe, and the like Conſiderations, deeply digeſted, will make a Man to carry a looſe affection and purſuit of Riches or Honour, and put the Soul upon ſuch Reſolutions and Contemplations as theſe:
<q>O Lord, thou haſt brought me into this World, wherein is great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of all things; and I ſee the men of this World hunting and purſuing after Wealth, and Honour, and Power, and making it the buſineſs of their Lives; and in this their purſuit often diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and if ſucceſsful, yet full of anxiety; and if they attain any meaſure of what they purſue, yet are ſtill unſatisfied in what they have attained; and yet conſider not that there is a Lie in their right hand: and what Profit hath he that laboureth for the Wind? A Wind that may ſwell and torment, but not ſatisfie the Soul: And it is evident, that oftentimes, though thy Providence ſucceed their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and Ambitions, ſo that they ſeem to have rolled up their Stone almoſt to the top of their Wiſhes; yet the encounter of, it may be, a ſmall, and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly inconſiderable Circumſtance tumbles all down again, if not to their ruine, yet to their vexation and diſappointment. And thus we walk in a vain ſhadow, and diſquiet our ſelves in vain, and ſpend that ſtock of Time, and Life, and Strength, and Opportunity in unprofitable, unſatisfactory Labour, till the Night overtakes us, and then whoſe ſhall all theſe things be? <hi>Luke</hi> 12.20.

                        <p n="3">3. The <hi>Pride of Life:</hi> There are <hi>two great Cardinal Truths,</hi> whereof if the Mind be ſoundly convinced, it puts a Man in a right frame and temper of Spirit in the whole courſe of his Life:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That there is an eſſential univerſal <hi>Subjection due</hi> from all Creatures <hi>to the Will and Power of God:</hi> This is the ground of all true Obedience, and all true <hi>Humility;</hi> which is nothing elſe, but a putting of the Mind into a Poſture and frame anſwerable to that Poſition, wherein by Nature it is framed, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of the Mind to the Truth and Station where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is ſet.</p>
                        <p n="2">(2.) That all Goodneſs, Beauty, and Perfection, is originally in God, and nothing of Good, Beauty, or Perfection is in any thing, but derivatively from him, according to that meaſure, that he is freely pleaſed to communicate. This keeps the Heart in a continual Love of him, Dependance upon him, and Thankfulneſs unto him.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="319" facs="tcp:50435:178"/>From the Ignorance of thoſe, is the ground of all the <hi>Pride</hi> in the World, which is nothing elſe, but a falſe placing of the Mind in ſuch a Condition or Station, or the opinion of ſuch a Station wherein in truth, he is not, and ſo it diſorders the Mind: it makes a Man, that is eſſentially ſubordinate to God, and depending upon him, to place himſelf above God, and to be independent upon him: And though this falſe opinion cannot alter his condition in truth; for he that hath ſaid, My Will ſhall ſtand, cannot be removed by the pride or reſiſtance of Man; yet as to the Man himſelf, it puts him out of his place, and in the room of God: And therefore above all other diſtempers of the Soul, this is the moſt hateful to God: for as the proud Man reſiſteth God, and labours to get into his place, ſo God reſiſteth him, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.5. <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.24. And this Ignorance, or not full ſubſcription to theſe two Truths, will appear to be the foundation of all the Pride in Men.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. From the Ignorance of the former, of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection we owe to God, proceeds that Pride that manifeſts it ſelf in Rebellion and Diſobedience againſt God. God challengeth the ſubjection of our Wills to his, as juſtly he may, and Man will have his own Will take place, <hi>Jer.</hi> 42.14. <hi>No, but we will go into the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="320" facs="tcp:50435:179"/>
from this ignorance of that ſubjection we owe to God, proceeds that Haughtineſs and Arrogance, which we find in the Spirits of Men, <hi>Exod.</hi> 5.2. <hi>Who is the Lord, that I ſhould let the people go?</hi> Job 21.15. <hi>What is the Almighty, that we ſhould ſerve him?</hi> Dan. 3.15. <hi>Who is that God, that ſhall deliver you out of my hands?</hi> This Ignorance was that which bred that haughty ſpeech in <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> Dan. 4.30. <hi>Is not this great Babylon,</hi> &amp;c. Till God by his immediate hand made him know, that he is able to abaſe them that walk in pride, <hi>Ibid.</hi> Verſe 37. And hence it is, that Men are compaſſed with Pride, as a Chain, when they ſet their mouth againſt the Heavens, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.6, 9, 11. And this manifeſtation of Pride, is principally in the Will, becauſe it is the abſence of that ſubjection, which we owe to his Will.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. From this want of the due knowledge of the ſubjection, we owe to the Power of God, proceeds that Pride which evidenceth it ſelf in that vain Confidence and Security, which men put in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or thoſe other acceſſions of Friends, Wealth, Power, Policy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Revel. 3.17. <hi>I am rich and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed in goods, and have need of nothing,</hi> Luke 12.17. <hi>And I will ſay to my ſoul, Soul, thou haſt much goods laid up for many years, take thine eaſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> Iſa. 28.14. <hi>When the over-flowing ſcourge ſhall paſs through, it ſhall not come near us, for we have made lies our refuge, and under falſhood, have we hid our ſelves.</hi> This was the ſpeech of the ſcornful Men of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> who had not Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility enough to ſhelter themſelves under their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, and yet had ſo much Baſeneſs of Spirit, as to make a Lie their Refuge and Security, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.2. truſt in a ſhadow; <hi>Verſe</hi> 12. in oppreſſion and perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 31.1. in Horſes and Chariots, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 47.7. <hi>I ſhall be a Lady for ever: I am, and there is none elſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides me:</hi> to ſee the pride and arrogance of a Heart,
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:50435:179"/>
that knows not God, even to take upon it the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſelf-ſufficiency of God himſelf. Now when a Heart truly knows the Power of God, the eſſential Dependance that all things and events have upon him, how eaſily, without the interpoſition of his own immediate hand, he can manage ſome little inconſiderable Circumſtance, to break and confound the moſt complicated and twiſted Securities that a whole Nation can make for it ſelf; he will ſoon learn to look upon all theſe external contributions to Happineſs and Safety, as vanity and nothing, much leſs will he repoſe any confidence in them. And to break the Children of Men from this dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying themſelves, and the ſparks that they have kindled, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 50.11. God doth moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as I may ſay, ſet himſelf to blaſt and ſubvert thoſe Refuges of Men, their Idols, with the moſt unlikely and improbable means, <hi>Job</hi> 5.13. <hi>He catcheth the wiſe, even with their own craftineſs,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangles the Powerful by their own ſtrength; or arms ſome impotent, unexpected Emergency, a nothing, in a moment to ſhatter in pieces what Men have been many Years or Ages building up, and fortifying into a Confidence, with multiplicity of Supplies.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. By the Ignorance of the latter, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Original of all Good is in, and from God, ariſeth that Haughtineſs and Elevation of Mind, that is in Men, when they find any thing in themſelves, or in what they have acquired, that is beautiful or uſeful. When a Heart rightly principled, meddles with any ſuch thing, it teacheth him Thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Humility; he runs it up preſently to God, the Fountain and Original of all Good, and gives him the praiſe of any thing he finds Good in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and concludes even in the meaneſt Good,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:50435:180"/>
that he finds, even in his Skill, it may be, in the loweſt Profeſſion, with <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 28.29. <hi>This alſo cometh forth from the Lord of hoſts, who is wonderful in counſel, and excellent in working:</hi> If he finds in himſelf an induſtrious and ſucceſsful Hand, he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes this to God, <hi>Deuteronom.</hi> 8.18. It is he that giveth thee Power to get Wealth: If he finds himſelf advanced to any Greatneſs or Honour, he acknowledgeth this to be the Diſpenſation of God, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 75.7. <hi>God is the Judge, he putteth down one, and ſetteth up another:</hi> If he find a victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and ſucceſsful Hand in War, he attributes it not to his own Sword, or his own Arm, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.3. <hi>But thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance:</hi> If he find any Eminence of Wiſdom, Knowledge, Counſel, Learning, ſtill he remembers that it cometh down from the Father of Lights, <hi>James</hi> 1.17. But the Ignorance, or want of Conſideration of this, is that which puf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feth up a Man, by carrying that Glory, which is indeed due to God, unto himſelf: A Man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have a little more Knowledge than he ſees in another, but preſently it ſwells him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.1. he thinks higher of himſelf than he ought to think, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.3. If he get a little Wealth, preſently he concludes, <hi>Deuteronom.</hi> 8.17. <hi>My power, and the might of my hand, hath gotten me this wealth.</hi> If he hath been ſucceſsful in his Counſels, he preſently beſpeaks himſelf with the inſolent <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> Iſa. 10.13. <hi>By the ſtrength of my hand have I done it, and by my wiſdom, for I am prudent.</hi> And what a tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſe Heart ſaith to God, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 21.13. <hi>Be thou exalted in thy own ſtrength,</hi> this proud Fool ſays to himſelf, and, ſo much as he can, makes himſelf God, ſtopping the Current of that Glory at himſelf, which would naturally run unto God,

as the Rivers into the Sea; and thereby the Man filleth himſelf beyond his proportion, till he ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit upon that, which belongs not unto him: And therefore the Prophet well ſaith, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.4. <hi>His ſoul, which is lifted up, is not upright in him;</hi> his Heart is out of his due place and ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and conſequently, as he diſorders other things, ſo he ruines himſelf; for the eternal Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Goodneſs of God, doth communicate his Goodneſs to every thing in that place and ſituation, which he hath appointed for it, and if the Heart get up above that place, which God hath appointed for it, it is no wonder, if it miſs of his Bleſſing, by reaſon of its diſorder, and, with <hi>Herod,</hi> find his Vengeance for its Preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XVII.</hi> Of Prayer.</head>
                        <p>THUS far concerning the Mortification of our Luſts, by the help of Meditation; the next is <hi>Prayer.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>God, as he is the Original of all Being, ſo he is the Fountain of all that Good, which is, or can be in the Creature: and this Goodneſs is derived to it from God by ſuch means as he hath appointed, and is moſt natural and ſuitable to the Creature. Man is eſſentially depending upon God, as well as other Creatures: here is the difference, other Creatures are placed in a greater diſtance from God, and there<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore he conveys his Goodneſs unto them by more mediate and inferiour means. Man, as he was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in a Perfection nearer unto God, even in his own Image, ſo conſequently, in a nearer degree and relation unto him; and therefore, though all things are in their Nature dependant upon him, yet Man hath ability to know his Dependance; and therefore not only to be dependent, but to be dependent upon him; and therefore upon all occaſions might make his immediate Addreſs to God, to whom he was immediately ſubject. Now Prayer and Thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving is nothing elſe, but the actual exerciſe of that Dependance we have upon God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.15. <hi>Call upon me in the day of trouble, I will deliver thee, and thou ſhalt glorifie me.</hi> When Man begins to forget his Dependance upon God, he leaves him to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and being out of his way, ſome trouble or
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:50435:181"/>
other meets him; and then he ſees he was out of his way, and returns to his Dependance again, prays to God. Our Prayers are not of themſelves effectual; but it was the bounty and good pleaſure of God to give unto his Creature all ſuitable good, whiles he is in ſuch a Station and Condition, as he requires of him. That Station for a Man is a continual actual Dependance upon God, which can never be without a ſuitable Conformity of the whole Soul to his Will. Now when the Heart is in ſuch a frame of Dependency, it actually exerciſeth it in Prayer; he ſtrengthens, as well as evidenceth his Dependance, and draweth himſelf nearer to God thereby, and ſo near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to Bleſſing.</p>
                        <p>Now in reference to this particular, <hi>viz. How Prayer becomes a means of our Mortification</hi> of thoſe ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularities in our Soul and Affections; it is upon a double ground:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Becauſe thereby the Soul draws near unto God, and ſo is lifted in ſome degree into that frame, and temper, and place, and ſtation, which is proper for it; and ſo gets above thoſe Luſts and Diſtempers, which hang about him: The very vicinity to that pure fire and light cannot conſiſt with the fellowſhip of thoſe impure Angels of darkneſs and impurity, and ſo either diſſolves them, or at leaſt ſcatters and affrights them. Hence Prayer is expreſſed by lifting up the Soul unto God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.1. by coming into his preſence, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95.2. by drawing near unto God, <hi>James</hi> 4.8. an acceſs to the throne of Grace. As when <hi>Adam</hi> had firſt departed from God by ſin, he after hid himſelf from the preſence of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.8. and thereby, as much as in him was, put himſelf out of a poſſibility of recovery; ſo when a Man again brings his Soul into the preſence of God (as an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs and power is now given by Chriſt) by that very
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:50435:182"/>
approaching unto God he gets maſtery of thoſe Luſts, that did formerly drive him, and, as much as they could keep him from God. And this was the very way of Perfection that God himſelf taught <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 17.1. <hi>Walk before me, and be thou perfect.</hi> And though the whole Converſation of a Chriſtian Man, ought to be in the preſence of God, and to meaſure all his thoughts and actions by their comelineſs, or uncomelineſs in his ſight; yet Prayer is a more ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial purpoſed concentring of the Soul to that Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs. And though, God knows, when we come down from the Mount again, oftentimes thoſe Luſts meet with us, and renew acquaintance with us, which we left behind, when we went about this ſerious Buſineſs, ſo that though we have ended the Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, we have yet a continual uſe of the Duty; yet a frequent a ſolemn, and ſerious uſe of this Duty interrupts a cuſtom of ſin, by degrees weakens the Old Man, and will in time, make a ſtrangeneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our Luſts and our Souls. And let a Man be ſure of theſe <hi>two truths:</hi> That as he that comes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Knees with a ſecret Purpoſe to hold confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy with any ſin, he ſhall be the worſe, the more hardned, the more neglected by that God, which ſearcheth the Heart: <hi>If I regard iniquity in my Heart, thou wilt not hear my Prayer:</hi> ſo whoſoever he be, that comes to his Maker in the integrity of his Heart, though ſin adhere as cloſe to that Heart of his, as his Skin doth to his Fleſh, ſhall find that imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will make thoſe Luſts, that were moſt dear unto him, by degrees to become ſtrange and looſe unto his Soul.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. But there is not only an active and natural ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy in the Duty it ſelf; but, which is more, when a Man draws near to God, God draws near to him, <hi>James</hi> 4.8. As the Grace and Spirit of God,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:50435:182"/>
that ſets thy Heart to Prayer, gives out more of his ſtrength and Grace unto thee when thou haſt prayed. Thus the Goodneſs of the infinite and eternal God moves in a Circle to the Soul, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9. <hi>My Grace is ſufficient for thee.</hi> There is not only a ſtrength gotten againſt our Corruptions by our Approxima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to him, but an Emanation of Virtue, Power, and Spirit from him, whereby to maſter and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume them: <hi>How much more will your heavenly Father give your Spirit to them that ask it,</hi> Luke 11.13. <hi>

                        <p n="1">1. For the firſt, our watching concerning <hi>God:</hi> 1. Watch for <hi>the Coming of thy Saviour,</hi> either in the general, or thy own particular Judgement: <hi>for ye know not when the maſter of the houſe comes, leſt coming ſuddenly, he find thee ſleeping,</hi> Mark 13.35.

This Light will ſhew thee the mind of thy Creator; it will inſtruct thee what to do in points of difficulty and danger; it will ſhew thee thy ſelf, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution and temper of thy Soul, and how the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt matter of concernment to thee in the World ſtands, even the condition of thy own Soul with God; it will interpret and unriddle unto thee thoſe various Diſpenſations and Adminiſtrations of things in the World; it hath Principles of ſo high and

It is true, the moſt exact walking may not only find, but occaſion Croſſes and Afflictions in our way; but moſt commonly, if not always, ſuch are accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with ſuch a meaſure of Comfort, and Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in them or with them, that I cannot call them Uncomfortable Paſſages, but rather Objects of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing. But when there comes an Affliction with a Sting in it, though but a ſmall one, ſuch a one as ſprings from my own folly, or a diſappointment, or interruption in a juſtifiable action, wherein I ſee, as it were, the hand of God hedging up my way, or the like, let me look but a little backward, I ſhall ſee the ſpring of it. As I will therefore keep a watch over my ways, that I incur not the danger of God's deſerting me, though in an action, it may
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:50435:184"/>
be, of no great conſequence; ſo when I find ſuch a Croſs, I will look backward, and ſearch, and try my ways, and when I have found my <hi>Achan,</hi> I will weep over him; I will look forward, and be more careful in my future Converſation; I will look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and bleſs the merciful hand of God, that is pleaſed to take ſuch care over a poor Creature, as to ſend his Meſſenger, though, it may be, a rough and ſower one, to reclaim me from the danger of a greater Evil.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Watch the ſecret perſwaſions and diſſwaſions of <hi>the Spirit of God,</hi> and beware thou quench it not, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.19. nor grieve it, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.30. A Man that obſerves his ways, ſhall oftentimes hear a ſecret Voice from his Conſcience, conformable to the Word of God, calling to him: <hi>Do not this abominable thing, which I hate,</hi> Jer. 44.4. or, <hi>This is the way, walk in it,</hi> Iſa. 30.21. Be ſure thou obſerve this Voice; try it with the Word, the Rule of Truth; and beware thou neglect it not. This Wind, that blows where it liſts, if ſhut out, reſiſted, or grieved, may haply never breathe upon thee again, but leave thee to be hardened in thy ſins: But if obſerved, tried, and obeyed, thou ſhalt be ſure to have it thy Monitor and Director upon all occaſions.</p>

                        <p n="2">2. FOR the ſecond Object of our Watch, <hi>our Selves:</hi> ſuch is the diſtemper and diſorder of our Souls ſince the Fall, that though it meets with no temptations from without, yet it will make them; and, like a diſtempered Stomach, the Luſts that are within us, will turn that into our Poiſon, which is of it ſelf either wholeſom, or at leaſt indifferent: The Wedge of Gold, and the Babyloniſh Garment, had in it ſelf naturally no temptation to Evil; but Luſt joyns with it, conceives upon it, and brings forth Sin: the Rock ſtands ſtill, ſtrikes not the Ship, but the Ship ſtrikes the Rock, and ſplits it ſelf. The greateſt part of that ſin, that is in us, is not ſo much due to the influence and motion of Objects upon us, as to the Corruption that the Object meets with in us: therefore it concerns us to have a ſtrict and continual Watch upon our ſelves: And herein.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Watch thy <hi>Senſes:</hi> watch thine <hi>Eye;</hi> thine Eye is a wanton Eye, an Eye full of Adultery, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.14. <hi>David,</hi> a Man after God's own Heart, wanted his watch upon his Eye, and he ſaw, and luſted, and ſinned, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.2. With <hi>Job</hi> therefore, ſee that thou keep thine Eye under a Covenant, <hi>Job</hi> 31.1. Thine Eye is a luxurious Eye; the Fruit was pleaſant to the Eye, and our firſt Mother, though to the ruine of her Poſterity, did let in the beauty of the Fruit, and together with it, Sin, and
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:50435:185"/>
Death, through her Eye, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.6. Thine Eye is an unſatiable Eye, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 1.8. a covetous Eye, <hi>Joſhua</hi> 7.21. <hi>I ſaw, and I coveted:</hi> a lofty and proud Eye, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.14. a flattering and a deceitful Eye, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.12. a cruel and an oppreſſing Eye, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.8. <hi>His Eyes are privily ſet againſt the Poor:</hi> an evil Eye. Let it therefore be thy Practice, as well as thy Prayer, to turn away thine Eye from beholding Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.37. and to have thine Eyes always towards God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 141.8.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Set a Guard upon <hi>thy Ear,</hi> and take heed how, and what thou heareſt, <hi>Mark</hi> 4.24. Thou haſt a wandering Eye, an <hi>Athenian</hi> Ear, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.21. an itching Ear, that will not endure ſound Truth, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.3. a deaf and ſtopped Ear, when thou ſhouldeſt hear, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 6.10. an open and unſatiable Ear after Vanity and Unprofitableneſs, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 1.8.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Set a Watch over <hi>thy Tongue,</hi> and keep the door of thy Lips, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 141.3. and take heed thou ſin not with thy Tongue, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.1. Remember an account is to be given for an idle word, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.36. ſeaſon thy words with Salt, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 4.6. and that will take away the filthineſs of thy Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.8. Remember that thy Tongue is ſet on fire of Hell, <hi>James</hi> 3.6. Watch therefore thy Tongue: let thy words be few, ſeaſonable, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate, true.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Set a Watch upon <hi>thine Appetite:</hi> it is of it ſelf natural, and conſequently good; but the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper of our Nature hath put it out of its place, and conſequently out of its bounds. Suſpect thy Appetite, and keep it under with Rules of Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: put a Knife to thy Throat, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.2. look not upon the Wine, when it gives its colour in the

                        <p n="5">5. SET a Watch upon <hi>thine Affections and Paſſions:</hi> Thy Affections are by thy natural corruption, become inordinate Affections; they are eaſily miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed, and more eaſily over-acted. Take heed <hi>to thy Love:</hi> according to the order or diſorder of this Affection, are all thy other Affections tempered: See therefore that it be rightly placed: Diſpence thy Love in meaſures proportionable to the worth of the Object: Nothing can challenge thy intenſeſt Love, but the intenſeſt Good; and that God that requires thy Heart, is a jealous God: let not out the whole Current of thy Affections upon any thing below him: Lawful Pleaſures, natural Relations, Conveniences in the World, a Man's own ſelf, may be Objects of a moderate and ſubordinate Love: But when they take up the whole compaſs of our Love, our Love becomes our Sin, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.37. <hi>He that loveth father or mother more than me, is not worthy of me,</hi> 1 John 2.15. <hi>If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.</hi> 2 Tim. 3.2, 4. lovers of themſelves, and lovers of Pleaſures, ranked amongſt the worſt of Men. When the Affection of thy Soul is moving after any thing, before thou give it leave, examine the Object, whether worthy of any meaſure of thy Love; and if ſo, yet let it not go without a farther debate: Conſider the meaſure of Good, that is in the Object, and weigh out its proportion of Love
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:50435:187"/>
anſwerable to the meaſure of its Good: But reſt not there neither, remember it is but a ſubordinate, a derivative Good, as well as a meaſurable Good: beſtow not that meaſure of thy Love upon it abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, but ſubordinately: catechiſe thy Love with this Queſtion, Whether if thy Creator requires thee to hate that Object, to forgo it, to forſake it, thou canſt be better content to call home thy Affection, than to let it reſt where it is? By this time, and by this means, thy Love will be under a diſcipline and a rule, and the Precipitancy of this Affection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond its due Proportion allayed and moderated. And remember always, it is the impotency of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and the great cauſe of the diſorders in our Souls and Lives, that we are contented to give our Affections leave, upon the firſt apprehenſion, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue their Objects without debate, leſt we ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt the expectation of Contentment, by a clear diſcovery of the unworthineſs and vanity of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and the ill conſequences of immoderation in the purſuit: thus we are contented to deceive our ſelves with the Felicity of falſe Expectation, rather than by pre-conſideration to avoid a real Inconvenience or Diſappointment.</p>
                        <p>Take heed to <hi>thine Anger.</hi> Be angry, but ſin not, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.26 keep it not too long; nor act it too far, leſt it prove Hatred, Revenge, Oppreſſion: Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thy Anger ſo, that it may be rather an act of thy Judgment, than of thy Perturbation: If thou art pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked by an Injury, before thou give a Commiſſion to this Paſſion, propoſe to thy ſelf the Queſtion which God asked <hi>Jonah,</hi> Jonah 4.9. <hi>Doſt thou well to he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry?</hi> weigh well the Cauſe, and remember thou art partial to thy ſelf, and apt to conſtrue that for a juſt Provocation, which it may be was none, or deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Suſpect thy Judgment of Partiality; put thy
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:50435:187"/>
ſelf in the others Condition before thou judgeſt; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that he that doth thee the Injury, is but God's Inſtrument, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16 10. <hi>Becauſe the Lord hath ſaid unto him, Curſe David, who then ſhall ſay, Wherefore haſt thou done ſo?</hi> It may be his Injury is God's Juſtice, and then thy Anger againſt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument is Rebellion; or at beſt, it may be his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment of thy Patience, and then thy Anger is Diſobedience. Remember the juſt occaſions of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger thou haſt given to thy Creator, and yet his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to thee: <hi>and ſhouldeſt thou not have compaſſion on thy fellow ſervant?</hi> Matth. 18.33. Remember thy Redeemer, that bought thee with the Sacrifice of his Soul, hath given thee another Precept, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.44. Love your Enemies; and another Example, who when he was reviled, reviled not again: and canſt thou deny the denial of Paſſion for his ſake? Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thy gentleneſs will more advantage thee than thy anger: it may be, he will be conquered with thy Patience, and revenge thy Quarrel againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, with his Repentance; but if not, there is a God of Vengeance can, and will do it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.19. When a Man takes up the Office of his Judge, he injures both the Judge and Party, and in ſtead of doing himſelf right, he makes himſelf guilty. Again, if thou doeſt well to be angry, doſt thou well to be angry ſo much, or ſo long? The Wiſe Man tells us, That Anger reſteth in the boſom of Fools. Set a Watch therefore over thy Anger; let it be juſt, and moderate; and let not the Sun go down on thy wrath, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.26.</p>
                        <p>Set a Watch upon thy <hi>Fear:</hi> There is nothing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves thy fear of Reverence, but thy Creator; n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But if their Commiſſion extend to thy very Life, yet the Son of God hath taken away that ſting, that terror, that is in Death; hath by his own Death ſanctified Death unto thee, and made it a door un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a better Life; ſo that Death, though in it ſelf terrible and bitter, yet this Tree being himſelf caſt into this bitter Water, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.25. hath ſweetned them; and as he hath taken away the Venome of it, by deſtroying that Serpent, that had the power of it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. ſo he hath made it, though not for it ſelf, yet in reſpect of him, that ſtands on the other ſide of this Gulf, with Immortality and Glory in his hand, deſirable, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.23. <hi>Having a deſire to depart, and to be with Chriſt, which is far better:</hi> It is true, thou art purſued with an Army of <hi>Egyptians,</hi> of Sins, and of Miſeries, and when thou comeſt to the Shore, thou ſeeſt a raging and a bloody Sea; But remember thou haſt an Angel, even the Angel of the Covenant, that hath gone before, and yet goes with thee, and turns this Sea into a Paſſage of Eaſe and Safety: and though of either ſide the Waves may affright thy Senſe, they ſhall not hurt thee: and remember, that though thy Paſſage may be difficult and troubleſome, yet thou haſt not, as once the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> a Wilderneſs behind it, but a <hi>Canaan.</hi> Therefore in all Objects or Occurrences
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:50435:188"/>
of Terror, firſt look inward, and ſee how the caſe ſtands between thy God and thy Conſcience: indeed if there remain a Guilt unwaſhed by the Blood of Chriſt, a ſecret ſin entertained, and not repented of, thou haſt cauſe to fear, becauſe thy Lord is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry: But if thou keep thy daily Watch upon thy Soul and thy Life, if thou find the preſence of thy Saviour in thy Soul, and thy Heart, though of it ſelf a ſinful Heart, yet cleanſed and delivered from the power of any evil way, an honeſt Heart, acted by the love of God in Chriſt, thou mayeſt then look above them; and, having thine Eye fixed upon the Lord of Events, walk quietly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troubled through the midſt of thoſe dangers, that do incompaſs thee. It is true, that in the great Concuſſions of the World, God expects a ſuitable affection, even from the moſt innocent Heart, an affection of Reverence, and awe of his Preſence and working, <hi>Jeremiah</hi> 10.7. <hi>Who would not fear thee, O king of nations?</hi> But the fear of an honeſt Heart is the fear of Reverence, not of Conſternation, a Fear mingled with Love, a Fear mingled with Faith and confidence, a Fear mingled with Praiſe and Glorifying God; a Fear terminated in the great Lord, that works not in the Inſtrument, not in the immediate Object of Terror; a Fear mingled with Comfort, not over-run with diſtraction. When therefore thou meeteſt with Objects of Fear, firſt learn to diſtinguiſh their kinds: ſome there are that come as it were, from the immediate hand of God; ſuch are Famine, Peſtilence, Wars, Fires, Inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Earthquakes and the like; entertain them with Reverence to the great, and Juſt, and Powerful hand of God, not ſlightly, or ſaucily, or preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuouſly, yet without conſternation or diſtraction of Mind; carry up thy Soul above the Objects, to the
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:50435:189"/>
Hand that guides them; make him thy Dependance, and his Will the meaſure of thine own under them; uſe all warrantable means with Dependance upon his Power, and Submiſſion to his Will, to avoid them: The wiſe Man ſeeth the Plague, and hideth himſelf, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.3. <hi>Prov.</hi> 27.12. If thou eſcape the danger, bleſs the God that hath preſerved thee; if thou fall in them, yet ſtill bleſs the God, that hath not left thee; and value ten thouſand Deaths with his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and Light upon thy Soul above the moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limated Life without it: Again, there are ſome Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Fear, which, though they are guided and maſtered by the hand of God, yet they are imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately the works of Men, and ſo leſs terrible; ſuch are wrought by the power, oppreſſion, cruelty, and malice of Men; theſe may and ought to be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with more reſolution and confidence: That one Example may ſerve for all, when the power and injuſtice of Man ſhall meet with an unarmed and weak innocence, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.16. <hi>O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to anſwer thee in this matter; our God, whom we ſerve, is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king: But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, we will not ſerve thy Gods:</hi> As if they ſhould have ſaid:
<q>It is true, thou art a King, and where the word of a King is, there is Power; and to magnifie thy ſelf and thy Glory, in the face of thy Kingdom, thou haſt taken up this publick Reſolution of the Dedication of thine Idol; and this thy Purpoſe is ſtabliſhed by a Decree, a Miſchief framed by a Law, and this Decree armed with Death, and a cruel and terrible Death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we know we croſs thy proud and impious Will, impatient of the ſeeming neglect of thy Power, by three poor deſpiſed <hi>Hebrews</hi> in the midſt of thy Glory and People; we ſee fury and rage enough in

thy countenance, to devour us before the Furnace be hot; we ſee thy Courtiers adding fewel to thy rage, and thy Inſtruments greedily catching after the leaſt Warrant from thee, for our Execution; and we are compaſſed with Fleſh and Blood, which cannot but ſhrink at the preapprehenſion of this inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and terrible diſſolution: yet for all this, know that we have learned to tutor our Fear; not to fear a Man that ſhall die, and the Son of Man, that ſhall be made as Graſs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51.11. we have learned, that the fear of Man bringeth a ſnare, but he that truſteth in the Lord ſhall be ſafe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.25. And therefore we are not much perplexed, what Anſwer to return to theſe thy Commands and Threats; we ſerve that God, in whoſe hand thou art, as the Ax or the Saw in his hand that ſhaketh it; in whoſe hand thy Breath is, and he can command away thy Breath, and then what becomes of thy Word? that Lord, in whoſe hand thy Heart is, and he can turn it as the River of Water, and can ſet thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand againſt thy Decree; that God, in whoſe hands are the iſſues of death, and who can arm an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable Occurrence to divert and fruſtrate thy Purpoſe; in whoſe hands are all the Powers of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, and can correct and controll that Fire which thou intendeſt for the execution of thy Fury: And this is the God whom we ſerve, and hath made a Covenant with us to preſerve us in the Fire; and we are no leſs confident of his Love, and of his Truth, than of his Wiſdom and Power to deliver us; he hath taught us, that he is a preſent help in trouble, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 46.1. that if we call upon him in the day of trouble, he will deliver us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.15. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 91.15. that in the Fire he will be with us, and in the Water, and it ſhall not come near us: Therefore, O King, we value not thy Power, nor
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:50435:190"/>
thy Rage, for our Dependance is above them: But this is not all: If that great God, whom we ſerve, deliver us over to the ſwing of thy Rage, we have learnt yet a higher Leſſon, our Faith and Experience hath taught us to truſt in him; and our Love hath taught us to obey him: though he ſeem to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint our truſt by delivering us unto thy Fury, yet we will not forget to obey him: he hath taught us to make his Will, the meaſure and rule of ours, both in what we ſuffer, and in what we do: we owe our Lives to him, and thou art but his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to take them from us; when his Will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands our Lives, we ſhall reſign them with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience; but now his Glory requires them, we will give them up with Chearfulneſs: If we cannot live, but upon ſo dear a rate, as to offend our bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful God, farewell Life with Guilt, and welcome Death with Innocence. Know, O King, that the Preſence and Love of our God hath taught us how to fear to offend, yet to dare to die.</q>

Yet ſuch is the Atheiſm, the Pride, and Folly of our Hearts, that it will place its confidence in any thing, rather than where it ſhould. The diſtemper of this, as of all other our Affections, hath its begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the Blindneſs of our Judgments, the want of a deep and practical knowledge of God; and from hence our Confidences and Hopes, fix and reſt often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in moſt vain and deceitful Objects.

upon right Principles;</hi> otherwiſe thy Confidence may be thy Preſumption: Examine thy very Recumbence upon thy Creator: The immediate <hi>ground</hi> of any <hi>Confidence in God</hi> is a perſwaſion of his Power, and a perſwaſion of his Love, and in both theſe the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of our Nature doth diſcover it ſelf, and is fit to be conſidered:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Touching <hi>his Power</hi> the Errors of our Truſt on either hand in the Defect, and in the Exceſs.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Diffidence in his Power, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.19. <hi>Can God furniſh a table in the wilderneſs? therefore the Lord heard this and was wroth</hi> Upon any Extremity, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo black and inevitable, look upon the Power of God as able moſt eaſily to over-match it.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Reſting upon his Power, without conſulting with his Will: This is <hi>Preſumption,</hi> when a Man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Commiſſion from his Maker, ſhall entertain any deſperate attempt: This is for a vain Man to go about to ingage the Power of the great God againſt himſelf, his Will, his Purity, his Wiſdom, his Purpoſe. See thou haſt a Commiſſion from the Will of thy Creator for what thou art about; and if ſo, then caſt thy ſelf upon his Power: when thou art acting by his Command, doubt not but thou ſhalt act by his Power.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Touching <hi>his Love,</hi> this likewiſe yields Errors on both hands:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. In the <hi>defect,</hi> principally when a Soul, that doubts not of his Power, becauſe ſhe knows him; nor hath cauſe to doubt of his Love, becauſe her Peace is made; yet ſuch black ſtorms and pre-appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of dangers are gathered round about her, that ſhe cannot ſee the Love or Care of God towards her, <hi>Pſal</hi> 77.9. <hi>Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he ſhut up his tender mercies?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">
                           <pb n="346" facs="tcp:50435:192"/>2. In the <hi>Exceſs,</hi> an ungrounded <hi>Preſumption</hi> of the Love and Favour of God: and herein are <hi>divers Miſtakes:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. When a Man ſhall argue a perſonal and ſpecial Love of God unto him from <hi>External Succeſſes</hi> and Events. It is true, that the Mercy and Love of God is over all his Works; and the Happineſs of Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals is the fruit of the Love of God as to his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but not a ſufficient evidence of that ſpecial Love of God as to his Child; they are fruits of his Bounty, not always evidences of his Favour: Experience of former Mercies in external ſucceſſes and deliverances, may and ought to ſtrengthen that Confidence which is well grounded upon the Love of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.11. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.37. But they are not always infallible arguments of that Love: When Bleſſings in Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals make us more humble, more thankful, more watchful, then they may juſtly make us more confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, becauſe then the Love of God comes in with his Bleſſings: And then are External Bleſſings argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Love of God, when they teach the Soul, as well to love God, as to truſt in him.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. When a Man ſhall argue a perſonal and ſpecial Love of God by the preſence of <hi>External Priviledges,</hi> when there wants ſincere Obedience, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.4, 10. <hi>Truſt ye not in lying words, ſaying, The Temple of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. and therefore God ſends them to the Example of <hi>Shiloh.</hi> Ibid. <hi>Verſe</hi> 12. And the reaſon why this muſt needs be, as well a deceiving Inference, as diſpleaſing to God, is becauſe in truth, in ſuch a caſe, the Soul placeth her ultimate confidence in theſe things, and robs God of part of that Confidence which belongs unto him.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. When a Man ſhall argue the Love of God to him from his <hi>External Performances</hi> of thoſe things which God commanded, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.11. <hi>Amos</hi> 5.21. This
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:50435:192"/>
hath this double Error in it: 1. A groſsly miſtaken Apprehenſion of the Will of God, which is moſt juſt; as if the God that judgeth the Heart, and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures all the Actions of Men by their Hearts, ſhould be pleaſed with the Shell of Duties and Obedience: whereas the things that are ſo done, as they are in themſelves without the Heart, but indifferent Actions, and ſo cannot be pleaſing; ſo they are but hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and falſe, and muſt needs be diſpleaſing. 2. A ſharing of our Confidence between God and our ſelves, <hi>de quo infra.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. When a Man ſhall argue the Love of God <hi>as an Effect and Price of his Obedience and Sincerity</hi> towards him. The Error in this, is that in truth a Man makes himſelf his Confidence, for he that truſts in the Love of God, becauſe he thinks he hath purchaſed or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured the Love of God, doth in truth reſolve his Confidence into himſelf. Therefore look upon the beſt Dreſs of thy Soul, thy Humility, thy Faith, thy Love, thy Sincerity, thy Obedience, not as Cauſes of the Love of thy God, or the Price or Purchace of it, but as Effects and Evidences of his Love to thee: Look upon thy Sincerity, Love and Obedience to God, as the fruit and ſign of his Love; that will make thy God thy Confidence; not as the Purchace or Price of his Love; for that will make thy ſelf thy Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption: were they thy own, thou oweſt them and infinitely more to thy Creator, and therefore canſt not deſerve by them: But alas, they are not thine own; his Love, as it is the Motive of thine, ſo it is the Cauſe of it, and of all that can be acceptable to him.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. When a Man from well grounded Arguments of the Love of God <hi>to his Perſon,</hi> ſhall conclude the Favour of God <hi>to his Actions,</hi> without meaſuring of them by his Will. This was the Error of <hi>Joſiah</hi>'s
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:50435:193"/>
Confidence, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35.21, 22. he hearkened not to the words of <hi>Necho,</hi> from the mouth of God, and fell.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. When a Man who hath a ſound ground of the Love of God <hi>unto his Perſon,</hi> ſhall yet go along in any known or unrepented Sin. Such ſins by any, that hath entred into Covenant with God, have more Malignity and Preſumption in them, than the very ſame ſins committed by others, becauſe committed againſt more Light and againſt more Love: and the Merciful God is yet a Jealous God, and one that accepteth not Perſons, his ways are equal and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.25. If the beſt of Men walk contrary to him, it muſt of neceſſity be, that he walk con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to them: and therefore he hates with the ſame hatred a courſe of ſin, even in his ſubject, as well as in his enemy: And the ſame ſin that puts a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger unto God in the Condition of an Enemy, puts a Subject in the Condition of a Rebel: and therefore, though he will not utterly take his loving kindneſs from them, he will viſit their tranſgreſſion with the rod, and their ſins with ſtripes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.32. will hide his face from them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.18. a frequent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of God's withdrawing the Actual Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of his Love and Preſence, even from his own, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30.7. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74.9, 11. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.17. What ever be the Purpoſe of God concerning thee, be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of this, that ſo long as thou art in a courſe of ſin againſt him, though his Counſel concerning thee, be not thereby interrupted, yet till thy returning to him and repenting of thy ſin, the Actual Fruition of thy intereſt in him, is interrupted; thou art actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the ſame condition, if not a worſe, than before thy firſt Covenant with thy Creator, and haſt as little cauſe of Confidence in his Love now, as thou hadſt then. And as the Act of thy Love to God is
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:50435:193"/>
moſt apparently interrupted by this thy practice of a known ſin till thy return, ſo thou mayeſt moſt juſtly conclude an interruption of the Act of his Love to thee, till thou return, though that return of thine is the fruit of that Love, which was ſtill in him, though thou didſt go along in the frowardneſs of thy ways; when God hides himſelf by reaſon of ſin, thy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction thereby is to ſeek him out otherwiſe that which thou calleſt thy Confidence, may be thy Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, and may cauſe the Wrath and Jealouſie of thy Creator to ſmoke againſt thee, becauſe thou haſt bleſſed thy ſelf in thy Heart, ſaying, <hi>I ſhall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of my heart,</hi> Deut. 29.19. Every motion of the Heart to God, if it be right, is conformable to the Mind of God throughout. When thy Life is ſinful, and thy Heart not humble, ſuſpect thy Confidence to have more of thy Corruption, than of Grace in it.</p>
                        <p>Take heed to thy <hi>Joy.</hi> Regularly as is the object or meaſure of thy Love, ſuch is the object and meaſure of thy Joy: Joy is nothing elſe, but a reſult of the Soul in the fruition of what is loved: yet though thou hadſt a watch over thy Love before thou enjoyedſt, have a ſtricter watch over the temper of thy Spirit in thy fruition: Look to the object of thy Joy, thy evil Heart will rejoyce, will glory in thy ſin, in thy ſhame: unleſs thou haſt a watch upon thy Heart, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and miſchief will be thy Joy, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.23. <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.21. the fall of thine Enemy will be thy Joy, and the Lord will ſee, and it will diſpleaſe him, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.17. thou wilt make Exceſs, Impurity, Oppreſſion, Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Injuſtice, Pride, thy Joy and thy Delight: Thy Affections are blind, and mad, and muſt be led.

God hath bleſſed thee with a good Wife, which the wiſe Man calls the Crown of her Husband, <hi>Pro.</hi> 12.4. with a numerous and hopeful Iſſue, which the wiſe Man calls the Crown of Old Age, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.6. with a Good Name, which the wiſe Man calls a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Ointment, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.1. with a merry Heart, which doth good like a Medicine, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.22. with Honour and Promotion, Wealth, Wiſdom, Succeſs in thy Labours; and theſe ought to be entertained with rejoycing and comfort: the wiſe Man tells us, it is the Portion that God giveth thee in them, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 3.13, 22. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.18. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.9. and it is thy duty enjoyned thee by God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.27. <hi>Becauſe thou ſervedſt not the Lord thy God with joyfulneſs and with gladneſs of heart for the abundance of all things, therefore,</hi> &amp;c. But take heed to thy Heart, it will ſoon abuſe and exceed his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Look to the <hi>Manner</hi> of thy Joy or Mirth, that it be not light, or vain, thy Mirth may prove mad, <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ.</hi> 2.2. the Laughter of a Fool, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.6. a Mirth that will end in Heavineſs, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.13.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Look to the <hi>Meaſure</hi> of it. Firſt weigh the Good that thou enjoyeſt, and then weigh out a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of Joy anſwerable to the value of that Good: lay not out the whole ſtock of thy Joy for that which deſerves but a ſmall part of it. We are commonly miſtaken in the value we put upon the things we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect or enjoy, and that makes us miſ-ſpend our ſelves upon them: Be ſure nothing below the fruition of thy Creator, can deſerve the whole ſtock of thy Delight; and if thou diſpenſeſt it otherwiſe, thou robbeſt thy God, and deceiveſt thy ſelf. There are <hi>three Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations</hi> and <hi>Cautions,</hi> that are often to be uſed to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate our Delight in Externals:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. To conſider the true value of them: they are but limited Good, and not large enough for thy Soul:
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:50435:194"/>
limited in meaſure, limited in duration; the Good that is in them, is that Congruity that God hath put in them, and that only a limited good, and can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve but a limited Delight.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. To mingle thoſe ſad Conſiderations of Morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and an Account with the Fruition of any Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals. This doth allay the exorbitancy of the Heart, and keeps the Soul from ſurfeiting upon any outward Good: this is the going to the houſe of Mourning com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by the wiſe Man, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.2. that ſad remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance which he gives to the young man in the midſt of his jollity, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 11.9. <hi>But know that for all theſe things God will bring thee to judgment:</hi> there is a ſevere Eye, that beholdeth all thy deportment in the fruition of thoſe things I lend thee, that will have a ſad account for thy carriage in the uſe of them.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. To contemplate often the Goodneſs of God, his Mercy, his Bounty; to find the Preſence and Love of God in thy Love, the ſound hope of eternal Life: This will take up the whole compaſs of thy delight, and rejoycing, wherein thou canſt not exceed, ſo that thou wilt not have Joy enough, or at leaſt not too much, for any thing below him, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.20. <hi>In this rejoyce not, but rather rejoyce, becauſe your names are written in heaven.</hi> When this Sun ſhines in the Heart, thoſe little Stars of outward Comfort, which at no time have but a derivative Light, will not appear: And this thy Faith is the Victory that overcometh the World, the delights of the World, as well as the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of the World: It will keep Comforts and thy Delight in them in their due place and ſubordination, and count them but dung and loſs, that thou mayeſt win Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8. If the Lord ſhall lift up the light of his countenance upon thee, it will put more glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in thy Heart, than when their or thine own Corn and Wine increaſed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.7. When thy Peace is

made with God, thy Conſcience ſprinkled by the Blood of Chriſt, the Spirit, the Comforter, witneſſing with thy own Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. thy Heart ſincere towards God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. this will cauſe an abiding Joy, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.16. <hi>John</hi> 16.12. a full Joy, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.4. a victorious Joy, that like <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Serpent devours the falſe Joys, and conquers the temporal Sorrows of this Life; <hi>Acts</hi> 5.41. <hi>James</hi> 1.2. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.13. a Joy unſpeakable and full of Glory, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. And as to the manner and meaſure of thy De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, ſo look <hi>to the Ground, the formal Reaſon</hi> of thy Delight: ſee that thy delight or rejoycing fix not in thoſe external Comforts ſingly; for then thy Delight will be ſenſual, immoderate, and vain, the very ſame that an irrational Creature takes in them, <hi>viz.</hi> a complacency in the fruition of that, which is conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient and ſuitable to his Senſe: But look upon thy Bleſſings, and delight in them, as thou ſeeſt the Bounty, the Goodneſs, the Hand, the Promiſe, the Truth of God in them: This will not only moderate, but ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualize thy delight in them: thy delight in them will not only be Comfortable to thy ſelf, but Acceptable to God: thy delight in thy Bleſſings is then mingled with Thankfulneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with Humility, with Sobriety, with Faith, with Watchfulneſs; it is thy Duty, and it is thy Safety. The rich Man in the Goſpel, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.19. <hi>Soul, thou haſt much goods laid up for many years, eat, drink, and be merry:</hi> and this was his ſin: The <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelite</hi> offering his firſt Fruits to God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 26.11. is commanded to <hi>rejoyce in every good thing which the Lord thy God hath given unto thee:</hi> this was his Duty: the rejoycing the ſame: here was the odds, the former terminated and laid out his Joy in the thing, as the ſuitable Good to his Nature and Condition; the latter looked upon it, and rejoyced in it, as a Gift of God: learn therefore to find God in the Creature,
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:50435:195"/>
and that will heal the Creature, and make it uſeful and ſafe; thou mayeſt then delight in them ſafely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou wilt then do it warrantably.</p>

                        <p>TAKE heed to thy <hi>Grief.</hi> Love, as is before no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, is the great Cardinal Affection or Motion of the Soul; and the other Affections are but Love diverſified according to the ſite or poſition of the Object: Love in the expectation of its Object, is Hope; in the doubt or danger of it, Fear; in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of it, Joy; in the abſence of it, Grief or Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. The Object therefore of thy Love is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of thy Grief, and the meaſure of thy Love to it, is the meaſure of thy Grief for it: Firſt therefore, ſee that thy intenſeſt Grief be relative to him that ought to be the Object of thy intenſeſt Love. Now our Love to God is under a double Conſideration: 1. Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, as he is the chiefeſt, perfect, abſolute Good. And under this Conſideration our Love ends in him: we love him for his own ſake. And this is an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Love, and a pure ſublime Love; and the Fruit of this Love, is an endeavour of Conformity to his Nature and to his Will. 2. Relatively, as he is the Chiefeſt Good to us. And this creates in us a double Love to him:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. A Love of Gratitude, a return of Love to him, becauſe we receive Love from him, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.19 <hi>We love him, becauſe he firſt loved us:</hi> this even na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ingenuity would challenge of us.</p>
                        <p n="2">
                           <pb n="354" facs="tcp:50435:196"/>2. A Love of Prudence, as I may call it, which is the only tolerable Self-Love in the World, to love God, becauſe the fruition of his Favour and his Preſence is our beſt Advantage, as a moſt ſuitable Good.</p>
                        <p>By this thou mayeſt eaſily find what ſhould be <hi>the Object</hi> of thy intenſeſt Grief, <hi>Sin, in others,</hi> Pſal. 119.136. <hi>Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, becauſe they keep not thy Law:</hi> But eſpecially Sin <hi>in our ſelves;</hi> that, and only that, can deſerve our intenſeſt Sorrow, as the only thing that is contrary,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. To the Purity, the Glory, the Will of him that is the chiefeſt Good. Is he the chiefeſt Good? then certainly, whatſoever is contrary to his Purity, Glory, or Will, cannot chuſe but be the chiefeſt Evil, and conſequently, the object of thy Hatred, and of thy Grief. Is thy Conformity to his Nature and Will, the neceſſary conſequence of thy Love unto him? that then that ſpoils that Conformity to him, cannot chuſe but be thy Sorrow: thou loveſt him, becauſe he is Good, and that Goodneſs in him, which is the cauſe of thy Love, muſt of neceſſity imprint upon thee a deſire to have the like ground of Lovelineſs in thy ſelf, and this thy ſin diſappoints thee of.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Contrary to that Gratitude, that even natural ingenuity teacheth thee to return to an ordinary Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor. Conſider, that great God, whom thou haſt offended, hath freely given thee thy Being, the greateſt Gift that is poſſibly conceiveable: and with thy Being, hath given thee the Copy of his Mind and Will, a moſt Reaſonable and Juſt Command, in the Obedience whereof, conſiſts thy Perfection and Happineſs: If he had given thee a rigorous and ſevere Law, taking in the whole compaſs of thy Being, or ſuch a Law wherein thou couldſt bave
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:50435:196"/>
ſeen nothing but the Abſolute Will of thy Creator; yet the Debt thou oweſt thy Creator, could not be ſatisfied with ſuch a performance: And now for thee to offend ſuch a Law of ſuch a God, that hath given thee thy Being! Again, conſider that when thy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker could not by any imaginable Rule of Juſtice owe any thing to the exacteſt Obedience of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet ſuch was his Goodneſs, that he made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Debtor even to his own Creature, entring into a Covenant of Life with him, thereby to encourage his Obedience; and this for no other cauſe, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his Mercy endureth for ever: For <hi>can a man be profitable to God?</hi> Job 22.2. And for a Man to ſin againſt ſo much Condeſcenſion of an Infinite God to his own Creature! Again conſider, when againſt ſo much Mercy and Love thou haſt offended thy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, and even by thy own Contract, as well as by the Juſt and Univerſal Right that God had over his Creature, haſt forfeited thy Being to thy Creator, yet he took not the advantage of it, remitted thy Forfeiture, and ſent a Sacrifice in thy ſtead, of his own providing, with a meſſage of a fulneſs of Love, with a new Covenant of more eaſineſs to perform, and of more comfort in the performance; with a Pardon for thy Sin, and with a Reward for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Righteouſneſs; and, when thou wert an enemy, and dead in ſins and treſpaſſes ſent his Son to his Creature, to beſeech Reconciliation, and his Spirit, to give thee Life to accept it, and to ſeal thy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation of it with an earneſt and an aſſurance of Life and Glory; that by that Spirit, and through that Son of his, hath given thee Acceſs unto his own Majeſty, a diſcovery of that Glory, to the which thou art called: Certainly, theſe are the higheſt ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Gratitude, that are poſſible to be put upon a Creature, and do therefore challenge even from
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:50435:197"/>
natural ingenuity, the higheſt Return thou canſt make, though it be infinitely ſhort of what thou doeſt owe: And yet after all this, croſs the Will of thy Creator, that hath done ſo much for thee! to forget the Love of thy Saviour, and to crucifie him again! to grieve that Spirit of Love and Purity, that comes to cleanſe thee, and fit thee for thy Maſters uſe, and to ſeal thee to Life and Immortality! to diſhonour that Name, by which thou art called! to pollute that Conſcience, which thy Saviour hath waſhed with his Bloud! to deface that Image and Superſcription of thy Creator, which he was imprinting upon thy Soul! to prefer a baſe, unworthy periſhing, unprofitable Luſt, or Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, before the Honour of ſuch a God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Love of ſuch a Saviour, the perſwaſion and importunities of ſuch a Spirit, before thy own Peace, Perfection, and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs! to vex, and oppreſs, and deſpiſe the Patience and Bounty of him, that hath done all this for thee, and gives thee yet an hour of Life to conſider of it, and a Promiſe of Grace and Pardon after all this, if thou canſt but mourn over thy Sins, thy unthankfulneſs, thy unworthy and diſingenuous dealing with thy God. Lay the weight of theſe and the like aggravations upon thy hard and ſtony Heart, and bruiſe it into Tears of Blood for thy unkindneſs to ſo merciful a God. Thou canſt not exceed in this Sorrow; it is a Sorrow that ſprings from the Love of God in the Soul; a Sorrow that will cleanſe thy Soul, a Sorrow that will bring thee to thy Maker, a Sorrow that hath a Promiſe of Acceptation goes along with it, a Sorrow that is mingled with Comfort, even the preſence of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and a Sorrow that ſhall end in a fulneſs of Joy. Sorrow for ſin, as for a neceſſary cauſe of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, may end in deſperation, becauſe it ariſeth from love of our ſelves: but ſorrow for ſin, as for an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unthankful return of ſo much Love from God, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not;
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:50435:197"/>
becauſe the Love of God is under that Sorrow, and the ſpring of thoſe Tears, is a ſpring of Life and Comfort.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Contrary to <hi>that Good which we loſe</hi> by it:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Our <hi>Conformity</hi> to the Mind and Will of God, is our Perfection; and the nearer our Conformity comes to his Will, the more perfect is our Being. Sin, which is a violation of that Will of his, ſpoils and diſorders this Conformity; and ſo it interrupts that inherent Good, which otherwiſe would be in us.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. As it deſtroys our Conformity to the Will of God, and ſo ſpoils us of our inherent Good, ſo it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupts that <hi>

                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>ommunicative Good,</hi> that Influence of <hi>Life and Comfort,</hi> which we have from God: It removes us to a greater diſtance from him; it diſplaceth us from that Poſition, in which, and by which, the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God ſhould be derived and conveyed to us: we are by it out of that Covenant, that Promiſe, which God hath made with his Creature: we are by it without the comfortable Preſence of God; without that Confidence, that we might otherwiſe have in him; out of the Aſſurance of his Providence and Protection: It makes our Souls in the midſt of all Fruition of outward Bleſſings, full of doubtful Anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Fears, and Uncertainties; in the midſt of any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Trouble without a Refuge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo full of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair: As we cannot have Confidence to go to our offended God by our Prayers, ſo it makes him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw and hide himſelf from them: a continual diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſs and heavineſs of Spirit, mingles and winds it ſelf into all our thoughts, even in our purſuits of diverſions from it: the ſame aſpect, that is between God and us, is between our own Conſcience and us: The Light of his Countenance is able to give Life and Comfort, and Serenity to the Soul in the midſt of all the Loſſes and Pains, and Deaths in the World;
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:50435:198"/>
and the want of that Light, makes the moſt happy external Condition to be dark and diſconſolate. And all this Good I loſe by a tranſient, unprofitable Sin; a Sin that I might have avoided, and therefore a Loſs that I might have avoided, a Loſs that comes not to me by my neceſſity, but by my fooliſh choice. I will therefore ſit down and mourn in ſecret, for that Comfort and Light, that I have thus fooliſhly ſinned away, and meaſure out my ſorrows and tears proportionable in ſome degree to that Loſs I have ſuſtained. The time was, when it pleaſed the great God, to let his Preſence and the Light of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance to ſhine into my Soul; and when I could with Comfort and Confidence upon any occaſion go to him and preſent my wants, my deſires, my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgements unto him; and he that ſits in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven was pleaſed to accept and entertain them at the hands of his Creature: But now that Influence of his, hath met with a filthy and backſliding Heart, and is weary of it, and hath withdrawn it ſelf, as juſtly it may; and my Prayers are laden with my Guilt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and cannot get up to him; and he hides himſelf. I have regarded Iniquity in my Heart, and, as he hath ſaid, ſo I find, he will not hear my Prayers. But though he will not hear my Prayers, yet he will not neglect my Tears. <hi>A broken and contrite heart, O Lord, thou wilt not deſpiſe.</hi> O Lord, though I have thus trifled away my Peace, and my Comfort, and have deſtroyed my ſelf, yet in thee is my help. As I will not reſt in my Sin, ſo neither will I reſt in my Grief, but will never give my ſelf, nor thee reſt, till thou haſt been pleaſed, in the Blood of thy Son, to waſh away my Guilt, and reſtore unto me thy Preſence and Peace again. And when I have recovered this Loſs, I will, by the aſſiſtance of that good Spirit of thine, learn by this my ſin, to revenge my ſelf upon my ſin; to
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:50435:198"/>
value the Mercy and Goodneſs of my Creator, that hath yet once more intruſted into my hands the Life and Comfort, which I had ſo lately loſt; to value the neceſſity, as well as the Love of my Saviour, that hath been pleaſed by a reapplication of his own Blood, to waſh me again after my late Relapſe; to value the kindneſs of the Pure and Bleſſed Spirit, that, though by my ſin I made him weary, and forſake that polluted chamber of my Heart, yet is pleaſed to return and cleanſe, and take up again that Room, from which I had ſo unworthily excluded him: I will learn to priſe that Peace and Comfort, which once I had, and valued not, but loſt it for an unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable periſhing Sin: I will ſtrive to ſence my Heart with renewed Covenants and Reſolutions of more watchfulneſs over my ſelf, that I return not again to Folly: I will ſit down and bleſs the Mercy, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Patience, Bounty of God, that hath not left me in that Condition, which I could neither endure nor remove; and ſtudy to return a Heart and Life in ſome meaſure anſwerable to ſo great Love and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And when I have done all, O Lord Jeſus, let that Eternal Covenant between thee and the Father, that thou ſhouldeſt give Eternal Life to as many as he hath given thee, <hi>John</hi> 17.2. that Power and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of thine, that none ſhall pluck me out of thy hands, <hi>John</hi> 10.28. that Union with thee, that thou art pleaſed to give to as many as believe on thee, <hi>John</hi> 15.4, 5. that Spirit of thine, which by that Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with thee conveys Life and Influence to the ſmalleſt branch in thee, preſerve and ſupport me in all my Purpoſes and Reſolutions, in all my Frailties and Temptations: For without thee I can do nothing.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. In reference to <hi>outward Objects</hi> and occaſions of Sorrow, as loſs of Friends, Wealth, Reputation, Health, Life it ſelf, have a guard upon this Paſſion:</p>
                        <p n="1">
                           <pb n="360" facs="tcp:50435:199"/>1. Look upon them as the Fruits and Effects of thy Sin, and ſo let them carry thy Grief beyond the immediate object to the meritorious cauſe of them. This is the ſting of all Affliction; the Plague in thy Heart is the Core and Fountain of the Plague of thy Externals. And when thou haſt humbled thy Soul before thy Creator, and gotten the Blood of thy Saviour to waſh thy Conſcience, thy Affliction ſhall be removed, or thy Soul enabled with chearfulneſs and comfort to bear it.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Labour to find out the Voice of the Rod, the Mind of thy Creator, for, if thou diligently obſerve it, there is not a diſpenſation of Divine Providence, but it brings a meſſage with it to thy Soul. Look into thy Heart, it may be there is an accurſed thing in the midſt of thee, <hi>Joſhua</hi> 7.13. and this Affliction bids thee be up and removing it: It may be thy Heart was leaning too much upon that very Bleſſing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thou findeſt thy Croſs or Affliction, which robbed thy Maker of ſome of the Love and Duty thou oweſt to him: It may be, thy Heart was grown dead and careleſs in thy applications to thy Creator, ſecure and reſting in thy temporal Enjoyment, and he hath ſent his Meſſenger to awake thee: It may be, thou haſt had a dull and heavy Ear, that would not liſten, or could not perceive God ſpeaking once, yea twice unto thee in a ſtill voice, <hi>Job</hi> 33.14. and now he hath ſent an inſtruction with a louder voice: It may be, thou beganneſt too much to ſet up thy reſt here, to place thy Confidence in the things of this World, to be overtaken with the delight in them, to over<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="361" facs="tcp:50435:199"/>
fall upon, and hurt thee, but cannot ſecure thee; to make the look upward; to quicken thy Life of Faith by ſhaking thy Life of Senſe: It may be, thou wert growing preſumptuous in the Goodneſs of God, Saucy in thy Carriage towards him, inſolent towards him, opinionative of thy ſelf: And he hath ſent this ſearching Medicine to fallow and purge theſe diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly and dangerous Humours: But g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But yet for all this, know thy Affliction hath a Voice ſtill: if it look not backward, yet it looks forward; if it be not a Medicine to cure thee, yet it may be an Antidote to preſerve thee, a Cordial to ſtrengthen thee: it bids thee improve thy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, thy Faith, thy Dependance upon God, thy Experience of his Preſence, thy earneſtneſs in Prayer, thy neglect of the World, thy Denyal of thy ſelf. Learn therefore, before thou poureſt out thy ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row upon any Affliction, to examine thy Heart, to ſearch out the meaning of God in it: it will regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late thy Grief, and inſtruct thy mind both how to bear it, and how to uſe it.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Beware thou put not on a Reſolution not to be grieved or troubled at all upon any occaſion of Grief. The putting on of ſuch a Stoical Reſolution is to arm a Mans ſelf againſt God, to harden the Heart not to receive Correction; and, as much as in a Man is, to diſappoint the purpoſe of God: He, that put theſe Paſſions in the Heart of Man, now

ſends this Meſſenger to ſtir up this Paſſion, though thereby he intends a farther End: And for a Man to fence his Soul againſt any object of Sorrow, ſo as not to be moved thereby, ſhall be ſure to find either an abſolute Ruine, or that God will ſo plant his Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries againſt that Reſolution, that at length he will maſter him, and melt his Soul into a more pliable Diſpoſition.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. When God ſends an occaſion of Sorrow, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain it with an Affection anſwerable to the Object, both in kind and meaſure: Let thy Grief be an humble Grief, not mingled with murmuring or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content. If thou couldſt imagine, thou hadſt not deſerved it, yet remember who it is that inflicts it, even he that is abſolute Lord of his Creature, and owes him not his Being. When thou goeſt and treadeſt upon a Worm, or a Snail, thou doeſt an injury to thy fellow Creature, yet thou paſſeſt away and takeſt no notice of it: But thy Creator can owe thee nothing. Take up that incomparable Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and temper of Mind with old <hi>Eli,</hi> 1 Sam. 3.18. <hi>It is the Lord, let him do what ſeemeth him good.</hi> And this ſame Conſideration, as it will teach thee to mingle Humility with thy Grief, ſo it will teach thee Patience and Quietneſs in thy Sorrow, becauſe the occaſion comes from the hand of a moſt Juſt and Wiſe and Merciful God. Impatience under any Affliction, ariſeth from the termination of the motion of our Souls upon the immediate Object: he that knows, and fears, and loves his Creator, and ſees his hand diſpenſing the Afflictions, will learn Patience and Moderation, though he cannot forget Sorrow and Grief under it.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Let thy Grief be moderate in Extent, Meaſure, and Duration. Nothing but ſin and the diſpleaſure of God can deſerve thy intenſeſt Grief. Learn to put

a true value upon thy Loſs, and meaſure out Sorrow anſwerable to it. Conſider,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Thy <hi>Loſs</hi> is not of thy chiefeſt Good, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſerveth not thy intenſeſt Sorrow. Thy Peace with thy Creator, thy Everlaſting Hope, as long as they are ſafe, thou haſt enough left to over-weigh the greateſt Loſs thou canſt ſuffer: What are light Afflictions, and but for a Moment, when put in the Balance with an Eternal Weight of Glory?</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Conſider, thy Loſs is not of thy own Good. Cannot the Almighty lend thee a Bleſſing, but thou muſt call it thine, and deny the abſolute Lord of it, the Property of it? It is his Corn, and his Wine, and his Oyl: and all our Bleſſings are his; and as they are his, ſo they are taken away by him. Learn to make the Will of thy Lord, the meaſure of thine; and then though Nature teach thee to grieve, Grace will teach thee not to exceed in thy Grief.</p>

                        <p n="3">3.

<pb n="366" facs="tcp:50435:202"/>
towards it, and againſt all that is contrary to it: and by this means the Motions of thy Will will be certain, ſteddy, uniform, and regular: the inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thy Will to any thing elſe will be meaſured by this, and ſubordinate unto it: if the Good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded conſiſt not with the Fruition of thy chiefeſt Good, thy Will will reject that Good propounded; and if it conſiſt with it, it will meaſure a Motion of the Will towards that Good proportionable to it: and the want of the Knowledge or Sence of this Good ſends the Motions of thy Will on gadding after every Vanity, ſtedfaſt in nothing, willing what it hath not, and weary of what it hath, purſuing a Butter-fly or a Glow-worm with the ſame eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and intention of Soul, as it would do a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial and ſatisfactory Good: when thou ſeeſt a Child fixing the intention of his mind upon a Rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or a Hobby-horſe, more than upon a goodly Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, or upon a Feather or a Riband more than up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Title of Honour conjoyned with Power; and when he hath theſe Toys, to be weary of them, and purſue ſomething elſe; thou canſt eaſily ſee the ground of this Errour in his Valuation to ariſe from his Ignorance of the true difference between them; and this unſtability in his content in them, doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe from the emptineſs and unuſefulneſs of them, and that diſproportion which he finds in them to his expectation; his infant reaſon being yet better able to value in Fruition than in expectation: And yet thou doſt not conſider that the diſproportion of thoſe things, which thy riper Will purſues as Good, as to the chiefeſt Good, is infinitely greater than that of the moſt Childiſh enjoyment to thoſe things, wherein the moſt and wiſeſt of Men place their chief expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and that the Errour of the moſt childiſh Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, laid in the Ballance with the Judgment of the

                        <p>Keep a Guard upon thy <hi>Conſcience;</hi> The chief work of Conſcience in the Soul conſiſts in theſe things: 1. The reception of ſound practical Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: this is the Foundation of all its ſubſequent working, the Major propoſition: 2. The diſcovery of thoſe Actions or purpoſes which are in the Soul: 3. The comparing of thoſe Actions or purpoſes with thoſe former practical grounds: 4. The Concluſion or Judgment upon thoſe Actions and Principles thus compared, of Abſolution or Approbation, or of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation and Rejection: 5. The Motion of the Conſcience towards the Soul upon this conviction, <hi>viz.</hi> Perſwaſion or Diſſuaſion, to or from the Act in queſtion; if future; ſtirring or comforting the Soul in reference to the Act, if paſt. Thy Conſcience is that Cart by which thou doſt, or ſhouldeſt, ſteer thy Courſe in this World towards the other: and therefore it is of higheſt Concernment to have an eye upon it: and therefore,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Learn to furniſh it with practical <hi>Principles</hi> of Truth and Soundneſs. Theſe Principles are, for any thing that appears to me, extrinſecal to the Soul, the Dictates of the Divine Law and Will conveyed into the Conſcience, either by the immediate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation and Demonſtration of God unto the Soul; thus to <hi>Adam</hi> in a perfect meaſure, and to thoſe Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men of God, the Patriarchs, Prophets, and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles; or by the Courſe and way of his Providence, either by unwritten Tradition, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15. and this was a more uncertain Diſpenſation, becauſe more eaſie to be corrupted by the Practices and teachings
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:50435:203"/>
of Men, which were ſo mingled with it, that it was very hard to diſcover the Wheat from the Chaff; ſo that if we ſhould now go to gather up Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples for the Conſcience out of the Practices of Men or Nations, or the Collections of humane Laws or Authors, we ſhould gather up Principles full of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty, contrarieties, and inconſiſtencies among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and ſuch of them as had any ſound Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to truth were ſo general, that ſeveral Men, or the ſame Man at ſeveral times, or upon ſeveral occaſions, would deduce from them a juſtification of contrary Practices; as we ſee is done among divers Men, that admit the ſame general Principles of Practice, and yet upon the ſame Principles their Conſciences, when they come to particular Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, act quite contrary one to the other: the great and merciful God hath therefore, by a wonderful Courſe of his Providence, conveyed unto us a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of practical Principles made by himſelf, even the <hi>Word</hi> of his Truth, admirably adequated to our uſe, eſpecially in two things: 1. Of their Truth and Infallibility, we cannot miſtake them, for they are the very Revelations of the God of Truth, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled with the Sophiſtications and Corruptions of Men, Gold ſeven times tryed: 2.

<pb n="369" facs="tcp:50435:203"/>
of the Book are full of admirable Truth and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, infinitely out-going all the writings of Men, yet there is more in it than this; even a Promiſe of a Bleſſing of it, to as many as ſeriouſly make it their ſtudy and Rule of Life and Faith, and a fulfilling of that Promiſe, the Son of God ſending his own Spirit along with the uſe of that Word, Life with the Letter, into the Soul: And this was that which made this Law of God, though compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in a little Volume, to be ſo exceeding wide, and precious to <hi>David;</hi> there went along with it, and with his Meditation of it, a Spirit of Life and Light, that ſhewed him larger. Dimenſions of it, than could be found by the bare ſtrength of his natural Underſtanding.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Take leiſure upon all thy Actions and purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to acquaint thy Conſcience with them, that ſo thy Conſcience may have time to deliberate, and to compare it with its Principle, the Word of God. Precipitancy and Haſtineſs in Actions robs the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of that employment, which God hath given to it; and as it is the Mother of all ſin, ſo it brings a double inconvenience to a Man, even from his Conſcience, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. A deadneſs and unprofitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the faculty: It is ſo kept under and out of employment, that it forgets her buſineſs: when it is laid aſide and ſeldom conſulted with, it grows unexpert and unable to give an Anſwer, when it may be we deſire it: The direction of Conſcience, where it is well uſed, is ſeldom without the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate direction of the very Spirit of God; and when the Guidance of that Spirit is neglected, it will not return to thy aſſiſtance when thou pleaſeſt: 2. It turns that, which would be thy Counſellor, into thy Accuſer and Tormentor: thou refuſeſt to give her time to do her Office before thy Action, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:50435:204"/>
it will be bold to take time to do her Office after: She cannot be admitted to adviſe thee, but ſhe will take Liberty to accuſe and ſting thee.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Endeavour ſtill to keep thy Conſcience tender and ſenſible: Rather deſire to be troubled with a ſeemingly peeviſh Conſcience, that will check almoſt at any thing, than to be at quiet with a dull and ſtupid Conſcience, that will down with any thing: It may be it will be ſomewhat troubleſome, but it is ſafe, and thou ſhalt find Comfort in forbearing of that, which thy tender Conſcience wiſht thee to foregoe, and be able abundantly to ſatisfie that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble which thou art put to by thy forbearance: The Conſcience of thine Integrity will be more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory to thee, than the curioſity of thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience will be troubleſome: And be very prudent and curious in thy Diſputations with thy Conſcience; thou mayſt, before thou art aware, diſpute thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience into Stupidity, or thy ſelf into perplexity.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Obſerve exactly the Language of thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to thy Soul; for moſt commonly the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience takes part with her Maker: if ſhe perſwade, be doing; if ſhe diſſuade, forbear: He, that in the Fear of God liſtens to the Voice of his Conſcience in a thing of it ſelf indifferent, yet over ballanced from its indifferency by the Dictate of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, performs a work of Obedience to God well near as acceptable as he that doth a work of its own Nature good; for as much as the Life and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality of any good work conſiſts not ſo much in the Nature of the thing that is done, as in the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or ground of the doing it, <hi>viz.</hi> the Love of God: And that man that, having endeavoured to Principle his Conſcience aright with the Word of truth, doth honeſtly and ſincerely follow the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of it, ſhall be ſure not to erre long or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly:
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:50435:204"/>
God, having placed the Conſcience in our Breaſt as his own Vicegerent, looks upon ſuch a ſubjection to the Conſcience as an Obedience to himſelf, and his own Authority, and will in due time by his own Power and Spirit inlighten and guide ſuch a Conſcience to perform his Office regularly and effectually.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. As a conſequence of the former, when a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion ariſeth in thy Conſcience, whether ſuch a thing may be ſafely omitted, which thou art ſure may be ſafely done; or whether ſuch a thing may be ſafely done, which thou art ſure may be ſafely forborn; put not thy ſelf, nor thy Conſcience, upon a Diſpute where thou needeſt not; but be content rather to abridge thy ſelf from a Liberty, that may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably lawful, than to put thy ſelf upon an Action or Omiſſion that may at leaſt be diſputably ſinful; and ſo much the rather becauſe thy Heart is deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and as it loves Liberty, ſo it finds out Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry enough to corrupt thy Judgment and thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, if thou give way unto it: there is ſcarce the groſſeſt ſin, that ever any Man committed, but his Heart found out ſome Reaſons to bribe or quiet his Conſcience in the Commiſſion of it: Rather ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the ſtill Voice of thy Conſcience in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint even of thy lawful Liberty, though it give thee not a Reaſon for it; than liſten to the reaſonings of thy Heart for the allowance of it: Suſpect her, for ſhe ſpeaks in her own cauſe, and is partial and deceitful. This on the one hand may be a ſafe Rule for us touching Stage-Plays, long Hair, Gaming, U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> on the other, touching the ſtrict Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lord's Day, ſet times of Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="6">6. As an incident likewiſe to the former, when a queſtion comes in thy Conſcience touching a thing whether to be done or not, and that upon the ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:50435:205"/>
of thy Conſcience it ſeems to be equally bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanced, no Rule to guide thee, no Circumſtance that thrown into the Scale can take away the indifferency of either ſide, it is a ſafe Rule, though not always neceſſary, to forſake that which the inclination of thy own natural Appetite moſt prompts thee to: The Reaſon is that which is before mentioned, the Heart is apt to magnifie thoſe Arguments that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the execution of that, which ſuits with thy ſinful Appetite, and to leſſen and ſlight thoſe, that make againſt it: So that in a Deciſion of indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency in ſuch a competition a Man may in a more impartial Judgment conclude the thing to be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not indifferent, but ſinful, becauſe thy ſinful Heart can but bring up what ſhe loves but to an equal Ballance: thou muſt therefore in ſuch a Caſe never hold that Gold paſſable, which doth not turn the Scale.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. As thus in the Directing Operation of thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in things to be done, or not to be done, ſo in the motion of thy Conſcience <hi>after the things done or omitted:</hi> Sometimes the Conſcience is ſilent before the Action, yet ſhe ſpeaks after, and according to that Language of thy Conſcience, ſo let the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thy Soul be: If it approve and juſtifie the thing done, bleſs thy Creator for the Action, and bleſs thy Creator for thy Conſcience that he is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to give thee a reward within thy ſelf of thy Integrity: If thy Conſcience blame thee, though never ſo little, deſpiſe not, nor neglect this ſecret Check; it is a Meſſage from Heaven that ſummons thee to theſe <hi>Duties:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. To <hi>Thankfulneſs</hi> to God, that is pleaſed not to give thee over to incurable Guilt of hardneſs of Heart; that though thou haſt rejected the Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thy Lord ſent by thy Conſcience before thou

                        <p n="2">2. To <hi>Humiliation</hi> and ſorrow of Heart: This as it is the natural and genuine effect of a Guilt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, (unleſs the Heart be given over to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate Senſe) ſo it is a moſt uſeful effect, becauſe it makes the Heart ſoft, and fit to receive thoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, which will enſue upon ſuch a Sorrow, fit to receive Inſtruction, a proud Heart will not bend, nor yield; fit to take up Reſolutions of amendment; the preſent Senſe of Guilt ſhews ſin to the Soul in its own true Dreſs, it is bitterneſs in the end; fit to implore a Pardon, and fit to receive it, becauſe it now knows how truly to value it: And though thy greater ſin deſerve thy greater Sorrow, yet thy very failings, ſins of daily incurſion, Erro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="377" facs="tcp:50435:207"/>
eſteem, or other Acceſſions, then it is turned into Envy, and that Envy into Revenge. And this was the very Original of the Devils immediate action upon our firſt Parents; his Pride though it made him lower by his fall, it made him not more humble. And from hence ariſeth Murmuring and Diſcontent, becauſe that which befalls him croſſeth him in his ſelf opinion of his own Merit or Deſert. And from hence proceeds the rejection of God, and of his directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, from an opinion of a ſelf-ſufficiency and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. To cure this Diſtemper and the products of it, labour for Poverty and Humility of Spirit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe <hi>Conſiderations:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. That whatſoever thou haſt of worth or good in thee, it is not thy own, it is a derived good; the good that is moſt thy own, even thy eſſential good, is not thy own, thou oweſt thy Being to ſomewhat with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thee: But grant it were thine own, yet the Comfort and Life, and Beauty of thy Being were nothing without a farther good that is not thy own: thy Power, thy Wealth, thy Strength, thy Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, theſe are not in thy Eſſence, they are deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Goods, and ſuch as are not from thy ſelf: the moſt exact faculty of thy Soul, is but empty till it be filled by an Object without thee: In thy higheſt Fruition thou haſt a juſt occaſion to magnifie God, from whom thou haſt it; not to magnifie thy ſelf, that doſt only receive it: Learn therefore the Original of that good, whatever it be, that thou enjoyeſt, it will make thee thankful and keep thee humble.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That in thy ſelf thou haſt nothing but emptineſs and vanity; Thou hadſt a good, it is true, which was ſent thee by the Lord of thy Being, and that we have ſhewn was no occaſion to exalt thy ſelf, becauſe it was not thine own: but even that thou haſt loſt now, and
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:50435:208"/>
thy Nature hath nothing left thee whereof to be Proud.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. That it is impoſſible for thee to come to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy that which muſt make thee happy, till thou art deeply ſenſible of thy own emptineſs and nothing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and thy Spirit thereby brought down and laid in the duſt: As long as thy Soul is full of thy Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, or of thy Wealth, or of the World, or of thy own Righteouſneſs, or Worth, there is no room for thy Saviour, or his fulneſs: thou wilt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him, becauſe thou findeſt not any want; and thou canſt not receive him, becauſe thou haſt no room: And as it indiſpoſeth thee to receive good from God; ſo it indiſpoſeth (as I may ſay) God to give it: for thy Pride aſſumeth that both from God which is his, and applies it to thy ſelf, even that acknowledgment and Honour, which is a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute wholly and only due to God: and hence it is that he reſiſts the Proud, becauſe they rob him of the Duty, that by all the Laws and Reaſons imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable thou oweſt to him.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. That the Grace of God, the Knowledge and Senſe of his Love, the Spirit of Chriſt is an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Spirit; the more thou haſt of it, the more it will humble thee; and it is a ſign that either thou haſt it not, or that it is yet over-maſtered by thy corruption; if thy Heart be ſtill haughty: it ſhews thee thy ſelf in thy true Dreſs, and makes thee abhor thy ſelf: it ſhews thee the Purity and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of the great God, with whom thou haſt to deal, and teacheth thee Fear and Honour towards him: it teacheth thee to live by thy Saviour's Life, to be righteous by his Purity, to be ſaved by his Sufferings, to walk by his Rule, and to aim at his Glory: it ſhews thee that thou haſt all from him, and frames thy Heart to return all to him: It reſtores thee to that

                        <p>HITHERTO we have conſidered the Duty and Means of Mortification, the putting off of the Old Man, thoſe Diſtempers and Diſorders of our Souls, by which they become unconformable to the Image and Mind of God; the Principle whereof is the Spirit and Grace of God given us in Chriſt; and the Means of this work thoſe which we have before mentioned: Now we come to conſider of that <hi>New Life,</hi> which follows hereupon moſt neceſſarily:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Becauſe it proceeds moſt neceſſarily from the ſame Principle. As in a natural Man fallen into ſome Diſtemper, it is the ſame ſtrength of Nature that conquers the Diſeaſe, and it being conquered, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the Body in its natural Operations, which is Health; ſo the ſame vital power of the Spirit of God is that, which overmatched thoſe Diſtempers in our Soul, which are contrary to our ſpiritual Life and Motion, and conſerves that Conſtitution of Health in the Soul, by which it moves regularly and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:50435:209"/>
to the Will of God, which is our New Life.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Becauſe the Motion of thoſe Diſtempers, which fit in our Soul, doth neceſſarily conform our Souls to that condition in which we were created. God at firſt created us in a Conformity unto himſelf; our ſin brought an impotency upon our Nature, by which we contracted all thoſe Corruptions and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers, that have diſordered our Souls, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted us from God, when God is pleaſed, by the power of his own Spirit purchaſed for us by the Blood of Chriſt, to put into us a Principle of life and ſtrength to work out thoſe Corruptions and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders of our Souls, there muſt neceſſarily follow a life conformable to the Will of God, and as there is no <hi>Medium</hi> between Life and Death, ſo when this Death of our Souls is removed by that Principle of Life, there neceſſarily follows a New Life, and new Operations anſwerable to it.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The End of the Motion of thoſe diſorders of the Soul is in order to our New Life: 1 Pet. 2.24. <hi>That we being dead to ſin, ſhould live to Righteouſneſs:</hi> Epheſ. 2.10. <hi>Created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works.</hi> It was the end of the Death of Chriſt, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14. the Tree that bore wild Figs, and that which bore none, were equally curſed. John 15.2. <hi>Every branch in me that beareth not fruit, he taketh away.</hi> So then the work of Mortification and Sanctification differ only in their Relations, not in themſelves: they are both effects of that ſame Life, which, by the Spirit of Chriſt and our Union to him, is wrought in us: they both drive to the ſame End, even to our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to our Head, Chriſt Jeſus, which is our Conformity to the Will of God, wherein conſiſts the Perfection of every Creature: <hi>For this is the Will of God, even your Sanctification,</hi> 1 Theſ. 4.3.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="381" facs="tcp:50435:209"/>The Honour and Glory of God is, and ought to be, the ſupream End of all actions and things in the World. And this is that, which every Creature in his right ſtation and condition doth drive at, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the meaſure and degree of its natural perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: for as the great End of God in all his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is his own Glory, ſo every Creature having a conformity to the Will of God, is moved by him towards that End. And as this is the greateſt and chiefeſt End of all Creatures and Actions, ſo the motion towards it, muſt needs be the moſt perfect operation of the Creature. And as this Truth is ſounded in Nature and Reaſon, ſo it is the good Pleaſure of Almighty God to joyn the Perfection and Happineſs of the Creature in this Conformity to his Mind and Will. When any thing therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues in an univerſal free ſubjection and ſubſervience to the Will of God, as that very ſubjection and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervience is an Honour to the Lord of his Being, ſo by that ſubjection and ſubſervience, is the Creature moved and managed to the Glory of God, even to the fulfilling of his Will, and, as a neceſſary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant to it, to its own Perfection and Happineſs. Chriſt, that was in all things conformable to the Mind and Will of God, for he came to do the Will of his Father, came into this World to bring Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the great God by his Creature Man, and, as a concomitant and a neceſſary Conſequent of it, Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and Perfection to Man: and to that End, firſt he ſets him free from that Guilt and Curſe, which he contracted by his Fall; removes from him thoſe Fetters of the Power and Reign of Sin, whereby he was diſabled to move conformably to the Will of God; puts into him a Spirit of Life, that may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able him to live to God, and be conformable to his Will, and move to his Glory: and this is his <hi>Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</hi>
                           <pb n="382" facs="tcp:50435:210"/>
So then next to that great and ultimate End of the Glory of God, the Sanctification of the Creature, and rendering it conformable to the Will of God, was the greateſt End of Chriſt's work of Redemption, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.25, 26, 27. <hi>Even as Chriſt alſo loved the Church, and gave himſelf for it, that he might ſanctifie and cleanſe it,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.74. <hi>that we being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>might ſerve him without fear in Holineſs and Righteouſneſs,</hi> Tit. 2.14. <hi>who gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purifie unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a peculiar people,</hi> &amp;c. So that even our Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is in order to our Sanctification, and that in order to the Glory of God, <hi>viz.</hi> that his Creature might be conformable to his Will, and might active<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly move to the Glory of the Creator, wherein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts his End, and with which is joyned the Creatures Happineſs.</p>
                        <p>Touching this matter, theſe <hi>things</hi> are <hi>conſiderable,</hi> 1. The Neceſſity of it: 2. The Means, whereby it is effected: 3. The Degrees of it: 4. The Parts or Extent of it.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That the Sanctification of the Heart and Life is abſolutely <hi>Neceſſary</hi> to every Chriſtian, in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure anſwerable to his natural Perfection, upon theſe Conſiderations:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. It was the End of the coming of Chriſt into the World, and the very End of thy Juſtification. His End was not only to remove thy Guilt and thy Curſe, but to make thee conformable to the Will of thy Creator, that thou mayeſt be actively ſubſervient unto his Glory, which thou canſt not be, unleſs thy Nature be changed, as well as thy Sin pardoned. The great End of the coming of Chriſt, was to bring Glory to his Father. If he only free thee from thy Guilt, he brings Mercy to his Creature: but unleſs he cleanſe and change thy Nature, thou remaineſt uſeleſs to thy Maſter.</p>
                        <p n="2">
                           <pb n="383" facs="tcp:50435:210"/>2 It is impoſſible, that there can be Juſtification of any Man; but that according to the meaſure of his natural ability, there will be likewiſe a cleanſing and changing of his Nature: becauſe the knowledge and belief of the Love of God in Chriſt, cannot be in Heart without a return of Love from the Soul again to God. The very ſame act of the Spirit and Grace of God, which diſcovers and unites the ſenſe of the Love of God to thy Soul, doth as naturally cauſe Love in thee to God, as the union of the <hi>Species</hi> to the Glaſs, reflects the Reſemblance from the Glaſs again, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.19. <hi>We love him, becauſe he loved us firſt:</hi> his was a Love of Pity, Compaſſion, a Love of Bounty and Goodneſs, a Love that broke through Death and greater difficulties than Death, even the uniting of the Divinity to our Fleſh; a Love paſſing Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: and thine cannot chuſe but be a Love of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration and Aſtoniſhment, a Love of Thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Gratitude. When the Spirit of God works Faith in thee, it worketh by Love, even by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the Love of God to thy Soul in as full di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions as thy Soul can receive it: and when Faith is wrought in thy Soul, that worketh again by Love to God. If thou haſt not Love to God, thou haſt not Faith in him: and if thou haſt Love to him, thou canſt not chuſe but conform thy ſelf to his Mind and his Will, <hi>John</hi> 14.23. <hi>If a man love me, he will keep my words.</hi> And for this cauſe the Apoſtle makes it not only an inconſiſtency, but a kind of impoſſibility for one juſtified, to continue in ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.2. <hi>How ſhall we, that are dead to ſin, live any longer therein?</hi> 1 John 3.9. <hi>he cannot ſin, becauſe he is born of God:</hi> In every act of known ſin, that thou committeſt, and every omiſſion of every known good, that thou neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecteſt, there is an actual intermiſſion or ſuppreſſion of the act of Faith, and of thy Love to God.</p>
                        <p n="3">
                           <pb n="384" facs="tcp:50435:211"/>3. It is a neceſſary conſequent of our <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with Chriſt.</hi> There is, as hath been ſhewed, a double act, whereby our Union with Chriſt is wrought; on our part, an act of Faith to apprehend him; on his part, an act of his Spirit, whereby he apprehends us, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.1, 2. and this Union is ſo ſtrict, that it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled to thoſe things, that have the ſtricteſt Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the Vine and the Branches, <hi>John</hi> 15.1, 2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.18. Members of his Body, of his Fleſh, and of his Bones, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.30. and as in the virtue of this Union we partake of all theſe Priviledges, which were in him, his Satisfaction, his Righteouſneſs, his Sonſhip, his Interceſſion, his Reſurrection; ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of his Spirit, as there is one Body, ſo there is one Spirit, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.4. <hi>If any man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his,</hi> Rom. 8.9. It is his in Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, it is ours in Operation and Influence: ſo that the inward Life of a Chriſtian is not his own, but he lives by the Life, that is, that living Spirit of the Son of God. Now as that Spirit or Life, that is in the Root, when it paſſeth into the Branch, makes the Branch conformable in Nature and Fruit unto the Root: So the Spirit of Chriſt transfuſed into a Chriſtian, doth conform his Nature and Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions unto Chriſt; for that was the great End of God in ſending his Son into the World, who was in all things conformable unto him, that we ſhould be conformable to the Image of his Son, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29. And thus that impreſſion of the Image of God, which was loſt in <hi>Adam,</hi> is re-imprinted by him, that was the expreſs Image of his Father, by the ſecret tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of his own pure and operative Spirit into all thoſe, that are united unto him: and thereby the Will of God is fulfilled. <hi>Be ye holy, for I am holy,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.16.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. It is neceſſary as a Preparation or Pre-diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Soul, to that everlaſting condition of Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs,
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:50435:211"/>
which it expects in Heaven: the place a holy place, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19. an immortal and undefiled Inheritance, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. where nothing that defileth can enter, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.27.

                           <hi>CHAP. XXV.</hi> Of the Means of Sanctification, and <hi>1.</hi> On God's part, his Word, and his Spirit.</head>
                        <p n="2">2. THE <hi>Means</hi> whereby this is effected, are either properly on God's part, or on ours.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>On God's part,</hi> his Word and his Spirit, 1. The <hi>Word of God:</hi> He, having to deal with Creatures, which he hath endued with Senſe and underſtanding, hath been pleaſed in his Wiſdom and Providence to preſerve and deliver unto us his written Word, whereby the Truths therein contained, may be united to our Underſtanding. And this Word, as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the holy Counſels of the holy God, ſo the Truths therein contained, do naturally tend to our Sanctification, though of it ſelf, as a bare Moral Cauſe, it be not ſufficient to effect it, in reſpect of our indiſpoſition and deadneſs, which muſt have a Spirit of Life to quicken us, and make that Word operative upon us. Now in reſpect of the tendency of this Word to our Sanctification, and in as much as God is pleaſed by it, to work this work in us, therefore often our Sanctification is attributed at leaſt inſtrumentally to it, <hi>John</hi> 17.17. <hi>Sanctifie them through thy truth: thy word is truth.</hi> Pſal. 19.7. <hi>the law of the Lord is perfect, converting the ſoul,</hi> John 15.3. <hi>Now are ye clean through the word that I have ſpoken.</hi> All which tend to no more than this, that this Word of God contains thoſe Truths in it, which, being truly known and believed, do conform the Soul to the Will of God, that Image, which he firſt caſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="387" facs="tcp:50435:212"/>Now the general Truths, which this Book Exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits to us, tending to this end, are principally two:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. It diſcovers what that will of God concerning Man is: and this it doth two ways; 1. By Precepts of moſt excellent and ſound Juſtice and Reaſon, which are nothing elſe, but the Repetitions of that Law, which was at firſt in our Nature: 2. By Examples, eſpecially that Example of our Saviour's, who was the Image of the inviſible God, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.15. and therefore in our imitation of him, we re-aſſume that impreſſion of God's Image, which we once loſt. Now Chriſt's Life, as it was a Meritorious Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, ſo it was an Exemplary Righteouſneſs, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.29. <hi>Learn of me, for I am meek,</hi> John 13.15. <hi>For I have given you an Example, that ye ſhould do as I have done,</hi> Epheſ. 4.13. the meaſure of his ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>e, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.5. the mind of Chriſt.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. It diſcovers a great deal of convincing Reaſon, why we ſhould conform to this Will of God: 1. In reſpect of the Commands themſelves, it ſhews their Righteouſneſs, Juſtice and Perfection, and that in our conformity to them conſiſts our Perfection. 2. In reſpect of God, that commands them: 1. It is he requires it, that is the Author and Lord of thy Being, and thou canſt not chuſe, but infinitely owe what he requires: 2. It is he requires it, that will not, cannot be mocked; he is infinitely able to avenge the rebellion of his Creature: 3. It is he commands it, that hath been a Bountiful, Merciful God unto thee, that when thou haſt incurred his Curſe, hath provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a Sacrifice to expiate it; when thou haſt diſabled thy ſelf to obey, provides a Spirit of his own to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt thee; that when thou falleſt, pities, pardons, and reſtores thee, and though he owes it not to thee, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his own Grace and work in thee with an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Glory to thee. And what natural ingenuity
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:50435:213"/>
can chuſe but ingage to the uttermoſt expreſſion of his thankfulneſs to ſuch a God by a moſt advantageous Obedience? 3. In reſpect of thy ſelf, if thou diſobey, the loſs is thy own; if thou obey, the benefit is thine, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.15. <hi>For I have ſet before thee Life and Good, and Death and Evil.</hi> And herein among divers others, is the Excellency of the Word of God; as it contains Precepts of moſt ſingular Purity, and evidencing their own Perfection; ſo it inforceth the Obedience upon Reaſons of greater ſtrength and more powerful Perſwaſions, than all the Writings of Men ever did or could: by annexing Rewards and Puniſhments of a higher conſtitution, than the divineſt Philoſophers ever thought of.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>The Spirit of God:</hi> Hence this work is attributed to the Spirit of God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Through Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit unto Obedience:</hi> and this principally theſe three ways: 1. In preparing and diſpoſing the Heart: 2. In accompanying and coming in with the Word: 3. In following that Work with a continual aſſiſtance of direction and ſtrength.</p>

<pb n="389" facs="tcp:50435:213"/>
a ſecret diſpoſition and calming of Heart before, whereby ſome external act of the Providence of God, which is prepared and fitted for that occaſion, ſtrikes effectually upon the Heart, and works upon it, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be an Affliction, or a Bleſſing, or a Deliverance, or a Word of God. Thus when <hi>Nathaniel</hi> was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Fig tree, Chriſt ſaw him, and prepared his Heart to entertain the call of <hi>Philip, John</hi> 1.48.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The <hi>concomitant</hi> act of the Spirit of God, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>with the Word of God, and ſome other</hi> extraordinary acts of his Providence. And herein it hath a <hi>double</hi> work: 1. Of <hi>Strength</hi> to drive on this Word: and hence it is called the Sword of the Spirit. The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God is that Arm that manageth this Sword, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.17. <hi>To the dividing aſunder of Soul and Spirit,</hi> Heb. 4.12. When thou ſeeſt therefore a tumultuous, diſorderly Heart, filled with Pride and obſtinacy, yet brought upon his Knees by a ſeemingly weak Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, Reproof, or other paſſage of the Word of God, wonder not at the change; for the powerful and mighty Arm of the Spirit of God hath ſhaken this little dart between the joynts of his harneſs, even into the midſt of his Soul. <hi>What ailed thee, O thou Sea, that thou fleddeſt?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Tremble thou Earth at the preſence of the Lord, at the preſence of the God of Jacob,</hi> Pſal. 114.5.2. Of <hi>Life</hi> to go along with it into the Spirit of a Man, <hi>John</hi> 6.63. <hi>The words that I ſpeak unto you, they are Spirit, and they are Life.</hi> The paſſage between the Senſe and the Spirit of a Man is of a great diſtance, and full of many turnings: and hence the words of Men, for the moſt part die and loſe their efficacy before they come at the Spirit of a Man; ſometimes they die in the Ear, ſometimes they get into the Brain, and die there in a Speculation, ſometimes they ſtrike a little, but yet live not long there, for the words have no Life in them: But with this Word there goes a
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:50435:214"/>
Life, which goes along with it, even to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt corner of thy Soul, even thy Spirit, and there it continues alive, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.9. <hi>His ſeed remaineth in him, and he cannot ſin:</hi> and hence it is, that the Commands of God, even to us that are dead, are not incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, when God pleaſeth that his Work ſhall be wrought in the Heart, for a Spirit of Life goes along with the Command, even to the <hi>penetralia animae, John</hi> 5.25. <hi>The time is that the dead ſhall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear ſhall live.</hi> And as thus the Spirit of God carries the Word of God with Life and Vigour into the choiceſt parts of the Soul; ſo doth it with all other Diſpenſations of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence: If thou haſt an outward Bleſſing given thee, it will along with the Senſe of thy Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing carry in the Senſe of the Goodneſs of God, and teach thee Thankfulneſs and Moderation: If an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, it will get along into thy Soul with that Affliction, and teach thee to examine thy ſelf, and to ſearch and try thy ways, and having diſcovered thy ſin, it will teach thee Humiliation and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; and if upon thy ſearch thou find thine Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, yet it will teach thee Humility, Thankfulneſs, Contentedneſs, Dependance upon God: it will with every Diſpenſation of Providence go along with it into thy Soul, and carry that meſſage with it, that God by this his Diſpenſation intends to ſend thee. And thus it is a Sanctifying Spirit by way of conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitance with the Word and Providence.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The Spirit of God ſanctifies the Heart by its own immediate and <hi>Continual Aſſiſtance:</hi> It conteſts with thy daily Temptations, that are from without, and conquers them; and with thy hourly Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that are within thee, and waſts and ſubdues them: In the midſt of thy Difficulties, it will be thy Counſellor, a ſecret voice behind thee, ſaying, <hi>This
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:50435:214"/>
is the way, walk, in it:</hi> In the midſt of thy Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, it will be thy Strength, and a Grace ſufficient for thee: In the midſt of thy Troubles, it will be thy Light and thy Comfort: In the midſt of thy Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, it will be thy Cleanſer, a Spirit of burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to conſume thoſe ſwarms of Luſts, that cover and fill thy Heart: In thy Failings and Falls, it will be thy Remembrancer, and teach thee to repent and humble thy ſelf. This was that Monitor, that fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed <hi>Joſeph</hi> with an anſwer to a moſt importunate and advantageous Temptation: <hi>How ſhall I do this great wickedneſs, and ſin againſt God? Gen.</hi> 39.9. that furniſhed <hi>Job</hi> with ſilencing Anſwers to all thoſe temptations to Inſolence, Pride, Self-confidence, and Injuſtice, <hi>Job</hi> 9.1. that after <hi>David</hi>'s Sin ſmote <hi>David</hi>'s Heart, before <hi>David</hi>'s Heart ſmote him, and taught him Confeſſion and Sorrow, and to beg a Pardon, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.10. Only beware thou neglect not the Voice of this Spirit of God: It may be, thy neglect may quench it, and thou mayeſt never hear that Voice more: or at leaſt, it will certainly grieve it; and canſt thou think of grieving that Spirit without a Tear, which is content to deſcend into thy impure, polluted Heart, to make it a Heart fitted for Glory? Thy folly is great, and thy ingratitude greater: When God ſpeaks once, and twice, and Man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives him not, <hi>Job</hi> 33.14. it ſometimes falls out that he never ſpeaks to that Man more. <hi>Ephraim is ſet upon Idols, let him alone, Hoſ.</hi> 4.17. and that is the ſaddeſt Condition in the World: but if he do, his Mercy will be a ſevere Mercy, he will ſpeak louder, <hi>Job</hi> 33.22. when the ſtill Voice is not heard, his Soul draweth near to the grave, and his Life to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyers. The obſervation of the ſecret Admonition and Reaſonings of the Spirit of God in the Heart, as it is an effectual means, ſo it is a calm and a comfortable

                        <p>
                           <hi>ON our part,</hi> the Inſtruments of our Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are thoſe ſupernatural acts or habits of the Soul, wrought by the finger of God, Faith, Hope, and Love.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Faith,</hi> Acts 15.9. <hi>God alſo purifying their Hearts by Faith.</hi> And this it doth as it is an Act receiving into the Soul the Word of God, and ſubſcribing to the Truth and Goodneſs of it; receving it not as the word of Man, but as the Word of the juſt and true God.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. It therein finds and believes the great Debt of Duty that the Creature owes to his Creator. What can be unjuſt for God to require of that Being, which he gave and made? As the Gift of a Being is an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Gift, becauſe it is an infinite Motion, there being no greater diſproportion imaginable, than between not being and being; ſo the engagement of Obedience and Conformity from that Creature, to the Will and good Pleaſure of its Author, is infinite and bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs by all the Juſtice that can be.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Faith doth find in that Word a farther ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Conformity and Obedience, if a farther may
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:50435:215"/>
be, in that it finds the immenſe overflowing Love of God to Man: It is that Love, that did at firſt fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him with thoſe Excellencies of his Nature, with that greater excellency, his image and Superſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: It is that Love, that upholds his temporal Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and bleſſeth it; It is that love that, when he was loſt, ſent a Sacrifice, and a Righteouſneſs for him, whereby he is not only pardoned from his Guilt and Curſe, but reſtored to Glory and immortality. And this it doth truly and really believe, and is thereby convinced that there is a greater obligation, than that of his Nature, to live conformable to the Will and Mind of ſo unſpeakable a Benefactor.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Faith doth find in this Word of God his Mind and Will, and believes it to be that very Rule, the conformity whereunto is well pleaſing and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God. Mic. 6.8. <hi>and what doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but to do juſtly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?</hi> It looks upon every Admonition, Exhortation, Reprehenſion, and Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as the very immediate Meſſage of God unto the Soul, and entertains it with the ſame awe and reverence as if it were audibly delivered in Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and trembles at it: and therefore it receives it in the power and Life of it, and in the uttermoſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs and extent of it: it will not take this part as moſt conſonant to thy Temper, Condition, Deſigns, Conſtitution or Ends, and reject another part where it croſſeth them, becauſe it is equally the Will and Command of the great God, and ſo received.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Faith finds in this Word, the Rectitude, Juſtice, and Regularity of the Will of God concerning Man: they are not only juſt as proceeding from him, to whom his Creature owes an infinite Obedience, as was the Command to <hi>Adam</hi> for forbearing the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden Fruit, or to <hi>Abraham</hi> to ſacrifice his Son;
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:50435:216"/>
but Faith finds in theſe Commands a natural Juſtice, and Reaſonableneſs, and Perfection, and concludes with <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 19. <hi>That his Statutes are right, and his Commands pure,</hi> ſuch as include in themſelves a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and abſolute Beauty, and ſuch as confer upon the Creature a Perfection, and Happineſs, ſuch as are exactly conformable to thy Nature, were thy Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture conformable to it ſelf: for as the Rule or Law, that God hath given to every Creature, is that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in conſiſts its Beauty, Preſervation and Perfection, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the degree wherein it is placed, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore every Creature labours according to its own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to continue in that Rule, and when it miſſeth it, it contracts Deformity and Corruption; ſo the Divine Law or Command of God given to Man is that wherein conſiſts his Perfection, as being a Rule moſt exactly conformable to the reaſonable Nature of Man: ſin hath deformed and blinded us that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not now ſee that Perfection and Excellency, that is in our Conformity to his Will, and hath perverted and corrupted us, that as we are in this corrupted condition we cannot deſire it; but when God is pleaſed to anoint our eyes with the Eye-ſalve of Faith, and preſents this Glaſs, this image of his mind in his Word unto that Eve; Faith again diſcerns, and diſcerning cannot chuſe but deſire that Beauty, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and Rectitude, which is there diſcovered in the Commands of God, and the conformity of the Soul to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ame.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Faith doth find in that Word, and finding it doth moſt aſſuredly believe the Preſence of the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and infinite God in every place, even in the darkeſt and moſt remote Corners and Chambers of the Heart, ſearching, weighing, and diſcerning the Spirit, every thought of the Heart, every word of the Tongue, every action of the Life, and meaſuring
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:50435:216"/>
them exactly with the Rule, that he hath given: and this keeps the Heart in a continual awe of the Preſence of God, purgeth out all Hypocriſie, ſets a continual Watch upon the whole Man, lays a Bridle upon the very thoughts, and brings them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſubjection to this Rule; becauſe that clear and pure, and ſevere eye of the Great and Infinite God ſearcheth the moſt retired thoughts of the Heart, and obſerves what conformity they hold with his moſt Juſt and Reaſonable Command.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Faith finds in this Word of God, and doth more really and practically believe, that that great God which hath given us his Will, and is a witneſs to the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Diſobedience of it, hath moſt certainly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed an everlaſting Curſe to the Diſobedience of it, ſo it hath moſt certainly annexed an everlaſting Glory to the Obedience thereunto, not as the merit of it; but as the free and bountiful gift of his Goodneſs and Mercy in Jeſus Chriſt: And it finds and believes the Truth, and Faithfulneſs, and Glory, and Power, of the Infinite God there engaged for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of it: and therefore it binds the Heart to the Obedience of this Will of God, and Conformity un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it; which is our Sanctification. Thus the word mingled with Faith cleanſeth and ſanctifieth, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteth, and purifieth the Heart and Life. And as thus in Man God uſeth this inſtrument on Mans part to ſanctifie his Creature, and make him conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to himſelf; ſo Secondarily upon this Act of Faith upon the Word of God, as its Object, the Heart is likewiſe cleanſed by Fear, Hope, and Love, by way of emanation from this Act of Faith.</p>
                        <p>Love, Fear, and Hope are thoſe ſeveral Motions or Affections of the Soul, that ariſe from the ſame Act of Faith, only as Faith is diverſified according to thoſe different Objects apprehended by Faith, or
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:50435:217"/>
according to the different Notions, Relations or Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the ſame Object, as for inſtance, God appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in his Goodneſs, Love and Bounty, moves our Love towards him; as apprehended in his Glory, Majeſty, Power, and Juſtice, excites Fear; as appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in his Faithfulneſs, Truth, and Promiſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets Hope: and each of theſe Affections thus direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, do habituate and diſpoſe the Soul and Life to a religious frame and Conſtitution, which is our San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, as will appear in theſe particulars:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The <hi>Love</hi> of God: this is that true Principle of all true Obedience; where it is not, the Obedience is a dead and unacceptable Obedience; for God that is a Spirit, and will be worſhipped in Spirit and Truth, will be obeyed likewiſe in Spirit and Truth; and the outward Conformity without this is but a dead O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience and Hypocriſie; and where it is it will work a Conformity of the Heart and Life to the mind of God, upon which it is pitched, and therefore it is called the Firſt and Great Commandment, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.51. the fulfilling of the Law, becauſe when it is once wrought in the Heart, whatſoever it can diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be agreeable to the Will of him that ſhe loves, it will moſt ſincerely and intirely obey: John 14.15.24. <hi>If ye love me keep my Commandments: he that loveth me not, keepeth not my Sayings.</hi> Now our Love to God ariſeth upon two Grounds: 1. From a Senſe of the Perfection and Beauty, and Purity, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency that is in him: and in this reſpect our Love to him cannot chuſe but move the Heart to deſire to be like unto him, as far forth, as is, or can be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable to our Nature and Condition; for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever I love in another, that is communicable unto me; I cannot chuſe but deſire to be in my ſelf, 1 Pet. 2. <hi>Be ye holy, for I am holy,</hi> and this Love of that Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that is in God, doth bring the Heart nearer to
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:50435:217"/>
him, for Love is a Motion unto Union; and as we come nearer to that Purity of his, it doth in ſome meaſure aſſimilate the Soul unto himſelf, becauſe his Goodneſs and Brightneſs is an aſſimilating, active, communicative Goodneſs, and from this nearneſs to him doth grow much of our Holineſs here, and all our Happineſs hereafter, 1 John 3.2. <hi>We ſhall b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap> like him, for we ſhall ſee him as he is,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.18. <hi>But we with open Face beholding as in a Glaſs, the Glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame Image, from Glory to Glory.</hi> Our Love to God works in the Soul a deſire of Union with him, and likeneſs to him which is a kind of Union: and that approximation to him doth derive from him an impreſſion of his own Nature, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto him.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The ground of our Love to God is the Senſe of that Love, that he hath ſhewen to us, 1 John. 4.19. <hi>We love him becauſe he loved us firſt,</hi> and this is a Love of Gratitude, or Thankfulneſs ariſing from the full Senſe of the undeſerved and wonderful Love of God, to his unworthy Creature revealed and diſpenſed in Jeſus Chriſt: and this cannot chuſe but put the Soul into ſuch kind of thoughts and purpoſes as theſe:
<q>O Lord, at firſt, I received my Being from thee; and when I had forfeited my Being and my Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to thee, thou waſt patient towards me, and didſt not take that forfeiture, which thou juſtly mighteſt: thou waſt merciful to me, and didſt pitty and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give me; and when I was in my Blood thou ſaidſt unto me, Live: thou was bountiful unto, and didſt not only pardon me, but reſtore me to that Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which I unthankfully loſt: and thus thou didſt without my ſeeking, even when I was Senſeleſs, and knew not my own Miſery, when I was obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and would not have it: and this thou didſt, not by an ordinary means, but thy Love did
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:50435:218"/>
ſend the Son of thy love to become my Sacrifice and my Righteouſneſs; and canſt thou require any thing of me, that can bear any proportion to ſo great Love? If thou ſhouldeſt call for that Being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, which thou haſt thus freely given me, I ſhould but return unto thee, that which is thine own: But after all this, what doſt thou require of me but to do juſtly, and love Mercy, to walk hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly with my God? Such a Service wherein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts my own Happineſs and Perfection, a confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity unto thy Beauty and Purity: If the Service, that thou ſhouldeſt have enjoyned me, had been a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice mingled with my own Diſhonour, Shame, Miſery, Ruin, thy Love to me had deſerved and commanded this from me; how much more when all thou requireſt from my Leprous Soul is but, Waſh and be clean? I will bleſs thy Name for that Love, which thou ſheweſt to me in my Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from ſo great a Death; and I will bleſs thy Name, that thou art pleaſed to injoyn thy Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſuch a Service, wherein conſiſts his Beauty and Perfection, a reaſonable Service; and that thou art pleaſed to accept that, as a Tribute unto thee, which inricheth thy Creature by paying it, even our Conformity to thy moſt Righteous and Holy Will: and I will endeavour in the whole Courſe of my Life, in the whole frame and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of my Soul, to expreſs my Thankfulneſs to thee in the watchful, univerſal, diligent, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Conformity unto that will of thine; and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be thy Name that haſt given thy poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture an opportunity of expreſſing his Senſe of thy Love in ſo reaſonable a Service.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Fear</hi> of God likewiſe cleanſeth the Heart, Pſal. 19.9. <hi>The fear of God is clean,</hi> Prov. 8.13. <hi>The fear of the Lord is to hate evil,</hi> Prov. 16.16.
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:50435:218"/>
                           <hi>By the fear of the Lord Men depart from evil.</hi> And this was <hi>Joſeph's</hi> fence againſt Temptations of all kinds. Gen. 39.9. <hi>How ſhall I do this great wickedneſs and ſin againſt the Lord:</hi> and his higheſt ſecurity to his Brethren of keeping his Promiſe, Gen 42.18. <hi>This do and live, for I fear God.</hi> Now this fear of God is wrought upon the precedent Act of Faith in a double Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: 1. As it preſents God unto the Soul in his Purity, Majeſty, Power, Juſtice, and Preſence even in the innermoſt and darkeſt Chambers of our Hearts. And this Conſideration becomes even the exacteſt Chriſtian always to have about him: for all the ſtrongeſt ingagements even upon every Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction are too little, God knows, to fence and ward the Soul againſt the Corruptions within it, and the Temptations without it. And this Conſideration will moſt opportunely beſpeak the Soul in this manner:
<q>Conſider what thou art doing: thou art now going about to purpoſe or do that which thy Creator forbids thee; and thou art in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of that God, before whom all things are naked and manifeſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.13. whoſe eyes are upon all the ways of Man, and he ſeeth all his goings, <hi>Job</hi> 32.21. and his eyes are therefore upon his ways, that he may give every Man according to his works, <hi>Job</hi> 32.18. Conſider thou art in his Preſence that is a conſuming Fire, and a jealous God <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.24. A great God, and a mighty and terrible, that regardeth not Perſons, nor taketh rewards, <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.27. That hath ſaid that, <hi>When any Man heareth the words of this Curſe, and ſhall bleſs himſelf in his Heart, ſaying, I ſhall have Peace, though I walk in the immagination of my Heart, the Lord will not ſpare him, but his jealouſie ſhall ſmoak againſt that man; Deut.</hi> 29.19 20. That hath Juſtice, and Wiſdom, and Truth, and Power enough to fulfil
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:50435:219"/>
and execute the moſt exquiſite, ſeaſonable, and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable Vengeance upon any contemner of his Will, and this is the God, whom thou, a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that art nothing in his hands, art about to offend: Conſider this, thou that forgetteſt God, leſt he tear thee in pieces, and there be none to deliver thee.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>But 2. Fear is a Fruit of Love, and though we are not to neglect the former, yet we muſt be ſure to entertain this; perfect Love caſts out fear, a fear of puniſhment, but not a fear of ſin; a fear of a Malefactor, not the fear of a Child: And upon this Conſideration this affection upon any Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thus beſpeaks the Soul:
<q>Conſider what thou art now ſetting about: It is that thy Lord, thy Redeemer, forbids thee, he that hath died for thee to reſcue thee from thy vain Converſation: how unſeemly a return is this, for ſo much Love and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as thou haſt received? how canſt thou come in thy Prayers, in thy Hopes, in thy Dependance to that God, whom, againſt the bonds of ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Gratitude, thou art now offending? how canſt thou ever expect to have the light and favour of his Countenance, whom, contrary to all thy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements of Duty and Covenant, thou art now about to injure? canſt thou profeſs thou loveſt him, whom thou dareſt to abuſe, to diſobey, even to his Face?</q>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>Hope:</hi> the Word of God hath promiſed in Chriſt Glory, and immortality, and the ſight of himſelf, to thoſe that are pure in Heart, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.8.

And from this Advantage, that the Grace of God hath over our Perfections, do ariſe theſe four Conſequents of it: 1. Univerſality of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. 2. Conſtancy in it. 3. Growth and increaſe in it. 4. Renewing of our Repentance: all which, as they are the gifts of God, ſo they do naturally flow from the over-matching of our Corruptions by Grace, as appears in theſe <hi>Particulars:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>

Whoſoever ſhall keep the whole, yet if he offend in one point, he is guilty of all, <hi>James</hi> 2.10. The Grace of God and Sin are univerſally oppoſite one to another: and as they are ſo in the abſtract, ſo are they in the concrete. Where Sin hath an advantage in the Soul, it doth oppoſe univerſally the whole Will of God: and where Grace is in the Soul, it doth oppoſe the whole will of Sin: and therefore where any one Sin or neglect of any one Command of God is entertained knowingly and adviſedly in the Soul, there the Grace of God hath not the upper hand; for the ſame Principle, by which it acts, <hi>viz.</hi> the Love of God, equally engageth the Soul to every Duty, and againſt every Sin, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the meaſure of Knowledge that is commmuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the Soul.</p>

If any quality have got the maſtery in a mixt Body, it doth ever more and more by degrees, waſte and conſume the contrary qualities, and aſſimulates the whole unto it ſelf.

Power and Efficacy of the Divine Spirit, never ſtands ſtill; but like the little Leven, that was hid in the great quantity of Meal, it never gives over till the whole be leavened.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. <hi>Renewed Repentance:</hi> Thy corrupt Nature is a Body of Sin and Death, a ſpring of Corruption, that will ever caſt up mire and dirt: and Grace in thy Heart is a ſpring of living Waters, that as often as that corrupts, will be waſhing it again. When thou haſt made the chamber of thy Heart as clean as thou canſt, yet there will be leaks in it, that will let in Corruptions enough, quickly to make it as foul as ever: Grace by the continual examination of thy ſelf, humbling of thy Heart before God, renewing thy Covenant with him, doth not only pump out the filth, that would poyſon, and drown, and dam thee, but ſtops the decays and leaks of this thy infirm Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel. When the Grace of God at firſt found thee, thou waſt dead in treſpaſſes and ſins; and it came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, and by Repentance did exerciſe its own act of Life to quicken thee: And that ſame Body of Death, that did at firſt incloſe thee, is ſtill about thee, and takes all opportunities to get its old ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of thee; and by this means, thou catcheſt many a fall and bruiſe: but that ſame Life, by which thou liveſt, re-acts againſt thoſe inroads of ſin and death, and doth conquer them; ſo that though thy renewed ſins are not thy ruine, yet they ought to be thy burden; though they muſt not make thee deſpair, yet they cannot chuſe but make thee mourn; though thy Saviour hath born their Guilt, yet it is but equal thou ſhouldeſt bear thy ſhame. When thou hadſt no Life in thee, thou couldeſt not feel thy ſelf dead: But now thou haſt Life in thee, thou canſt not chuſe but be ſenſible of thy ſickneſs and thy hurts, which thy own folly have occaſioned, and judge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn,
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:50435:224"/>
and avoid that Folly of thine that occaſioned it. Though thou canſt not be rid of thy ſins, that fight againſt thy Life, yet thou wilt not entertain them with better Entertainment, than Bread of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, and Water of Affliction. Though thou canſt not expiate for any of them, yet thou canſt not look upon them without indignation, as Traytors againſt thy Life and thy Peace; thou canſt not look upon thy ſelf, without loathing and deteſtation; thou canſt not look unto Chriſt, without ſhame and confuſion, that one that he hath redeemed from ſo great a Miſery, with ſo great a Price, to ſo great a nearneſs, as to be a member of himſelf, a partaker of his Spirit, a Co-heir of his Glory, ſhould ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily, ſo unthankfully, in his ſight, diſhonour his Head, and pollute himſelf. Thou canſt not look upon what is paſt, without Repentance, nor upon what is to come, without a Reſolution of more Vigilance, and keeping a better Guard upon thy ſelf. And yet in the midſt of all theſe thy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed thoughts, thou canſt not chuſe but admire and bleſs that Mercy of Chriſt, that when thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieſt him, looks back upon thee, as once on <hi>Peter,</hi> and with that look, ſends in a Meſſenger, that makes thee go by thy ſelf, and bewail thy Relapſe; that leaves thee not to a courſe in ſin, or to a death in ſin, but gives thee a Cordial, which though it puts thee to pain, preſerves thy Life; that though thou, like a fooliſh miſguided Sheep, art ſtragling thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt not whither, yet ſeeks thee, and finds thee, and reduceth thee; that though thou canſt ſo eaſily for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get him, yet he doth not forget thee; and when all is done, is contented to accept of that Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and that Sorrow which he himſelf gives thee, and waſhes away thy Spot by his own Blood, and
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:50435:225"/>
looks upon thee with no leſs Tenderneſs, and Love, and Compaſſion, and Goodneſs, than if thou hadſt never gone aſide.
<q>Ever bleſſed be thy Name, O merciful Lord God, that haſt redeemed us from everlaſting Death, and yet when we daily endanger our ſelves, doſt reſcue us by thy Grace; that when we ſin, thou art pleaſed not to caſt us off, but fetcheſt us in by Repentance; and when we repent, art pleaſed not to reject us, nor upbraid us with our former Falls, but accept us to Pardon and Favour; and blotteſt out our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities for thy great Names ſake: But let not thy Servants return any more to folly.</q>

Sobriety <hi>in our Judgments;</hi> which is nothing elſe, but a juſt and true <hi>Eſtimate of our ſelves,</hi> Rom. 12.3. <hi>Not to think of himſelf more highly than he ought to think, but to think ſoberly,</hi> &amp;c. Man doth naturally inordinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly love himſelf, and that love to himſelf doth miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead and inhance a Man's opinion of himſelf even by thoſe things that are meerly extrinſecal to him: he thinks the better of himſelf by reaſon of his Wealth, though that be a thing diſtinct from him by Nature, and eaſily by any caſualty ſevered from him; or by reaſon of Eſteem or Honour, though that is ſuch an acceſſion, as depends meerly upon the Will of another; for if I withdraw that honour or reſpect, which I give to a Man, he is no longer honourable to me; and as I may do it, ſo may any, and ſo may all; and then he wholly ceaſeth to be what he thought he was. And much more, Men are apt to have a high opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of themſelves in reſpect of that, which ſeems moſt their own, as Strength, Beauty, Elocution, Wit, Knowledge: and the more intimate the Perfection is unto him, that hath it, the harder it is for that Man to be brought to that due eſtimation, that he ſhould have of himſelf: that very Knowledge, which muſt be the ground of bringing him to a right eſtimation of himſelf, is ready to puff him up: and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion that ariſeth from the over-eſtimation of a Man's ſelf, and from his reflection upon that over-eſtimation, is Pride: and from this Pride ariſe thoſe other diſtempers of the inward and outward Man: a proud look, deſpiſing the weaker or inferiour; Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance, lofty, and haughty Speech, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.30. <hi>Is not this great Babylon,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.9 <hi>They ſet their mouth againſt Heaven, and their tongue walketh through the earth:</hi> Exod. 5.2. <hi>Who is the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. a placing of a Man's ſelf

Now as this proceeds much from the miſtake of our Judgment, or the want of the Exerciſe of it; ſo on the other ſide, when the judgment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a Mans ſelf is rectified, it produceth a clean contrary effect in the Soul; the Man was mad before, out of his Wits, and his Carriage and Deportment was anſwerable thereunto; but now by this right underſtanding himſelf, he is ſober, in his right Senſes, and a ſutable Deportment riſeth thereupon: he looks upon his <hi>Wealth</hi> as a thing that is lent him, depoſited with him only as a Steward, not as an Owner; as that which is uncertain, vaniſhing, ſubject to be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily tranſlated from him to another; as that which is external to him, which he may have and be a Fool, or a Man under a Curſe; as that which will one day inhance his Account, not eaſe his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; as that which he may not, it may be, keep whilſt he lives, and is ſure to loſe when he dies; as that which may be his ſnare, his Temptation, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be his Felicity; as that which though never ſo exceſſive, gives no greater a Priviledge, than it gives his Servant that eats of it, but only the bare Name of being his own: He looks upon his <hi>Eſteem, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and Honour,</hi> in the World, as that which
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:50435:227"/>
meerly depends upon his inferiors Benevolence, which thy may withdraw when they pleaſe; as that which is external alſo to him, may make him an Object of more Envy, Danger, and inſecurity; that inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to a great deal of vigilance to preſerve it, and is often loſt without deſert, and yet the Man is the ſame: He looks upon his <hi>Power and Authority</hi> as a thing that is not in himſelf, but meerly in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution of the ſtrength of others, or their volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary denying it to themſelves by a reſolution of Non-reſiſtance; as that which makes no real Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion to him, but he is but what he was before he had it, and when he loſeth it, will be what he was before he left it, in all points, ſave meerly out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide and vulgar opinion: He looks upon himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Beauty of his <hi>external Ornaments,</hi> as a little Clay dreſt up in Gallantry; that that may more juſtly make him proud that made it, than him that wears it; that alters not the Soul or Body that is under it, nor is become part of it: he looks upon his <hi>Strength or Beauty,</hi> or temperature of Body, as that which a few years will lay in the Duſt, and the Worms will maſter it; as that which is not able to conteſt with the leaſt Diſtemper, either within it, or without it; and yet the good that is in it while it laſts, is but a borrowed good: He looks upon his <hi>Knowledge, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding and Wiſdom,</hi> as that which is infinitely ſhort of what it was, or what it might be; the moſt that we know being infinitely ſhort of what we know not, and what we ſhould know: that his increaſe of Knowledge is but an increaſe of his Account, an ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of thoſe ſins, which would be of leſſer magnitude, had they not been committed againſt a greater Light; that the moſt of what we know, and that makes up the moſt of Men great in their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, is that which will be utterly unuſeful after this

I have forfeited all unto thee, but thou haſt not taken all from me: I have deſerved that thy whole fury ſhould be poured out upon me, but thou haſt afflicted me in meaſure: thou haſt left me my life, thou haſt left me my hope, thou haſt left me ſome Light of thy Countenance, which is better than my Life; thou haſt left me Liberty and Encouragement to pour out my Soul before thee, and doſt entertain it: if thou hadſt depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

And this I plainly ſee was the ſtate of my Soul: and therefore I deſire to receive theſe thy Afflictions, not only as Puniſhments, but as Medicines, as Meſſages, as well of thy care of me, and thy mercy to me, as of thy Juſtice upon me, that they may not only be an exerciſe of my Patience, but an Object of my Thankfulneſs, of my Joyful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: that they may not only be a conviction of thy Deteſtation of my ſin, but a pledge of thy Love to my Perſon: I ſhall therefore endeavour to bear thy hand as becomes me with Patience, becauſe I deſerve them; with Thankfulneſs, becauſe they are moderate; and with Comfort, becauſe they are thy Miniſters, ſent me for my good: and as I ſhall thus learn to entertain them, ſo I ſhall endeavour to uſe and improve them to that end thou ſendeſt them, to take me off from the World, to bring me nearer to thee, that I may live more by Faith than

Senſe, and to make me more exact and watchful than before, Pſal. 119.67. <hi>Before I was afflicted, I went aſtray, but now have I kept thy word:</hi>
                           </q>
In the midſt of thy Glory, Honour, Wealth, Preferment, Provocations from Men, Injuries and Scorns, it will keep thee from ſwelling, looking big upon thy infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, or thoſe that have Dependance upon thee, or uſe of thee: It will take thee off from Vain-Glory, Revenge, Envy, Diſdain, and ſuch like Diſtempers; all which proceed from a miſ-underſtanding of a Mans ſelf: It will make thee and keep thee meek, gentle, affable, eaſie to be intreated, long-ſuffering, pittiful; all which are the Fruits of the Spirit wrought in the heart, by this Sobriety or right judgment of our ſelves, <hi>Galat.</hi> 5.22. which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour commended to all his Diſciples, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.1. by the condition of a little Child, wherein Pride is not grown up, though it be there in the Seed: for all theſe Diſtempers riſe from an opinion of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter worth, merit, or excellence, in a Mans ſelf, than in another, which a ſober Man, that hath a right judgment of himſelf, finds quite otherwiſe. And from this Sobriety ariſing upon a right judgment concerning our ſelves will ariſe a Behaviour, Carria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and Speech anſwerable: it will be ſutable to our Nature, and the Station, Condition, and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in or about which we are, not arrogant, giddy, haughty, light, vain; but humble, ſetled, grave, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Sobriety in reference to <hi>our ſenſual Appetite,</hi> and thoſe Paſſions or Motions which ariſe in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to it. As the firſt part of Religion conſiſts in the Conformity and Subjection of our Reaſon to the Will and Truth of God; ſo the ſecond part of it conſiſts in the Conformity of our ſenſual Appetite to Reaſon, thus rectified: Now the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:50435:229"/>
Appetite is divided in reſpect of her Objects and her motion towards them, into the Concupiſcible, which is the Motion of the ſenſual Nature to thoſe things, which tend to the Preſervation of it ſelf and kind by Deſire: or the Iraſcible, which is the aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from, or Motion of the ſenſual Nature againſt thoſe things that are prejudicial, or ſo apprehended.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Concupiſcible</hi> Appetite is that Motion of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which tends to its own own Preſervation, or to the Preſervation of its kind, or thoſe things that are in order to both, <hi>viz.</hi> Wealth and Power.</p>
                        <p>The Firſt of theſe is the deſire of Eating and Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Exceſs whereof is <hi>Luxury.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Second is the deſire of Propagation of the kind, the Exceſs whereof is <hi>Luſt,</hi> or Wantonneſs.</p>
                        <p>The Third is the deſire of thoſe Supplies, which conduce to the ſupplying of both, <hi>viz.</hi> deſire of Wealth, the exceſs whereof is <hi>Covetouſneſs;</hi> and the deſire of Power to defend our ſelves, the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs whereof is <hi>Ambition:</hi> and theſe I likewiſe place in the ſenſual Appetite, becauſe they are in order to the immediate Objects thereof, and we find them, though not in ſo exact a degree, even in Beaſts.</p>
                        <p>Concerning theſe ſomewhat hath formerly paſſed, therefore in general touching the two former we ſay,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That theſe natural inclinations or deſires are in themſelves good, and ſuch as were planted in our Nature by the holy God, and ſuch as are conduci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to good ends, <hi>viz.</hi> the Preſervation and ſupport of our Nature and Kind; and the Motions of our Nature are ſuch as proceed from that Commiſſion which God gave to the Creature, Gen. 1.28. <hi>Be fruitful, and multiply, and repleniſh the Earth,</hi> and Gen. 2.17. <hi>Of every tree of the Garden thou mayſt freely e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>

                           <pb n="422" facs="tcp:50435:230"/>
both which Commiſſions were again renewed and enlarged, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.13.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That we are not allowed only the uſe of thoſe inclinations of our Nature for Neceſſity, but alſo for Delight, ſo as the Preſcriptions here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aftermentioned be obſerved, Deut. 12.15. <hi>Thou mayſt kill and eat fleſh in all thy Gates whatſoever thy Soul luſteth after, according to the bleſſing of the Lord thy God,</hi> Deut. 28.47. <hi>Becauſe thou ſervedſt not God with joyful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and gladneſs of heart for the abundance of all things,</hi> &amp;c. Prov. 5.18. <hi>Rejoyce with the Wife of thy youth.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. The ſin or obliquity that happens in theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations of our Nature, or the uſe of them, is when they become inordinate Affections, <hi>viz.</hi> out of that due Order or Poſition that God hath placed them in us:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. When either the Motion of theſe Appetites, or the exerciſe of them, is without a due Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to Reaſon, which God hath placed in a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior Authority in Man above this Appetite: In bruit Beaſts, their ſenſitive Appetite is their higheſt faculty, and it knows no other Moderator than that very Appetite that God hath placed in them: but in Man he hath placed a higher Nature, and therefore the actings of the ſenſitive Appetite with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this Subordination to this higher Nature, is in truth in Man unnatural, and contrary to the Order and Courſe of Nature. This concerns us as we are Men.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. When either this Motion, or the Actings of it, are contrary to the Mind and Will of God: for this ought to be the guide of our Reaſon, as that ought to be the guide of our Appetite. And this concerns us as we are Men enlightned with the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and quickned with the Love of God.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="423" facs="tcp:50435:230"/>Now for want of theſe, the ſins or obliquities that happen in our ſenſitive Appetites, are when they are acted either inconſiderately, immoderately, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonably.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Inconſiderately,</hi> when in the uſe of the Creatures, in reference to thoſe inclinations of the ſenſitive Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, we conſider not the End, for which we have them, nor uſe them in order to that End; to eat, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we will eat, and not becauſe we would be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained; or conſider not the Hand from which we receive them, that we may uſe them thankfully; nor the Preſence of Almighty God, who obſerves all our carriage in the uſe of his Bleſſings, that ſo we may uſe them ſoberly and reverently.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Immoderately:</hi> There is required of us a double Moderation in the uſe of this Faculty: 1. Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Affection to the Object: 2. Moderation in the uſe of the Object of our Appetite. The want of the former, robs God of that Affection, or mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Love, which we owe to him: When any thing is loved beyond the proportion or meaſure due to it, it muſt needs invade the Love a Man ows to God, and ſo places that Object in the place of God. Thus Covetouſneſs becomes Idolatry, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.5. Gluttony becomes Idolatry; <hi>Whoſe God is their Belly:</hi> For that which hath the maſtery of our Love, hath the command of the whole Man: and if my Love to the Objects of my ſenſual Appetite want that due ſubordination to the Love I owe to God, or exceed that due proportion that I owe to them; when any ſervice I owe to God, or any office I owe to Man, comes in competition with the ſatisfaction of my ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual Appetite, I ſhall neglect the Duty I owe to God or Man. The want of the latter, is when we uſe them in ſuch a meaſure, as is either beyond the convenience of our Nature, or beyond the conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:50435:231"/>
of our Condition: the former is Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and deſtroys the Body; the latter is Prodiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity or Profuſeneſs, and waſtes the Eſtate: the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of God's Providence in Externals, ought to be the meaſure at leaſt, beyond which, we muſt not go in the uſe of Meats and Drink. Again, under this Rule, is prohibited the making Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for the Fleſh, exciting the Appetite beyond its natural diſpoſition by Meats, Drinks, and Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſeaſonably:</hi> This, though it exclude not the conſiderations of the places where, and Perſons with whom we converſe, yet it principally looks upon the time of our action, as that ſtands qualified or cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantiated. God hath allowed me a comfortable and liberal uſe of his Creatures, as well for Delight as Neceſſity; but uſe not that liberty upon theſe Seaſons: 1. When God's Providence hath ſet a mark of Sadneſs upon the Seaſon, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22.12. <hi>In that day did the Lord of hoſts call to weeping and to mourning, and behold joy and gladneſs,</hi> &amp;c. 2. When either God by his Word, or Civil or Eccleſiaſtical Conſtitutions or Cuſtoms, or thy own particular Dedication hath ſet apart a time for religious Abſtinence or Duty: 3. When the ordinary occaſions of thy Profeſſion, Calling, or temporal Employment, permit it not without inconvenience to thy ſelf or others.</p>
                        <p>In order to our ſenſual Appetite, are thoſe Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions which are carried towards thoſe things that are ſubſervient thereunto: and theſe Affections we find in the Bruit Creatures: <hi>The Ants, a people not ſtrong, yet gather they their meat in ſummer,</hi> Prov. 30.25. And from the ſame proceeds their deſire of maſtery one over another. As the former is for Proviſion for their Appetites, ſo the latter is for their Protection of that Proviſion, or themſelves, in their acquiring
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:50435:231"/>
a uſe of it: Anſwerable to which in Man are thoſe two Deſires, of Wealth, which we call Covetouſneſs, and of Power, which we call Ambition. Neither of theſe but is converſant about thoſe things, which are meerly uſeful, either for the Supplies of the ſenſual Appetite, or protection of thoſe Supplies in us, or our Poſterity.</p>
                        <p>Touching thoſe Deſires, we ſay, as of the former, that they are not in themſelves unlawful: for as the Divine Diſpenſations hath appointed our natural Life to be ſupported and defended by theſe external Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions; ſo he hath diſperſed thoſe ſupplies in the World, and given us Appetites to them, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed means to acquire them: They are his Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, and we are commanded to be induſtrious in ſerving of the Divine Providence in the acquiring of theſe things, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.18. <hi>It is he that giveth thee power to get wealth.</hi> Deut. 28.8, &amp;c. <hi>He ſhall command the bleſſing upon thee in thy ſtore-houſes, he ſhall make thee plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in goods, the Lord ſhall make thee the head, and not the tail.</hi> Prov. 6.6. the wiſe Man ſendeth the Slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Ant; and it pleaſed God oftentimes to give unto thoſe, who were his ſincere Servants, a great meaſure both of Wealth and Honour; and a lawful and ſober Induſtry to acquire them is not only permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but commanded and injoyned: <hi>He that provideth not for his own houſe, is worſe than an infidel.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Errors concerning theſe Affections are as in the former,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Inconſiderateneſs</hi> in the proſecution and uſe of them: Theſe things are not deſirable for themſelves, but in order to ſomething elſe; and they are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves more remote from our Nature than the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Objects of our Senſes, and yet we are not to deſire them for their own ſakes, but in order to that End, for which that Deſire is put into us, <hi>viz.</hi> the
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:50435:232"/>

It is more diſtant and remote from the neceſſity of my Nature to be rich, than to be fed; yet both are but inſtrumental, though in a different order, and therefore muſt be ſo deſired and proſecuted. And as this conſideration is to be in the gaining of Wealth, ſo it muſt be in the uſe of it: <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us of this Vanity, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 6.2. A Man to whom God hath given Riches, Wealth, and Honour, ſo that he wanteth nothing of all that his Soul deſireth, yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof: As <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ.</hi> 4.8. there was no end of his Labour, neither was his Eye ſatisfied with Riches in his purſuit of them, ſo he makes not that rational uſe of them for which they were given: he deſired to be rich, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would be rich; and being arrived to his End, he cannot find in his Heart to employ them to thoſe Ends, for which alone they are only valuable.

                        <p n="1">1. <hi>In our Care:</hi> This proceeds from our Infidelity and Diſtruſt of God's All-ſufficience. When we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider not that the Diſpenſation of things convenient for our Life is in his hands, and that the accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of them to our uſe is from the Word or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion that he gives them: <hi>Man lives not by bread only, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God:</hi> Matth. 4.4. It is from his hand that thou muſt expect thy Bread, and thy Clothing, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.20. <hi>If God give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on:</hi> and it is from his Bleſſing and the Commiſſion, which he gives to that Bread and that Raiment, that he gives thee, to be uſeful for thee, and accommodate to this Preſervation. And this Solicitouſneſs, Care, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt, our Saviour forbiddeth and convinceth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.25. <hi>Take no thought for your life;</hi> 52. <hi>for your heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father knoweth you have need of theſe things:</hi> Thy Care is but a tormenting Care; it is but an unuſeful and unprofitable Care: Thou canſt not by thy Care add to thy own Stature: It is an impertinent Care, and a Care that belongs to another: thy heavenly Father knoweth thou haſt need of all theſe things: he is thy Father, and therefore is willing to furniſh thee with what ſhall be convenient for thee; and he is thy Heavenly Father, that wants not Power to do it: he can ſupply thee in the ordinary way of his Providence: and, if there be need, he can do it by the extraordinary work of his Power: he can command Water out of a dry Rock, as to the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> or out of a dry Bone, as to <hi>Samſon:</hi> he can give thee Bread

from Heaven; he can feed <hi>Elijah</hi> by a Raven: and can extend the Widows Barrel of Meal and Cruiſe of Oyl, as large as the time and exigence of her Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity. Save thy ſelf therefore the trouble of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary Care, but commit thy way unto the Lord: Truſt alſo in him, and he ſhall bring it to paſs. Thy Care may rob thy ſelf of thy quietneſs, and may rob thy God of his due; but it is thy Dependance only upon him, that can with eaſe and contentedneſs ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply thy wants: Diligence and Induſtry in that law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Employment, wherein his Providence hath pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced thee, is thy Duty, and therefore obſerve it: but Sollicitouſneſs and Anxiouſneſs is thy Sin, and therefore avoid it: Learn to obey him in what he commands; and learn to wait upon him in what he promiſes.</p>

And thus the Love of the World is the root of all evil: for as all the Good in Man, is the Conformity to the Will of God, ſo whatſoever interrupts this Conformity, muſt needs be an original of Evil: and this is done by the Love of the World, which makes a Man reject this Conformity, when it is inconſiſtent with that imperious Love of the World.</p>

But this is not all; though the gain of Eternity would infinitely over-weigh the loſs of thoſe Temporals, which it may be in this time, thou mighteſt have gotten; yet thou muſt know, thou ſerveſt ſuch a Maſter, that whilſt thou obeyeſt him in ſeeking thy chiefeſt good in the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt place, will not only give thee that Eternity which thou thus ſeekeſt, but will add unto thee the things of this Life, which yet thou neglecteſt: And whiles he gives thee that great and everlaſting Treaſure, which he commands thee to ſeek, will not deprive thee of

It were but equal, if he that is the Lord of <hi>our</hi> Times and of <hi>our</hi> Lives, ſhould require all our Time in his own immediate Service: but when he allows us unto our own occaſions, the greateſt part of our time, wherein we may do all that we have to do, and requires a ſmall portion of our time for his immediate ſervice, and that alſo for our own ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting advantage, it is the higheſt ſacriledge to God, and injury to our ſelves, to ſteal that from him, which, while we do it, we rob our ſelves. I thank God, I ever found, that in the ſtricteſt obſervation of the times of his Worſhip, I ever met with the beſt Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to my worldly Occaſions, and that when ever my worldly Occaſions incroached upon thoſe times, I ever met with diſappointment, though in things of the moſt hopeful and probable ſucceſs.

God hath not given over his care of me. It would be a ſad preſage unto me, of the ſevere anger of my Maker, if my inadvertence ſhould caſt me upon a temporal Undertaking upon his Day, and that it ſhould proſper.

The Habit it ſelf, or habitual Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. 2. The Rule of it. 3. The Parts of it.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>The Habit</hi> it ſelf: it is a frame and temper of Mind ariſing from the Love of God, to give every Man his due, according to the Will of God. The great Duty that the Creature owes to his Creator, is Love: <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord with all thy Heart:</hi> and this as hath been ſhewn, is the firſt and great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, and the firſt and moſt natural Duty and Bond that can be: the <hi>Conſequence</hi> of this Love, is the doing all the good we can unto him, and for him, from whom we receive our Being: now all the good we can do him, is but to pleaſe him, to be conformable to his Will; for it is impoſſible, that any thing can contribute any thing to him, that is infinitely full: all the good we can do him therefore, and all the expreſſions of our Love, conſiſts in this,
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:50435:237"/>
                           <hi>viz.</hi> A free ſubjection and obedience to his Will. And becauſe we find this Righteouſneſs, and Juſtice, and Love to our Neighbour, is commanded by him, and is evidenced to his Will, both by that natural inclination that he hath put in us, by the diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Providence, whereby he makes every Man uſeful and beneficial to another in this way of mutual Juſtice, and by his written Word, whereby he expreſly requires it; this Cardinal and fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal motion of the Soul, <hi>viz.</hi> the Love of God, doth preſently conclude, that ſince that great God to whom I owe my ſelf, and all my Love, and all my Obedience, requires this duty at my hands, though I could ſee no reaſon for it, I would preſently ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit unto much more, when there is ſo much reaſon for it, as indeed God doth not require my Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in any thing, but if it be well conſidered, is moſt admirably conſonant to ſound Reaſon, and to my own advantage; <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Keep therefore, and do them, for this is your wiſdom and your underſtanding in the ſight of the nations:</hi> ſo that the foundation of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual Righteouſneſs is Love to God; the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of that Love to God is a rational, univerſal, and voluntary Obedience to his Will and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; the Command of God, next to Love to himſelf, is to love our Neighbours; the expreſſion of that Love is in acts of Righteouſneſs and Juſtice to them: hence it is called the ſecond great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, the great Injunction that Chriſt gave to his followers, the fulfilling of the whole Law.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 <hi>The Rule</hi> of Righteouſneſs: In our original Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, God gave unto Man a Rule of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by the immediate impreſſion and revelation of his own Mind unto him, and inclination to ſubmit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="437" facs="tcp:50435:237"/>
yet was not wholly taken away by his Fall. So much was by the Divine Providence conveyed from Man to Man as left the Offender without excuſe. But as the River ran farther from the Fountain; ſo it became more foul and polluted, the ſins of Men conteſting with, and corrupting by degrees that tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional Righteouſneſs, which was derived from Man to Man: But the merciful God was pleaſed, as the ſins and corruptions of Mankind did make breaches into this Rule of Righteouſneſs, and corrupted the manners of Men; ſo he was pleaſed in the ways of his Providence, to repair it in ſome meaſure in all Ages, raiſing up Prophets and Preachers of Righteouſneſs, as <hi>Noah</hi> was to the old World, exciting, and by his power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and wiſe Spirit, enabling Men to make Laws and Conſtitutions in States and Kingdoms, which though they were not of his own immediate dictating, yet he attributes too little to the Wiſdom and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, that doth attribute the inventing and compoſing of thoſe uſeful and righteous Laws, even among the Heathen, to the meer Wiſdom and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of Men; when he himſelf leads us up unto himſelf, even in the low Projections of the Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.26. <hi>For his God doth inſtruct him to diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and doth teach him.</hi> It is true, that there is a kind of natural Conſonancy of the Rules of Juſtice and Righteouſneſs to the well being of Men, and Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Men; as is moſt evident, both where that Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice is, and where it is not; and by the obſervation of the now aged World, and of the ſucceſs and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Mankind, much may be collected both of the Neceſſity of Righteouſneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and of the Parts and Particulars wherein it conſiſts: But God yet more careful of his Creature, hath not left us to our own Collections, wherein the varieties of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,

the growth of Sin and Corruptions, and our own Blindneſs may deceive us, or perplex us, but hath given us <hi>a written Rule</hi> of Righteouſneſs, the Word of the Old and New Teſtaments. <hi>He hath ſhewed thee, O man, what is good,</hi> Micah 6.8. <hi>Deute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronom.</hi> 30.14. <hi>The word is very nigh thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayeſt do it:</hi> Now <hi>the Word of God</hi> is conſiderable as a Rule of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Abſolutely, and in it ſelf: and therein it is conſiderable, how the Law Moral, Ceremonial, and Judicial alone, or joyned with the Expoſitions and Counſels of the Goſpel, are a Rule of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Relatively: and thus the Word of God ſends us to two other, but ſubordinate Rules:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Subjection</hi> to <hi>Humane Laws: Be obedient to every Ordinance of Man for Conſcience ſake,</hi> 1. Pet. 2.13.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Conſcience</hi> in that great Rule, <hi>Whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do unto you, that do you unto them.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. The firſt Conſideration: <hi>the Scripture,</hi> as it is the Rule of all Divine Truth, ſo it is a perfect Rule of Righteouſneſs, both towards God and Man, 2 <hi>Tim</hi> 3.16. <hi>All Scripture is given by inſpiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, for inſtruction in Righteouſneſs, that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furniſhed to every good work.</hi> There wants nothing in the Rule to acquire Perfection, though by reaſon of the defect in the ſubject, it cannot be attained.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The Law of God is a Rule of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>viz. the Moral Law.</hi> It is true, in theſe two <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is not binding <hi>to the Gentiles</hi> as a Covenant: for ſo it was in a particular manner given to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and not to the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> The External Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant on the Peoples part, was an Obedience to the whole Law, given by <hi>Moſes;</hi> the Covenant on God's part, was to be their God, and bleſs them. And this, as it was never a Covenant between God and other Nations, till incorporated into that Society, ſo alſo as a Covenant, it was abrogated by Chriſt, who came to make a New Covenant between God and Man; <hi>New,</hi> not in the purpoſe of God, for it was his purpoſe from all Eternity; nor yet in the Subſtance and Efficacy of it, for the whole Frame of the Law, and of all thoſe Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, were in order to Chriſt, and the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to them, received their acception in him; but <hi>New</hi> in the manner of the exhibition, the Subſtance it ſelf was unvailed, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt, the manner of partaking of his Benefit, more clearly diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>viz.</hi> Faith: ſo then the ſubſtantial Covenant with the <hi>Jews</hi> under the Law, and ſince the coming of Chriſt, is one and the ſame, Chriſt Jeſus; the manner of the exhibition or external manifeſtation thereof under the Law, was as a Covenant of Works, which is ſince rather expired, than abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, for the prefixed time, which God in his Wiſdom and Providence had pre-determined, expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the promulgation of that ſubſtantial Sacrifice, Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The Moral Law, as it was promulged and given to that People, doth not bind farther than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of the Judicial or Ceremonial Law: and therefore extends not farther than the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth: But as that Law ſo promulged, did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that Natural Rectitude, which was once given
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:50435:239"/>
unto all Mankind, ſo it binds us, and is a Rule of Righteouſneſs to us: and though that enacting of it among the <hi>Jews,</hi> is not the formal cauſe of its Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation upon us <hi>Gentiles;</hi> yet it doth ſerve as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation or manifeſtation of it, and leaves even that part of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> unto whom it came, more unexcuſable in its diſobedience, becauſe by a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation from Heaven, and by the Diſpenſation of his Providence, it is moſt clearly manifeſted unto them.</p>
                        <p>So then queſtionleſs, the Moral Law, though gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the <hi>Jews,</hi> is a Rule of Righteouſneſs to all, becauſe it contains thoſe Precepts, that are naturally and intrinſecally Good, and Right, and Juſt for all Men to obſerve. And though Chriſt came to take it away, as a Covenant of Works, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the condemning power of it, which was the Enmity, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.17. yet he came not to take it away, as a Rule of Righteouſneſs: Thus Heaven and Earth ſhall firſt paſs away, before one jot, or tittle of the Law ſhall paſs away, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.18. And we ſee plainly that the Saviour of the World, his Preſcriptions of Holineſs, doth not only rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force the Law, but ſuperadds a more ſpiritual, pure, and high Obſervation, than the Letter it ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. He came to aboliſh the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Law, not as things unholy in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, but as uſeleſs, becauſe the Subſtance was come: He came to take away the Curſe of the Law from ſuch as believe, by ſatisfying for it; and the Condemning Power of the Law, in caſe of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault of an exact Obedience by fulfilling it for us: But he took it not away, as a Rule to guide us; for thus the Apoſtle witneſſeth to it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.12. that it is Holy, Juſt, and Good; and diſobedience to it,
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:50435:239"/>
is a mortal ſin in it ſelf, though by the Satisfaction of Chriſt, it is become not deadly to them: Every Sin we commit againſt this Righteous Rule, even after our Converſion, requires the Blood of the Son of God to waſh it away, otherwiſe it were deadly. We have a double Obligation to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law, as a Rule of our Obedience, 1. As it is a Rule of natural Juſtice: 2. As it is inforced, and as it were re-enacted by the Command of our Saviour.</p>
                        <p>Now as touching <hi>the Ceremonial Law,</hi> though in particular, and the matter of it, it be ſo far from a Rule of Righteouſneſs to us, that it were an act of higheſt injury to our Saviour, to practiſe it, yet there wants not an uſe of it, eſpecially amongſt others in theſe particulars: 1. That an exact preciſe Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is required where God commands, though we ſee not, it may be, the particular Reaſon: the very Snuffers, and Coverings, and Times, and all other Circumſtances muſt be exactly obſerved. When God commands, there is no diſputing of, or varying from his Injunctions: 2. That in all our approaches to the moſt holy God, we muſt endeavour to bring our Conſciences, and Hearts, and Lives as clean as may be: he is a holy God, and will be ſanctified by all them that draw near to him: And this was meant by their waſhings, and purifyings, and clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings in caſes of even natural defilements. 3. That he is a God that is pleaſed with Order, Decency, and Comelineſs in his Service, ſo as it be agreeable to his own Word and Will, without Idolatrous Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions or Will-worſhip.</p>
                        <p>And as to <hi>the Judicial Law,</hi> though in the Letter of it, it was the Law for that People, yet it doth doth contain an exemplary Wiſdom and Juſtice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:50435:240"/>
that theſe Laws, that were not particularly fitted for that Nation, and the Circumſtances of their Condition, may be Examples and Patterns for the Laws of other States; and do include a great deal of natural Juſtice and Righteouſneſs; yet the expreſs Text of the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial Law, did not ſerve in all caſes emergent in that Common-Wealth, eſpecially concerning tranſlations of Properties and Intereſt. And in theſe the Civil Magiſtrate did determine according to the Rules of natural Juſtice and Convenience of the Common-Wealth, and by the extraordinary direction and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of God, <hi>vide</hi> Exod. 18.26.</p>
                        <p>And as thus the Laws of the <hi>Jews,</hi> contained Rules and Directions in Natural Juſtice between Man and Man; ſo the <hi>ſacred Hiſtory,</hi> the Directions of <hi>the Prophets,</hi> ſupply us with farther manifeſtation of the Will of God in the matters of Juſtice between Man and Man: and do enforce them home upon the Conſcience. When we ſee that great obſervation the Almighty God takes of the juſt or unjuſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of Men by his imminent Judgments and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, which we find in the ſacred Hiſtory, attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either practice, whereby he owns even Civil Juſtice to be as it were his Creature, and doth Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronize and maintain it: ſuch were his Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions upon breach of Covenant with the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. upon Murder and Oppreſſion in <hi>Ahab,</hi> and in his Houſe, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.19. upon Cruelty and Ambition in the Poſterity of <hi>Jehu, Hoſ.</hi> 1.4. of Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery and Murder in <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. with divers other inſtances of the like kind, do practically con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince that Righteouſneſs between Man and Man, is a thing required, aſſerted, maintained, and the breach thereof avenged by the hand of God himſelf, when the Potency of the Offenders ſeem to exempt them
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:50435:240"/>
from his inſtrumental Vindication, exerciſed by Men in an ordinary courſe of Juſtice.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The Goſpel</hi> contains a moſt excellent Rule of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs: 1. In <hi>the Example of Chriſt,</hi> one of whoſe Ends in aſſuming of our Fleſh, was to exhibit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Pattern of Holineſs towards God, and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs towards Man. And thus the Hiſtory of our Saviour's Life is a Rule of Righteouſneſs in his Meekneſs, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.29. <hi>Learn of me, for I am meek:</hi> in his Humility, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Let the ſame mind be in you, as was in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> &amp;c. in his Patience under Affliction or Perſecution, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.11, 12, 13. <hi>Becauſe Chriſt hath alſo ſuffered for us, leaving us an example; who when he was reviled, reviled not,</hi> &amp;c. in Offices of Love and Charity towards our Brethren, <hi>John</hi> 13.14, 15. <hi>For I have given you an example, that ye ſhould do as I have done:</hi> in love and tenderneſs towards others, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.12. <hi>Be ye followers of God as dear children, and walk in love, as Chriſt alſo hath loved us,</hi> &amp;c. in Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Parents, to Magiſtrates, in Liberality, in Compaſſion, in ſweetneſs of Converſation; in a word, we may in his Life, find not only that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Conformity to the Divine Law, that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of us; but alſo a radical, habitual frame of Mind and Life in all Vertue: ſo that we may plainly ſee in the comparing of his Life, with theſe Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Precepts and Directions contained in the Epiſtles, that the former was as it were the Text, and the latter, but Collections, or Animadverſions upon it, turning the practice of his Life into Precepts, and concluding what we ought to be, by obſerving what he was and did. God intending to re-inſtamp his Image upon Man, did ſend his Son, the Image of the inviſible God, as a Seal into the World, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print upon his Followers the Image of God, which
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:50435:241"/>
conſiſted in Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs. As in our Conformity to the Life of Chriſt, conſiſts our Righteouſneſs here; ſo ſhall our Glory be hereafter, for we know, that when he ſhall appear, we ſhall be like him.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. As thus the Hiſtory of Chriſt contains a Rule and Pattern of Righteouſneſs, ſo do <hi>the Precepts and Counſels</hi> of the Goſpel contain a Rule of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and that more excellent than the Law: and that eſpecially in theſe particulars:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. In that it teacheth and infuſeth the true Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of all Righteouſneſs, by ſhewing us the Love of God to us, and therewith commandeth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by begetteth Love to God again; and in that Love, and from it, doth teach and enable us to all the Duties of Righteouſneſs towards Men; it diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a greater and higher act of God's Love to us, than the Law did, becauſe it diſcovers his Gifts of Chriſt unto us, and with, and in him all things: and it doth more diſtinctly inform us in that Principle of Righteouſneſs in, and from the Love of God.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. It diſcovers more effectual Motives and Incite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments unto this and all other duties, in reſpect of our ſelves: The Law, having a ſhadow of good things to come, did inforce its Obedience, by Promiſes of Temporal Advantages, and Threatnings of Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Puniſhments; but the Promiſes of the Goſpel and its Threatnings are of a higher and more operative nature, <hi>viz.</hi> Eternal Life and Eternal Wrath.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. It doth improve the Commands and Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Law to its proper, yet ſpiritual and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime Senſe: for the Commands or Prohibitions of the Law, ſeemed to reſpect more principally the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Act; and though in truth it looked farther, for the Law in ſpiritual, yet the extent of it was not ſo
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:50435:241"/>
clearly evidenced, till our Saviours Divine Comment upon it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. It doth ſuperadd many Precepts, not only of Righteouſneſs towards God, but even of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs towards Man, that were not contained, or at leaſt, not ſo explicitly and poſitively as in the Goſpel: ſuch are Works of Mercy and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, Patience in Perſecution, Liberality towards others, loving our Enemies, abſtinence from Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, Gentleneſs, Moderation, and right placing of our Affections, contempt of the World, Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and the like. Theſe, though we find them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in the paſſages of the Prophets and Pſalms; yet they are not ſo diſtinctly delivered, nor ſo bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and peremptorily injoyned, till we come to the Doctrine of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, who have put an equal neceſſity upon his Diſciples to obſerve theſe, as thoſe other Injunctions of the mere Law. The Phariſees, whoſe exact and rigid obedience to the Commands of the Law, was their ſtudy and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, yet our Saviour tells his Diſciples, That except their Righteouſneſs exceed that of the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, they can in no wiſe be his Diſciples, nor enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.20. Now this exceeding of their Righteouſneſs conſiſted in this, that is before obſerved: 1. In an Obedience to the Commands of the Law in the ſpiritual intention and application of it: 2. In the practice of thoſe Vertues, which came not under the Letter of the Law, unto which he had before annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Beatitudes; Poverty of Spirit, Mourning, Meekneſs, Hungring after Righteouſneſs, Purity, Peace-making, Patience in Perſecution. And in theſe four Particulars, eſpecially the Rule of Righteouſneſs contained in the Goſpel, I cannot ſay exceeded the Law, but exceeded the manner or clearneſs of the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:50435:242"/>
of the Law; it having been the method of Almighty God ever ſince the Fall of Man, to make ſeveral <hi>ſteps of diſcoveries</hi> of his mind unto Man, and the latter, to contain a more eminent degree of Light than the former: in <hi>Abraham</hi> and the Patriarchs was one ſtep, in the Law, a ſecond, in the coming of Chriſt in the Fleſh, a third, and in the ſending of the Holy Ghoſt, a fourth: and yet all contained one and the ſame truth, but different degrees of manifeſtation.</p>
                        <p>And as in theſe Particulars, the Rule of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs contained in the New Teſtament, was more clear and excellent than that of the Law, ſo in the ſame and other reſpects, it infinitely outgoes all the Rules and Dictates of Righteouſneſs contained in the Philoſophers, whoſe Rules were Traditions, which God by his Providence conveyed from Age to Age, for the ordering and governing of Mankind, and thoſe improved by the Wiſdom, and ſevere and poliſhed Judgments of Men, to whom God had given a great meaſure of Reaſon and Truth, to whom he gave ſo much Light, as might leave the World unexcuſable in their diſobedience, yet reſerved ſo much from them as might glorifie his Son to be one that was a Teacher ſent from God, and none taught like him.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XXX.</hi> Of the general Precepts of Righteouſneſs given by Chriſt: and <hi>1.</hi> Loving our Neighbour as our ſelf.</head>
                        <p>NOW as in our Duty towards God, Chriſt doth not only deliver unto us many ſpecial and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Duties, but alſo delivers ſome ſhort general Precepts, which are eaſie to be remembred, and do include our whole Duty to God: As that of <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.37. <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart,</hi> &amp;c. ſo in the matters of Righteouſneſs and Juſtice <hi>towards Men,</hi> he doth not only deliver ſome ſpecial and explicite Duties, but hath given us ſome <hi>general Precepts,</hi> from whence a good Conſcience may eaſily deduce Concluſions applicable to every particular Action and Occaſion of our Lives in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to others: Theſe are <hi>principally</hi> two, <hi>viz.</hi> that of <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.39. taken out of <hi>Leviticus</hi> 19.18. and again enforced by the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelf:</hi> and that other, which is but a repetition of the former in different words, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.12. <hi>Therefore all things whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do to you, do ye even ſo to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets:</hi> It is a certain Rule, and eaſily applicable to every Action of our Lives: becauſe if a Man will not wilfully blind himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he is able to judge whether the Action he now doth or reſolveth,
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:50435:243"/>
be ſuch as he would be contented ſhould be done to him, were the Perſons and conditions changed.</p>
                        <p>And becauſe theſe two great Rules are the beſt and cleareſt direction of our Conſciences, and the Conſcience is not regular, where it is not confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to theſe Rules, we ſhall examine them more particularly.</p>
                        <p>Then as to <hi>the firſt, Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf,</hi> wherein we muſt take this word <hi>Neighbour,</hi> as our Saviour himſelf expounds it, that it includes every Perſon, of what Relation, or Condition ſoever, though a Perſon is my Enemy, therefore <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.43. our Saviour confutes that falſe Gloſs of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Maſters, that did contradiſtinguiſh a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to an Enemy, and tells us, that an Enemy is to be the Object of our Love and Beneficence, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.33. a <hi>Jew</hi> and a <hi>Samaritane,</hi> between whom there was not only a kind of civil and national Enmity, but an Hatred grounded upon difference in Religion, in ſo much, that the <hi>Jews</hi> could not uſe a more bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reproach againſt our Saviour, than to ſtile him a <hi>Samaritan, John</hi> 8.48. yet theſe were within the comprehenſion of this Command: So that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he be, whether knit unto me in any relation, or not, nay, though extreamly contrary unto me either in civil Enmity, or in Religion, yet ſuch a Perſon is the ſubject of this Command. This being premiſed, theſe things are evidently conſequent upon this Command:
<list>
                              <item>1. That every Man is bound to love himſelf:</item>
                              <item>2. That every Man is bound to love another, as he loves himſelf.</item>
                           </list>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">
                           <pb n="449" facs="tcp:50435:243"/>1. Concerning the former, it is certainly a Duty; and if it were not, a Man might eaſily elude this Precept: for if I might hate my ſelf, the rule and meaſure of my Love to my Neighbour were loſt; therefore a Love to my ſelf, is implicitly injoyned in this Precept of our Saviour, as well as in the Inclination of Nature, <hi>Epheſ</hi> 5.29. <hi>No man ever hated his own fleſh:</hi> but the <hi>Errors of Self-love</hi> are that which our Saviour elſewhere ſo often reproves:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. When a Man miſtakes, and eſteems that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, which indeed is not; when a Man takes that for an Eye, or a Hand, or a Foot, <hi>viz.</hi> parts of himſelf, which indeed are not, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.29. When a Man ſhall make the luſt of his Eye, as dear as his Eye; and the corruption of his Hand, as dear as his Hand: to theſe our Saviour commands cruelty to be ſhewn, to be cut off, and pulled out: when a Man ſhall miſtake that old Man that is in him, to be him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, which is to be put off and crucified, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.22. and ſhall take thoſe to be members of himſelf, which are members of the old Man, which are not to be loved, but mortified, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.5. Such is the diſorder and corruption of our Nature, that we eſteem our Sins and Luſts to be part of our Eſſentials, and thereby miſplace our Love upon them, in ſtead of our ſelves. And this is a Self Love forbidden; nay, they are our only Enemies, Enemies that fight againſt our Souls.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. When our Love, though it be partly right placed, yet it is either beyond the due meaſure and proportion, or doth not take in our whole Selves: Every one is bound by the Laws of God and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to love his own Fleſh; but he that ſo loveth his own Fleſh, that he neglects his Soul, he loves not his whole ſelf, and conſequently, hath indeed
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:50435:244"/>
leſs love for himſelf than he ſhould have. Thus he that loſeth his Life, ſhall ſave it: That Man that for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of a temporal Life, much leſs for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of ſome temporal Profit or Pleaſure, ſhall hazard his everlaſting Soul, loves himſelf leſs than he ſhould; becauſe he prefers the temporary advantage of his worſe part before the eternal advantage of his better part.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. When Love to a Man's ſelf wants the due ſubordination to our Love to God. The Good that is in God is infinite, and the Good that we receive from him, is the higheſt Good we are capable of: for our Being, which is our Capacity to receive any Good, and all the Comforts, Benefits and Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences that fill up that Capacity, we receive from him; and therefore our Love to him, ought to take up the whole Compaſs and Capacity of our Soul. <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy Soul, and with all thy might,</hi> the firſt and great Commandment, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.37. And as the Being of the Creature is a dependant Being, ſo his own Love to himſelf, ought to be a ſubordinate Love to him, upon whom it hath his dependance, <hi>Luke</hi> 26.14. <hi>If any man come to me, and hate not his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>yea, and his own life, he cannot be my diſciple.</hi> Yet ſuch is the wonderful Bounty and Wiſdom of the Will of God, that in Conformity thereunto, a man exactly conforms to his own Happineſs. Our higheſt and moſt univerſal Love to God, is joyned with a true and exact Love to our ſelves; for he hath conjoyned the Happineſs of the Creature with the Duty to himſelf: Both which we find, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.25. <hi>Whoſoever will loſe his life for my ſake, ſhall find it.</hi> It may ſo happen, that thy Love to thy Saviour may not conſiſt with thy external Honour, Wealth, or Peace, nay not
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:50435:244"/>
with the enjoyment of thy own Life; but it ſhall ever conſiſt with the life and bleſſedneſs of thy Soul unto all Eternity; and what can be an exchange equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to thy immortal Soul? Thus whilſt thou hateſt thy Life, when the Love and Duty, thou oweſt to God, calls for it, thou doſt at once perform a double duty, of Love to God, and Love to thy ſelf.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. From hence it appears, that in the relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween my Neighbour and my ſelf, there is a priority of Love due to my ſelf, to that Love I owe to my Neighbour: for the Love to my ſelf is preſuppoſed, and made the Rule of that Love I owe to my Neighbour: therefore in an equality of Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to my ſelf and my Neighbour, I am to prefer my ſelf; as if this unhappy Neceſſity ſhould lie upon me, either to preſerve my own Life, or that my Neighbour muſt loſe his, and that without my fault; I may, I muſt prefer the ſaving of my own Life: But where there is an inequality of Concernment, there the difficulty is great to diſcover the meaſure of my Duty to my Neighbour: <hi>de quibus infrá.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. From hence it is evident, that I am bound to love my Neighbour. This is evident, and it is that great Command of the New Teſtament, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.20.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. From hence it is evident, and it is the ſco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap> and ſubſtance of the Command, that we muſt love our Neighbour as our ſelves: Now this word <hi>as,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports Equality: therefore it is conſiderable, how far this Equality of Love to our Neighbour as to our ſelves, is to be extended:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Our Love to our Neighbour, muſt be of equal Sincerity and Integrity, with that Love a Man bears to himſelf: A Man loves himſelf ſincerely, he doth not pretend, or bear a diſſembled Love to himſelf, but it is in good earneſt, and with his Heart: I muſt
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:50435:245"/>
love my Neighbour as truly, as I love my ſelf. This is an Equality of Nature or Eſſence.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Our Love to our Neighbour, muſt be of the ſame order or method as our Love to our ſelves: As we are to prefer our chiefeſt Good, before our tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Good; and the good of our Souls, before that of our Bodies: ſo we ought to hold the ſame order in the Love we ſhew to our Neighbour, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.17. <hi>Thou ſhalt not hate thy brother in thy heart, but ſhalt reprove him.</hi> There is ſometimes a merciful Cruelty to be ſhewn to our Brother, pulling him out of the Fire, and holds reſemblance to the Love of God to us, that reproves, that he may not ſtrike; and ſtrikes, that he may not deſtroy. And this is an Equality of Order.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. But an Equality of Degree is not required, as it ſeems, and as is before touched: But though in an Equality we may prefer our ſelves, yet when there is a diſproportion, there in many caſes our Neighbour's Good is to be preferred before our own:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The ſalvation of our Neighbour's Soul is to be preferred before the preſervation of our own tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Life: much more ought we to deny our ſelves in thoſe things, which are onely uſeful or pleaſing to our Senſe, if the ſalvation of anothers Soul is concerned in it. And this was that which was meant, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.24. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.13. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.21. <hi>If meat make my brother offend, I will eat no fleſh while the world ſtandeth, leſt I make my brother offend.</hi> And as our Saviour laid down his natural Life, to redeem our everlaſting Souls from an eternal Death; ſo hath he lef<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> the ſame for an Example and a Command to us, <hi>John</hi> 13.34. <hi>A new command I give unto you, that ye <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                                 <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                              </gap> one another, as I have loved you:</hi> He had before
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:50435:245"/>
commanded us, that we ſhould love our Neighbour as our ſelves: and becauſe we might take out that Leſſon by his Example: Chriſt, the Son of God, who had all perfection in himſelf, and conſequently did, and muſt love himſelf; yet preferred the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Souls, before the preſervation of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Life, to be in this an Example to us, that if the exigence of the ſalvation of my Brother's Soul could not conſiſt with the preſervation of my own Life, I am bound to lay down that Life of mine, rather than his Soul ſhould be loſt, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.16. <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by perceive we the love of God, becauſe he laid down his life for us, and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. We are by vertue of this Precept, to prefer the preſervation of our Neighbours temporal Life, which otherwiſe would inevitably happen, before our own Safety, the hazard whereof, may poſſibly, but not neceſſarily endanger our own. This, among other Examples, is evidenced in the Example of <hi>Eſther,</hi> Eſther 4.16. A Decree was paſſed for the Maſſacre of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which would neceſſarily have enſued, if there were not a ſpeedy prevention: the only means to prevent it, was <hi>Eſthers</hi> Addreſs to the King; and ſuch an immediate Addreſs, without an Invitation, was preſent Death by the Law, <hi>Eſther</hi> 4.11. yet <hi>Eſther</hi> reſolves in that Exigence, to adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture her Life, <hi>Eſther</hi> 4.16. <hi>I will go unto the King, which is not according to the Law, and if I periſh, I pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh.</hi> So that although the Concernment be equal, my Neighbour's Life and my own Life, in which caſe, were there not a diſproportion of the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, I were bound to preſerve my own Life, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to loſe it, with the preſervation of my Neighbours; yet when the loſs of my Neighbour
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:50435:246"/>
Life is neceſſary without incurring ſome danger of my own, I am to truſt the good Providence of God with my own Life, in a dangerous Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it, rather than to ſee my Brother inevitably periſh. And the like proportion holds in matters of a lower Concernment.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Therefore much more it follows, that if the being of my Neighbour cannot conſiſt without the parting with ſomewhat that conſiſts with my tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral well-being, I am to prefer my Neighbour's being, before my own well-being: Thus I am bound to loſe my Eſtate, rather than ſee my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour loſe his Life, if my Eſtate would preſerve it. But this is ſtill intendible only, in caſe of an injurious taking away his Life: for if by the due courſe of Juſtice, my Neighbour's Life be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, I am not bound to buy his Pardon with the expence of my whole Eſtate: and ſo in caſe my Neighbour ſhall wilfully caſt away his own Life, in ſuch Caſes, there is a Latitude of Chriſtian Diſcretion left unto me, and I am not then a debtor to his Life.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. If my Neighbour's Neceſſity come in compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition with my Convenience only, I am bound by this Law of Love to prefer my Neighbour's Neceſſity before my own Convenience. If there be a poor Man, whoſe Exigences are ſuch, that he hath wherewith to preſerve Life only, but not to ſatisfie Nature; and I have wherewith to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Exigences of my Nature, with ſome Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; I am bound out of that to ſupply his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity. And though my corrupted Reaſon may object, that my future Condition may ſtand in need of that, which I now part with to anothers Neceſſity, we are in this, to truſt the Almighty,
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:50435:246"/>
to whom I lend in this my Charity, and though of his own, yet he is content for his own to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come my Debtor: And that Man cannot want, when God is pleaſed to become his Debtor. <hi>He that giveth to the poor, lendeth to the Lord, and he will repay him,</hi> Proverbs 19.17. Yet in the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring of Supplies for my own Neceſſity, I am to account for all thoſe, for whom I am bound to provide; for he that provideth not for his own Family, is worſe than an Infidel, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.8. yet herein take heed, that thy Heart deceive thee not.</p>

This Precept is reſolved into its Negative, <hi>Whatſoever ye would not that men ſhould do to you, that do not to them.</hi> And for the uſe of both, we are to take them both with theſe <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations:</hi>

                  </head>
                  <p n="1">1. THAT there is One, and but one, moſt Glorious <hi>God,</hi> Eternal, Incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, perfectly Happy, Infinite in Wiſdom, Power, and Goodneſs, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling all places, but comprehended in no place, full of Juſtice, Mercy, Truth and Perfection.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That this God, though but One in Eſſence, is yet Three in number of his Subſiſtence, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That this God in the beginning of time, <hi>created the World,</hi> commonly called the Heaven and Earth, which he ſtill governs, by his Power, Wiſdom, and Providence. And this he did, 1. For the Manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Glory of his Wiſdom, Power, and Goodneſs: 2. For the Communication of his Beneficence, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Bounty to the things which he thus made, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their ſeveral Natures and Capacities.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That having finiſhed this inferior World, called the Earth, and furniſhed it with all things neceſſary and convenient for the uſe and convenience of the nobler Creature which he intended, he created the firſt Man <hi>Adam,</hi> and the firſt Woman <hi>Eve, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:50435:250"/>
Parents of all Mankind:</hi> from whom all the Men and Women in the World are derived by natural Propagation.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. To theſe firſt Parents of Mankind, Almighty God gave ſome <hi>Endowments</hi> or conſtituent Parts, that are common to all Mankind, as well as to them: namely, 1. Terreſtrial or Earthly Bodies; for the firſt Man was made out of the Earth, and the Bodies of all other Men, though they are derived to them by ordinary Generation, yet their Bodies are terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrial or elementary Bodies: 2 Spiritual and Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Souls, endued not only with the Power of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getation, as Herbs and Trees: nor only with the Power of Senſe and Perception and Appetite, as the bruit Beaſts: but alſo with the Power of Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Liberty of Will, whereby he obtains a kind a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all other viſible Creatures beſides. And this Soul thus endued with the Power of Underſtanding and Will, doth not die with the Body; but it is immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and never dies. And this is called a Reaſonable Soul; whereby we underſtand, and think, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, and remember, and chuſe one thing, and refuſe another; whereby we have a Capacity to know Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, his Works, his Will, and to obey and obſerve it; and to perform all the Actions that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to a Reaſonable Creature. 3. A Power of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of their Kind, by the mutual conjunction of Sexes, by vertue of that Divine Benediction, given to Man, as well as to ſenſible Creatures: <hi>Be fruitful, multiply, and repleniſh the Earth.</hi> By vertue of which Benediction, all the Families of Mankind that were, or are, or ſhall be upon the face of the Earth, are in the courſe of ordinary Generation derived from the firſt Parents of Mankind. 4. A Power and Right of Dominion over the inferiour Creatures, which he doth exerciſe, partly by the ordination and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:50435:250"/>
of their Creation, and partly by the advantage of his underſtanding Faculty: and though this Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion be in ſome ſort weakened and decayed by the Fall of our firſt Parents; yet it ſtill, in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, continues to the Children of Men.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. But ſome Priviledges our firſt Parents had in their ſtate of Innocence, which by their Fall hath been much impaired and loſt, and not derived to their Poſterity: 1. A ſtate of perfect Innocence, free from all Sin, and ſinful contagion. 2. A ſtate of Happineſs and Bleſſedneſs, as large as Humane Nature could be capable of. 3. A ſtate of great Integrity and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, as far forth as it was poſſible for Humane Nature to enjoy: as Light and great Knowledge in his Underſtanding, Integrity in his Will, right Order in his Soul, Righteouſneſs and Holineſs. 4. A ſtate of Immortality of Body and Soul in their perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, ſo long as he kept his Innocence.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The Ends, for which Almighty God created Man thus, were, firſt thoſe common Ends, which moved him to create the World, above mentioned, namely, his own Glory, and the Communication of his Goodneſs and Beneficence: but ſecondly, theſe ſeem to be the ſpecial Ends of Man's Creation: 1. That he might have a Creature in this lower World, that might more conveniently, actively and effectually give glory unto God: and to that end, he endued him with Nobler Faculties that might perform this Office; his Underſtanding, whereby he might know his Maker, and his Will, and his Works; His Will, whereby he might obey his Will; his Affections, whereby he might love, and fear, and admire him; His Faculty of Speech, whereby he might glorifie and praiſe him; this is another kind of Glory than the other inferiours do, or can, bring to their Maker. And to the end he might thus glorifie his Maker, he placed him in
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:50435:251"/>
the view and ſight of the goodly frame of Heaven and Earth, and gave him his Law, wherein he ſhould obey and ſerve his Creator. 2. That he might be partaker of as much Happineſs and Bleſſedneſs as the Humane Nature could be capable of, while it ſtood in conjunction with his Body: and that he ſhould, by a kind of Tranſlation into Heaven, enjoy more Pure, Perfect, and Everlaſting ſtate of Bleſſedneſs and Glory.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. When God had thus created Man, he gave him <hi>a Law</hi> of Righteouſneſs and Holineſs, and reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to him: and for a Probation or Trial of his Obedience, forbad him the eating of the Fruit of one Tree in Paradiſe, under pain of Death.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Our firſt Parents rebelled againſt that juſt and eaſie Law, by eating the forbidden Fruit. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they did not preſently die corporally, yet they by this <hi>Diſobedience</hi> fell into theſe Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: 1. They were preſently under the Sentence of Everlaſting Death, though delivered from it by the Meſſiah, that promiſed ſeed. 2. They loſt the eſtate of Immortality of their Bodies, though they loſt not the ſtate of Immortality of their Souls, which were eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially Immortal. 3. They loſt their Innocence, their Happy Eſtate in Paradiſe, the clear and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Light of their Underſtanding, the Rectitude of their Wills, the right Order of their Affections: and their Souls loſt much of its Perfection, though not its eſſential Spirituality and Immortality. 4. All that were after derived from them by ordinary Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, though they had immortal Souls, yet their Faculties were imbaſed and corrupted, and greatly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered, and without the extraordinary Grace of God preventing and aſſiſting them, prone to all kind of evil and ſin, and thereby obnoxious to the wrath of God, and to everlaſting Death. And this is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:50435:251"/>
of all the Poſterity of <hi>Adam</hi> by Nature, except Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. God Almighty in his eternal wiſdom and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge of the fall of Man, in his infinite Wiſdom and Goodneſs, <hi>purpoſed to ſend forth his Son,</hi> to take the Humane Nature, and to become a King, a Prieſt, and a Prophet, and alſo a Sacrifice, to expiate the Sins of Mankind, and to make them again partakers of the great and eſſential part of that Happineſs, which the firſt Man loſt by his Fall: and ſo to recover unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Creature that might actually glorifie and ſerve him.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. And to make this Purpoſe effectual to our firſt Parents, and to thoſe that ſucceeded them before the coming of Chriſt the purpoſed Redeemer, Almighty God was pleaſed to uſe two Expedients: 1. He gave out <hi>the Promiſe of the Meſſiah,</hi> or the Seed of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, the ſeed in whom all Nations ſhould be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: and the Belief of this, though darkly revealed, became an Inſtrument or Means to render the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Meſſiah effectual to them, to partake of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of his Redemption, when it was joyned with the Obedience to the revealed Will of God in Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity. 2. He gave out <hi>Precepts</hi> directing Men to their Duty: and to the ſincere Endeavour of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to thoſe Precepts, he annexed the Benefit of Remiſſion of Sins and Acceptance of their Perſons and Duties, through the Meſſiah, or Chriſt that was to come.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. In the fulneſs or appointment of time, namely, about four thouſand years after the Creation of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, <hi>the Son of God,</hi> by a miraculous Conception of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> without the conjunction of Man, <hi>aſſumed the Humane Nature,</hi> became Man, lived about three and thirty years, diſcovered the Mind and Will

of God, touching Mankind, confirmed his Doctrine with unqueſtionable Miracles and Evidences from Heaven, and lived a moſt Holy and Spotleſs Life, and then was without cauſe crucified by the <hi>Jews,</hi> was buried, the third day he roſe from the dead, lived again, according as he promiſed, and converſed with his Diſciples forty days, then aſcended into the glorious Heavens, where he is in a ſtate of Glory and Power.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. And after his Aſcenſion, he ſent upon his Apoſtles, as he promiſed, the Power of <hi>the Holy Spirit,</hi> whereby they did many Miracles in witneſs of the truth of the Doctrine and Hiſtory of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="14">14 The Reaſons and Ends, <hi>why the Son of God thus took our Nature, became Man, and died for us,</hi> were theſe: 1. That the Eternal Counſel and Purpoſe of God, for the Recovering and Redemption of Mankind out of their loſt Condition, and all thoſe Predictions and Prophecies touching the ſame, might be fulfilled, and thereby the great God to have the Glory of his Wiſdom, Mercy, Power, and Truth. 2. That there might be a common Remedy for the Recovery of Mankind to their duty and ſubjection to Almighty God, that they might actively glorifie their Creator, according to the End of their Creation. 3. That there might be a common Remedy afforded to Mankind, to obtain in ſubſtance that Happineſs which they loſt in their firſt Parents, and by their own renewed Tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and a Means provided for the pardon of their Sins, and ſaving of their immortal Souls, and yet without derogation of the Divine Juſtice, and the Honour of his Government.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. In order to theſe great Ends, the Son of God was thus ſent from Heaven, and Commiſſionated as it were by the Father, principally to do theſe <hi>Great Buſineſſes</hi> in this World; firſt to <hi>acquaint the World</hi> with
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:50435:252"/>
the whole Will of God concerning Mankind: 2. To lay down a full and ſufficient <hi>Sacrifice</hi> for the Sins of the World, by his own Death and Paſſion: 3. To give the World all poſſible <hi>Aſſurance</hi> both of the Truth of his Doctrine and the Sufficiency of his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction by his wonderful Miracles, by his Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Aſcenſion, and by the Diffuſion of the Gifts of the Spirit upon his Apoſtles and Believers after his Aſcenſion.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. Touching the firſt of theſe, namely, <hi>the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of the Divine Will, touching Mankind;</hi> this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the Doctrine of the Goſpel, the Meſſage ſent from Heaven by the Son of God, touching all things to be believed, and to be done by the Children of Men, in order to their Redemption and attaining of everlaſting Happineſs. And this was neceſſary, becauſe the World was full of Darkneſs and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. And many things that were now neceſſary for Men to know, were but darkly revealed unto the former Ages of the World. The Son of God therefore came to bring Life and Immortality to light, by the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. <hi>The Doctrines of the Goſpel,</hi> which Chriſt brought with him into the World, were principally theſe:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That all Men have Immortal Souls, which muſt live to all Eternity, notwithſtanding the death of their Bodies.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That there ſhould come a Diſſolution of this preſent World, and at that time there ſhall be a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of all that had been dead, and a change of all that ſhould be then living, into an Immortal Eſtate.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That there ſhould at that day be a Final Judgment, where all Men ſhould be doomed, ſome to everlaſting Life and Happineſs, ſome to everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Miſery.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="468" facs="tcp:50435:253"/>4. That in the ſtrict Rule of Divine Juſtice, the Wages of every Sin is everlaſting Death and Miſery, which is fully deſcribed in the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That all Mankind is obnoxious to everlaſting Death and Miſery, becauſe all Mankind have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and are born in Sin. So that without the help of Mercy from God, all Mankind are in a loſt and deſperate Condition.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That yet for all this, Almighty God is willing that his Creature ſhould be reconciled to him, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to pardon his Sins, to be at peace with him, and everlaſtingly to ſave him, and to reſtore unto him that everlaſting Happineſs that he had loſt by his own ſin, and the ſin of our firſt Parents.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. But yet that all this ſhould be done in ſuch a way as might be conſiſtent with the Honour of his Juſtice and of his Government, as well as of his Mercy and of his Bounty: and therefore that he will have a Sacrifice and a Price laid down for the Sins of the World, namely, the precious Life of his own Son Jeſus Chriſt, that publiſhed this Doctrine to the World: And this Sacrifice and Satisfaction the glorious God would accept in a way of Juſtice, and yet in a way of Mercy, that his Juſtice might be ſatisfied, his Mercy magnified, and his Creature ſaved.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. And that becauſe it would be neither agreeable to the Honour nor the Wiſdom of Almighty God, that any Man that had the uſe of his Reaſon and Underſtanding, ſhould have the fruit and benefit of this Mercy and Sacrifice, without returning to his Duty to God by true Repentance for what he had done amiſs, and by better Obedience to God: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was there any fitneſs or ſuitableneſs between a Pure and Holy God, or that Bleſſedneſs which
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:50435:253"/>
Mankind might expect with him, and a People that ſhould yet continue deſperately ſinful and impure: and it was alſo reaſonable and fit, that if Mankind would expect the Reſtitution to that everlaſting Happineſs, that they loſt by their own ſins, and the ſin of their firſt Parents, then they ſhould alſo return to their Duty and Obedience to God, and perform in ſome meaſure, that End, for which Mankind was at firſt created, namely actively, to glorifie that God that had made them eſpecially after ſo great an addition of Mercy, as the Redemption of the World by the Death of his own Son; therefore he appointed and intended, and publiſhed to the World, that all, that would have the fruit and benefit of this great Redemption, ſhould <hi>repent</hi> of their Sins, and <hi>endeavour ſincerely</hi> to obey the Precepts of Piety, Sobriety, and Righteouſneſs, commanded by Almighty God by the Meſſage of his Son.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. And becauſe, that if thoſe to whom this Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the Goſpel of Chriſt ſhould be publiſhed, ſhould yet not believe the ſame, nor believe that Jeſus was the true Meſſias, or that his Doctrine was the true and real Meſſage of Almighty God to the World, it could never be expected that they would obey this Heavenly Command, nor return to God, or the Duty they owed him: he did therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of all Perſons that were of Underſtanding, to whom the Goſpel ſhould be publiſhed, that they ſhould <hi>Believe</hi> it to be True, and believe that Chriſt was the True Meſſias, the great Sacrifice for the Sin of the World, and the Doctrine which he preached, was the Will of God concerning Man.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. And thus there are theſe <hi>Conditions</hi> to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed on the part of thoſe that will expect the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Redemption purchaſed by the Blood of
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:50435:254"/>
Chriſt: 1. That all, that are of Underſtanding, to whom the Goſpel is preached, ſhould <hi>Believe</hi> it to be the Truth, and reſt upon it as the Truth of God: 2. That they ſhould be heartily ſorry for their former Sins, and <hi>Repent</hi> of them, and turn from them. This is <hi>Repentance.</hi> 3. That they ſhould in all Sincerity, endeavour to conform their Hearts and Wills, and Lives, to the Precepts and Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Chriſt and his Goſpel, which is called <hi>Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi> and new Obedience.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. And becauſe, when we have done all we can, yet we are in this Life compaſſed about with many Infirmities and Temptations, and ſubject to fail in our Duty to God, and to theſe Holy Precepts of the Goſpel; yet the merciful God hath aſſured us by his Son Chriſt Jeſus, that if we <hi>ſincerely endeavour</hi> to obey the Precepts of the Goſpel, and <hi>repent</hi> for our Failings herein, and ſo renew our Peace with God by unfeigned <hi>Repentance,</hi> the ſame Sacrifice of his Son ſhall be accepted to expiate for our Sins and Failings, and the bleſſed God will accept of our ſincere, though imperfect Obedience, as a Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of that part of the Covenant of the Goſpel, that concerns our Obedience to God, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the Goſpel. And this is called <hi>Evangelical Obedience,</hi> which, though it be not perfect, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſincere and accompanied with real and ſincere Endeavours to obey, and Repentance for our daily Failings, is accepted of God through the Sacrifice of Chriſt, who is not only our Sacrifice and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation, but alſo our Interceſſor and Mediator at the right hand of God. <hi>If any man ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father, even Jeſus Chriſt, who ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth at the right hand of the Father,</hi> 1 John 2.1. Heb. 8.1. &amp; 10.12.</p>
                  <p n="12">
                     <pb n="471" facs="tcp:50435:254"/>12. And becauſe many times, <hi>Example</hi> gives a great Light and Life to Precepts, our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in his Life, gave us an excellent Example of the Practice of thoſe Precepts, which he hath given to us; as namely, Obedience and Submiſſion to the Will of God; Invocation upon him, Holineſs, Purity, Sobriety, Patience, Righteouſneſs, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, Charity, Compaſſion, Bounty, Truth, Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, Uprightneſs, Heavenly mindedneſs, low eſteem of Worldly Glory, Condeſcenſion, and all thoſe Graces and Vertues that he requires and expects from us.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. And as thus our Lord Jeſus came to inſtruct us in all things neceſſary for us to believe and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, and to give us an admirable Pattern and Example of a Holy and Vertuous Life: ſo, 2. He came <hi>to die for us,</hi> and to die ſuch a Death, as had in it all the Circumſtances of Bitterneſs, and yet accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with unſpotted Innocence and incomparable Patience, and he thus died <hi>for theſe Ends.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. To lay down a Ranſom for the Sins of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and a Price for the Purchace of Everlaſting Life and Happineſs for all thoſe that receive him, believe in him, and obey the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To ſatisfie the Juſtice of God, to make good his Truth, to vindicate the Honour of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and to proclaim his Juſtice, his Indignation againſt Sin, and yet to magnifie his Love and Mercy to Mankind, in giving his Son to be a Price of their Redemption.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To give a juſt indication unto all the World of the vileneſs of Sin, the abhorrence of it, that coſt the Son of God his Life, when he was but under the imputed guilt of it, that ſo Mankind might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt and avoid Sin, as the vileſt of Evils.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="472" facs="tcp:50435:255"/>4. To give a moſt unparallel'd Inſtance of his Love to the World, that did chuſe to die for the Children of Men, to redeem them from Everlaſting Death.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And thereby to oblige Mankind with the moſt obliging and indearing Inſtance to love and obey that Jeſus, that thus died for them, and out of the common Principles of Humanity and Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, to love and obey him, that thus loved them, and laid down his Life for them.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. To give a moſt convincing Evidence of the Truth of his Doctrine, and the Sincereneſs of his Profeſſions of Love to Mankind, by ſealing the ſame with his own Blood.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. OF <hi>God,</hi> and therein 1. Of <hi>his Purity and Holineſs;</hi> one that cannot endure to behold iniquity. <hi>The Stars are not pure in his ſight,</hi> Job 25.5. Job 15.15. <hi>and his Angels he chargeth with folly,</hi> Job 4.18. How then canſt thou think to draw near to the Holy God, when thy Heart and thy Lips, and thy Life are clothed with Impurity and Filthineſs? when thy Thoughts, the only Inſtruments whereby thou canſt converſe with him, are buſied in Conſiderations unworthy of a Spirit, much more unworthy of the God of Spirits? Canſt thou think that this Holy God will accept of the productions of that Soul, thy Prayers and Meditations, who but now was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in baſe unclean earthy Thoughts, and didſt but now part with them, with a reſolution to reſume them? Every impure thought leaves a mark and blot upon thy Soul, that remains when thy Thought is paſt; and canſt thou bring that ſpotted Soul into the preſence of the Pure and Holy God, without confuſion and ſhame? Thou art now going about with thy Lips to
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:50435:257"/>
draw near unto God; Remember how many vain and unprofitable words, how many murmuring and unthankful words, how many unclean and filthy words, how many falſe and diſſembling words, how many proud and arrogant words, how many ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious and vindictive words, how many hypocritical and deceitful words, how many ſeducing and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leading words, how many ungodly and blaſphemous words, have ſtain'd and polluted thoſe calves of thy Lips, thou art now about to ſacrifice to thy Creator. Thou art about to undertake a Converſation and walking with God; <hi>Can two walk together unleſs they are agreed?</hi> Amos 3.3. How then canſt thou, a pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted Man in all thy actions, even thoſe of the beſt denomination, expect to have a Converſation with the Holy, Holy, Holy Lord? The ſtains of thy Life paſt ſtick upon thee, and thou art not cleanſed from them; and the Sea of Corruption that is within thee, will, notwithſtanding thy higheſt Reſolutions, never ceaſe to caſt out mire and dirt.</p>
                  <p>O Lord, it is true, I am a ſinful Man, and the whole frame of my Heart, and Lips, and Life, hath been only evil and that continually: and as I have been, ſo ſtill I muſt continue, without thy Mercy to pardon and cleanſe me. My pollutions and impurities are ſuch as may juſtly affright me from coming near thy Holineſs, leſt I ſhould be conſumed; ſuch as may diſcourage my Prayers and Applications unto thee, leſt I ſhould ſtain and infect them: and it is no more in my power to change or cleanſe my ſelf from the ſtains of my ſins paſt, or from the grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evils of my Nature, than in the Leopard to change his ſpots; ſo that I may moſt juſtly conclude, that it were extream preſumption for me to draw near unto thee, and rather cry out with the Diſciple,
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:50435:257"/>
                     <hi>Depart from me, O Lord, for I am a ſinful man,</hi> Luk. 5.8. But if I ſit where I am, I ſhall periſh; and if I draw near unto thee, I can but die. That Purity that I behold in thee, is the Purity of the great God; and my ſins are the ſins of a finite Creature: my ſinfulneſs cannot defile thy Holineſs; but thy Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs may cleanſe my impurity: That Fire which will conſume an impure and a proud Heart, will cleanſe an impure and unhumble Heart. O Lord I deſire to abhor my ſelf in duſt and aſhes: Unleſs thou hadſt ſhewn me my filthineſs, I could not have ſeen it; and unleſs thy Grace had been with my Heart, I could not have humbled my ſelf before thee: Unleſs thou hadſt called me, I could not have moved toward thee. Thy Promiſes, upon which my Soul ſhall ever fix till thou throw me off, are full of bounty and tenderneſs even to the vileſt of Sinners: No ſin of ſo deep a dye, but thy Mercy can waſh away: No Corruption ſo hideous, but thy Grace can cleanſe. And ſo far haſt thou condeſcended to the weakneſs of thy Creature, that thou haſt given us a viſible Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, whoſe Blood is ſufficient to cleanſe us from all our Guilt, a viſible Fountain to waſh for Sin and for Uncleanneſs, even the Blood of the Son of God, which cleanſeth us from all Sin, which cleanſeth our Conſciences from the guilt and ſtain of Sin, and waſheth our Bodies from the dominion and pollution of Sin; and by that Blood hath opened a new and living way for us into the preſence of God, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10.20. and given acceſs thereby into the Holieſt, and given us a Commiſſion to draw near with acceptation into his preſence, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10.19.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>Preſence of God. Whither ſhall I fly from thy preſence?</hi> Pſal. 139.7. He ſeeth the ſecreteſt corners of the World, and the ſecreteſt chambers of thy
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:50435:258"/>
Heart, and all the Gueſts that are there, even thy cloſeſt Thoughts and Contrivances and Purpoſes; much more thy moſt retired and deepeſt Actions are as legible to him as if they were graved in Braſs. And the deep and ſetled and frequent Conſideration of this, will be of excellent uſe upon all occaſions.</p>
                  <p>Is thy Heart <hi>ſollicited</hi> by thy ſelf (as our unhappy Hearts are our own tempters) or by any Object, or by the perſwaſions of others, or by the ſuggeſtion of the Devil, to impure Speculations, or ſinful Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, to atheiſtical Diſputations, to proud or arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Conceptions of thy ſelf, to revengeful or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable or forbidden Wiſhes, to vain and unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable thoughts? Remember thou and all thoſe thy Thoughts (which even natural Modeſty or Prudence would ſhame thee to publiſh before a mortal Man as thou art) are all naked and manifeſt before the Great, Holy, and Immortal God, whoſe Eyes walk through all the corners of thy Heart: And dareſt thou in his preſence to entertain ſuch Gueſts as theſe in that place where thy Creator is preſent, in that place which thou pretendeſt to make a Temple for him, in that place which the Lord of Heaven is pleaſed moſt juſtly and moſt mercifully to claim as his own? Conſider what a Preſence thou art in: he is not only an Eye-witneſs of the impurities of thy Heart (which yet if there were nothing elſe, might juſtly ſhame thee) but it is his Preſence who hath forbidden thee to entertain ſuch Vermin as theſe in thy Heart, under pain of eternal Death; it is thy Judge that ſees thee; it is the great Creator, before whom the Angels of Heaven cover their Faces, not being able to behold his Glory: And, which is more than all this, to an ingenuous Nature, it is he to whom thou oweſt thy ſelf and all thou art; he to whom thou haſt
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:50435:258"/>
given up thy name, that hath purchaſed thy heart from Hell with the price of his Son's blood: And how canſt thou chuſe but tremble and be confounded, to think that thou ſhouldeſt, contrary to all the bonds of duty and gratitude, even in his preſence and before his face, let in again thoſe abominations into thy heart, from which it was cleanſed by the Blood of Chriſt?</p>
                  <p>Again, Hath a ſinful thought, through incogitancy of the preſence of God, <hi>entred</hi> into thy heart? Yet remember the preſence of God, before it grow into a purpoſe or reſolution: or if it hath gone ſo far as a <hi>Reſolution,</hi> yet remember that preſence, and thou canſt not dare to perfect this hideous conception unto acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and improve <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s queſtion, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39.9. <hi>How can I do this great wickedneſs, and ſin againſt God?</hi> Thy Creator, thy Judge beholds thee. Let it be the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of thy humiliation to conſider that thou haſt ſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the habitation of his preſence by admitting a ſinful thought; that thou haſt in his preſence and in his place nouriſhed it into a reſolution: And therefore let it be at laſt thy care at leaſt to kill this reſolution before it comes to action by improving this practical conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the preſence of the Holy, Glorious and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible God: And if, notwithſtanding this conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, thy Soul ſhrink not from thy purpoſe; or if thou reject the conſideration of his preſence, that thou mayeſt the more quietly and contentedly ſin; or if thou precipitate thy reſolution into action, leſt the conſideration of his preſence ſhould ſtep into thy heart and divert thee; Thy ſin is heightned, and thou addeſt contempt of God unto thy offence, by reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Light and Grace, that might and would, if brought to thy heart, reſtrain thee, and with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous ſinner in <hi>Job</hi> 21.14. thou ſayeſt to God,
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:50435:259"/>
                     <hi>Depart from me, for I deſire not the knowledge of thy ways.</hi> And it is no wonder if he take thee at thy word, and depart from thee to all Eternity, by the preſence of his Love and Goodneſs, though his ſevere and angry Eye and preſence ever reſt upon thee.</p>
                  <p>Again, Is the God of Heaven an Eye-witneſs of <hi>thy carriage</hi> when either by thy ſelf or others thou art ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited to evil? Take <hi>courage to reſiſt</hi> this temptation, becauſe thy Creator ſees thee. Ask thy temptation, whether it can ſecure thee from the ſight and wrath of God, whether it can countervail thy damage in diſpleaſing him that beholds thee? Doſt thou want Courage or Reſolution to oppoſe it? Conſider thy Lord ſtands by to ſee and obſerve and reward thee in thy oppoſition. Couldeſt thou ſee but that Glory that hath commanded thy reſiſtance of evil, and how near it ſtands by thee, all the choiceſt ſolicitations to any ſin would die in their firſt offer againſt thee. Doſt thou doubt thy ſtrength to oppoſe it? Know that thou canſt not want ſtrength, if thou haſt but reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: It is thy cowardiſe makes thee weak; it is not thy weakneſs that makes thee cowardly: All the men in the World, nor all the Devils in Hell, could not faſten a ſin upon thee, unleſs thou firſt conſent. But ſuppoſe thou doubteſt thy own heart, yet conſider thy Maker's preſence, who is by thee, and able to ſupport thee, if thou wilt but lay hold of his ſtrength; and that ſtrength of his he offers thee if thou wilt but take it: And it is not poſſible thou ſhouldeſt wanr it, if thou ſeriouſly conſider that he is preſent; for it is an act of thy Faith whereby thou doſt believe his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and by the ſame act thou doſt partake of all that Goodneſs and Truth and Mercy, which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies his preſence, and will bear thee up againſt the moſt accompliſht temptation. Conſider that the
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:50435:259"/>
Preſence of God, that beholds thy carriage in a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, as it muſt needs add an infinite diſhonour and ſhame and confuſion, that in the preſence of the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and Pure God thou ſhouldeſt ſink under a baſe temptation contrary to the Commands and Holineſs of him that beholds thee, ſo it cannot chuſe but ſtrengthen thee againſt the ſtrongeſt temptation by the anticipation of that comfort and contentment that thou muſt needs have by holding thine integrity when ſuch thoughts as theſe ſhall move thy heart: I am now ſolicited to break my Maker's Command for a periſhing profit or pleaſure: whatſoever my ſucceſs be, I know the Glorious, Holy, Mighty God ſees my demeanour, even he that hath his reward in his hand of Indignation, and Vengeance, and ſhame, in caſe I yield to this unworthy ſolicitation; And Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, Glory and Immortality, in caſe I ſtick to his Command: and ſhall I in the preſence of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty and Glorious God prefer the ſatisfaction of an unworthy luſt or temptation, with ſhame in the preſence of my Creator, before my Obedience unto him, even in his own ſight, when he looks upon me, and encourageth me with a promiſe of ſtrength to aſſiſt me, and of Glory to reward me?

Pains, my Dangers, my Loſſes, my Diſcomforts are great; But they are not hid from God, he is preſent and his <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and if he ſaw it not fit for me to be afflicted, it is enough I have learned to acknowledge his Wiſdom, and with patience and chearfulneſs to ſubmit to him, who meaſures out every dram of this bitter potion to moſt wiſe Ends, and yet ſtands by to manage it: He is preſent and his <hi>Power and Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence,</hi> and my Prayers have no long journey to come unto him; when my Exigences are at the higheſt his Power is enough, and near enough to help me in the very article of neceſſity; and when I am ſinking with <hi>Peter,</hi> he hath an arm near enough to reſcue me from the ripe and victorious danger: He is preſent and his <hi>Compaſſion and Mercy and Tenderneſs and Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> who will not ſuffer me to be tempted above what I am able to bear: It is his Mercy that hath thus much or thus long afflicted me; for ſo much the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of my Soul, it may be, did require. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.75. <hi>Thy Judgments are right, and thou in faithfulneſs haſt afflicted me:</hi> And that I am afflicted no more, it is thy Mercy. For he ſtands by, and ſees what meaſure conſiſts with my Good, and when the meaſure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to exceed my ſtrength, and either eaſeth my bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, or helps me to bear it: <hi>In all their afflictions he was afflicted,</hi> Iſa. 63.9. He is preſent and <hi>his All-ſufficiency:</hi> and this is enough to ſwallow up all the bitterneſs and darkneſs of my extreameſt miſery. The comfort and beauty and goodneſs of every thing in it ſelf, or which it can reach out to me by fruition or participati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is that which is derived to it only from the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Power, and Goodneſs of God; and there is no more of good in the Creature than what he lends it; neither can it communicate to me more, nor can I receive more from it than what he enables it to give,
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:50435:260"/>
and me to receive: And the Creatures are but thoſe Veſſels accommodated and fitted to my Nature, out of which I drink that good, that he hath put into them: and if he put not communicative good into the Creatures, they will prove but empty Veſſels unto me, or ſuch as are ſealed up and cannot communicate that Good that is in them: Without his particular Bounty unto me, the Creature unto me will be but like the Prophet's Book, which he that is learned could not read, becauſe it was ſealed; and he to whom it was opened could not read it, becauſe he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned: Either the Good that is in them is ſealed up to me, and it cannot be drawn out; or I am ſealed up to it, and cannot draw it out. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 6.2. <hi>A man to whom God hath given riches, wealth and honour, ſo that he wanteth nothing, yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof:</hi> So then the concluſion of all is, That all the Good that is in the things we enjoy, and in the enjoyment where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of men account themſelves happy, and in the want whereof they account themſelves miſerable, is but a derived Good from the chiefeſt Good, but a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Good which is in the chiefeſt Good; But a Good at the ſecond hand, which at the firſt hand is to be found in all perfection in the chiefeſt Good: And therefore if I can but enjoy the Preſence and Communion of the chiefeſt Good, I ſhall with and in him enjoy all that Good, and far more, in the Fountain, though all the Conduits through which they are ordinarily derived to man by the Creatures, are ſtopped to me. It is an act of great Mercy and Wiſdom in God that, when the moſt part of men are led meerly by ſenſe, and underſtand not the preſence of God, and that All-ſufficiency that is in him, he is pleaſed to derive a ſuitable Good unto their Natures, by ſuch ſenſible inſtruments unto which men may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort,

and therein may find thoſe Goods that are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate to their nature and condition; as, to Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines and Phyſick for their health and cures; to Bread and Meat for the ſupply of their hunger; to Muſick and Wine for refreſhing their Spirits; to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications, Confederacies and civil Conjunctions for preventing or repreſſing of injuries, and the like; for through theſe Chanels God is pleaſed to derive, at the ſecond hand, and as it were at a diſtance, that Good which men find in them: But how great is that Mercy, that diſcovers God himſelf to be near unto me, and to compaſs me about; and diſcovers in him a Sea of All ſufficiency infinitely more than proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to all my Exigences; and gives me an acceſs immediately to that All-ſufficiency, where I ſhall find at the firſt hand all that Good, that is ſtrained and runs through the Creatures at a diſtance, where I may and ſhall, if I be not defective to my ſelf, moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly have whatſoever the Creature can afford, or what ſhall abundantly ſupply that defect to my grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter advantage and contentment!

Are my loſſes great, and of thoſe things wherein I took moſt delight? yet they cannot countervail the enjoyment of the Preſence of the All-ſufficient God. Is my body full of tortures or diſeaſes, and death looks in upon me between the Curtains, and my Soul ſitting upon my lips, and like the light of a dying Candle, taking her flight from my body? yet the Preſence of the All-ſufficient God is able to make this valley of the ſhadow of death lightſom, and thoſe pains eaſie, and bear up my Soul againſt the horrour and amazement

of death: for he ſtands by me with ſtrength to ſupport me, with Victory and Immortality to receive that Soul (the only ſeat where my fear can dwell) into a more near and immediate ſenſe of his Preſence, than in my body it could feel: Only remember, that though the Preſence of his Eſſence cannot be excluded from any place or perſon, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.34. yet there are occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that may ſeparate from the ſenſe of his preſence, or make his preſence terrible unto thee. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.2. <hi>Your iniquities have ſeparated between you and your God; and your ſins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear.</hi> And if ſuch an unhappy time befal thee, that he hide from thy Soul his comfortable preſence, let it be thy care to return unto him by humbling of thy heart ſincerely before him for thy relapſe. He never departs from any till man firſt depart from him; and he never hides himſelf long from any that in ſincerity return unto him. The very moving of thy heart to ſeek him is the work of his Power and Mercy upon thee, and is an undeniable evidence that he hath not utterly forſaken thee: unleſs he firſt did ſeek and find thee, and touch that heart of thine with his own fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, thy heart would rather die in her ſin than return unto God; and therefore be ſure thy returning to him ſhall not be without a finding of him: Only make this uſe of thy Experience of ſuch a caſe: bleſs the Mercy of God, that hath not rejected thee, though thou haſt forſaken him: bleſs the Mediation of thy Redeemer, that when thou little thinkeſt of it, intercedes for thy pardon, and ſends out his Spirit to reduce his way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, ſinful, wandring Creature: bleſs the Bounty and Patience of God, that is ſo ready to accept again into favour his relapſed but humbled Creature; and remember that it is an evil thing and a bitter to depart from him: fall upon thy knees with tears of ſorrow

for thy ingratitude, and tears of joy for thy re enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment into the preſence of him, that yet is pleaſed to own thee as a Father: take up indignation againſt thy ſin that hath deprived thee of ſo great a Good as the comfortable Preſence of God; and take up jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous thoughts over thy ſelf and all thy ways, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider well of all thy enterpriſes before thou undertake them, whether there be any thing in them that may offend thy reconciled Father: and becauſe thy Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is weak, and cannot ſo clearly diſcern thy way, and thy ſtrength is weak in oppoſing of temptation, ſuſpect thy own judgment and ſtrength, and beg his Wiſdom to teach thee, and his Strength to aſſiſt thee, and lean not to thy own Underſtanding.</p>
                  <p>Again, The conſideration of the Preſence of God is of ſingular uſe in all thy <hi>Duties of Piety and Charity.</hi> In the doing of them it will cleanſe thy heart from Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, becauſe thou art before the God that ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the heart, and accordingly accepteth of the action. It will keep thee from unſeemlineſs and want of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, becauſe the Lord of Heaven and Earth is preſent and an Eye-witneſs to all the deportment of thy Body and Soul. It will keep thee from ſluggiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, formality and deadneſs of heart, becauſe he ſtands by thee that ſees not as man ſees. It will keep thee from Pride and vain Glory; it will make thy heart ſincere, reverent, watchful, earneſt and humble in all thou doſt, becauſe as he that ſtands by thee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires all this in all thy Duties, ſo theſe affections or habits of the Soul become the Creature that knows he is in the Preſence of the Glorious and Infinite God, that ſearcheth the hearts, and ſees the actions. And as in thy Duties it will fit thee for them, ſo after thy Duties it will comfort thee in them. Hath thy heart been truly humbled in his preſence for any ſin, for
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:50435:263"/>
which thou haſt begged pardon, and mingled the Blood and Interceſſion of thy Saviour with thy Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers? Haſt thou been upon thy knees before him for any thing neceſſary for thy Soul, Body, or Relations? Haſt thou endeavoured by a ſerious Meditation to conſider of Divine Truths? Haſt thou examined the ſtate of thy Soul and of thy Life, and upon the view thereof taken up reſolutions of amendment of what is amiſs, and perſevering and increaſing in what is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to his Will? Haſt thou ſought out to relieve thoſe that are in want, to recompenſe thoſe that thou haſt injured, to advance the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt? Haſt thou been doing any thing that is the duty of thy general Calling as thou art a Chriſtian, or that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Calling or Employment into which God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence hath caſt thee? And can thy heart bear thee witneſs that in all this thou haſt endeavoured with all ſincerity, as in the Preſence of God, to walk and act in obedience to him, and with a clear and upright heart and conſcience? Be ſure thy heart cannot more clearly evidence it ſelf to thy ſelf than it doth to God; and God was all this while preſent with thee, behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thee; there is not one grain of the ſincerity and integrity of any of theſe thy actions, not one tear, not one thought of thy heart loſt, but moſt exactly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and weighed by him that weigheth the Spirits, and they ſhall not return unto thee empty: <hi>Acts</hi> 10.4. <hi>Thy Prayers and thy Alms are come up for a memorial before God.</hi>

And this conſideration, as it may ſtrengthen our hearts in the Promiſes of God, ſo it will make the Hiſtories of <hi>the Book of God</hi> of ſingular uſe to us upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, when we ſhall with <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 77.10. <hi>I will remember the years of the right hand of the moſt High: I will remember the works of the Lord: I will remember thy won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of old:</hi> and together with it conſider that the ſame
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:50435:264"/>
Lord that did thus or thus in former times, is the ſame God yeſterday, to day, and for ever. And by this conſideration every Hiſtory in the Book of God is as a meaſure for all the preſent or future con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments of my ſelf and others, and will teach me how to behave my ſelf in the like occaſions, and to judge even of future Events. In the paſſages of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture we ſee a wonderful order and conſtancy for the moſt part; for all things conform themſelves to thoſe Rules which God hath put into them; and that is the beſt and higheſt reſolution we can give for them; for when we come to make a particular inquiry into the particular cauſes of thoſe things, there is not the eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of his Work, and that which long and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant continuance hath made obvious to all men, but the wiſeſt of men, notwithſtanding all theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, are puzled and confounded in; becauſe the God of Nature hath not revealed it to men, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.19. <hi>His way is in the Sea, and his path in the great wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and his footſteps are not known.</hi> There we ſee a certainty, but we cannot find the immediate Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Cauſe of it: But in the paſſages of Mankind we are to ſeek for any certainty at all, or the Cauſes of that uncertainty, whch made the Wiſe man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that God had ſet the one againſt the other, that men ſhould find nothing after him, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.14. which is moſt certainly true as to a bare natural or rational obſervation: Yet even theſe Works of God are ſought out of all them that have pleaſure in them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 111.2. and though his Judgments are a great deep, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.6. unſearchable and paſt finding out, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.33. till he is pleaſed to diſcover them; yet he is ſtill Unchangeable, and the ſame yeſterday, and to day, and for ever. So much even of thoſe ſecret ways towards men, as is expedient for our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:50435:265"/>
and uſe, he hath diſcovered in his Book to thoſe that will diligently obſerve it: Thus <hi>the ſecret of the Lord is with them that fear him,</hi> Pſal. 25.14. The moſt of the varieties that happen to the Children of men do ariſe from the Immutability of God in his Purity and in his Juſtice. If a ſtreight Line be drawn parallel to another, though they be infinitely extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they will keep the ſame diſtance one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but if the Line be crooked, it will be in ſome places nearer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſome places farther off, and it may be will croſs the ſtreight Line. God hath given to man a Liberty of his Will, and ſo long as his Will and the Actions of his Will ran parallel in a ſtreight Line to the Will of God, there was ſtill a communication of Good from God to his Creature: But when man choſe crooked ways, he is drawn thereby ſometimes away from God, and ſo is removed from his Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings and Communion; ſometimes it croſſeth and thwarts him, and then it meets with his Wrath and Vengeance. And this muſt needs be ſo, unleſs we ſhould with the preſumptuous Fool in the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.21. think that God is ſuch a one as our ſelves, and his Will as crooked as ours. If a bare reaſonable man had looked upon the ſtate of the Jews from the time of their going out of <hi>Egypt</hi> until their final Captivity, he would eaſily ſee as much variety as in any ſtate of men, and perhaps ſee as little cauſe for it: But yet that very changeableneſs of their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth moſt admirably ſet forth the Immutability of God, and inſtruct us how to judge of things and men. They were a People in Covenant with him, and he was pleaſed to enter into Covenant with them, and ſo long as they kept to their undertaking, not one tittle of all his Promiſe failed them. But when they once forſook him he warns, and if they repent not he
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:50435:265"/>
forſakes them; if they walk contrary to him he walks contrary to them; and if after all this they return and repent, he returns to them; ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106, 107. the abbreviation of their Viciſſitudes. And when at laſt they were wholly corrupted, then the wrath of God aroſe, and there was no remedy. All theſe varieties juſtifie the Equality and Evenneſs of the ways of God, and manifeſt the crookedneſs and inequality of the ways of Men.</p>
                  <p>And is God the ſame now that he was then? his ways then are the ſame now that they were then. Art thou one that haſt entred into Covenant with God? beware thou keep to it, and walk humbly with thy God: if not, be ſure thou ſhalt meet with the like meaſure as his People of old did, his Juſtice is the ſame ſtill, he will ſcourge thee with the rod of men, though if thou haſt a heart to return, he will not ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly take his loving-kindneſs from thee. And haſt thou met with the fruit of this ſin in a temporal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment? conſider it is an evil thing and a bitter to depart from the Living God. What madeſt thou wander from thy ſtrength and thy ſafety as well as thy Covenant and thy Duty? What couldeſt thou expect to find when thou ſtragleſt from him, but that ſome evil ſhould overtake thee? Get home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain as faſt as thou canſt; and as thou haſt found that he is the ſame God of Juſtice that ever he was; ſo thou ſhalt find that he is the ſame God of Mercy and Tenderneſs, upon returning, that ever he was, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.45. <hi>And he remembred for them his Covenant, and repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to the multitude of his Mercies.</hi>

                  <p>It is true, the ſame thing may befal ſeveral men, or one man at ſeveral times, and yet they may be of different natures, one may be a Chaſtiſement, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may be a Trial, and another may be a Favour:

it is according as the thing ſent hath its Commiſſion from him that ſends it. If it be a Chaſtiſement, it is not without a ſting. If it be a Tryal, it is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an iſſue. If it be a Favour, it is not without a great meaſure of comforts mingled with it.</p>

A <hi>Chaſtiſement</hi> for a ſin paſt carries with it the poiſon and malignity of the ſin which cauſes it; as the fruit carries the nature of that ſeed from whence it grows: <hi>Jer.</hi> 21.14. <hi>Thy way and thy doings have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured theſe things unto thee: this is thy wickedneſs becauſe it is bitter. Jer.</hi> 4.18. the Affliction taſted of the ſin. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.12. <hi>Mine iniquities have taken hold upon me.</hi> Pſal. 38.3. <hi>There is no reſt in my bones becauſe of my ſin.</hi> And this, like the Trumpet in the Mount, waxeth louder and louder, and Prayers for Deliverance prove fruitleſs, though they come from a <hi>Joſhua,</hi> Joſh. 7.10. till the accurſed thing be ſought out; for till then the meſſage that the Affliction brings is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and it will not give over vexing the man till it hath done his Errand. When a man begins to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine his ways, and finds out the root of his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and humbles himſelf before God for his ſin, then, and not till then, can he expect a Deliverance. When <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 38. had run over the Catalogue of his Sufferings, his Prayer for Deliverance was never ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, <hi>v.</hi> 22. till he had undertaken Confeſſion and Repentance of his Sin, <hi>v.</hi> 18. If upon the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Admonitions of the Almighty in the Conſcience, a man liſtens not, he hath a Meſſenger ſent to him that will be heard, <hi>Job</hi> 33.16. <hi>Then he openeth the ear of man;</hi> and it may be by a diſeaſe in his Body, or ſome other affliction, and he ſtands by to ſee how this meſſage is entertained, <hi>v.</hi> 27, 28. <hi>And if any ſay, I have ſinned and perverted what was right, and it profited me not, then he will deliver his Soul,</hi> &amp;c. A Chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:50435:266"/>
for a ſin hath at the ſame time an Act of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, as it looks backward to the ſin, and an Act of Mercy, as it looks forward to an Amendment; and the latter is the principal End of God in it: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with the Repentance either the Chaſtiſement is........ if immanent, or if tranſient and paſt, is ſweetned with a ſenſe of God's Reconciliation.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) If it be a <hi>Tryal,</hi> that carries with it his meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage; for if upon an impartial inquiry, a man cannot find any eminent ſin unrepented of, yet it pleaſeth God to lay his hand upon him; yet it brings theſe Leſſons with it: 1. To acknowledge the Juſtice of God for all this. It is ſomewhat ſtrange that <hi>Job</hi> could ſo much juſtifie himſelf againſt his Sufferings, and yet was made to poſſeſs the ſins of his youth. Thoſe little ſins, which were paſſed twenty or thirty years ſince, and had all the extenuations of the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of Nature, have malignity enough in them to deſerve thoſe Sufferings that thou now art under; and it was the Patience of God towards thee that they were thus long before they bore their fruit, when thou art in a better condition to make uſe of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, than thou wert ſhortly after their commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: And it may be thy Repentance, even for thoſe long paſt tranſgreſſions, was not particular or deep enough, and it is no loſs of time or labour to thee to mourn again over thy ſtale tranſgreſſions: but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever let it be thy care to ſearch thy ſelf, it will make thee better acquainted with thy ſelf. If thou find a ſin not deeply enough ſorrowed for, thy affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction hath deſerved well at thy hands; and if thou find it not, yet thy affliction is well recompenſed by giving thee an opportunity to diſcover that to thy ſelf, which contents thy Conſcience more valuably than thy affliction hath done thee prejudice. 2. To
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:50435:267"/>
acknowledge the Sovereignty of God, and to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to his Will with an obedient Patience: 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.18. <hi>It is the Lord, let him do what ſeemeth him good.</hi> Pſal. 39.9. <hi>I was dumb and opened not my mouth, becauſe thou didſt it.</hi> Jer. 18.6. <hi>Behold, as the clay is in the hand of the potter, ſo are ye in my hands.</hi> Though thou canſt not ſee a cauſe for thy afflictions that might ſignally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it, nor canſt ſee an end in it; yet thou canſt not chuſe but find a uſe of it to teach thee with Wiſdom to acknowledge, and with Patience to ſubmit unto the moſt juſtly unlimited Power and Authority of the Almighty God over the Work of his own hands, and to put thy mouth in the duſt, and to wait for him and upon him, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.28, 29. till he give an expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed End, <hi>Jer.</hi> 29.11. 3. To depend and reſt upon his Mercy and Goodneſs for deliverance from, or ſtrength and comfort in thy Affliction. As the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is eſſentially dependent upon God, ſo it is its Duty and Perfection; and he uſeth the abſence of external confidences and comforts, upon which we are moſt apt to reſt, to call man to his duty, to fix his heart upon him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112.7. External Conflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences many times rob God of that Love and that Dependence we owe to him, and if the loſs or want of them ſend thy Love and Confidence to him, to whom it belongs, thou art no loſer by thy loſs. 4. To walk more ſtrictly and vigilantly with God. Though thou canſt not upon thy Examination find a cauſe of thy croſs, that may eminently diſcover it ſelf in it, yet thou canſt not chuſe but know thou art far ſhort of that Duty and degree of Perfection in thy heart and life, which by that aſſiſtance of his Grace that thou haſt, thou mayeſt arrive unto: thy affliction, though it put thee not in mind of any notable ſin, which ſhould humble thee, it may very well put thee
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:50435:267"/>
in mind of thy neglects and want of intention in thy duty. 5. Though thy Diſeaſe needs not this Phyſick to cure thee, yet thy Corruption needs it to prevent thee: thou haſt within thee a Fountain of Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that, were they not reſtrained or allayed, would upon a ſmall opportunity turn to a deſperate diſeaſe in thy Soul; and thoſe Corruptions of thine live and feed upon external ſuperfluities and ſupplies; and the Wiſe God foreſees, it may be, that in a month or two, or more or leſs, thy full Enjoyments would ripen this or that corruption into a diſtemper, that might be dangerous, if not fatal to thy Soul; and he ſends this Meſſenger to abate, or allay, or divert, or croſs, or weaken this corruption, to put in a little Wormwood into thy ſweet Cup, that thou mayeſt take it with more moderation, and not ſo greedily; to throw ſome dirt upon thy ſelf-opinion or growing pride, that may ſpoil the growth of it; to give a check to thy deſires of external Wealth or Greatneſs, which without it would in a little time ſwell into a ſtark Ambition or Covetouſneſs. The Evangeliſt tells us, thar <hi>All that is in the world is the Luſt of the Fleſh, the Luſt of the Eyes, and the Pride of Life:</hi> that is, thoſe Luſts that are in us faſten upon their ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble objects in the World, and upon them they live and grow ſtrong, and are thereby the better enabled to fight againſt our Souls; and God ſhews as much Mercy when he takes away their food, and ſtarves them by an affliction, as when he pardons them: Therefore learn by thy affliction the Mind of God in this alſo; and bleſs him as well for an affliction that prevents thee from ſin, as for one that leads thee to repentance. 6. It may be God hath ſome extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary work to do for thee or by thee, prepares thee by thoſe afflictions with humility that thou mayſt be a fit Inſtrument for his Glory, or a fit Veſſel for his
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:50435:268"/>
Bounty: A ſudden acceſs of Greatneſs, or Wealth, or Power, or Eminence is apt to make thy Nature ſwell and look big and deny God, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.9. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he prepares thee with the ſenſe of his hand to ſhew how he can, when he pleaſeth, handle thee with the experience of the benefit of Dependance upon him, with a condition that may teach thee to wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>k humbly with him; otherwiſe thou wilt not be able to bear and to manage that condition, he intends to put thee in, with moderation, with his fear, with an eye unto him and to his Glory. Thus he prepared <hi>David</hi> for the Crown, <hi>Job</hi> for Wealth, the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> for <hi>Canaan,</hi> that they might receive and uſe it with Thankfulneſs, as from his hand; with Sobriety and Faithfulneſs, as in his preſence. 7. Howſoever it is of moſt certain and univerſal uſe to take off thy Love from this World, to preſent it to thee as it is, to take thee off from ſetting up Tabernacles and thy Reſt here, and to carry thy thoughts and thy deſires to thy home and to thy Country, and to make the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of it frequent and ſweet, and that upon which thou reckoneſt, to make thy paſſage through death eaſie and comfortable, when thou ſhalt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch thoughts as theſe:
<q>I am in a body full of pains and weakneſſes and diſeaſes, ſo that I have much ado to keep up my Cottage to be comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or uſeful to me, but am buſied every day to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derprop it and repair it, that it fall not; and when I have done my beſt, yet Old Age will come, and that will be an irreparable decay, and my anxious life will moſt ſurely be attended with a certain death; I live in a World full of labour at the beſt to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide neceſſaries for my ſupport in a World full of troubles, dangers, and calumnies. If my outward contentments increaſe, yet my cares and my fears, increaſe with them: But my condition is not ſuch,
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:50435:268"/>
but with the Pſalmiſt I have cauſe to ſay, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.14. <hi>All the day long have I been plagued and chaſtned eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry morning;</hi> and, like <hi>Noah</hi>'s Dove, I can find here no reſt for the ſoal of my foot. My walk here is like a pilgrimage, and my path is not plain and eaſie, but narrow and deep and troubleſom; on either hand of me I paſs through the ſcorns and injuries and vexations of the men of this World: who if I want, will not relieve me, and if I have any thing, they are ready to tear it from me; and my way, which of it ſelf is thus troubleſom, is accompanied with Storms, and Stumbling-blocks, and fiery Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults raiſed by the Prince of this World; and if I take up a lodging by the way, it is neither a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing nor a ſafe lodging; my dangers and difficulties are greater in my Inn than they are in my Journey. To what purpoſe go I about to ſet up my reſt, or to build Tabernacles here? The time I can ſtay will be but ſhort, and my ſhort ſtay in ſuch a World as this cannot be pleaſing nor comfortable: and this is not my home, but I ſee it at a diſtance, I find it as it were in Landskips, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. the Tabernacle of God, where he ſhall wipe away all tears from mine eyes, and there ſhall be no more death, neither ſorrow, nor crying, neither ſhall there be any more pain: and then theſe my light afflictions, which are here but for a moment, ſhall be rewarded with an eternal weight of Glory. In the confidence and ſtrength of this expectation I will hold on my trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſom Journey with chearfulneſs, and look upon this World as the place of my pilgrimage, not of my reſt: and the unpleaſingneſs of my pilgrimage ſhall heighten, if it be poſſible, the expectation as well as the fruition of my home; and the more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcome the World is to me, and I to it, the more ſhall my heart undervalue and diſeſteem it, and ſend
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:50435:269"/>
forth my deſires the more earneſtly for my Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney's end, teach me to welcome death, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be diſſolved and to be with Chriſt, which is beſt of all.</q>

                  <p n="3">3. Sometimes external troubles are in themſelves an expreſs token of the Love of God, and they carry with them comfort and delight; namely, when it is a Perſecution for Righteouſneſs ſake: and in thoſe both the Precepts of Chriſt and the Pattern of his Diſciples command us up to rejoycing, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.10, 11, 12. <hi>Rejoyce and be exceeding glad.</hi> Jam. 1.1, 2. <hi>Count it all joy.</hi> Acts 5.41. <hi>Rejoycing that they were accounted worthy to ſuffer ſhame for his Name.</hi> Coloſſ. 1.24. <hi>Who now rejoyce in my ſufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Chriſt in my fleſh.</hi>

That, which in another People would be a Sin, is in thee Rebellion and Apoſtaſie. <hi>Admah</hi> and <hi>Zeboim</hi> were a People that knew me not, that never entred into Covenant with me, they had no light to guide them but that of Nature, and when they ſinned, my wrath broke out in the moſt eminent Judgment that ever was heard of: But thou haſt been a Vine of my own planting, and watering, and dreſſing, and yet
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:50435:270"/>
thy fruit hath been the fruit of <hi>Sodom;</hi> thou haſt made me to ſerve with thy ſins, and according to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thy Cities were thy Gods, O <hi>Iſrael:</hi> Jer. 11.13. <hi>Hear, O Heavens, and give ear, O Earth, for the Lord hath ſpoken; I have nouriſhed and brought up children, and they have rebelled againſt me.</hi> Iſa. 1.3.

And how canſt thou after all this expect any thing from me, but that my Wrath ſhould burn againſt thee like fire, till thou wert conſumed, and that I ſhould ſtir up all the fury of my Jealouſie towards you? O, but <hi>Ephraim,</hi> I am God, and not man, and therefore ye Sons of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> are not conſumed; my Mercy and my Patience are not the narrow qualities or habits of a mortal Man, but the infinite Attributes of an Infinite God. Though I can ſee nothing in thee, but what deſerves my wrath, I can find that in my ſelf, that ſends out my compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a heart turned by returning upon my own Mercy, and repentings kindled upon the conſiderations of my own Covenant with thy Fathers, kindled by a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, that thou little thinkeſt of, even the Sacrifice of my own Son: I will not therefore execute the fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of my anger: although it be thy duty to repent, Sinner, yet I will repent of my wrath even before thou repent of thy ſin: it may be my long-ſufferings will, as
