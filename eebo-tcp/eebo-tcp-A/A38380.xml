         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>I do tell them ſo, <hi>England</hi> was never an Elective Kingdom, but an Hereditary Kingdom for neer theſe thouſand years, therefore let me know by what Authority I am called hither: I do ſtand more for the Liberty of my People than any here, that come to be my pretended Judges: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let me know by what lawful Authority I am ſeated here, and I will anſwer it, otherwiſe I will not anſwer it.</p>

                  <p>Sir, how really you have managed your Truſt, is known: your way of anſwer is to interrogate the Court, which beſeems not you in this condition. You have been told of it twice, or thrice.</p>

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51765:11"/>
to the Court; I will ſtand as much for the priviledge of the Houſe of Commons, rightly underſtood, as any man here whatſoever. I ſee no Houſe of Lords here that may conſtitute a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and (the King too) ſhould have been. Is this the bringing of the King to his Parliament? Is this the bringing an end to the Treaty in the publick faith of the world? Let me ſee a legal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority warranted by the Word of God, the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, or warranted by the Conſtitutions of the Kingdom, and I will anſwer.</p>

                  <speaker>Preſident.</speaker>
                  <p>Sir, You have propounded a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, and have been anſwered: ſeeing you will not anſwer, the Court will conſider how to proceed; in the mean time, thoſe that brought you hither, are to take charge of you back again.</p>
                  <p>The Court deſires to know whether this be all the Anſwer you will give, or no.</p>

                  <speaker>King.</speaker>
                  <p>Sir, I deſire that you would give me, and all the world, ſatisfaction in this; let me tell you, it is not a ſlight thing you are about. I am ſworn to keep the Peace by that duty I owe to God and my Country<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and I will do it to the laſt breath of my body, and therefore you ſhall do well to ſatisfie firſt God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then the Country, by what Authority you do it; if you do it by a uſurped Authority, that will not laſt long. There is a God in Heaven that will call you, and all that give you power, to account: Satisfie me in that, and I will anſwer, otherwiſe I betray my Truſt, and the Liberties of the People, and therefore think of that, and then I ſhall be willing. For I do avow, That it is as great a ſin to withſtand lawful Authority, as it is to ſubmit to a Tyrannical, or any other wayes unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Authority; and therefore ſatisfie God, and me,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:51765:12"/>
and all the World in that, and you ſhall receive my Anſwer: I am not afraid of the Bill.</p>

                  <speaker>Preſident.</speaker>
                  <p>The Court expects you ſhould give them a final Anſwer, their purpoſe is to adjourn till Monday next, if you do not ſatisfie your ſelf, though we do tell you our Authority; we are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with our Authority, and it is upon Gods Authority and the Kingdoms, and that peace you ſpeak of will be kept in the doing of Juſtice, and that's our preſent work.</p>

                  <hi>Two things were remarkable in this days proceedings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. It is obſerved, That as the charge was reading againſt the King, the ſilver head of his ſtaff fell off, the which he wondred at, and ſeeing none to take it up, he ſtoop'd for it himſelf, and put it in his pocket.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That as the King was going away, he looking with a very auſtere countenance upon the Court, without ſtirring of his Hat, replyed, <hi>Well Sir,</hi> (when the <hi>L. Preſident</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Guard to take him away) and at his going down, he ſaid, <hi>I do not fear that,</hi> (pointing with his ſtaff at the ſword.) The people in the Hall, as he went down the ſtairs cryed out, ſome, <hi>God ſave the King,</hi> and ſome for <hi>Juſtice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O yes being called, the Court adjourned till Monday next, <hi>January</hi> 22. at 9. in the morning to the Painted Chamber, and from thence to the ſame place again in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Hall.</p>

                  <p>May it pleaſe your Lordſhip, my Lord Preſident, I did at the laſt Court in the behalf of the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> exhibit and give into this Court a Charge of High Treaſon, and other high Crimes, againſt the Priſoner at the Bar, whereof I do accuſe him in the name of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>England,</hi> and the Charge was read unto him, and his Anſwer required. My Lord, he was not then pleaſed to give an Anſwer, but in ſtead of anſwering, did there diſpute the Authority of this High Court. My humble Motion to this High Court, in behalf of the People of <hi>England,</hi> is, That
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:51765:13"/>
the Priſoner may be directed to make a poſitive Anſwer, either by way of Confeſſion or Negation; which if he ſhall refuſe to do, that the matter of Charge may be taken <hi>pro confeſſo,</hi> and the Court may proceed according to juſtice.</p>

                  <p>Sir, You may remember at the laſt Court, you were told the occaſion of your being brought hither, and you heard a Charge againſt you, containing a Charge of high Treaſon, and other high Crimes, againſt this Realm of <hi>England</hi>; you heard likewiſe that it was prayed in the behalf of the People, that you ſhould give an anſwer to that Charge, that thereupon ſuch proceedings might be had, at ſhould be agreeable to juſtice; you were then pleaſed to make ſome ſcruples concerning the Authority of this Court, and knew not by what Authority you were brought hither; you did di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers times propound your Queſtions, and were as often anſwered, that it was by Authority of the <hi>Commons of England aſſembled in Parliament,</hi> that did think fit to call you to account for thoſe high and capital miſdemeanours wherewith you were then charged. Since that, the Court hath taken into Conſideration what you then ſaid, they are fully ſatisfied with their own Authority, and they hold it fit you ſhould ſtand ſatisfied with it too; and they do require it, that you do give a poſitive and particular Anſwer to this Charge that is exhibited againſt you, they do expect you ſhould either confeſs or deny it; if you deny, it is offered in the behalf of the Nation to be made good againſt you; their Authority they do avow to the whole world, that the whole Kingdome are to reſt ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in, and you are to reſt ſatisfied with it, and therefore you are to loſe no more time, but to give a poſitive Anſwer thereunto.</p>

                  <speaker>King.</speaker>
                  <p>When I was here laſt, 'tis true, I made that Queſtion, and truly if it were only my own particular caſe, I would have ſatisfied my ſelf with the Proteſtation, I made the laſt time I was here againſt the legality of this Court, and that a King cannot be tryed by any Superiour Juriſdiction on Earth; but it is not my caſe alone, it is the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and the Liberty of the people of <hi>England,</hi> and do you pretend what you will, I ſtand more for their Liberties. For if power without Law, may make Laws, may alter the fundamental Laws of the Kingdome, I do not know what Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject he is in <hi>England,</hi> that can be ſure of his life, or any thing that he calls his own; therefore when that I came here, I did expect particular Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to know by what Law, what Authority you did proceed againſt me here, and therefore I am a little to ſeek what to ſay to you in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, becauſe the Affirmative is proved, the Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive often is very hard to do: but ſince I cannot perſwade you to do it, I ſhall tell you my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as ſhort as I can.</p>

                  <p>Sir, I muſt interrupt you, you may not be permitted, you ſpeak of Law and Reaſon, it is fit there ſhould be Law and Reaſon, and there is both againſt you. Sir the Vote of the Commons of <hi>England</hi> Aſſembled in Parliament, it is the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Kingdome, and they are theſe too that have given that Law, according to which you ſhould have ruled and reigned.

               <p>THis day the King being withdrawn from the Bar of the High Court of Juſtice, the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners of the ſaid High Court of Juſtice ſate pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate in the Painted Chamber, and conſidered of the Kings carriage upon the <hi>Saturday</hi> before, and of all that had then paſſed, and fully approved of what the <hi>Lord Preſident</hi> had done and ſaid in the managing of the buſineſſe of that day, as agreeing to their ſenſe.

               <p>This is now the third time that by the great grace and favour of this High Court, the Priſoner hath been brought to the Bar, before any iſſue joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Cauſe. My Lord, I did at the firſt Court exhibit a Charge againſt him, containing the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Treaſon that ever was wrought upon the Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre of <hi>England:</hi> that a King of <hi>England,</hi> truſted to keep the Law, That had taken an Oath ſo to do, That had Tribute paid him for that end, ſhould be guilty of a wicked deſign, to ſubvert and deſtroy our Lawes, and introduce an Arbitrary, and Tyrannical

Government, in the defence of the Parliament and their Authority, ſet up his Standard for War againſt his Parliament and People, and I did humbly pray, in the behalf of the people of <hi>England</hi>; that he might ſpeedily be required to make an Anſwer to the Charge.</p>
               <p>But my Lord, in ſtead of making any Anſwer, he did then diſpute the Authority of this High Court, your Lordſhip was pleaſed to give him a further day to conſider, and to put in his Anſwer, which day being yeſterday, I did humbly move, that he might be required to give a direct and poſitive Anſwer, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by denying, or confeſſion of it; but (my Lord) he was then pleaſed for to demur to the jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Court, which the Court did then over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule, and command him to give a direct and poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Anſwer. My Lord, beſides this great delay of juſtice, I ſhall now humbly move your Lordſhip for ſpeedy judgement againſt him.

Sir, you may well remember, and if you do not, the Court cannot forget, what delatory dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings the Court hath found at your hands, you were pleaſed to propound ſome Queſtions, you have had your Reſolutions upon them. You were told over and over again, That the Court did affirm their own juriſdiction: That it was not for you, nor any other man, to diſpute the <hi>Jurisdiction of the Supreme and higheſt Authority of England,</hi> from which there is no appeal, and touching which there muſt be no diſpute; yet you did perſiſt in ſuch carriage, as you gave no manner of obedience, nor did you acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge any Authority in them, nor the <hi>High Court, that conſtituted this Court of Juſtice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sir, I muſt let you know from the Court, That they are very ſenſible of theſe delayes of yours, and that they ought not, being thus Authorized by the ſupreme <hi>Court of England,</hi> to be thus trifled withall, and that they might in juſtice, if they pleaſed, and according to the Rules of juſtice, take advantage of theſe delayes, and proceed to pronounce judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt you; yet nevertheleſſe they are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to give direction, and on their behalfs I do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire you, that you make a poſitive Anſwer unto

this Charge that is againſt you: Sir, in plain terms, for Iuſtice knows no reſpect of perſons, you are to give your poſitive and finall Anſwer in plain En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, whether you be guilty or not guilty of theſe Treaſons laid to your Charge.</p>

But Sir, I muſt let you know from the Court, as their commands, that you are not to be permitted to iſſue out into any other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, till ſuch time as you have given a poſitive Anſwer concerning the <hi>Matter</hi> that is <hi>Charged</hi> upon you.</p>

                  <p>For the <hi>Charge</hi> I value it not a Ruſh, it is the <hi>Liberty</hi> of the People of <hi>England</hi> that I ſtand for; for me to acknowledge a new <hi>Court,</hi> that I never heard of before, I that am your King, that ſhould be an example to all the people of <hi>England,</hi> for to uphold Iuſtice, to maintain the old Laws; indeed I do not know how to do it; you ſpoke very well the firſt day that I came here, (on Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day)

               <p>HAving already made My proteſtations, not only againſt the illegality of this pretended Court, but alſo that no Earthly power can juſtly call Me (who am your King) in queſtion as a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent;

I would not any more open My mouth upon this occaſion, more than to refer My ſelfe to what I have ſpoken, were I in this caſe alone con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. But the duty I owe to God in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the true liberty of My people, will not ſuffer me at this time to be ſilent. For, how can any free-born Subject of <hi>England,</hi> call Life, or any thing he poſſeſſeth, his own; if Power without Right daily make new, and abrogate the old fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall Law of the Land? which I now take to be the preſent caſe. Wherefore, when I came hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I expected that you would have endevoured to have ſatisfied Me, concerning theſe grounds which hinder me to anſwer to your pretended Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment; but ſince I ſee that nothing I can ſay will move you to it (though Negatives are not ſo naturally proved as Affirmatives) yet I will ſhew you the Reaſon why I am confident you cannot judge Me, not indeed the meaneſt man in <hi>England</hi>; for, I will not (like you) without ſhewing a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſeek to impoſe a belief upon My Subjects. <note n="*" place="margin">Hereabout the King was ſtopt, and not ſufferd to ſpeak any more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Reaſon.</note> There is no proceeding juſt againſt any Man, but what is warranted ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Gods Laws, or the municipal Laws of the Countrey where he lives.

But how the Houſe of Commons can erect a Court of Iudicature, which was never one it ſelf (as is well known to all Lawyers) I leave to God and the World to judge: And it were full as ſtrange that they ſhould pretend to make Lawes without King or Lords Houſe, to any that have heard ſpeak of the Lawes of <hi>England.</hi>

do not onely violate, but likewiſe occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the greateſt breach of their publick Faith that (I believe ever was heard of; with which I am far from charging the two Houſes: for all the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded crimes laid againſt Me, bear date long before this late Treaty at <hi>Newport,</hi> in which I having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, as much as in Me lay, and hopefully expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the Houſes agreement thereunto, I was ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ſurprized, &amp; hurried from thence as a Priſoner upon which account I am againſt My will brought hither; where ſince I am come, I cannot but to my power defend the ancient Lawes and Liberties of this Kingdome, together with my own juſt right. Then, for any thing I can ſee, the higher Houſe is totally excluded. And for the Houſe of Commons, it is too well known, that the major part of them are detained or deterred from ſitting; ſo as if I had no other, this were ſufficient for Me to proteſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the lawfulneſſe of your pretended Court. Beſides all this, the peace of the Kingdome is not the leaſt in My thoughts, and what hopes of ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is there, ſo long as Power reigns without rule or Law, changing the whole frame of that Government, under which this Kingdome hath flouriſhed for many hundred years, (nor will I ſay what will fall out, in caſe this lawleſſe unjuſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding againſt Me do go on) and believe it, the Commons of <hi>England</hi> will not thank you for this change, for they will remember how happy they have been of late yeares, under the reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the King My Father, and My Self, untill the beginning of theſe unhappy Troubles, and will have cauſe to doubt that they ſhall never be ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py under any new. And by this time it will be too ſenſibly evident, that the Armes I took up, were
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51765:21"/>
only to defend the fundamentall Laws of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, againſt thoſe who have ſuppoſed My power hath totally changed the antient Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Thus having ſhewed you briefly the Reaſons why I cannot ſubmit to your pretended Authority, without violating the truſt which I have from God, for the welfare and liberty of My people; I expect from you either clear Reaſons to convince My judgement, ſhewing Me that I am in an Error (and then truly I will anſwer) or that you will with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw your proceedings.</p>

                  <p>Gentlemen, it is well known to all, or moſt of you here preſent, That the Priſoner at the Bar hath been ſeveral times convented and brought before the Court to make Anſwer to a Charge of Treaſon and other high Crimes exhibited againſt him in the name of the People of <note place="margin">Here an honorable Lady interrupted the Court, (ſaying not halfe the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) but ſhe was ſoon ſilenced.</note> 
                     <hi>England</hi>; to which Charge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing required to Anſwer, he hath been ſo far from obeying the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the Court, by ſubmitting to their Juſtice, as he began to take upon him to offer reaſoning and debate unto the Authority of the Court, and of the higheſt Court that conſtituted them to try and judge him; but being over-ruled in that, and required to make his Anſwer, he was ſtill pleaſed to continue contuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and to refuſe to ſubmit or Anſwer: Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Court, that they may not be wanting to themſelves, to the truſt repoſed in them, nor that any mans wilfulneſſe prevent juſtice, they have thought fit to take the matter into their conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; They have conſidered of the contumacy, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51765:22"/>
of that confeſſion, which in Law doth ariſe upon that contumacy; They have likewiſe conſidered of the notoriety of the Fact charged upon the priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and upon the whole matter they are reſolved, and have agreed upon a Sentence to be now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt this priſoner: but in reſpect he doth deſire to be heard before the Sentence be read and pronounced, the Court hath reſolved that they will hear him; yet Sir, thus much I muſt tell you before-hand, which you have been minded of at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Courts; that if that you have to ſay be to offer any debate concerning juriſdiction, you are not to be heard in it, you have offered it formerly, and you have indeed ſtruck at the root, that is, the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and <hi>Supreme Authority of the Commons of England,</hi> which this Court will not admit a debate of, and which indeed is an irrational thing in them to do, being a Court that acts upon Authority derived from them, that they ſhould preſume to judge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Superiorty, from whom ther's no Appeal. But Sir, if you have any thing to ſay in defence of your ſelfe-concerning the matters charged, the Court hath given me command to let you know they will hear you.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>King.</speaker>
                  <p>Since that I ſee that you will not hear any thing of debate concerning that which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe I thought moſt material for the peace of the Kingdom, and for the Liberty of the Subject, I ſhall wave it, I ſhall ſpeak nothing to it; but onely I muſt tell you, That this many a day all things have been taken away from me, but that, that I call more dear to me then my Life, which is, <hi>My Conſcience and my Honour</hi>; and if I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to my life more then the Peace of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the <hi>Liberty of the Subject,</hi> certainly I ſhould
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51765:23"/>
have made a particular defence for my ſelf, for by that at leaſt-wiſe I might have delayed an ugly Sentence, which I believe will paſſe upon me; Therefore certainly Sir, as a Man that hath ſome underſtanding, ſome knowledge of the world, if that my true zeal to my Countrey had not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born the care that I have of my own preſervation, I ſhould have gone another way to work then that I have done: Now Sir, I conceive that an haſty Sentence once paſt, may be ſooner repented then recalled: and truly the ſelfe-ſame deſire that I have for <hi>the Peace of the Kingdome, and the Liberty of the Subject, more then my own particular,</hi> does make me now at laſt deſire, That having ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for to ſay that concerns both, I deſire before Sentence be given, that I may be heard in the Painted Chamber before the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, this delay cannot be prejudicial to you, whatſoever I ſay, if that I ſay no Reaſon, thoſe that hear me muſt be Judges, I cannot be Judge of that that I have; if it be Reaſon, and really for <hi>the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the Kingdome, and the Liberty of the Subject,</hi> I am ſure on it very well it is worth the hearing; Therefore I do conjure you, as you love that you pretend, I hope it is real, <hi>the Liberty of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, the Peace of the Kingdome</hi>; that you will grant Me the hearing, before any Sentence be paſſed, I only deſire this, that you will take this into your conſideration, it may be you have not heard of it before-hand, if you will, I'le retire, and you may think of it: but if I cannot get this <hi>Liberty,</hi> I do here proteſt, that ſo fair ſhews of <hi>Liberty and Peace</hi> are pure ſhews, and not otherwiſe, then that you will not hear your KING.</p>

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51765:24"/>
Court adjourned; Truly Sir, their withdrawing and adjournment was <hi>pro forma tantum,</hi> for it did not ſeem to them that there was any difficulty in the thing; they have conſidered of what you have moved, and have conſidered of their own Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which is founded, as hath been often ſaid, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Supreme Authority of the Commons of England aſſembled in Parliament.</hi> The Court acts accordingly to their Commiſſion: Sit, the return I have to you from the Court, is this, That they have been too much delayed by you already, and this that you now offer hath occaſioned ſome little further delay, and they are JUDGES appointed by the higheſt JUDGES, and <hi>Judges</hi> are no more to delay, then they are to deny juſtice, they are good words in the old Charter of <hi>England: Nulli negabimus, nulli vendemus, nulli deferemus Juſtitiam.</hi> There muſt be no delay; but the truth is, Sir, and ſo every man here obſerves it, That you have much delayed them in your contempt and default, for which they might have long ſince proceeded to judgement againſt you, and notwithſtanding what you have offered, they are reſolved to proceed to puniſhment, and to judgement, and that is their unanimous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution.</p>

                  <p>Sir, I know it is in vain for me to diſpute, I am no <hi>Sceptick</hi> for to deny the power that you have, I know that you have power enough; Sir, I confeſſe, I think it would have been for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes peace, if you would have taken the pains for to have ſhown the lawfulneſſe of your power, for this delay that I have deſired, I confeſſe it is a delay, but it is a delay very important for the peace of the Kingdome, for it is not my perſon that I look on alone, it is the Kingdomes wel-fare,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51765:25"/>
and the Kingdomes peace, it is an old ſentence, <hi>That we ſhould think on long, before we have reſolved of great matters ſuddenly</hi>; Therefore, Sir, I do ſay again, that I do put at your doors all the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency of an haſty Sentence. I confeſſe, I have been here now I think this week, this day eight dayes, was the day I came here firſt, but a little delay of a day or two further, may give peace, whereas an <hi>Haſty Judgement</hi> may bring on that trouble and perpetual inconveniency to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that the child that is unborn may repent it; and therefore again, out of the Duty I owe to God, and to my Country, I do deſire that I may be heard by the Lords and Commons in the <hi>Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Chamber,</hi> or any other Chamber that you will appoint me.</p>

                  <p>Sir, you ſpeak very well of a precious thing that you call Peace, and it had been much to be wiſhed that God had put it into your heart, that you had as effectually and really endevoured and ſtudied the Peace of the Kingdome, as now in words you ſeem to pretend<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but as you were told the other day, <hi>Actions muſt expound Intentions,</hi> yet Actions have been clean contrary, and truly Sir, it doth appear plainly enough to them, that you have gone upon very erronious principles, the Kingdome hath felt it to their ſmart, and it will be no eaſe to you to think of it, for Sir, you have held your ſelfe, and let fall ſuch Language, as if you had been no wayes ſubject to the Law, or that the Law had not been your Superiour. Sir, the Court is very well ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of it, and I hope ſo are all the underſtanding People of England, <hi>That the Law is your Superiour.</hi> That you ought to have ruled according to the Law, you ought to have done ſo Sir, I know very well your pretence hath been that you have done ſo, but Sir, the difference hath been who ſhall be the <hi>Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors of this Law</hi>; Sir, whether you and your party out of Courts of Juſtice, ſhall take upon them to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Law, or the <hi>Courts of Juſtice,</hi> who are the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounders; nay, the Soveraign and <hi>the High Court of Juſtice,</hi> the <hi>Parliament of England,</hi> who are not only <hi>the higheſt Expounders,</hi> but <hi>the ſole makers of the Law.</hi> Sir, for you to ſet your ſelf with your ſingle judgement, and thoſe that adhere unto you, againſt

                     <hi>the higheſt Court of Juſtice, that is not Law</hi>: Sir, as the Law is your ſuperior, ſo truly Sir, there is ſomething that is ſuperior to the Law, and that is indeed the <hi>Parent or Author</hi> of the Law, and that is <hi>the People of England.</hi> For Sir, as they are thoſe that at the firſt, (as other Countries have done) did chuſe to themſelves the <hi>Form of Government,</hi> even for juſtice ſake, that juſtice might be adminiſtred, that peace might be preſerved; ſo Sir, they gave Laws to their Governors, according to which they ſhould govern; and if thoſe Laws ſhould have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved inconvenient, or prejudicial to the publick, they had a power in them, and reſerved to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to alter as they ſhall ſee cauſe. Sir, it is very true, what ſome of your ſide have ſaid, <hi>Rex non habet parem in Regno</hi>; This Court will ſay the ſame, while <hi>King, That you have not your Peer</hi> in ſome ſenſe, for you are <hi>Major ſingulis,</hi> but they will aver again, that you are <hi>Minor univerſis</hi>; and the ſame Author tells you, that <hi>in exhibitione juris,</hi> there you have no power, but in  <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">

good, as the <hi>Barons</hi> of <hi>England</hi> will not be unmindfull of what is for their preſervation, and for their ſafety, <hi>Juſtitiae fruendi cauſa Reges conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuti ſunt.</hi> This we learn the end of having Kings, or any other Governors, it's for the enjoying of Juſtice, that's the end. Now Sir, if ſo be the King will go contrary to the end of his Government; Sir, he muſt underſtand that he is but an Officer of truſt, and he ought to diſcharge that Truſt, and they are to take order for the animadverſion and puniſhment of ſuch an offending Governor.</p>
                  <p>This is not Law of yeſterday Sir, (ſince the time of the diviſion betwixt you and your People,) but it is Law of old; And we know very well the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors</hi> and <hi>Authorities</hi> that do tell us what the Law was in that point upon the Election of Kings, upon the <hi>Oath</hi> that they took unto their People, and if they did not obſerve it, there were thoſe things cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Parliaments; The <hi>Parliaments</hi> were they that were to adjudge (the very words of the <hi>Author) the plaints and wrongs done of the King and Queen, or their Children, ſuch wrong eſpecially, when the People could have no where elſe any remedy.</hi> Sir, that hath been the People of <hi>Englands</hi> caſe, they could not have their remedy elſewhere but in <hi>Parliament.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sir, <hi>Parliaments</hi> were ordained for that purpoſe, to redreſſe the grievances of the People, that was their main end; and truly Sir, if ſo be that the Kings of <hi>England</hi> had been rightly mindfull of themſelves, they were never more in <hi>Majeſty and State</hi> then in the <hi>Parliament:</hi> but how forgetfull ſome have been, <hi>Stories</hi> have told us; We have a miſerable, a lamentable, a ſad experience of it, Sir, by the old Laws of <hi>England,</hi> I ſpeak theſe things the rather to you, becauſe you were pleaſed to let fall

the other day, you thought you had as much know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the Law, as moſt Gentlemen in <hi>England,</hi> it is very well Sir. And truly Sir, it is very good for the Gentlemen of <hi>England</hi> to underſtand that Law under which they muſt live, and by which they muſt be governed. And then Sir, the <hi>Scripture</hi> ſays, <hi>They that know their Maſters will and do it not,</hi> what followes. The Law is your Maſter, the Acts of <hi>Parliament.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Paliaments</hi> were to be kept antiently, we finde in our <hi>author</hi> twice in the year, <hi>That the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject upon any occaſion, might have a ready remedy and redreſſe for his Grievance.</hi> Afterwards, by ſeveral Acts of <hi>Parliament</hi> in the dayes of your Predeceſſor <hi>Edward the third,</hi> they muſt have been once a year. Sir what intermiſſion of PARLIAMENTS hath been in your time, it is very well known, and the ſad conſequences of it, and what in the interim in ſtead of theſe Parliaments, hath been by you by an high and <hi>Arbitrary</hi> hand introduced upon the People, that likewiſe hath been too well known and felt. But when God by his Providence had ſo brought it about, that you could no longer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the calling of a Parliament. Sir, yet it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare what your ends were againſt the Antient, and your <hi>Native</hi> Kingdome of <hi>Scotland:</hi> The <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> not ſerving your ends againſt them, you were pleaſed to diſſolve it. Another great neceſſity occaſioned the calling of this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and what your deſignes and plots and indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours all along have been for the ruining and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding of this Parliament, hath been very noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to the whole Kingdome; And truly Sir, in that you did ſtrike at all; that had been a ſure way to have brought about that, that this laies upon you,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51765:27"/>
                     <hi>Your Intention to Subvert the Fundamental Laws of the Land.</hi> For the great bulwark of <hi>Liberty of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> in the PARLIAMENT of <hi>England</hi>; and to Subvert and Root up that, which your aim hath been to do, certainly at one blow you had confounded the Liberties and the propriety of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Truly Sir, it makes me call to minde, I cannot forbear to expreſſe it, for Sir, we muſt deal plainly with you, according to the merits of your cauſe, ſo is our Commiſſion, it makes me call to minde (theſe proceedings of yours) that we read of a great <hi>Roman Emperor,</hi> by the way let us call him <hi>a great Roman Tyrant,</hi> Caligula, <hi>that wiſht that the People of</hi> Rome <hi>had bad but one neck, that at one blow he might cut it off</hi>: and your proceedings hath been ſomewhat like to this, for the body of the people of <hi>England</hi> hath been (and where elſe) repreſented but in the Parliament, and could you have but confounded that, you had at one blow cut off the neck of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland:</hi> but God hath reſerved better things for us, and hath pleaſed for to Confound your deſignes, and to break your Forces, and to bring your Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon into Cuſtody, that you might be reſponſible to Juſtice.</p>
                  <p>Sir, we know very well, That it is a queſtion on your ſide very much preſt, <hi>by what Precedent we ſhall proceed?</hi> Truly Sir, for <hi>Precedents,</hi> I ſhall not upon theſe occaſions inſtitute any long diſcourſe, but it is no new thing to cite <hi>Precedents</hi> almoſt of all <hi>Nations,</hi> where the people (when power hath been in their hands) have been made bold to call their Kings to account, and where the change of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> hath upon occaſion of the <hi>Tyranny and Miſ-government</hi> of thoſe that have been placed over

them; I will not ſpend time to mention <hi>France,</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> or the Empire, or other Countries, Volumes may be written of them But truly Sir, that of the Kingdome of <hi>Arragon,</hi> I ſhall think ſome of us have thought upon it, when they have the juſtice of <hi>Arragon,</hi> that is a man <hi>tanquam in medio poſitus,</hi> betwixt the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the people of the Country, that if wrong be done by the King, he that is the King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> the Juſtice hath power to reform the wrong, and he is acknowledged to be the Kings Superior, and is the grand preſerver of their priviledges, and hath proſecuted Kings upon their miſcarriages.</p>
                  <p>Sir, What the Tribunes of <hi>Rome</hi> were hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and what the <hi>Ephory</hi> were to the <hi>Lacedaemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian State,</hi> we know that is the Parliament of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> to the <hi>Engliſh State</hi>; and though <hi>Rome</hi> ſeem to have loſt its <hi>liberty</hi> when once the Emperours were, yet you ſhall finde ſome famous Acts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice even done by the Senate of <hi>Rome,</hi> that great <hi>Tyrant</hi> of his time, <hi>Nero,</hi> condemned and judged by the <hi>Senate.</hi> But truly Sir, to you I ſhould nor men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion theſe Forreign examples and ſtories.

Sir, if I ſhould come to what your ſtories make mention of, you know
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:51765:28"/>
very well you are the 109 King of <hi>Scotland</hi>; for to mention ſo many Kings as that Kingdome accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their power and priviledge, have made bold to deal withall, ſome to baniſh, and ſome to impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and ſome to put to death, it would be too long; and as one of your Authors ſayes, it would be too long to recite the manifold examples that your own ſtories make mention of; <hi>Reges</hi> (ſay they) we do create, we created Kings at firſt, <hi>Leges</hi> &amp;c. We impoſed Lawes upon them; and as they are choſen by the ſuffrages of the People at the firſt, ſo upon juſt occaſion, by the ſame ſuffrages<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken down again: and we will be bold to ſay, that no Kingdome hath yeilded more plentiful experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence then that your Native Kingdome of <hi>Scotland</hi> hath done concerning the depoſition, and the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of their offending and tranſgreſſing Kings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is not far to go for an example neer you, your Grandmother ſet aſide, and your Father an Infant crowned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the State did it here in <hi>England,</hi> here hath not been a want of ſome examples, they have made bold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (the Parliament and the People of <hi>England</hi>) to call their Kings to account, there are frequent examples of it in the <hi>Saxons</hi> time the time before the Conqueſt; ſince the Conqueſt there wants not ſome Preſidents neither, King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, King <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, were dealt with ſo by the Parliament, as they were depoſed and deprived: and truly Sir, who ever ſhall look into their ſtories, they ſhall not finde the Articles that are charged upon them to come neer to that height and capitalneſſe of Crimes that are layed to your charge, nothing neer.</p>
                  <p>Sir, you were pleaſed to ſay the other day, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sir, what a grave and learned Judge in his time, &amp; well known to you, is ſince printed for poſterity, <hi>That although there was ſuch a thing as a Deſcent many times, yet the Kings of</hi> England <hi>ever held the greateſt aſſurance of their titles, when it was declared by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> And Sir, your <hi>Oath,</hi> the manner of your <hi>Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> doth ſhew plainly, That the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> and though it's true by the Law the next perſon in bloud is deſigned; yet if there were juſt cauſe to refuſe him, the People of <hi>England</hi> might do it. For there i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Theſe things may not be denyed Sir, I ſpeak it the rather, and I pray God it may work upon your

heart, that you may be ſenſible of your miſcarria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. For whether you have been, as by your Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice you ought to be, <hi>a Protector of</hi> England, or <hi>the Deſtroyer of</hi> England, let all <hi>England</hi> judge, or all the world that hath look'd upon it. Sir, though you have it by <hi>Inheritance</hi> in the way that is ſpoken of, yet it muſt not be denyed that your Office was an Office of Truſt, and an Office of the higheſt truſt lodged in any ſingle perſon; For as you were the grand <hi>Adminiſtrator of Juſtice,</hi> and others were as your <hi>Delegates</hi> to ſee it done throughout your Realms, if your great Office were to do Juſtice, and preſerve your People from wrong, and in ſtead of doing that you will be the <hi>great wrong-doer your ſelfe</hi>; If inſtead of being a <hi>Conſervator of the Peace,</hi> you will be <hi>the Grand Diſturber of the Peace,</hi> ſurely this is contrary to your Office, contrary to your Truſt. Now Sir, if it be an Office of <hi>Inheritance,</hi> as you ſpeak of your Title by <hi>Diſcent,</hi> let all men know, that great Offices are ſeizable ond forfeita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as if you had it but for a year, and for your life; Therefore Sir, it will concern you to take into your ſerious conſideration your great miſcarriages in this kinde.</p>
                  <p>Truly Sir, I ſhall not particularize the many miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages of your Reign whatſoever, they are fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly known, it had been happy for the Kingdom, and happy for you too, if it had not been ſo much known, and ſo much felt, as the ſtory of your miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages muſt needs be, and hath been already.</p>
                  <p>Sir, That that we are now upon by the command of the <hi>higheſt Court,</hi> hath been &amp; is to try and judge you for great offences of yours. Sir, the Charge hath called you <hi>Tyrant, a Traytor, a Murtherer, and a publick Enemy to the Common-wealth of</hi> England.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:51765:30"/>
Sir, it had been well, if that any of all theſe termes might rightly and juſtly have been ſpared, if any one of them at all.</p>

                  <p>Truly Sir, we have been told, <hi>Rex eſt dum bene regit, Tyrannus qui populum opprimei</hi>; and if ſo be, that be the definition of a Tyrant, then ſee how you come ſhort of it in your Actions, whether the higheſt Tyrant by that way of Arbitrary Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and that you have ſought to introduce, and that you have ſought to put, you were putting upon the People, whether that was not as high an Act of Tyranny, as any of your Predeceſſors were guilty of, nay many degrees beyond it.</p>
                  <p>Sir, the term Traytor cannot be ſpared, we ſhall eaſily agree it muſt denote and ſuppoſe a breach of Truſt, and it muſt ſuppoſe it to be done by a Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, and therefore Sir, as the People of <hi>England</hi> might have incurred that reſpecting you, if they had been truly guilty of it, as to the definition of Law: ſo on the other ſide, when you did break your Truſt to the Kingdome, you did break your Truſt to your Superior: For the Kingdom is that for which you were truſted: And therefore Sir, for this breach of Truſt when you are called to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, you are called to account by your Superiors. <hi>Minimus ad Majorem in judicium vocat.</hi> And Sir, the <hi>People of England</hi> cannot be ſo far wanting to themſelves, which God having dealt ſo miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly &amp; gloriouſly for, they having power in their hands and their great Enemy, they muſt proceed to do Juſtice to themſelves and to you? For, Sir, the Court could heartily deſire, That you would lay your hand upon your heart and conſider what you have done amiſs, That you would endevour to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:51765:30"/>
make your peace with God. Truly Sir, Theſe are your high crimes, Tyranny and Treaſon.</p>
                  <p>There is a third thing too, if thoſe had not been, and that is Murther, which is layd to your charge. All the bloody Murthers that have been commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſince this time that the deviſion was betwixt you and your People, muſt be laid to your charge, that have bean acted or committed in theſe late Wars. Sir, it is an heinous and crying ſin; and truly Sir, if any man will ask us what puniſhment is due to a Murtherer, Let Gods Law, let Mans Law, ſpeak. Sir, I will preſume that you are ſo well read in Scripture, as to know what God himſelf hath ſaid concerning <hi>the ſhedding of Mans blood, Gen.</hi> 9. <hi>Num.</hi> 35. will tell you what the puniſhment is, and which this Court in behalf of the Kingdome are ſenſible of, of that innocent blood that has been ſhed, whereby indeed the Land ſtands ſtill defiled with that blood, and as the Text hath it, <hi>It can no way be cleanſed, but with the ſhedding of the blood of him that ſhed this blood.</hi> Sir, we know no Diſpenſation from this blood in that Commandement, <hi>Thou ſhalt do no murther</hi>; we do not know but that it extends to Kings, as well as to the meaneſt Peaſants, the meaneſt of the People, the command is univerſall. Sir, Gods Law forbids it, Mans Law forbids it, nor do we know that there is any manner of exception, nor even in mans Laws, for the puniſhment of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in you. 'Tis true, that in the caſe of Kings, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very private hand was not to put forth it ſelf to this work for their Reformation and puniſhment. But Sir, the people repreſented having power in their hands, had there been but one wilfull act of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by you committed, had power to have conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:51765:31"/>But then Sir, the weight that lies upon you in all thoſe reſpects that have been ſpoken, by reaſon of your <hi>Tyranny, Treaſon, breach of truſt,</hi> and the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that have been committed, ſurely Sir, it muſt drive you into a ſad conſideration concerning your eternall condition: as I ſaid at firſt, I know it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be pleaſing to you to hear any ſuch things as theſe are mentioned unto you from this Court, for ſo we do call our ſelves, and juſtifie our ſelves to be a Court, and a <hi>High Court of Juſtice,</hi> authorized by the higheſt and ſolemneſt Court of the Kingdome, as we have often ſaid; and although you do yet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devour what you may to diſ-court us, yet we do take knowledge of our ſelves to be ſuch a Court as can adminiſter Juſtice to you, and we are bound, Sir, in duty to do it. Sir, all I ſhall ſay before the reading of your Sentence, it is but this; the Court does heartily deſire, that you will ſeriouſly think of thoſe evils that you ſtand guilty of. Sir, you ſaid well to us the other day, you wiſht us to have God before our eyes, Truly Sir, I hope all of us have ſo, that God that we know is a King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, that God with whom there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of perſons, that God that is the avenger of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent blood, we have that God before us, that God that does beſtow a curſe upon them that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold their hands from ſhedding of blood, which is the caſe of guilty Malefactors, and that do deſerve death; That God we have before our eyes, and were it not that the conſcience of our duty hath called us unto this place, and this imployment, Sir, you ſhould have had no appearance of a Court here: but Sir, we muſt prefer the diſcharge of our duty unto God, and unto the Kingdome, before any other reſpect whatſoever: and although at this
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51765:31"/>
time many of us, if not all of us, are ſeverely threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by ſome of your party, what they intend to do. Sir, we do here declare, that we ſhall not decline or forbear the doing of our duty in the adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Juſtice even to you, according to the merit of your offence, although God ſhould permit thoſe men to effect all that bloody deſigne in hand againſt us. Sir, we will ſay, and we will declare it, as thoſe Children in the fiery Furnace, that would not worſhip the golden Image that <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> had ſet up, <hi>That their God was able to deliver them from that danger that they were neer unto</hi>; but yet if he would not do it yet, notwithſtanding that, they would not fall down and worſhip the Image: we ſhall thus apply it, That though we ſhould not be delivered from thoſe bloody hands and hearts that conſpire the overthrow of the Kingdome in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, of us in particular, for acting in this great work of Juſtice, though we ſhould periſh in the work, yet by Gods grace, and by Gods ſtrength, we will go on with it: And this is all our Reſolutions. Sir, I ſay for your ſelf, we do heartily wiſh, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, that God would be pleaſed to give you a ſenſe of your ſins, that you would ſee wherein you have done amiſſe, that you may cry unto him, that God would deliver you from blood-guiltineſſe.

ſhal trouble you no longer, your ſins are ſo large a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſion, that if you do but ſeriouſly think of them, they will drive you to a ſad conſideration they may improve in you a ſad and ſerious repentance. And that the Court doth heartily wiſh that you may be ſo penitent for what you have done amiſs, that God may have mercy at leaſtwiſe upon your better part. Truly Sir, for the other, it is our parts and duties to do that, that the Law preſcribes we are not here <hi>Jui dare,</hi> but <hi>Jus dicere</hi>; We cannot be unmindful of what the Scripture tels us, For <hi>to acquit the guilty, is of equal abomination as to condemn the innocent</hi> we may not acquit the guilty; what Sentence the Law af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms to a Traytor, Tyrant a Murtherer, and a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Enemy to the Countrey, that Sentence you are now to hear read unto you, and that is the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Court.</p>

                  <p>Now (Sirs) I muſt ſhew you both how you are out of the way, and will put you in the way: firſt, you are out of the way, for certainly all the way you ever have had yet as I could find by any thing is in the way of conqueſt; certainly this is an ill way: for conqueſt (Sir) in my opinion is never juſt, except there be a good juſt Cauſe, either for matter of wrong or juſt Title, and then if you goe beyond it, the firſt quarrel that you have to it is it that makes it unjuſt at the end that was juſt at firſt: But if it be onely matter of Conqueſt, then it is a great Robbery, as a Pirat ſaid to <hi>Alexander,</hi> that he was the great Robber, he was but a petty Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: and ſo, Sir, I doe think the way that you are in, is much out of the way, Now, Sir, for to put you in one way, believe it you will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver do right, nor God will never proſper you, until you give God his due, the King his due (that is, my Succeſſors) and the people their due: I am as much for them as any of you: You muſt give God his due, by regulating rightly his Church (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Scriptures) which is now out of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: For to ſet you in a way particularly now I cannot, but onely this, <hi>A National Synod freely called,</hi> freely debating among themſelves, muſt ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle this: when that every Opinion is freely and clearly heard.</p>

                  <p>For the people: and truely I deſire their Liberty and freedom as much as any body who ſoever, but I muſt tell you that their Liberty and freedome conſiſts in having of government, thoſe Laws by which their Life and their Goods may be moſt their own. It is not for having ſhare in govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (Sir) that is nothing pertaining to them; A Subject and a Soveraign are clean different things, and therefore until they do that, I mean, That you do put the people in that Libertie as I ſay, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they will never enjoy themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Sir, It was for this that now I am come here: If I would have given way to an Arbitrarie way, for to have all Laws changed according to the power of the Sword, I needed not to have come here, and therefore I tell you (and I pray God it be not laid to your charge) that <hi>I am the Martyr of the people.</hi>

And if you thus uſe it, you will never want means to be a Father to all, and a bountiful Prince to any you would ba ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily gracious unto. You may perceive all men truſt their treaſure where it returns them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt: And if Princes, like the Sea, receive and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay all the freſh ſtreams and rivets truſt them with; they will nor grudge, but pride themſelves to make them up an Ocean. Theſe conſiderations may make you a great Prince, as your Father is now a low one; and your ſtate maybe ſo much the more eſtabliſhed, as mine hath been ſhaken. For Subjects have learnt (We dare ſay) that Victories over their Princes are but Triumphs over themſelves, and ſo will be more unwilling to hearken to changes hereafter. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation are a ſober People, however at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent under ſome infatuation. We know not but this may be the laſt time We may ſpeak to you or the world publickly; We are ſenſible into what hand We are faln, and yet We bleſs God, We have thoſe inward tefreſhments, that the malice of Our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies cannot perturb. We have learnt to own Our ſelf, by tetiting into Our ſelf, and therefore can the better digeſt what befals Us, not doubting but God
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:51765:41"/>
can reſtrain Our Enemies malice, and turn their fierceneſs into his praiſe. To conclude, if God give you ſucceſs, uſe it humbly and far from revenge: It he reſtore you to your Right upon hard conditions, what ever you promiſe, keep. Thoſe men which have forced Lawes which they were bound to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, will find their triumphs full of troubles. Do not think any thing in this World worth obtaining by foul and unjuſt means. You are the Son of Our love: and as We direct you to what we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to you, ſo we aſſure you, We do not more affectionatlely pray for you (to whom We are a natural Parent) then We doe, that the ancient glory and renown of this Nation, be not buried in irreligion and fanatick humour: And that all our Subjects (to whom we are a Politick Parent) may have ſuch ſober thoughts as to ſeek their Peace, in the Orthodox Profeſſion of the Chriſtian Religion, as it was eſtabliſhed ſince the Reformation in this Kingdome, and not in new Revelations: And that the ancient Lawes, with the Interpretation accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the known practiſes, may once again be an hedge about them, that you may in due time go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, and they be governed, as in the fear of the Lord.</p>

               <head>The Earl of <hi>Straffords</hi> Speech, or the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his Defence, before the Lord High Steward, and the reſt of the Lords ſitting in Weſtminſter Hall,
<hi>April</hi> 12. 1641.
To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with his Speech on the Scaffold im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately before his Execution on Tower-Hill,
<hi>May</hi> 12. 1641.</head>
               <p>MY Lords! There yet remains another Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that I ſhould be guilty of; the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to ſubvert the fundamental Lawes of the Land, that they ſhould now be Treaſon to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that is not Treaſon in any one part of Treaſon accumulative, that ſo when all will not do, it is woven up with others, it ſhould ſeem very ſtrange.</p>
               <p>Under favour my Lords, I do not conceive that there is either Statute Law, nor Common-Law, that doth declare the endeavouring to ſubvert the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall Laws to be high treaſon.</p>
               <p>For neither Statute Law, nor Common-Law written, that ever I could hear of, declareth it ſo.</p>
               <p>And yet I have been diligent to enquire, (as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve you think it doth not concern me to do.)</p>
               <p>It is hard to be queſtioned for life and honour up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Law that cannot be ſhown.</p>
               <p>There is a rule which I have learned from Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Cooke, De non apparentibus &amp; non exiſtentibus
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:51765:45"/>
eadem ratio:</hi> (Jeſu) where hath this fire lain all this while, ſo many hundreds of years, without any ſmoak to diſcover it, till it thus burſt out to conſume me and my children; extreme hard in my opinion, that puniſhment ſhould precede promulgation of Law, puniſhed by a Law ſubſequent to the Acts done.</p>
               <p>Take it into your conſiderations: for certainly it is now better to be under no Law at all, but the will of men, then to conform our ſelves under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of a Law as we think, and then be puniſhed for a crime that doth precede the Law: what man can be ſafe, if that be once admitted?</p>
               <p>My Lords, it is hard in another reſpect, that there ſhould be no token ſet upon this offence, by which we ſhould know it, no admonition by which we ſhould be aware of it.</p>
               <p>If a man paſſe down the Thames in a Boat and it be ſplit upon an Anchor; and no booy be ſet as a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken that there is an Anchor there, that party that owes the Anchor, by the Maritine Lawes ſhall give ſatisfaction for the dammage done; but if it were marked out, I muſt come upon my own peril.</p>
               <p>Now where is a mark upon this crime? Where is the token this is high treaſon?</p>
               <p>If it be under water, and not above water, no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane providence can availe nor prevent my deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>Lay aſide all humane wiſdom, and let us reſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on divine Revelation, if you will condemn before you forewarn the danger.</p>
               <p>Oh my Lords! may your Lordſhips be pleaſed to give that regard unto the Peerage of England, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to ſuffer our ſelves to be put on thoſe nice points upon ſuch contractive interpretations; and theſe are where Laws are not clear, or known. If there muſt
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:51765:45"/>
be a tryal of wits, I do humbly beſeech you, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and matter may be ſomewhat elſe then the lives and honours of Peers.</p>
               <p>My Lords, we find, that the primitive times, in the progreſſion of the plain Doctrine of the Apoſtles, they brought the Books of Curious Arts, and burned them. And ſo likewiſe as I do conceive, it will be wiſdom and providence in your Lordſhips, for your poſterity, and the whole Kingdom, to caſt from you into the fire theſe bloody and moſt myſterious Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes of conſtructive and Arbitrary Treaſon; and to break your ſelves to the plain Letters of the Law and Statute, that telleth us where the crime is, and by telling what is and what is not, ſhews us how to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void it. And let us not be ambitious, to be more wiſe and learned in the killing Arts, then our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers were.</p>
               <p>It is now full two hundred and forty years ſince ever any man was touched for this alledged crime (to this height) before my ſelf; we have lived hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily to our ſelves at home, and we have lived glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to the world abroad.</p>
               <p>Let us reſt contented with that our fathers left us, and not awaken thoſe ſleepy Lions to our own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions; by raking up a few muſty Records that have lyen ſo many ages by the walls, quite forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and neglected.</p>
               <p>May your Lordſhips be Nobly pleaſed, to adde this to thoſe other miſ-fortunes befallen me for my ſins, not for my Treaſons; that a preſident ſhould be derived from me of that diſadvantage (as this will be in the conſequent to the whole Kingdom) I beſeech you ſeriouſly to conſider it, and let not my particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar cauſe be looked upon as you do; though you wound me in my intereſt in the Common-wealth,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:51765:46"/>
and therefore thoſe Gentlemen ſay, that they ſpeak for the Common-wealth, yet in this particular I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſpeak for it, and the inconveniencies and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes that will heavily fall upon us; for as it is in the firſt of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, no man will after know what to do, or ſay for fear.</p>
               <p>Do not put my Lords ſo great difficulties upon the Miniſters of State, that men of wiſdome, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and vertue, may not with cheerfulneſſe and ſafety, be imployed for the publick; if you weigh and meaſure them by grains and ſcruples, the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick affaires of the Kingdome will be laid waſt, and no man will meddle with them, that hath honours, iſſues, or any fortunes to loſe.</p>
               <p>My Lords, I have now troubled you longer then I ſhould have done, were it not for the intereſt of thoſe dear pledges a Saint in heaven left me; I ſhould be loth my Lords; (there he ſtopped.)</p>
               <p>What I forfeit for my ſelf it is nothing, but that my indiſcretion ſhould forfeit for my child, it even woundeth me deep to the very ſoul.</p>
               <p>You will pardon my infirmity, ſomething I ſhould have ſaid, but I am not able, (and ſighed) therefore let it paſſe.</p>
               <p>And now my Lords, I have been, by the bleſſing of Almighty God, taught, that the afflictions of this life preſent, are not to be compared to the eternal weight of that glory that ſhall be revealed to us hereafter.</p>
               <p>And ſo my Lords, even ſo with tranquility of mind, I do ſubmit my ſelf freely and clearly to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips judgments; and whether that righteous judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall be to life or death.</p>
               <q>Te Deum laudamus, te Dominum conſitemur.</q>

                  <salute>My L. Primate of Ireland!</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>IT is my very great comfort that I have your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip by me this day, in regard I have been known to you this many years, and I doe thank God and your Lordſhip for it that you are here, I ſhould be very glad to obtain ſo much ſilence as to be heard a few words, but I doubt I ſhall not the noiſe is ſo great. My Lords, I am come hither by the good will and pleaſure of Almighty God, to pay that laſt debt I owe to ſin, which is death, and by the bleſſing of that God, to riſe again through the merits of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to righteouſneſſe and life eternal. [Here he was a little interrupted.]</p>
               <p>My Lords, I am come hither to ſubmit to that Judgement which hath paſſed againſt me, I do it with a very quiet and contented mind, I thank God I doe freely forgive all the world, a forgiveneſſe, that is not ſpoken from the teeth outwards (as they ſay) but from the very heart, I ſpeak it in the preſence of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, before whom I ſtand, that there is not a diſpleaſing thought ariſing in me towards any man living. I thank God I can ſay it, and truly too, my conſcience bearing me witneſs, that in all my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment ſince I had the Honour to ſerve his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, I never had any thing in the purpoſe of my heart but what tended to the joynt and Individuall proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of King and people; although it hath been my ill fortune to be miſconſtrued.</p>
               <p>I am not the firſt that hath ſuffered in this kind, it is the common portion of us all, while we are in this life to erre, Righteous Judgement we muſt
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:51765:47"/>
wait for in another place, for here we are very ſubject to be miſ-judged one of another; There is one thing that I deſire to free my ſelf of, and I am very confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent (ſpeaking it now with ſo much chearfulneſſe) that I ſhall obtain your Chriſtian charity in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of it. I was ſo far from being againſt Parliaments, that I did alwaies think the Parliaments of England were the moſt happy conſtitutions that any Kingdom or Nation lived under, and the beſt means under God to make the King and people happy.</p>
               <p>For my Death I here acquit all the world, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech the God of Heaven heartily to forgive them that contrived it, though in the intentions and purpoſes of my heart I am not guilty of what I dye for; And my Lord Primate, it is a great comfort for me, that his Majeſty conceives me not meriting ſo ſevere and heavy a puniſhment as is the utmoſt execution of this Sentence. I do infinitely rejoyce in this mercy of his, and I beſeech God return it into his own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, that he may find mercy when he ſtands moſt in need of it.</p>
               <p>I wiſh this Kingdom all the Proſperity and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the world, I did it living, and now dying it is my wiſh, I do moſt humbly recommend this to every one who hears me, and deſire they would lay their hands upon their hearts, and conſider ſeriouſly whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the beginning of the happineſſe and reformation of a Kingdom ſhould be written in Letters of bloud: conſider this when you are at your homes, and let me be never ſo unhappy, as that the laſt drop of my bloud ſhould riſe up in Judgement againſt any one of you, but I fear you are in a wrong way.</p>
               <p>My Lords, I have but one word more, and with that I ſhall end. I profeſſe that I die a true and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient Son to the Church of England, wherein I was
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:51765:47"/>
born and in which I was bred. Peace and proſperity be ever to it.</p>
               <p>It hath been objected (if it were an objection worth the anſwering) that I have been inclined to Popery, but I ſay truly from my heart, that from the time that I was one and twenty years of age to this preſent, going now upon forty nine; I never had in my heart to doubt of this religion of the Church of England; Nor ever had any man the boldneſſe to ſuggeſt any ſuch thing to me, to the beſt of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance: and ſo being reconciled by the merits of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> my <hi>Saviour,</hi> into whoſe boſome I hope I ſhall ſhortly be gathered, to thoſe eternall happineſſes which ſhall never have end; I deſire heartily the forgiveneſſe of every man, for any raſh or unadviſed words, or any thing done amiſſe; and ſo my Lords and Gentlemen Farewell; Farewell all the things of this world.</p>
               <p>I deſire that you would be ſilent and joyn with me in prayer, and I truſt in God we ſhall all meet and live eternally in heaven, there to receive the Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of all happineſſe, where every teare ſhall be wiped away from our eyes, and every ſad thought from our hearts; and ſo God bleſſe this Kingdom, and Jeſus have mercy on my Soul.</p>
               <p>Then turning himſelf about, he ſaluted all the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men; and took a ſolemn leave of all conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perſons upon the Scaffold, giving them his hand.</p>
               <p>After that he ſaid, Gentlemen, I would ſay my prayers, and intreat you all to pray with me, and for me; then his Chaplain laid the book of Common-prayer upon the Chaire before him, as he kneeled down, on which he prayed almoſt a quarter of an hour, and then as long or longer without the Book, and concluded with the Lords prayer.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:51765:48"/>Standing up he eſpies his Brother, Sir <hi>Gorge Went<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth,</hi> and calls him to him ſaying, Brother, we muſt part, remember me to my Siſter, and to my wife, and carry my bleſſing to my Son, and charge him that he fear God, and continue an obedient Son to the Church of England, and warne him that he bears no private grudge or revenge toward any man concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me; And bid him beware that he meddle not with Church-livings, for that will prove a moth and canker to him in his eſtate, and wiſh him to content himſelf to be a Servant to his Country, not aiming at higher Preferments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aliter</hi>] To his Son Maſtet <hi>Wentworth</hi> he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends himſelf, and gives him charge to ſerve his God, to ſubmit to his King with all faith and Allegiance in things temporal, to the Church in things Spiritual, chargeth him again and again, as he will anſwer it to him in heaven, never to meddle with the Patrimony of the Church, for if he did, it would be a Canker to eat up the reſt of his Eſtate.</p>
               <p>Carry my bleſſing alſo to my daughter <hi>Anno,</hi> and <hi>Arabella,</hi> charge them to ſerve and fear God, and he will bleſſe them; not forgetting my little Infant, who yet knows neither good nor evil, and cannot ſpeak for it ſelf, God ſpeak for it, and bleſſe it; now ſaid he, I have nigh done, one Stroke will make my wife hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandleſs, my dear children fatherleſſe, and my poor Servants Maſterleſſe, and will ſeparate me from my dear Brother, and all my friends. But let God be to you and them all in all.</p>
               <p>After this, going to take off his doublet and to make himſelf unready, he ſaid, I thank God I am not affraid of Death, nor daunted with any diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment riſing from any fears, but do as chearfully put off my doublet at this time, as ever I did when I
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:51765:48"/>
went to bed; then he put off his doublet, wound up his hair with his hands, and put on a white Cap.</p>
               <p>Then he called, where is the man that is to do this laſt office? (meaning the executioner) call him to me; when he came and asked him forgiveneſs, he told him he forgave him and all the world: then kneeling down by the block, he went to prayer again himſelf, the Primate of Ireland kneeling on the one ſide, and the Miniſter on the other: To the which Miniſter, after prayer, he turned himſelf, having done prayer, and ſpake ſome few words ſoftly, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his hands lifted up, and cloſed with the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters hands.</p>
               <p>Then bowing himſelf to lay his head upon the block, he told the executioner that he would firſt lay down his head to try the fitneſs of the block, and take it up again before he would lay it down for good and all: And ſo he did; and before he layed it down again, he told the Executioner that he would give him warning when to ſtrike by ſtretching forth his hands; And preſently laying down his neck upon the block, and ſtretching forth his hands, the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner ſtrook off his head at one blow, and taking it up in his hand ſhewed it to all the people, and ſaid, <hi>God ſave the King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His body was afterwards embalmed, and appointed to be carried into York-ſhire, there to be buried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his Anceſtors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He left theſe three Inſtructions for his Sonne in writing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, That he ſhould continue ſtill to be brought up under thoſe Governors to whom he had committed him; As being the beſt he could pick out of all thoſe within his knowledg, and that he ſhould not change them, unleſſe they were weary of him; that he ſhould
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:51765:49"/>
rather want himſelf, then they ſhould want any thing they could deſire.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He chargeth him as he would anſwer it at the laſt day, not to put himſelf upon any publique employments till he was thirty years of age at leaſt: And then if his Prince ſhould call him to Publique Service, he ſhould carefully undertake it, to teſtify his obedience, and withall to be faithfull and ſincere to his Maſter, though he ſhould come to the ſame end that himſelf did.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that he ſhould never lay any hand upon any thing that belonged to the Church; He foreſaw that ruine was like to come upon the Revenues of the Church, and that perhaps they might be ſhared amongſt the Nobility, and Gentry: But if his Son medled with any of it, he wiſhed the curſe of God might follow him, and all them, to the deſtruction <hi>of the moſt Apoſtolicall Church upon Earth.</hi>

               <p>IT hath pleaſed God to bring me to this place, God hath how returned my prayer upon me, my prayer was, that if this Deſign might not be Honorable to him, that it might be known. God hath heard me and it is diſcovered, that ſame very thing hath ſatisfied me, that I was in an errour; and that I am confident, I was in a great deal of fault; And I confeſſe I doe now die juſtly; and I pray God, that I may now glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie the Lord.</p>
               <p>I ſhall onely thus much declare to the world, that they may take off the aſperſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>on that was laid upon
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:51765:51"/>
my partner, and my wife, which neither of them did know of this Deſign: I have declared my conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence freely to God and the world in every particular that concerns the buſineſs; thus much I ſhall ſay for my own particular. There were three things laid to my charge which there was ſome miſtake in; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Kings Letter, whereas it was thought to be another way, I thank God, it was not that way. Then concerning the Seal, I had no hand in the procuring of it, nor knew not of it till the Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.</p>
               <p>There is another thing that is concerning the ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Magazines, which I had no hand in neither. But I die juſtly, and I deſerve this puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>But now to you all that are here, let my example be to you, that you never take your ſelf to any thing but what you have warrant for from the Lord; I had no warrant I vow to God, that hath now ſatisfied me, that the Lord I hope will forgive me, I have heartily repented, and I beſeech you all to take this as a warning.</p>
               <p>And whereas there is now a great deal of diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and diviſion in the City; and that we now make difference, between Gods Miniſters, and Gods Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters deſpiſe no meanes, I acknowledge my fault; I did make ſome difference, and I now acknowledg it; and deſire the Lord to forgive me, I have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved more comfort from ſuch men, then ever I had before.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not now have much to ſay, But I deſire heartily that the whole world would forgive me, I do beg of my God, and of my Chriſt (who I have not honoured ſo much as I ſhould have done) that he would have mercy upon me.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:51765:51"/>And now to you all I ſpeak, I do now as freely forgive you, as I truſt my Saviour Jeſus Chriſt hath forgiven me. And ſo Lord Jeſus, into thy hands do I commend my ſpirit, for thou haſt redeemed me O Lord God; and ſo the Lord take me, and the Lord receive me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then his Father tendred him the Kings pardon, Saying.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here is the Kings gracious pardon.</p>
               <p>To which Mr. <hi>Challener</hi> replyed,</p>
               <p>Sir, I beſeech you trouble me not with it.</p>
               <p>Pray ſpeak to my friends to take care of my corps, and carry me home.</p>
               <p>Whereupon Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> ſaid to him, You are now before the Lord of Heaven, if you have any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Lords, you ſpoke of ſo often laſt night, I beſeech you ſpeak your Conſcience.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Challenor</hi> anſwering thus, Gentlemen, It is the happieſt day that ever I had;</p>
               <p>I ſhall now (Gentlemen) declare a little more of the occaſion of this, as I am deſired by Mr. <hi>Peters,</hi> and to give him, and the world ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>It came from Mr. <hi>Waller</hi> under this notion, that if that we could make a moderate party here in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> to ſtand betwixt the gap, and in the gap, to u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite the King and the Parliament, it would be a very acceptable work, for now the three Kingdoms lay a bleeding, and unleſſe that were done, there was no hopes to unite them; withall I made this Reply. Sir, if I could aſſure you of three parts of <hi>London,</hi> none of them ſhould ſtir, unleſs we had the countenance of the Lords and Commons; To this he replyed, You ſhall have to countenance this buſineſs the whole Houſe of Lords except three or four; you ſhall have
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:51765:52"/>
divers of the Houſe of Commons, we were promiſed we ſhould ſpeak with theſe Lords; And in truth except we had ſpoken with theſe Lords, nothing could have been done; for Mr. <hi>Abbot,</hi> Mr. <hi>Blinke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horne,</hi> Mr. <hi>Luntloe,</hi> Mr. <hi>King,</hi> and my ſelf agreed that we would not ſtir, til theſe Lords had declared themſelves and would be ingaged.</p>
               <p>And now (Gentlemen) I have another thing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, which ſhall be in the behalf of thoſe that are condemned; As Mr. <hi>Waller</hi> was the mouth from the Lords, as he did declare, ſo I was the unhappy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, from Mr. <hi>Waller</hi> to the reſt; the ſentence is now paſt, I deſire if it might be, that it might be moved to the Houſe, that no more might ſuffer in the cauſe. This is all I have to ſay, and deſire your hearty prayers to God for me.</p>
               <p>Then one Mr. <hi>Smart</hi> ſaid unto him, Mr. <hi>Challenor,</hi> if you were to live longer, would you ever have done the like again?</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Challenor</hi> Anſwered, I am thus far confident, that if it had pleaſed God to lend me life, I think I ſhould have run another courſe, and I am confident of it; I hope this is the happieſt day I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw, and I hope God is reconciled to me, in my Saviour Jeſus Chriſt; that hath given me repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and I am confident he will return my prayer for me.</p>
               <p>Then at his requeſt Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> prayed very fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently and devoutly with him: after his prayer was ended, Mr. <hi>Challenor</hi> ſpake theſe words.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I do from my heart forgive you and all the world, deſiring you and all the world <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>ON Tueſday, <hi>Novemb. 19. 1644.</hi> By the Court then ſitting in <hi>Guild-hall London,</hi> (Sir <hi>John Corbet</hi> being Preſident of the Court) Sir <hi>Alexander Carew</hi> Baronet was tryed. The effect of the Charge against him was, that he the ſaid <hi>Alexander Carew</hi> being Governour of the Iſland of <hi>St. Nicolas</hi> near <hi>Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> and of the Forces therein for the Parliament, did hold correspondency with the Enemy, both by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Treaties and by Letters, and endeaveured the yeilding of that Iſland and Fort to the Enemy, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by divers of his Letters to Colonel <hi>Edgcombe,</hi> and Major <hi>Scowen,</hi> of the Enemies party, which Charge was grounded upon the <hi>2.</hi> and <hi>7.</hi> Articles in the Ordinances of Parliament for Martial Law. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that whereas Sir <hi>George Chidleigh</hi> was pitcht upon as Governour for that Iſland, and for that purpoſe he had a Commiſſion from the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation from him by conſent of Parliament, the Charge and government thereof was intruſted upon Sir <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Carew,</hi> but by the ſaid <hi>Alexander Carew,</hi> as is just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved by divers Witneſſes the deſigne was plotted &amp; contrived. After his heart was poſſeſſed with theſe Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with the Enemy, it ſoon vented it ſelf into outward expreſſion: Firſt, by openly declaring his reſolution to hold this Iſland for the <hi>King;</hi> &amp; then by indeavouring to put that reſolution in practice. Many other circumſtances were alleaged againſt him to this purpoſe, and made good against him by divers Witneſſes: viz. <hi>Mr. Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>

All which by their ſeveral Depoſitions did clearly prove his ſaid deſign to betray the Iſland to the Enemy: Many of which actions as aforeſaid, though clearly proved and teſtified upon oath, the ſaid Sir <hi>Alex. Carew</hi> denied, and pleaded that the Ordinance of Parliament did look forward, and not backward, and that he ought not to be tryed by them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Unto which Mr.</hi> Mills <hi>Advocate of the Court, replied:</hi>

                  <hi>1.</hi> That your defence was grounded upon the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Parliament, which they hold not onely inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, but to reflect upon the wiſdome and juſtice of the Parliament.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> That the exception grew upon a great miſtake: for the two Articles which they proceeded againſt you, is upon the ſecond and ſeventh Articles, which are very clear againſt you, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſecond and ſeventh, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall plot,</hi> &amp;c.

For the <hi>Proviſo</hi> in the Ordinance, it is plain in it ſelf.</p>

that it ſhall be better for me, being aſſured thereby to be freed from the miſeries of ſin, and enter into a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter life.

his eſtate hath been very large, he hath been a man of 3000l. a year, and he had much money by him: in the beginning of his daies he was a Souldier in the Low-Countries, at the battel at </hi>Prague: <hi>he does profeſs, that in the places he lived in (in the North part of</hi> England<hi>) there was much ignorance through want of faithfull Preachers; And I do wonder at it, ſince the Reprieve came, I have found the mercy of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to him more, every day then other, eſpecially by means of the Miniſters whoſe boſomes God hath opened towards him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pray, be pleaſed to take notice of his deſire, that you ſhould ſee by him the vanity of wit, parts, proweſſe, strength or honour, or any thing that comes by men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>After this he ſaid, Sir</hi> John Hotham <hi>deſired him to let him know, that upon his firſt going out a Souldier, his Father ſeeing him on Horſe-back, spake to him thus.</hi>

                  <hi>Good People!</hi> This is a very uncomfortable time to preach in, and yet I ſhall begin with a Text of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, in the twelfth of the <hi>Hebrewes.</hi>

               <q>Let us run with patience that race that is ſet before us, looking unto Jeſus the author and finiſher of our faith, who for the joy that was ſet before him, endured the Croſſe, deſpiſing the ſhame, and is ſet down at the right hand of the Throne of God.</q>
               <p>I have been long in my race, <note n="*" place="margin">An. Aet. <hi>72.</hi>
                  </note> and how I have looked unto Jeſus the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:51765:56"/>
and finiſher of my faith, is beſt known to him. I am now come to the end of my race, and here I find the Croſſe, a death of ſhame, but the ſhame muſt be deſpiſed, or there is no coming to the right hand of God; Jeſus deſpis'd the ſhame for me, and God forbid but I ſhould deſpiſe the ſhame for him. I am going apace, as you ſee, towards the Red-ſea, and my feet are upon the very brinks of it, an argument, I hope, that that God is bringing me to the Land of Promiſe, for that was the way by which of old he led his people; But before they came to the Sea, he inſtituted a paſſe-over for them, a Lamb it was, but it was to be eaten with very ſowre Herbs, as in the Twelfth of <hi>Exodus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall obey, and labour to digeſt the ſowre Herbs, as well as the Lamb, and I ſhall remember that it is the Lords Paſſeover; I ſhall not think of the Herbs, nor be angry with the hands that gathered them, but look up onely to him who inſtituted the one, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneth the other: For men can have no more power over me, then that which is given them from above; I am not in love with this paſſage through the red-Sea, for I have the weakneſſe and infirmity of fleſh and bloud in me, and I have prayed as my Saviour taught me, and exampled me, <hi>Ut tranſiret ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix iſte,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That this Cup of red Wine might paſſe away from me; but ſince it is not that my will may, his will be done; and I ſhall moſt willingly drink of this Cup as deep as he pleaſes, and enter into this Sea, and paſſe through it, in the way that he will be pleaſed to lead me.</p>
               <p>And yet (Good People) it would be remembred, That when the Servants of God, old <hi>Iſrael,</hi> were in this boiſterous Sea, and <hi>Aaron</hi> with them, the Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:51765:57"/>
which perſecuted them, and did in a manner drive them into that Sea, were drowned in the ſame waters, while they were in purſuit of them: I know my God whom I ſerve, is as able to deliver me from this Sea of Bloud, as he was to deliver three Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren from the furnace, as <hi>Daniel</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>And I moſt humbly thank my Saviour for it, my Reſolution is now, as theirs was then; their Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution was, They would not worſhip the Image the KING had ſet up, nor ſhall I the Imaginations which the PEOPLE are ſetting up, nor will I forſake the Temple, and the truth of GOD, to follow the Bleating of <hi>Jeroboams</hi> Calves in <hi>Dan</hi> and in <hi>Bethel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And I pray God bleſſe all this People, and open their eyes, that they may ſee the right way; for if it fall out that the blind lead the blind, doubtleſſe they will both into the ditch: For my ſelf, I am, (and I acknowledged it in all humility) a moſt grievous ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner many waies, by thought, word and deed, and therefore I cannot doubt but that GOD hath mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in ſtore for me a poor penitent, as well as for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſinners. I have, upon this ſad occaſion, ranſack'd every corner of my heart, and yet I thank God, I have not found any of my ſins that are there, any ſins now deſerving death by any known Law of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and yet thereby I charge nothing upon my Judges (I humbly beſeech you I may rightly be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, I charge nothing in the leaſt degree upon my Judges) for they are to proceed by proof, by valuable Witneſſes, and in that way I or any Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent in the world may juſtly be condemned: And I thank God, though the weight of the Sentence lye very heavy upon me, yet I am as quiet within, as (I thank Chriſt for it) I ever was in my life: and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:51765:57"/>
though I am not the firſt Archbiſhop, but the firſt man that ever dyed by an Ordinance of Parliament, yet ſome of my Predeceſſors have gone this way, though not by this means: for <hi>Elfegus</hi> was hurried away and loſt his head by the <hi>Danes,</hi> and <hi>Simon Sudbury</hi> in the fury of <hi>Wat Tyler</hi> and his fellowes: And long before theſe Saint <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> had his head danced off by a lewd Woman, and Saint <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Carthage</hi> ſubmitted his head to a perſecuting ſword. Many examples great and good, for they teach me patience, and I hope my cauſe in Heaven will look of another dye then the colour that is put upon it here upon earth; and ſome comfort it is to me, not only that I go the way of theſe great men in their ſeveral Generations, but alſo that my charge (if I may not be partiall) looks ſomewhat like that againſt Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the 25. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> for he was accuſed for the Law and the Temple, that is the Law and Religion; and like that of St. <hi>Stephen</hi> in the ſixth of the <hi>Acts,</hi> for breaking the Ordinances which <hi>Moſes</hi> gave us, which Ordinances were Law and Religion: but you'l ſay, do I then compare my ſelf with the integrity of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and Saint <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen?</hi> no, God forbid, far be it from me; I onely raiſe a comfort to my ſelf, that theſe great Saints and ſervants of God were thus laid up in their ſeverall times; And it is very memorable that Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who was one of them, and a great one, that helped on the accuſation againſt Saint <hi>Stephen,</hi> fell after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards into the ſelf-ſame accuſation himſelf, yet both of them great Saints and ſervants of God; I but perhaps a great clamour there is, that I would have brought in Popery. I ſhall anſwer that more fully by and by, in the mean time, you know what the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees</hi> ſaid againſt Chriſt himſelf, in the eleventh of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:51765:58"/>
                  <hi>John, If we let him alone all men will believe him,</hi> Et veniunt Romani, <hi>and the Romanes will come and take away both our place and the Nation.</hi> Here was a cauſeleſſe cry againſt Chriſt that Romans would come, and ſee how juſt the Judgement of God was, they crucified Chriſt for fear leſt the Romanes ſhould come, his death was that that brought in the Romanes upon them, God puniſhing them with that which they moſt feared: and I pray God this clamour of <hi>veniunt Romani,</hi> (of which I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to my knowledg no juſt cauſe) help not to bring him in; for the Pope never had ſuch an har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt in England ſince the Reformation, as he hath now upon the Sects and diviſions that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us; in the mean time, <hi>by honour and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, by good report and evil report, as a deceiver and yet true,</hi> am I now paſſing out of this world. Some particulars alſo I think not amiſſe to ſpeak of.</p>
               <p>Firſt, this I ſhall be bold to ſpeak of the King, our gracious Soveraign, he hath been much tradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by ſome for labouring to bring in Popery, but upon my Conſcience (of which I am now going to give God a preſent account) I know him to be as free from this Charge I think as any man living, and I hold him to be as ſound a Proteſtant, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Religion by Law eſtabliſhed as any man in this Kingdom, and that he will venture his Life as far and as freely for it; and I think I do, or ſhould know both his affection to Religion, and his grounds upon which that affection is built, as fully as any man in England.</p>
               <p>The ſecond particular is concerning this great and populous City, which God bleſſe; here hath been of late a faſhion taken up to gather hands, and then goe
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:51765:58"/>
to the Honourable and great Court of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, the Parliament, and clamour for Juſtice, as if that great and wiſe Court, (before whom the cauſes come which are unknown to the many;) could not, or would not doe Juſtice, but at their call and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment; a way which may endanger many an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent man, and pluck innocent bloud upon their own heads, and perhaps upon this City alſo, which God forbid: and this hath been lately practis'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my ſelf; God forgive the ſetters of this, with all my heart I begge it, but many well-meaning peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are caught by it: In Saint <hi>Stevens</hi> caſe, when nothing elſe would ſerve, they ſtirred up the people againſt him, <hi>Acts</hi> 6. and <hi>Herod</hi> went juſt the ſelf ſame way, for when he had kill'd Saint <hi>James,</hi> he would not venture upon Saint <hi>Peter</hi> too, till he ſaw how the people took it, and were pleaſed with it, in the 12. of the <hi>Acts.</hi> But take heed of having your hands full of bloud, in the firſt of <hi>Iſaiah</hi>; for there is a time beſt known to himſelf, when God among other ſinnes makes inquiſition for bloud; and when Inquiſition is on foot, the Pſalmiſt tells us, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 9. that God remembers, that is not all, <hi>that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members and forgets not</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of the poor</hi>; and he tells you what poor they are in the ninth verſe, the poor whoſe bloud is ſhed by ſuch kind of meanes: Take heed of this, <hi>It is a fearfull thing</hi> (at any time) <hi>to fall into the hands of the living God,</hi> in the 12. of the <hi>Hebrews:</hi> but it is fearfull indeed, &amp; then eſpecially, when he is making his Inquiſition for bloud, and therefore with my prayers to avert the Propheſie from the City, let me deſire that this City would remember the Propheſie that is expreſſed, <hi>Jeremiah</hi> 26.15.</p>
               <p>The third particular, is this poor Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:51765:59"/>
that hath flouriſhed and been a ſhelter to other neighbouring Churches, when ſtormes have driven upon them; but alas, now it is in a ſtorme it ſelf, and God knows whether or how it ſhall get out; and which is worſe them a ſtorme from without, it is become like an Oake cleft to ſhivers with wedges made out of its own body, and that in every cleft, prophaneſſe and irreligion is creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in apace; while as <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 2. de vitae Contemp. Cap. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Prosper</hi> ſaith, men that introduce prophaneſs are cloaked with a name of imaginary religion: for we have in a manner almoſt loſt the ſubſtance, and dwell much, nay too much a great deal in Opinion; and that Church which all the Jeſuites machinations in theſe parts of Chriſtendome could not ruine, is now fallen into a great deal of danger by her own.</p>
               <p>The laſt particular (for I am not willing to be tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, I ſhall haſten to goe out of this miſerable world) is my ſelf, and I beſeech you, as many as are within hearing, obſerve me, I was born and baptized in the boſome of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as it ſtands yet eſtabliſhed by Law, in that profeſſion I have ever ſince lived, and in that profeſſion of the Proteſtant Religion here eſtabliſhed I come now to die; this is no time to diſſemble with God, leaſt of all in matter of Religion, and therefore I deſire it may be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, I have always lived in the Proteſtant Religion eſtabliſhed in <hi>England,</hi> and in that I come now to die: What Clamors and Slanders I have endured for labouring to keep an Uniformity in the external ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God according to the Doctrine and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice of this Church all men know, and I have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly felt: Now at laſt I am accuſed of high Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in Parliament, a crime which my ſoul ever abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, this Treaſon was charged upon me to conſiſt of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:51765:59"/>
two parts, An endeavour to ſubvert the Law of the Realm, and a like endeavour to overthrow the true. Proteſtant Religion eſtabliſhed by thoſe Laws. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides my Anſwers which I gave to the ſeverall Charges, I proteſted my innocency in both Houſes; it was ſaid, Priſoners proteſtations at the Barre muſt not be taken <hi>de ipſo</hi>; I can bring no witneſſe of my heart, and the intentions thereof, therefore I muſt come to my Proteſtation, not at the bar, but to my Proteſtation at this hour and inſtant of my death, in which (as I ſaid before) I hope all men will be ſuch charitable Chriſtians as not to think I would die and diſſemble my Religion, I doe therefore here, with that caution that I delivered before, without all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice in the world to my Judges, that are to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed <hi>ſecundum allegata &amp; probata,</hi> and ſo to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, I die in the preſence of Almighty God and all his holy and bleſſed Angels, and I take it now on my death, that I never endeavoured the ſubverſion of the Laws of the Realm, nor never any change of the Proteſtant Religion into Popiſh ſuperſtition: and I deſire you all to remember this Proteſt of mine, for my innocency in theſe and from all manner of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whatſoever.</p>
               <p>I have been accuſed likewiſe as an enemy to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, no, God forbid, I underſtood them, and the benefits that come by them, a great deal too well to be ſo, but I did indeed diſlike ſome miſgovern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (as I conceived) of ſome few, one or two Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments; and I did conceive humbly that I might have reaſon for it, for <hi>corruptio optimi eſt peſſima:</hi> There is no corruption in the world ſo bad as that which is of the beſt thing in it ſelf, for the better the thing is in nature, the worſe it is corrupted; and this being the higheſt and greateſt Court, over which no
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:51765:60"/>
other can have any juriſdiction in the Kingdome, if by any way a miſ-government (which God forbid) ſhould any ways fall upon it, the Subjects of this Kingdome are left without all manner of remedy, and therefore God preſerve them, and bleſs them, and direct them, that there may be no miſ-conceit, much leſſe miſ-government amongſt them. I will not inlarge my ſelf any further, I have done, I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give all the world, all and every of thoſe bitter ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, or others whoſoever they have been, which have any wayes proſecuted me in this kind, and I humbly deſire to be forgiven firſt of God, and then of every man, whether I have offended him or no, if he doe but conceive that I have; Lord, doe thou forgive me, and I beg forgiveneſſe of him, and ſo I heartily deſire you to joyn with me in prayer.</p>

                  <p>O <hi>Eternall God and mercifull Father, look down upon me in mercy, in the riches and fulneſſe of all thy mercies look upon me, but not till thou haſt nailed my ſins to the Croſs of Chriſt; look upon me, but not till thou haſt bathed me in the blood of Chriſt, not till I have hid my ſelf in the wounds of Chriſt, that ſo the puniſhment that is due to my ſinnes may paſſe away and goe over me; and ſince thou art pleaſed to try me to the uttermoſt, I humbly beſeech thee give me now in this great inſtant full patience, proportionable comfort, a heart ready to die for thine honour, the Kings happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and the Churches preſervation: and my zeal to theſe (farre from arrogancy be it spoken) is all the ſin, (humane frailty excepted, and all incidents thereunto)

                  <p>It will not lengthen the time much if you ſtay while you have a return from him. My Lord, you ſhould do well to beſtow your time now in meditating upon, and imploring of the free mercy of God in Chriſt for your eternal Salvation, and look upon that ever-ſtreaming Fountain of his precious Bloud, that purgeth us from all our ſins, even the ſins of the deepeſt dye: the Bloud of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt waſhes away all our ſins, and that Bloud of Chriſt is powred forth upon all ſuch as by a lively Faith lay hold upon him: God ſo loved the World that he gave his only begotten Son, to the end, that whoſoever believed in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life; that is now, my Lord, the Rock upon which you muſt chiefly reſt, and labour to fix your ſelf in the free mercy of God through Chriſt Jeſus, whoſe mercies are from everlaſting to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, unto all ſuch as with the eye of Faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him; behold Jeſus the Author and Finiſher of your Salvation, who hath ſatisfied the Juſtice of God by that All-ſufficiency of his Sacrifice, which
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:51765:63"/>
once for all he offered upon the Croſs for the ſins of the whole world, ſo that the ſting of death is taken away from all Believers, and he hath ſanctified it as a paſſage to everlaſting bleſſedneſs: It is true, the waters of <hi>Jordan</hi> run ſomewhat rough and ſurly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Wilderneſs and our paſſage into <hi>Canaan,</hi> but let us reſt upon the Ark (my Lord) the Ark Chriſt Jeſus, that will carry us through, and above all thoſe waves to that Rock of ages, which no flood nor waves can reach unto, and to him who is yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, to day, and the ſame for ever, againſt whom the powers and principalities, the gates of Hell, ſhall never be able to prevail; lift up and faſten your eyes now upon Chriſt crucified; and labour to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Jeſus ſtand at the right hand of his Father, (as the Protomartyr <hi>Stephen</hi>) ready to receive your ſoul, when it ſhall be ſeparated from this frail and mortal body: Alas, no man would deſire life, if he knew beforehand what it were to live, it is nothing but ſorrow, vexation and trouble, grief and diſcontent that waits upon every condition, whether publick or private; in every ſtation and calling there are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral miſeries and troubles that are inſeparable from them; therefore what a bleſſed thing it is to have a ſpeedy and comfortable paſſage out of this raging Sea, into the Port of everlaſting Happineſs; We muſt paſſe through a Sea, but it is the Sea of Chriſts Bloud, in which never ſoul ſuffered ſhipwrack, in which we muſt be blown with winds and tempeſts, but they are the Gales of Gods Spirit upon us, which blow away all contrary winds of diffidence in his mercy.</p>

               <p>His Lordſhips ſervant being returned, and having delivered his meſſage to the Earl of <hi>Cambridg</hi> privately, he ſaid; So, it is done now: and then turning to the front of the Scaffold, before which (as in all the reſt of the Palaces) there was a great concourſe of people, he ſaid;</p>

                  <speaker>Cambridg.</speaker>
                  <p>I think it is truly not very neceſſary for me to ſpeak much, there are many Gentlemen and Souldiers there that ſees me, but my voyce truly is ſo weak, ſo low that they cannot hear me, neither truly was I ever at any time ſo much in love with ſpeaking, or with any thing I had to expreſs, that I took delight in it; yet this being the laſt time that I am to do ſo, by a divine Providence of Almighty God, who hath brought me to this end juſtly for my ſins; I ſhall to you Sir, Mr. Sheriff, declare thus much, as to the matter that I am now to ſuffer for which is as being a Traytor to the Kingdom of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>: Truly, Sir, it was a Country that I equally lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with my own, I made no difference; I never intended either the generality of its prejudice, or any particular mans in it; what I did was by the Command of the Parliament of the Country where I was born, whoſe Commands I could not diſobey, without running into the ſame hazard there of that condition that I am now in: The ends, Sir, of that

                  <p>(But to that which I was ſaying Sir.) It pleaſed God ſo to diſpoſe that Army under my Command, as it was ruined; and I, as their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, clothed with a Commiſſion, ſtand here now ready to dye; I ſhall not trouble you with repeating of my Plea, what I ſaid in my own Defence at the Court of <hi>JUSTICE,</hi> my ſelf being ſatisfied with the commands that is laid upon me, and they ſatisfied with the Juſtneſſe of their procedure; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Laws of this Land. God is juſt, and howſoever I ſhall not ſay any thing as to the matter of the ſentence, but that I do willingly ſubmit to his Divine Providence, and I acknowledg that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many ways I deſerve even a worldly puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as well as hereafter; for we are all ſinful, Sir, and I a great one: yet for my comfort, I know there is a God in heaven that is exceeding merciful; I know my Redeemer ſits at his Right Hand, and am confident, (clapping his hand to his Breaſt) is Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diating for me at this inſtant; I am hopeful through his free grace, and all-ſufficient merits, to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned of my ſins, and to be received into his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; upon that I rely, truſting to nothing but the Free Grace of God through Jeſus Chriſt: I have not been tainted with my Religion, I thank God for it, ſince my infancy, it hath been ſuch as hath been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in the Land, and eſtabliſhed; and now 'tis not this Religion, or that Religion, or this or that Fancy
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:51765:65"/>
of men that is to be built upon; 'tis but one that's right, one that's ſure, and that comes from God. Sir, and in the free grace of our Saviour. Sir, there is truly ſomething that (<note n="*" place="margin">Obſerving the Writers.</note> had I thought my Speech would have been thus taken) I would have digeſted it into ſome bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter method then now I can, and ſhall deſire theſe Gentlemen that do write it, that they will not wrong me in it, and that it may not in this manner be publiſhed to my diſadvantage, for truly I did not intend to have ſpoken thus when I came here.</p>
                  <p>There is, ſirs, terrible aſperſions has been laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my ſelf; truly ſuch as I thank God, I am very free from; as if my actions and intentions had not been ſuch as they were pretended for; but that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding what I pretended it was for the King, there was nothing leſs intended then to ſerve him in it. I was bred with him for many years, I was his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick ſervant, and there was nothing declar'd by the Parliament, that was not really intended by me; and truly in it I ventured my life one way, and now I loſe it another way; and that was one of the ends, as to the King; I ſpeak onely of that; becauſe the reſt has many particulars, and to clear my ſelf from ſo horrid an aſperſion as is laid upon me: neither was there any other deſign known to me by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming of the Army, then what is really in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration publiſhed. His perſon, I do profeſs, I had reaſon to love, as he was my King, and as he had been my maſter: it has pleaſed God now to diſpoſe of him, ſo as it cannot be thought flattery to have ſaid this; or any end in me for the ſaying of it, but to free my ſelf from that calumny which lay upon me: I cannot gain by it; yet Truth is that which we ſhall gain by for ever.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="91" facs="tcp:51765:65"/>There hath been much ſpoken Sir, of an invitation into this Kingdom: it's mentioned in that <hi>Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>; and truly to that I did and do remit my ſelf: and I have been very much laboured for diſcoveries of theſe Inviters. 'Tis no time to diſſemble. How willingly I was to have ſerved this Nation in any thing that was in my power, is known to very many honeſt, pious, and religious men; and how ready I would have been to have done what I could to have ſerved them, if it had pleaſed them to have preſerved my life, in whoſe hands there was a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: They have not thought it fit, and ſo I am become unuſeful in that which willingly I would have done. As I ſaid at firſt, (Sir) ſo I ſay now concerning that point; I wiſh the Kingdoms happineſs, I wiſh it peace; and truly Sir, I wiſh that this bloud of mine may be the laſt that is drawn; and howſoever I may perhaps have ſome reluctancy with my ſelf, as to the matter of my fact, for my ſuffering, for my fact, yet I freely forgive all; Sir, I carry no rancour along with me to my grave; His Will be done that has created both Heaven and Earth, and me a poor mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable ſinful creature now ſpeaking before him. For me to ſpeak (Sir) to you State-buſineſs, and the Government of the Kingdom, or my opinion in that, or for any thing in that nature, truly it is to no end, it contributes nothing; My own inclination hath been to peace, from the beginning; and it is known to many that I never was an ill inſtrument betwixt the King and his people; I never acted to the prejudice of the Parliament; I bore no Arms, I medled not with it; I was not wanting by my prayers to God Almighty for the happineſs of the King; and truly I ſhall pray ſtill, that God may ſo direct him, as that may be done which ſhall tend

Mercy, and the Merits of Jeſus Chriſt, who ſits upon the Throne; I come flying from that of Juſtice, to that of Mercy and Tenderneſs, for his Sake which ſhed his blood for ſinners, that he would take Compaſſion upon me, that he will look upon we as one that gracious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hears me, that he would look upon me as one that hath Redeemed me; that he would look upon me as one that hath ſhed his blood for me; that he would look upon me as one who now calls and hopes to be ſaved by his All-ſufficient merits. For his ſake (Glorious God) have Compaſſion upon me in the Freeneſs of thy infinite Mercy, that when this ſinful ſoul of mine ſhall depart out of this frail Carcaſs of Clay, I may be carried in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy Everlaſting Glory; O Lord, by thy Free Grace, and out of thy infinite mercy hear me, and look down, and have Compaſſion upon me; and thou Lord Jeſus, thou my Lord, and thou my God, and thou my Redeemer, hear me, take pity upon me, take pity upon me, gracious God, and ſo deal with my ſoul, that by thy precious merits I may attain to thy joy and bliſs; O Lord, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member me, ſo miſerable and ſinful a creature; now thou, O Lord, thou (O Lord) that dyed for me, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me, and receive me into thy own bound of mercy; O Lord, I truſt in thee, ſuffer me not now to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded; Satan has had too long poſſeſſion of this ſoul, O let him not now prevail againſt it, but let me (O Lord) from henceforth dwell with thee for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</hi>

My Lord, faſten the Eyes of your Faith upon Jeſus, the Author and Finiſher of your Salvation, who himſelf was brought to a violent death for the Redemption of Mankind; he chearfully ſubmitted to his Fathers good pleaſure; in it, and for us; <hi>Bleſſed and holy is he that hath part</hi> (my Lord) <hi>in the firſt reſurrection</hi>; that is, in the firſt Riſer, Jeſus Chriſt, who is both the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Life; <hi>over him, the ſecond death ſhall have no power</hi>; 'Tis the unſpeakable joy of a Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, that at the hour of death his ſoul hath an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate paſſage from this earthly Tabernacle to that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of endleſs glory, yea to the preſence of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,

Now that gives me more true joy then ever I had, I paſs out of a miſerable world to go into an eternal and glorious Kingdome; and Sir, though I have been a moſt ſinful creature, yet Gods mercy I know is infinite, and I bleſs my God for it, I go with ſo clear a Conſcience, that I know not the man that I have perſonally injured.</p>

                  <p>IT is to no purpoſe (I think) to ſpeak any thing here. Which may muſt I ſpeak? And then being directed to the front of the Scaffold, he (leaning over the Rayls) ſaid; I think it is ſit to ſay ſomething, ſince God hath called me to this place. The firſt thing which I muſt profeſs, is, what concerns my Religion, and my Breeding, which hath been in a good Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that hath ever been faithful to the true Proteſtant Religion, in the which I have been bred, in the which I have lived, and in the which by Gods grace and mercy I ſhall dye. I have not lived according to that Education I had in that Family where I was born and bred. I hope God will forgive me my ſins, ſince I conceive it is very much his pleaſure to bring me to this place, for the ſins that I have committed. The cauſe that hath brought me hither, I believe by many hath been much miſtaken. They have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that I have had ill Deſigns to the State, and to the Kingdome; Truly I look upon it as a Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and a juſt Judgement of God; not but I have offended ſo much the State, and the Kingdome, and the Parliament, as that I have had an extream vanity in ſerving them very extraordinarily. For thoſe Actions that I have done, I think it is known they
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:51765:69"/>
have been ever very faithful to the Publike, and very particularly to Parliaments. My Affections have been ever expreſt truly and clearly to them. The diſpoſitions of Affairs now have put things in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther poſture then they were when I was engaged with the Parliament. I have never gone off from thoſe Principles that ever I have profeſſed; I have lived in them, and by Gods grace will die in them. There may be Alterations and Changes that may carry them further then I thought reaſonable; and truly there I left them: But there hath been nothing that I have ſaid, or done, or profeſſed, either by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant or Declaration, which hath not been very conſtant, and very clear, upon the principles that I ever have gone upon; which was, to ſerve the King, the Parliament, Religion, (I ſhould have ſaid in the firſt place) the Commonwealth, and to ſeek the Peace of the Kingdome; That made me think it no improper time, being preſt out by Accidents and Circumſtances, to ſeek the Peace of the Kingdome, which I thought was proper, ſince there was ſomething then in Agitation, but nothing agreed on for ſending Propoſitions to the King; that was the furtheſt aym that I had, and truly beyond that I had no intention, none at all. And God be praiſed, although my blood comes to be ſhed here, there was I think ſcarce a drop of blood ſhed in that Action that I was enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in. For the preſent Affairs as they are, I cannot tell how to judge of them; and truly they are in ſuch a condition, as (I conceive) nobody can make a judgment of them; and therefore I muſt make uſe of Prayers, rather then of my Opinion; which are, That God would bleſs this Kingdome, this Nation, this State; that he would ſettle it in a way agreeable to what this Kingdome hath been happily governed
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:51765:70"/>
under; by a King, by the Lords, by the Commons; a Government that I conceive it hath flouriſhed much under, and I pray God the change of it bring not rather a prejudice, a diſorder, and a confuſion, then the contrary. I look upon the Poſterity of the King, and truly my Conſcience directs me to it, to deſire, that if God be pleaſed, that theſe People may look upon them with that Affection that they owe, that they may be called in again, and they may be, not through blood, nor through diſorder, admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted again into that power, and to that glory, that God in their Birth intended to them. I ſhall pray with all my ſoul for the happineſs of this State, of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the blood which is here ſpilt, may even be the laſt that may fall among us; and truly I ſhould lay down my life with as much cheerfulneſſe as ever perſon did, if I conceived that there would be no more blood follow us; for a State, or Affairs that are built upon blood, is a foundation for the moſt part that doth not proſper.</p>
                  <p>After the bleſſing that I give to the Nation, to the Kingdome, and truly to the Parliament, I do wiſh with all my heart, happineſs, and a bleſſing to all thoſe that have been Authors in this buſineſs; and truly, that have been Authors in this very work that bringeth us hither: I do not only forgive them, but I pray heartily and really for them; as God will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give my ſins, ſo I deſire God may forgive them.</p>
                  <p>I have a particular relation, as I am Chancellour of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and truly I muſt here, ſince it is the laſt of my prayers, pray to God that that Univerſity may go on in that happy way which it is in, that God may make it a Nurſery to plant thoſe perſons that may be diſtributed to the Kingdom, that the ſouls of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may receive a great benefit, and a great advantage
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:51765:70"/>
by them, and (I hope) God will reward them for their kindneſs, and their affections that I have found from them. <note n="*" place="margin">Looking towards M. <hi>Bolton.</hi>
                     </note> I have ſaid what Religion I have been bred in, what Religion I have been born in, what Religion I have practiſed, I began with it, and I muſt end with it. I told you that my actions and my life have not been agreeable to my Breeding. I have told you likewiſe that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily where I was bred, hath been an exemplary Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily (I may ſay ſo I hope, without vanity) of much affection to Religion, and of much faithfulneſs to this Kingdom and to this State, I have indeavoured to do thoſe actions that became an honeſt man, and a good Engliſh-man, and which became a good Chriſtian. I have been willing to oblige thoſe that have been in trouble, thoſe that have been in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, and truly I find a great reward of it; for I have found their prayers, and their kindneſſe now in this diſtreſſe, and in this condition, and I think it a great reward, I pray God reward them for it.</p>
                  <p>I am a great ſinner, and I hope God will be pleaſed to hear my prayers, to give me faith to truſt in him, that as he hath called me to death at this place, he will make it but a paſſage to an eternal life through Jeſus Chriſt, which I truſt to, which I rely upon, and which I expect by the mercy of God. And ſo I pray God bleſs you all, and ſend that you may ſee this to be the laſt execution, and the laſt blood that is likely to be ſpilt among you.

                  <p>My Lord, <hi>Now look upon him whom you have truſted. My Lord, I hope that here is your laſt prayer, there will no more prayers remain, but praiſes: And I hope that after
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:51765:71"/>
this day is over, there will a day begin that ſhall never have end; And I look upon this (my Lord) the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it, the morning of that day. My Lord, You know where your fulneſs lies, where your riches lie, where is your only rock to anchor on. You know there is fulneſs in Chriſt; If the Lord comes not in with ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Comfort to You, yet reſolve to wait upon him while You live, and to truſt in him when You die; and then ſay, I will die here, I will periſh at thy feet, I will be found dead at the feet of Jeſus Chriſt. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he that came to ſeek and ſave loſt ſinners, will not reject loſt ſinners when they come to ſeek him; He that entreateth us to come, will not ſlight us when we come to entreat him. My Lord, there is enough there, and fix your heart there, and fix Your Eies there, that Eye of Faith, and that Eye of Hope; Exerciſe theſe Graces now, there will be no exerciſe hereafter. As Your Lordſhip ſaid, Here take an end of Faith, and take an end of Hope, and take a Farewel of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; and all theſe, and welcome God, and welcome Chriſt, and welcome Glory, and welcome Happineſs to all Eternity; and ſo it will be a happy paſſage then, if it be a paſſage here from miſery to happineſs. And though it be but a ſad way, yet if it will bring You into the preſence of joy, although it be a valley of tears, although it be a ſhadow of death, yet if God will pleaſe to bring You, and make it a paſſage to that happineſs, welcome Lord. And I doubt not but God will give You a heart to taſt ſome ſweetneſs and love in this bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Potion, and to ſee ſomething of Mercy and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to You, and ſhew You ſome ſigne and token of good, ſo that Your ſoul may ſee that which we have had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready experience of (bleſſed be God for it) many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences, many Expreſſions, not onely in words, but tears; God hath not left us without much comfort, nor
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:51765:71"/>
evidence; and I hope <hi>(my Lord)</hi> You that have given ſo many Evidences to us, I hope You want none Your ſelf; but that the Lord will be pleaſed to ſupport You, and bear up Your Spirit, and if there want evidence, there is reliance; my ſecurity lies not in my knowing that I ſhall come to Heaven, and come to Glory, but in my reſting and relying upon him: When the A<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Holland,</hi> M. <hi>Bolton,</hi> God hath given me long time in this world; he hath carried me through many great accidents of Fortune; he hath at laſt brought me down into a condition, where I find my ſelf brought to an end, for a diſ-affection to this State, to this Parliament, that (as I ſaid before) I did believe no body in the world more unlikely to have expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſuffer for that Cauſe; I look upon it as a great judgement of God for my ſins.

It is not long ſince the King my Maſter paſſed in the ſame manner; and truly I hope that his purpoſes and intentions were ſuch, as a man may not be aſhamed, not onely to follow him in the way that was taken with him, but likewiſe not aſhamed of his purpoſes, if God had given him life. I have often diſputed with him concerning many things of this kind, and I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his ſufferings, and his better knowledge, and better underſtanding (if God had ſpared him life) might have made him a Prince very happy towards himſelf, and very happy towards this Kingdom. I have ſeen and known that thoſe bleſſed ſouls in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven have paſſed thither by the gate of ſorrow, and many by the gate of violence; and ſince it is Gods pleaſure to diſpoſe me this way, I ſubmit my ſoul to him, with all comfort, and with all hope; that he hath made this my end, and this my concluſion, that though I be low in death, yet nevertheleſſe this lowneſſe ſhall raiſe me to the higheſt glory for ever.</p>
                  <p>Truly, I have not ſaid much in publick to the people, concerning the particular Actions that I conceive I have done by my counſels in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; I conceive they are well known; it were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of vanity (methinks,) to take notice of them here: I'le rather die with them, with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of them in my own boſom; and that I never intended in this action, or any action that ever I did in my life, either malice, or bloud-ſhed, or prejudice to any creature that lives. For that which concerns my Religion, I made my profeſſion before of it, how I was bred, and in what manner I was bred, in a Family that was looked
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:51765:72"/>
upon to be no little notorious in oppoſition to ſome liberties they have conceived then to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; and truly, there was ſome mark upon me, as if I had ſome taint of it, even throughout my whole ways that I have taken: every body knows what my affections have been to many that have ſuffered, to many that have been in troubles in this Kingdom, I endeavourad to relieve them, I endeavoured to oblige them, I thought I was tyed ſo by my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, I thought it by my charity, and truly, very much by my Breeding; God hath now brought me to the laſt inſtant of my time, all that I can ſay, and all that I can adhere unto is this; That as I am a great ſinner, ſo I have a great Saviour; that as he hath given me here a fortune to come publickly in a ſhew of ſhame in the way of this ſuffering (truly I underſtand it not to be ſo) I underſtand it to be a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; a glory, when I conſider who hath gone before me, and a glory when I conſider I had no end in it, but what I conceive to be the ſervice of God, the King and the Kingdom, and therefore my heart is not charged much with any thing in that particular, ſince I conceive God will accept of the intention, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the action ſeems to be. I am going to dye, and the Lord receive my Soul; I have no relyance but upon Chriſt: for my ſelf, I do acknowledge that I am the unworthyeſt of ſinners; my life hath been a vanity, and a continued ſin, and God may juſtly bring me to this end, for the ſins I have committed againſt him, and were there nothing elſe but the iniquities that I have committed in the Way of my Life, I look upon this as a great Juſtice of God, to bring me to this Suffering, and to bring me to this Puniſhment; And thoſe Hands that have been moſt active in it,

if any ſuch there hath been; I pray God forgive them; I pray God that there may not be many ſuch Trophies of their Victories, but that this may be (as I ſaid before) the laſt Shew, that this People ſhall ſee, of the Blood of Perſons of Condition, of Perſons of Honour: I might ſay ſomething of the Way of our Tryall, which certainly hath been as extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, as any thing I think hath ever been ſeen in this Kingdom; but becauſe that I would not ſeem as if I made ſome complaint, I will not ſo much as men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it, becauſe no body ſhall believe I repine at their actions, that I repine at my Fortune; it is the will of God, it is the hand of God under whom I fall; I take it entirely from him, I ſubmit my ſelf to him, I ſhall deſire to roul my ſelf into the Arms of my bleſſed Saviour; and when I come to this <note n="*" place="margin">Pointing to the Block.</note> place, when I bow down my ſelf there, I hope God will raiſe me up; and when I bid farewell, as I muſt now to Hope and to Faith, that Love will abide; I know nothing to accompany the ſoul out of this World, but Love; and I hope that Love will bring me to the Fountain of Glory in Heaven, through the Arms, Mediation, and the Mercy of my Saviour <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> in whom I Believe, O Lord help my Unbelief.</p>

                     <hi>But my Lord, when you are cloathed with the righteouſneſſe of another, you will appear glorious, though now ſinfull in your ſelf: The Apoſtle ſaith,</hi> I deſire not to be found in my own righteouſneſs, <hi>and when you are cloathed with another, the Lord will own you, and I ſhall ſay but thus much: Doubt not that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver God will deny ſalvation to ſinners, that come to him, when the end of all his death and ſufferings was the ſalvation of ſinners, when as I ſay the whole end, and the whole deſign, and the great work, that God had to do in the world, by the death of Chriſt, wherein he laid out all his councells, and infinite wiſdom, and mercy, and goodneſs, beyond which there was a</hi> Non ultra, <hi>in Gods thoughts, what this was the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and great end, the ſalvation of ſinners, that poor ſouls ſhould come over to him and live; certainly when ſinners come he will not reject, he will not refuſe. And my Lord, do but think of this, the greateſt work that ever was done in the world, was the bloud of Chriſt that was ſhed, never any thing like it: and this blood of Christ that was ſhed, never any thing like it: And this blood of Chriſt that was ſhed, was ſhed for them that come, if not for them, for none, it was in vain elſe: you ſee the Devills they are out of capacity of good by it, the Angels they have no need of it, wicked men will not come, and there are but a few that come over, but a few that come over, and ſhould
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:51765:74"/>
he deny them, there were no end nor fruit of the bloud and ſufferings of the Lord Jeſus: and had your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip been with Christ in that bloudy agony, when he was in that bloudy ſweat, ſweating drops of bloud, if you had asked him, Lord, what art thou now a doing, art thou not now reconciling an angry God and me toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, art thou not pacifying the wrath of God? art thou not interpoſing thy ſelf between the juſtice of God and my ſoul? Would he not have ſaid, yea? and ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then he will not deny it now. My Lord, His paſſions are over, his compaſſions ſtill remain, and the larger and greater, becauſe he is gone up into a higher place that he may throw down more abundance of his mercy and grace upon you, and my Lord, think of that infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite love, that abundance of riches in Chriſt: I am loſt, I am empty, I have nothing, I am poor, I am ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: be it ſo, as bad as God will make me, and as vile as I poſſibly can conceive my ſelf, I am willing to be: but when I have ſaid all, the more I advance that riches, and honour that grace of God. And why ſhould I doubt when by this he puts me into a capacity, into a diſpoſition for him to ſhew we mercy, that by this I may the better advance the riches of his grace, and ſay grace, grace, to the Lord, to all eternity, that God ſhould own ſuch a Creature, that deſerves nothing; and the leſſe I deſerve, the more conſpicuous is his grace: and this is certain, the riches of his grace he throweth amongst men, that the glory of his grace might be given to himſelf, if we can give him but the glory of his grace, we ſhall never doubt to partake of the riches of it, and that fulneſſe, My Lord, that fulneſs be your comfort, that fulneſſe of mercy, that fulneſſe of love, that fulneſſe of righteouſneſs and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er be now your riches, and your onely stay, and the Lord interpoſe himſelf between God and you, as your

Faith hath indeavoured to interpoſe him between God and your ſoul; ſo I doubt not but there he ſtands (my Lord) to plead for you, and when you are not able to do any thing your ſelf, yet lie down at the feet of him that is a mercifull Saviour, and knowes what you would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and wait upon him while you live, truſt in him when you die, there is riches enough and mercy enough, if he open not, yet die at his doore, ſay there I'le die, there is mercy enough.</hi>

                  <p>The concluſion that I made with thoſe that ſent me hither, and are the cauſe of this violent death of mine, ſhall be the beginning of what I ſhall ſay to you: When I made an addreſs to them (which was the laſt) I told them with much ſincerity, that I would pray to the God of all mercies that they might be partakers of his ineſtimable and boundleſs mercies in Jeſus Chriſt; and truly I ſtill pray that prayer;
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:51765:77"/>
and I beſeech the God of Heaven forgive any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury they have done to me, from my ſoul I wiſh it. And truly, this I tell you as a Chriſtian, to let you ſee I am a Chriſtian. But it is neceſſary I ſhould tell you ſomewhat more, that I am a Proteſtant: And truly, I am a Proteſtant, and very much in love with the profeſſion of it, after the manner as it was eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in <hi>England</hi> by the thirty nine Articles; a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed way of profeſſion, and ſuch an one as truly, I never knew none ſo good. I am ſo far from being a Papiſt, which ſome body have (truly) very unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily at ſome time charged me withall, that truly I profeſs to you, that though I love good works, and commend good works, yet I hold they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all to doe in the matter of ſalvation; my Anchor-hold is this, <hi>That Christ loved me, and gave himſelf for me</hi>; that is that that I reſt upon. And truly ſomething I ſhall ſay to you as a Citizen of the whole world, and in that conſideration I am here condemned to die, truly contrary to the Law that governs all the world, that is, the Law of the Sword: I had the protection of that for my life, and the honor of it; but truly, I will not trouble you much with that, becauſe in another place I have ſpoken very largely and liberally about it. I believe you will hear by other means what Arguments I uſed in that caſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But truly, that, that is ſtranger, you that are Engliſhmen behold here an Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man here before you, and acknowledged a Peer, not condemned to die by any Law of <hi>England,</hi> not by any Law of <hi>England</hi>; nay, ſhall I tell you more? (which is ſtrangeſt of all) contrary to all the Lawes of <hi>England</hi> that I know of. And truly I will tell you, in the matter of the civil part of my death, and the cauſe that I have maintained, I die (I take it
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:51765:78"/>
for maintaining the fifth Commandement, injoyned by God himſelf, which injoyns reverence and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Parents: All Divines on all hands, though they contradict one another in many ſeverall Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yet all Divines on all hands doe acknowledge, that here is intended Magiſtracy and Order; and certainly I have obeyed that Magiſtracy and that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der under which I have lived, which I was bound to obey: and truly, I do ſay very confidently, that I do die here for keeping, for obeying that fifth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement given by God himſelf, and written with his own finger. And now, Gentlemen, I will take this opportunity to tell you, That I cannot imitate a better nor a greater ingenuity then his, that ſaid of himſelf, <hi>For ſuffering an unjuſt judgment upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, himſelf was brought to ſuffer by an unjuſt judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Truly, Gentlemen, that God may be glorified, that all men that are concerned in it may take the occaſion of it, of humble repentance to God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty for it, I doe here profeſs to you, that I did give my Vote to that Bill againſt the Earl of <hi>Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>; I doubt not but God almighty hath waſhed that away with a more precious bloud, the blood of his own Son, and my dear Saviour Jeſus Chriſt; and I hope he will waſh it away from all thoſe that are guilty of it: truly, this I may ſay, I had not the leaſt part nor degree of malice in doing of it; but I muſt confeſs again to Gods glory, and the accuſation of mine own frailty, and the frailty of my Nature, that truly it was unworthy Cowardize, not to reſiſt ſo great a torrent as carried that buſineſſe at that time. And truly, this I think I am moſt guilty of, of not courage enough it it, but malice I had none; but what ſoever it was, God I am ſure hath pardoned it, hath given me the aſſurance of it, that
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:51765:78"/>
Chriſt Jeſus his bloud hath waſhed it away; and truly, I do from my ſoul wiſh, that all men that have any ſtain by it, may ſeriouſly repent, and receive a remiſſion and pardon from God for it. And now, Gentlemen, we have had an occaſion by this intimation to remember his Majeſty, our King that laſt was; and I cannot ſpeak of him, nor think of it, but truly, I muſt needs ſay, that in my opinion, that have had time to conſider all the Images of all the greateſt and vertuouſeſt Princes in the world; and truly, in my opinion, there was not a more vertuous, and more ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Prince known in the world, then our gracious King <hi>Charls</hi> that died laſt: God almighty preſerve our King that now is, his Son; God ſend him mo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e fortunate and longer daies; God Almighty ſo aſſiſt him, that he may exceed both the vertues and ſufficiencies of his Father: For certainly, I that have been a Counſellor to him, and have lived long with him, and in a time when diſcovery is eaſily enough made, for he was young (he was about thirteen, fourteen, fifteen or ſixteen years of age) thoſe years I was with him, truly, I never ſaw greater hopes of vertue in any young perſon then in him; great judgement, great underſtanding, great apprehenſion, much honour in his nature, and truly a very perfect Engliſhmen in his inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and I pray God reſtore him to this Kingdom, and unite the Kingdoms one unto another, and ſend a great happineſſe both to you and to him, that he may long live and reign among you, and that that Family may reign till thy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome come, that is, while all temporall power is conſummated: I beſeech God of his mercy, give much happineſſe to this your King, and to
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:51765:79"/>
you that in it ſhall be his Subjects by the grace of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Truly I like my beginning ſo well, that I will make my concluſion with it, that is, That God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty would confer, of his infinite and ineſtimable grace and mercy, to thoſe that are the cauſers of my coming hither, I pray God give them as much mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy as their hearts can wiſh; and truly, for my part, I will not accuſe any one of them of malice, truly I will not; nay, I will not think there was any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice in them: what other ends there is, I know not, nor will I examine; but let it be what it will, from my very ſoul I forgive them every one. And ſo the Lord of heaven bleſs you all, God almighty be infinite in goodneſs and mercy to you, and direct you in thoſe ways of obedience to his commands to His Majeſty, that this Kingdom may be an happy and glorious Nation again, and that your King may be an happy King in ſo good and ſo obedient people. God almighty keep you all, God almighty preſerve this Kingdom, God almighty preſerve you all.</p>
                  <p>Then turning about, and looking for the Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner (who was gone off the Scaffold) ſaid, which is the Gentleman? which is the man? Anſwer was made, He is coming; He then ſaid, Stay, I muſt pull off my Doublet firſt, and my Waſt-coat: and then the Executioner being come upon the Scaffold, the Lord <hi>Capel</hi> ſaid, O friend! prethee come hither: Then the Executioner kneeling down, the Lord <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel</hi> ſaid, I forgive thee from my ſoul, and not onely forgive thee, but I ſhall pray to God to give thee all grace for a better life: There is five pounds for thee; and truly, for my clothes, and thoſe things, if there be any thing due to you for it, you ſhall be fully recompenced: but I deſire my body may not
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:51765:79"/>
be ſtripped here, and no body to take notice of my body but my own ſervants. Look you friend, this I ſhall deſire of you, that when I lie down you would give me a time for a particular ſhort prayer.</p>

And when turning to one of his ſervants, ſaid, <hi>Baldwin,</hi> I cannot ſee any thing that belongs to my wife; but I muſt deſire thee and beſeech her to reſt wholly upon Jeſus Chriſt, to be contented and fully ſatisfied: and then ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Servants, he ſaid, God keep you; and Gentlemen, let me now do a buſineſs quickly, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately, and pray let me have your prayers at the moment of death, that God would receive my ſoul.</p>

               <p>WHen he was brought out of priſon, looking upon the Sledge that was there ſet for him, lifting up his eyes to Heaven, knocking upon his breaſt, he ſaid, I am as willing to go to my death, as to put off my doublet to go to bed, I deſpiſe the ſhame as well as the Croſſe, I know I am going to a joyfull place; with many like expreſſions.</p>
               <p>When the Poſt met him about St. <hi>Jame</hi>'s Church, that was ſent to the Parliament to mediate for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preive; and told him he could not prevaile in it, he ſaid; Sir, I pray God reward you for your pains, I hope and am well aſſured to find a better pardon then any they can give, my hope is not in man but in the living God.</p>
               <p>At the place of execution he made this profeſſion of his faith, his breeding, his cauſe he had fought in.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, firſt I was bred up in the true Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion, having my education and breeding, from that honoured houſe my Dear Lord and Maſter <hi>Strafford,</hi> which place I dare boldly ſay, was as well governed and ruled as ever any yet was before it, I much doubt, better then any will be after it; unleſſe it pleaſe God to put a period to theſe diſtracted times: this Faith and Religion, I ſay, I have been bred in, and I thank God I have hitherto lived in,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:51765:81"/>
without the leaſt wavering, and now I am reſolved by Gods aſſiſtance to dye in.</p>
               <p>Thoſe paines are nothing, if compared to thoſe dolours and pains which Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour hath ſuffered for us, when in a bloody ſweat he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured the wrath of God, the pains of hell, and the curſed and ſhamefull death which was due to our ſinnes; Therefore I praiſe the Lord that I am not plagued with farre more grievous puniſhment, that the like hath befaln others, who undoubtedly are moſt glorious and bleſſed Saints with Chriſt in heaven: It is the Lords affliction; and who will not take any af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction in good part when it comes from the hand of God? and what? ſhall we receive good from the hands of God, and not receive evil? And though I deſire, as I am carnall, that this cup may depart from me, yet not my will but thy will be done. Death brings unto the godly an end of ſinning, and of all miſeries due unto ſin, ſo that after death there ſhall be no more ſorrow, nor cry or pain, for God ſhall wipe away all tears from our eyes; by death our ſouls ſhall be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from thraldome, and this corruptible body ſhall put on incorruption, and this mortall immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality.</p>
               <p>Therefore bleſſed are they that are delivered out of ſo vile a world, and freed from ſuch a body of bondage and corruption; the ſoul ſhall enjoy imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Communion with God in everlaſting bliſſe and glory; it takes us from the miſeries of this world, and ſociety of ſinners, to the city of the living God, the celeſtial Jeruſalem.</p>
               <p>I bleſſe God I am thought worthy to ſuffer for his Name, and for ſo good a cauſe; and if I had a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand lives I would willingly lay them down for the cauſe of my King, the Lords <hi>Anointed</hi>: the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture

I have ſome five or ſix years ſince ingaged to this War, wherein I had no other end or intention but to doe my King true and faithfull ſervice, according to my duty and the dictate of my Conſcience; I have not done ſo much ſervice as I deſired, but I have been always faithfull to him, and wiſh I could have done him more; and for his ſon the King that now is, I wonder any man of this Kingdome ſhould have the boldneſs or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence to lift up his hand againſt him, to keep him from his Crown whereof he is Heir apparent, and hath as good right and title to it by his Birthright, as any man living hath of his Inheritance or Poſſeſſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <head>The Speech of Colonel <hi>Euſebius Andrews</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately before his Execution on the Scaffold on <hi>Tower-hill,</hi> on
Thurſday <hi>Auguſt 22. 1650.</hi>
being attended on by D. <hi>Swadling.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>AS ſoon as he came upon the Scaffold, kiſſing the block, he ſaid, I hope there is no more but this Block between me and Heaven; and to the <hi>Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> of the <hi>Tower</hi> he ſaid, I hope I ſhall neither tire in my way, nor go out of it. After he had been a good while upon the Scaffold, turning to the rail, he ſpeaks to the people as followeth; <hi>Chriſtian Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and people,</hi> Your buſineſs hither to day is to ſee a ſad ſpectacle, a man to be in a moment unman'd, and cut off in the prime of his years, taken from fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther opportunities of doing good either to himſelf, his friends, the <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> or eſpecially to God; It ſeldom happens but upon very good cauſe. And though truly, if my general known courſe of life were but inquired into, I may modeſtly ſay there is ſuch a moral honeſty upon it, as ſome may be ſo ſawcy as to expoſtulate why this great Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is fallen upon me; but know, I am able to give them and my ſelf an anſwer, and out of this breaſt am able to give a better account of my Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Execution then my <hi>Judges</hi> themſelves, or you are able to give; It is Gods wrath upon me for ſins long unrepented of, many Judgements with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and mercies ſlighted; therefore God hath whipped me by his ſevere rod of correction, that he
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:51765:83"/>
might not loſe me: I pray joyn with me in prayer that it may not be a fruitleſs rod, that when by this rod I have laid down my life, by this ſtaffe I may be comforted, and received into glory. I am very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident by what I have heard ſince my ſentence, there is more exception made againſt proceedings againſt me then I ever made. My Tryers had a Law, and the value of that Law is indiſputable, and for me to make a queſtion of it, I ſhould ſhame my ſelf and my diſcretion. In the ſtrictneſſe of that Law ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is done by me that is applicable to ſome clauſe therein, by which I ſtand condemnable: the means whereby I was brought under that interpretation of that which was not in my ſelf intended maliciouſly, being teſtimony given (by perſons whom I pity) ſo falſe, yet ſo poſitive, that I cannot condemn my <hi>Judges</hi> for paſſing ſentence againſt me accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to legall Juſtice; for equity lieth in higher breaſts.</p>
               <p>As for my accuſers, or rather betrayers, I pity, and am ſorry for them they have committed <hi>Judas</hi> his crime; but I wiſh and pray for them <hi>Peters tears,</hi> that by <hi>Peters</hi> repentance they may eſcape <hi>Judas</hi> his puniſhment; and I wiſh other people ſo happy, they may be taken up betimes before they have drunk up more bloud of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> men poſſibly leſs deſerving then my ſelf.</p>
               <p>It is true, there have been ſeverall addreſſes made for mercy, and I will put the obſtruction of it upon nothing more then upon my own ſin, and ſeeing God ſees it ſit, (having not glorified him in my life) I might do it in my death, which I am contented to do. I profeſs in the face of God, particular malice to any one of State or Parliament, to do them a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily injury I had none.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:51765:84"/>For the cauſe in which I had long waded, I muſt needs ſay, my engagement or continuance in it hath laid no ſcruple upon my Conſcience, it was on prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Law: the knowledge whereof I profeſſe, and on principles of <hi>Religion</hi> my <hi>Judgment</hi> ſatisfied, and <hi>Conſcience</hi> rectified, that I have purſued thoſe ways which I bleſs God I find no blackneſs upon my Conſcience, nor have I put it into the bed-roll of my ſins.</p>
               <p>I will not preſume to decide controverſies; I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire God to honour himſelf in proſpering that ſide that hath right with it, and that you may enjoy peace and plenty, when I ſhall enjoy peace and plenty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all you poſſeſs here; in my converſation in the world, I do not know where I have an enemy with cauſe, or that there is ſuch a perſon whom I have to regret; but if there be any whom I cannot recollect, under the notion of <hi>Christian</hi> men, I pardon them, as freely as if I had named them by name, I freely forgive them, being in free peace with all the world, as I deſire God for Chriſts ſake, to be at peace with me. For the buſineſs of death, it is a ſad ſentence in it ſelf, if men conſult with fleſh and blood: But truly without boaſting, I ſay it, or if I doe boaſt, I boaſt in the Lord, I have not to this minute, had one conſultation with the fleſh about the blow of the <hi>Axe,</hi> or one thought of the <hi>Axe,</hi> more then as my paſſe-port to glory.</p>
               <p>I take it for an honour, and I owe thankfulneſs to thoſe under whoſe power I am, that they have ſent me hither to a place, however of puniſhment, yet of ſome honour to die a death, ſomewhat worthy of my bloud, anſwerable to my birth and qualification, and this courteſie of theirs hath much helped toward; the pacification of my mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:51765:84"/>I ſhall deſire God that thoſe <hi>Gentlemen</hi> in that fad beadrol to be tried by the H.

               </p>
               <p>I deſire you now that you would pray for me, and not give over praying till the hour of death, not till the moment of death, for the hour is come already, that as I have a great load of ſins, ſo I may have the wings of your prayers, to help thoſe <hi>Angels</hi> that are to convey my ſoul to Heaven, and I doubt not, but I ſhall ſee my Saviour, my gallant Maſter the King of <hi>England,</hi> and another Mr. whom I much honoured, my Lord <hi>Capel,</hi> hopeing this day to ſee my <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the preſence of the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> in the preſence of him, my Lord <hi>Capel</hi> in the preſence of them all; and my ſelf there to rejoyce with all other <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi> for evermore.</p>

                     </gap>ian-like before, I have rather been a Scholler to learn from you, then an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructer: I wiſh this Stage wherein you are made a
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:51765:86"/>
ſpectacle to God, Angels, and the World, may be a School to all about you; for though I will not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh your ſins, not ſhall I conceal, nor hypocrize my own, for they are great ones betwixt God and my ſelf, yet I think there is few here have a lighter load upon them then you have, if we conſider things well, and I only wiſh them your repentance, and that meaſure of faith God hath given you, and that meaſure of courage you have attained from God, and that conſtant perſeverance God hath crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned you with hitherto.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Here the Doctor prayed with him almost a quarter of an hour, after which, the</hi> Col. <hi>turning himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to the people, spake as followeth.</hi> One thing more I deſire to be clear in. There lieth a common imputation upon the Cavaliers, that they are Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, and under that name we are made odious to thoſe of the contrary opinion: I am not a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt, but renounce the <hi>Pope</hi> with all his depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies, when the diſtractions in <hi>Religion</hi> firſt ſprang up, I might have been thought apt to turn from this Church to the <hi>Roman,</hi> but was utterly unſatisfied in their Doctrine, in point of faith, and very much, as to their diſcipline. The Religion which I profeſſe, is that which paſſeth under the name of <hi>Protestant,</hi> though that be rather a name of diſtinction, then properly eſſential to Religion. But the Religion which was found out in the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation purged from all the errours of <hi>Rome</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> 6. practiced in the Reigns of Queen <hi>Elizabeth, K. James</hi> and <hi>K. Charles,</hi> that bleſſed Prince deceaſed, that Religion before it was defaced, I am of, which I take to be Chriſts Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, though not the Roman Catholick Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:51765:86"/>
in the profeſſion and practice whereof, I will live and die, that for my Religion. Then he tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned himſelf unto the Executioner, I have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to quarrel with thee, thou art not the hand that throws the ſtone; I am not of ſuch an Eſtate to be liberall, but there is three pound for thee, which is all I have. Now tell me what I lack. <hi>Executioner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Your hair to be turned up. Col. Shew me how to fit my ſelf upon the block. After which his doublet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off, and hair turned up, he turned again to the people, and prayed a good while. Before he laid down upon the block, he spake again to the people.</hi> viz. There is not one face that looks upon me, though many faces, and perhaps different from me in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and practice, but (methinks) hath ſomething of pity in it; and may that mercy which is in your hearts, fall into your own boſoms when you have need of it; and may you never find ſuch blocks of ſin to ſtand in the way of your mercy, as I have met with. I beſeech you joyn with me in prayer. Then he prayed (leaning on the Scaffold) with an audible voice for about a quarter of an hour; having done, he had ſome private conference with Doctor <hi>Swadling</hi>; then taking his leave of his friends, Sheriffs, and acquaintance, ſaluting them all with a courteous valediction, he prepared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for the block, kneeling down ſaid, let me try the block, which he did; after caſting his eyes up, and fixing them very intentively upon Heaven, he ſaid, when I ſay Lord Jeſus receive me, Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner do thine Office, then kiſſing the Axe he laid down, and with as much undaunted, yet Chriſtian courage as poſſibly as could be in man, did he expoſe his throat to the fatall Axe, his life to the Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and commended his ſoul into the hands of a
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:51765:87"/>
faithfull and mercifull Creator, through the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious paſſion of a gracious Redeemer, ſaying the forementioned words, his head was ſmitten off at one blow.</p>

               <p>I pray all of you joyn with me to praiſe this Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:51765:88"/>
God, to whom I deſire to render all hearty thanks; as for all his mercies, ſo in in particular for this, That he hath brought me hither: That whereas I owe a duty to Sin and to Nature, that now can pay the account: A debt to Nature, I can pay it upon the account or Grace. And becauſe it is ſit to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an account of that Hope that is in me, I ſhall tell you, to the praiſe of Almighty God, That I have been born and bred up in the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> I have no Negative Religion, believing to be ſaved by the onely merits of my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Jeſus Chriſt, (<hi>putting off his Hat</hi>) and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever elſe is profeſt in the Doctrine and Diſcipline of the Church of <hi>England</hi> authorized by Law; humbly beſeeching almighty God to reſtore unto this Church her Peace, Proſperity and Patrimony, whereof I have been an obedient and a loving (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever an unworthy) Son. And now both my Hope being confident, and my Faith perfected, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains onely Chriſtian Charity; Charity we carry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven, Charity on Earth, and that I leave, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching all whomſoever I have offended (whether I have or no) to forgive me, as I from the bottom of my heart do them whomſoever; bleſſing Almighty God for the happy advantage he takes to bring me nearer to heaven; bleſſing Almighty God, that he hath given me this advantage, as he hath been mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull to me before the foundation of the World, in my Saviour, ſo that now he hath in mercy honoured me, with a ſuffering for his Name, in obedience to his Commandement.</p>
               <p>On this day ſeven night I was ſummoned before that Juſtice, which ondemned me on Friday laſt, praiſed be Almighty God, that by this way he hath brought me the nearer to Himſelf (<hi>putting off his hat</hi>) My
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:51765:89"/>
Charge I preſume is publike, as my Puniſhment is viſible: if there have been any thing in the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my part, being unskilfull, having diſconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued my own Country many years, I ſhall beſeech the Chriſtian charity of all you, my beloved Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-men, to impute it unto the right part, the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that is in this skilfull way of managing: It was objected unto me there, That I had a vanity of delighting in ſtrange Tongues. I was beſt skill'd in the <hi>Italian</hi> (but free from that vanity, I thank Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God) and therefore I would in defence of my life (if it had been the Cuſtome here, or the Judges favour) have uſed that Language.</p>
               <p>It was objected, That I did not ſo freely as a tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row-paced Cavalier, own my Maſter: I was told ſince I came into <hi>England</hi> (for other skill I have not in your Lawes) that a legal Denial in Law might be tolerable; I hope I did not exceed the bounds of that in any thing, for God forbid that I ſhould be aſhamed of ſerving ſo good, ſo pious, ſo juſt a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>(putting off his hat)</hi> for that I therein rejoyce, and I humbly beſeech almighty God to fill my heart and my tongue, and all that hear me this day, with thankfulneſs for it.</p>
               <p>As to the Buſineſs, that another conſtruction had been made and believed here, then what was there, the righteous God knoweth it; if any weakneſs was in the management, that was mine: I was ſent to ſerve and protect, not to injure any: and as God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quits me of the intention in matter of Fact, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving done any manner of evil that way, however here underſtood, bleſſed be his holy Name, <hi>(putting off his hat</hi>) ſo thoſe Gentlemen of the Turkey Company, if they would ſeriouſly conſider, for they know it very well, the impoſſibility of my do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:51765:89"/>
them any manner of harm. Whereas that of the Embaſſie objected againſt me, that my Maſter never honored me withall, I was never worthy of it, I was his Meſſenger, an <hi>Internuncio,</hi> for the conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation only of his good Subjects, of all the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, untill ſuch time as he could confirm that Gentleman now Reſident, or to ſend any other; and they themſelves know that there was impoſſibility in me (as I bleſs God there was an innocency in me) unto any ſuch intention to doe them any harm; for my Maſters Commands were point-blank the contrary; I was onely ſent for their good, as I never owned the Title, ſo the very Letters themſelves ſpeaking no other: I never did ſo much as think of any manner of Addreſs unto the <hi>Grand Seignior,</hi> but gave him the Letter from my Maſter; the reſt of the Engliſh Nation that were there preſent, may, when they pleaſe, aſſert ſo much. This I would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, that thoſe Gentlemen, as they have been loſers by the miſcarriages of others, may now have no breach of their charity with me; but if it be, as it ſeems it is now in this Country, a Sin to be Loyal, I hope my God hath forgiven that, when it is upon harmleſs employment, not invading any, according to his juſt Maſters Order; for indeed I have been alwayes bred up in that Religion, my Allegiance hath been incorporated into my Religion, and I have thought it a great part of the ſervice due from me to Almighty God, to ſerve the King <hi>(putting off his hat.)</hi> I need not make any Apology for any thing in relation to the preſent things in <hi>England,</hi> for were I, (as I ſpake before my Judges) were I as evil as my Sentence hath here made me black, it were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for me to have prejudiced any body in <hi>England,</hi> or to <hi>England</hi> belonging, in that imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:51765:90"/>
but I bleſſe God for his infinite mercy in Jeſus Chriſt (<hi>putting off his hat</hi>) who hath brought me home to him here in this way, it was the beſt Phyſick for the curing of my Soul, and thoſe that have done it, have no more power in then that of my body. I leave nothing behind me, but that I am willing to part withall, all that I am going to is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable: And that you may all know that Almighty God hath totally wrought in me a totall Deniall of my ſelf, and that there is that perfect Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of me within, and of my own corruptions, by the bleſſed Aſſiſtance of his holy Spirit, I deſire Almighty God in the abundance of the bowels of his mercy in Jeſus Chriſt, not onely to forgive every Enemy, (if any ſuch be in the world, here or whereſoever) but to bring him into his boſom ſo much good and particular comfort, as he may at any time, whether the Cauſe were juſt or unjuſt, have wiſhed me any manner of evill, for I take him to be the happy inſtrument of bringing me to heaven. It is tedious, but I have an inward comfort, I bleſs Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God: (pray Gentlemen give me leave, <hi>speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tng to ſome that prest upon him</hi>) I ſhould never do it but to give ſatisfaction to all charitable Hearts.

in the world, that are not the <hi>Grand Seignior's</hi> Slaves; and we that are Merchants abroad, we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low our ſelves any ſufferance that may induce to our own ſafety, inlargement of Trade, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of what is ours. Why I had by the grace of my gracious Maſter a confirmation of my old Commiſſion of <hi>Conſulage</hi> in <hi>Greece</hi>: but as to the Embaſſie, no more then my Credentiall Letters did ſpeak, nor no more then that I attempted, an <hi>Internuncio</hi> they call it in thoſe places, which is a Meſſenger between the one and the other King. They both unhappily died of ſeverall deaths, and both violent too: And it is a cuſtom not unknown to you, Maſter Sheriff, and other Gentlemen that practice in the world, that Princes of courſe, for the continuation of amity do ſend Meſſengers where there is peace, that the tranſaction of thoſe publick expreſſions of reciprocall Affections may be performed; but for Embaſſie, God forbid I ſhould own it, I never had it, however they have uſed it as the happy means to bring me to God this day. I beſeech God in the bowels of my Saviour, to forgive thoſe people that have done it, I owe them no harm, ſo God pay them home with all the good of this, and an everlaſting life.</p>
                  <p>As for Power, I have been long abſent here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> I meddle with none: Sufficient to me in Gods grace to the ſalvation of my ſoul.</p>
                  <p>I have been alwayes fearfull of offending Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, according to the grace he hath given me: but to learn new Religion, and new Ways, (that I muſt ſay Maſter Sheriff to you, and all others that hear me) I cannot diſpence with my Conſcience to give offence to Almighty God. I am now (if it may be with your Commiſſion, Maſter Sheriff)
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:51765:91"/>
to pour out my ſoul to Almighty God in two or three words (the place is ſtraitned.) If I knew wherein to give any ſatisfaction to any thing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, wherein I have offended or no, I am here in the fear of God to do it. I forgive them with all my ſoul, and my forgiveneſs is clear, as I am now go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to receive Happineſs at the hand of my Saviour: But if I thought it were ſatisfaction to Sir <hi>Thomas Bendiſh,</hi> and all the Company, or any who think they have offended me, I am come Maſter Sheriff to pay that Obedience Willingly; that Debt I owe to Nature, to pay it upon the ſcore of a Subject; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Conſcience within me, tells me not, that for the intentions of ſerving my Prince, that I could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſuch a Death, though ten thouſand times more other ways.</p>

I cannot an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer Objections; I find a man may be in <hi>Turky,</hi> or
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:51765:91"/>
in any place, all the World over, where they will give that Language which they hold ſitting; but this is beneath me. Bleſſed be Almighty God, that hath called me to the Knowledge of him, and this ready Obedience which I pray, and mercifull ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting of my Saviour, and patient Death: And I beſeech you all, whatſoever you are, that you will accompany me with your Prayers, whereby my Soul may be aſſiſted within me, in that paſſage to my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour whither I am going. I am weak of body; I have diſcontinued long from the Kingdom, I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with new Forms, I have deſired to ſerve God according to his Commandments after the Old way: I have begged mercy of God for all my offences to him, and have had my pardon ſealed from Heaven by the Bloud of my Saviour: I beg pardon of all whoſoever, whether I have offended them, or no: I truly forgive them, and have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought Almighty God to poure his bleſſings upon them. I accuſe no man. I find fault nor quarrell with no man, neither with the perſons that were the occaſions, they were but inſtruments; neither at the perſons condemning. I accept thankfully the Sentence of Death upon my ſelf, and I beſeech Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, that I may be the laſt that may ſuffer upon this ſcore, or upon any other.</p>

                  <p>If there be any thing wherein I can give any other ſatisfaction to any Chriſtian whatſoever, in any kind, as I ſpake in generall, I bleſs Almighty God from my own Heart, now ſo aſſiſted by the eſpeciall Operation, and Motions, and Dictates of the Holy Ghoſt: if I can know any thing, wherein, or how to be now in my dying (not having ſerved God ſo well in my life) ſerviceable to the Church of God, of Chriſt, and the full ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:51765:92"/>
of any whatſover, I am here ready: I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted, but in my extaſies to Heaven, there is that Glory I am going to. I beſeech Almighty God, that he will give me grace to bleſs his holy Name; as for all, as for Jeſus Chriſt, and in him all things, ſo particularly for this, that he hath thought me wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to bring me hither for my faithfulneſs to my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, that is the moſt pious and moſt juſt Prince in all the world. My Maſter hath ſuffered bitterly in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; and if there be any failing in his ſervice, the fault is onely mine. God knows, I have done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the buſineſs, but by the inſtance of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants; I delivered my Letters, and there they lie: To other things I am a Stranger. I hope that God will give me the grace of perſeverance in that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion; in that loyalty to my Prince; in that love to all the World, that now (being to give up my accompt to him, that) I may with comfort be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the arms of his mercy.</p>
                  <p>If there be any thing, Maſter Sheriff, that I may give ſatisfaction in, I am ready to do it according to the poor talent I have. I will receive my puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the way God hath prepared for me; and many ways I have been taken up. Truly I am bound to all that ſee me, and many thouſands more ſince I came into <hi>England,</hi> not an uncivil look (we had ſtrange reports abroad) not an uncivil look from any: God repay them all, and return them from the Throne of his Grace into their own Boſoms. And God in particular bleſs that Honourable Lady, who was the occaſion of the coming of my Lords Grace of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magh,</hi> with the Confirmation of thoſe glorious and eternal Meſſages of Comfort which now I am going to enjoy: being thankfull to all thoſe that know me, and know me not, for ſince I am come hither, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:51765:92"/>
I might have received prejudice in reſpect to my Loyalty (which is not the way, now) I have from them all received courteſie, the Lord repay them. I thank God I am otherwiſe bred, and my Allegiance hath been incorporated, imbodied into my Religion; and beſides the great deſires of other Gentlemen, that I might goe out of the World, but that the world might ſee that the Grace of God hath had a perfect Reformation in me, and a willing and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Submiſſion to his Will, therefore I repent me not of it; but I beſeech Almighty God to bleſs and proſper all people whatſoever that to this Kingdome belong. As my Speech is imperfect, ſo is my Health. I have forced my ſelf in this Diſcourſe to give that ſatisfaction which I could. And I beſeech you Mr. Sheriff, if you can hear of any Gentlemen that are wronged, what I offer here, I am to anſwer it; and I beſeech you joyn with me in your Chriſtian Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, that I may have a paſſage whither I am now going to give an account, not only of every deed, but of every word.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THe Earl of <hi>Derby</hi> (according to the order of the Court Marſhall held at <hi>Cheſter,</hi> by which he was ſentenced to die at <hi>Bolton</hi> in <hi>Lancaſhire</hi>) was brought to that Town with a guard of Horſe and Foot of Colonel <hi>Jones's,</hi> commanded by one <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> who received his order from Colonel <hi>Robert Duckenfield,</hi> betwixt 12. and 1. of the clock, on Wedneſday the 15. of <hi>October,</hi> the people weeping, praying, and bewailing him all the way from the priſon at <hi>Cheſter</hi> to the place of his death.</p>
               <p>He was brought to a houſe in the Town near the Croſſe, where the Scaffold was raiſed, and as he paſſed by ſaid, [<hi>VENIO DOMINE, I am prepared to fulfill thy will, O my God: this Scaffold muſt be my Croſſe; bleſſed Saviour, I take it up wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly and follow thee.</hi>] From thence going into a Chamber with ſome friends and ſervants, he was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertized by the Commander in Cheif, that he had till 3. of the clock allowed him to prepare for death; for indeed the Scaffold was not ready, the people of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:51765:94"/>
the Town and Country generally refuſing to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſo much as a planck, or ſtrike a naile, or to lend any aſſiſtance to that work, their cry being generally in the ſteerts, <hi>Oh ſad day, O wofull day! ſhall the good Earl of Derby dye here</hi>? many ſad loſſes have we had in this Warre, but none like unto this; for now the Antient Honour of our Countrey muſt ſuffer here: and adde to his trouble, moſt of the Timber that built the Scaffold, was of the ruines of <hi>Latham</hi> houſe; but nothing could alter his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips reſolution and courage: for with a ſtedfaſt compoſed countenance and a chearfull, he call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the company which were preſent to prayers with him; wherein he ſhewed admirable fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency, and a kind of humble importunity with Almighty God, that he would pardon his ſinnes, be mercifull to his ſoul, and be gracious to this land, in reſtoring the <hi>King, Laws</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi>; and that he would be a <hi>Husband</hi> to his <hi>Wife,</hi> a <hi>Father</hi> to his <hi>Children,</hi> and a <hi>Friend</hi> to all thoſe that ſuffered by his <hi>loſſe,</hi> or that had been friends to him.</p>
               <p>Riſing from prayer, he ſate down with a very pleaſing countenance, and aſſured the ſtanders by, that God had heard his prayers, which the bleſſed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God witneſſed unto him, in the preſent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts he now felt in his ſoul. Then he entred into a diſcourſe of his life, and beſeech't God to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give him the daies and time he had miſ-ſpent, and ſaid it was his Comfort, that although he had not walked ſo circumſpectly as he ought to have done, yet he ever had a ſenſe of his ſinnes, and a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der reſpect to all the Services, Servants and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of his God, and that he knew God had mercy for him, that he had ſtrengthened and comforted him againſt all the terrours of death.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:51765:94"/>After theſe and ſome other words to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, he deſired his friends and the people by to pray with him again; which when he had ended, riſing from him his knees, he appeared fully ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of a gracious Return to his prayers, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver after ſhewed any ſadneſſe in his countenance.</p>
               <p>His next buſineſſe was with his <hi>Sonne</hi> the Lord <hi>Strange,</hi> whom he publickly charged to be <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull</hi> to his <hi>ſad Mother, affectionate</hi> to his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed <hi>Brothers</hi> and <hi>Siſters,</hi> and <hi>ſtudious</hi> of the peace of his <hi>Country: But especially</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>Son, I charge you upon my bleſſing, and upon the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings you expect from God, to be ever dutifull to your diſtreſſed Mother, ever obedient to hers commands, and ever tender how you in any thing grieve or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend her: She is a perſon well known to the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent perſonages of</hi> England, France, Germany <hi>and</hi> Holland, <hi>noted for piety, prudence, and all honourable vertues, and certainly the more you are obedient to her, the more you will increaſe in favour with God and Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then he deſired to be private in the room him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; where he was obſerved to be about half an hour upon his knees with frequent interjections of groans and ſighs before his God: then when he called the company in again, his eyes witneſſed to us, that he had abundantly mixed <hi>tears</hi> with his <hi>prayers</hi>; he told us that he was very willing to leave the world, being aſſured by the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of Gods Spirit, that he ſhould be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried from trouble to reſt and peace, from ſorrow to joy, from life to death, and that death had no other bitterneſſe in it to him, but that it took him from his dear Wife and Children; whom he <hi>humbly</hi> commended to the protection and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:51765:95"/>
of a better <hi>Husband,</hi> and a better <hi>Father</hi>; and that yet he did not doubt, but that the Generall, and they who ſate in the ſeat of Authority, would make proviſion for them, hoping that his death might ſatisfie all thoſe who ſought his life, whom he freely forgave, and deſired God to doe the like. Then calling for his Sonne, he took his leave of him, and bleſſed him; which indeed would have grieved any ones heart (though never ſo hardned) to ſee the parting of him now with his Son, and with his two Daughters, the Lady <hi>Katharine,</hi> and the Lady <hi>Amely Stanley,</hi> upon the Road betwixt <hi>Cheſter</hi> and <hi>Bolton</hi> the day before.</p>
               <p>This ended, he called the Officer, and told him he was ready. In his way to the Scaffold, the people prayed and wept and cryed aloud, to whom his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with a cheerfull countenance and courteous humbleneſſe, ſaid, <hi>Good people, I thank you, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you ſtill pray for me, and our bleſſed God return your prayers back into your own boſomes; The God of Mercies bleſſe you, the Son of God eſtabliſh you in righteouſneſſe, and the Holy Ghoſt fill you with all comforts.</hi>— Coming neer the Scaffold, he look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up and ſaid, <hi>God I thank thee, I am not afraid to goe up here, though I am to die there; there are but theſe few ſteps to my eternity:</hi> then kiſſing the ladder, he went up, and ſaluted the people, he walked a turn or two upon the Scaffold, then went to the Eaſt-end of the Scaffold, and pulled off his hat again and ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the people with a cheerful countenance, ſaid,— I am come by the will of my heavenly Father to die in this place, and I thank God I doe with all willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and readineſſe ſubmit to his moſt bleſſed will.</p>
               <p>'Tis a place I deſired to ſee when I was laſt in the Country, both for the mutual obligations that have

As for my crime (as ſome are pleaſed to term it) which was objected againſt me, by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of war, (for <hi>Bootle</hi>'s death was never mentioned againſt me there, that being onely ſecretly uſed to raiſe a prejudice againſt me in the judgments of ſuch as did not know me) my crime (I ſay) though I hope it deſerves a farre better name, was, that I came into my own Country with my own lawfull King; I came in obedience to his Majeſties call, whom both by the laws of God, and the laws of this land, I conceived my ſelf obliged to obey, and according to the <hi>proteſtation</hi> I took in Parliament in the time of that bleſſed Prince his Father; ſo if it be my crime, I here confeſſe it again before God, Angels and men,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:51765:96"/>
                  <hi>that I love Monarchy as the beſt government,</hi> and, I die with Love and Honour: and for the Love and Honour I bear to my <hi>Maſter</hi> that now is, <hi>CHARLES,</hi> the ſecond of that name, <hi>whom I my ſelf in this Countrey proclaimed King</hi>; the Lord bleſſe and preſerve him, and incline the hearts of thoſe that have power in this Nation, to accept him to his Fathers Throne with Honour and Peace; for certainly as I believe, this Nation will never be well contented, never throughly happy without a King, ſo I believe alſo that King <hi>CHARLES</hi> the ſecond our now lawfull King, were he a ſtranger to this Crown, were the moſt fit, and moſt accompliſht Prince that this day lives, to take the government of this people; his admirable piety, vertue, juſtice, great valour and diſcretion, far above ſo few years, doth now make him in all places he comes highly beloved, and will hereafter make him honourable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all Nations, and I wiſh the people of this Nation ſo much happineſſe (when my eyes are cloſed) that he may peaceably be received to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of his juſt right, and then they ſhall never want their juſt rights, which till then, they will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways want.</p>
               <p>As for my being in armes in the beginning of this war, I profeſſe here in the preſence of my God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom within a few minutes I muſt make an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for this profeſſion, I onely fought for peace, and ſetling the late King my Maſter in his juſt rights, and the maintenance of the laws of this land, and that I had no other deſigne, intent or purpoſe for my then taking up armes: and for this laſt ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I profeſſe here again in the preſence of the ſame God, that I did it for the reſtoring of my law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Soveraign into that Throne, out of which his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was moſt unchriſtianly and barbarouſly taken, by
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:51765:96"/>
the moſt unjuſt ſentence of a pretended Court of Juſtice, and himſelf againſt law and all Juſtice kept out and diſpoſſeſt of; and this was all my reaſon. For as for eſtate or quality, I wanted not a ſufficient competency, neither was I ever ambitious to enlarge either: for by the favour of my King's Predeceſſors, my family was raiſed to a condition well known in this Country; and now it is as well known that by his enemies I am adjudged to die, and that by <hi>new and monſtrous laws,</hi> as making me an enemy to my Country, for fighting for my Country; as a Traitor to the laws, for endeavouring to preſerve the laws: But, <hi>Oh! God give me grace to conſider him who ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered ſuch contradictions of ſinners, and O my God aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert the King to his Fathers Throne, aſſert the laws to their former honour, and reſtore thy own religion in its purity, that all theſe ſhadows and falſe pretences of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion may vaniſh away, and our childrens poſterities may ſerve thee in ſpirit and in truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Good friends, I die for the <note n="*" place="margin">At which word, <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Laws,</hi> a Trooper ſaid aloud, we will neither have King, Lord, nor Laws; and upon a ſudden the ſouldiers being either ſurprized with fear at a ſtrange noiſe that was heard, or elſe falling into mutiny, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently fell into a tumult, riding up and down the ſtreets, cutting and ſlaſhing the people, ſome being killed and many wounded; his Lordſhip looking upon this ſad spectacle, ſaid thus, Gentlemen it troubles me more then my own death, that others are hurt, and (I fear) die for me; I beſeech you ſtay your hands, I flie not, you purſue not me, and here are none to purſue you. But being inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted in his speech, and not permitted to go on further, (for which the Officers were much troubled) he turn'd aſide to his ſervant, and gave him the ſpeech into his hand, ſaying, I will speak to my God, who I know will hear me, and when I am dead, let the world know what I would have ſaid.

I leave nothing behind me which I much care for, but my King, my Wife, Children and Friends, whom (I truſt) the never-failing mercies of my God will provide for: I beſeech God ſhew mercy to thoſe, who neither had mercy nor juſtice for me: my bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour taught me by his example and command, both to pray for my enemies, and to ſo give my ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; I forgive them freely, even thoſe that contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved my ruine, and purſued me to death; I thank God, I never perſonally offended them to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in my life; and let me not offend againſt them at my death: I forgive them freely, and pray God for Chriſts ſake to forgive them alſo.</p>
               <p>Of my Faith and Religion I ſhall not (I hope) need to ſay much, herein I hope my enemies (if now I have any) will ſpeak for me.

                  <hi>This</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>will be troubleſome to thee; I pray thee put it off and do it as willingly as I put off this garment of my fleſh, that is now ſo heavy for my ſoul:</hi> then ſome of the ſtanders by bid the Heads-man kneel and ask his Lordſhip pardon; but he did not, but was ſurly and crabbed: but his <hi>Lordſhip</hi> ſaid, <hi>Friend, I give thee the pardon thou wilt not aske, and God forgive thee alſo</hi>: Then turning up his eyes to heaven, ſaid aloud, <hi>How long Lord? how long</hi>? then gently paſſing over the <hi>Scaffold,</hi> and ſeeing one of his <hi>Chaplains</hi> on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back among the people, <hi>Good Sir</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>pray for me, and the Lord return your prayers into your own boſom, and I pray remember me kindly to your brother, and God remember him for his love to me and mine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then turning towards his <hi>Coffin, Thou art</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>my bridall Chamber, in thee I ſhall reſt without a guard, and ſleep without Souldiers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then looking towards the block, he asked if all were ready, <hi>That</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>methinks is very low, and yet there is but one step betwixt that and heaven</hi>; then turning his eyes to the people, he ſaluted them and deſired again their prayers; then ſaid, <hi>I ſee your tears, and hear your ſighs and groans and prayers: the God of Heaven hear and grant your ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications for me, and mine for you, and the Mediation of Chriſt Jeſus for us all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here his Lordſhip cauſed the block to be turned, that he might look upon the Church, ſaying, <hi>Whilſt I am here, I will look towards thy holy Sanctuary, and I know that within a few minutes, I ſhall behold thee my God and King in thy Sanctuary above, under the ſhadow of thy wings ſhall be my reſt till this calamity be over-paſt</hi>; then he pulled off his <hi>blew</hi> garter and ſent it to his Son, and pulling off his doublet, with a very religious chearfulneſs he ſaid, <hi>I come, Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:51765:98"/>
and O come thou quickly, that I may be with thee for ever</hi>: upon this he ſaid, <hi>Pray tell me how muſt I lye, I have been called a bloudy man, yet truly I never yet had that ſevere curioſity to ſee any man put to death in peace</hi>; then laying himſelf down on the block, after a few minutes he roſe again, and cauſed the block to be a little removed; then ſaid to the Heads-man, <hi>Friend, remember what I ſaid to thee, and be no more afraid to ſtrike then I to dye</hi>; and <hi>when I put up my hand do thy work</hi>; ſo looking round about upon his friends and the people, he ſaid, <hi>The Lord bleſſe you all, and once more pray for me and with me</hi>; at which words he kneeled down and prayed privately with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himſelf, with great ſighings, about half a quarter of an hour, concluding with the Lords prayer; then ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing up again, he ſaid (ſmilingly) <hi>My ſoul is now at reſt, and ſo ſhall my body be immediately. The Lord bleſs my King, and reſtore him to his rights in this Kingdom, and the Lord bleſs this Kingdom, and reſtore them to their rights in their King, that he and they may joyn hand in hand to ſettle truth and peace; and the Lord bleſs this County, and this Town, and this People. The Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort my ſad wife and children and reward all my friends with peace and happineſs, both here and hereafter, and the Lord forgive them who were the cauſe and authors of this my ſad end and unjuſt death, for ſo it is as to mankind; though before God I deſerve much worſe, but I hope my ſins are all bathed in the bloud of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> So laying his neck upon the block, and his armes ſtretcht out, he ſaid theſe words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bleſſed be Gods glorius name for ever and ever. Let the whole earth be filled with his glory. Amen, Amen.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:51765:99"/>At which words, he gave the Heads-man the ſigne; but he either not obſerving it, or not being ready ſtayed too long, ſo that his Lordſhip roſe up again, ſaying, Why doe you keep me from my Saviour? what have I done, that I die not, and that I may live with him? Once more I will lay down my ſelf in peace, and ſo take my everlaſting reſt. Then ſaying, Come Lord Jeſus, come quickly, he ſtretched out his armes, and gave the ſigne, repeating the ſame words:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bleſſed be Gods glorious name for ever and ever. Let the whole earth be filled with his glory. Amen, Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then lifting up his hand, the Executioner did his work at one blow, all the people weeping and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and giving all expreſſions of grief and lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>When the corps was carried off the Scaffold, they carried them to a houſe in the Town, where was thrown into his coffin in a peice of paper theſe two lines.</p>

               <p>IT was thought needleſs by the friends of Mr. <hi>Gerhard</hi> to declare any thing concerning his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings to the world more then in their ſighs, had not the ſacrilegious malice of the laſt weekly-pamph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let thrown ſome ſtains upon his name, and ſo incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them to a vindication as pious as his death was. 'Tis moſt certain that there can no blots ſtick upon

true honour, which ſuch weak fellowes endeavour againſt it: Theſe are curſed beaſts but their horns are ſhort; ſepulchral dogs! that ſcrape up graves, and violate the dead, and are fierce and ravenous, but yet dogs ſtill.

Yet becauſe every under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is not of the ſame brightneſs, and thoſe putrid libels may by ill chance fall into ſome inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent hand hereafter (and yet ſure ſuch vermin ſhould not be endured long) therefore let wiſe and good men pardon him that hath undertaken this juſtice for that Gentleman, and be pleaſed to read this ſad ſtory, not for their ſatisfaction ſake, but their ſorrows: It may dry up a friendly tear perhaps, and ſtill a murmuring groan to ſee the comly poſture of his paſſion, how well all was carried by him, and how honourably, and the honeſt circumſtances may not improbably take off from the ſadneſſe. Why ſhould I grieve that death which had ſuch a living glory in it? Or diſhonour that bloud with feeble tears, which was ſhed ſo like the holy Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs? All that knew this perſon cannot but wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe his generall reſolution, and whether his great courage fell leſs then it ſelf (as that viper hiſſeth) or did not rather riſe greater now, when the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian was twiſted with the Gentleman, let this faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full relation witneſs.

               <p>From the firſt day of his impriſonment he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw the heavy ſentence hovering upon him, and
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:51765:100"/>
therefore gave all diligence to ſecure himſelf againſt it; that however he underwent a temporal condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, he might eſcape an eternal. But after that ſad himſelf doom was pronounced, then he beſtirred amain, and made double haſt for heaven, It was for his life, and therefore he would loſe no minute, but the ſame night gave directions to a dear friend for a Miniſter (whom he knew to have long honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his family) to be brought to him early next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and it pleaſed Authority to gratifie him in this great deſire, ſo that an order was ſent freely for the quiet admiſſion of any ſuch perſon to him. With this ſpiritual friend he ſpent ſome hours every day in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, &amp; other ghoſtly refreſhments, which (God be prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed) were not without ſweet effect and impreſſions upon his ſoul.<note place="margin">M. <hi>Bond.</hi> M. <hi>Caryl.</hi>
                  </note> There were ſome other Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of great obſervation for gravity and godlineſſe in theſe times, who viſited him, and who I am confident will put their ſeal to this truth with me, that they found him meek, humble, modeſt, penitent, comforted, and not far from the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, if not already in it: but I have good hope he was in poſſeſſion, and ſo had he, through grace. Upon the morning (which was the laſt he muſt ſee untill that of the Reſurrection) he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to ſome wholſome orders of the Church, and received her comforts by them. That done, he proceeded to (the higheſt enjoyment of grace that can be adminiſtred upon earth) the holy Communion, whereof with his brother Sir <hi>Gilbert Gerard</hi> he was a partaker, with as much reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, zeal, thankfulneſs, holy ſorrows, and holy joys, as a devout ſoul could evidence. He wept as if he would have waſhed his Saviours wounds, which his faith preſented in his tears; and yet he ſaid
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:51765:101"/>
he was admirably raviſhed with all inward peace and comfort in his own conſcience. This paſſed, he had now nothing to doe but to die, which he expected that morning very ſpeedily; But by the pleaſure of Authority, both the time and the place of his exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution was altered, ſo that he was to wait a little longer, untill evening, for his releaſe. Many friends and perſons of Honour came to take their laſt leave of him, who can gladly witneſs his undiſturbedneſs and civil cheerfulneſs to every one of them. His brother tarryed continually with him, and they are together; and though ſome eruptions of paſſion could not be reſtrained now and then where nature was ſo much concerned, yet they were generally plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, &amp; at laſt parted (about half an hour before he was led forth to death) with as much calmneſs and placid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as if they had been to meet again anon ſafe and unhurt as they had done formerly. So have I ſeen a windy and ſtormy day conclude in ſtilneſs and Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine, as if weary and deſiring to reſt without any breath of trouble, The Miniſter only waiting on him to the laſt; and about five a clock enters the Lieut. of the Tower, and the Sheriffe of <hi>London</hi>; Two ſure friends, that will not leave him as long as he hath life remaining in him: They told him a ſowr meſſage, that they were come to conduct him to his death's blow: He reply'd they were very welcome, and received them ſo fearleſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troubled, that the Sheriffe told the Miniſter, <hi>He was ſorry to ſee him ſo unfit for that condition</hi>; but (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der favour) he miſtook his condition, That which he accounted fitneſs to die, our Pamphlet-monger would have called flagging and cowardiſe. So hard a thing it is to ſatisfie all curioſities, even with our blood, and nothing more ingenious then to carry this
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:51765:101"/>
bitter cup even, when ſo many miſconſtructions ſhake it. At his lodging he deſired the Sheriffe that he would permit the Miniſter and three others that were his friends and ſervants to goe upon the Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold with him; which as it was a ſeaſonable wiſdome in him to deſire, ſo was it a fortunate kindneſs from them that granted it, elſe it may be their teſtimony might have been wanting to his injured reputation. He took leave particularly of the houſhold where he was a priſoner, and was ſo clearly collected in every thing he did, that he went out of his way into the kitchin to bid his Landlady farewell, giving thanks for her reſpects during his bonds, which he ſaid he ſhould die in to her. As he paſſed by the Guards in the Tower, he gave them money twice, and told them, he ſhould trouble them no longer, being on his remove to better guards. He walked along to the Scaffold on Tower-hill, ſhewing a great deal both of humility and reſpect to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who generally lamented him, and prayed for him. As he went he was bare-headed for the moſt part, carrying his hat in his hand, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times reſting it in a careleſs bravery on his left ſide. When he came to (or rather leap'd upon the Scaffold (for he was ſo far from flagging when to tread that Tragical Stage, that many obſerv'd how ſprightfully he ſeem'd to skip up the ſteps to it, as if he had gone to dance there rather then to die) his grim executioner preſented himſelf to him, to whom with a cheerful ſmile he ſaid, <hi>Welcome honeſt friend</hi>; And deſiring to ſee his Ax, he took it into his hands, and kiſſing it, with a pretty glance of his eye (which was a natural lovelineſs in him) towards the Miniſter, he ſaid, <hi>This will doe the Deed I war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant it.</hi> The Scaffold was very much crowded with
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:51765:102"/>
people, yet as well as he could he made ſome turns to and fro upon it, with a paper (which he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of his pocket) in his hand, wherein it ſeems he had prepared ſome heads of a ſpeech which he intended to have delivered; but the Sheriff and Lieuteant told him, if he ſpoke any thing, it muſt be very brief, and that they muſt not ſuffer him to ſpeak any thing that was ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious; <hi>Well Gentlemen</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>your will be done; but (God be praiſed) I never yet had to do with any thing that was ſeditious! I would fain have spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſomething to clear my ſelf to the world, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the cuſtom, if it might have been: But come Sir,</hi> ſaith he, turning to the Miniſter, <hi>Let you and I speake to him that will give us leave</hi>: and ſo kneeling down together in a corner of the ſtage, the Miniſter pray'd with him a ſhort time, which done, they ſtood up again. Then turning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the people, and putting off his hat, he told them, <hi>That he was not permitted to ſpeak a few words according to his intention, yet he doubted not but what he would have ſaid would come to their eyes, though it muſt not come to their ears: But this I deſire all to take notice of,</hi> and this he ſpoke (with a double ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemence) <hi>that I dye a faithfull ſubject and ſervant to King</hi> Charles <hi>the ſecond, whom I pray God to bleſs, and restore to his Rights; and had I ten thouſand thouſand lives, I would gladly lay them all down thus for his ſervice.</hi> Here he was interrupted, and the Sheriff wiſhed him rather to confeſſe what he knew concerning the horrid plot he was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for; He anſwered, <hi>That he had confeſſed all that he knew concerning any Plot: that he thought they knew more of the Plot that condemn'd him, then he did; but he heartily forgave them.</hi> The Miniſter told
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:51765:102"/>
him it was well done to forgive and pardon thoſe that perſecute us: That was an act of true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an love, but as his caſe ſtood, love was not enough; He ought to deal in this buſineſs (upon which his life lay) with all candour and ſincerity, not concealing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing of that nature as was charged againſt him, as far as he might glorifie God and ſerve the publick good. Upon which, lifting up his eyes towards hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and laying his hand upon his breaſt, <hi>Oh Sir,</hi> ſays he, <hi>if there had been any ſuch thing in this breaſt, would I not have revealed it before this time! I proteſt in the ſight of Almighty God, I know no more of any ſuch deſign, but onely what I have often acknowledged, that it was motioned to me by</hi> Henſhaw, <hi>(who I confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe is in their hands) and debated twice or thrice when I was with him: but I never entertained it at all, and at the laſt flatly diſown'd it, and told him I would have nothing to do in it. He was many times preſſing me to nominate what perſons I knew I could bring, and to have their names; but let them ſhew any ſuch thing if they can against me. But I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain he is in their hands.</hi> Pawſing here a little, and fetching a turn or two on the Scaffold, being very hot (as he had been all that morning) he call'd for ſome ſmall beer, which he had given order to be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and was brought thither in a ſtone bottle, of which he drank a little once or twice. Then the Miniſter went to him, and minded him that ſomething might be expected from him as to his Religion, and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to dye. To which gathering up an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reſolution in his face he replyed, <hi>I dye a Christian, a true Chriſtian, according to that Faith and Religion, which was profeſſed by the Church of</hi> Engl. <hi>in the time of our late King of bleſſed memory. And I praiſe God I am ſo fitted and ready to dye, that I am confident by
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:51765:103"/>
the merits of Chriſt Jeſus, that my ſins are pardoned, and my ſalvation is at hand.</hi> Then turning about he called for his waſt-coat and cap, and throwing off his doublet put them on, whilſt his ſervants helped to put up his hair. His waſt-coat was not very clean, which he took notice of to his man: <hi>but 'tis no great matter ſaid he, if the heart be clean all's well enough.</hi> Being thus prepar'd, he calls for the Block: and viewing it (as with delight) laid himſelf down upon it, to ſee how it would fit, and was ſo far from ſinking at the ſight of it, that he almoſt play'd with it: and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing quickly pulls a little paper-book out of his poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, which he gave to the Miniſter, willing him to find that particular Prayer which was proper for that occaſion, but the crowd being great, he could not quickly find it, ſo that he kneeled down with the book open a while in his hand as if he had read; but quickly ſhut it, and prayed with great expreſſions of fervency by himſelf. When he had done, the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſaid ſomething to him (as it ſeesm) concerning his Brother <hi>Charls</hi> that had witneſſed againſt him; I know not what the Lieutenant ſaid, (for he ſpake low) but Mr. <hi>Gerard</hi> ſpake aloud, and replyed paſſionately, <hi>O Christ Sir! I love my poor brother with all my heart! he is but a youth and was terrified, I know how he was dealt with; tell him I love him as well as ever I lov'd him in my life. And commend me to my brother Sir</hi> Gilbert, <hi>whoſe releaſe I beſeech you Sir to aſſist: there being no more cauſe, that I know of for his impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then onely that he was found in the ſame bed with me, which ſure is no capital crime.</hi> Having ſaid this, he took his leave with him, and the Sheriff, and all he knew on the Stage: and turning about once more to the people, deſired them to pray for him, himſelf kneeling down with the Miniſter, laid his hand in his
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:51765:103"/>
boſom, and they prayed together the laſt time. After this he bids them all farewel again, <hi>and beſought them to remember they had a poor Soveraign abroad who deſerved to be remembred.</hi> Then forgiving the Executioner, and ſaluting the Miniſter with his laſt embrace and kiſſes, he bow'd himſelf to the ſtroak of death, with as much Chriſtian meekneſs and noble courage mix'd together, as I believe was ever ſeen in any that had bled upon that Altar. And this all the people that were Spectators, did ſeem to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and acknowledge: beholding his fatal blow with an univerſal ſadneſs and ſilence; whereas, when the other Gentleman fell quickly after upon another ſcore of bloud and ryot, they gave a great and generall ſhout, as applauding the Juſtice of the <hi>Portugals</hi> death; but pittying and bewailing the untimely fall of ſo brave and magnanimous a ſpirit, as did (through all the clouds of death) ſhine glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly in this unfortunate Gentleman.</p>

                  <p>My days have been few and evil, yet God be bleſſed in all the vanities and folly of youth, I have been far from Atheiſm, or contempt of Gods worſhip; <hi>I</hi> had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies awful impreſſions of Gods honour and ſervice; which is now my comfort.</p>

               <p>AT this earthly Bar from them that pretend to have a great meaſure of ſanctity, I had hard meaſure; but to that Bar I am now going, the Bar of heaven, I ſhall have Juſtice, yea one day Juſtice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, except they water their beds and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches with tears of Repentance.</p>
               <p>The Court gave ſevere and raſh Judgement on my body, and ſent a pitifull fellow (but a pitileſs fellow) that gave as raſh a Judgement of my ſoul; but that precious Jewel none of them could touch to hurt.</p>
               <p>The Souls under the Altar cry loud for vengeance long ago; how many more of late years have been added to them to help the cry? the cry is loud of thoſe lately whoſe blood hath been unlawfully ſpilt; but vengeance is Gods, and I will leave it to him.</p>
               <p>The Court of my Tryal ſaid I was confident, and held it as a fault; He alſo whom they ſent to
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:51765:105"/>

               <p>Gentlemen Souldiers, Among the ancient and ſavage ſort of Heathen, they had a Law once every three, ſix, or twelve moneths to offer up a ſacrifice of humane blood to their God; and that their God was a Divel: Among us, whether heathen or not you beſt know, of late years we have had a fatal cuſtome, once in three, ſix, or twelve moneths to make not only a ſacrifice, but many ſacrifices of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Chriſtian blood, our Scaffolds have reek'd and ſmok'd with the choiſeſt ſort of blood. But unto what God do you judge? What God is he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in the blood of man? <hi>Baal,</hi> the god of Ekron, <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> the god of Flyes.</p>
               <p>Amongſt the Primitive Chriſtians that lived neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt the time of our Saviour Chriſt, the greateſt Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants and perſecutors of the Chriſtians lived; the perſecution was great, and yet the courage of thoſe perſecuted Chriſtians was ſo great, that it excelled the fury of the perſecutors; that they came in faſter to be kill'd, then they could kill; they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered their bodies and throats ſo thick unto the ſlaughter, that the hands of the Tyrants were weary with killing; and yet <hi>Sanguis Martirum,</hi> was <hi>Semen Eccleſiae,</hi> and many Heathens came in with the Chriſtians, ſeeing their cheerful conſtancy, rurned Chriſtians, and dyed Chriſtians, and dyed with them; the Chriſtians ſtill encreaſed the more.</p>
               <p>Of late years here hath been a great perſecution in
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:51765:106"/>
this Nation, and yet the ſufferers have been ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and preſent themſelves ſo thick in the vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their King, Country, and Laws, that they ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the very enemy himſelf; their conſtancy ſo great, that the eyes of their Judges dropped tears, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther real or true, let the Judge of Judges judge; They ſtill ſtand amazed at their conſtancy, though they exceed the old Heathens; Are not weary of killing.</p>
               <p>Oh Souldiers! How many of you have been brought up, and led on by blind Principles, wronged in your Education, or ſeduced by your indiſcreet heedleſs and heady Teachers? How many of you young men have for ſome ſmall diſcontent departed from your loving Maſters, dear Friends, or tender Parents, and fled into the Army? How many of you driven by Tyranous oppreſſion, poverty, or cruelty, have left your dear wives and children? And ſome for novelty or wantonneſs adhere to this imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not conſidering the great danger of ſpilling innocent bloud.</p>
               <p>How many of you have drawn your Swords you do not know for what? How many of you keep drawn your ſwords, you do not know for what? You have put to death a pious and juſt King, and in his ſtead have reared up even another <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> that makes <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ſin: What his goodneſs is, you beſt know: You have put down a good old Law, and reared up another of your own to judge the people by; my calling for the benefit of the former, and for the equity even of your own Law, I am in parr con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned here to dye. Be you Judge of the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
               <p>How many of you have had a hand in putting down the ancient true Church, and raiſed up in your
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:51765:106"/>
own imaginations a new one? But alas! You know not what you do; if you did, you would grieve to ſee what a glorious Church you have ruined: you would never have pulled down the hedges, and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken down the ſenſes, that the wild beaſts of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt ſhould come in, that the little foxes ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; and the wilde Boar ſhould rout out ſo ſtately a Vine.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Jewes</hi> were led into captivity, their goodly and magnificent Temple was burnt; but in proceſſe of time, they obtained favour amongſt the Heathen Kings they dwelt amongſt, and had liberty therewith to rebuild: rebuild they did, and finiſhed a ſecond Temple, at which ſight all the young men rejoyced to ſee ſo gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant a Temple, but the old men wept to ſee how farre different and ſhort the ſecond Temple was from the glory of the firſt: So you young men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce at your imaginary Church, but the old men methinks I ſee ſome weep, (Oh weep not for me) weep for your Country, weep to ſee Religion, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Laws taken from you, weep to ſee ſo many good men ſnatcht away, but indeed from the miſeries to come, and weep for what your unhappy ſelves will ſuffer.</p>
               <p>Souldiers, however you flouriſh for a time, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps many of you may reioyce at our deaths, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, as <hi>Sampſon</hi> pull'd the houſe of the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> down when he fell: ſo ſhall we give you and your Cauſe a greater blow by our deaths, than living we poſſibly could have done.

How will you anſwer all your Rapes and Murthers?

               <p>
                  <hi>Gentlemen,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT hath ever been the cuſtom of all perſons what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever when they come to die, to give ſome ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to the world, whether they be guilty of the fact of which they ſtand charged. The crime for
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:51765:108"/>
which they ſtand charged. The crime for which I am now to die, is Loyalty, (but) in this age call'd high Treaſon. I cannot deny but I was at <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moulton</hi> in this County: but whether my being there, or my actions there amount to ſo high a crime as high Treaſon, I leave to the world and to the Law to judg. Truly, if I were conſcious to my ſelf of any baſe ends that I had in this undertaking, I would not be ſo in jurious to my own ſoul, or diſingenuous to you, as not to make a publick acknowledgement thereof. I ſuppoſe that divers perſons, according as they are biaſſed in their ſeverall intereſts and relations, give their opinions to the world concerning us. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it impoſſible therefore ſo to expreſſe my ſelf in this particular, as not to expoſe both my judgement and reputation to the cenſure of many which I ſhall leave behind me. Becauſe I will not put others (therefore) upon a breach of charity concerning me or my actions, I have thought fit to decline all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes which may give them a capacity either to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure themſelves or me. My Tryall was publick, and my ſeverall examinations (I believe) will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced when I am in my grave: I will refer you therefore to the firſt, which I am ſure ſome of you heard, and to the later, which many of you (in good time) may ſee. Had Captain <hi>Crook</hi> done himſelf and us that right which a Gentleman and a Souldier ought to have done, I had not now been here. The man I forgive with all my heart: but truly Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, his proteſting againſt thoſe Articles he himſelf with ſo many proteſtations and importunities put upon us hath drawn ſo much diſhonour and bloud upon his head, that I fear ſome heavy judgement will purſue him. Though he hath been falſe to us, I pray God I do not prove a true prophet to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:51765:108"/>Nay, I muſt ſay more, that coming on the road to <hi>Exon,</hi> he the ſaid Captain <hi>Crook</hi> told me, Sir <hi>Joſeph Wagſtaffe</hi> was a gallant Gentleman, and that he was ſorry he was not taken with us; that then he might have had the benefit of our Articles: but now (ſaid he) I have beſet all the Country for him, ſo that he cannot eſcape, but muſt be hanged.</p>
               <p>He alſo queſtioned me as I paſſed through <hi>Salis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> from <hi>London,</hi> whether he had given me condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Which I endeavouring to make appear to Major <hi>Butler</hi>; he interrupted me, and unwillingly confeſs't it, ſaying, I profered him four hundred pounds to perform his Articles: which had been a ſtrange profer of mine, had I not really conditioned with him. And I told him then (having found him unworthy) I would have given him five hundred pounds, believing him to be mercenary. To make it yet farther appear, I injure him not by ſtyling him unworthy, after theſe Articles were given, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to piſtoll me, if I did not perſwade another houſe to yield, which then were boldly reſiſting. To which my ſervant <hi>John Biby</hi> (now a priſoner) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed; I hope you will not be ſo unworthy, as to break the Law of Arms.</p>
               <p>Thus much I am obliged to ſay to the honour of the Soulderie, that they have been ſo far from breaking any Articles given to others, that they have rather bettered them then other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
               <p>It is now our misfortune to be made preſidents and examples together: but I will not doe the Protectour ſo much injury, as to load him with this diſhonour; ſince I have been informed, that he would have made our conditions good, if
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:51765:109"/>
                  <hi>Crook,</hi> that gave them, had not abjur'd them.</p>
               <p>This is not a time for me to enlarge upon any ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, ſince I am now become the Subject of death: But ſince the Articles were drawn by my hand, I thought my ſelf obliged to a particular Juſtification of them.</p>
               <p>I could tell you of ſome ſouldiers which are turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of his troup for defending thoſe conditions of ours: but let that paſſe; and henceſo ward, in ſtead of life, liberty, and eſtate, (which were the Articles agreed upon) let drawing, hanging and quartering, bear the Denomination of Captain <hi>Crooks</hi> Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</p>
               <p>However, I thank the Protectour for granting me this honourable Death.</p>
               <p>I ſhould now give you an account of my Faith. But truly gentlemen this poor Nation is rent into ſo many ſeverall opinions, that it is impoſſible for me to give you mine without diſpleaſing ſome of you. However, if any man be ſo criticall as to enquire of what faith I die, I ſhall refer him to the Apoſtles, <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> and the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed, and to the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of this Reverend gentleman D. <hi>Short,</hi> to whom I have unboſomed my ſelf: and if this doe not ſatisfie, look in the thirty nine Articles of the Catholick Church of <hi>England</hi>; to them I have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, and do own them as authentick.</p>
               <p>Having now given you an accompt concerning my ſelf; I hold my ſelf obliged in duty to ſome of my friends, to take off a ſuſpition which lyes upon them: I mean, as to ſome perſons of Honour, which upon my examination I was charged to have held correſpondency with. The Marqueſſe of <hi>Hartford,</hi> the Marqueſſe of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> and my Lord of <hi>Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook</hi> were the perſons nominated to me. I did then
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:51765:109"/>
acquit them, and do now ſecond it with this prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation, That I never held any correſpondency with either or any of them, in relation to this particular buſineſſe, or indeed to any thing which concern'd the Protectour or his Government. As for the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> I ſaw him ſome twelve years ſince, and not later; and if I ſhould ſee him here preſent, I believe I ſhould not know him. And for the Earl of <hi>Pembrook,</hi> he was not a man likely, to whom I ſhould diſcover my thoughts, becauſe he is a man of a contrary judgement.</p>
               <p>I was examined likewiſe concening my Brother <hi>Freke,</hi> my Couſin <hi>Haſtings,</hi> Mr. <hi>Dorrington</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. It is probable their eſtates may make them liable to this my condition: but I doe here ſo far acquit them, as to give the world this farther proteſtation; that I am confident they are as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent in this buſineſſe as the youngeſt child here.</p>
               <p>I have no more to ſay to you now, but to let you know, that I am in charity with all men; I thank God, I both can, and doe forgive my greateſt perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors, and all that ever had any hand in my death.</p>
               <p>I have offered the Protectour as good ſecurity for my future demeanour as I ſuppoſe he could have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected: if he had thought ſit to have given me my life, certainly I ſhould not have been ſo ungratefull as to have imployed it againſt him. I do humbly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to Gods pleaſure, knowing that the iſſues of life and death are in his hand. My bloud is but a ſmall ſacrifice: if it had been ſaved, I am ſo much a Gent. as to have given thanks to him that preſerved it; and ſo much a Chriſtian, as to forgive them which take it. But ſeeing God by his providence hath called me to lay it down, I willingly ſubmit to it, though terrible to nature: but bleſſed be my Saviour,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:51765:110"/>
who hath taken out the ſting; ſo that I look upon it without terrour. Death is a debt, and a due debt; and it hath pleaſed God to make me ſo good a huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, that I am come to pay it before it is due. I am not aſhamed of the cauſe for which I die, but rather rejoyce that I am thought worthy to ſuffer in the defence and cauſe of Gods true Church, my law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful King, the liberty of the Subject, and Priviledge of Parliaments. Therefore I hope none of my alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and friends will be aſhamed of it; it is ſo far from pulling down my Family, that I look upon it as the raiſing of it one ſtory higher. Neither was I ſo prodigal of nature as to throw away my life, but have uſed (though none but honourable and honeſt) means to preſerve it.</p>
               <p>Theſe unhappy times indeed have been very fatall to my family: two of my Brothers already ſlain, and my ſelf going to the ſlaughter: it is Gods will and I humbly ſubmit to that providence.</p>
               <p>I muſt render an acknowledgment of the great civilities that I have received from this City of <hi>Exon,</hi> and ſome perſons of quality, and for their plentifull proviſion made for the priſoners. I thank Mr. Sheriff for his favour towards us, in particular to my ſelf; and I deſire him to preſent my due reſpects to the Protectour, and though he had no mercy for my ſelf, yet that he would have reſpect to my family.</p>
               <p>I am now ſtripping off my cloaths to fight a duell with death, (I conceive no other duell lawful) but my Saviour hath pulled out the ſting of this mine enemy, by making himſelf a ſacrifice for me: And truly I do not think that man deſerving one drop of his bloud, that will not ſpend all for him in ſo good a cauſe.</p>
               <p>The Truth is, Gentlemen, in this Age, Treaſon is
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:51765:110"/>
an <hi>individuum vagum,</hi> like the wind in the Goſpel, it bloweth where it liſteth: So now Treaſon is what they pleaſe, and lighteth upon whom they will. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed no man, except he will be a Traitour, can avoid this Cenſure of Treaſon. I know not to what end it may come, but I pray God my own, and my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers bloud that is now to die with me, may be the laſt upon this ſcore.</p>
               <p>Now Gentlemen, you may ſee what a condition you are in without a King: you have no Law to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect you, no rule to walk by when you perform your duty to God, your King and Country, you diſpleaſe the Arbitrary power now ſet up: (I cannot call it go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.) I ſhall leave you peruſe my Tryal, and there you ſhall ſee, what a condition this poor Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is brought into; and (no queſtion) will be utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtroyed, if not reſtored (by Loyal Subjects) to its old and glorious Government, I pray God he lay not his Judgements upon <hi>England</hi> for their ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſhneſſe in doing their duty, and readineſſe to put their hands in their boſoms, or rather taking part with the Enemy of Truth. The Lord open their eyes, that they may be no longer lead, or drawn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch ſnares: elſe the Child unborn will curſe the day of their Parents birth.</p>
               <p>God Almighty preſerve my Lawful King <hi>Charles</hi> the ſecond, from the hands of his Enemies, and break down that wall of Pride and Rebellion, which ſo long hath kept him from his juſt Rights. God preſerve his Royal Mother, and all his Majeſties Royal Brethren, and incline their hearts to ſeek after him. God incline the hearts of all true <hi>Engliſh</hi> men to ſtand up as one Man to bring in the King; and Redeem themſelves and this poor Kingdom, out of its more then <hi>Egyptian</hi> ſlavery.</p>

               <p>Then he kneeled down and kiſſed the block, and ſaid thus: I commit my ſoul to God my Creator and Redeemer. Look on me, O Lord, at my laſt gaſping: Hear my prayer and the prayers of all good people. I thank thee, O God, for all thy diſpenſations to wards me.</p>
               <p>Then kneeling down he prayed moſt devoutly, as followeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O Eternall, Almighty, and moſt mercifull God, the Righteous Judge of all the world, look down in mercy on me a miſerable ſinner. O bleſſed Jeſus Redeemer of Mankind, which takeſt away the ſinnes of the world, let thy perfect manner of obedience be preſented to thy Heavenly Father for me. Let thy precious death and bloud be the ranſome and ſatisfaction of my many and haynous tranſgreſſions. Thou that ſitteſt at the right hand of God, make interceſſion for me. O holy and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Spirit which are the comforter, fill my heart with thy conſolations.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O Lord conſider my condition, accept my tears, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwage my grief, give comfort and confidence in thee: impute not unto me my former ſinnes, but moſt merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Father receive me into thy favour, for the merits of Christ Jeſus. Many and grievous are my ſins, for
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:51765:111"/>
I have ſinned many times againſt the light of knowledg, against remorſe of conſcience, againſt the motions and opportunities of grace. But accept I beſeech thee, the ſacrifice of a broken and contrite heart, in and for the perfect ſacrifice, oblation, and ſatisfaction of thy Son Jeſus Chriſt. O Lord receive my ſoul after it is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the burthen of the fleſh, into perfect-joy in the ſight and fruition of thee. And at the generall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection grant that my body may be endowed with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, and received with my ſoul into glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I praiſe thee O God, I acknowledge thee to be the Lord. O Lamb of God, that takeſt away the ſinnes of the world, have mercy on me.

With the ſubſtance of his <hi>ſpeech</hi> before his Death.</head>
               <p>ABout Eleven of the clock Sir <hi>Henry Slingsby</hi> was brought from the Tower to the Scaffold on Tower-Hill; whither being come, he fell upon his knees, and for a ſhort ſpace prayed privately.</p>
               <p>Then ſtanding up, he did in a ſhort Speech, and with a very low voice, addreſs himſelf to that noble Gentleman Mr. Sheriff <hi>Robinſon,</hi> telling him that what he had to ſay he would ſpeak to him; which was to this purpoſe:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That he had received a Sentence to die, upon account of his endevouring to betray the Garriſon of</hi> Hull: <hi>But ſaid, All that he did in that buſineſs he was drawn into by others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the Officers of that Garriſon did believe he had ſome greater Deſign in hand, and therefore they would needs pump him to the bottome: But what he spoke to them in private was brought into evidence againſt him: He likewiſe ſaid, That he did no more than any perſon would have done that was ſo brought on.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That he had made many applications (by his Friends) for a Reprieve, but found his Highneſs was inexora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He did confeſs that he did deliver a Commiſſion (as

it was charged againſt him:) But ſaid, that it was an old Commiſſion, and what he meant was well known to himſelf; but what conſtruction others had made of it might appear by his preſent condition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He diſcovered little ſenſe of ſorrow, or fear of Death; but ſaid, <hi>He was ready to ſubmit,</hi> or words to like purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Then he addreſſed himſelf to private prayer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; and kneeling down to the Block he prayed privately for a ſhort ſpace: Then laid his head upon the Block, and at the ſigne given, the Executioner ſevered his Head from his Body at one Blow: And his Friends put his Body into a Coffin, and removed it into a cloſe Coach prepared neer the place.</p>

               <p>AS ſoon as Sir <hi>Henry Slingsby's</hi> body was removed, as is aforeſaid, Dr. <hi>Hewet</hi> was brought upon the Scaffold, whither being come (together with Dr. <hi>Wild,</hi> Dr. <hi>Warmſtry,</hi> &amp; Mr. <hi>Barwick</hi>) he fell upon his knees, and prayed privately for the ſpace of a quarter of an hour; After that he prayed audibly for a good ſpace.</p>
               <p>After which prayer he addreſſed himſelf to the people in a ſpeech which continued above the ſpace of an hour; the ſubſtance of which ſpeech was as followeth.</p>
               <p>I am now become a publick Spectacle to Men and Angels, and (I hope) God, who is Omniſcient, is
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:51765:113"/>
now beholding me with much pity, and great mercy and compaſſion; and the more, becauſe I am now come to that end that his own Son came into the world to, To bear witneſſe to the truth; he himſelf ſaid, <hi>For this end was</hi> I <hi>born, for this cauſe came</hi> I <hi>into the world, that</hi> I <hi>ſhould bear witneſſe to the Truth</hi>: I was brought into the world (the Chriſtian world) for to bear witneſſe to the truth of the Goſpel, as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Chriſtian; I was brought into the world (the Church) as a Miniſter of his bleſſed Word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments; [Bleſſed be his name for that great honor and dignity;] and I came into the world to die more immediately for the teſtimony of JESUS, which God hath now called me to. I came into this world (this Common-wealth) to be a member thereof, to bear witneſſe to the Truths of the Cuſtomes, the Laws, the Liberties, and Priviledges thereof; So I am a member of the Common-wealth: And me thinks it ſeems to me a ſtrange thing, that in as much as we all plead for Liberty, and Priviledges, and I pleading for the Priviledges, the Laws, the Statutes, and the Cuſtomes of this Land, yet I ſhould die by thoſe that ſhould ſtand for the Laws, the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, and Priviledges, of the Land: And I am here beheld by thoſe that plead for their Liberties, and I hope I am pitied, becauſe I here give up my ſelf wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly and freely to be a State-Martyr for the publick good; and I had rather die many deaths my ſelf, than betray my fellow-freemen to ſo many inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies that they might be like to ſuffer by being ſubject to the wills of them that willed me to this death.</p>
               <p>And it is worthy remembrance, that Mr. <hi>Solicitor</hi> having impeached me of Treaſon to the Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Court againſt his Highneſſe, I did often
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:51765:114"/>
(when brought before thoſe Commiſſioners) plead for the Liberties of the people of <hi>England,</hi> though I had no knowledge of the Law, yet I had inſtruction from thoſe that were learned in the Law, and had ſeveral Law-Caſes and Preſidents put into my hand, though not by them, and urged ſeveral Law-Caſes, and made my Appeal, Firſt, for the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature that I was to be tryed by, Whether it were according to Law? Whether it were according to the Act? And whether it were according to the words of the ſaid Act? I did appeal to have the ſaid Act argued by learned Lawyers on both ſides, and then to be reſolved by his Highneſſe own Councel, which was denied me, [This by the by] I preſſing the Argument made a ſecond Appeal that thoſe Judges if they would give ſingly their ſeveral Judgements that it was a juſt and lawfull Court of Judicature, I would anſwer to my Charge. I did make another Appeal to thoſe that were his Highneſs's Councel, and pleaded againſt me, That if they would deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it to me under their hands to be according to Law, I would then go on to plead and anſwer to the Charge. What was then ſaid further, my ſpirits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faint, I ſhall not ſay much, but only this, I was taken in three defaults upon formality of the Court. It ſeems it is a cuſtome in all Courts, (which I did not know before) that if they anſwer not the third time ſpeaking by the Clerk, that then they are guilty of three defaults, and proceeded againſt as mute: [I had no ſuch knowledge of the Law.] So they found me guilty of thoſe defaults; and when I would have pleaded, and reſolved to begin to plead, I was taken from the Bar. I did the next day make my Petition to the Court in the Painted-Chamber, two Petitions were preſented the ſame in effect; the former the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:51765:114"/>
Title was miſtaken: Yet becauſe the Title was miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and no anſwer given, therefore it was that another Petition was drawn up to the ſame effect, with a new Title given, (as I remember) preſented by the Serje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant at Arms, and one writ it over in ſuch haſte, leſt they ſhould be drawn out of the Painted-Chamber into the Court, that I had not time to read it over, only I ſubſcribed my name, and there was in the front of the Petition a word left out, but what the word was I know not; and this was taken ſo ill, as if I had put an affront and contempt on the Court; And it was thought they would have heard me plead; and then, becauſe of that miſtake, they ſent word, I ſhould have my anſwer when I came into the Court, and my anſwer was the ſentence of condemnation. And therefore I pray with all my ſoul, that God would forgive all thoſe that occaſioned the charge to be drawn againſt me, to give ſuch unjuſt things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me: I pray with all my ſoul, that God would forgive all thoſe that upon ſo ſlender and ſmall grounds adjudg'd me to die, taking advantage of ſuch ſimple ignorance as I was in. And I had at the very beginning of my pleading engaged their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, no advantage ſhould be taken againſt me to my prejudice, that in as much as I underſtood nothing of the Law: And having heard that a man in the ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cety of the Law might be loſt in the ſeverity thereof meerly for ſpeaking a word out of ſimple ignorance, I made it my prayer to them, that no advantage might be taken againſt me to the prejudice of my perſon: and there was to me a ſeeming conſent; for the Preſident told me, there ſhould be no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage taken againſt me: and upon theſe conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons I am afraid there was too great uncharitableneſs: But I pray God forgive them from the very bottom
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:51765:115"/>
of my ſoul, and I deſire that even thoſe that ſhed my bloud, may have the bowels of the God of Mercy ſhed for them.</p>
               <p>And now having given you the occaſion of my coming hither, it is fit I ſhould give you ſomewhat as concerning my ſelf, as I am a Chriſtian, and as I am a Clergy-man. Firſt, as I am a Chriſtian, I thank God I was baptized to the Holy Church, ſo I was baptized to be a Member of the holy Catholick Church, that is, the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which I dare ſay for purity of Doctrine, and orderly Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, till a ſad reformation had ſpoiled the face of the Church, and made it a querie, whether it were a Church, or no? I ſay, it was more purely Divine and Apoſtolical, than any other Doctrine or Church in the Chriſtian World, whether National, or Claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical, or Congregational: And I muſt tel you, That as I am a Member of this Church, ſo I am a Member of the holy Catholick Church, and ſhall give a moſt juſt confeſſion of my Faith, both negatively and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatively. Negatively, I am ſo a Member of the holy Catholick Church, that I abhor all Sects, Schiſms, Sedition, and Tyranny in Religion. Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matively ſo, That as I hold Communion with, ſo I love and honour all Chriſtians in the world, that love the ſame Lord JESUS in ſincerity, and call on his Name, agreeing with thoſe truths that are abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary and clearly demonſtrated in the Word of God, both in the Old and New Teſtament, though in charity diſſenting from ſome others that are not neceſſary. And I, as I am thus a Chriſtian, I hope for ſalvation through the merits of Chriſt Jeſus, his bloud I rely on, his merits I truſt to for the ſalvation of my own ſoul: though to this Faith Good Works are neceſſary, not meritorious in us, but onely made
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:51765:115"/>
meritorious by Chriſt his death, by his all-ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, by his ſatisfaction, and his righteouſneſſe, they become meritorious, but in us they are no other than as defiled Rags. And truly, as I am a Member of the Church, ſo I told you, I was a Member of this Community, and ſo pleaded for the Liberties and Priviledges thereof. I muſt now anſwer ſomething I am aſperſed withall in the world.</p>
               <p>They talk of ſomething of a Plot, and a Treaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gn, and that I had a great intereſt in the knowledge and practiſe thereof, and that, for the ſaving my life, I would have diſcovered and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed I cannot tel what. I hope my converſation hath not been ſuch here in this City, where I have been a long time very wel known, as to make one imagine I ſhould intermeddle in ſuch an action, and go ſo contrary to the practiſe of my profeſſion: and I hope there are none ſo uncharitable towards me, as to believe I had a knowledge of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.</p>
               <p>Here I muſt come to particulars for a Plot, of having a deſign upon the City of <hi>London,</hi> for the firing of it. I ſo much tremble at the thought of the thing that ſhould have been done, as they ſay, for the carrying on of ſuch a deſign, (if my heart de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me not) had I known it, I ſo much abhor the thing, I ſhould have been the firſt diſcoverer of it: Nor ever had I correſpondencie or meetings with ſuch perſons as would have carried on ſuch a deſign. It is ſaid likewiſe, I entertained the Earl, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs of <hi>Ormond</hi>: To my remembrance I never ſaw the face of that honourable perſon in my life. It is ſaid, One Lords day I did preach at Saint <hi>Gregories,</hi> and the next Lords day I was at <hi>Bruſſels</hi> or <hi>Bruges,</hi> and kiſt the Kings hand, and brought I cannot tel
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:51765:116"/>
what Orders and Inſtructions from him. This I ſhal ſay, For theſe three years laſt paſt together, I have not been ſixty miles from this City of <hi>London,</hi> and I think it is ſomewhat further to either of thoſe places, than threeſcore miles. It is ſaid that I kept corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence with one <hi>Mallory</hi> and <hi>Biſhop</hi>: They are perſons I have heard of their names, but never ſaw their faces; and to my knowledge I do not know they know me: nor do I know them at all, but onely as I have heard of their names. And whoſoever elſe hath ſuggeſted ſuch things againſt me, I know not.</p>
               <p>His Highneſs was pleaſed to tel me, I was like a flaming Torch in the midſt of a ſheaf of Corn: He meaning, I being a publick Preacher, was able to ſet the City on fire by ſedition and combuſtions, and promoting deſignes. Here truly I do ſay, and have it from many of thoſe that are Judges of the High-Court, that upon examination of the buſineſs they have not found me a medler at all in theſe Affaires. And truly I muſt needs ſay therefore, That it was a very uncharitable act in them (who ever they were) that brought ſuch accuſation againſt me, and irritated his Highneſs againſt me. I will not ſay it was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, it might be zeal, but it was raſh zeal which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed me to be ſentenced to this place: The God of mercy pardon and forgive them all. And truly, as I am a Member of the Church, and as a Member of the Community where on behalf I have been ſpeaking, I cannot but do as our Saviour himſelf did for his Diſciples when he was to be taken from them, he bleſſed them, and aſcended up to heaven. My truſt is, in the mercy of the moſt High I ſhall not miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and however my daies are ſhortned by this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected doom, and ſhal be brought untimely to
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:51765:116"/>
the grave: I cannot go without my prayers for a bleſſing upon all the people of this Land, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but bleſs them all in the name of God, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech God to bleſs them in all their waies, and his bleſſing be upon them.</p>
               <p>Let us pray.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O Moſt glorious Lord God, thou whoſe dwelling is ſo far above the higheſt Heavens, that thou humblest thy ſelf but to look upon the things that are in Heaven, and that are in earth, and thou doſt what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever thou wilt both in Heaven, in Earth, in the Sea, and in all deep places. In thy hands are the hearts of all men, and thou turneſt them which way ſoever thou wilt. O Lord! look in mercy and compaſſion, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee, on this great and numerous people of this Land; look upon them, O Lord! with an eye of pity, not with an eye of fury and indignation; O look not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all thoſe great and grievous ſins that have provoked thee most juctly to wrath and displeaſure againſt us. Gracious God! who can ſtand in thy ſight when thou art angry? when thou with rebuke doſt correct man for ſin, thou makeſt his beauty to conſume away like as it were a Moth fretting a garment. O Lord! thy indignation and wrath lies heavy upon us, and thou haſt vexed us with ſcourges, thou haſt made us a reproach and a by-word amongst our Neighbours, and the very Heathen laugh us to ſcorn. Oh that thou wouldest turn us again, O Lord God of hoſts! that thou wouldſt ſhew us the light of thy countenance, that we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it; that thou wouldſt humble us for all thoſe ſins and grievous tranſgreſſions that are amongst us; for thoſe Atheiſms, for thoſe infidelities, horrid Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and Prophaneneſſe, for thoſe Sacriledges, for
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:51765:117"/>

What have we not deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved? Yet O the long-ſuffering, and patience, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our God! O Lord our God! we pray thee that thy patience and long-ſuffering might lead to repentance, that thou wouldſt be pleaſed, thou who delighteſt not in the death of a ſinner, but rather that he ſhould turn from his ſins and live, that thou wouldeſt turn us unto thee, O Lord! and we ſhall be turned: Draw us, and we ſhall run after thee: Draw us with the Cords of love, and by the bands of loving kindneſs, by the powerful working of thy holy ſpirit in our ſouls, working contrition in our hearts, and a godly ſorrow for all our ſins, even a ſorrow to repentance, and a repentance to ſalvation never to be repented of. Lord break theſe ſtony hearts of ours by the hammer of thy word, molifie them by the oyle of thy Grace, ſmite theſe rockie hearts of ours by the Rod of thy moſt gracious power, that we may ſhed forth rivers of tears for all the ſins we have committed. O that thou wouldſt make us grieve becauſe we cannot grieve, and

to weep, becauſe we cannot weep enough: That thou wouldeſt humble us more and more in the true ſight and ſenſe of all our provocations againſt thee, and that thou wouldeſt be pleaſed in the bloud of Jeſus Chriſt to cleanſe us from all our ſins; Lord let his bloud that speaks better things than that of <hi>Abel,</hi> cry louder in thine ears for mercy, then all thoſe miſchiefs and wickedneſſes that have been done amongst us for vengeance. O be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sprinkle our polluted, but penitent ſouls, in the bloud of Jeſus Chriſt, that we may be clean in thy ſight, and that the light of thy countenance may ſhine upon us. Lord! be pleaſed to ſeal unto our ſouls the free pardon and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of all our ſins; Say to each of our ſouls, and ſay that we may hear it, that thou art well pleaſed with us, and appeaſed towards us. Lord! do thou by thy spirit aſſure our ſpirits, that we are thy children, and that thou art reconciled to us in the bloud of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> To this end, O Lord! create in us new hearts, and renew right spirits within us: Caſt us not away from thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and take not thy holy ſpirit from us; but give us the comfort of thy help, and eſtabliſh us with thy free spirit. Help us to live as thy redeemed ones, and (Lord!) let us not any longer by our wicked lives deny that moſt holy faith whereof our lips have ſo long time made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, but let us that call on the name of the Lord <hi>JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS,</hi> depart from iniquity, and hate every evil way. Help us to cast away all our tranſgreſſions, whereby we have tranſgreſſed, and make us new hearts. Carry us along through the Pilgrimage of this world, ſupplying us with all things needfull for us; thy grace alone is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for us: Lord! let thy grace be aſſiſtant to us, to strengthen us againſt all the temptations of Satan, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially againſt thoſe ſins wherunto we are moſt prone ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by cuſtom or conſtitution, or moſt eaſily provoked. O Lord, with what affliction ſoever thou ſhalt puniſh, do

not puniſh us with spirituall judgements and diſertions. Give us not over to our own hearts luſts, to our vile, lewd and corrupt affections. Give us not over to hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and impenitency of heart, but make us ſenſible of the leaſt ſin, and give us thy grace to think no ſin little committed againſt thee our God, but that we may be humbled for it, and repent of it, and reform it in our lives and converſations: And Lord! keep us from preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ſins, O let not them get the dominion over us, but keep us innocent from the great offence, O Lord our ſtrength and our Redeemer. And Lord! ſanctifie unto us all thy methods and proceedings with us, ſitting us for all further tribulations and tryalls whatſoever thou in thy divine pleaſure ſhalt be pleaſed to impoſe upon us; Lord give us patience, conſtancy, reſolution and forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to undergoe them, that though we walk through the valley of the ſhadow of death, we may fear no ill; knowing that thou, O Lord! art mercifull with us, and that with thy rod as well us with thy ſtaffe thou wilt ſupport and comfort us: and that nothing ſhall be able to ſeparate us from thy love which is in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> our Lord.</hi>
