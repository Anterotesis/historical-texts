            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AFter having heard the Report of the <hi>Sieurs de Heeckeren,</hi> and the other Deputies of their Lordſhips for Forreign Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, who in order to the performing their Reſolution of the 11th of this Month, have ſeen and examined the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial of which the <hi>Marquis d'Albeville,</hi> Envoy Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary of His Majeſty of <hi>Great Brittain,</hi> had preſented unto them the 8th of the laſt Month, and on the 6th of this inſtant, mentioned more at large in the Acts of the ſaid Day, and having thereupon maturely deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berated, their Lordſhips have thought ſit, and reſolved to return in Anſwer to the ſaid <hi>Marquis d'Albeville,</hi> That their Lordſhips having ſeen the Declaration, which the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador had made them as well by Word of Mouth, as in Writing in a Publick Audience, the 9th of <hi>September</hi> laſt, That His Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty had the ſtricteſt Engagements of Friendſhip and Alliance with His Majeſty of <hi>Great Brittain,</hi> as is expreſs'd in the ſaid Declaration, their Lordſhips do believe they have reaſon to demand a more plain and clear Explanation of the matter in Terms more agreeable and civil. And ſince it has pleas'd His Majeſty of <hi>Great Brittain,</hi> moſt ſeriouſly to diſclaim them, (as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to this State) they do declare, That they neither have had, nor have any Intention to enter into a War with His Majeſty, or with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, for whom they have the moſt dear Regard; and that there is no People with whom they more heartily deſire to live in a cordial and ſincere Friendſhip with, than with His Majeſty and the ſaid Nation. That with the greateſt Regret they have ſeen and obſerved, how thoſe who envy ſuch their Happineſs, have endeavoured to excite in His Majeſty great Diſcontents towards this State, and to give him publick Marks of it, ſuch their Malice; becauſe they ſee, to their great Grief, the Diſcontents which the irregular Conduct of ſome Men have given to the Nation, as well in regard of the Reformed Religion, as of the Liberty and Security of the Nation. That their Lordſhips do wiſh nothing more than to ſee the ſaid Diſcontents ſincerely and abſolutely taken away, the Reformed Religion maintained and eſtabliſh'd, and the Liberty of the Nation preſerved; to the end that His Majeſty and the Nation, may thus re-enter into a good Underſtanding and Confidence in each another, and that they do Sincerely and in Truth proteſt, That they have no other End or Deſign, than the deſired Quiet of His Majeſties Kingdoms, and his Powerful Co-operating with them for the Preſervation of the Peace of <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> and the Treaties which have ſince fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.</p>
