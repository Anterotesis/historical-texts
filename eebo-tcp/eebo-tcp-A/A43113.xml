            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To his much Honoured FRIEND, Sir <hi>John Hartop,</hi> Baronet.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THAT which gave the Occaſion of my thoughts pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon this ſubject matter, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt's Manhood in Heaven, was that Diſpute betwixt Mr. <hi>Hicks,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Pen,</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> concerning the ſame. I being there preſent, am ſatisfied by the Quakers fallacious management of that Diſcourſe, that they deny the ſame Numerical true and real Manhood of Chriſt in Heaven, as a place remote from us. Since that I have had Diſcourſe with a Neighbour Quaker, <hi>William Bates,</hi> who frequently ſaid, He did not believe that the Humane Nature, that which was taken by Chriſt of the Virgin, had now any being. I have three Witneſſes of this, whom I can produce if need be.</p>
            <p>Sir, I may boldly ſay, That neither you, I, nor thouſands more of Chriſtians in this Nation, ever thought that we ſhould live to ſee that day, wherein ſo many thouſands, pretending to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, in this Nation, ſhould be ſo Brazen-foreheaded as to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own <hi>Jeſus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth</hi> to be the Meſsiah; yet ſo it is. <hi>O Tempora, O Mores!</hi> The Ends of the World are come upon us. My Spirit being ſtirred within me at the hearing of this grand Fundament al Errour, I thought it my duty to the
<pb facs="tcp:52452:3"/>Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to Antidote the poor Country, as much as in me lieth, againſt theſe damnable Deluſions; it made him ſpeak that was dumb before, when he ſaw his Fathers Life in danger. So what Babe, what Novice will want a Mouth, a Tongue to ſpeak, a Hand, a Pen to write, when the Man Christ is ſtruck at by ungodly Seducers? Therefore I, though the leaſt and moſt unfit of my Brethren, have Printed my Notes, Preached (you know) at <hi>Hartford,</hi> and humbly preſent them to you, Sir, as to one whom I know to be a ſincere lover of the One Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator betwixt God and Man, the Man Chriſt Jeſus, and of his Evangelical Truths. Pray, Sir, vouchſafe to read them, and candidly bear with what may not be ſo congruouſly worded in ſo ſublime a Myſtery. The Lord by his Spirit eſtabliſh, ſettle, ſtrengthen you, in this and every Truth, and preſerve you and your Elect Lady, both as Veſſels of Honour, to his heavenly Kingdom, there to behold the Man Jeſus Chriſt in his Glory, which is best of all.</p>

               <bibl>1 PETER, 3.22.</bibl>
               <p>
                  <hi>Who is gone into Heaven, and is on the Right hand of God.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> is here ſpeaking of the Grounds of Comfort to the guilty Conſciences. One is in <hi>Verſ.</hi> 21. <hi>The Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt. The anſwer of a good Conſcience through the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>He roſe again for our Juſtification.</hi> He being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted by the Father then, His Members are acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted now.</p>
            <p>A ſecond Propoſition in order to the Anſwer of a good Conſcience is, <hi>The Aſcenſion of Jeſus Chriſt, and his ſitting at the Right-hand of God; all things being made ſubject to him.</hi> To ſee by Faith our Head exalted into Glory, and there Advocating for us, and Ruling for us, is a very comfortable thing.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:52452:4"/>
            <p>In the 18 <hi>Verſe,</hi> he is ſpeaking of Chriſt's being put to death in the Fleſh, but quickned by the Spirit, <hi>(i.e.)</hi> the Divine Power: Then deſcends to ſpeak of his <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> as the true ſolid Ground of the <hi>Anſwer of a Good Conſcience;</hi> and from this <hi>Reſurrection</hi> deſcends to ſpeak of his <hi>Aſcenſion.</hi> So then, That ſame Jeſus that was put to death in the Fleſh, and Raiſed by the Power of God from the Dead; That ſame is gone into Heaven.</p>
            <p>It's plain then, that he was put to Death in his fleſhly Body, and in This it was that he Roſe again: Why then, in This is he gone into Heaven, and in This is he at the Right-hand of God. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, it ſpeaks a Motion from one Place to another, a Change of the Place: Now, Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther went he? Into Heaven. Heaven is not every where, as ſome ſay, and ſo this Change is only a Change of State: But Heaven is a Place where God doth manifeſt moſt of his Glory: It's called, the <hi>Heaven of Heavens,</hi> and the <hi>third Heaven,</hi> whereunto <hi>Paul</hi> was wrapt up. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6.21. <hi>Hear thou from thy dwelling-Place, even from Heaven.</hi> It's called here, and 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.30. <hi>Gods Dwelling-Place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>John</hi> 14.2. It's called the <hi>Fathers Houſe; In my Fathers Houſe are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Manſions: I go to prepare a Place for you.</hi> [<hi>And is on the Right-hand of God.</hi>] An Alluſion to the Cuſtom of Kings, who were wont to take their Favourites and place them on their Right-hand, as <hi>Solomon</hi> placed his Mother at his Right-hand: And as <hi>Zebedee</hi> would have had her Sons at Chriſt's Right-hand in his Kingdom. It is a Place of Honour, Glory, Power and Authority.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Learn this Truth from the Words.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the Same Jeſus Chriſt that was put to Death in the Fleſh, and did Riſe with that Same Fleſh again; That Same Jeſus, in that Same Fleſh and Man-hood is now in Heaven; which is a Place, not a State only; there he is at Gods Right-hand in Power and Glory: So that, as to that Humane Nature he is not upon Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will prove this; <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt is now a true real Man in Heaven,</hi> and ſo, <hi>Is not here on Earth as he is Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That ever <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was a true real <hi>Man,</hi> ſome have denied, and have held, That it was only an <hi>Appearance</hi> or <hi>Spectrum,</hi> in the ſhape of a <hi>Man:</hi> And ſome are of this mind now. But we will take this for granted, That <hi>Christ</hi> was once here on Earth, a real true <hi>Man;</hi> but that he is ſo Now, the <hi>Quakers</hi> deny.</p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:52452:4"/>
               <p>A Man conſiſts of theſe two Eſſential Parts, <hi>viz.</hi> Soul and Body: Both theſe Chriſt had. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.5. <hi>A Body haſt thou prepared me.</hi> That which was taken by the Virgin, which conſiſts of Fleſh and Bones, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.39. <hi>A Spirit hath not Fleſh and Bones, as ye ſee me have.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. A Soul he had, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.38. <hi>My Soul is ſorrowful even unto Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That both theſe Eſſential Parts, Soul and Body, are now in Heaven, I am now about to prove, a Place remote from us, ſo that he cannot be ſaid, as to his Corporal preſence, to be here on Earth.</p>
               <p>Though we believe that this Soul and Body is in Union with the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head in Heaven, and ſo he is Mediator in both Natures; take this by the way.</p>
               <p>That the <hi>Quakers</hi> may not deceive you by their Juggles; <hi>Chriſt was a Perſon before he took Man's Nature.</hi> They may grant to you, that Chriſt is a Perſon, and yet deny his Manhood; and grant a Manhood, and yet deny the Feſh in which he was to be in Heaven.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That his Soul is in Heaven, ſee <hi>Luke</hi> 23.46. <hi>Father, into thy hands I commend my Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What is become of that Soul that Chriſt had when he came to Die? Surely it did not vaniſh and periſh, but he commends it into his Fathers hands, as into a ſafe depoſitory, to be laid up, kept and preſerved; <hi>Luke</hi> 23.43. <hi>To day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe.</hi> Was not that Heaven? Now he ſpake this as to his Soul it's plain; for, as to his Deity, he was always there; as to his Body, that remained in the Sepulchre two dayes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His Body that's in Heaven, that Fleſh, and thoſe Bones that were handled by his Diſciples at the <hi>Reſurrection.</hi> And he himſelf ſaith, <hi>A Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit hath not Fleſh and Bones as ye ſee me have. Behold my Hands</hi> (Luke 24.39.) <hi>and my Feet, handle me and ſee.</hi> And they handled him, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.1 <hi>Whom our hands have handled, of the Word of Life.</hi> Now this Fleſh and Bones, thoſe Hands and Feet, that were handled, are now in Heaven.</p>
               <p>And, Luke 24.50, 51. <hi>He led them forth as far as Bethany, and he lift up his hands and bleſſed them. And it come to paſs, while he bleſſed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into Heaven.</hi> This Body was the proper Object of their ſight; The Soul they could not ſee, this was part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from them, this was carried up into Heaven. <hi>Act.</hi> 1.9. <hi>While they beheld, he was taken up.</hi> If he had ſecretly aſcended, more doubts might have riſen what was become of him; but he did openly-and viſibly Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend, having many Witneſſes of the truth and reality of it, that it might be out of doubt.</p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:52452:5"/>
               <p>Now if it be asked whither he did aſcend? the Angels give an accoutn, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 11. <hi>This ſame Jeſus which is taken up</hi> [<hi>into heaven</hi>] and obſerve how they ſpeak, <hi>This ſame Jeſus, as you have ſeen him go;</hi> They ſaw him with their Carnal Eyes; they were Eye-witneſſes of this thing.</p>
               <p>Other Scriptures opened to prove this, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.56. <hi>Behold, I ſee the Heavens opened. Stephen's</hi> ſight was ſtrengthened in a wonderful mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous way, ſo that he pierced to the very heavenly Glory with his Eye. This was more than what was natural, no doubt, for the other that ſtood by ſaw nothing, but he ſaw as much of the Heavenly Glory as he could bear; <hi>I ſee the Son of Man,</hi> denoting Humane Nature, when here on Earth, that he had it then at that time after his <hi>Aſcenſion.</hi> 1 Tim. 3.16. <hi>God manifeſted in the Fleſh;</hi> And the laſt Phraſe of the <hi>Verſe, received up into Glory;</hi> that fleſh wherein God manifeſted himſelf, <hi>was received up into Glory.</hi> Acts 3.21. <hi>Whom the Heaven muſt receive, until the reſtitution of all things.

               <p>Therefore all thoſe places where you read of Jeſus Chriſt by Name ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, are not to be underſtood as if Chriſt in Body came down from Heaven, but either they ſaw him, the Heavens being (as it is ſaid of <hi>Stephen</hi>) opened, or it was in Extaſie.</p>
               <p>Matth. 26.11. <hi>For you have the poor alwayes with you, but me you have not with you alwayes.</hi> Therefore he ſpeaks frequently to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of his Departure, that he would go away from them: <hi>Yet a little while and I am with you,</hi> John 14.2, 3. <hi>I go: and if I go to prepare a place.</hi> And now, Whither went he? He tells us, <hi>John</hi> 17.11. <hi>And now I am no more in the World, but theſe are in the World. I come to thee, Holy Father.</hi> Now this muſt needs be as to his Manhood, for the Father and He were one as to his Godhead, in Eſſence; and ſo he was with the Father from Eternity, <hi>John</hi> 1.1. <hi>In the beginning the Word was with God.</hi> Prov. 8.22. <hi>The Lord poſſeſſed me in the beginning of his wayer, before his works of old.</hi> Verſ 30. <hi>Then I was by him, (i.e.)</hi> before there was any thing created or framed.</p>

                  <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>Abſent from the Body: preſent with the Lord.</hi> While we are at home, we are abſent, or <hi>Pilgrims</hi> from the Lord. Now Chriſt as God, is immenſe, as to his preſence, he is every where, and as to his Saints, he is with them alwayes, and in them by his Spirit; then muſt it needs be ſpoke as to Chriſt's Bodily preſence.</p>
               <p>So in another place the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>I deſire to be diſſolved; and to be with Chriſt.</hi> He muſt needs ſpeak this as to his Soul, for <hi>Pauls</hi> Boyd was to ſleep in the Grave till the Reſurrection. But was not Chriſt preſent with <hi>Paul?</hi> Yea certainly, as to his Spirit; ſo he ſaith, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.17. <hi>The Lord ſtood by me;</hi> What then was this being with Chirſt, but to be as to his Soul, upon departure from the Body, in ſome certain place where the Soul and Body of Chriſt were, they could not be every where, for then this deſire of his was a vain deſire, and he withall wiſhes his Soul to be every where, and ſo to be Infinite, and to be God, which is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.20. he is mentioning Chriſt, and ſaith, <hi>Whom he raiſed from the dead, and ſet him at his own right-hand.</hi> Now what ever was raiſed, was ſet at the right-hand; The fleſh of Chriſt was raiſed; He here tells us what it is for Chriſt to ſit at Gods right-hand, <hi>viz.</hi> to have power over all things, to have all things put in ſubjection to him; which is taken from <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.4. where obſerve what is ſaid, <hi>What is Man that thou art mindfull of him, or the Son of Man that thou viſiteſt him?</hi> This ſtate of Exaltation in Heaven is applyed to him as Man, he is a Man in Heaven. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Out Mediator betwixt God and man, the Man Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> That Man that gave himſelf a Ranſom (for that followeth immediately) that Man is the Mediator betwixt God and man; therefore none of any ſort but may have hopes of being ſaved by him, upon Faith on him. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.14, 15. <hi>Seeing then that we have a great High Prieſt that is [paſſed into the Heavens.] We have not an High Prieſt that cannot be touched with the feeling of our Infirmities, but was in all points tempted as we are.</hi> He that was in all points tempted as we are, and ſo can be touched with the feeling of our Infirmities, that ſame is our High Prieſt, now paſſed into the Heavens, and that muſt needs be as to his Manhood, for his Godhead was not capable of ſuch temptations.</p>
               <p>Phil. 3. <hi>From whence</hi> (that is, from Heaven) <hi>we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who ſhall change our vile Body, that it may be faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed like unto his glorious Body.</hi> We ſee plainly from this Scripture, that Chriſt hath a Body, and that it is now in Heaven; from thence it ſhall come, when the time is, according to the Faith and Expectation of the Saints.</p>

               <head>Here followeth the Properties of this Manhood of Chriſt, from what hath been ſpoken, and what may be ſpoke.</head>
               <p n="1">1. IT is a real and true Body, as any man on earth hath; It is not, as ſome have thought, an Aerial Body, or ſo a Spiritual, that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains not ſtill a humane Body, it is that very Fleſh and Bons that <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> felt, and the Diſciples felt and handled.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It hath the ſame Form and Figure that it had when here upon Earth, elſe how could the Diſciples know him after the Reſurrection, which is a glorious ſtate of the Body.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is now ſince the Aſcenſion the Object of Senſe; It is viſible, hath been ſeen with the bodily Eye, and may be ſeen; <hi>Stephen,</hi> its evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, ſaw the Body of Chriſt; and <hi>Paul</hi> ſaw him with his bodily Eye, 1 <hi>Chr.</hi> 15.18. <hi>Laſt of all, I ſaw him,</hi> and at length, <hi>Every eye ſhall ſee him, coming in the Clouds of Heaven,</hi> Rev. 1.7.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is a ſmite body, if it were infinite it would be God and not Man, ſo then, there would be another God, in time, that was not before, becauſe another infinite being, and that muſt needs be God. Moreover, if Infinity can be attributed to it, why not Omniſciency, Incorporiety, Simplicity, and ſo all of Gods Attributes; for where any one of Gods Incommunicable Properties is aſcribed, there all the reſt may be.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is then circumſcribed, it muſt be ſtill in ſome one certain Place or other, not limited or confined to any one Place or corner (as it were) of Heaven, but ſtill in one place or other in the higheſt Heavens. If Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are not ſome where circumſcribed, they ceaſe to be Bodies, and ſo are no where, and ſo not at all.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It is an immortal, an incorruptible, impatable Body; Such thoughts we ought to have of it, not that it can ſuffer any thing now, but that it did ſuffer, and ſo Chriſt knows how to pitty us, and doth pitty us, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Death nor Corruption can come upon this Body, it ſaw Death be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but no Corruption.</p>
               <p n="7">7. It is a very glorious Body, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. <hi>Like unto his glorious Body.</hi> How gloriouſly it is repreſented and painted out to us by <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>John</hi> in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> more bright than a thouſand Suns.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The Saints may do, and ought to worſhip the Humane Nature of Chriſt in union with the Deity, we do not worſhip it by it ſelf apart, nor for it ſelf, but as in union with the Deity, this is the laſt term of our
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52452:6"/>Worſhip, with one and the, ſame Worſhip we worſhip him that is God and Man; but the cauſe and foundation of that Worſhip is the Deity; He received worſhip from ſeveral, when he was here on the Earth in the Fleſh; <hi>John</hi> worſhiped him in the Viſions he had as appears in the Book, of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> and there we read likewiſe, that the Angels and Elders round about the Throne, fell down and worſhipped the Lamb, that was Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="9">9. This Fleſh of Chriſt this Humane Nature is ſuch as giveth Life to our Souls, in quickening of us to Righteouſneſs, to our Bodies in the Reſurrection State, to Souls and Bodies Eternal Life at laſt in Heaven. <hi>Except you eat my Fleſh and drink my Blood,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 6.53. <hi>you have no Life in you.</hi> Likewiſe the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Our Life is hid, with Chriſt, in God.</hi> Now how is the Fleſh of Chriſt a Life procuring Fleſh?</p>
               <p n="1">1. As the material Cauſe of Life; Sin the Cauſe of temporal, ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and eternal Death, was expiated in the Fleſh of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. <hi>And for ſin condemned ſin in the Fleſh:</hi> By the offering of the Fleſh of Chriſt ſin was taken away; ſo that Righteouſneſs and Eternal Life, we may ſay, was, and is in the fleſh of Chriſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> in a way of merit; it is quickning Fleſh.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is quickning Fleſh as it is ſecondarily an efficient Cauſe of Life, Chriſt as Man doth concur to the quickning of his Members, us he is a Man he giveth forth of his Treaſures and ſpiritual Riches, and this Life is a great part of theſe Traaſures and Riches; But now there is a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Action in this efficiency of the Fleſh of Chriſt, and a different way of working, then when we are ſaid to be quickned by the Deity, Chriſt as Man, now he is in Heaven, quickneth efficiently.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> by his Interceſſion, the virtue of his Sacrifice pleads for this, and obtains this Life for us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe he hath a Will as he is Man, that we ſhould be quickned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As he obtaines the Spirit by which we are Regenerated, and Faith by which we are united to that Feſh of his.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> When we are thus <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> to us his Fleſh, and what is in that Fleſh <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> and Eternal Life. Thus we are quickned by the Fleſh of Chriſt, it is the Organ of the Deity, but ſo, as it is an underſtanding living Organ of the Eternal Word, in <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>

It ſpeaks of a more plentiful beffoſion of the Spirit, this plentiful effuſion was reſerved till this time of his Aſcenſion, to ſeal up the fruits of his Death and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection.

There it is, <hi>he received Gifts:</hi> He received them not for himſelf, but on purpoſe to give them to his Church, as Kings on their Coronation dayes beſtow gifts upon their Subjects, ſo here, this was reſerved till now for the honour of Chriſt: Therefore <hi>Verſe</hi> 10. it's ſaid, <hi>He aſcended that be might fill all things (i.e.)</hi> all the Church with the power and virtue of the Spirit. Therefore he ſaid upon his departure, <hi>It is expedient that I go away: if I go not away, the Comforter will not come with you: but if I depart I will ſend him unto you,</hi> John 16.7.

                     <p>The Conſideration of the Man-hood of Chriſt now in Heaven doth give a boldneſs and acceſs in Prayer. God hath rendred himſelf much more familiar to us this way.

                     <p>It was a great help and comfort to the <hi>Jews,</hi> that they had a Prieſt that was a Brother, one of themſelves, that was to Pray for them, and Offer for them, that was familiar with them, and they could have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs unto him.

            <p>THere is a Pamphlet printed by <hi>Chriſtopher Taylor,</hi> a Quaker, Enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled <hi>A true and faithful Witneſs to the Light.</hi> At the end where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there is a <hi>Poſt ſcript</hi> charging me with baſe Lies and Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; the weakneſs and impertinency whereof is a ſufficient Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of it ſelf to any judicious Reader, and I have been counſelled by my Friends to ſlight it by ſilence, as that which hath nothing in it that is worthy of Animadverſion. But not to gratifie that boaſting hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour that this Man, <hi>C. T.</hi> and all others of them are highly prone to, when any thing of theirs lyeth at our door unanſwered, though to this day my whole Book is at their door unanſwered, I thought good to give this brief Reply.</p>
            <p>There are Five Principal things [to wave all the bitter Invectives againſt me] that are mentioned.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That I charged</hi> Chriſtopher Taylor, <hi>that he ſaid, That the Doctrine of Election was a Deviliſh, Damnable</hi> and <hi>Blaſphemous Doctrine: This be this a notorious Lie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I offer at any time two ſubſtantial Witneſſes to prove that he ſaid it, if he dares come to the tryal, and that no ſuch thing was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by me, <hi>viz. That God ordained men to be wicked before they were born.</hi> God ordaineth to effect nothing but what is good; He willeth to permit evil by denying Grace, which would prevent it, yet this evil is from a mans ſelf, and God is not the author of it, becauſe he doth not effect it. How can God be the Efficient Cauſe of that which is a priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Can the Sun be the cauſe of Darkneſs, yet Darkneſs is the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of the Suns with drawing. If <hi>Chriſtopher Taylor</hi> pleaſeth I will enter the Liſts with him to make good this Aſſertion, <hi>That there is no Evil in the World but the Lord willeth to permit it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond thing is, <hi>viz. Chriſtopher T.</hi> with others contended againſt <hi>Original ſin.</hi> To which he ſaith, <hi>That the Devil is the Original of ſin in Mankind, and that be underſtands not how Infants can be guilty of ſin in the Womb.</hi> Nay he ſaith, <hi>That it is a cruel unnatural Doctrine to condemn Innocents (as be calls them) yea, an ungodby uncharitable Doctrine,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That the Devil is the Original of ſin in Mankind (<hi>i.e.</hi>) the firſt tempter to ſin, is a Doctrine we learned from <hi>Moſes,</hi> not from the <hi>Quakers.</hi> But what is this <hi>ad rem? Ergo,</hi> There is no Original ſin except it be the Devil, A ſtrange Argument. By Original ſin we mean,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52452:11"/>the Birth-ſin, that which man brings with him into the world, is from his firſt beginning and Original, and contracted from him that was the Original of Mankind, the firſt Man <hi>Adam,</hi> and is the Original of all actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſin. That all Infants have this ſin upon them, I will prove from the Scriptures againſt <hi>C. T.</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> only let it be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that my Charge is true by his own Confeſſion there in Print; I give but three Scriptures: <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. <hi>In whom,</hi> (i.e. the firſt Man) <hi>all have ſinned:</hi> Then Infants they are in him naturally. <hi>Nevertheleſs Death reigned from</hi> Adam <hi>to</hi> Moſes, <hi>even over them that had not finned of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the ſimilitude of</hi> Adams <hi>Tranſgreſſion,</hi> Verſe 14. Theſe are Infants here ſpoke of, that had not actually finned as <hi>Adam,</hi> yet Death reigned over them though they had not actually tranſgreſſed <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, as in the Verſe before is implied. How cometh it to paſs that Death is inflicted upon In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, if they have no ſin? Nay, violent Death. <hi>Is there any unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with God?</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. <hi>And Death by ſin.</hi> Were there any Infants drowned in the Deluge? or, any burned in the fire in <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrah?</hi> The third Scripture is <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.3. <hi>And were by nature Children of wrath even as others.</hi> If <hi>Paul</hi> and all the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were Children of wrath by Nature (<hi>i.e.</hi>) by Birth [as in another place he ſaith, <hi>We who are Jews by Nature,</hi> Gal. 2.15. (<hi>i.e.</hi>) by Birth, Parent, Original;] then were they ſinners by Nature, Birth, Original, from their Parents, otherwiſe they could not be righteouſly the Objects of wrath: but by this Scripture it appears, they were by Nature ſuch, <hi>Ergo.</hi> Let <hi>Chriſtopher Tailor</hi> anſwer this. If he ſaith that Chriſt took away this ſin from all Infants, then none are Children of wrath by Nature, and this Scripture is made a lye, then are all Children of Grace, as they come into the world, till by actual tranſgreſſion they render themſelves obnoxious to wrath. Whereas, he ſaith we condemn the Innocent, is a begging of the Queſtion in hand: And let the Reader judge, if in this he writes not too much like an Innocent? But this is the fruit of following the Light within, and forſaking the Scriptures; Nature will never diſcover its own guile and defilement, and the Light within, that every man hath, is no more than Nature.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I charge him for preaching the Covenant of Works in oppoſition to the Goſpel, by frequent repeating in his Diſcourſes to the People that ſaying, <hi>viz. Do this and live.</hi> He ſaith to this, <hi>That be directed to Chriſt Jeſus when he ſaid ſo, and to his Light within, that through Faith in him, the true Light, People might be ſaved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Obſerve, that firſt he doth diſtinguiſh Chriſt Jeſus and the Light, and then immediately makes them one and the ſame: <hi>Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus and his Light within.</hi> It follows, <hi>that through Faith in him, the true Light that lighteh every man,</hi> &amp;c. Now then this Light within every
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52452:12"/>Man is Jeſus Chriſt, according to this man's Divinity, and Jeſus Chriſt is nothing elſe but this Light, (if any thing beſides, let them declare what.) But the Scripture ſaith, this Light within every Man, is nothing but the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> written in the heart of Man, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Which ſhew the work of the Law written in their hearts.</hi> So then it remaineth good what I ſaid, That <hi>C. T.</hi> did preach the Law in oppoſition to the Goſpel, in uſing that expreſſion ſo much, <hi>Do this and Live.</hi> It will not ſerve to ſay as he doth, that he did not preſs People to the obſervance of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> in the Letter, only for Life; implying, that obſervance to <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, in the Letter and Spirit both, is ſufficient for Juſtification unto Life in the fight of God; which is the <hi>Quakers</hi> falſe Doctrine, and another Goſpel; and renders Chriſt's perſonal Righteouſneſs, his Obedience and Suffering altogether in vain. It is not our obſervance of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law in the Spirit, that is the matter of our Juſtification in God's fight, but that obſervance that the perſon of Jeſus Chriſt ſixteen hundred years ſince yeilded to the will of the Father in doing and ſuffering in the behalf of the Elect, in their room and ſtead, being imputed to them. May not I ſay, Are not the <hi>Quakers</hi> willingly ignorant of this, going about to ſet up their own Righteouſneſs? That <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Father of the faithful, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved <hi>Moſes</hi> Law in the Spirit as well as the Letter, yet this did not juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him unto Life in the ſight of God. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.2. If <hi>Abraham</hi> was juſtified by works he had whereof to glory, but not before God, his works done in the Spirit were not ſufficient. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.6. Even as <hi>David</hi> alſo deſcribeth the bleſſedneſs of the Man unto whom God imputed Righteouſneſs without Works, what Works? Done by the Spirit ſurely, for ſuch were <hi>Davids</hi> Works; he places this bleſſedneſs of Man, with all his obſervance of the Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> in the Spirit, in Forgiveneſs of Sin. Implying this, that there is need of non-imputation of ſin in the obſervance of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law in the Spirit in our beſt works. Did not <hi>Iſaiah</hi> obſerve <hi>Moſes</hi> Law in the Spirit? And yet in that place of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 64.3. (which <hi>Chriſtopher T.</hi> produceth in a jeer) calls it, <hi>fiilthy Raggs,</hi> as to Juſtification. Did not <hi>Paul</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve <hi>Moſes</hi> Law in the Letter and Spirit when a Chriſtian? An Apoſtle <hi>Rim. 7.</hi> 22. <hi>I delight in the Law of God after the inward man.</hi> Was not this to keep it in the Spirit? He kept it in the Letter before his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; <hi>Phil. 3. Touching the Law, Blameleſs;</hi> and this he counted <hi>Loſs for Chriſt,</hi> Verſ. 7. when he was converted to Chriſt: Nay, not only ſo, but he counted all things loſs <hi>for the Excellency of the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and then ſurely his obſervance of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> in the Spirit, in the point of Juſtification, for this is but his own Righteouſneſs, not the Righteouſneſs of him that is God, the perſonal Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, God and Man, which is to be received by Faith. I call <hi>Chriſtopher</hi> to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to theſe things, and not to uſe that expreſſion any more in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52452:12"/>to the People, thinking it enough to ſay, that he preached the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Faith; whereas the obedience of Faith taken in a found ſence, is quite contrary to that Doctrine that is held forth in that Phraſe, it is twice quoted by the Apoſtle, in the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of the <hi>Rom.</hi> and 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. v. and <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.12. and in both as oppoſed to the obedience of Faith, yea, in the latter, it is written plainly, <hi>the Law is not of Faith,</hi> they are contrary in the buſineſs of Juſtification. To that which he chargeth me with, <hi>viz.</hi> that I ſhould ſay, Though a man was regenerate, yet this was not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. I own it, do but add that which we were certainly ſpeaking of, <hi>viz.</hi> in Juſtification. He askes me what elſe muſt be added? I anſwer, The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt imputed, yea, and this alone, and ſingly nothing but this, hath any merit in it for my pardon and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in Gods ſight. The other of Regeneration, is but the making me meet for the Inheritance and Kingdom, which is given for the ſake of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, and this making meet is alſo for the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs-ſake of Chriſt: To this very thing, and why I call inherent Righteouſneſs the Righteouſneſs of the Law, at which the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſtorm, I have given ſufficient Reaſons in the Books I have written, which the Reader may enquire for, remaining ſtill in the ſame mind, That the holy Law of God requires all the Righteouſneſs that the beſt of the Saints have within them, or without them; therefore no more but the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the Law, by which we are not juſtified in God's ſight.</p>

            <p>To the Laſt he writes, that I askt him, <hi>Whether the Man Jeſus Chriſt were in him, and that he anſwered affirmatively:</hi> which he doth not deny, only puts his own Interpretation upon it: That by the <hi>Man Chriſt,</hi> he underſtands not the <hi>Body of Chriſt,</hi> but the <hi>Spiritual appearance of Chriſt.</hi>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I have in theſe Lines of <hi>C. T.</hi> obſerved much deceit, as here and elſe-where: in that he doth not truly repeat my Words, but rather adds ſomething of his own, or curtails and cuts off ſome of mine, or changeth ſome for others. The Queſtion was, <hi>Whether the whole Chriſt was within him,</hi> and he anſwered it affirmatively: My aſſumption was, <hi>Then the Man Chriſt,</hi> to which he replied, <hi>The Man Chriſt was,</hi> then what
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52452:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>is this Anſwer of his but meer evaſion? neither is the Godhead alone ſimply conſidered, the whole Chriſt, nor the Manhood alone, but both together: The whole Chriſt is God and Man; Now if the whole Chriſt be in <hi>Chriſtopher Taylor,</hi> not only Chriſt in his Spiritual Appearance, but as to his Manhood, that Soul and Body that is in Union with the Godhead. But why may not this be aſſerted by him without any ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity, while the <hi>Quakers</hi> deny that Chriſt hath any true real Manhood. There is a Jeſuitical inſinuation in the end of all: as if he had more againſt me than he had writ, or was willing at preſent to write. You may read the Kidney of this man by this: O how tender have the <hi>Quakers</hi> been of mine, Mr. <hi>Faldo's,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hicks</hi>'s Credit: How much engaged we are to them, that by their Tongues and Pens, they do not take our good Names from us; but they are known to be a ſelf-deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing People in this thing, witneſs <hi>C. T's.</hi> dreadful curſing me when in Priſon, and his railing upon me openly in the Street at <hi>Hartford,</hi> calling me <hi>Dagon, an Enemy to God,</hi> &amp;c. I know the modeſty of this man, that he would think no pains too much to ſcrape in the Kennels and Dunghills of mine and my Brethrens daily Infirmities, that he might have but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Dirt to throw upon us but the Lord pardon him; for, he knoweth not what he doth, nor what he writes; and bring him to the ſound know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Man Chriſt Jeſus, and his perſonal imputed Righteouſneſs for Juſtification, which I know he and all the <hi>Quakers</hi> are Enemies unto.</p>
