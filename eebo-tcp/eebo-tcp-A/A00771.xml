            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of christe &amp; of his vycare saynt Peter whiche vnder
christ was also the hede of christen people.</p>
               <p>¶And wyll ye se this more manyfestly by .iij. lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses.
Fyrst Moyses &amp; Aaron bothe of them were
preestes. Moyses was made by god. &amp; Aaron made
by Moyses at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dment of god. to whom was
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mytted y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cure of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Jewes in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> absence of Moyses.
So christ &amp; saynt Peter bothe were preestes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we
lawe. Christ made by his father almyghty god
as it is wrytten of hym. <q>Tu es sacerdos ineter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num

thou art a preest for euer according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> order of Mel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chisedech.
And Peter was made by christ. to whom
he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mysed in his absence y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cure of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> christen people
sayenge. <q>pasce oues meas pasce. pasce. pasce.</q>
The second likenes is this. Moyses was meane by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene

note well what authoryte was gyuen to Peter vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ferme all the other of his bretheren in
the stabyll waye. ¶The thyrd lykenes is this.

¶Thus euery man maye se how y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> shadowe &amp; this

and bad hym paye y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gaderers. bothe for
hymselfe and for chryst. Marke here y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this trybute
was heed money payed for them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were heedes and

Sithen it is manyfest that Aaron was called sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus

Moyses was no whit benethe hym. than must they
two eyther of them be summus. one of them vnder

saynt Paule maketh many hedes sayeng. <q>Caput

euer. and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the heed of this chirch the pope is vnder

to the members &amp; partes of the same body. whiche
be naturally ioyned vnto the heed. And so lykewyse
it must be in the mystycall body of our mother holy

whiche is the vycare of chryst. how can he haue in

spred vpon the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de dothe quycken &amp; make lyfely
many creatures the which before appeered as deed
who that vewed and beheld in the wynter season y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
trees whan they be wydred and theyr lefes shaken
from them and all the moystour shronke into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> roote
&amp; no lust of grenenes nor of lyf appeereth outwardly
yf he had had none experyence of this mater before
he wold thynke it an vnlyke thyng y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the same trees
shold reuyue agayne &amp; be so lustely clad with lefes &amp;
floures as we now se them. And yet this is done by
the subtyll operacyon and secrete workynge of the
sonne bemes spred vpon the grounde.
Neuerthelesse not euery beme of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sonne hathe this
vertue. It is a trouthe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bemes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> son<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e in wynter
be lyght as they be now this tyme of the yere but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
lyght is so faynt and feble that it gyueth no lyfe. for
than we sholde haue herbes and trees to growe as
wel in wynter as they now do this tyme of the yere.
The cause of this weykenes is. for the sonne shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
so lowe by the grounde that his bemes than
sklaunteth vpon the grounde and dothe not rebou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de

<pb facs="tcp:5919:9"/>
they wyll set tynder or clothe on fyre. And lykewyse
it is of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bemes of the faythe &amp; hope whan they be
ioyntly compacte and vnyte togyder. yf a man had

and this were a myghty faythe. Neuerthelesse yf a

charyte he were but as a deed tree. For saynt Paule
sayth. <q>Si habuero omnem fidem ita vt mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

yf I want the hete of charyte I am nothyng but as

James saythe. <q>Fides sine operibꝰ mortua est</q>
Faythe withouten y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fruyte of good workes is deed.
To this purpose our instruccyon saythe. <q>Ille testi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>moniu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

the true lyght y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whiche enlyghtneth euery creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re

That is to saye y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hete of the charyte of god is spred

in our hertes by the holy spyryte y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whiche is gyuen

lyght is lyfely. Haue a man neuer so moche lyght of
faythe onlesse he haue also this hete of charyte ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynge
his soule and bryngyng forthe lyfely workes
he is but a deed stock &amp; as a tree withouten lyfe. For
as I sayd though the naturall sonne shyne neuer so
bryght vpon a tree. yf this tree haue in it no grene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
nor puttyng forthe of buddes and lefes this tree
is not alyue. So whan y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bemes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> spirytuall son<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e
be spred vpon our soules yf we fele not the sterynge
hete to fruytfull workes our soules be but deed.</p>
               <p>¶But now to what purpose serueth this instruccy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
To this. it subuerteth one grete grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyn

y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the sacramentes of christes chirche dothe not
Justyfye but onely faythe. A perylous artycle able
to subuerte all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> order of the chirche. but touchynge
these sacramentes the kynges grace our souerayne
lorde in his owne persone hath w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his pen so substau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Plato saythe. <q>Tu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beatas fore respubli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cas

Ye se whan a bowle is throwen sklantlynge vpon a

dyrectly agayne to hym that was the thrower. but
whan it is dyrectly cast agaynst a wall with a grete
vyolence than it dothe dyrectly rebounde agayne.
In this maner it is of the sonne bemes y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more nye
that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sonne draweth vnto vs now this tyme of the
yere y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more dyrectly his bemes bete vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de
&amp; the more dyrectly they rebou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de &amp; retourne agayne
towardes y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> son<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e. And by the reason of the nyenesse
of beme to beme ryseth a greter strengthe in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beme
and a more full lyght. <q>quia om<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>is virtus vnita
fortior est.</q> that is to say. For euery vertue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
togyder is more stronger. ¶Asengell threde is
nothynge so stronge as is a double / nor a syngle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
of the sonne is nothyng so myghty as wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is
doubled and bowghted in it selfe by rebou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dyng and
reflexyon. Forthermore of these two ryseth an hete
&amp; a warmenes the whiche is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pryncypall worker of
lyfe in euery creature. But for all this we be not yet
sure that any tree is alyue to than we se some put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge
forthe of buddes or lefes out of the same tree.
¶This example yf ye perceyue it maye enduce vs
to conceyue how wonderfully the spyrytuall sonne
almyghty god worketh by his spyrytuall and inuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syble
bemes of his lyght spred vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the soule of man

a spyrytuall erthe. <q>Dominus dabit beni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnitatem
et terra nostra dabit fructu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> suu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</q>
That is to saye. our lorde shall gyue his gracyous
influence and our erthe shall yelde fruytful workes.
<pb facs="tcp:5919:11"/>
The bemes of almyghty god spred vpon our soules
quyckeneth them &amp; causeth this lyfe in vs and the
fruyte of good workes. Fyrst they cause y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lyghte of

reboundynge of hope &amp; the hete of charyte. faythe
w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>outen hope is a sklender beme &amp; of a lytle power.
But Joyne vnto hym hope whiche reboundeth vp

this is doubled and bowghted in it selfe and gadred

he had no veray fast hope y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he myght walke there.
He was not stronge in his faythe &amp; therfore our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyour
sayd vnto hym. <q>Modice fidei quare du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitasti.</q>
But of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> stronge faythe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hath a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fydence

<q>Si habueritis fidem sicut granu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sinapis di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cetis

That is to say. yf ye had faythe lyke vnto a corne of

For this grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de he bryngeth saynt Paule in dyuers
places sayenge y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a man is iustyfyed by his faythe
onely withouten workes. Neuerthelesse saynt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>styn

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued
in the begynnyng of the chirche for the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
as he saythe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other apostles in theyr epistoles
studyeth to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary parte. But some here thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
that Martyn luther lytle regardeth saynt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>styn.
And a trouthe it is. but yet that is a foule pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumpcyon.
let hym at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> least beleue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other apostles
whome withouten manyfest heresye he can not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye.
Saynt James sayth. <q>Ex factis iustificatur
homo &amp; no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ex fide tm<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</q> A man is iustifyed by his
dedes and not by his faythe alone. whiche thynge
saynt James dothe not onely saye but also proueth
it by dyuers wayes. One is this. <q>Demones cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dunt
et contremiscunt.</q> The deuylles he saythe
hathe faythe. &amp; yet no man maye say y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the deuylles
be iustyfyed by theyr faythe. How many that lyue

&amp; wold rather dye or they shold renye theyr faythe.
<pb facs="tcp:5919:12"/>
but for all that they be not iustyfyed. But yf onely
faythe dyd iustifye bothe they and the deuylles also
shold be iustyfyed. Second y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same example y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> saynt
Paule vseth vnto the Romaynes to proue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> faythe
iustifyed a synner withouten workes. y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same vseth
saynt James to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> contrary. the example I meane
of Abraham as there appereth in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same place. But
ye than wyll saye. Syr be these apostles one contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to an other. To this saynt Austyn saythe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> nay
forsothe. But y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> saynt James onely contrareth that
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> may be construed &amp; mystaken in saynt Paule. For
saynt Paule meaneth of the workes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> gothe before
faythe. &amp; saynt James meaneth of the workes that
folowe after the faythe. Saynt Paule meaneth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
worke of circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cysyon or of other workes of the lawe
was not necessary for the iustyfyeng of Abraham to
go before his faythe but his faythe withouten them
dyd iustyfye hym. Saynt James meaneth of the
fruytfull workes that folowe after faythe the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
gyue euydence of a lyfely faythe and these iusty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyeth
a man. and these he saythe yf Abraham had
not had. he had not ben iustyfyed yf Abraham had
not ben redy to offer vp his sone Isaac at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundynge
of god he had not ben iustyfyed. but
bycause he was so redy therfore he saythe. <q>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
ex operibus iustificatus est.</q> That is to
saye. Abraham was iustifyed by his workes. wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
saynt James speketh not agaynst saynt Paule
but agaynst the mysunderstandynge and myscon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyuynge
of hym. Of the whiche mysconceyuynge
saint Peter also speketh in his second epistle sayeng.
<q>
                     <pb facs="tcp:5919:12"/>

That is to saye in the epistoles of our

be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceyued whiche the vnstable myndes dothe mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>construe
lyke as they do many other scryptures to

this as nowe dothe Martyn luther to his owne pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryll

               <p>¶But here one thynge I merueyle moche of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyn

there is no more testymony agaynst hym but
this one place of saynt James. for it is not to be dou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted

That is to saye. gyue ye almes and all thynges shal

workes of almes. yf I beleue neuer so moche and yf
I releue not the poore in theyr necessyte I shall not

of Matthew. <q>Si remiseritis hominibus erra

That is to saye. yf ye do forgyue vnto them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hathe

               <p>Thus ye may se y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> these heretykes. all be it they had

And why maye not lykewyse Martyn luther be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued

he wanteth the spyryte of trouth / the whiche all

they sholde not haue erred in mysco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceyuynge y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> scryp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
I saye not but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they were redy in scryptures / &amp;
coude brynge the scryptures meruaylously to theyr
purpose and frame them cursedly to theyr opynyons.
but for lacke of the spyryte of trouthe they mysconstru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed

of the prophetes by almighty god y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father spake / and
to the true knowledge also of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> apostles / by whome the
sone our sauyour chryst Jesu spake but bycause they
had not this spyrite of trouth whiche was sente from
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father &amp; frome y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sone / therfore they were ignoraunt

remembred vnto you accordynge to my promesse
foure instruccyons y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be offred vnto vs of this gospell
gracyously. Fyrst y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the holy spyryte whiche is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thyrd

agaynst all stormes &amp; tempestes of heresyes / acertay<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nynge
vs in the tyme of euery doutulnes the veray
trouthe where vnto we shall holde &amp; kepe vs. By the
occasyon of this instruccyon I shewed .iij. thynges.
Fyrst y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this instruccyon &amp; all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hole gospell ꝑteyneth
to the vnyuersal chirche of chryst / whiche thynge I
proued by Luthers owne wordes. Second y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heed
of this vnyuersall chirche was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pope vnder chryst / whiche
one poynt taketh away one grete grounde of
Marty<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> luther &amp; shaketh sore many of his erronyous
artycles. Thyrde y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Martyn luther dyuydyng hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
from y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> heed of this body can not haue in hy<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this
spiryte of trouth. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> second instruccyon I shewed
you y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the hete of charyte spred in our hertes by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
spryte of god gyueth euydence of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lyfely lyght of
faythe / shynynge vpon oure soules fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our sauyour

an other grete grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of Marty<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> luthers / whiche is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
onely faythe dothe iustyfye a syn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>er w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>outen workes.
For the thyrde instruccyon I shewed y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> erudycyons
left vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chirch by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy apostles / bereth vnto vs
testymony of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fayth of chryste / and what thynge we
shall beleue in his chyrche / where also was losed an
other grounde of Martyn luther / which wyll not ad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>myt
any other testymony / but onely that y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is wryt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

must besydes y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> scryptures wrytten / receyue also the
tradycyons of the apostles not wrytten / ouer this y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> interpretacyons of scryptures made by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy
bysshoppes &amp; doctours of the chyrche / by whose mon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thes
the thyrde persone in the godhede the spiryte of
trouthe spake and speketh / enformynge y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chirche for
this tyme lyke as dyd y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father almyghty god by his
prophetes before / &amp; as dyd his sone y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> seconde persone
by hys apostles. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fourthe instruccyon I shewed
you y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the defence whiche is made for Martyn luther
by his adherentes wherby manye weyke soules be
ouerthrowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / is clerely take away by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moost louynge
&amp; moost gracyous forwarnynge of our sauiour christ
as ye haue herde in the ende of the gospelle. And yet
eftsones for his moost excellente charyte he warneth
all his chrysten people saynge and repetynge. <q>Hec
locutus sum vobis: vt quum venerit hora
eorum reminiseamini / quia hec dixi vobis.</q>
That is to saye. These thynges I haue tolde you to
thentent that wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers shall be fall yet ye may

thus often warned wyll yet gyue faythe to Martyn
luther / or to any other suche heretyke rather than to
christ Jesu &amp; vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> spyryte of trouthe / whiche is left
in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chirche of chryst vnto the worldes ende / specyally
to enforme vs of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trouth / this man goethe fer wyde
from y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> streygth way / &amp; is neuer lyke to entre into the
