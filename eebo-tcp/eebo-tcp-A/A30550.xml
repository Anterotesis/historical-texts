            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE PARLIAMENT of the Common-wealth of ENGLAND, who are in place of Authority to do Justice, and in present power to ease the oppressed Nation from its Bonds.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>Councel</hi> and <hi>Advice</hi> unto <hi>you,</hi> from a Friend that seeks after <hi>Truth and Righteousness</hi> from you, and alwayes faithfully desires the <hi>Nations</hi> good, and that the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> thereof may be <hi>established</hi> upon a <hi>Just</hi> and <hi>Equal</hi> and <hi>Right Foundation,</hi> that the <hi>Lord God</hi> may pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess his <hi>Right,</hi> and all men their <hi>Right</hi> in our Land, and that men of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>sound Judgement,</hi> may be set to Judge the people in outward things, and the Exercise of good <hi>Conscience</hi> in <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Worship</hi> left unto God, that Blessings and Mercies, true Freedom, Peace and V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, may run down as a stream in the Land of our nativity, and that all the contrary may be <hi>cast out,</hi> and <hi>removed</hi> far away from us, <hi>and</hi> for this <hi>Cause,</hi> these things fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing do I propound unto you, that you may read and consider, to the end that <hi>Righteousness</hi> alone may be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished in the Nation, both in the <hi>Foundation</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> of Government.</p>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>OR as much as this Nation, the Land of our Native inheritance (as we are members of it) hath long been held under great <hi>bondage</hi> and <hi>captivity,</hi> and the free-born people have born the heavy yokes of <hi>tyranny</hi> and <hi>oppression,</hi> both in respect of the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of <hi>Government,</hi> and also in respect of <hi>practice</hi> thereof;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:104277:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for not onely the practice, but also the very foundation of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> and the choosing of Governours also hath been out of course, and not rightly laid, nor established in Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, by reason of that darkness that hath been over all people, in the dayes of the reign of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> whose kingdome and government hath been in dominion in all <hi>Nations,</hi> ever since the falling away from the Faith, once delivered to the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and then came the <hi>earth</hi> to be subjected under the <hi>tyranny</hi> and <hi>oppression</hi> of that <hi>fourth Beast,</hi> Dan. 7. And while thus it hath been in our Nation that our <hi>Kings</hi> have attained to the Throne of Government <hi>hereditarily,</hi> and by succession of <hi>Birth,</hi> and our <hi>Parliaments</hi> and <hi>Rulers</hi> have attained to the place of Judgement over us, by such a way of traditional choise, as hath been the custom in our forefathers dayes (that knew no better, being in the dayes of Apostacy &amp; great ignorance themselves) and thus it hath continued for many <hi>Ages,</hi> whereby the Inhabitants have been alwayes suffering under, and lyable to great <hi>oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi> &amp; <hi>vexations,</hi> being subjected under such a <hi>Government,</hi> falling as aforesaid, from Parents to Children, after the manner of the <hi>Heathen Nations,</hi> and being subjected to such Laws, made and executed by men, not truly called and ordained of God thereunto, insomuch that nothing hath been perceived nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by men of the hand of the Lord, and of his good Spirit in the <hi>calling</hi> of our <hi>Kings,</hi> and <hi>choosing</hi> of our <hi>Rulers</hi>; but these things have com'd to pass and been after the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of men, and not after the Order and Councel of the Lord God; And our Nation hath been under the <hi>bonds</hi> of sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very in this respect, even because men have governed that ought not: and while the great and rich men hath been set to rule over the poor, and while men for earthly honour, and for riches sake in birth and breeding, have claimed to be <hi>Princes</hi> over us <hi>successively,</hi> and to be chosen our <hi>Rulers</hi> according to <hi>custom,</hi> without respect to their vertue and goodness, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out true <hi>calling</hi> from the Lord, or any certain <hi>Testimony</hi> from him, and thus it hath continued for many ages; because of which the <hi>free born</hi> people hath deeply suffered the cruel op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of <hi>proud</hi> and <hi>ambitious</hi> and <hi>self-seeking</hi> men, who hath long ruled for themselves, and not for the Lord, and have com'd into the place of Authority over us, otherwise then by appointment and <hi>right calling</hi> from the Lord, as I have said; and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:104277:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thus the <hi>Government</hi> of our Nation hath been out of course, and not as the Lord requireth it, even until this day, while great darkness hath remained upon the hearts of the people, which hath so blinded them, that they have not known their own <hi>bondage,</hi> nor yet how to be redeemed into <hi>perfect liberty,</hi> while they have subjected themselves (through ignorance) to be ruled by such men as had no right from God to that place of Rule and Government.</p>
            <p>But now in as much as the Lord God our <hi>deliverer</hi> hath begun to appear for the freedom of the Nations, and hath shewed us the <hi>captivity</hi> and <hi>bondage</hi> which our forefathers have lived un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and we our selves been subject and lyable too, by reason of the <hi>Government</hi> standing in a <hi>single person</hi> successively, and we being <hi>forced</hi> to live under the Authority of such men as had no right from God thereunto, as I have said; And now our eyes are opened to behold better things, and we are in good expectations, that the Lord will suddenly so appear, as to free us from future oppressions in this respect, for we look for a <hi>New Earth,</hi> as well as for a New Heaven, according to the Lords promise to us, which is to be fulfilled in these latter dayes; and that we shall have Judges as at the first, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors as at the beginning, and that all our bonds of oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion shall be broken, that have lain upon us by unjust men, who have made Laws, and executed them for us, without true calling to such a work; And the Lord alone will appear to be the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Judge</hi> and <hi>Law-giver</hi> over all, and will commit the <hi>giving forth</hi> and <hi>execution</hi> of good Laws into the power of faithful and just men ordained of God, who will Judge for him altogether, and not for man, neither will be perverted by earthly honour and riches, but will regard the Cause of the Poor, and the Afflicted; and these things we are waiting for, to be brought to pass in their season, and the hand of the Lord will accomplish it, if not by you, then even contrary to you. Wherefore I am moved in Spirit, and in love to you and to this Nation, to lay it before you, and to desire it of you (in whose hands the Liberties of this Nation yet remaineth) that you will so prepare and allow the <hi>Foundation</hi> of <hi>Government</hi> in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the Lord may be the chooser of our <hi>Rulers,</hi> to give and to execute righteous Laws for us, and that men that fears God and hates covetousness and every evil way, that <hi>Just</hi> men
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:104277:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and <hi>Righteous</hi> men, men of Truth and uprightness, men of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and soberness, men that are <hi>Constant</hi> to good Principles, and such whom the Lord hath blessed with the Spirit of <hi>sound Judgement,</hi> and with understanding, who may truly discern of Causes and equally Judge thereof, men that are for the Just freedom of all, and for the General good of all, and men that in all things will seek the glory of the Lord, be they <hi>rich</hi> or <hi>poor, high</hi> or <hi>low</hi> in birth or breeding; yet let such be Rulers among us, and Judge this Nation, that all that do well may have praise and be justified, and all that do evil may be afraid, and punished; and hereby shall the whole Nation be refreshed and comforted with the Mercies of the Lord, and his Name shall be the greatest among us, and <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Righteousness</hi> should run down, when <hi>Justice</hi> sits in the <hi>Throne</hi>; And not men for greatness sake, in Titles or Birth, or otherwise, Chosen in <hi>Tradition,</hi> and not by <hi>Appointment</hi> of God, but men for <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues</hi> sake, and not for <hi>earthly honour</hi> which perisheth, not <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous</hi> nor <hi>Ambitious</hi> men, not <hi>proud</hi> and <hi>vain-glorious</hi> men, not such as seeks the honour from below, that respects vain <hi>titles</hi> &amp; <hi>flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries</hi> of men, not such as will seek themselves, and be perverted by gifts, not such as are <hi>Persecutors</hi> for a good Conscience sake, that are <hi>Zealous,</hi> but not according to <hi>knowledge,</hi> not <hi>wilful</hi> and <hi>heady men,</hi> not <hi>unconstant</hi> and <hi>changeable men,</hi> not <hi>Traitors</hi> that have turned for self-advantage, and will change with the times to any way of Government for earthly honour, for such will Judge for man and not for God, not <hi>ignorant</hi> men that wants the Spirit of sound Judgement, nor such as are <hi>prophane</hi> and without the fear of God; nor such as these, be they <hi>rich</hi> or great, let not such be our Governours nor Judge over us, to <hi>make</hi> Laws and <hi>execute</hi> them for us in our Nation; let all such men be cast out from among you, and disenabled by certain Just restrictions from ever receiving <hi>Trust</hi> or <hi>Authority</hi> over us; for while such men have been in power and sate in the Throne, Justice and true Judgement have been perverted, and our Land hath groaned under oppre<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Land hath laid desolate because hereof; And therefore I call unto you on the Lords behalf, make way and prepare for Righteousness to sit as Judge, &amp; that men alone, that fears God, and are ordained of him thereunto, of what Profession or Birth soever they be, men of truth and justness, that have the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of a good understanding, and are called of God, may have Authority in our Nation, to <hi>give Laws</hi> and <hi>execute</hi> them for us, such being brought into a capacity by you to be chosen, for to such men appointed of God, and fitted for that end, and truly called of him, being qualified as aforesaid, do we give the Authority and Power in our Nation, to Judge and to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern in the things pertaining to this World, and over us as we are Members of this Nation, and over the outward man, and in the things between man and man, even to be a terrour to such as are without the fear of God, and to punish such by Just Laws without; as breaks the Law of God within, though to the Lord God alone, we give the Authority and Power over us to Rule us and to Judge us in that Relation, as we are Members of his Kingdom, and over our inward man, and in the things pertaining to <hi>our Consciences</hi> in all things related to his <hi>worship, and service, and faith, and practices in Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for as much as in the late dayes of darkness, through the unjust practice of Government in the hands of uncalled and ungodly men, the exercise of our Consciences hath been violated, by men not ordained of God, who have not known the perfect station, nor cause and end of <hi>Civil Government,</hi> nor how to Rule and Govern over us as men, and over our outward man (which is onely the end of outward Rule and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) but have assumed unjustly the Seat and Throne of Christ Jesus, and have ruled over our <hi>Consciences,</hi> and <hi>oppressed</hi> our <hi>inward man</hi> with false Judgement imposed upon us, through <hi>limitting</hi> of us <hi>from</hi> and <hi>compelling</hi> of us <hi>to</hi> such or such a way of worship and Religion, even contrary to the Spirit of God, taking upon them without any call from God at all, but as <hi>Vsurpers,</hi> to be Judges in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Doctrines,</hi> and <hi>Worships,</hi> wh<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

pertains to this world, and over the outward man; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I lay it before you that the <hi>Foundation</hi> of <hi>Government</hi> in our Nation may be so <hi>allowed, confirmed</hi> and <hi>established</hi> by you, as that the civil Magistrate may be prescribed by you, the very length and breadth, the heigth and depth of his Authority and Trust; and that the exercise and liberty of <hi>our consciences</hi> in the <hi>worship and service of God</hi> may not be intrusted with him to Judge over us in matters of <hi>Faith</hi> &amp; <hi>Doctrines</hi> &amp; <hi>worships,</hi> but that he may be wholly excluded, from medling in that case, and from imposing any thing upon our consciences in that relation; and may not have the Power to <hi>Limit</hi> us <hi>from,</hi> or <hi>compell</hi> us <hi>to</hi> any such or such way of worship and <hi>Religion, Church</hi> and <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,</hi> but that he may be secluded from Judgement over us, in all things pertaining to the <hi>Kingdom of Christ Iesus,</hi> and that our liberties and exercises in his <hi>worship</hi> and <hi>Church and Ministry</hi> may not be at all intrusted with any man, nor left to the Judgement of the <hi>civil Magistrate</hi>; for Christ alone by his good Spirit, is <hi>Supream Judge,</hi> over our inward man, in all things pertaining to <hi>worship, faith, Church and Ministry.</hi>

            <p>Wherefore I <hi>Call</hi> unto, and do <hi>advise</hi> you on the Lords behalf; Let <hi>conscience go free,</hi> and leave it to the <hi>exercise</hi> of the Spirit of God onely, do not <hi>limit</hi> the Lord, nor prescribe him <hi>a way,</hi> how he must be believed in and worshipped; for that belongs unto him and not unto you nor any man; therefore I <hi>demand</hi> of you as our perfect right that you suffer the Government of our Nation to be so <hi>established,</hi> as that God may have his Right (to wit) the full Government in all things pertaining to his own Kingdom; and the civil Magistrate may be secluded from Judgement over us, in all things concerning and appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the worship of our God, and faith towards him; <hi>And</hi> also that all unrighteous <hi>Lawes</hi> and Decrees, yet remaining in the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:104277:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Peace, and loving kindness, and tender mercies from the Lord spring forth in glory amongst us, and the Nation would be refreshed from all its sorrowes, and eased from all its oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and all righteous men would reioyce, and give glory to God, and Ages to come, should speak well of you, if that the <hi>Foundation of Government</hi> be so setled by you, as that every man may enjoy his <hi>right</hi> one from another, and be defended therein; and <hi>God the Creator</hi> of all may possesse his right from all, and be suffered to be the onely <hi>exerciser</hi> of his People in his <hi>worship,</hi> that he may have what is due and belongs to him from you and all People, &amp; such a Government would be blessed for ever; And if you fulfill this my advice you may be happy, but if you do not, but wil be <hi>oppressors of conscience</hi> by unjust laws, then the Lord will bring distruction upon you, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw your Power; and liberty will he bring some other way to his chosen heritage, in whom his soul delighteth; Therefore take this my Councel, even as you hope to prosper, for this I know from the Lord, upon the rejecting or receiving hereof dependeth your standing or your fall, your renown, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual reproach, even your blessing or your curse, and the time is at hand that many shall confesse the Lord gave good Counsel unto you, By his servant</p>
