            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>When in the yeer 1628<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Iohn Dury</hi> was in <hi>Pruſsia</hi> Miniſter to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company of Marchants re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding at <hi>Elbing,</hi> he was ſent unto, dealt withall, and moved by D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Godeman</hi> a wiſe, godly, and learned man, one of the King of <hi>Swedens</hi> Privy Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, and Judge of his high Court in thoſe parts, to ſecond him in a buſineſſe of Eccleſiaſticall Unitie amongſt Proteſtants, which he ſaid, his King and Maſter would be glad to advance. So good a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being readily entertained, it came to paſſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, when Sir <hi>Thomas Roe</hi> was ſent Ambaſſador
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:41561:3"/>
Extraordinary by his Majeſty of great <hi>Britain,</hi> to agree the <hi>Sweds</hi> and <hi>Polonians</hi> (which alſo he did ſucceſſefully perform) that both Doctor <hi>Godeman,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Dury</hi> did make him throughly acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with all the paſſages of their negotiation. Whereupon he according to that generous diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which doth lead him to favour all good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of a publike nature, did very willingly aſſiſt them with Counſell, and at Maſter <hi>Duryes</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty, conferred with the Lord Chancellor <hi>Oxon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiern,</hi> to ſee how farre he would ſhew himſelf in the buſineſſe, and what courſe might be reſolved upon to proceed joyntly to the effect thereof. The Lord Chancellor manifeſted a good liking to the work, and promiſed to my Lord Ambaſſador to joyn effectually therein towards his King, and the Lutheran Clergy of his beſt acquaintance. Upon this ground, my Lord Ambaſſador encouraged M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Dury</hi> to proceed, and when his Lordſhip was gone into <hi>England,</hi> the Lord Chancellor ſent for him, heard his particular propoſalls, conferred with him about the ſame, teſtified his willingneſſe to give aſſiſtance thereunto, and deſired M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Dury</hi> to give him information of the paſſages of the work in time to come, ſo he went from <hi>Elbing</hi> into <hi>Engl.</hi> in the yeer 1630. Chiefly, becauſe his Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation at <hi>Elbing</hi> was diſſolved by reaſon of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences which warre had brought upon the Trade in that place; and becauſe S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Thomas Roe</hi> had promiſed to move the chief Prelates in <hi>England</hi> to aſſiſt him in the work of pacification. Being then
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41561:3"/>
arrived there, he firſt acquainted his moſt familiar friends of the Clergy with his purpoſe, and ſhewed them ſome declarations written by the chief Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of <hi>Dantzigh</hi> to make it appear, that they were not only ready to joyn in ſuch a negotiation, but alſo deſirous and in hope that the Divines in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> would in like manner concur; which being done, he came to S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Thomas Roe,</hi> who was mindefull of his promiſe, and became every way as good as his word towards him. For he recommended the buſineſſe towards the Kings moſt Excellent Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie; who was pleaſed to refer the conſideration of this matter to my Lords Grace of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and to the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> that they ſhould hear M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Dury,</hi> and declare their reſolutions to his propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalls. This was done accordingly. And he was commanded to write unto the Divines of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance in <hi>Pruſsia,</hi> and to the Lord Chancellor <hi>Oxonſtiern,</hi> to teſtifie firſt the good inclination, and reſolution which the Clergy of <hi>England</hi> had, to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operate in due time towards ſo good a work. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that their Councell for the preſent was only this, that to prepare a way for future treaties, the Magiſtrates of both ſides ſhould inhibite rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling diſputes in the Pulpit, and put down the names of partiality, ſo farre as could be done, and not ſuffer any debatements to be taken up or fomented about matters of Ceremony in the form of publike worſhip.</p>
            <p>This he did, and after a good ſpace, when news came, that the Proteſtant Princes in <hi>Germany</hi> had
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41561:4"/>
leagued themſelves together for their mutuall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and that an amiable conference of their Divines had been holden with good ſucceſſe at <hi>Eeipzigh</hi> to compoſe the differences in Religion, Maſter <hi>Dury</hi> was permitted to go into <hi>Germany,</hi> that he might ſee how the Divines of all ſides might be diſpoſed towards a Conjunction of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells, and endeavours in the work.</p>
            <p>To make away for this purpoſe, he had before hand through, Sir <hi>Iames Spenſe</hi> Lord of <hi>Oreholm,</hi> and Generall to the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Nation, in the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Army, given notice to his Majeſty of <hi>Sweden,</hi> what his aime was in the buſineſſe of Reconcilement, and how it might be effected: Therefore when he came in the yeer 1631. into <hi>Germany,</hi> he found the King ſomewhat prepared, whom ſoon after the Battle fought at <hi>Leipzigh,</hi> he ſpoke withall at <hi>Wirts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg.</hi> His Majeſtie was pleaſed to give him large audience, and by conference received full infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of all thoſe deliberations, and particular wayes, whereby the work could be proſecuted, of which, the Sammlary resolution whereunto his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty gave aſſent, was this. That the Councell given by the Reverend Prelates of <hi>England</hi> was to be followed, for the inhibition of diſputes, and partiall names: and that as Maſter <hi>Dury</hi> did intend to labour with the Divines of the Reformed ſide to diſpoſe them, to joyn unanimouſly in the means, and wayes of amitie, ſo his Majeſty would recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the ſame endeavours to be undertaken, by ſome Divine of the Lutheran fide, who ſhould in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41561:4"/>
like manner work upon the reſt of their own party, and afterward when a fit preparation ſhould be found on both ſides, then His Majeſty did offer to give unto Maſter <hi>Dury</hi> his Letters of Publike Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation towards the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> and chiefly towards the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> and <hi>Landgrave</hi> of <hi>Heſſen,</hi> that with his and their concurrence, and the Help of forraine Divines, the buſineſſe might be brought to a ſolemn conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. This favourable reſolution being taken, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Dury</hi> dealt firſt with the Divines of <hi>Heſſen,</hi> then with thoſe of <hi>Hanaw,</hi> and of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and of <hi>Deuxpont,</hi> and of the <hi>Wetteraw,</hi> till he heard the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> was dead, which evill news, although they made a ſtop in ſome part of his reſolutions, yet they made him not leave the ſame, but altering a little his courſe, he procured from all the foreſaid Divines certain Letters and Declarations, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſome were inſcribed to my Lords Grace of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> ſome joyntly to him and to the Lord Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> whereby they ſhewed their ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous intention to labour for unity, with a deſire to be aſſiſted by the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whiles this was a doing Sir <hi>Robert Amſtruther</hi> arrived as Extraordinary Ambaſſador from his Majeſty to the Princes of <hi>Germany.</hi> With him Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Dury</hi> (having now gained the conſent of the Reformed party, and thinking it fit to deal with the Lutheran ſide alſo) went to the meeting of the Proteſtant States, which was appointed at <hi>Heile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bron</hi> to frame an Evangelicall League. There he
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41561:5"/>
made uſe of ſome Lutheran Stateſmen to inſinuate to the Divines of that ſide certain propoſitions, which made known unto them his purpoſe. This firſt motion was not without effect towards many and chiefly towards thoſe of <hi>Strasburg,</hi> and <hi>Norim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,</hi> and ſome in the land of <hi>Wurtenburg.</hi> The mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting being ended, and the League framed at <hi>Heile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brone,</hi> he returned from thence towards the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Franckfort,</hi> and dealt with two ſuperinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents Doctor <hi>Dunner</hi> who was ſet over <hi>Mentz,</hi> by the Lord Chancellor of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſering</hi> who had the inſpection of <hi>Darmſtat,</hi> and with the Senior Paſtor of the City of <hi>Franckfort,</hi> Doctor <hi>Tettelbach.</hi> All theſe were brought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend the work unto their Brethren, and in the mean time the Churches at <hi>Paris, Geneva, Metts, and the Vniverſity of Sedan</hi> ſent their anſwers (for Letters formerly had been written to them) wherein they aſſiſted Maſter <hi>Dury</hi> with Councell; Some alſo of the Lutheran ſide declared in like manner a forward zeal and inclination to the work, by certain Writes imparted to that effect unto him. Therefore when a larger opportunity to work more effectually upon all, was offered by another meeting of the Proteſtant States, which was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed at <hi>Franckfort,</hi> he thought good to make his intention known unto the convocated Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, and deſired their aſſiſtance to further the ſame, whereupon a reſolution was taken to this effect;</p>
            <p>``Whereas Maſter <hi>Dury</hi> having deſired of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41561:5"/>
Confederate Evangelicall States, permiſsion to treat with the Divines and Paſtors of their Churches concerning the meanes of Peace Eccleſiaſticall; Although the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors then preſent had not gotten any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular inſtructions concerning this matter from their Principalls, yet nevertheleſſe their opinion was, that if the Lord Chancellor <hi>Oxonſtiern</hi> would by his authority advance this matter, that their Maſters who wiſh from their hearts for this Unitie, will be ſo much the more ready with all their ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to give aſsiſtance thereunto, according to the beginning made at the Conference held at <hi>Leipzigh,</hi> whereunto the Lords States, who are now preſent, in like manner unaminouſly do <hi>compromitte.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having gotten this approbation of the Work, and recommendation thereof by the States unto the Lord Chancellor; and being much encouraged by the private promiſſes of aſſiſtance, which the ſeverall Ambaſſadors from all parts made unto him, he thought fit to write Letters to all the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran Vniverſities,</hi> and to thoſe of the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> to acquaint them with his purpoſe of ſeeking Unity in matters of Religion. Which being done when afterward another meeting was in agitation to be
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41561:6"/>
held at <hi>Erfurt</hi> in the Spring, he thought it fit (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was minded to return in the mean time for <hi>England</hi>) to move the Ambaſſadors of the <hi>Palatinate, of Brandenburg, of Deuxpont, and of Heſſen;</hi> in caſe that any meeting ſhould be held before he could come back again, that they would be pleaſed to ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves ſome courſe, how this matter might be proſecuted thereat, leſt ſo good begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings might be without effect. They conſented to this motion, and met to conſult about the matter. The effect of their reſolution was this, That they would labour, in caſe a meeting ſhould be called, to cauſe inſert in the Letters Invitatory this clauſe,</p>
            <p>``That every one of the Princes would be pleaſed to bring along with him a Divine or two, inſtructed and authorized by his Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, to give advice about the means of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing unitie, and compoſing differences in Religion; and if the States ſhould not meet there, that nevertheleſſe in time, and place convenient, ſome particular convocation of their own Divines ſhould be brought to paſſe, wherein theſe two points ſhould be put to deliberation.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Whether, yea, or no, the Acts of the laſt Conference held at <hi>Leipzigh,</hi> ſhould not be received by all the Churches, ſo farre as
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41561:6"/>
they contain an agreement of the Articles of the Confeſsion of <hi>Ausburg?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Whether, yea, or no, the heads where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a diſagreement may be yet remaining in that Conference, cannot admit of a Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation; if yea, what that Reconciliation may be; if no, then it is to be inquired, whether or no, thoſe remaining differences of opinion be of ſuch importance, that by reaſon of the ſame, a Schiſme ſhould be upheld betwixt the Churches.</p>
            <p>Theſe things the Ambaſſador, and Chancellor of the Elector of <hi>Brandinburg</hi> did take upon him to ſet forward by the means of his Prince. So then M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Dury</hi> went through <hi>Holland</hi> (where he ſaluted the chief Divines to whom he had written out of <hi>Franckfort,</hi> and ſome others of his acquaintance) and arrived at <hi>London</hi> about the end of the yeer, 1633. There he found D <hi>Laud,</hi> Lord Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> in his Predeceſſors place. Therefore the Letters and Declarations of forraign Churches and Divines were preſented to him, with a brief Narration of more particular proceeding. All was well liked, and reſolution agreed upon, that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Dury</hi> ſhould proceed, and return again into <hi>Germany,</hi> which that he might do with greater advantage to the work, he dealt before his departure with the Reverend Fathers in God, Doctor <hi>Morton,</hi> Lord Biſhop of <hi>Durham,</hi> Doctor <hi>Hall,</hi> Lord Biſhop of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Davenant,</hi> Lord Biſhop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> who gave him certain Theologicall declarations
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41561:7"/>
for the advancement of his purpoſe. To which ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, he alſo wrote into <hi>Ireland,</hi> to the Moſt Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Father in God, Doctor <hi>Vſher,</hi> Lord Archbiſhop of <hi>Armagh,</hi> and Primate of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and to the two Lord Biſhops of <hi>Kilmore</hi> and <hi>Ardach,</hi> who in like manner did afterward joyntly aſſiſt him with their advices to the ſame end. In the mean time let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were ſent alſo from <hi>Helvetia,</hi> and from <hi>Norim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,</hi> giving ſuch teſtimony of concurrence, as were fit to encourage him to proceed. For which cauſe alſo when he was ready to go back again into <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> my Lords Grace of <hi>Canterbury</hi> gave him in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the Letters which he had brought from the <hi>German</hi> Proteſtants of both ſides to him, two let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the one to be communicated unto the Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the other unto the <hi>Lutheran</hi> party, wherein he did acknowledge the receit of their Letters, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them to proceed in the good purpoſe which they had undertaken, he promiſed in due time his further cooperation therein. With theſe Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, together with a Recommendatory letter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Sir <hi>Rob. Amſtruther,</hi> who was then Ambaſſador for his Majeſty in <hi>Germany;</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Dury</hi> went from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> where he found Sir <hi>Robert</hi> wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a new Commiſſion to go for <hi>Franckfort;</hi> And whilſt his Lordſhip ſtayed, he took occaſion to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the chief Divines of that City in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtoriall meeting, with his negotiation, who having promiſed to joyn endeavours, he went from thence towards <hi>Franckfort,</hi> to a great and ſolemn meeting of the Proteſtant States, where he arrived in my Lord
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41561:7"/>
Ambaſſadors company in <hi>Iune</hi> 1634. There he dealt in particular, firſt with his beſt acquaintance, and then made a propoſition in generall to the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; thereupon the States were moved to depute out of every Colledge, ſome to take his buſineſſe into conſideration. Theſe came together, gave M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Dury</hi> audience, received informations of the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of this work, and peruſed ſeverall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claratory writings, which divers Univerſities and Divines of both ſides in <hi>Germany,</hi> as alſo out of <hi>Germany</hi> in forraine Churches, as <hi>England, France, Helvetia,</hi> and <hi>Tranſilvania</hi> had given to him, which moved them to take the matter into ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, and make a decree whereof the heads are theſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, ``That Maſter <hi>Dury</hi> having been heard by a ſolemn Committee, and the Writs which he produced, taken into conſideration by the reſt of the States, all of them with unanimous conſent, did judge his Work moſt laudable, moſt acceptable to God, and moſt neceſſary, and uſefull to his Church, yet ſeeing it was of great and weighty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, and that many of the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors had not received any inſtructions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about from their Maſters, therefore no finall reſolution could be taken by them at that preſent, but that they would faithfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41561:8"/>
and recommend theſe buſineſſes unto their Maſters to bring them to ſome effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all reſolution.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That others which had received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions from their Principalls, about the matter, had propoſed two wayes of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in the work, ſome thought it expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, that the manner of proceeding which Maſter <hi>Dury</hi> had ſuggeſted unto the States, ſhould be followed in bringing a Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of peaceable Divines to paſſe, that a Fundamentall agreement in points neceſſary for ſalvation, according to the Example of the Conference held at <hi>Leipzigb</hi> might be ſetled; And that to this effect, the States of the four Upper Circles ſhould give up unto the Prince Elector <hi>Palatine,</hi> their more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular advices towards the furthering of the matter, and that the Declarations of the two <hi>Saxon</hi> Circles ſhould be given up to the Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> and <hi>Brandinburg,</hi> who then ſhould agree amongſt themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the time and place of a Meeting, which might be named unto the reſt, and afterwards Invitatory Letters ſhould be ſent to forraine States and Princes to move them
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41561:8"/>
to ſend thither alſo ſome of their Divines. Thirdly, That others thought it no leſſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to proceed thus; Namely, that the Electors of <hi>Saxony</hi> and <hi>Brandinburg</hi> ſhould be intreated by the States, then met together, to reaſſume the amiable Conference, which was begun three yeers ago, betwixt their Divines, and thoſe of <hi>Caſſell,</hi> and to this effect that (if not ſooner, at leaſt then) when the Treaties of Peace Univerſall ſhould be ſet on foote, a meeting ſhould be appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, whereunto peaceable Divines on both ſides, both within, and out of the <hi>Empire</hi> ſhould be called: In which meeting this ſhould chiefly be aymed at, that an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould be made in a Common Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion of Faith containing all the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentalls of Religion neceſſary for Salvation, ſetting other points of Scholaſticall diſpute aſide.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That the Ambaſſadors who had no inſtructions did promiſe to relate unto their Principalls, their advices, and procure fit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions thereupon, which ſhould be ſent unto the Civill Electors, profeſsing the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:41561:9"/>Fifthly, Moreover, that it was fully conſented unto by ſome, and by ſome taken <hi>ad refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendum,</hi> that in the mean time all Chriſtian moderation was to be uſed on both ſides, aſwell in Preaching, as in Writing; leſt if this was not done, ſome hinderance might befall unto their Unitie, and being done by this means, the Civill Peace alſo might ſo much the more be advanced.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, That Prayers were to be conceived in the Churches of both ſides, to intreat Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God to bleſſe theſe attempts.</p>
            <p>This was made an Act the fourteenth day of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi> 1634. To which the ſeal of thoſe which had the direction of the meeting was applyed, and all the chief hands did ſubſcribe it.</p>
            <p>Of this Act, the Originall, ſealed and ſubſcribed, was given to Maſter <hi>Dury,</hi> to enable him to teſtifie authentically to other Churches, the reſolution of the Proteſtant States, that thereby all well-willers unto the work might be encouraged to continue in ſetting it forward. Upon this ground he went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain towards <hi>England</hi> through the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> where he informed the Divines of his acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and the Deputies of the <hi>Provinciall Synodes</hi> of things paſt at <hi>Frauckfort,</hi> and elſewhere in theſe conſultations, obliging them thereby to take the matter to heart. And when he arrived into <hi>England,</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:41561:9"/>
My Lords Grace of <hi>Canterbury</hi> being informed of all matters, did by Sir <hi>Thomas Roes</hi> procurement recommend him to the King, who was pleaſed in taking more particular notice of his perſon, and work, then in former time, to permit him ſtill to proceed. To which effect he went over again into <hi>Holland,</hi> with His Majeſties Letters of ſafe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct; with a teſtimoniall from my Lords Grace of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> bearing witneſſe that Maſter <hi>Dury</hi> had acquainted him with the ſucceſſe of his procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, that he went again out of <hi>England</hi> to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the ſame buſineſse, not only with his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but alſo with his approbation, and aſſurance that he would be ready in due time, to advance <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> holy deſires of Peace. He had alſo private Letters from Doctor <hi>Davenant</hi> Lord Biſhop of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisbury,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Hall</hi> Lord Biſhop of <hi>Exceſter,</hi> to ſome of the chief Divines of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> to move them, to concurre more effectually in theſe endeavours, then they had formerly done. Moreover, he had Letters from the Ambaſſador of the Lords States of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> reſiding at <hi>London</hi> unto the States both of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> Thus he ſet forth, and arrived at the <hi>Hague</hi> in <hi>Iuly,</hi> the yeer 1635. There he dealt firſt with the <hi>States of Holland,</hi> to induce them to recommend theſe thoughts unto their Provinciall Synod which was then begun. Afterward he went to thoſe of <hi>Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and appeared in their Claſsicall meetings held at <hi>Walcheren, Zirickzee, Tolen</hi> and <hi>Goes,</hi> then he dealt with the Univerſity of <hi>Leyden,</hi> and the <hi>Synods</hi> as
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:41561:10"/>
they came in order; namely, with that of <hi>North-Holland,</hi> and of <hi>Vtrecht,</hi> and with the <hi>French Synod</hi> in thoſe parts, from which Declarations were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, fit for the advancement of his purpoſe: When he had thus farre proceeded in <hi>Holland,</hi> and found that evill affected mindes towards Peace, raiſed ungrounded ſurmiſes againſt him, to ſtop the good inclinations of impartiall men, he uſed meanes to clear mens judgements, by cauſing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things to be Printed for the better information of all. And having underſtood that the Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor <hi>Oxonſtiern</hi> was to go from <hi>Germany</hi> into <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> where he hoped that his Lordſhip would do more then in <hi>Germany</hi> he was able to do. For the work of Peace, at the perſwaſion of ſome friends, he took a journey thitherward, where he arrived in <hi>Iune, Anno</hi> 1636. Nor was he altogether diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of his expectation. For the Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor coming thither favoured his work, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though his proceedings were ſlow, yet much reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie was found in them. For when a reſolution was taken to permit Maſter <hi>Dury</hi> to treat with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viaes of that Kingdome, four places were named <hi>Stockholm, Vbſall, Weſteroſe,</hi> and <hi>Strengneſe,</hi> to which he might addreſſe himſelf particularly, and lay open his intention, having therefore firſt dealt with thoſe of <hi>Stockholm,</hi> he had the Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors Letters to make way for him, at the other places: of which the <hi>Vniverſitie</hi> of <hi>Vbſall</hi> was the chief. There he had conference both Collegially and ſeverally with the Profeſſors of Divinitie,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41561:10"/>
who gave full aſſent unto his deſires, and ſet down theſe conditions, upon which they were ready to agree, and joyn with the reformed ſide.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1 ``<hi>That a full agreement ſhould be made in all the fundamentall Articles of faith.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2 <hi>That all errors overthrowing the foundation, or tending to overthrow the ſame, ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3 <hi>That in matters Ceremoniall and of indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, there ſhould be a mutuall toleration.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>4 <hi>That betwixt the parties united ſincerity and uprightneſſe ſhould be maintained, leſt ancient errors might be upheld under doubtful ſpeeches.</hi>

               </item>
            </list>
            <p>Theſe demands the reſt agreed unto, neither was any thing of moment added thereunto by any. Therefore being returned back again into <hi>Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holm,</hi> and having informed the <hi>Lords Regents</hi> of that which was paſt, thoughts were entertained about
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:41561:11"/>
the firſt, and the laſt of theſe conditions, as the chief of all the reſt, namely, concerning Fundamentall Articles of Faith, and the eſtabliſhment of Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall Government; Touching the firſt, namely, how to limitate the number of Fundamentalls, and diſtinguiſh the ſame from Not fundamentals, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Dury</hi> did impart a brief diſcourſe unto thoſe of <hi>Vb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall,</hi> to which they made no reply, as being loath to go too faſt, before they ſhould have the conſent of their Brethren; yet ſilently they aſſented there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. Concerning the ſecond, becauſe they then were, as even yet at this time, they are in delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to ſettle their Eccleſiaſticall Government, by Cannons, which they are about to make. Therefore both the Dean of the Faculty of Divinity at <hi>Vbſall,</hi> the Queens Tutor at <hi>Stockholm,</hi> and the Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor conferred ſeverall times with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Dury,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that matter, to know the Conſtitutions of the Chief Reformed Churches, wherein he laboured to give them ſatisfaction; and imparted alſo unto them the printed judgements of the Engliſh Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats, Doctor <hi>Morton,</hi> Doctor <hi>Davenant,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Hall,</hi> which beſides ſome other publike Treatiſes of the ſame nature, were communicated unto them. But the Lord Chancellor being deſirous to confer more particularly, and at leiſure, with Maſter <hi>Dury,</hi> about all matters belonging to the further advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of the work of pacification, took him along in his company and Coach towards <hi>Vbſall,</hi> in a Circuit which he made thitherward from <hi>Stockholm,</hi> tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row <hi>Strengneſe,</hi> and <hi>Weſteroſe.</hi> In this progreſſe the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41561:11"/>
the Biſhops of <hi>Strengneſe</hi> and <hi>Weſteroſe,</hi> were dealt withall the ſecond time. They ſetled good reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and laid grounds for conſtant future treaties; ſo far, that they had thoughts of ſending ſome bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy into <hi>England;</hi> Nevertheleſſe, before matters could be brought to full maturity, ſome of the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Lutherans</hi> hearing large reports of Maſter <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> proceeding in <hi>Sweden,</hi> and being moved with jealouſie that the <hi>Swedes</hi> would come to ſome pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Treaties, and therein to a Concluſion without them, did expoſtulate the matter, and by letters endeavoured to diſſwade them from all further en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining of his motions, by which means their ſpirits were troubled, and their reſolutions ſo clog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that from that time forward, they went hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily to work; yet Maſter <hi>Dury</hi> hoping to overcome all ſuch letts, did not leave the work, but laboured ſo much the more to engage them to it, by ſhewing wayes free from all exception, whereby the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences which they did ſtick at, might be compoſed. This he did firſt at <hi>Vbſall,</hi> and afterward at <hi>Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holm,</hi> in a meeting of the chief Clergy, which was commanded to deal with him, wherein he gave them ſatisfaction to all their demands, in a whole dayes conference inſtituted to that effect, ſo that they ſeemed to acquioſſe. And becauſe they had laid this as a main ground, That if a Fundamentall agreement could be found in the Doctrine of the Lords Supper, they would not much ſtand to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate other matters. Therefore not long after their conference, he offered to the Archbiſhop and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:41561:12"/>
of <hi>Vbſall,</hi> a learned and Patheticall Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which from the Univerſity of <hi>Aberdeine,</hi> and Miniſtry of <hi>Edinburg,</hi> was ſent unto him, to ſhew the fundamentall agreement of Proteſtants in that point. At this Declaration ſome ſmall excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were taken, in reſpect of certain forms of ſpeeches contained therein, which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Dury</hi> having fully explained, and thereby reſolved their doubts, thoſe of <hi>Vbſall</hi> did reſt ſatisfied, but ſome others there were, who, having ſet themſelves profeſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt the work, would, by no means, receive any content. For, the more humbly, and diſcreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it was offered unto them, the more they ſought to avoid it, and laboured by all means to cry down, and diſcredit the very purpoſe of agreement, leſt the good liking which the Lords Regents did ſhew thereunto, might take ſome reall effect, and work upon the ſpirits of the common Clergie, a good im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion to give way unto it: This their perverſneſſe being fully apparrant, moved M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Dury</hi> to deal in ſome kinde more ſtrictly with them, than other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe his inclination would have ſuffered him to do: yet at laſt, to avoid occaſions of ſtrife, he reſolved to depart from thence, and let the buſineſſe lie a while aſleep; but leſt ſome unconſcionable men might falſly traduce all his proceedings in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, as then already in his preſence they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to do, by miſinforming others, of his words and actions, and miſinterpreting, ſuſpiciouſly, his aim, he cauſed to print, (before he went away from thence) a Summary, and true Narrative, of all his
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:41561:12"/>
chief actions and propoſalls, which he offered to the Clergie of that Kingdom, met in a Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And afterward, to the end they ſhould have no juſt cauſe of falſe ſurmiſes, or pretext to traduce his intentions, he made a ſolemn Vow to binde himſelf to lawfull purpoſes and unblamable wayes of proceeding, which he put to Paper and preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Lord Chancellor to be imparted unto the chief of that Clergy. Theſe preventions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uſed, when he was reſolved to be gone, the Lords Regents were pleaſed, in the Queens Name, to give him a Declaration, and dimiſſory Letter, whereby his actions in <hi>Sweden</hi> were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, bearing witneſſe that Maſter <hi>Dury</hi> being come into <hi>Sweden</hi> to diſpoſe the minds of their Clergy unto the work of Peace Eccleſiaſticall, according to the grounds laid by the States of the Empire at <hi>Franckfort, Anno</hi> 1634. he had dealt by permiſsion and command of her Majeſty, with the chief Divines of that Kingdome; and although ſome difficulties were riſen, as in waightie matters is uſuall, yet that he had not omitted any thing which could ſerve for the taking away of the ſame. Thus he went from <hi>Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holm, Anno</hi> 1638. and came to <hi>Lubeck,</hi> there he had ſpeech with Doctor <hi>Hunnius,</hi> one of the chief Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines of thoſe quarters. Him he prepared to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the motion of Peace, which afterward ſhould
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41561:13"/>
be made unto him. From <hi>Lubeck</hi> he ſet forward to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Hamburg</hi> to meet Sir <hi>Thomas Roe</hi> who there was reſiding as Ambaſſador Extraordinary from His Majeſty of great <hi>Britaine</hi> towards the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and Princes of <hi>Germany.</hi> To him he gave attendance, all the while he ſtaid in thoſe parts, not leaving his former purpoſe, but rather uſing the advantage of his Lordſhips favourable counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
            <p>In this new period of the negotiation, he went ſlowly to work, firſt becauſe he looked towards the <hi>Swedes,</hi> how they would behave themſelves after his departure; Secondly, becauſe he waited for ſome overture to begin, and make ſome Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalls at the publike Treaties of Peace in <hi>Germany,</hi> which then was thought upon by reaſon of the Emperors Ambaſſador, who was come to thoſe parts, and the Mediators which did offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves towards that negotiation. But when thoſe Treaties were not likely to proceed, he went to <hi>Bremen,</hi> that he might acquaint the Divines of that place, with his former proceedings, and gain in time to come their aſſiſtance by way of Councell. Theſe were very cordiall in the buſineſſe, and entertaining him with all kindeneſſe, and liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie (which no <hi>Germans</hi> before them had done) ſuch encouragements, and declarations were given, as he could deſire both from the Clergy, and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate of that Citie. Then he proceeded towards the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> who was at <hi>Gluckſtad,</hi> There with the good liking and countenance of my Lord
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41561:13"/>
Ambaſſador, he acquainted the Lord Chancellor <hi>Ravent<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>low</hi> with his deſire to deal with the Clergy of <hi>Denmark.</hi> If His Majeſty would give him leave ſo to do. His Majeſty gave way to his demands, and was pleaſed to recommend certain Writs (which his Chancellor received from Maſter <hi>Dury</hi>) unto the conſideration of his Divines of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſitie of <hi>Coppenhagen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe gave their judgement, and advice concerning his negotiation, tending to ſhew their approbation of the purpoſe, their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Counſell, and Propoſalls in proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of it, and their willingneſſe to treate further about it, with Maſter <hi>Dury,</hi> if his Majeſty would give permiſsion thereunto.</p>
            <p>The King cauſed their judgement to be delivered to Maſter <hi>Dury;</hi> who thereupon did accept of the offer of their Treatie, and gave them a large An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to all their propoſitions containing divers overtures towards a conſtant progreſſe in a Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logicall way of Treatie. U<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>to this anſwer, by His Majeſties Command, they gave a further declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their judgement; whereunto Maſter <hi>Dury</hi> having replyed, and ſhewed His Majeſty a brief, and ready way to come to the purpoſe, the King was pleaſed to write unto my Lord Ambaſſador, to let him know that he thought it fit, Maſter <hi>Dury</hi> ſhould be more particularly authorized from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> before the matter could proceed betwixt him
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41561:14"/>
and his Divines to any iſſue. Whiles theſe matters were thus in agitation, Maſter <hi>Dury</hi> dealt alſo with the Magiſtrates, and Miniſtry of <hi>Hamburg,</hi> and <hi>Lubeck,</hi> and with the Moſt Reverend, and Moſt Illuſtrious Archbiſhop of <hi>Bremen,</hi> who gave him a reference to ſome chief Divines, who entertained his motions with very good liking, and gave him an anſwer to the ſame. In like manner he made Propoſalls to thoſe of <hi>Stode,</hi> who took the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mature conſideration, and promiſed to concurre with others in anſwering. At laſt he went to thoſe of <hi>Brunſwick,</hi> and <hi>Luneburg,</hi> where, with the ſingular favour of thoſe Princes, and by the moſt pious and peaceable inclinations of their Councellors, and chief Divines, towards the Work of Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilement, a ground was laid for a very effectuall progreſſe. For they have made the Work their own, undertaking to diſpoſe the reſt of the <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi> Churches, and Univerſities, unto a reall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence in it, that afterwards they may proceed with our Churches, joyntly, to a full concluſion.</p>
            <p>Duke <hi>Auguſtus</hi> of <hi>Brunſwick</hi> was the firſt to whom Maſter <hi>Dury</hi> made his addreſſe: this learned, and wiſe Prince, was pleaſed, in favour of the Work, not only to convocate his chief Divines, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point them, with ſome of his Councellors of State, to conferre Collegially, a whole day with Maſter <hi>Dury,</hi> but alſo to ſettle a reſolution, which his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines ſubſcribed, obliging themſelves thereby, to joyn in all the wayes of agreement, whereof they had conferred together; and moreover, to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:41561:14"/>
the matter to his Cozen Duke <hi>George,</hi> by a large, and moſt effectuall Letter.</p>
            <p>With this addreſſe he came to Duke <hi>George,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding at <hi>Hildeſheim,</hi> where he had no leſſe, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more favourable entertainment then he had gotten at <hi>Brunſwick.</hi> For, by an Act of Councell the chief Divines, who then were in place, were appointed to viſit and entertain him, till others that were ſent for ſhould come; And when the chief of them were come, Maſter <hi>Dury</hi> was lodged and entertained with him in one houſe, at the Princes charge, for the ſpace of fourteen dayes, that they together might ripen matters, and bring their thoughts to a head. Which being done, a Committee of ſome Councellors of State was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to give them publike audience in the Prince His name, to hear them confer upon the matter of agreement, to conſider their Councels, and joynt reſolutions, and to make relation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of unto the Prince, that by his authority, and Countenance, ſuch aſſiſtance might be given to the Work, in due time, as ſhould be thought expedient. All which being done, firſt, the Divines gave to Maſter <hi>Dury,</hi> a Theologicall Declaration, wherein they teſtified their agreement to all his Propoſalls, and then their more particular reſolutions, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the manner of proceeding which they would follow in the future advancement of the Work on their part, were alſo imparted unto him. The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance whereof was this.</p>
            <p>That Doctor <hi>Calixtus</hi> chief profeſſor of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:41561:15"/>
of <hi>Helmeſtat</hi> ſhould, by order of the Prince, put forth ſome Treaties, wherein the heads of matters in diſpute amongſt Proteſtants ſhould be handled Hiſtorically out of Antiquity, to ſhew what the Church of all ages hath beleeved there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and how, notwithſtanding ſome difference of opinion thereabout among the Ancient Fathers, Brotherly love was alwayes maintained. Theſe Treaties ſhould be thus improved; Firſt they ſhould be ſent unto the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Univerſities of <hi>Wittenberg, Leipzigh, Iena, Marpurg,</hi> and <hi>Roſtock,</hi> and alſo to thoſe of <hi>Brandenburg, Heſſen</hi> and <hi>Bremen,</hi> to move them to declare their judgements therein for mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall agreement. Then, at ſome fit occaſion ſome body ſhould go to <hi>Leipzigh</hi> and <hi>Wittenberg,</hi> and deal with the <hi>Saxon Electorall Profeſſors</hi> by word of mouth, to diſpoſe them to a full reſolution in this buſineſſe. To which effect alſo the Prince ſhould move the two Dukes of <hi>Saxon Weymar,</hi> Duke <hi>William,</hi> and Duke <hi>Erneſtus,</hi> who have long wiſhed for this Reconciliation, to cauſe their Univerſity of <hi>Iena</hi> to cooperate therein; And in proceſſe of time, when the buſineſſe ſhould be brought by this way of proceeding, to ſome conſiderable ripeneſſe, then it ſhould be required, that from great <hi>Britain,</hi> and elſewhere, ſome body might be joyned to Maſter <hi>Dury,</hi> and alſo from <hi>Germany</hi> ſome body ſhould go into <hi>England,</hi> and other parts, to ſpeak with the chief Divines of thoſe Churches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that when there ſhould be good hopes of bringing the matter to paſſe, then the Soveraign Princes and States of all ſides
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:41561:15"/>
ſhould be intreated to agree upon a meeting, to make ſome concluſion in the matter: for the good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe whereof, publike prayers ſhould be made with common conſent in all the Churches.</p>
            <p>Theſe reſolutions being taken, when the Prince himſelf had ſpoken to Maſter <hi>Dury,</hi> and given him aſſurance of his willingneſſe to ſet forward this purpoſe, he did diſmiſſe him with a recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Letter unto his brother, Duke <hi>Frederick,</hi> reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding at <hi>Zelle,</hi> who in like manner received Maſter <hi>Dury</hi> very kindely, and moved his Divines to confer with him. In this conference, when they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſatisfaction to ſome doubts which were propoſed, they gave conſent unto all which was concluded at <hi>Brunſwick</hi> and <hi>Hildeſheim.</hi> From <hi>Zelle</hi> he went to the free <hi>City of Luneburg,</hi> where he acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Miniſtery of the place with his Propoſalls made unto other Churches, that they might alſo take the ſame into their conſideration, and in due time, with conſent of their Protector, D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Frederick,</hi> reſolve what to do therein.</p>
            <p>Thus the Circuit of <hi>Brunſwick</hi> and <hi>Luneburg</hi> being finiſhed, he returned to <hi>Hamburgh</hi> in <hi>February,</hi> An. 1640. from whence without delay he went towards my Lord Ambaſſador, Sir <hi>Thomas Roe,</hi> who was at <hi>Gluckſtad,</hi> with the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> to give him account of all the paſſages of his proceedings. There he alſo dealt further with the Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, <hi>Detloff Raventlow,</hi> and the King himſelf was pleaſed, upon my Lord Ambaſſador his recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, to give him acceſſe to kiſſe his hand, and in
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:41561:16"/>
preſence of his Son, the Archbiſhop of <hi>Bremen,</hi> to ſpeak with him about the ſetting forward of his purpoſe. In which diſcourſe, his Majeſty ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a good liking to his proceedings, and gave way that, if he thought fit, he ſhould make new propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalls, touching means of Reconcilement, unto his Divines, that they might have further occaſion to entertain theſe thoughts as well as others. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Maſter <hi>Dury</hi> did impart unto the forenamed Lord Chancellor, a paper, containing certain heads, fit to be Theologically conſulted upon by them, that their reſolutions touching the ſame, might in due time be framed, and alſo made pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, if they themſelves thought it expedient. Thus the Treaties at <hi>Denmark</hi> being again ſet on foot, he returned from <hi>Gluckſtad</hi> with my Lord Ambaſſador towards <hi>Hamburg,</hi> and gave, by letters, informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into <hi>England,</hi> concerning all matters of moment, which paſſed in his work. Then alſo ſome writes, preſented formerly unto the Divines of <hi>Denmark,</hi> were made publike, that many who deſired to know the paſſages of that negotiation, might have ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction therein. Not long after, my Lord Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor was recalled from <hi>Germany</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> about which time the private diſputes amongſt thoſe of <hi>Bremen</hi> were come to ſome height: for thoſe that were moſt inclinable to moderation, ſuffering wrong, had ſought Maſter <hi>Duries</hi> advice, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his help to compoſe their doubtfull queſtions. Therefore he ſent to ſome of the Prelates of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and ſome of the Profeſſors of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:41561:16"/>
Divinity, in both Univerſities, certain Writs, which the chief Divines of <hi>Bremen</hi> ſubmitted unto their judgements, containing the true ſtate of their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, which reflecteth much upon the main con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie debated betwixt the reformed, and the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Divines; therefore the deciſion thereof, will be a ſingular preparative for the common and more publike Unity of all Proteſtants. To theſe Writes, the Lord Biſhops of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and of <hi>Exceter</hi> have already given their anſwers, and the reſt to whom they are ſent, have promiſed to do the like, who, no doubt, will be as good as their word; In the mean time Maſter <hi>Dury</hi> ripened, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, matters towards the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſmooth the knottineſſe of the Clergy of <hi>Hamburg</hi> and <hi>Lubeck.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, finding ſome warping of their intentions, which he perceived would bend another way then was expedient; he dealt firſt with Doctor <hi>Hunnius</hi> a leading man at <hi>Lubeck,</hi> and then with the Senior Preacher of <hi>Hamburg,</hi> that when theſe two ſhould be ſet in a right way, the leſſe-knowing and more clamorous Clergy might be more eaſily perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and wrought to admit the thoughts of mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. As for Doctor <hi>C. lixtus,</hi> although ſome men of ſtrife, and evill willers to him, did undertake to diſturb him in theſe peaceable thoughts, yet being ſtrongly countenanced, by Superiors, he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to perform his promiſe, giving Maſter <hi>Dury</hi> full aſſurance of his conſtancy, and of the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of many others towards the furtherance of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:41561:17"/>
the ſame Councells. And becauſe the oppoſition made againſt Doctor <hi>Calixtus,</hi> by his Brethren, was like unto that which the chief Profeſſors of <hi>Bremen</hi> ſuffered by their Brethren, Maſter <hi>Dury</hi> conceived that the ſimilitude of their caſes, might be a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to induce them to mutuall correſpondency, in the work of Reconcilement. Therefore having gotten the Originall Writes which Biſhop <hi>Dave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Hall</hi> ſent to thoſe of <hi>Bremen,</hi> he went thither, to deliver the ſame, and conferre with them about the matter, whereunto he found them exceeding well inclined. In the way going thither, he dealt with one <hi>Statius Buſcherus,</hi> Doctor <hi>Calixtus</hi> his chief oppoſer, endeavouring to mollifie and withdraw him from ſome prepoſterous cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: and coming back again, he ſtayed a whole day at <hi>Bremervorde,</hi> the Reſidence of the Moſt Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Reverend Archbiſhop of <hi>Bremen,</hi> with whom he had twice occaſion of large conference, tending to give him ſatisfaction (which he alſo received) concerning ſome doubts, which he had conceived of the Work. From thence paſſing through <hi>Stade,</hi> and having inſinuated unto the chief Preacher of that place M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Haveman</hi> ſome writes tending to Pacification, he arrived at <hi>Buxtehude,</hi> where he met with Maſter <hi>Scholvinus</hi> the Paſtor of the place, a learned and moderate <hi>Lutheran</hi> Divine, whom he confirmed in a courſe of conference, and correſpondency, begun with Doctor <hi>Bergius</hi> at <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> towards the ripening of matters belonging to Pacification.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:41561:17"/>Then being come back to <hi>Hamburg</hi> he made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ready to return for <hi>England:</hi> And to this effect took his leave of the Magiſtrat, and Miniſtry of that place: ſome of the Magiſtrate were very earneſt with him to perſevere in the proſecuting of his work, and the Miniſtery gave him their anſwer in Writ, ſhewing that they were willing to proceed; firſt by way of private correſpondency in writing, and then by way of publike meeting, when things ſhould be ripened. Before he went from <hi>Hamburg</hi> he ſent by Sea to the chief Prelates, who in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> had aſſiſted him, a Treatiſe, which Doctor <hi>Calixtus</hi> of <hi>Helmſtat,</hi> had written in behalf of the work, that they might declare their judgement unto him concerning the ſame. Then he paſſed again through <hi>Buxtehude,</hi> and <hi>Stade,</hi> where he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed Maſter <hi>Haveman</hi> and <hi>Scholvinus,</hi> in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions to moderation, and dealt again with <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Buſcherus,</hi> to take off the edge of his ſpirit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Doctor <hi>Calixtus.</hi> At <hi>Bremen</hi> he ſtayed four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen dayes, to print an Information directed to all the Reformed Churches, concerning the Councels of Peace, whereunto the <hi>Lutheran</hi> ſide doth give way, that if the ſame finde on the Reformed ſide in like manner approbation, the buſineſſe may be in due time ſet forward by publike authority. From <hi>Bremen</hi> he went to <hi>Oldenburg,</hi> where he dealt with the Superintendent of that place, and by his means preſented to the Earl of <hi>Oldenburg,</hi> that which was fit to give him information of his work. From thence he came to <hi>Embden,</hi> where he ſtayed certain
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41561:18"/>
dayes, to inſinuate the printed Information unto the Divines, both of the Citie, and of the County. At <hi>Groningen</hi> he did the like: from whence coming to <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> he conferred with the chief Divines of his acquaintance there, and ſent to all the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries (which they call <hi>Claſſes</hi>) of <hi>North-Holland,</hi> and neighbouring parts; ſo many copies of the printed Information, with adjoyned letters, as were requiſite to be imparted unto them. From the <hi>Hague</hi> he did the like unto all the <hi>Presbyteries of South-Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and Zealand,</hi> and of the neighboring places, as alſo to the <hi>Synods</hi> which are to be held in every Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince. Thus having given ſatisfaction to the chief of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> and uſed means to ſend infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation from <hi>Amſterdam</hi> into <hi>Helvetia,</hi> and from the <hi>Hague</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> he came to <hi>Zealand,</hi> and took Shipping for <hi>England:</hi> Where he ſafe arrived, and purpoſeth to make ſute now unto all thoſe that are able to give aſſiſtance unto ſo good a buſineſſe, but chiefly to ſupplicate his Sacred Majeſty, and the High and Honorable Court of Parliament, that thoſe good preparatives, and hopefull beginnings, ſo far, and with ſo much pains advanced, may not be ſuffered to fall, without profit, unto the ground, through want of all outward countenance, and help neceſſary to uphold ſuch a Spirituall Agency. All parties have been dealt withall, their diſpoſitions are ſufficiently tryed and diſcovered, their Leaders are all ingaged to concurre, neither hath any of the forraign Churches taken offence at the carriage of the work: but every where, the Princes and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:41561:18"/>
of State have profeſſed a great deal of liking thereunto. Therefore it ought to be kept afoot, and upheld in the ſpirits of men for many pregnant reaſons, which elſewhere are alleadged more at large: But now we will mention onely this, that as we are bound in Conſcience, at all times to maintain the care of Brotherly love, and holy Communion, in Spirituall things, ſo now, at this time, we finde it abſolutely neceſſary, even for our own temporall ſafety ſo to do, becauſe if this care be not taken to heart, it is moſt certain, that the breaches of Proteſtant States and Churches, which have made many of them a prey unto their enemies, will, in the end, betray them all, and at laſt come to ſuch a height, that they will devour and conſume one another. Therefore all true-hearted Proteſtants, that are zealous for Gods glory, and the ſafety of his Church, but chiefly thoſe that are in authority, or credit, able to diſpoſe others; are humbly intreated to embrace theſe thoughts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out partiality, conſidering the Apoſtles exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 4. That every one ſhould not look on his own things, to ſeek himſelf alone, But, that he ſhould alſo lay to heart the things of others, and chiefly ſuch as may tend moſt unto publike edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. For if we be commanded every one of us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 2. to pleaſe our Neighbour for his good to edification: then ſurely we ought farre more to labour to pleaſe all, in that which is beſt. And if every one ought to do this, then moſt of all thoſe that are eminent in place, and in credit with others:
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41561:19"/>
For to whom doth this duty rather belong, than unto ſuch. As then the work ought not either to be agitated without the knowledge and conſent of Superiors in Church and Common-wealth, or to be publikely afoot without their authority, ſo they are called and appointed to be Builders of the houſe of God, before all others, and this is the cauſe why thus we ſue unto them, and would have all ſuch as love the well-fare of <hi>Sion,</hi> to ſecond our ſuit. For what can be conceived more uſefull to the Church of God at any time, than the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels of Peace are at this time? Nay, what is more neceſſary to prevent all manner of confuſions, and diſorders now growing upon all the Churches, than this endeavour is? Therefore again and again, all men of gifts ought to be entreated, for the love which Chriſtians ſhould bear unto Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus their Saviour, for the reſpects due unto the Commandements of God, for the comfort which the Goſpell of Truth is able to yeeld unto their own ſouls, for the bowels of Compaſſion, which they ought to bear unto the afflicted Church of Chriſt (their Spirituall Mother) and for the fear of Gods dreadfull Indignation, and ſtretched out hand, now ready to fall upon thoſe, that preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly deſpiſe, and careleſly neglect his expreſſe Commandements: I ſay, that all men of gifts, for theſe cauſes ought to ſet their hearts upon the Councells of Peace, and imploy their Talents for mutuall edification, in ſhewing the means of Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly love, of meekneſſe, of righteouſneſſe, of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:41561:19"/>
of mercy, and moderation, for the enlarging of the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt, whoſe love doth conſtrain us to propoſe, in this manner, theſe things without all humane reſpects, and maketh us earneſt with freedom (as not being aſhamed of our duty) to preſſe the matter thus home, upon the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of every one in his diſtinct charge and place, that at leaſt, ſuch as have any feeling of godlineſſe, and know what the power of Religion requireth in our publike Profeſſion, ſhould not want ſome Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall provocation, and awaking of their hearts towards the performance of that, which is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Communion of Saints.</p>
