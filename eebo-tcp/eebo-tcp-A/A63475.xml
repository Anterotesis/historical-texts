            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Redagh</hi> was relieved on Tueſday night laſt by the two Pinnaces ſent from hence, and in happy time, for they were almoſt at their laſt morſell: The Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces enjoyed ſo faire a winde and ſo full a ſpring-tide, that the Rebels could not poſsibly prevent their comming in. That night, in conjecture that the Defendants within the Town, would be overjoyed with their new reliefe, Captain <hi>Fox</hi> undermined a part of the wall which was moſt weak, which Sir <hi>Henry Tichbourn</hi> beheld all the time of their work, untill the breach was made and two hundred entred; and when as Sir <hi>Henry</hi> perceived as many as he could maſter, he fell upon them and cut off all but eight men, who hardly eſcaped; their Captain was killed, many were ſlaine the day after.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philip O-Reyley,</hi> an Arch-Rebell, and a man very mightie amongſt them, is taken and hanged.</p>
            <p>The Lord of <hi>Dungarvon,</hi> hath brought in Armes for five hundred foot, and one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty horſe out of <hi>England</hi> into <hi>Youghall,</hi> and twenty Barrells of powder, part whereof is ſent to <hi>Duncanvon,</hi> to the aid of the Lord of <hi>Eſmond,</hi> who is beſeiged, and ſuſpected for a Rebell: That Fort is well ſtored with braſſe Ordnance, and like to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the greater loſſe.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Dungarvon,</hi> the Lord <hi>Braughill,</hi> and Sir <hi>William Courtney,</hi> with a convenient Force, adjoyned to the Lord Preſident of <hi>Mounſter,</hi> who hath fifteene hundred foot, and foure hundred horſe at command, ſo as if the Lord the Lord <hi>Roch</hi> ſtand firme, that yet ſtirre not, there will bee no feare of the Rebels in that Province.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Philip O-Neale,</hi> on Tueſday night came to <hi>Tredagh</hi> with one thouſand foot, and two hundred horſe.</p>
            <p>Our numbers yet are ſo few, till further aid out of <hi>England,</hi> that it will be hazardous to adventure any part thereof, unleſſe upon certain ground and good advantages; for if wee ſhould receive a blow, the whole Kingdome might be endangered.</p>
            <p>The Townes neere the Mountaines, where <hi>Luke O-Toole</hi> and others kept their rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, are all ſackt and burnt: they flie at the voyce of an Army in divers places. God granting peace in <hi>England,</hi> there is no feare of Warre in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
