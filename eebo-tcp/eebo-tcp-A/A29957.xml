         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>MAy it pleaſe thee, at this time, to receive a free and true Diſcourſe of ſundry and main occurrences of buſineſſes, here amongst us, tendred unto thee by a reall Friend, and faithfull Servant of thine, in the Lord; who makes it a good part of his earneſt ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, to enquire in all ſeriouſneſſe after the truth of thoſe things, which thus buſie us all in theſe miſerable dayes of ours, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where; (what in thoughts, what in words, what in deeds) with the motives, occaſions, reaſons, and ends thereof) and this forſooth not to content his vain curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, and meerely to feed his empty brains with notions; as many read Books and bearken after news; but, for the good of the Publike, unto the Service whereof, he freely and cheerfully devotes his pains and
<pb facs="tcp:56773:3"/>
labours; and ſo with pleaſure, he, in all freedom of heart, imparts unto others, of what he jugeth to be true, and conducing to the good of Church and State, without unjuſt partiality, or baſe ſiding with any faction, the great diſeaſe in theſe our evil dayes, of fooliſh and weak men: And the principall occaſion of thoſe our great and long ſufferings, with the tedious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays, and many hinderances of carrying on the publike Work, by action in the Field, and Counſell at home, to the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of Church and State. This he doeth, without regard to the perſons of any who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, having no intent to offend the leaſt by cynicall mordacitie, nor mind to curry favour with the greateſt, by inſinuating flattery, being (by Gods great mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, unworthy worm) pretty free from the chief cauſe of theſe diſtempers, ordinary to moſt men: For, on the one part, he knows no man who hath ſo far wronged him, in his own particular, as to move him unto anger or wrath againſt the perſon of any; and he hath ever thought it contrary to good Chriſtianity, and diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant from morall honeſty, to inveigh ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilouſly
<pb facs="tcp:56773:3"/>
againſt mens perſons, as Pamphle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers do now adayes.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, he ſpeaketh of the failings in divers kindes and degrees, wherewith he is highly offended, and much ſcandali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, of men of all ranks and conditions in both Kingdoms, without deſignation of their perſons by name: Yea, he is ſo far from naming any man in particular, for his errors, that he makes mention but of a very few by name, and thoſe with eloge and praiſe, wiſhing from his heart that he had juſt occaſion to name all thoſe to their advantage, at whoſe faults he points at.</p>
            <p>Further, he heartily bleſſeth God, who in his Fatherly care towards him hitherto, (and he hopes will do ſo to the end, being aſſured that he, who giveth the principall, will not deny the acceſſory, if he thinks it fit for his own Glory and our good) hath provided for him wherewith to ſuſtain his nature, without great exceſſe or much want, and hath ſchooled him both by precept and practice, to live and be content of little, and ſo, not being ſo urged by a neer nip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping neceſsity, or imaginary poverty, as to
<pb facs="tcp:56773:4"/>
ſelt or betray the Truth for a morſell of Bread, nor ſo led away with the exorbitant deſire of preferment or profit, as to cog in upon any terms by flattery, lying, and fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with thoſe, in whoſe hands, for the preſent, the diſturbation of ſuch things is amongſt us now adayes; He dare be bold to ſpeak home to the Point, and tell down-right the truth of things wherein the Church and State are ſo much concerned, not fearing to be croſſed in his private intereſt, and put back from his hopes, by diſpleaſing the gods.</p>
            <p>Moreover, he preferreth the poſſeſsing of himſelf with calm and freedom of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, having his little <hi>viaticum,</hi> ſuch as it is, ſimple and courſe, to the gliſtering ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, with toiling and moiling of ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and covetous ones; to whatſoever hight with luſtre and fair ſhew they attain unto, in the eyes of the World, and opinion of men, knowing that it is dear bought, with loſſe of time, and often of credit and conſcience, and to be nothing but a meer ſhadow, which in a moment vaniſheth.</p>
            <p>To the performance of this uſefull and neceſſary Duty, he conceiveth himſelf
<pb facs="tcp:56773:4"/>
bound in conſcience, before God and man, for theſe reſpects and reaſons;</p>
            <p>Firſt, Every one of us all, in our ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ranks and ſtations, ought, ſo far as in us lyeth, advance the Glory of God, and hinder whatſoever is contrary to it, or againſt it; for, he is the Lord our God: Then being bound to the hearty Love of our Neighbour, we ought with earneſtneſſe procure his true good, and hinder him from receiving evil, or committing ſin whereby evil may come upon him: This is inculcate in the Scripture over and over again; Yea, we are bidden rebuke our Brother, or Neighbour, plainly, when he ſinneth, in any kinde: otherwiſe we are ſaid to be haters of him; namely, we are to hinder him from walking about with lyes among the people, and from conſpire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the wicked. Read <hi>Levit. 19. 16, 17.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next, The Church whereof we are Children, and the Countrey whereof we are Members, requireth and expecteth of us all, that with our whole power and might, we procure, in all uprightneſſe and ſingleneſſe of heart, their true good, and
<pb facs="tcp:56773:5"/>
ſtop whatſoever appears to be againſt the ſame, either word or deed; thoughts being onely known to God. To this we are not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bound at once, by a generall tye; but we iterate and renew it from time to time, as we receive benefits by them, or from them, according to the ordinary practice of us all.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Are we not all obliged by our late Nationall Covenant, and ſworn, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the ſetling of the Church-Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, according to the Word of God, and conforme to the beſt Reformed Churches, and to the ſetling of a ſolid Peace to the good of the People, by putting forward the Service, and oppoſing the open and declared Enemy, with the crafty Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, of whatſoever kinde, ſecretly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermining us in the purſuance of this our good Cauſe, by cabales, factions, lyes, deviſes, and plots, and with whatſoever elſe the wicked heart of man full of wyles for his own and his Neighbours ruine. All thoſe tyes and bonds are ſhaken off and broken by the moſt part of us, either through negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent lazineſſe, and remiſſe ſlackneſſe, not minding them, and not having before
<pb facs="tcp:56773:5"/>
our eyes as we ought the leaſt part of our duty; or through baſe connivence and treacherous compliance to the wicked courſes of the Enemies againſt the Cauſe, we ſay we maintain, I am ſure at leaſt we ought; or by open and profeſſed Apoſtaſie, we have joyned our hearts and affection with the Common Enemy, who ſo actively by all means oppoſeth this Cauſe of God, and perſecuteth his people for it.</p>
            <p>This is done both in <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> not by a few, but by many; not by little and ſmall ones, but by the Chief and Leaders of the rest; not by ſtopping things of humane infirmity and weakneſſe, but with ſtudy and an high hand.</p>
            <p>Here we ſhall ſay a word or two of the carriage of thoſe two Nations, in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on with the Work of the Lord, for the ſetling of the Church, and quiet of his People. We ſhall begin at thoſe of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> who ſome few yeers ago were lifted up with praiſes among men, for their faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full minding and following earneſtly this great Work of God, all by-ends laid aſide, for which God bleſſed them from Heaven,
<pb facs="tcp:56773:6"/>
and made them be called happy among men; for they had their hearts deſire in the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and their Enemies were ſubdued by them: But now, leaving off their former integrity and ſincerity to the Cauſe of God, and their Love unto him, following the devices and deſires of their own corrupt hearts, in pride, coveteouſneſſe, and factions, &amp; notwitſtanding the earneſt and preſsing admonitions, both in private and publike, of the Prophets and Miniſters of God, they continue in their evil courſes, preposterouſly minding themſelves, and their worldly fooliſh intereſt of ambition and avarice, more then God, and the Cauſe of his Church and people. For this, God (as it were by an eſſay to try them if they would, laying aſide their lewd by wayes, mind him and his Service heartily and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerly) ſends amongst them an hand-full of contemptible, profane, and wicked villains; whom, at firſt, they deſpiſe and neglect; but, going on in their wonted wayes, while the holy Name of God is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faned by thoſe Sons of <hi>Belial,</hi> a part of their Land is waſted, the poor people ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and ſlain, with all other barbarous
<pb facs="tcp:56773:6"/>
uſage; and ſo theſe number and power of the Slaves of Iniquity growing, they are plotting, caballing, and deviſing how to ſupplant another, and increaſe their ſever all faction, the ſeed of diſſenſion being ſowed amongst them by the Enemy, to divide, and ſo more eaſily compaſſe his ends upon them, which they would not and could not ſee, blinded with their corrupt paſsion. Then God, to admoniſh them anew, ſuffers ſome of thoſe, whom they had employed againſt the Sons of Rebellion, to betray their truſt, and omit divers good occaſions, in all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, to make havock of theſe villains, yea, ſome to run over unto them in the hour of fight: and ſo, theſe Enemies of goodneſſe, to advance their pernicious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, do what they liſt.</p>
            <p>Yet, all this will not die with thoſe hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted and ſtubbling men, ſtill employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and buſying their thoughts how to bear down one another; yea, ſome there were amongst them, who were not ſorry in their hearts, of the progreſſe that thoſe deſpiſable villains made in the Countrey againſt the Service of the Common Cauſe, conceiving it did help to the ſetting up of their faction.
<pb facs="tcp:56773:7"/>
But, ſince the affronts and blows, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived at divers times from thoſe contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible fellows, did not move theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grate Children, God ſends a Peſtilence amongst them, which rageth with ſuch fury, that hardly the like hath been heard of in that Land; to try if at laſt they would leave their ſlacknes &amp; remiſſenes in purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Service of the Cauſe of Gods Church and People, their conniving and comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his Enemies, yea, their helping thoſe villains with means and advice, in oppoſing the Cauſe of God and oppreſsing his People. But, they remain obdured, like Children of diſobedience, in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe wayes. So, at length, God in his wrath delivers them up to the hands of their wicked Enemies, making them as far to be ſcorned and miſpriſed, for their not heartly minding him &amp; his Service, as they had been before eſteemed and extolled, for their adhering to him, and doing his Service faithfully. Yea, the Chief men of them, who had been cried up for Valour and Wiſdom, are conſtrained to flie away, and have their lives for a prey.</p>
            <p>So God, who from the beginning of all
<pb facs="tcp:56773:7"/>
thoſe unhappy diſturbances, till this laſt time, had made <hi>Scotland</hi> a Mirrour of his Mercy, in teſtimony of its faithfulneſſe, adhering unto him; makes it an example of his Juſtice for its back ſliding from him. And thus, Judgement begins at the Houſe of God; now let <hi>England</hi> look ſeriouſly to it; for the ſame very ſins, which have been committed in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and for which it now lieth under the heavy rod of a chaſtiſing and angry God; are now raigning in <hi>England,</hi> namely, ambition and avarice, with many more, which have not been ſeen in <hi>Scotland;</hi> example, he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, errors, and Sects of all ſorts, to the diſhonour of God, and to the withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the People from his Truth, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nived at and countenanced by thoſe who are in Authority.</p>
            <p>Then, there be ſome of power and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, who are ſo far from furthering the Reformation of the Church (as they and we all are ſworn to by the Covenant) that they hinder the ſame, not onely by ſecret undermining, and by plots; but by a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued open profeſsion againſt it.</p>
            <p>Next, There be great oppreſsions, vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb facs="tcp:56773:8"/>
concuſsions, and injuſtices done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the People, by divers in Authority; the cry of all which, is as loud if not louder unto Heaven then the cry of the ſins of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> It may be that God, as he hath not be gun ſo ſoon to ſhew his Mercy unto <hi>England</hi> as he did unto <hi>Scotland,</hi> will not ſend his Judgement upon it ſo ſpeedily; yet, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, without a ſerious Repentance and a true turning unto God, Judgement will come, and the longer it is a coming, the heavier it will be.</p>
            <p>It is not the good Cauſe of Church and State that will do <hi>Englands</hi> turn, more then the Temple and the Law of old did ſave <hi>Judah</hi> from ruine; nor the ſame good Cauſe hath kept <hi>Scotland</hi> from puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the good Cauſe ill managed, by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence, ambition, avarice, faction, ſelf-conceit, and other vices of that kinde, draweth vengeance upon thoſe who have the managing of it, and make the Cauſe to be in deriſion. Never good Cauſe hath been worſe managed by the ignorance of weak ones, and the malice of other wicked.</p>
            <p>At laſt, God will maintain his Cauſe, (no thanks to thee) without thee, for he
<pb facs="tcp:56773:8"/>
needs not thy help to do it; but, ſince he hath been pleaſed to make uſe of thee in the Service of this his Cauſe, he expects faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe and zeal to it from thee, free from worldly and humane intereſt: Otherwayes vengeance is at thy door; for God, as he will not, in his Worſhip and Cult, have linſey-wolſey of mens inventions intermin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with his pure and ſacred Ordinance, ſo he will not, in managing the Service of his Cauſe and of his People, that men bring in the mixture or addition of their own intereſt; for God will have our work wholly for himſelf; and if we be faithfull in it, he will not forget to give us what we need to have for our ſelves; otherwayes he will not onely caſt us off and our work, but will curſe both it and us.</p>
            <p>Again I ſay, Let <hi>England</hi> take ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample at her Neighbour; yet I am ſure God in his Judgement will remember his Mercy unto <hi>Scotland,</hi> and for his own Name ſake will keep his promiſe unto his faithfull ones, whereof he hath a great number of all ranks and conditions in that diſtreſſed Countrey, and will not ſuffer this proud inſulting Enemy to domineer thus
<pb facs="tcp:56773:9"/>
ever his poor people, far leſſe ſet up again his abominations and profane his holy Name; but God will ariſe and throw his Enemies to the duſt, for it is againſt him they fight, and for his ſake they thus trouble, vex, &amp; now oppreſſe his People. And although that all men, at this great laſt blow, were ſtruken with aſtoniſhment, yet many take courage to go on with the Service of the Cauſe of God, with their whole heart and ſtrength, acknowledging Gods Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice in this his thus chaſtiſing them, and confeſſing heartily their ſins by which they have ſo provoked God to anger, and are truly ſorry, not ſo much for their ſufferings they now lie under, as for their offending their good God, on whom they are reſolved to rely, and in whom they will conſtantly truſt, and to whom they will more neerly adhere then ever; let him deal with them as he pleaſeth, they are the Servants, he is the Lord, they are the Pot, he is the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they are the Creatures, and he is the Creator, whoſe will is alwayes good, not onely it ſelf, but for us, if we be obedient and faithfull unto him. But, I will hold thee here no longer. So recommending thee to God, I go to the Diſcourſe it ſelf.</p>

            <head>A ſhort and true Relation of divers paſſages of things, wherein the <hi>Scots</hi> are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly concerned, from the firſt beginning of theſe troubles, to this day.</head>
            <p>IT is not unknown to men of underſtanding; how that, many ſiniſtrous reports, one after an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, raiſed of the <hi>Scots</hi> (for their faithfulneſſe &amp; conſtancy to the Cauſe of Religion and Liberty, in theſe Dominons) by Malignants, that is, by Atheiſts, Libertines, Papiſts, Prelatiſts, and Sectaries of all kindes, officiating in their ſeverall wayes for the Common Enemy, and ſpred abroad by the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers thereof, with the help of their inſtruments, Agents, and Favourers; then received by the ſimpler ſort, not knowing the truth of things, leſſe the drift of the Malignants, in theſe calumnies; otherwayes well-meaning people, (for the truth is no ſooner made known unto them, but they willingly lay hold on it; and being admoniſhed of the perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious deſigne of the adverſaries, they do abhorre and deteſt both it and them:) hath done, and yet doeth
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56773:10"/>
great prejudice, according to the intent of the Enemy, unto the ſervice now in hand, of the Common Cauſe of Church and State, theſe two inſeparable twins, which both Kingdoms do now maintain, and intend to do unanimouſly with heart and hand, as they ſtand bound and united to lay aſide all other and former tyes, by the Nationall Covenant, through the great Providence of God, in mercy to both, ſo that they prove faithfull and conſtant to this Cauſe of his and of his people, according to the ſaid Covenant, againſt all oppoſition whatſoever, whether by decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and open war, or by clandeſtine and indirect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermining.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, after long forbearance with grief of mind, and compaſſion to ſee faithfull men and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt in this Common Cauſe, ſo maliciouſly traduced, and, in them, the good Cauſe ſo much wronged; as likewiſe, ſo many well-affected men to the ſaid Cauſe, ſo groſly abuſed by crafty lyes, and impudent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths: I have thought fit, for the good and ſervice of the Common Cauſe, to the advancement whereof, every one is obliged to contribute according to what he hath, as he will anſwer one day to him, whoſe Cauſe firſt and principally it is, to undeceive many well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded men, and to right, in ſome meaſure, thoſe faithfull men to the Cauſe, who are ſo wickedly ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, in giving unto the publike this true and ſhort Diſcours; whereby the truth of divers things will be made more known, lyes in a kind repreſſed, and the ſervice of the Common Cauſe ſomewhat furthered; at leaſt it will not be ſo far kept back, as it hath hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto been by theſe undermining courſes.</p>
            <p>And the rather do I undertake this task, that thoſe in a manner are ſilent, by whom moſt men do expect the clear truth of things of this kinde not ſo generally known, ſhould be conveyed to all by a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56773:10"/>
publication of them in writing, to the end that this courſe of ſo maliciouſly lying againſt truſty men may be ſtopped, and the well meaning men no longer thus abuſed. But theſe, of whom men look for performance of this duty, going about the main work they are come hither for in all earneſtneſſe, and ſingleneſſe of heart, with care and diligence, and not without a great deal of drudging to and from, as faithfull and truſty labourers, do take but little no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of this wicked practiſe of their and the cauſe its Enemies, by lyes, howſoever induſtriouſly deviſed, and cunningly ſet forth, as altogether below them, choſing rather that their own good carriage, with conſtant reſolution, and faithfull endeavours, and that of their Country-men engaged with them in the ſame buſineſſe, although in another way, in ſincerity of heart, advancing the publike work now in hand, ſhould ſpeak for them both, then either a flouriſhing tongue, or a nimble pen.</p>
            <p>Here, although I value much the goodneſſe of theſe men to relye rather upon their own &amp; their Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens honeſty and integrity, in and about the work, then upon the ſetting forth of any Declaration, by writing of their own and their friends faithfull pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, and fair carrying on of things, in the publike ſervice: Yet, in this I cannot eſteem their pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; for, albeit native beauty ought not to be ſet forth by painting and patches, being compleat in it ſelf; yet it muſt be kept free from ſpots and and dirt, and made ſeen unto all, under a modeſt and comely dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, by which means it is more pleaſing and better liked of every one.</p>
            <p>And although where there is no fault, no Apologie ought to be made, yet, to make the truth openly known, (when it is deſguiſed) for the information of thoſe who take things meerly upon truſt, and to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56773:11"/>
ſtop the going on of wicked men with lyes, is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an Act of Wiſdom, but of Piety, yea, of Neceſſity, if men will not abandon the intereſt of a good cauſe to the malice of the Enemies thereof: and, as it is ſaid by the wiſe man, <hi>Thou art not to anſwer a fool according to his folly,</hi> that is, in exorbitancy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> leſt in ſo doing thou become like unto him; even ſo by the ſame wiſe man thou art ordained to anſwer a fool as is fit and convenient, for the repreſſing of his folly, leſt he think himſelf wiſe, and ſo go on in his evil courſe, to the diſhonour of God the Father of truth, and to the prejudice of both Church and State, who are to be directed by the truth. Surely, if ever at any time the lye and calumny of the fool (for ſo I call the calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niator, how cunningly ſoever he lyeth) is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with a fit anſwer, it is at this time, when there lieth ſo much at the ſtake in both Kingdoms, as Religion and Libertie, with whatſoever elſe is, or ought to be dear unto men.</p>
            <p>Now then, to anſwer unto the calumnies of thoſe Malignants, &amp; to make the ſimple truth known to all, is abſolutely neceſſary at this occaſion, to the end that not onely the lyer may find his craft to be folly, but alſo his wicked intent to be diſappointed, which is no leſſe then a breach betwixt the two Nations, and hath been ſuch from the beginning; and conſequently the ruine of both, now ſo united and joyned in the common intereſt of Church and State, that they muſt ſink or ſwim together; for if they ſhould once devide, as the one doubtleſſe will be preſently undone; ſo the end of the other will not be far off. Wherefore he that doth any evil office, to raiſe or increaſe jealouſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, under whatſoever pretext, is worſe then any open Enemy, and what he intends to the publike, will come upon himſelf, that is, ruine, with diſgrace.</p>
            <p>But, me thinks I hear you, whom I blame
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56773:11"/>
for ſilence in ſo neceſſary a caſe, and ſo need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full a time, ſay, <hi>We have not been wanting in this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing you find fault with:</hi> For we have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly and diligently communicated all things of any moment, freely and ingeniouſly, in all truth and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleneſſe of heart, to ſome chief leading men, our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular good friends, upon whom we have relyed, from our firſt hither-coming, in all things concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us and our Countrey-men, employed in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, to the end that they ſhould convey the truth of buſineſſe, as in diſcretion they thought fit, and did ſee cauſe, for the publike good, and for the right of us their friends, to the Houſes, and from thence to the publike.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, You have miſtaken the right way, Sirs, for you ſhould have made your addreſſes to the whole Parliament, or at leaſt to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee appointed by the Parliament to hear you, conſult with you, in a word, to deal or treat with you of all things, wherein you and they are jointly concerned; and not ſuffer your ſelves to be engroſſed by ſome few, howſoever they be Prime men: and what do you know, if by thus ſuffering your ſelves to be as it were led by them, hath not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed their credit? For men may ſay, that they have reaſon to follow thoſe, by whom you of ſo much repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of wiſdom and reſolution, are guided, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Further, ſhould not you have thought, that particular men, howſoever they ſerve the publike, have ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly particular ends of ambition and avarice, which the publike cannot have? And although thoſe your friends be free of theſe diſtempers, yet you are not aſſured of their conſtancy unto you; for many things fall out betwixt man and man, which makes them not onely fall from intimacy of one with another, but makes them adverſe and oppoſite one to another often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56773:12"/>
And, although your friends be free of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity; Are you wiſe men to relie upon others, for doing the things you ſhould do your ſelves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Procure? He that truſteth another to do a thing fitting for himſelf to do, muſt expect to have the thing done, if at all done, neither ſo timely, nor ſo well, at leaſt not ſo ſoon, nor ſo to his mind, as is it fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth out often: of extraordinary occaſions and occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, there is no certain rule.</p>
            <p>Next, I know, you will ſay, <hi>We have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted the Houſes of Parliament to the full with the truth of all things, by cut ſeverall papers given unto them at divers times, upon divers occaſions, and we have made known unto the Synode what concerneth Church buſineſſes, and ſo we think we have done enough in this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But give me leave, Sirs, under favour, herein alſo you are hugely miſtaken; you do well to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate freely and carefully unto the Houſes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament all things, and to acquaint them with your proceedings, wherein they have common intereſt with you, for the publike ſervice of Church and State, in theſe Dominions; I hope they do ſo with you, at leaſt, they ought to do it, for the common good of both; otherwayes, the work wherein both Kingdoms are ſo ingaged, and you both are employed, will go but ſlowly and limpingly on: Yet this is not enough; for, firſt, the main paſſages of publike things done, and the chief reaſons of the doing thereof, are to be made known to the whole Church and State, ſince the whole hath the chief intereſt in things common to all: although you are to communicate your counſels, deliberations, and concluſions of things to be done, for fear of miſcarriage, onely to the Truſtees of Church and State, as your ſelves are: Yet I ſay again, what, is <hi>de facto</hi> concerning all, muſt be made
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56773:12"/>
known to all; for the Truſtees of the State and Church, are not Lords of them, as Kings and Popes pretend to be; but ſervants, as they avouch them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſet on work by them, for the good of both, upon truſt, which if they betray, they are double Traitors: Firſt, they falſifie their truth to the State and Church, whereof they are Members and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and unto whom they owe all under God. Next, they betray the truſt impoſed upon them, for the good and benefit of both Church and State. Yea, the Houſes of Parliament themſelves, ſhew you the way how to carry your ſelves in this very particular; for they, not onely for the ſatisfaction of the whole Kingdom, cauſe publiſh the things done by thoſe whom they, as Truſtees, have employed to carry on the ſervice of the publike in the Fields; but alſo, they publiſh unto the Kingdom Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of their honeſt intentions, and fair proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, with Votes and Ordinances, for the good of Church and State: And I am ſure, the Truſtees of your Nation for your Church and State, have done ſo, from the beginning, in your particular trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; and that, not onely to your own Countrey, but alſo to your neighbour, which hath done no harme, neither to the advancement of your affaires at home, nor to your reputation abroad.</p>
            <p>Although the Houſes of Parliament reſt ſatisfied in themſelves of the honeſty of your proceedings: Yet this giveth but ſmall ſatisfaction unto the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>Yea, when you ſend in your papers to the Houſes, it may happen that divers Members are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the time, and ſo remain as ignorant of your affaires, as before the in-giving of the papers; for the Houſes are ſo taken up with other thoughts and buſineſſes, that they cannot acquaint the abſents
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56773:13"/>
with your own affaires; yea, ſome who are preſent in the Houſes, at the reading of your papers, are carried of their attention unto you, by divers diſtractions, and ſo receive but ſmall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge by them: Far leſſe can the Houſes take leaſure to publiſh your affaires unto the world; yea, I know not if in rigour they are tyed to do it. Although I confeſſe, it would be a good turn for the publike, and a brotherly office, if they would take the pains to do, or cauſe do it: howſoever, I am ſure, the Houſes are not ſo obliged to this duty, as your ſelves are; neither although they were, can they do it ſo fully as you, not being ſo particularly acquainted with things.</p>
            <p>In a word, in duty you ought to make known un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the publike your own proceedings, and theſe of your Countrey-men, employed in the ſervice of the Common Cauſe; that it may be made manifeſt what good you have done alone, either by counſell in the Houſes, or by action in the Field; what you have been aſſiſtants in, and what you ever have been will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to do, and are ſtill minded to do, providing you be not ſtopped; and if you have been ſtopped, let it be declared where the fault lieth, and not you bear the burden of other mens miſtakes and errors.</p>
            <p>Next, is it not fit, that it be publiſhed what you have done for ſuch vaſt ſummes of money raiſed upon the publike for your uſe, as is given out, and how much you have received of it? that if you have received all, you may make known what you have done for all; and if you have received more then your due, you are in conſcience and honour to do the publike the ſervice you are pay'd for beforehand: as likewiſe, if you have not received all which is rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for you, that it may be known how much of it is wanting, and enquiry may be made what is become
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56773:13"/>
of the reſt; and ſo, if you make it appear unto the world, that there is much ſtill due unto you of your pay, far above what you have received; then all honeſt people, being truely informed of things, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove your faithfull and fair carriage, acknowledge your love and kindneſſe, thank God for your help and aſſiſtance at ſuch an exigence, and be heartily civill unto you, till God enable them to recompence you for your faithfull pains, according to your juſt deſerts and their earneſt deſires; and ſo things will redound to your credit and advantage.</p>
            <p>You may know and feel all this, what I have been ſaying unto you, to be true, according to ſenſe and reaſon, by one ſeule inſtance, to lay aſide all others at this time:</p>
            <p>And it is this of the papers you gave into the Houſes, about the latter end of <hi>May</hi> laſt, upon occaſion of high murmurings againſt you, in and about the Houſes, by information of Malignants, which gave abundant ſatisfaction to ſo many of both Houſes, as either heard it them read (as is well known) or read them themſelves with attention: But, others of the Houſes, who are not acquainted with your papers, partly not hearing them, although preſent when per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they are delivered in, by reaſon of their other thoughts; partly being abſent, at that time, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained ſtill ignorant of your affaires, and poſſeſſed with calumnies againſt you: Far more the reſt of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>After ſome dayes, one Copy of theſe your papers having fallen, by chance, in the hands of a well-wiſher to the Cauſe, and no enemy of yours, was publiſhed under the name of <hi>the Scots Manifeſt,</hi> without your knowledge, which hath done more deſpite to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Truth, than any thing you have done this long time, and more right unto you then you
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56773:14"/>
looked for, yea, nor your ſilence deſerved; yet not ſo much as is needfull for you and your friends; for it did ſtop the mouths of the wicked calumniators, and inform many well-meaning men: and divers Members of the Houſes there were, who had not heard of ſuch a thing, before it was printed; to ſay nothing of the generality of the people, every where. Yea, I am told, it went beyond Sea, and there ſtopped the mouths of Malignants, and gained thoſe who were indifferent, and confirmed your friends.</p>
            <p>But what, you will ſay, <hi>Muſt the hid things or My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of State be divulged?</hi> No, I do not mean it, nor do I ſay it; For I leave the Myſteries of State to the Myſtes thereof; Onely my ſimple meaning and honeſt deſire is, that theſe things which are not, and ought to be, made known to all, be not kept in a miſt by a myſterious prudency, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the publike; ſuch are the things <hi>de facto,</hi> and of reaſon, wherein all are concerned: and theſe are the things I ſpake of.</p>
            <p>Beſides, you muſt think, there be many men not particularly employed in the publike Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, who have both hearts and brains, to ſerve the Common Cauſe; but cannot do it, while all is thus kept in a cloud, as in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, where the Myſtes think all men idiots but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and keep from the people the things of God.</p>
            <p>Then you will ſay, to tell plainly and openly, <hi>The Truth, perhaps, will not be pleaſing to all, yea, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance not to ſome of our fellow-Labourers.</hi> My advice is not, that you ſay or write any thing, in intention to diſpleaſe the leaſt of men, far leſſe to diſpleaſe theſe your Fellow-Labourers: But let Truth be ſaid above all things, when the publike requires it for its ſervice;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56773:14"/>
and we our ſelves are bound upon our own credit to do it. Be angry who will; God keep me from neglect and contempt, for lying or ſuppreſſing the Truth; I fear not anger for any publiſhing of Truth: He that is not bold to publiſh the Truth, for timorouſneſſe, belyeth his own knowledge, and I dare ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayeth the Truth. You that are truſted with the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of things, in Truth, and for the Truth, are not onely bound to make known the truth of what you do and ſay, to the world, as it hath been ſaid; but, further you are obliged in conſcience, and the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blike expects it of you, that you preſſe home the Truth with vigour &amp; reſolution, in all freedom, down-right, in all places, and at all occaſions, where you meet for conſultation, deliberation, debate, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of things concerning Church or State, in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litike and Eccleſiaſtike Aſſemblies; and in ſo doing, you will gain the price, having all honeſt men to ſtand to you; and will put ſuch a terrour in Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, that their malice will be much abated.</p>
            <p>Surely, I am perſwaded, had you been ſtouter in the Synode, theſe ſtrong heads, and factious few ones, who hitherto have troubled the ſetling of Church-affaires, and are likely to trouble the State, if it be not well looked to and neerly, had long ere now been quaſhed; and ſo, if you had not been ſo meal-mouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ſolliciſme in reaſon, of the time and place, <hi>I humbly conceive</hi> you had not met with ſo many rubs in your publike meetings, nor had your wholſome counſels found ſuch oppoſition, nor your men of war been ſo kept off Field action. All which hath not onely done prejudice to the publike Service; but hath brought things to great hazard, yea, almoſt to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing of all: But, God in his mercy hath turned the balance, no thank to your remiſſeneſſe, wherein God ſheweth, although men will not do what they ought
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56773:15"/>
and can do for his Service, upon I cannot tell what conſideration, he will do the work of men, by no men.</p>
            <p>When I think on <hi>John Knox,</hi> and <hi>George Buchanan,</hi> how freely they ſpoke and writ, at all times, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all occaſions, when the Church and State were concerned, without fear of any man or Aſſembly whatſoever; having nothing before their eyes, but the glory of God, and the good of his people. They were weak and infirm men, as we are all; but their ſtout zeal to the publike was admirable, and is ever to be remembred by us; not onely to their praiſe, but alſo to ſpur us up to imitate them in this heroike ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. For me, I value the zeal and ſtoutneſſe of theſe two Champions of the Truth, more than all their other vertues, howſoever eminent they were.</p>
            <p>But, you will ſay, <hi>It is now another age, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently another way of carriage of things is required.</hi> It is true, we live now in another age, which is worſe than that of theſe men: Wherefore, we muſt then ſtrive with greater zeal and vertue, to oppoſe the wickedneſſe of this time; For although, by a pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall preventing and declining, by clear-ſeeing men, many plots and deviſes of the wicked, may be for a time ſhunned: Yet, there is no way to make the wicked leave or weary of reſiſting and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing goodneſſe, but by a vigorous and ſtout oppoſing of them.</p>
            <p>Beſides, although the Cards be new we play with all; yet it is the ſame very Game that our Fathers had in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and our Neighbours had lately, in our dayes, in <hi>France;</hi> Where and when nothing did prevaile, or do good unto the Cauſe, but reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and zeal in carrying on the things, not onely againſt the Common Enemy; but alſo, againſt the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56773:15"/>
falſe Friends, and they that walked then any other way, betrayed the Cauſe, and purchaſed unto themſelves the title of ſilly inconſiderable men, of whatſoever rank or degree they were.</p>
            <p>To ſay nothing of the judgement of God that fell upon them, and to this day hangs upon them and theirs. I ſhun examples in this caſe; for I love to reprove faults, and ſpare mens perſons.</p>
            <p>Moreover, ſince the Malignants, every where, are ſo buſie running to and fro, like ſo many Bees, with great care and heat, and ſo bold, to forge and invent lyes, by word and writing, to abuſe the World, and ſo wrong treacherouſly the publike Service:</p>
            <p>Why ſhould not then faithfull men be diligent and ſtout, in all freedom, to make known the truth of things, for the confirming of the well-af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, and for ſtopping of the mouth of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and ſo conſequently, for the better carrying on of the work now in hand?</p>
            <p>Now, being thus friendly and freely admoniſhed by one who wiſheth well to the Common Cauſe you now ſerve, with his whole heart, and unto your ſelves in particular, in ſo far as you are faithfull and earneſt, zealous and ſtout in this Cauſe of God and his people, laying aſide all humane prudence, which is not ſubſervient to zeal and ſtoutneſſe, as well as to faithfulneſſe and earneſtneſſe: I hope you will take care to minde this ſlip, by giving unto the publike a true and free relation of all things from time to time, as the occaſion ſhall require; and in your meetings, about Church and State, to be ſtout and free, for the advancing of the publike Service to the glory of God, to the good of his people, and to the contentment and ſatisfaction of well-affected men, in deſpite of malignancy.</p>
            <p>In the interim, till you perform this duty, give
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56773:16"/>
me leave, in this place, plainly and homely to put unto the view of the World, the relation of ſome things of ſpeciall note, hardly well known to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, at leaſt taken notice of but by a few, concerning the carriage of the <hi>Scots</hi> ever ſince the very firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of theſe unhappy troubles to this day: the knowledge whereof, will do good, I am ſure, to the publike Service, and will help to right, in ſome meaſure, men both faithfull and conſtant in the Work: Yea, the commemoration of theſe things, although known, I am perſwaded, will give content to all honeſt and well-meaning men, unto whom the publike good is dearer than the intereſt of any particular man whatſoever, with whom they ought to go along no further than the particular man goeth on with the publike of Church and State, laying aſide all other relation. As for other men, I value them no more than the open declared ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, who preferre the pleaſure of one abuſed Prince, under pretext of obligation they have to him, unto the good of Church and State.</p>
            <p>And thus I begin. The Common Enemy having deſigne to bring theſe Dominions under ſpirituall and temporall ſlavery, all things diſpoſed for his ends, according to his mind; thinks fit for his purpoſe to begin this great work in <hi>Scotland,</hi> promiſing unto himſelf to find leaſt oppoſition there, for reaſons which hitherto, by Gods mercy, hath deceived him.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> being preſſed to receive the corrupt <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy,</hi> (to ſay nothing in this place, of what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore put upon them) fairly decline it, by ite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſupplications and humble remonſtrances unto the King: But nothing will do the turn, they muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Prelats Maſter-Peece, and <hi>Romes</hi> eſſay, the <hi>Nove-Antic-Service-Book,</hi> either by fair play or foul.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:56773:16"/>
The <hi>Scots</hi> on the other ſide, conſtant to their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, refuſe to receive the Book; for which they are publiſhed by the Prelats and the Court, to be refra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries and rude fellows, without God or Religion: Which gave occaſion to the <hi>Scots</hi> to make known, not onely unto their own people, at home; but, to all men abroad; namely, to their Brethren of <hi>England,</hi> by a publike Declaration, their condition, how they were wronged, the equity of their Cauſe, their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full proceedings, and their good intentions: by this means, their friends good will is confirmed unto them, and their enemies deſigne, in ſome meaſure, is broken; who did intend, by lyes, to ſteal from them the good affection of their friends.</p>
            <p>Next, The <hi>Scots</hi> being conſtrained to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the Sword, for their juſt defence, all other means tryed failing, were back-bitten as mutinous, taking Arms for poverty, with intention to caſt off the juſt Authority of their Native and lawfull Prince, and to invade <hi>England</hi> for the ſpoile thereof.</p>
            <p>To theſe moſt pernicious calumnies, the <hi>Scots</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth by another Declaration, particularly addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed unto <hi>England;</hi> whereby, they made known the abſolute neceſſity of their taking up Arms, with their honeſt intentions therein: All which, they made good thereafter, in due time, by reall performance.</p>
            <p>For, ſo ſoon as they had occaſion to ſhew their reſpect to the King, they did it, with all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe and ſubmiſſion; and when they might have undone the Kings Army, and conſequently invaded <hi>England,</hi> if they had pleaſed, and that with ſmall oppoſition, inſtead of doing wrong to any <hi>Engliſh,</hi> they ſupplied the wants of thoſe who were come againſt them, with Victuals, which then did abound in the <hi>Scots</hi> Army, but was very ſhort in the Kings; &amp; having the flower of the Kings Army in their power,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56773:17"/>
I mean the party that went to <hi>Dunſlaw;</hi> they ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to return back in ſafety, and uſed it with all civility, notwithſtanding theſe choſen ones had come againſt promiſe, and without cauſe, to deſtroy them, and to invade the Countrey.</p>
            <p>Thereafter, the Peace being made, the <hi>Scots</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the agreement, went quietly home, and laid down their Arms, as was promiſed.</p>
            <p>Then the Plot the abuſed King and his good Counſell had at <hi>Berwick,</hi> to draw the Chief men of <hi>Scotland</hi> to him, for to deſtroy them; and the breach of the Parlement; the burning in <hi>London</hi> of the Articles of agreement made at the borders, and many other like things, did not move the <hi>Scots,</hi> to recede in any meaſure from their dutifull reſpects to the King, nor from their love to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation; neither the impriſonment of their Commiſſioners, againſt the Law of Nations, and the ſafe-conduct granted unto them upon publike Faith; nor the great Forces prepared againſt them, by Sea and by Land; nor the many lyes ſpred againſt them, through all <hi>England;</hi> nor the Prelatical excommunication ſo cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nically ſpewed out againſt them, in all the Churches and Chappels of <hi>England:</hi> All theſe things, I ſay, did not make them give the leaſt expreſſion of diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the King, nor diſaffection to the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this, the <hi>Scots</hi> publiſhed a Declaration a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new unto the World, whereby they made known un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all, how hardly they were dealt with all; for, not onely the things ſtipulated with them, were not kept to them; but alſo, more and greater wrongs than formerly, were done to them: Yea, a ſecond expedition of War undertaken to deſtroy them; and to fill up all, more lyes of no leſſe impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, than the conquering of <hi>England,</hi> made and ſpred abroad of them, with other thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolts
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56773:17"/>
of the Prelaticall cenſure, ſhot againſt them: Alſo, they make known by this Declaration, their Chriſtian reſolution, and juſt enterpriſe, with their good intentions in taking Arms again, for their own defence, and the Cauſe which they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; And by it, aſſureth their Brethren of <hi>England,</hi> although they were reſolved to come into their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey to ſeek out their Enemies, who were there gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring againſt them; and not to ſuffer theſe wicked ones to come unto them, and ſo make their own Countrey the Seat of the unhappy War: Yet, they had not the leaſt thought to do any hurt to any body in <hi>England,</hi> except to their profeſſed Enemies: So far were they from having the leaſt thought of making a conqueſt. And that, when they had brought their Enemies to reaſon, they would go home in Peace.</p>
            <p>All which, was thereafter performed by the <hi>Scots</hi> to the full: For, firſt, being entred into <hi>England,</hi> and having rencountred one party of their Enemies, and routed it; when it was in their power to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue the Victory, they ſtayed at <hi>New-caſtle</hi> till things were agreed upon, betwixt the King and them.</p>
            <p>This incoming of the <hi>Scots,</hi> gave occaſion and liberty to divers of the Nobles of <hi>England,</hi> (of whom, ſome ſince have betray'd the Cauſe of God, &amp; of his people; what by open Warfare, and what by clandeſtine undermining:) to deſire, of the King, a Parliament, for the good of the Kingdom. The King then durſt not refuſe their demand, by reaſon of the <hi>Scots,</hi> more then the continuance of it, which he granted likewiſe therafter, for the ſame Cauſe.</p>
            <p>Then the King, finding that the Parliament did not onely croſſe, but quite ſpoile his deſignes, be plots with his Army, which he had raiſed againſt the <hi>Scots,</hi> to come and deſtroy the ſaid Parliament, and to take the ſpoile of <hi>London,</hi> for their reward. But
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56773:18"/>
the buſineſſe being diſcovered, faileth; beſides, they durſt not undertake, howſoever they had promiſed, for fear of the <hi>Scots,</hi> who then were ſo neer.</p>
            <p>The King continuing in his wonted courſes, after a little pauſe, tryes the <hi>Scots</hi> if they will do the deed; and offers unto them for recompenſe, not onely the ſpoile of <hi>London,</hi> but alſo the foure Counties next adjacent unto their Countrey, to be adjoyned here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after to it, with Jewels of great value in pawn for performance, if onely they would be engaged into the buſineſſe.</p>
            <p>All theſe great offers, could not make the <hi>Scots</hi> willing to give their conſent in any kinde to this wickedneſſe: For, they not onely rejected the Kings offers; but alſo, giveth notice of the Plot, to the Parliament, and to the City of <hi>London,</hi> that they might make their beſt uſe of it.</p>
            <p>So, you may ſee, how that the <hi>Scots,</hi> under God, are the cauſe of the Aſſembling of the Parliament, of the continuance of it, being aſſembled, and of the preſervation of it, from totall deſtruction and ruine.</p>
            <p>The King, ſeeing that he was ſtopped by the <hi>Scots,</hi> firſt, in their own Countrey, next, in <hi>England,</hi> to carry on his great deſigne, takes the <hi>Iriſh Papiſts</hi> by the hand, rather then be alwayes diſappointed; and they willingly undertake to levie Armes for his Service, that is, for the <hi>Romiſh Cauſe;</hi> the Kings de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne being ſubſervient to the <hi>Romiſh Cauſe;</hi> although he abuſed thinks otherwayes, and beleeves that <hi>Rome</hi> ſerveth to his purpoſe. But, to begin the Work, they muſt make ſure all the <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> and, if they cannot otherwayes, by Murthering and Maſſacring them; for they knew them, according to the Principles of Religion and State, to be forward, either for the Covenanters of <hi>Scotland,</hi> or for the troubleſome Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56773:18"/>
of <hi>England,</hi> if not for both. But the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> neither would, nor durſt enter to any open Action, ſo long as the <hi>Scots</hi> Army, in <hi>England,</hi> was afoot; therefore by all means, it muſt be ſent home and caſhiered: and to facilitate the buſineſſe, the Court-Paraſites, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of Iniquity, with their Emiſſaries, muſt raiſe and ſpread abroad, jealouſies of the <hi>Scots,</hi> among the people of the Countrey and City, namely in and about the Houſes of Parliament; who having not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their eyes, the reall Honeſty and Integrity of the <hi>Scots,</hi> known by ſo many faithfull and loyall expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; and not keeping in their mind the many good offices done to them by the <hi>Scots;</hi> giveth, in ſilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of mind, ear and place to the crafty tales and apprehenſions, invented by the Agents of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Enemy, to bring them to confuſion and trouble.</p>
            <p>So the Plot taketh by the ſilly ones, and is ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward by the hid <hi>Malignan's.</hi> Yea, in a word, it is managed with ſuch addreſſe and ſucceſſe, that the <hi>Scots</hi> muſt go home; and till they had done it, there could be no quiet, but increaſe of jealouſies.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scots,</hi> although they were not acquainted with the hight of miſchief that was intended againſt the Church and State in theſe Dominions, by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Enemy, nor with the wayes of it; yet, albeit they thought it very dangerous, after ſo many at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of evil doing by the Enemy to retire them from <hi>England,</hi> not as yet well ſetled; and to caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hiere their Army, remitting the event of things to God, reſolve to return home, and diſmiſſe their Army, and ſo make known unto all the World their Candour and Integrity, and to take away all jealouſies; both from the King and from <hi>England;</hi> which they do according to promiſe, not failing in the leaſt cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, yea, not of the day.</p>
            <p>Well, the King having gained this point, to ſend
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56773:19"/>
home the <hi>Scots,</hi> and to make them lay down their Arms, reſolveth to follow them into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and to trie once more to draw them to his deſigne; no perſwaſion being able to ſtay or to ſtop his voyage: he goeth in haſte from <hi>London,</hi> and overtaketh the <hi>Scots</hi> as their were upon their removall from <hi>New-caſtle</hi> for <hi>Scotland:</hi> He vieweth their Army by the way, and talketh with the Prime Officers thereof: He giveth Order to ſome of the good Phyſicians about him, to feel the pulſe of the <hi>Scots</hi> ſoftly, but they found the <hi>Scots</hi> pulſe did not beat as they could have wiſhed. He goeth on in his journey into <hi>Scotland,</hi> whither he is no ſooner arrived, but he puts another deſigne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot, premeditated with many more before: for, it is the cuſtome of the wiſe Court, to have, at one and the ſame time, divers undertakings in deſigne, of which, it is a very hard matter, it one or other do not take effect. Yea, they have found but too true, to our wofull experience, that many have taken effect, and that not of the leſſer ones, wherefore the Court will never ceaſe to deviſe and invent enterpriſes.</p>
            <p>The Plot then ſet afoot by the K. in <hi>Scotland,</hi> was to make a conſiderable. Party there for his ends: and to make the buſineſſe more facile, he reſolveth to make ſure the Chief men of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who were likely either to ſtop the deſigne, or not further it. But, this Plot is alſo diſcovered, and ſo it failed. The next recourſe was to the <hi>Iriſh Papiſts,</hi> his good <hi>Friends,</hi> unto whom, from <hi>Scotland,</hi> a Commiſſion is diſpatched, under the Great Seal (which Seal was at that inſtant time, in the Kings own cuſtody) of that Kingdom, to haſten, according to former agreement, the raiſing of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> in Arms; who no ſooner receive this new Order, but they break out, and at the firſt beginning of their Rebellion, declared that they had no ill will againſt any <hi>Scots</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> for they were
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56773:19"/>
afraid of the <hi>Scots</hi> going over to the help of their Countrey-men, and ſo they would be ſtopped to go on with their Work; but their ſpleen was againſt theſe <hi>Engliſh Proteſtants,</hi> who were Friends to that <hi>wicked Parliament</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> ſo untoward to the <hi>good King,</hi> and ſo adverſe to their <hi>Catholike Cauſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Declaration of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> did not (although in favour of their Country-men) hinder the <hi>Scots</hi> to offer their preſent Service, for the repreſſing of the Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion before things grew worſe; The King fairly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth the offer, and anſwering with verball thanks, ſaid that he neither could, nor would do any thing in the buſineſſe, without the advice and aſſiſtance of the Parliament, now a foot in <hi>England;</hi> whereunto he was to repaire in all haſte. So he leaveth <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſaying that every day he ſtayed there, was the loſſe of a County to him. He cometh to <hi>London,</hi> a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Chriſtmas;</hi> the Rebellion having begun in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in <hi>October:</hi> But he goe's very ſeldom to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and when he goeth thither, he ſayeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing concerning the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebellion, till by impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity he was conſtrained to it; and then what he ſaid, was little, cold, and ambiguous. And when the <hi>Scots,</hi> by their Commiſſioners, who had follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him from <hi>Scotland</hi> hither, did offer again a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable help of ten thouſand men, things were ſo carried, both in the Counſell and in the Parliament, by the corrupt and ignorant Party then, that the <hi>Scots</hi> were delayed from day to day, by one ſhift or other, for a long ſpace, before that conditions could be agreed upon with them, for the ſending of their help unto <hi>Ireland.</hi> And it was a longer time after the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, before things could be furniſhed unto them, for their Voyage.</p>
            <p>By thoſe means, the Rebels had ado with leſſe op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; and conſequently, with leſſe difficulty
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56773:20"/>
carried on their barbarous Work of ſpoiling, burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and maſſacring innocent people of all rank and condition, without regard to ſex or age.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> are no ſooner gone to <hi>Ireland,</hi> but they aſſiſt their Friends with ſuch affection and ſucceſſe, that after ſome skirmiſhes and renconters with the Rebels, the <hi>North</hi> Countrey of <hi>Ireland,</hi> whereunto their help was particularly aſſigned, became pretty well cleared of the Rebels, although much waſted and and ſpoiled by them.</p>
            <p>In this courſe, hath the <hi>Scots</hi> continued to this day, conſtantly oppoſing theſe bloody wretches, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the change that hath fallen in the <hi>South</hi> part of that Kingdom, by the treachery of thoſe whom the Parliament employed and truſted to. Then when the King made a Ceſſation with theſe barbarous Canni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals, the <hi>Scots</hi> reſolutely declared againſt it, and have manfully oppoſed it to this day: Without which oppoſition of the <hi>Scots,</hi> it had been received every where in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Rebels then, having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do at home, had come hither in Bands and Troups into this Iſland.</p>
            <p>Thus did and ſtill doth the <hi>Scots</hi> purſue their Point, notwithſtanding all the hardſhip they have ſuffered, and yet ſuffer in the Service, partly by reaſon of the great troubles here of the Parliament, not being able to ſupply their Friends, as they would, and as they need; partly by the negligence and unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of thoſe, who have been employed by the Parliament, and intruſted to have a care of ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this need; which hath been ſo great, that the <hi>Scots</hi> Army in <hi>Ireland,</hi> had abſolutely ſtarved for cold and hunger, if they had not been helped from <hi>Scotland,</hi> in a high meaſure.</p>
            <p>To return unto <hi>England:</hi> The miſled King having left the Parliament, accompanied, or at leaſt followed
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56773:20"/>
by numbers of men of divers degrees, Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to God and to their Countrey; namely by thoſe double Traytors, who were Members of the Houſes of Parliament: for, they not onely have been diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and unfaithfull to the Church and State, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they are born Members and Children; but, they have betray'd the truſt wherewith they were truſted in both. By the aſſiſtance of which, he ſets his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne on foot, to make open War againſt the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (although under a hid notion) to deſtroy it; all other Devices and Plots, contrived by him and his, having failed as we have ſeen.</p>
            <p>Upon this, the <hi>Scots,</hi> in their reſpect to the King, love unto their Brethren in <hi>England,</hi> and above all, in their affection to the Cauſe of the Church of God, ſend Commiſſioners unto the King, and from him to the Parliament, as the occaſion ſhould ſerve. They found the King at <hi>York,</hi> where he was pulling his Sword out of its ſheath, with all his might, and ſhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in all haſte, which God in his Jugements hath ſuffered him to thruſt in the bowels of ſo many thouſands of his people, here, ſo unnaturally and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouſly; not onely afar off, by not ſtopping it, by connivence or by Commiſſion to his Agents and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, as in <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Scotland;</hi> but being preſent in Perſon, and taking pleaſure in doing of it in his own ſight, and ſeeing of it done.</p>
            <p>In this place I do affirm, that there hath been more <hi>Chriſtian Blood</hi> ſhed in theſe latter yeers, under the end of K. <hi>James</hi> and K. <hi>Charles</hi> Raigns, by their Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, Approbations, connivences, and not-forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, what at home, and what abroad, all which upon the matter they might have ſtopped, if it had been their pleaſure, then were in the time of the ten <hi>Roman Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions.</hi> God turn the Kings heart towards him firſt, otherwayes he will never turn it toward his people.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:56773:21"/>
The <hi>Scots,</hi> as we were ſaying, ſend to him, to deſire him to leave off the deſigne of embroiling himſelf and the people in a Civill War, in this Kingdom of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> withall, to offer him their dutifull Service of Mediation and Interceſſion, for the taking away of all miſtakes, and ſmoothing of things in a fair way, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him and the Parliament. The miſled King reſolved to go on in evil courſes, not onely neglects the reſpective and hearty offer of the <hi>Scots;</hi> but ſends them home, not ſuffering them to come unto the Parliament, according to their order and deſire, which was to trye all fair means for the hindering of a War in <hi>England,</hi> and to ſtop the Maſſacres in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King having thus diſmiſſed the <hi>Scots,</hi> goe's to his Work, which, having overcome ſome rubs at the firſt, he carrieth on apace; for having gathered together conſiderable Forces at <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> from thence with his Army he marches towards <hi>London,</hi> notwithſtanding the Parliaments-Army lay, as it were, in his way, who met with him at <hi>Edge-hill,</hi> and (contrary to his expectation) fights with him. He, after the Battel, having recollected the remnant of his men, although he had had the worſe, continues his deſigne for <hi>London,</hi> and drew very neer unto it; but being, by ſtrong hand, conſtrained to retire, he goeth to <hi>Oxford,</hi> where he hath kept his Court conſtantly ever ſince till this day.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> ſeeing the commotions increaſing in <hi>England,</hi> and conſidering the chief Inſtruments of thoſe evils, could not in conſcience and honeſty, ſit quiet any longer, and neither ſay nor do, while the State and Church of their Brethren in <hi>England,</hi> were thus in ſo great troubles; ſend firſt a Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioner from their Church unto the Parliament, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire them, that as God, in his good Providence, had
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56773:21"/>
furniſhed them juſt occaſion to caſt out the Prelats from among them, not onely as unuſefull Members of their Aſſembly; but alſo, as Enemies to all their juſt proceedings for the good of Church and State; ſo they would be pleaſed to thruſt out theſe Tyrants and belly-gods from the Church, as main Inſtruments of all the diſturbances, troubles, and miſeries which are come, and of more, in all appearance, yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if God in his mercy prevent them not.</p>
            <p>The Commiſſioner, after ſome debate, having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained his demand, returneth homeward, and taking his way by the Court, then about <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> made known to the King how he had ſped in his errand, wherewith he had acquainted him before, as he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Parliam. And he deſireth the King to give his conſent unto the caſting of the Prelats out of the Church, as he had done to the putting them out of the Aſſembly of Parliament. To which the King did reply little or nothing; but he told the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioner, that he, and they who ſent him, were hugely miſtaken, if they did think that the Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth intend any ſetled Reformation, namely, as in <hi>Scotland;</hi> for, ſaid, he, you ſee how they do not repreſſe the Schiſmes and Sects of all kinds, which abound in and about <hi>London;</hi> yea, theſe evils are coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced by ſome under-hand. Would to God that the Commiſſioner had had as juſt reaſon then, to anſwer unto the King, that he had been miſinformed, and that an untruth had been told him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Sectaries, as he hath been miſtaken in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of both Houſes of Parliament, for the ſetle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Religion, according to the beſt way, as it expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Nationall Covenant.</p>
            <p>Then, after that things, by degrees, had come to a great hight betwixt King and Parliament, much blood being ſhed, not onely in skirmiſhes and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56773:22"/>
but alſo in pitched Battel, to wit, at <hi>Edge hill.</hi> The <hi>Scots</hi> not being able to forbear any further, to try once more by fair means, if it were poſſible, to ſtop the courſe of thoſe miſeries, too far already gone on, ſend word to the King, then at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and to the Parliament, of their good intentions; and demand a paſſe and ſafe-conduct from both, for Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners from them, to go unto both, and return home, as alſo to go to and fro betwixt them as cauſe ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. Of the Parliament, they had eaſily what they demanded, with thanks for their good will: But the King, not liking their offer, was loth to grant a paſſe; yet being put to it, he could not fairly deny, and ſo at length, after ſome reluctancy, he ſends a paſſe as was deſired, and ſafe-conduct to the <hi>Scots;</hi> which being received, they ſend their Commiſſioners ſtraight to the King, unto whom they remonſtrate home how that he had, by bad Counſell, caſt himſelf in a Labyrinth of Evil, and the people of his Dominions; which, doubtleſſe, would bring both him and them to utter ruine, if not timely ſtopped in Gods Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, by his Wiſdom and good Counſell.</p>
            <p>The Commiſſioners, inſtead of any poſitive an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, receive nothing but doubs, ambigui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, delays, and ſhifts, whereof nothing could be made, but that the miſled King was reſolved to his own and his peoples ruine.</p>
            <p>After a time, the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners told the King, that, according to their Order and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, they intended to go unto the Parliament; which they hoped he would think well of, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove. But the King, notwithſtanding the paſſe and ſafe-conduct he had granted them to that purpoſe, would not ſuffer them to go unto the Parliament; yea, they were not permitted to ſpeak with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners from the Parliament, who were then ſent
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:56773:22"/>
thither to the Court to treat when they were there. Such was the adverſeneſſe of the Court to Peace, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the Kings Proteſtations.</p>
            <p>Further, the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners were ſo hardly uſed by the Court, namely, by the Prelaticall crew, that they could not in ſafety go openly and freely abroad.</p>
            <p>This is not all. At that time the Rulers of the Court ſend abroad their Agents, to tell every where, namely, in and about <hi>London,</hi> what indignity the <hi>Scots</hi> did offer, firſt unto the King, then unto the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to the whole <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, by taking upon them (being but Subjects) to examine the diſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences betwixt the King and Parliament, to compoſe them, and to make a Peace; it being more honourable both for the King, and Parliament, and the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to be beholden for this unto a Neighbour-State or Prince, then unto the Kings own Subjects, not ſo good as others in many reſpects.</p>
            <p>As this Diſcourſe was invented, and ſpewed up and down by <hi>Malignants,</hi> ſo it was received by the ſimpler ſort, not knowing the intereſt of States, leſſe, wherein the true Honour of Princes, States, and Nations conſiſteth: Yet, they might have conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that it is better to take up things quietly at home, then to trouble the Neighbours with our affaires.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners, after ſome Moneths abode at Court, ſeeing they could do no good with the abuſed King, deſire him to diſmiſſe them, which he did put off from day to day, till at laſt he was written to by the State of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that if he ſent not home in ſafety the Commiſſioners betwixt ſuch and ſuch a day, they would hold it as an open breach of the Peace, and that they would provide for buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes accordingly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:56773:23"/>
Upon this the Commiſſioners, loden with fair, but conditionall promiſes from the King (who yet would not anger them) of Love and Care of that his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Kingdom, ſo that they would be quiet, (for he could not ſtop his mouth to ſay unto them, that if they would not ſtirre, he could eaſily compaſſe his ends in <hi>England)</hi> take their leave at Court, and go home. At their arrivall, they find a number, in the <hi>South-Weſt</hi> of their Countrey, of <hi>Papiſts</hi> and other <hi>Malignants,</hi> men of broken for tunes, riſen to diſturbe the Peace of the Kingdom, by Order from the King, notwithſtanding his fair words; which commotion was preſently quaſhed, through Gods Mercy, by the diligence and forwardneſſe of the good Gentry and Nobility in thoſe parts, who did riſe like one man againſt theſe Sons of <hi>Belial.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners retired home, the Houſes of Parliament of <hi>England</hi> were made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted how that their good intentions were fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, themſelves hardly uſed for a long time, but at laſt, with difficulty had gotten home.</p>
            <p>Now, the State of <hi>Scotland</hi> ſeeing the Common Enemy come to the hight, that nothing will ſatisfie him, but totall ſubverſion of Church and State in theſe Dominions; onely they, perhaps, might be kept for the laſt, although in intention they had been the firſt; jugeth it not enough, for their intereſt in the Common Cauſe, to keep an Army in <hi>Ireland;</hi> but alſo to be upon their guard at home, that they might ſtop any enterpriſe the Common Enemy ſhould undertake againſt them to have any progreſſe in their Countrey, if they did not altogether prevent it: and to help their Brethren in <hi>England</hi> with their Sword, ſince all other means ſo often tryed, were diſappointed by the malice of the Enemies. And ſo much the rather were they moved to this, that the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56773:23"/>
Enemy was prevailing almoſt without let, for by that time he was Maſter not onely of the Field, but alſo of all the ſtrong hold in the <hi>North,</hi> except <hi>Hull</hi> alone, with a numbrous and victorious Army of Horſe and Foot, domineering and ſpoiling every where: likewiſe the <hi>Weſt</hi> being almoſt altogether gone by the loſſe of <hi>Exceſter,</hi> the defeat given to the Parliaments Forces at the <hi>Vyſes,</hi> and the baſe ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendring of <hi>Briſtol, Banbury, &amp;c.</hi> the Enemy did think to carry all before him, ready to enter into the Aſſociated Counties, yea, to come to the Gates of <hi>London;</hi> which they had done in all appearance, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the let of that Noble and never enough praiſed exploit of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> of relieving of <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> almoſt at the laſt extremity, although valiant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſended by that brave Governour <hi>Maſſey,</hi> in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite of the proude Enemy; and thereafter in beating of him at <hi>Newbery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While the Parliament was thus low, many faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>harted, yea Members of the two Houſes, ran away to the Enemy, and others did withdraw, ſtudying, to their eternall ſhame, to make their Peace more plauſibly with the Enemy, and not to run over to him at diſcretion as others had done.</p>
            <p>But when things are thus almoſt in deſpaire, then it is thought fit time to have recourſe to the <hi>Scots,</hi> and to call them for help: The Parliament, to try if they could do the buſineſſe themſelves, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out troubling the <hi>Scots,</hi> was wiſdom: for what need you call for aid, and trouble your Neighbours, when you can do the buſineſſe alone? but not to call for help till things be too low, it is very dangerous, ſay thoſe who dive more deeply in affaires of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But, the reaſon why the <hi>Scots</hi> were ſo long a calling in for help, was, not that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were not willing to trouble their Brethren the <hi>Scots,</hi> for,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:56773:24"/>
why ſhould they think of troubling the <hi>Scots,</hi> ſince their Fathers had been ſo ready to help <hi>Scotland,</hi> in its diſtreſſe then? Generous hearts will as freely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a courteſie as they do one, otherwayes they were proud, and ſelf-conceited: But, the true cauſe, (ſay they who know the myſteries of the time) firſt was, that the Sectaries, prevailing with the Rulers of affaires, did ſo keep them from medling with the <hi>Scots,</hi> whom they knew to be no leſſe adverſaries to Schiſmes and Sects, then to Popery and Prelacy: Next, there were ſome who yet kept ſtill a bit of a Biſhop in their Belly, although by both Houſes declared to be not onely unuſefull in Church and State, but alſo enemies to both.</p>
            <p>Howſoever, theſe conſiderations muſt be laid aſide for a time, and in ſuch extremity the <hi>Scots</hi> muſt be called to help; yea, ſome of thoſe who are ſaid to be the greateſt ſticklers for Sectaries, muſt at laſt be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in their calling in; which was long of coming, after it was reſolved upon, by the ſhifts of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Church and State.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scots,</hi> notwithſtanding all that had been ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified unto them, concerning the favouring of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries by the Parliament, and of their retaining ſomewhat of the old leaven of Prelacy; ſeeing that their help was altogether needfull to ſave the Church and State of <hi>England</hi> from ruine; heartily received the call, being already reſolved beforehand upon the Point, and undertaketh, with a Chriſtian and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſolution, to engage themſelves in a ſeen danger, and to undergo the hazard (but, for <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his people no hazard is to be regarded) to help their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted Brethren: Yet, with this precaution, that the Parliament ſhould ſincerly joyn with them in the ſetl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Church, as they were heartily willing to aſſiſt them againſt the Common Enemy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:56773:24"/>
This condition was granted unto the <hi>Scots</hi> by the Commiſſioners from the Parliament of <hi>England;</hi> and to this end, it was agreed upon, at the deſire of the <hi>Scots,</hi> that there ſhould be one Covenant and League made betwixt both Kingdoms, and ſworn to, for the ſetling of the Church according to the Word of God, and conform to the beſt Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Churches, and by name, to the Church of <hi>Scotland;</hi> with the juſt Liberty of the people, and againſt all oppoſition whatſoever. But, becauſe the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commiſſioners would not take upon them to draw up and to make the Covenant there in <hi>Scotland,</hi> they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired that there might be Commiſſioners ſent from <hi>Scotland</hi> unto the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> for the drawing up of the ſaid Covenant, and ſo was done; for the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners aſſiſting, the Covenant, after divers debates, was made, and thereafter ſubſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ſworn firſt by the Houſes, Synode, and the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners, and then by the people, and ſent unto <hi>Scotland,</hi> where it was received, ſubſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and ſworn by the convention of States, and then by the people: with all, in teſtimony of their true meaning, the Houſes of Parliament deſireth the Commiſſioners of <hi>Scotland</hi> to aſſiſt in the Synode, in their deliberations and concluſions concerning the Church.</p>
            <p>The Covenant is no ſooner taken, but the King leaveth off to accuſe the Parliament of continuing Schiſmes and Sects, and thereafter tells us, that he will have care of tender conſciences, and this to make faction and diviſion, as we have ſeen ſince.</p>
            <p>While things were thus managing at <hi>London,</hi> about the Covenant, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commiſſioners in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> are agreed with the <hi>Scots,</hi> concerning the Army they were to ſend into <hi>England:</hi> the Articles of agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being drawn up, and conſented to by both
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:56773:25"/>
parties; Commiſſions were given for twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men; who with all the haſte poſſible, were gathered together, and then immediatly ſet forth: ſo in <hi>January</hi> they march, when it was both great froſt and ſnow, and entering into <hi>England,</hi> with ſmall oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition come as far in as <hi>Tyne:</hi> the Countrey, much burdened before, was either all waſted and utterly ſpoiled by the Enemy, hearing the <hi>Scots</hi> coming with a great number of men, &amp; great power; ſo they could like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly find nothing in that Countrey, but what by ſtrength of Arm they could pull out of the hands of the Enemy. Thus did the <hi>Scots</hi> fight for a while with their Enemies, to wit, with a multitude of men well arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with evil weather, in the moſt intemperate time of the year, and with want of Victuals, which was the worſt of all: and truely, it had gone hard with them, if it had not been for the proviſions ſent to them from home, which came but by difficile and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain carriage by Sea, by reaſon of the ſtorms which fell out then: Yet, theſe reſolute men were ſtill gaining ground upon the Enemy, in number of men as great as they, at leaſt, and far exceeding them in Horſe, till at laſt they paſſed the River <hi>Tyne,</hi> have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo wearied and harraſſed the Enemy with conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall skirmiſhs and onſets, obliging him to lie without, and keep ſo ſtrait and conſtant guard and watch, that in the end he was conſtrained to retire, and give way to the conſtant for wardneſſe of the <hi>Scots;</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of his men leaving him for wearineſſe and want, others falling ſick, and numbers being killed at divers rencounters; at one namely there was eight hundred of them ſlain at <hi>Bauden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For all this, while the <hi>Scots</hi> were thus fighting with theſe three Enemies above-named, for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Cauſe expreſſed in the Covenant, ſome men at <hi>London,</hi> and that not of the meaner ſort, did not ſtick
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56773:25"/>
to whiſper in the ear one to another, that the <hi>Scots</hi> did not carry themſelves neither as military men, nor as men of courage: this was the leſſe regarded, that it was made by thoſe, who, againſt their will, did give way to their calling in.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> did ſo take up the Enemy in the <hi>North,</hi> about <hi>New-caſtle</hi> and <hi>Dureſme,</hi> that Sir <hi>Thomas Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fax,</hi> aſſiſted by Sir <hi>John Meldrum,</hi> took the Field again, (having for a long time been confined to <hi>Hull,)</hi> and tries Fortune: he begins at <hi>Selby,</hi> which he man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully aſſaults, and happily takes.</p>
            <p>Then thoſe who had not been well pleaſed at the coming in of the <hi>Scots,</hi> did begin to ſay, Now ſince <hi>Selby</hi> was taken in, the <hi>Scots</hi> might retire, they could do the work without them; but this diſcourſe did not take by many.</p>
            <p>The Enemy hearing the news of this brave exploit, fearing for <hi>York,</hi> leaſt Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> ſhould carry it, run as faſt as they could towards that City.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scots,</hi> as ſoon as they hear of the Enemies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movall, go after him on his heels, taking ſome of his men and bagage, and follow him unto the Gates of <hi>York.</hi> Upon this, My Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> joyn with the <hi>Scots;</hi> who ſend to the Earl of <hi>Mancheſter</hi> for his help, to beſiege <hi>York,</hi> the Town being of ſuch circuit, that the <hi>Scots</hi> alone, having left of their men in <hi>Sunderland</hi> and other places taken by them from the Enemy, neer <hi>New-caſtle,</hi> were not able to compaſſe it with ſuch circumlineation as was needfull, and keep the Fields, ſo full of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries; yea, not with the help that My Lord <hi>Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fax</hi> brought unto them. <hi>Mancheſter</hi> joyns with the <hi>Scots:</hi> There were ſome here that were againſt <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſters</hi> going <hi>North-ward</hi> to the <hi>Scots,</hi> not caring how much work the <hi>Scots</hi> had, and how little ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:56773:26"/>
A little hereafter, to be ſhort, while the Forces of <hi>Mancheſter</hi> and <hi>Fairfax,</hi> joined with the <hi>Scots,</hi> are about the ſiege of <hi>York</hi> unanimouſly; there is one who goe's from hence to ſow ſome diſſention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Generals, <hi>Leſley, Fairfax,</hi> and <hi>Mancheſter;</hi> which deſigne is diſappointed by Gods Mercy: then, there is another ſet a foot by others, to wit, by the Sectaries, which, although it did not riſe to a breach, yet it did come to a diſtaſte and diſlike; for the Sectaries under <hi>Mancheſter</hi> his command, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the way of the <hi>Scots</hi> was ſet abſolutely againſt their intentions, concerning the Church-buſineſſes, as mainly did appear by the preſſing of Church-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by the <hi>Scots</hi> in the Synod, and their oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of Sects, think themſelves, that ſince they were come to ſome ſtrength, they muſt not rely ſo much upon the <hi>Scots,</hi> now being able to ſtand upon their legs with their own Force, and do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to eclipſe the <hi>Scots</hi> whom they had ſo far extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led formerly, which, while they were weak, and in diſlike with the people, for the miſcarriage of things, (ſay thoſe who pretend to know the main paſſages of buſineſſes;) now at the ſiege of <hi>York</hi> they begin to ſhew themſelves, who had been under a cloud, and by ſome notable action, think to make the world take notice of them: ſo a party of them, without order of their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, enter in the Town of <hi>York,</hi> thinking to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry all before them: but, not acquainting their friends of their deſigne, they could not be ſeconded, and ſo were repulſed with great loſe, and became wiſer thereafter then to undertake any thing more in this kinde; wherein they did ſhew, that when they did think it time for them to do, they would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon no order; and ſo, neglecting Military Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline, bring all to confuſion. This fault was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed for once by ignorance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:56773:26"/>
After ſome moneths ſiege, the united Forces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>York</hi> hearing of Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> his coming towards them, ſend a party of both Nations into the Town of <hi>Mancheſter</hi> to ſecure the place, and to buſie the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in his way towards them, till they had advanced their work at <hi>York:</hi> The Enemy taking no notice of that place, and paſſing through with his daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing Army, goeth on as he was approching, the united Forces ſend Scouts to know his march and his ſtrength; upon whoſe relation, they leave the ſiege, and go to meet and fight him, thinking if they had diſpatched his Forces, they would have leſſe add in the work they had ſtook ſo long to: Upon miſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, they take the wrong way to meet the Enemy; ſo he had, upon this miſtake, free acceſſe to the Town.</p>
            <p>The united Forces, ſeeing their miſchance, turn their courſe to ſtop the Enemies further coming <hi>South-ward;</hi> he, puft up with the ſucceſſe of gaining free acceſſe to the Town, reſolves to follow the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Forces, and fight them, promiſing unto himſelf, that his good Fortune would continue; and if he had given a blow to their Forces, he would eaſily put an end to the deſigne in hand; for the <hi>Scots</hi> being once routed, the main let and hinderance to the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Court, would much diminuſh the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of the Parliaments party.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, the united Forces perceiving the Enemies mind, turn head towards him, fight with him with Gods bleſſing, and rout him; but, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out loſſe; for, notwithſtanding all the care taken by the old and experimented Chief Commanders, firſt to put all in as good order as time and place could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, and to keep things in order in time of Battel; the new raiſed Horſes of <hi>York-ſhire,</hi> neglecting the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and example of their Noble and Gallant
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56773:27"/>
Leader, who in this occaſion, as in all other, carried himſelf valorouſly; fall in diſorder themſelves, and turning towards theſe of their own ſide that were to ſecond them, put many in ſuch confuſion, that they would take no notice of any Commander or Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; yea, they carrie ſome away with them by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
            <p>In this Battel, divers gallant men of both Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions had an honourable ſhare of the Victory: but, none I hear of, without diſparagement to any, did appear ſo much in action that day with gallantry, as <hi>David Leſley.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here, the Sectaries, to indear themſelves to the people, attribute unto themſelves the honour of the day, and ſtick not to call their Champion <hi>The Savour of the three Kingdoms,</hi> when God knows, he that they extoll ſo much, did not appear at all in the heat of the buſineſſe; having received at the firſt a little ſcar, kept off, till the worſt was paſt.</p>
            <p>After the Victory, and the Town of <hi>York</hi> taken in, the Generalls write to the Houſes of Parliament to give thanks to God; and, in token of their thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to ſetle the buſineſſe of the Church, and trye once more if it were poſſible to reconcile differences with the King, in a peaceable way.</p>
            <p>Things being ſetled at <hi>York,</hi> by common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, the <hi>Scots</hi> go to <hi>New-caſtle,</hi> to beſiege it, as the fitteſt ſervice they could do for the publike then, neer the place they joyn with the Earl <hi>Calender</hi> his Forces, who had come from <hi>Scotland</hi> to repreſſe the raging Enemy about <hi>New-caſtle,</hi> while <hi>Leſley</hi> was at <hi>York</hi> with his Army<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the <hi>Scots</hi> drawing neer <hi>New-caſtle, Calender</hi> and <hi>David Leſley,</hi> with ſix men more, went to view the place, from which there iſſued two Troops of Horſe, which the eight men routed, having charged twice through them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:56773:27"/>
The <hi>Scots</hi> for a long time endeavoured to take in the Town by fair means, but at laſt, through the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy of thoſe who were within, they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to ſtorm it, and ſo carried it.</p>
            <p>Thoſe very men, who at the Battell neer <hi>York</hi> were put in diſorder and fled with others, gave the aſſault, and took <hi>New-caſtle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, the <hi>Scots</hi> being Maſters of the Town, wrong no man, woman, nor child, takes a mediocre com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition for the ſpoile; in a word, they carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with ſuch moderation, that the Enemies who had been in Arms againſt them, were conſtrained to ſpeak well of them.</p>
            <p>Few dayes after the taking of <hi>New-caſtle,</hi> the Caſtle of <hi>Tinmouth</hi> is taken by the <hi>Scots.</hi> The Winter by this time beginning, after ſo hard em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of the laſt Winter, and ſo toyling a Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, as the ſiege of <hi>York</hi> and the Battell, beſides divers skirmiſhes and rencounters with the Enemy, then the long ſiege of <hi>New-caſtle,</hi> and at laſt the ſtorming of it; they reſolve to put their men in Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons.</p>
            <p>During the ſiege of <hi>New-caſtle,</hi> many calumnies was raiſed againſt the <hi>Scots,</hi> and ſpewed abroad by <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants,</hi> and received here by the ſimpler ſort. As the taking of <hi>New-caſtle,</hi> was the moſt important peece of ſervice of that kinde, that could be done to the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> namely to the City of <hi>London;</hi> ſo it did rejoyce all honeſt men: but, on the other ſide, the <hi>Malignants</hi> of all kindes were ſorry at the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it; but more ſorry, that it was done by thoſe, who are ſo conſtantly oppoſite to their courſes.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> are not ſooner peaceable Maſters of <hi>New-caſtle,</hi> but the trade is renewed again betwixt it and <hi>London,</hi> to the comfort of the poor of <hi>London,</hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:56773:28"/>
who were ſtarving for want of fire, and to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the richer ſort. The Coales above and under ground, were rated &amp; diſpoſed on in equity, to the beſt uſe of the publike, not wronging the particular, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the advice and by the Order of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of both Kingdoms, then reſiding in the <hi>North,</hi> as the Commiſſioners appointed by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament can be witneſſes; to whoſe conſciences I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale, if all this be not true. And the <hi>Engliſh</hi> pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foners, taken by the <hi>Scots,</hi> have been diſpoſed on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the will of the Houſes of Parliament, as ſoon as it was poſſible to be done by Military Order.</p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Scots,</hi> after the taking of <hi>New-caſtle,</hi> although they were free of the open oppoſition of the Common Enemy for a time, yet they were mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted, vexed, croſſed, and traduced by the <hi>Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,</hi> Agents to the Enemy, in the Northern parts, beſides thoſe in and about <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here you muſt know, that thoſe of the Northern Countreys of <hi>England,</hi> have been conſtantly given to ſuperſtition, as men neglected in their inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or of purpoſe detained in ignorance by the Prelats, fore-caſtingby that means to make them the furer for their deſigne: And ſo, the King himſelf, at two ſeverall times, did find them ready for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne: The Earl of <hi>New-caſtle</hi> thereafter, did find them likewiſe ready to follow him: So, what by breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and what by latter yeers cuſtome, they are for the moſt part in that Country <hi>Malignants.</hi> Next, the heavy preſſures of Souldiers for ſo many yeers, with the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſſe of the ſoile (the <hi>Seots</hi> now coming upon them) made them clamotous, things not going according to their mind; For, firſt, not liking the Cauſe; next, being already ſo ſpent, they were very ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the leaſt thing could be demanded of them; joint the malice of ſome of the chief men in the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:56773:28"/>
Countrey, made the people murmure at firſt, them riſe up in Arms; but, bleſſed be God, the inſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction was ſoon calmed.</p>
            <p>Further, thoſe who are employed by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to manage the affaires of theſe Countreys, have put all the power in the hands of theſe who are wicked <hi>Malignants,</hi> being either profeſſed Recuſants, Sectaries of divers ſorts, or at the beſt Prelatiques, ſticking to the old Service-Book; yea, ſome of thoſe who have been in actuall Rebellion againſt the State under the Earl of <hi>New-caſtle,</hi> who are of the Committees of theſe Countreys, now having the power in their hands, ſpoile the Countrey, and oppreſſe good men, laying the blame of all upon the <hi>Scots,</hi> as hath been of late repreſented unto the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, by men without exception, deputed hither from theſe Countreys, in the name of many good men, to acquaint the Houſes with the ſtate of buſineſſes there.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Malignants</hi> of the <hi>North</hi> Countreys carrie their buſineſſes ſo, that they find Favourers and Agents to excuſe them, and to further their evil courſes. Let this, what I ſay here, be throughly ſifted out, &amp; it will be found too true, to the prejudice of the good Cauſe. God help us, and amend us; for, what can we expect, when lyers and other wicked men find this favour and patronage?</p>
            <p>The Winter declining, the <hi>Scots</hi> diſpoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for the Field-Service, ſo ſoon as the proviſions demanded, in a very moderate proportion, could be had from hence; which went but late to them, by reaſon there was a time ſpent for obtaining the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance from the Parliament; next, a time for making ready; thirdly, a time of ſending of things. In the interim the <hi>Scots,</hi> although buſied in keeping the ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected of the Countrey in obedience to the State, ſends parties now and then, upon occaſion, as the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56773:29"/>

                  </gap>ton,</hi> and to <hi>Scarbor ough, &amp;c.</hi> at laſt, the <hi>Rendivous</hi> is aſſigned to the Army the 15 of <hi>Aprill:</hi> to this effect, they require the Committee of that Countrey to provide draughts againſt the day afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid; but, they could not have any in readineſſe till the firſt day of <hi>May,</hi> at what time they marched to <hi>Rippon,</hi> with intention to come ſtraight <hi>South-ward,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the direction of the Committee of both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, if they could have ſome few dayes proviſion (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all hazards) and draughts. But, notwithſtanding all their care and pains, they could obtain nothing but delays and incertainties, with promiſes onely of proviſion from night to night.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Scots</hi> had had their reaſonable demands for proviſions and draughts, they had been neer the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my before he had done the evil he did at <hi>Leiceſter</hi> and elſewhere.</p>
            <p>While the <hi>Scots</hi> were at <hi>Rippon,</hi> it was reſolved that <hi>David Leſley</hi> ſhould go into <hi>Lancaſter-ſhire</hi> with a party, and he was to have a thouſand <hi>York-ſhire</hi> Horſes to aſſiſt; but, what performance there was of this, God knows, for he had not the third of armed men, although a thouſand was promiſed.</p>
            <p>By this time, the <hi>Scots</hi> are advertiſed that the Enemy was with a flying Army to paſſe through <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter-ſhire</hi> to <hi>Carlile,</hi> and from thence into <hi>Scotland:</hi> upon which advice, reſolution is taken, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Committee, that the <hi>Scots</hi> ſhould go into <hi>Lancaſter-ſhire,</hi> and ſtop the Enemies paſſage <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               </hi>ward. After a ſerious enquiry made, the onely way for them to go, is by all means through <hi>Weſtmer land:</hi> From <hi>Rippon,</hi> notwithſtanding the roughneſſe and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties of the Countrey, in foure dayes they are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the borders of <hi>Lancaſter-ſhire</hi> with their whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; whither being arrived, they have intelligence
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56773:29"/>
of the Enemies turning back again <hi>South-ward;</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately they deſire ſome ſmall proviſions for their Souldiers, and draughts, at the Committee of <hi>Weſtmerland</hi> and <hi>Cumberland:</hi> but they found them very ſlow and unwilling. Likewiſe, the <hi>Scots</hi> being ſo neer, they deſired that their Forces before <hi>Carlile</hi> ſhould be ſupplyed ſo far with Victuals, as to keep them from ſtarving; wherein they were the more earneſt, that they ſaw how ſlackly thoſe who were with their Forces, followed the buſineſſe: Doubtleſſe, if they had left then <hi>Carlile,</hi> the Enemy had been ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, and had kept it to this day; which in all appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance was the deſire of theſe Committees.</p>
            <p>After the <hi>Scots</hi> had ordained things the beſt they could concerning <hi>Carlile,</hi> they march <hi>South-ward</hi> in all haſte beyond ordinary; for, ſome dayes they marched above twenty miles: but after, they were conſtrained to ſtay in ſome places, one, two, and three dayes, for draughts.</p>
            <p>While the <hi>Scots</hi> were ſtrugling with theſe difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, news are ſent to the Parliament that the <hi>Scots</hi> were gone, no body knew where, and that they ſpoiled all the Countrey: and this was not done by open and declared Enemies, but by thoſe whom the Parliament truſt in theſe Countries with the managing of affaires; yea, by ſome who formerly did profeſſe hearty Friendſhip unto the <hi>Scots:</hi> but the wheel of their own intereſt turning about, not onely have they delinquiſhed the <hi>Scots;</hi> but alſo, have declared themſelves oppoſite unto them, and this without any cauſe: ſo far prevaileth private intereſt with men, who ſeems to be beſt.</p>
            <p>Then, great murmures riſe, that the <hi>Scots</hi> would abandon their Brethren at ſuch a neceſſary time, leave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the burden of the War unto the Forces of the Parliament in the <hi>South.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:56773:30"/>
Thus were the <hi>Scots</hi> innocently traduced by <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this, the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners here, take, occaſion to ſent a Gentle-man to the Army, to know the truth and veritie of things; and within a day or two thereafter, ſeeing the ſiniſtrous reports increaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſent two of their own number to be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of all things more fully, and haſten their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>South.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time, the Houſes of Parliament preſſe to know what was become of the <hi>Scots,</hi> and why they had gone this unexpected way, and why, after ſo many and earneſt calls, they did not march <hi>South-ward,</hi> the good of the publike Service ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring.</p>
            <p>Whereupon, the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners gave in two papers to the Houſes, containing a plain and full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the naked truth and reaſon of things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired; the ignorance of which had, by the ſhifts of <hi>Malignants</hi> officiating for the Common Enemy, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned a great murmure againſt the <hi>Scots</hi> up and down.</p>
            <p>Theſe papers gave ſuch ſatisfaction to all thoſe who heard them read, and gave attention to them, that nothing was to be replied to the leaſt circumſtance mentioned in them; yea, not by thoſe who had been moſt enclining to give credit to ſiniſtrous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors. Yet theſe papers were ſo little divulged, that divers of the Houſe of Commons, who either had been abſent when they were given in, or not attentive when they were read, did not know of any ſuch thing.</p>
            <p>Next, although the papers had given full content to the Houſes, yet the ſlanders of <hi>Malignants</hi> not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly continued, but increaſed daily more and more againſt the <hi>Scots.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:56773:30"/>
After ſome few dayes, there falleth a Copy of theſe papers into the hands of one, which being ſhewed by him to ſome well-affected men, and lovers of the Common Cauſe, were thought ſit by all means, for the publike good, to be publiſhed. As this was adoing, ſome <hi>Malignants</hi> get notice of it, and ſtrive to ſtop it, by dealing with him who had the chief care of the buſineſſe; but in vain, for he was reſolved to go on with his deſigne: ſo, he giveth the papers to the Preſſe, which the Printer intitles <hi>The Scots Manifeſt:</hi> This being publiſhed, opened the eyes of many men, to ſee the truth of things which formerly had been kept in a cloud.</p>
            <p>The publiſhing of this <hi>Manifeſt,</hi> did much vex the <hi>Malignants;</hi> but, they then were more grieved to ſee it ſo well received, and the truth therein contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſo greedily laid hold on by the people, whom they hitherto had ſo groſly abuſed by their malicious lyes.</p>
            <p>Upon this, theſe lye-inventers bethink them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of another ſhift, to cozen the World in this ſame buſineſſe, and they go this way to work; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they could not hinder the printing of the <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt,</hi> they reſolve to know whether, or no, the thing had been done by Order from the Commiſſioners, who being enquired if they had cauſed print the <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt,</hi> they anſwered no; and ſo it was, for without their knowledge the thing was done; becauſe that thoſe who had a care of the printing of it, knew very well that the Commiſſioners, going on in their ordinary courſe, upon I know what prudentiall ſcrupuloſity, do make known nothing of that they acquaint the Houſes with, fearing to offend, howſoever needfull to be opened for the publike Service, and their own credit; but, if there be any thing to be ſaid againſt them, although without ground, they muſt hear of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:56773:31"/>
it on the deaf-ſide of their ear, and it muſt be in every bodies mouth. Then the forgers and publiſhers of lyes gave out, that the <hi>Manifeſt</hi> was a falſe and ſuppoſed thing, ſince the Commiſſioners did not own it; when as they onely did ſay, that they had no hand in the printing of it, although they ayouch the thing to be in it ſelf moſt true.</p>
            <p>Thus in this place I have ſet down a full relation of the publiſhing of the <hi>Manifeſt,</hi> whereof I touched ſomewhat before, upon another occaſion, to make more known unto the World, with what cunning and crafty malice the <hi>Malignants</hi> of all kindes do op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the truth upon all occaſions, and how they ſtudy to hide it from thoſe whom it doth concern, to the end they may feed them with lyes more eaſily, the truth being kept from them.</p>
            <p>After that the Commiſſioners had ſent, as we have ſaid, to the Army two ſeverall diſpatches, the Houſe of Commons think it fit likewiſe to ſend ſome of their number to the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Army, to ſee how things went in the ſaid Army, and to haſten it <hi>South-ward;</hi> who met the Army about <hi>Rippon,</hi> and come along with it no <hi>Nattingham,</hi> where thoſe Gentle-men leave the Army, and come back to the Houſes, whom they acquainted with the truth of all things, as namely, of the good condition of the Army, conſiſting in a fair number of brave Commanders and luſty Souldiers, of their ability and readineſſe to do Service. Which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, as it did content and pleaſe honeſt men, ſo it did gal and vexe the <hi>Malignants</hi> of all kindes. But with what difficulties of want of proviſions and of carriage the Army had to ſtruggle with in this march, and hath had formerly, yea, hath to this day, for any thing I know, except things be mended of late, as now I hope they are, or at leaſt will be ſhortly, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond expreſſion, partly through the neglect of ſome,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56773:31"/>
partly through the malice of others, (and that not of the meaner ſort) who make their ſtudy, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to furniſh no encouragement to theſe who are come for their help; but alſo, give them all the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſte they can, to make them weary of the Service, yea, to make them do things by the Law of neceſſity to keep themſelves from ſtarving, which otherwayes they would not, and ſo make them odious to thoſe for whoſe good they are come into this Countrey. If this were done by an open Enemy, yea, by thoſe who declare themſelves to be indifferent, it were to be in ſome kinde digeſted; but, it is done by thoſe who would make men beleeve, that they are not onely moſt addicted to the good Cauſe; but alſo, that they are advancers of the Service, whereas they make onely the Cauſe ſerve for a cloke to their ambition and avarice, in their heart caring for nothing, howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they make a ſhew otherwayes, but to compaſſe their own ends, whereunto a ſhew of affection to the good Cauſe doth contribute, namely, where they have any credit.</p>
            <p>But, to leave off complaining of thoſe who are neither faithfull nor honeſt to the Cauſe, in thus uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Scots,</hi> I (going on in my Diſcourſe) will ſay a word or two, in this place, to the clearing of three things, whereof the firſt is concerning the moneys received by the <hi>Scots</hi> for their pay, ſince their firſt undertaking either in <hi>Ireland</hi> or in <hi>England</hi> unto this day.</p>
            <p>The next is, how and what proviſions they have had for their going on with the Service, either here or in <hi>Ireland.</hi> The third is, of the diſorders committed by the <hi>Scots</hi> in their Armies, either in <hi>England</hi> or in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, I aſſure you, in the name of the <hi>Scots,</hi> that their earneſt deſire is, that all theſe things in particular be exactly tryed by the Law of Arms, and in equity
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56773:32"/>
judged, where the failings are, and by whom and how, to the end that every one may have his due of praiſe or of ſhame, of thanks or of blame, of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſe or of puniſhment, of remembrance or of oblivion, according as the cauſe ſhall require: and the ſooner this be done, the better it will, for the Service of the publike, and the encouragement of honeſty, and the repreſſing of wickedneſſe.</p>
            <p>In the mean time I will tell you in generall, that what money is received by the <hi>Scots,</hi> is far ſhort of what they ought to have, and that they could wiſh their Armies in <hi>England</hi> (to ſay nothing of their Forces in <hi>Ireland)</hi> had as much money for ſix weeks, as the other Forces, employed in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice with them, have in two weeks; and this without jealouſie, or envie that others are look<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d and cared for; yet there is no reaſon why they ſhould be neglected, ſince they are conſtantly following the publike Service with activity and faithfulneſſe. There is a great ſtir of ſending money to them, and far greater of raiſing it for them, although they receive but a very ſmall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, in regard either of what is allowed for them, and leſſe of what is due unto them, and leaſt of all, what is ſaid to be levied for them; Wherefore, I ſay again, they are moſt deſirous of fair reckonings among Friends; let the payment come when it may, the moſt preſſing neceſſity being ſupplied.</p>
            <p>Next, For proviſions, beſides the ſmalneſſe of them, they come ſo ſlowly, I muſt ſay again, that when they are upon their march, they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to ſtay three dayes in one place againſt their will, for one dayes proviſion, and draughts can hardly be had for their march: as it hath been in their march, ſo it is in their abode, witneſſe their being ten dayes before <hi>Hereford,</hi> not ſeeing bread but one day, all the reſt liying upon Beanes, green Corn,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:56773:32"/>
and Fruits. In theſe they are ſo croſſed, that it ſeems to be done expreſly, for the diſenabling them, ſo far as may be, to do the publike Service anſwerable to their own deſire and readineſſe, and to the expectation of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>As for the diſorders ſaid to be done in the Army, as it is acknowledged that they are not Angels of Light, without feeding, being but poor infirme men, they cannot but fall and do amiſſe, in many and many a thing; ſo they are not Cameleons to live upon the air, but are of ſuch conſtitutions, that they muſt have more ſolid food of neceſſity for their ſubſiſtance, which now and then they cannot come by ſo orderly as ſhould be. Yet I dare be bold to ſay, that the <hi>Scots</hi> Army is as well regulated, as moſt Armies are, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out vanity be it ſaid; and that exorbitancy or ſcandall is no ſooner known, but it is cenſured &amp; puniſhed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its degree, by Eccleſiaſticall and Military Law; and that no complaint is made, but it is heard and anſwered, according to equity and reaſon: Yea, Proclamations are made to incite every one that hath any complaint, to repaire unto the Prime-Officers, or Counſell of War: Yet let the Leaders do what they can, ſome ſlips will fall out among the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers that are not allowable; and indeed the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders cannot be altogether ſo exact as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways they would be with the Souldiers, ſince the pay is ſo ſlow, and ſo little of it at a time, and proviſions ſo ſcarce and ſo hardly had; for when the bellie is thus extreamly pinched, it were hard meaſure to beat the back.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Scots</hi> Army came to <hi>Nottingham,</hi> the Generall ſent a Letter ſubſcribed by himſelf, and two more, unto the Committee of both Kingdoms, whereby, in few words, he tels how that the <hi>Scots</hi> employed in this Service of the Common Cauſe,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:56773:33"/>
have had, and have to this day, very harſh uſage and hard meaſure in divers faſhions, even from theſe who not onely by the Common Intereſt of both Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are bound to be then Friends and Brethren; but alſo, from theſe who formerly made a particular ſhew of Friendſhip unto them: Yet, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all this, he declareth how that with hearty ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſſe, they are in readineſſe to go on faithfully and reſolutely with the Work: But, judging that a view of the Letter it ſelf, would give ſatisfaction to many, I have thought fit to ſet down here a true Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py of it, furniſhed unto me by a Friend.</p>

WE have heard how the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> ſent Commiſſioners into <hi>Scotland,</hi> to call in the <hi>Scots</hi> unto its help, and to capitulate with them concerning their in-coming: We have heard alſo, how that Commiſſioners were ſent from <hi>Scotland</hi> hither, to be at the drawing up of the Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the two Nations; who ever ſince have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly aſſiſted the Synod in the diſcuſſion of Church-affaires, more according to agreement betwixt the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: thereafter, there was other Commiſſioners ſent hither to ſhare with the Parliament in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging of State-buſineſſes of Peace and War, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in now both Kingdoms are jointly ingaged. To this effect, the Houſes of Parliament chuſeth a certain number of Lords and Commons, to treat of all things concerning Peace and War jointly with the <hi>Scots,</hi> and ſo together they make up the Committee of both Kingdoms, wherein the <hi>Scots</hi> have a negative voice; and nothing is done, or at leaſt ought to be done, without their knowledge and conſent, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Peace or War, directly or indirectly, all play under boord, and clandeſtine dealing, being forbidden to both equally, upon the reaſon of the common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of both.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who had been adverſe unto the in-coming of the <hi>Scots</hi> to help the Parl. were much againſt the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up of this Committee; but at laſt, after ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, the thing is done in ſpite of oppoſition: So the Committee is ſet afoot for a certain time of ſome few Moneths, by Ordinance of both Houſes. The time prefixed for the ſitting of the Committee is no ſooner expired, but thoſe ſame men, with the aid of others, whom they had ſtirred up to that purpoſe, caſt in diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and will by no means give conſent for the continuance of this Committee: ſo for ſome dayes
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:56773:35"/>
it is broken up; then earneſt work there was to get it reſtabliſhed again; but all to ſmall purpoſe, till in the end, there is found one Clauſe in the Ordinance for the ſetting it up at firſt, which did ſerve for the reſtabliſhing of it, maugre thoſe who did oppoſe it. Since that time, it hath continued conſtantly to this day, although not without vexation to ſome, namely, becauſe the Committee could not ſit without the <hi>Scots</hi> being preſent.</p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Scots</hi> called and joined with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to manage the affaires of the publike Service, for the Common Cauſe of Church and State; at firſt, they did think that they were to have nothing, or at leaſt, little ado, but to put forward the publike Service with earneſtneſſe and vigour, againſt the Common Enemy, without any let here by any of their own party; and ſo, they reſolve with themſelves to be very modeſt and tender, with all warineſſe in their proceedings with their Brethren of <hi>England,</hi> who had called them hither upon ſuch aſſurance, and were ſo kinde unto them in their expreſſions, yea, ſo carefull of them, that they would have them to lodge neerer for their own convenience, and that of their Friends going to viſit them; and ſo the <hi>Scots</hi> remove from the City, where they had lodged in former time, and are placed in <hi>Worceſter-houſe,</hi> where now they lodge.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who pretend to know more of the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the World then other men, tell us, that the removing of the <hi>Scots</hi> from the City to <hi>Worceſter-houſe,</hi> was not ſo much the convenience of the <hi>Scots,</hi> or of their Friends, which was intended, although ſo given out, as their weaning from their old Friends in the City, who formerly had been ſo uſefull and ſo reſpective to them, by a cunning for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſting of ſome men, to wear them out of acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56773:35"/>
and intimacie with the City, being afraid not to carry on things ſo eaſily, according to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, if the <hi>Scots</hi> were conſtantly intime and familiar with the City.</p>
            <p>Whatever the end of removing the <hi>Scots</hi> from the City was, it is fallen out ſo, that the <hi>Scots</hi> being at ſuch a diſtance, have not been able to cheriſh and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh their former intimacie and old Friendſhip with the City, as they are bound in gratitude carefully to do, and as the publike Service requireth, joint with their own advantage.</p>
            <p>Thereafter, the <hi>Scots</hi> finde a harder task then they had promiſed unto themſelves in the beginning; for, beſides the great and main work againſt the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Enemy, they find ſome few men, here in the party whereunto they are joyned for the Service of the Common Cauſe of Religion and Liberty in all the three Kingdoms, who do not onely ſhew them but ſmall favour; but alſo, as far as can be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out open breach, croſſe and oppoſe them, and, in them, the publike Service: Firſt, thoſe who from the beginning did not approve of their in-coming, for fear they ſhould eclipſe their luſtre, and diminiſh their power, was cold and adverſe to them.</p>
            <p>Next, ſome others of thoſe who had moſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtirred themſelves, and moſt appeared in the call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of the <hi>Scots</hi> to help, having done the work of their in-bringing, lay down a new ground for the reparing the breach of their own credit, which by the miſcarriage of things, namely in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> as we have ſaid before, had been much diminuſhed, and by degrees make up their credit upon the decline of the others; whereunto their earneſtneſſe for the <hi>Scots</hi> did much ſerve, and the <hi>Scots</hi> intimacy with them, for many gave willingly way unto them, when they did ſee them ſo intime with the <hi>Scots,</hi> whom they knew to have
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:56773:36"/>
no by-ends; and thoſe men, on the other ſide, did endear themſelves unto the <hi>Scots</hi> by ſundry good of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices for a time, which they did unto them in things concerning their Forces in <hi>England</hi> &amp; <hi>Ireland,</hi> employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Common Service; and by their conſtant and frequent courting of the <hi>Scots,</hi> they did ſo take them up, that they alone, almoſt, were admitted to any privacy: then ſome did laugh in their ſleeve, to ſee a few, not ſo conſiderable before, bear ſuch a ſway and the <hi>Scots,</hi> led thus by the noſe; and others did complain, ſaying, <hi>Why ſhould this be?</hi> It was expected, the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners ſhould have been open and free to all honeſt men, namely to thoſe of worth; yea, they ought to have been ſo for the good of the publike Service, and for their own cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, not captiving themſelves as it were to ſome few ones. Further, it was ſaid, that they ſhould have preſſed home buſineſſes more ſtoutly and more freely then they did, as they had done in former times in their own particular affaires, when they had not ſo many profeſſed and powerfull Friends, letting no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing paſſe of that was, clearly for the good of the publike.</p>
            <p>By this complying complaiſance, the <hi>Scots</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners have given ſuch advantage to thoſe who for a time courted them moſt for their own ends, as it ſeems; for, if it had been altogether for the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blike, the <hi>Scots</hi> remaining conſtant to their point and principles, although with leſſe vigour, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, then I could wiſh, thoſe men had not changed, for ends, which when they had obtained, one after another, did withdraw from the <hi>Scots,</hi> and in a ſhort time point-blank oppoſe them, by whoſe help, they chiefly had raiſed their hight of reputation and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion among men.</p>
            <p>The firſt and main occaſion of miſtake betwixt
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:56773:36"/>
thoſe men and the <hi>Scots,</hi> was the Church-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. When the <hi>Scots</hi> did engage themſelves in this Common buſineſſes, they did ſtipulate with the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Commiſſioners, then in <hi>Scotland,</hi> that they ſhould go heartily &amp; freely along with them, in ſetling the Government and Diſcipline of the Church, as it was thereafter ſworn to by both Kingdoms, in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Covenant. And when the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners came hither, and entred into the Synod, they found it had ſat long, and advanced but ſmall buſineſſes; as for the Government, they had not touched it at all, which in all appearance was kept off by a ſlight of Prelatiſts and Sectaries, to ſtop the ſetling of the Church according to the beſt way, expreſſed thereafter in the Covenant.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> ſeeing the loſſe of time, and the evils which were likely to follow, if there were no ſet Government in the Church; preſently moveth the Synod to fall to the Diſcipline and Government; which they do, and therein a great deal of pains is taken in ſetting out the Truth, and refuting the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of ignorants, and oppoſitions of head-ſtrong wilfull men, who prefer the ſetting up of their own Chymerick fancies, and <hi>Utopian</hi> dreams, to the Peace of the Church; wherefore I may juſtly ſay, whatſoever gifts or endowments they have, whether of preaching or of praying, of languages, or ſciences, ſince they want charity, they have nothing; for, if they had the leaſt grain of charity, they would not thus diſturb the Church.</p>
            <p>I adde, He that ſacrificeth the Peace of the Church to the Idol of his own Imagination, is as he who cauſeth his children paſſe through the fire to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After much ſtrugling, things being brought neer a concluſion, ſome of thoſe upon whoſe Friendſhip
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56773:37"/>
the <hi>Scots</hi> had till then ſo much relyed, did declare themſelves to be altogether adverſe to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the <hi>Scots</hi> were ſo deſirous of: whereat, the <hi>Scots</hi> were much aſtoniſhed: Firſt, becauſe the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances given by thoſe men unto them, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of their engagement, for furthering the Church-government intended; next, by reaſon of the Covenant, whereby the <hi>Scots</hi> conceive us all to be bound unto the government of the Church according the Word of God, and the beſt Reformed Church abroad, and namely to the government of the Church of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ever ſince that day to this day, thoſe men having with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn their temporary affection from the <hi>Scots,</hi> have oppoſed their counſells, and croſſed their proceedings, in every thing wherein they are concerned, as far as in them lieth: And this they do not onely them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but, draw others for humane reſpects, to ſide with them in ſo doing. Yea, ſome there be of this phantaſticall opinion in this Kingdom, who ſtick not to ſay, that they will rather chooſe to joyn with Popery, Prelacy, and with whatſoever blaſphemy, or hereſie, then to ſubmit to the government of the Church by Presbyterie: ſuch is the phreneſie of thoſe mad men.</p>
            <p>As thoſe men we ſpoke of a little above, were, in what they could, againſt the in-bringing of the <hi>Scots,</hi> and thereafter did oppoſe the ſetting afoot and the continuance of the Committee of both Kingdoms; ſo thoſe ſecond men, of late, have grumbled, yea to ſome of them words have eſcaped, that it was a trouble for the Committee to have the <hi>Scots</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joints: Yea, it ſeems there was a deſigne to do buſines without the <hi>Scots,</hi> and that of great moment, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the both Nations are concerned, as may appear, namely, by naming and aſſembling of a ſub-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:56773:37"/>
without knowledge of the <hi>Scots:</hi> Wherewith the <hi>Scots</hi> acquainted the Houſes by their papers, given in by them about the midle of <hi>May</hi> laſt. Further, the ſecret intelligence for the ſurpriſing and taking of <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> (at aneaſie place) then unfurniſhed with provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, given by one <hi>Patric Naper,</hi> to a Sub-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of three, whereof, there was one of them a <hi>Scot,</hi> is neglected: notwithſtanding the <hi>Scots</hi> did preſſe it much, that the thing ſhould be tryed; they could not prevaile: The excuſe was, that till the Army, then a moulding, was in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect frame, they would undertake nothing. More, the Enemy is acquainted with the ſecret advice of the enterpriſe, and that particularly, who before had not taken notice of the weakneſſe of the place named by the advice; which the Enemy finding to be true, repaires and ſtrengthens.</p>
            <p>All this then, is known to be true by intercepted Letters, which have not been communicated to the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners, notwithſtanding the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Intereſt. I am much miſtaken, if it was the <hi>Scot</hi> who diſcovered the advice to the Enemy: Be it who will, let him lay his hand to his heart, and giving glory to God, confeſſe his own wickedneſſe; for at laſt, it will be diſcovered to his ſhame, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded.</p>
            <p>When the Army was moulded, according to the mind of ſome few men, then <hi>Oxford</hi> muſt be beſieged, and the Enemy ſuffered to run up and down, increaſe his Forces, and ſpoile the Countrey, yea, to bring all to a great hazard. Yet the new Army muſt lie before <hi>Oxford,</hi> wherein there was not the men by third part requiſite to ſuch a Siege; far leſſe to take in the Town: Yea, thoſe men who were there, were not furniſhed with materials for the the Siege. But, many think there was no intention to take the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:56773:38"/>
Town by open Siege, by thoſe who were contrivers of the deſigne, ſince they neglect to trye if it could be done by ſurpriſe &amp; ſecret enterpriſe: All this while, the chief Commander was moſt ready to act his part faithfully and gallantly, as he hath done happily ſince.</p>
            <p>From this Siege, the <hi>Scots</hi> not onely do openly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but alſo, did proteſt againſt it: Yet, when the thing was cried out upon, not only at home, but abroad, by Forrainers, who ſaid, <hi>That the Enemy was devouring the Fleſh, while the Parliaments Forces were gnawing the Bone;</hi> &amp; they did not ſtick to ſay, that fair dealing was not every where. More, the party of Horſes which were ordained to follow the Enemy, was recalled back, againſt the advice of the <hi>Scots;</hi> who having acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Houſes of Parliament with thoſe paſſages, ſhould have made known to the whole World, that after their own conſtant integrity, &amp; ſimple ſincerity, more and more made known to all, in theſe things, and the faults of others ſifted out, and they not bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the blame of other mens errors, the Service of the publike might go the better on.</p>
            <p>Further, it was given out, that the <hi>Scots</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming <hi>South-ward,</hi> was the occaſion of all theſe diſorders committed by the Enemy.</p>
            <p>But, let reaſon judge, whether or not, it was eaſier for an Army, provided with all things for the Field and marching, within very few miles of the Enemy, to follow him, diſturbe him, and ſtop him from increaſing his Forces, and doing Evil, then to an Army above two hundred miles diſtant, who notwithſtanding their willingneſſe and readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to march, according to their calling <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               </hi>ward, could get neither draughts, nor abſolutely neceſſary proviſions for a march, in ſuch a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as was thought very reaſonable.</p>
            <p>The truth of this may appear, what troubles Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:56773:38"/>
               <hi>Leſley</hi> found at <hi>Rippon,</hi> to get proviſions and draughts, and how he went to <hi>York</hi> to that effect, but to very ſmall purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Let things be tryed, and no longer thus carried in hugger-mugger, to the prejudice of the publike Service.</p>
            <p>We have heard, how that, and upon what occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſome of thoſe, who had been ſo intimate with the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners, leave them, neglect them, and oppoſe them in their proceedings, ſo far as they can in a ſmooth-way above board, to ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of what is done under-hand.</p>
            <p>So in this place, you ſhall take notice, how that, on the other ſide, there be divers of thoſe, who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly had cared ſo little for the <hi>Scots,</hi> that they neither favoured their in-coming, nor thereafter had aſſiſted them ſo willingly, in their honeſt &amp; faithful endeavour for the advancement of the publike Service; now, at laſt, bethinking themſelves of their own error, and how that, without reaſon, they had been jealous of the <hi>Scots,</hi> they begin to go along with them more freely and earneſtly in the publike Work, then they had done heretofore; which the <hi>Scots,</hi> minding mainly the furthering of the Service of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Cauſe, take kindly at their hands, and welcome the expreſſions of their good affection to the Service, with reſpective civilitie; wiſhing from their heart, that thoſe who are now withdrawn from them, would return unto their wonted correſpondence, in ſincere and brotherly unanimity, for carrying on the heavy and redious Work, now lying upon them all.</p>
            <p>Upon this, there is great murmuring againſt the <hi>Scots,</hi> that they had quite left off honeſt and well-affected men, and taken ſemi-Malignants by the hand, who not onely had been ſlack and backward in the purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the publike Service; but, adverſe unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:56773:39"/>
in particular. To all this, the <hi>Scots</hi> do declare truely, that as when they came hither at firſt, they took no intereſt in any man more then they jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him, in all appearance, to intereſt himſelf hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without by-ends, in the Common Cauſe; and, as yet, they do the ſame, reſolved to continue ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the end, conſtant to their firſt principles: and, if any men have withdrawn themſelves from them, not willing to go conſtantly along with them in this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary courſe, they are ſorry for thoſe, of whoſe conſtancy they were in a kind aſſured: and they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to the World, that they neither gave, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to give any juſt diſtaſte in their particular to any: But, if men will ſnuff, becauſe they are not humeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in all things, who can help it? The <hi>Scots</hi> did think, at their coming in, to have nothing a do with chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and women, who muſt be humeured; but, with ſet and ſtaid rationall men, without any by-reſpects, or private Fancies, wholly conſtants to the Cauſe both of Church and State, as we are all ſworn by the Solemn Oath of the Nationall Covenant: As for thoſe, who having caſt off their former miſtakes, now go along with them more earneſtly then former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the buſineſſes, they cannot but welcome them, as all thoſe, who put to their helping-hand heartily in the leaſt kinde to the great Work of God, and of his people; howſoever their carriage have been to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their perſons, for the publike (they having no ſpleen nor grudge at any) forget whatſoever hath been amiſſe towards them, praying God to forgive, that his Work may be carried on more cheerfully and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly, and they are likewiſe diſpoſed and enclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards thoſe (who have left them off) to go along with them, ſo freely and ſo brotherly as at the firſt; &amp; they will imbrace them cheerfully, in carrying on the buſineſſes of Church &amp; State with them. This they
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:56773:39"/>
declare not to captive men by cunning inſinuation, as factious ones do; but to invite all men fairly to go on with the Work of Church and State, according to the Covenant, as they hope a bleſſing from Heaven, if they be zealous and faithfull, without equivocation; and may expect judgement, if they either faint or be not ſincere. Of this enough for this time.</p>
            <p>Yet, there is one thing I cannot paſſe, and it is this: There be hardly any diviſions among theſe of this ſide, of which the blame is not laid upon the <hi>Scots;</hi> as if they had not had their jealouſies one of another, and grudges one againſt another, by reaſon of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular intereſt and private opinion, before the <hi>Scots</hi> did join with them; when it is well known, that the <hi>Scots</hi> aſſiſtance, faithfull in the Counſell, and active in the Field, is not onely uſefull and neceſſary for the oppoſing and repreſſing of the Common Enemy; but alſo, for keeping together thoſe, who otherwayes in a likelyhood, would fall aſunder, and ſo the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blike Service ſuffer, at which the Enemy aimes.</p>
            <p>Then I adde, that the Enemy, howſoever low he ſeems to be at this inſtant, deſires to have no better Game, then that the <hi>Scots</hi> would retire and withdraw their helping hand from the Service; for he that of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing made a party ſo great as to carry all before it, till he was repreſſed by the <hi>Scots,</hi> would raiſe up his party again. But, in deſpite of the devil, and all oppoſition, whether clandeſtin or open; the <hi>Scots</hi> will ſtand firm and faithfull, for the carrying on of the Work of God, and of his people.</p>
            <p>After a certain time, the States of both Kingdoms, reſolved to try yet again if they could reclaime and recall, upon any reaſonable terms, the abuſed and miſled Prince, from his evil courſes of undoing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> people and himſelf, cauſe draw up certain Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:56773:40"/>
by Common Counſell of both Nations, which they ſend by Commiſſioners of both States, to the King; in whom they find nothing but ſhifts and delays: So they return without effectuating any thing.</p>
            <p>A while thereafter, the infortunate Prince intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make the ſimpler ſort beleeve, that he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firous, at laſt, of a reall agreement, ſends hither Commiſſioners (of whoſe honeſt meaning, the people did leaſt doubt; but in the end, they were found to be cajeolors) to draw things towards a Treaty, unto which the <hi>Scots</hi> declared themſelves to be inclined, (the main buſineſſes of Church and State being ſecured) as willing to try all means poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, upon all occaſion, to take up the differences in a fair way, to ſave further effuſion of Chriſtian and Brothers blood, and further ruine of thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys.</p>
            <p>For this, the <hi>Scots</hi> are cried out upon, as evil men, (by inconſiderate perſons, ſet on by <hi>Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants)</hi> notwithſtanding the Treaty goe's on, but to ſmall purpoſe; the Kings Commiſſioners feeling the pulſe of the Parliaments Commiſſioners, did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe unto themſelves, upon what ground they know beſt, or at leaſt ſhould know, that they could carry all things to their mind, if it were not for the rude and ſtiffe-necked <hi>Scots,</hi> who were ſo firm to their principles, and reſolved rather to follow on the Work with honour and conſcience, although with hazard and danger, then to yeeld to a baſe agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to the prejudice of Church and State.</p>
            <p>Upon this, the Court-Commiſſioners cry out againſt the <hi>Scots,</hi> as the onely hinderers of their ends, and the ſtoppers of their deſignes, firſt at home in their own Countrey, next here, both in the Fields and in the Counſell.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:56773:40"/>
By this, you may ſee, if there were no other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, with whom and againſt whom the <hi>Scots</hi> have ado: what was the carriage of the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, in the Treaty of both Church and States af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires; let both parties freely tell, if they did find in the leaſt point of honeſty, faithfulneſſe, reſolution, prudence, knowledge, or reſpect amiſſing in them.</p>
            <p>But, the Treaty ends, without any concluſion for good, nothing being intended by the Court in it, but to gaine time, &amp; more &amp; more to abuſe the people, and ſo make the beſt advantage of buſineſſes.</p>
            <p>Things having been carried in the Field, almoſt ever ſince the beginning of theſe Wars, namely the laſt Summer, not ſo well as they might have been, for the advancement of the publike Service, by the fault of ſome of thoſe who were employed in the ſaid Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; whether it was want of skill, want of care, or want of ſincerity and uprightneſſe, in purſuance of the buſineſſe, I will not in this place enquire, leſſe will I reſolve; but, a fault there was, and that a great one, and much amiſſe.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, the Parliament, upon juſt reaſon, having tryed divers times to amend the errors of the Armies, and correct what was wrong in them in a fair and ſmooth way, but all to ſmall purpoſe; takes reſolution to reform wholly the Armies, and caſt them in a new mould.</p>
            <p>Whereof the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners heairng, for their intereſt in the Common Cauſe, think fit for them to remember the Parliament of two things prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally upon the point; whereof the firſt was, That in the new mould wherein the Armies were to be caſt, care ſhould be taken to make choice of men of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience and ability, ſo far as was poſſible, to do the better the duties of the Service; for although now and then men ignorant of what they undertake, may do
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:56773:41"/>
perchance a thing well; yet it ſtands that it ſhould be ſo, not with reaſon, which muſt rule all actions.</p>
            <p>The next was, that diligent care ſhould be taken, for admitting none to employment in the Armies, but ſuch as were truſty and faithfull to the Cauſe now in hand, as it is expreſſed in the Nationall Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: wherefore, it was deſired, that every one em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, in teſtimony of his honeſty and faithfulneſſe to the Cauſe, ſhould take the Covenant publikely.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> took occaſion to give theſe advices to the Parliament, upon information given them, firſt, that divers new men, and of little or no experience, were preferred by indirect means, and were to be employed in places of command, for by ends: then, that there were divers likewiſe named for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment and employment, who not onely were ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to be enclining to Schiſmes and Sects; but alſo, profeſſed Enemies to what is expreſſed in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall Covenant concerning the Church, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, to the Common Cauſe we are all ſworn to.</p>
            <p>Theſe advices of the <hi>Scots,</hi> although they were not ſo much regarded as was needfull, yet they did produce this effect, that divers men of known worth and experience, were named to be kept in the new mould, although many were put out, and new men unknown for Military vertue put in their places.</p>
            <p>Next, after a great debate in the Houſes, it is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained that all the Commanders ſhould take the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, under pain of caſhiering, betwixt ſuch and ſuch a day: But how this Order is obſerved, I know not, I doubt it is not ſo well as it ſhould be: As for the common Souldiers, it was not to be preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon them, which makes men admire, not well knowing the reaſon of things, how that the priſoners Souldiers taken of the Enemy ſhould have the Oath tendred unto them, in token of their embracing the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:56773:41"/>
Parliaments party and cauſe, and theſe Souldiers of the Parliaments own ſide, are not to be tyed to the Oath of the Nationall Covenant: Further, all ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected men brought before the Committees, namely of examination, have the Oath put to them, which if they refuſe, they are cenſed <hi>Malignants;</hi> yet the Parliaments Souldiers are to be free from the Oath, if they pleaſe. Yea, many were aſtoniſhed to hear that it was debated in the Houſes, whether thoſe of the Armies ſhould be put to the Oath of the Solemn League, or no, whereunto the Houſes themſelves are ſworn to, and for the maintenance of which, we all now ſtand, or at leaſt we ought to ſtand, being ſworn to it.</p>
            <p>The reaſon why ſome men are backward to take the Oath, is that they are adverſe to the Government of the Church by Presbytery, which the Parliament is now a ſetling, although the buſineſſe do not go on ſo quickly as by many is wiſhed, by reaſon of ſo many rubs caſt in by ſeverall ſorts of men, partly through ignorance, partly in oppoſition to the thing, for reaſons far others then thoſe they hitherto have given out, howſoever ſpecious. At this occaſion, it was ſpoken publikely by one who is a prime man among thoſe who are adverſe from the Government above-named of the Church, that, although in his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he did not approve Presbyteriall. government in the Church, yet he, at all times, would ſubmit to whatſoever Church-government the Parliament ſhould ſettle, either by paſſive or active obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>To this is anſwered; Whoſoever ſayeth that he will obey an Order or Law by paſſive obedience, is already actively in diſobedience. Further, to call obedience paſſive, is as great an abſurditie, as to call black white: for obedience is nothing at all but the act
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:56773:42"/>
of obeying, and to call an act paſſive, is abſurd, action and paſſion being more different then black and white, for they are <hi>Toto genere,</hi> diſtant; and black and white are under <hi>Unum genus,</hi> not onely <hi>Summum</hi> of quality, but alſo ſubaltern of colour.</p>
            <p>Further, all vertue conſiſts in action; ſo obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence being a vertue, cannot be ſaid to be paſſive, that is, in paſſion. Wherefore, he who firſt did invent the expreſſion of paſſive obedience, did not weigh what he ſaid, no more then thoſe who ſince, not conſidering the exact diſtinction of things, have taken it up at the ſecond hand, and have made ſo generall uſe of it. He who thinks that, by his paſſion, he giveth obedience unto the Law, is mightily miſtaken; for, ſuffering, or paſſion, is laid upon a man for his not obeying, and to make him obey. Example: A man for debt is put in priſon; the empriſonment which the debtor ſuffers is not obedience to the Law, but one means employed to bring him unto the obedience thereof, that is, unto the paying of the debt. I know, Divines ſpeak much of the paſſive obedience of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> but this is of another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and ſo it belongs to another place. Beſides, he who offers unto the Houſes his paſſive obedience, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours what he can, and pleads earneſtly to be free from it, as we have ſeen publiſhed by writing. Then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, it was ſaid publikely by one, that the main quarrell the Parliament ſtood for at firſt, and thereafter did take up Arms for, was not for Religion (which is as much to ſay, the main different betwixt the Parliament and the corrupt Court-Papiſts, Prelatiſts, Atheiſts, and divers other inſtruments of iniquity, who having ſworn inimity to the Truth, oppoſeth it with all their cunning and power) not the Reformation of the Church; but, the freedom and Liberty of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
            <p>Which ſaying is injurious, in my mind; for, to
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:56773:42"/>
aver or publiſh, that the Parliament did not from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beginning intend a true Reformation of Religion, is a great wrong done to the Wiſdom of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for how can the Parliament be ſaid or thought to be wiſe in God, without it hath his fear before its eyes? and how can the Parliament be ſaid to have the fear of God before its eyes, if it hath not care of the eſtabliſhing the Truth of Religion, and to repreſſe the errors? I cannot conceive; for without the true Worſhip of God, there can be no true fear of him: then it is moſt falſe; for, from the firſt beginning, did not the Parliament expreſſe, that it namely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended a true Reformation, by divers inſtances, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though now and then it hath been at a ſtand how to go through with it, by reaſon of the lets that the Enemies of the Truth have caſt in, and caſt ſtill in to this day, by open oppoſition, and clandeſtine undermining? witneſſe the pulling down of the high Commiſſion-Court, the courbing of the Prelats tyranny, the making ſilenced Miniſters freely preach; and ſo ſoon is the occaſion offers it ſelf, is it not embraced, to throw the Prelats out of the Church as Enemies to the Truth of God? Then the calling of the Synod: which things, with divers more, the Parliament had never done, if it had not intended mainly the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Church and of Religion.</p>
            <p>I muſt confeſſe, the buſineſſes in the Synod did go on but very remiſly, before the <hi>Scots</hi> joyning, by the Nationall Covenant, with the Parliament, who hath ſince preſſed it ſomewhat more home; and yet it goeth on but very ſlowly, not ſo much by the open oppoſition of the profeſſed Enemy, as by the crafty infinuations of ſome phantaſticall and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious men, who having endeared themſelves by ſome expreſſion of good offices to the people, have buzzed the Parliament in the ear, they muſt not
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:56773:43"/>
anger them for fear of loſing ſo many good Friends, who give themſelves out to be in great number, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though if things were tryed, it ſhould be found that their number is far ſhort of what is ſaid of it, and their affection to the publike leſſe; for, I ſhall never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, that thoſe who are for confuſion in the Church, are for the ſetled ordering of the State.</p>
            <p>Further, if the Parliament did not make Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion at firſt its main quarrell it ſtood for, and took Arms for, I pray you then, when did the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment begin to make the Reformation of the Church its main quarrell, at the joyning of the <hi>Scots</hi> by the Nationall Covenant, perhaps you will ſay? If ſo be, when <hi>England</hi> hath a ſetled Reformation of the Church, according to the Word of God, the practice of the firſt ages, and of the beſt Reformed Church now adayes, it may thank their poor Friends diſtreſſed at this time for their ſake.</p>
            <p>I am aſſured, he that ſayeth that the Parliament did not intend mainly Reformation from the beginning, careth but little for it himſelf. Next, he makes the main quarrell of the Parliament to be the freedom and Liberty of the Subject: If under the notion of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Liberty, were underſtood firſt a free &amp; libr<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> profeſſion of the Truth in a ſetled Reformed Church, as aforeſaid, it were well; and in the ſecond place, the honeſt freedom and juſt Liberty in externall things; Such is the freedom that the truely reformed Churches abroad, have conſtantly ſought for to this day, who when they obtain the firſt, they ſtand not ſo much upon the ſecond. But, let us ſee a little what can be the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the freedom and Liberty of the Subject, without Religion: Is it to be free from the vexation of Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polies, Projects, Ship-moneys, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and of ſome exorbitant courſes of Judicatory, as of that of the Star-Chamber?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:56773:43"/>
If in thoſe alone, and no other things, better and more, I beſeech you, what benefit hath the Subject by the freedom from the Court of the Star-chamber? The people ſay, The Committees of one City or County, doeth more wrong in one yeer to the City or County, then the Starchamber-Court did to the whole Kingdom in ſeven yeers, if all things be well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered; for it did reach but one man here and there; but the Committees reach almoſt every man. It is true, the wounds of the Star-chamber were very ſore &amp; deep, but they were not ſo frequent, and now then they were mollified by ſome moderation; which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Committees will not admit.</p>
            <p>As for the freedom from Ship-money, Monopolies, Projects, <hi>&amp;c. Vox populi,</hi> ſayeth, there be more in taxes and contributions laid upon the people in one yeer, now adayes, then for many yeers in Ship-money, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yea, which is the worſt, this burden muſt continue, God knows how long, beſides the way of levying it by the inferior Officers, if the taxes are moſt grievous; and the beſt affected men, for the moſt part, are moſt loaden; ſuch is the cry and complaint of the people through the City and County.</p>
            <p>So, if the Subject had not the gain of a Reformed ſetled Church and Religion, he were in a worſe caſe then formerly. Next, there is found but very little more juſt and honeſt Liberty for the Subject, then before; onely the Sectaries take greater licence then they were wont to do, and phantaſticall men, to vent their idle imaginations, and to abuſe the ſimpler ones; as likewiſe ſcurrilous fellows take upon them to ſay and write what they liſt againſt men.</p>
            <p>All this is a meer licentiouſneſſe and libertinage tending to the trouble of the people, and not to their good, ſo far is it from the Liberty of honeſt and diſcret
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:56773:44"/>
men, who deſireth and ought to live, within the borns of good and wholſome conſtitutions both of Church and State.</p>
            <p>What is ſaid here of taxes, is not to blame them, for it is known ther muſt be tribute levied for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting of the burdens of the Common-Wealth, namely, in time of War, for its good and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit.</p>
            <p>At the beginning of theſe Wars here in <hi>England,</hi> betwixt the King and Parliament, both parties did draw unto them ſo many of the <hi>Scots</hi> Officers as they could conveniently; neither of them having in their own opinion ſuch Commanders, or, at leaſt, in ſuch number as to make their Armies compleat to their mind, of their own men.</p>
            <p>So the <hi>Scots</hi> were employed in chief and prime places of command, on both ſides: hence divers men indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, not as yet engaged by affection to either party, conceiving that neither party could have known how to manage, or go on with the War, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>Scots</hi> Commanders, wiſhed them many miles beyond S<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n.</p>
            <p>To the King went and took Service of him, not onely divers who had been <hi>Malignants</hi> from the firſt beginning; but alſo, ſome ſuperficiall Covenanters, who not diving in buſineſſes, did make ſmall ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pule to ſerve the King in this War, it not being againſt the Letter of their Covenant, as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: for, the King proteſting from day to day, that he would ſtand firm to the true Religion, and maintain it, his intention in taking up Arms, being onely to repreſſe ſome factinus perſons who had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted him: and the Parliament not then making it ſo clear to every one, by their expreſſions, that the main quarell the adverſary had, was the ſubverſion of Religion, made ſome not to diſcern things ſo clearly
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:56773:44"/>
as otherwayes they had done, if things had been more plainly ſet down.</p>
            <p>To the Service of Parliament, come divers in good affection, being perſwaded that the quarrell of <hi>England,</hi> was one and the ſame with that in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> howſoever by the cunning of the adverſary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed, and although not then ſo cleared by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as was need.</p>
            <p>The Enemy ſeeing that ſundry <hi>Scots</hi> Officers and Commanders were undertaking Service under the Parliament, by his Emiſſaries up and down, doeth what he can to draw them on his ſide, or at leaſt, to make them keep off from ſerving the Parliament. In this, he did prevaile with ſome, who will have their juſt reward in due time.</p>
            <p>Then, after the War began, and ſome Field<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions being done, the Enemy perceiving how that divers <hi>Scots</hi> Officers had carried themſelves gallantly, in the Service of the Parliament, returns again to his former courſes, and deales by his Inſtruments and Agents here, to corrupt and debauche thoſe men of Command, upon whom the eyes of many were; the Agents of the Enemy go craftily to work, to compaſſe their ends upon thoſe men; for, firſt, by cunning inſinuations, they enter in privacy with them; Next, they make them fair promiſes, with ſpecious words of the Kings good intentions to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the publike good of both Church and State, and of the eſteem he had of their worth and deſerts: Then thoſe good Agents for the Enemy, under-hand cauſe give diſtaſte to the <hi>Scots</hi> Officers, by neglecting of them, and otherwayes, yea, by ſome <hi>Boutefeux</hi> there were of them quarelled in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> with reproch that they took the Meat out of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> months, who could manage and purſue the War as well, atleaſt, as they.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:56773:45"/>
If this quarell had not been timely taken up, by the Wiſdom of the Parliament, it had grown to a great hight, according to the deſigne and deſire of the Enemy.</p>
            <p>This crafty dealing of the adverſary, by his Agents, did prevaile ſo far, that ſome of the <hi>Scots</hi> Officers, not ſo touched with the intereſt of the good Cauſe, as they ought to have been, nor as they outwardly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, left off the Service of the Parliament for a time, upon I know not what fooliſh excuſe; and thereafter, upon a change, fell to the Work again. Next, there were others ſo far perſwaded, as to lay down their Commiſſions, and go to the Enemy and ſerve him for a while; and thereafter leaving him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned hither again.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> Officers with the Enemy, were in high eſteem, and in good reſpect among thoſe they did ſerve, till the State of <hi>Scotland</hi> joyned with the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> in action for the Common Cauſe; from thence, by little and little, the <hi>Scots,</hi> with the Enemy, became ſo to be neglected and ill thought of, that there were many of them conſtrained to go away, and others have been taken and killed by this ſide, ſo that, for the preſent, there be very few, at leaſt of any note, with the Enemy.</p>
            <p>On this ſide likewiſe, the <hi>Scots</hi> Officers, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the State of <hi>Scotland</hi> was now intereſſed and joyned with the Parliament, by degrees came to be littler regarded, neglected, and divers of them laid aſide, after that ſundry of them had loſt their lives, fighting valiantly for the Cauſe, others had looſed their blood, and others ſuffered impriſonment, at laſt; the Moulders of the new Modell caſhier at one daſh above two hundred of them, brave fellows, who conſtantly had carried themſelves with honeſty, and gallantry, without giving them any ſatisfaction,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:56773:45"/>
or at leaſt, very little, for what is juſtly due unto them, and had coſt ſome of them very dear: The reaſon given out againſt them, was, That it was to be feared they would not be ſo earneſt and ſo forward, as was required, in this new frame.</p>
            <p>Then, thoſe caſhiered <hi>Scots</hi> Commanders having danced attendance a long time, to ſmall purpoſe, in purſuance of their juſt demands, conſtant to their grounds, although they were thus harſhly uſed, they would not abandon the Service of the Common Cauſe: ſo, they reſolve to go to the Forces of their Countrey-men, and ſerve with them in the ſame Cauſe; and ſends ſome of them, accompanied with a number of good fellows before, towards the <hi>Scots</hi> Army, till the reſt were ready.</p>
            <p>Thoſe <hi>Scots</hi> who went away firſt towards their Countrey-men, being upon their journey, they chanced to be at and neer <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> when the Enemy made his approches to that place. The <hi>Scots,</hi> in meer kindneſſe and love to thoſe who were engaged with them in the Common Cauſe, without any Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from the Parliament, or from the <hi>Scots</hi> Generall, ſtay and help their Friends: and how manfully their carriage was, in the aſſiſtance of their Brethren, is ſo known, that it will never be forgotten, when there is any mention of <hi>Leiceſter-buſineſſe.</hi> In generall, I will ſay this of them; That, if they had been ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded, the Town of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> had not been taken by the Enemy; but, having expected aſſiſtance from thoſe whom they came to help, after divers had proda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galized their blood, and that ſome were killed, with the loſſe of their Liberty and of all they had, they were conſtrained to yeeld to force, not without being admired by the vainquors for their valour. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, thoſe that were taken priſoners, finding their opportunity, lays hold on it at the firſt, and they
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:56773:46"/>
carry the buſineſſe ſo, that they not onely gaine their own freedom, but make themſelves Maſters of thoſe in whoſe hands they were.</p>
            <p>If thoſe things had been done by ſome other men, all the Pamphlets about the City of <hi>London,</hi> ſhould have been full of them.</p>
            <p>In this buſineſſe, albeit the <hi>Scots</hi> did expreſſe their kindneſſe really to their Friends, and made known their valour to all; Yet, here, I muſt tell you, they did not ſhew their prudence; for, if the Enemy had known them to have no Commiſſion, (as they had none) by Law of Arms, he had given them no quarter.</p>
            <p>On the one ſide, the ignorance of the Enemy did hinder him to deal with the <hi>Scots,</hi> being in his power, according to the rigour of the Law of Arms; On the other ſide, their valour and kindneſſe, did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile little for thanks or recompenſe, from thoſe, for whoſe Service they had undergone ſuch ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard.</p>
            <p>When the Framers of the new Modell caſhiered the <hi>Scots</hi> Officers we have been ſpeaking of, they named four Generall Officers of the <hi>Scots</hi> to be kept in the new Army; which ſome did for the good opinion they had of the worth and uſefulneſſe of thoſe men, for the Service: Others did it, leſt the people ſhould enquire, why all the <hi>Scots,</hi> at one time; ſhould be thus put out of Service, whoſe faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe and forwardneſſe was known, being free of the guilt of the late miſcarriage of things in the Fields.</p>
            <p>Thoſe few Officers, although they were named to be kept in the new Modell; they did conceive, that they had tacitcly their <hi>Quienis eſt,</hi> firſt, by caſhiering their Countrey-men, who were known to be well deſerving and faithfull men unto the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, (which is the Rule of that we fight for) and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:56773:46"/>
by naming them to inferior employments in this new Modell, to what they had come to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to by their own vertue. Next, by bringing in new men, not acquainted with War, in equall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand with them, and under them, and ſome of theſe profeſſed not to favour the Covenant, unto which the <hi>Scots</hi> were reſolved to ſtick to: So they thought ſit to take the courſe of their other Countrey-men, and to lay down their Commiſſions, for fear of further inconvenience, namely, if any miſchance ſhould fall out, apprehending the blame ſhould be caſt upon them; and then, they could not expect true fellowſhip not obeying to Orders in the Service, of thoſe men, who had another-mind then theirs, which is expreſſed in the Covenant.</p>
            <p>The diſobedience thereafter of ſome, in the new Modell, to the expreſſe Ordinances of Parliament, made this apprehenſion good.</p>
            <p>Upon this, there is a great cry given out againſt thoſe few <hi>Scots,</hi> who had abandonned the Service at ſuch a time of need; but never a word how that two hundred <hi>Scots</hi> had been put of the Service.</p>
            <p>Here, it may be asked, Whether thoſe few <hi>Scots</hi> were more in the wrong to the publike Service, by laying down their Commiſſions, ſerving ſtill the ſame Cauſe, with thoſe who are conſtant to their principles with them; then thoſe who put off the Service, at one time, two hundred valiant and well deſerving men.</p>
            <p>I could have wiſhed, for my part, that thoſe few men had laid aſide all conſideration and apprehenſion, howſoever juſt, and continued in the Modell, leaving the event of things to God.</p>
            <p>Now, it is ſaid, that God hath bleſſed the hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty and piety of ſome men extraordinarily, in the new Army, ſo that great things are done by it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:56773:47"/>
I acknowledge with a thankfull heart to God, that he, in his Mercy, hath done great things of late by that Army; but, no thank to the honeſty and piety of ſome men; for, I do not find piety more really in them, to ſpeak with modeſty, then in other men: Howſoever their externall profeſſion is, let their carriage towards God and Man ſpeak for them, and not profeſſion onely; for, profeſſion oftentimes is a clock of knavery and faction.</p>
            <p>Then, howſoever God, in his good Providence, doth great things by weak and inconſiderable men; yet, I am certain, it is the ſureſt way to employ men of skill and of experience, in any work we are going about; and ſurely, we cannot look for a good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of any buſineſſe whatſoever, when we neglect to employ thoſe whom God hath fitted with ability for the work, if we can have ſuch.</p>
            <p>I know, God is above all rule; but this is the ordinary courſe, both with God and among men; the examples are ſo clear in all buſineſſes among the Sons of men, that it is idle to alleadge any; onely I ſhall ſay, that there is more of this choice of fit men to be remarked in the War, then in any other thing among men, as it hath been obſerved of old, by judicious men: Yet God, in War, more then in any thing elſe, ſheweth his over-ruling power, and that he is above the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary courſe of things. But, to put God to ſhew here his over-ruling hand, in a extraordinary way, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out need, is a kinde of tempting of him; for, ſince he hath, in his wiſe Diſpenſation, ordained an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary courſe for doing of buſineſſes, to be uſed by men fitted by him for the work, he promiſed tacitely his bleſſing thereunto, providing alwayes that we rely more upon him, then the ſecond cauſes.</p>
            <p>More, in all this ſucceſſe there was never more ſeen of God, and leſſe of men; and thoſe men who would
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:56773:47"/>
make men beleeve, that their honeſty and piety ſhines above others, have but ſmall ſhare in action, for any thing I can yet hear.</p>
            <p>A word more: It was not without a myſtery, that ſo many gallant Officers of both Nations, were caſhiered under pretext of want of piety and honeſty, being free of any guilt of the former miſcarriages; and yet the ordinary Souldiers kept ſtill in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, whoſe piety is known to be leſſe, as men of little and ſmall breeding, and ſo, of leſſe knowledge of God and of themſelves, and conſequently, not ſo given to the practice of goodneſſe, and ſo abſtract from evil; having but ſmall light, they cannot do ſo well as others, who have better breeding then they; and, upon miſtake, they may more eaſily be brought over to do what is amiſſe, for themſelves and for others, yea, for the publike Service of Church and State, and ſo become a prey to abuſers and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers.</p>
            <p>Moreover, there is a great ſtir about <hi>Carlile,</hi> now in the hands of the <hi>Scots,</hi> for the Service of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. For the better underſtanding of things, we ſhall take them at a further riſe.</p>
            <p>So long as theſe two Kingdoms were under two ſeverall Princes, <hi>Carlile</hi> and <hi>Berwick</hi> were two Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon-Towns upon the Frontiers; but ſo ſoon as theſe Kingdoms did come unto one Princes hands, thoſe places were ordered to be forſaken, and their fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions raſed, and to be no more a partition-wall; which was done accordingly, and ſo they remained for many yeers, till of late, that is, till the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the firſt troubles of the <hi>Scots</hi> with the abuſed King, who cauſed then repair thoſe places in ſome kinde, and put Garriſons in them.</p>
            <p>Thereafter, at the firſt pacification upon the Frontiers, betwixt the King and the <hi>Scots,</hi> thoſe
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:56773:48"/>
places were to be relinquiſhed, as they had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly.</p>
            <p>By the Articles of agreement, at the ſecond pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cification, the ſame was confirmed, and that by the Authority of this ſame Parliament, now ſitting, <hi>gathered together, continued and preſerved by the help and aid of the Scots.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King, beginning his barbarous War againſt the Parliament, makes <hi>Carlile</hi> ſure, which by degrees inſenſibly he furniſheth with a ſtrong Gariſon &amp; Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition accordingly, as a place fit for his purpoſe, for vexing of the <hi>Scots,</hi> upon occaſion, whom he did fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee would not ſide with him in this wicked de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, if they were not oppoſite unto him; and for receiving his <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebels, to do miſchief to both Kingdoms as they pleaſed, if they were not ſtopped. And ſo, ſince then, he hath kept it, till within theſe few dayes; and it hath ſerved for a ſeat and a paſſage for troubling both Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>The Houſes of Parliament, on the other ſide, a little latter, poſſeſſe themſelves of <hi>Berwick,</hi> which the King did not regard ſo much, as not ſo conſiderable for his purpoſe, and alſo, it was too much in the eyes of men to be ſeiſed upon, by him, at the firſt beginning.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Scots</hi> come into <hi>England,</hi> at this time, to help their Brethren, who had been ſo kinde unto them in their troubles, and whoſe Fathers had aſſiſted their Fathers, in the Cauſe of Reformation and Liberty; by agreement betwixt the Parliament and them, they had <hi>Berwick</hi> delivered up unto them, for facilitating their entrie, and advancing the Service they engaged themſelves in: and if <hi>Carlile</hi> had been in the power of the Parliament then, it had been delivered unto the <hi>Scots,</hi> without any more ado, as freely as <hi>Berwick</hi> was for the very ſame reaſon. Yea, more, if it
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:56773:48"/>
had been required then, it had been promiſed unto the <hi>Scots:</hi> I do not mean of neceſſity; but of meer conſideration to the publike Cauſe.</p>
            <p>Now, the Northern Countrey of <hi>England,</hi> through Gods Mercy, being pretty well cleared, by the help of the <hi>Scots,</hi> of the open profeſſed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Common Enemy; it is thought fit, firſt to block up, and then to beſiege <hi>Carlile:</hi> The <hi>Scots</hi> undertake the buſineſſe, and to this purpoſe, ſent of their Army thither a party of both Horſe and Foot, under the command of a Generall Officer, and he hath ſome Forces of the Countrey to aſſiſt and help him, in the performance of the Service; which the <hi>Scots</hi> did not ſo hardly preſſe as to ſtorm the Town, for ſparing of blood, which they are loth to ſhed, if the buſineſſe can be carried on otherwayes, (witneſſe <hi>New-caſtle,</hi> where they ſhunned to ſhed blood, and being conſtrained to it, they did ſhed as little as ever hath been ſeen upon ſuch an occaſion) ſo they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to take the Town by want of neceſſary provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
            <p>Thoſe of the Countrey, who were joynt with the <hi>Scots</hi> in the Service, were ſo far from helping them, that, by the treachery of their Leaders, they did what they could not onely to hinder the buſineſſe; but alſo, to wrong the <hi>Scots</hi> in what was in their power; for, when they were ordered to keep their own quarters ſtrictly, and ſuffer nothing to go unto the Enemy; and if he fallied out of the Town, to fall upon him: they were ſo far from performing their Order, that when it was in their power to hurt the Enemy, they ſhot powder without bullets at him, and privately, they ſuffered proviſion to be carried unto him through their quarters; yea, by ſecret combination, they agreed with the Enemy, that if he would fallie out, and fall upon the <hi>Scots,</hi>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:56773:49"/>
quarters, they ſhould yeeld no help unto them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they were joynt with them in the Service.</p>
            <p>Which proceedings of the <hi>North</hi> Countrey-men, by the knavery of their Commanders, whereof the chief lately had been in open Rebellion againſt the Parliament, under the Earl of <hi>New-caſtle;</hi> being made known unto the <hi>Scots,</hi> they had a neerer eye to their actions, and oblige them thereafter to play fairer play: Thoſe falſe and deceitfull Leaders, ſeeing themſelves diſappointed of their former intents by the care of the <hi>Scots,</hi> go another way to work; and perceiving by the vigilance of the <hi>Scots,</hi> that the Town, receiving no help from without, muſt render it ſelf; underhand, and not acquainting the <hi>Scots,</hi> enter in a private Treaty with the Enemy, and offer him great conditions.</p>
            <p>This being alſo diſcovered by the <hi>Scots,</hi> cauſed them ſummon the Town, and offer to it reaſonable conditions, which the Enemy did accept, although they were not ſo advantagous for him, in all points, as thoſe offered by the others.</p>
            <p>The reaſon why the Enemy did accept the <hi>Scots</hi> conditions, and not the others, was, firſt, He could not truſt to any condition from thoſe who were ſo wicked, that they were not truſty to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty they profeſſed themſelves to be of, and to their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociates.</p>
            <p>Next, The Enemy ſeeing the chief man, among thoſe double ones, to be but an inferior Officer, and one who never had ſeen greater War then the plundering and ſpoiling of his own Countrey, under the Earl of <hi>New caſtle,</hi> with whom he had been a Lievtenant-Colonel at the moſt, and now at this time prefered, for ſome ends, to be a Colonell. Then, there was no Committee there who could authorize him to capitulate, or make good his capitulation,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:56773:49"/>
where the <hi>Scots</hi> were; for, by agreement betwixt the <hi>Scots</hi> and the Parliament, things of conſequence in the War, wherein the <hi>Scots</hi> had a hand, were to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by the Committee of both Kingdoms upon the place, or with the <hi>Scots</hi> Army, and that not being, (as there was none then) by the <hi>Scots</hi> Generall his Order; and ſo he ordained, according to the firſt agreement, Lievtenant Generall <hi>David Leſley</hi> to take in the Town, upon ſuch conditions as he ſhould think fit for the good of the publike Service, and put a Gariſon in it.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who came out of the Town, were condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted unto <hi>Worceſter,</hi> who were but ſix ſcore when they arrived thither, the reſt being fallen away in their march, either upon conſideration of the publike, or of their own private intereſt.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Carlile</hi> is put in obedience of the Parliament, for the publike Service, according to the firſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And if the <hi>Scots</hi> had not followed the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, in all appearance, it either had ſtill remained in the hands of open Enemies, or, at leaſt, had fallen in the hands of thoſe <hi>Malignants,</hi> who neither have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the credit of the Parliament, nor regard to the good of the people; for they diſhonour the one, and waſte the other.</p>
            <p>All the while that the Siege was before <hi>Carlile,</hi> there was not onely a neglect, but ſuch a malice againſt the <hi>Scots,</hi> who were at it, that they had ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for want, if the <hi>Scots</hi> Army had not ſent a good part of the moneys that they had for their marching and taking the Field. Thus is the publike ſerved by the Countrey-Committees, abuſing the Authority they have from the Parliament.</p>
            <p>After all this, the <hi>Scots</hi> are cryed out upon by <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants;</hi> yea, they write to the Houſes againſt them, as Enemies to the publike good, to the Parliament,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:56773:50"/>
and to the people of <hi>England,</hi> notwithſtanding that ſince the very firſt beginning of thoſe troubles they have carried themſelves faithfully, honeſtly, and kindly towards <hi>England,</hi> in deſpite of all Enemies, and particularly towards the Parliament, who were the cauſe of aſſembling it, continuing it, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving it, firſt, from the great Plot made againſt, next, by actively upholding it when it was very low, as it was at their in-coming.</p>
            <p>The reaſon why the <hi>Scots</hi> have put a Gariſon of their own men in <hi>Carlile,</hi> for a time, is from the conſtitution of the preſent affaires in both Kingdoms; for, having found ſuch knavery and wicked dealing, by the chief men in the Northern Countreys, they did not conceive it fit, for the publike Service, to put the place in the hands of thoſe, who already poſſeſſed with power (by the unfaithfull Commiſſioners, truſted by the Parliament with the ordering of things in thoſe places) do nothing but oppoſe the deſigne of the Parliament expreſſed in the Covenant, and oppreſſe the people, as is made known unto the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament by the Commiſſioners from thoſe Countreys, (men of credit and worth, who have done and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered much for the Cauſe againſt the Common Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my) ſent hither from many good people, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain againſt thoſe wicked ones, Enemies to God and to his people: And when it ſhall be thought fit for the Common good of both Nations, now ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it will with all cheerfulneſſe be left by the <hi>Scots;</hi> And to this, the State of <hi>Scotland</hi> will willingly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage it ſelf, by all the aſſurances can be require in reaſon.</p>
            <p>The Common Enemy, ſince he could not keep out <hi>Carlile</hi> in open War, againſt the Parliament, doth his next beſt to have it in the <hi>Malignants,</hi> his Friends, hands, that at leaſt indirectly, he may do his work;
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:56773:50"/>
and ſince he failed of both thoſe, he ſtriveth by his Emiſſaries and Agents to make it an Apple of diſcord betwixt the two united Nations: but, this will faile him alſo, how cunningly ſoever he goe's about this deſigne; for, the Wiſdom of both States is ſuch, that the miſtake will be taken away ſhortly, and that the State of <hi>England</hi> will ſee clearly, the <hi>Scots,</hi> in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing themſelves of <hi>Carlile,</hi> and excluding thoſe wicked ones above-mentioned, have not onely done a good peece of Service to the publike and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Cauſe of both Kingdoms; but alſo, in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, to the well-affected people in thoſe parts, who are under the heavy preſſure of thoſe wicked ones, and had been far more, if they had more power, whereunto the poſſeſſion of <hi>Carlile</hi> were ſuch an addition, that it would make them double Tyrants and Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gants.</p>
            <p>As the Common Enemy, not onely by open War by Land; but alſo, by falſe undermining by his Agents and Inſtruments, who partly are abſolutely addicted to his wicked deſigne, partly by intereſt of preferment and benefit, although they care but little for his ends in the Field, or in the Counſell, in the City or in the Countrey; do what they can, with all care and forecaſting, to ſtop the publike Service by many and many wayes; this is known too well to be ſo little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded: Even ſo, by Sea, he ſteereth the ſame courſe; for, not onely by open War he doeth oppoſe the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Work, now in hand, in taking and deſtroying all that he can; but likewiſe, he uſeth indirect means by the help of his Inſtruments, for the hinderance of the Service of the Common Cauſe, now in hand.</p>
            <p>Hence it is that the Parliaments Ships, not ſo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly oppoſing the Enemy, and not giving timely aſſiſtance to their Friends, intereſſed in the Cauſe;
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:56773:51"/>
ſo many of the Enemy his Ships, without reſiſtance, go up and down ſo freely, and that there are ſo many Ships, Barks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> both <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> taken by the Enemies.</p>
            <p>Further, the Coaſts of <hi>Scotland</hi> are not ſo carefully garded and kept, as they were promiſed to be, by agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which hath given and giveth ſtill a great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the Enemy, and hath done a great hurt to the Friends who are employed in the Cauſe againſt the Enemy, and, in them, to the Service of the Cauſe.</p>
            <p>Theſe things have given occaſion of complaints to many men, bemoaning their own condition, and how that the good of the people and the Service of the Common Cauſe, are no more and better looked to; yea, ſome in grief of heart, after their great ſufferings, hardly taken notice of by thoſe of whom they expect ſome redreſſe, ſay that not onely there is a great neglect, but, in appearance, there is ſome ſecret connivence, by thoſe who ſhould follow this Service. But to another buſineſſe:</p>
            <p>It is known to every one, almoſt, how that for many and many dayes and meetings, there hath been a great deal ado in the Synod, with ſome few factious and phantaſticall head-ſtrong ones (men without love to the Peace of the Church of God) for the Government of the Church by Parochi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Presbyteries, ſubaltern to Claſſicall, and Claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicall ſubaltern to Synodicall; which all being, after ſo many debates with Patience, Goodneſſe, and Charity towards thoſe men, demonſtrated evidently to be according to the Word of God, wherein it is grounded, conform to the practice of the Church planted and governed by the Apoſtles and their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, for above two hundred yeers after <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and conform likewiſe, to the beſt Reformed Churches now adayes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:56773:51"/>
But, at length, the thing is concluded upon by the Synod, and approved by the Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, maugre all oppoſition made by the diſturbers of the Peace of the Church, in the Synod, and of the ſticklers for them any where elſe. Yet, thoſe reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſe ſpirits will not be quiet; for, they give out, that they will perform at laſt the thing they have been ſo much urged to, and for ſo long a time; to wit, they will give unto the Publike, the Modell of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment they would be at, &amp; to which they will ſtand to: But, thoſe who have a ſhrewd gheſſe at thoſe men, and at their wayes, aſſure us, that, as they will not tell what they abſolutely and poſitively profeſſe, nor what they would be at; they will never give a ſet Modell of Government unto the Publike, whereunto they mind to ſtand:</p>
            <p>For, whatſoever they do in oppoſition of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment above named, they cannot agree among themſelves unto any one thing, for, ſo many heads ſo many wayes diſſonant one from another, according to the nature of untruth and errour, which is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and not conſtant to it ſelf. Yea, there be ſome who ſay, That thoſe men will not ſettle upon any thing at all, except it be upon continuing in phrenati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Fancies; and thoſe of the moſt exacter ſort amongſt them, are named <hi>Seekers,</hi> not of God, or his Truth, and of Peace; but of themſelves and of novelties, at the beſt; which ever hath, and will be troubleſome to the Peace of the Church.</p>
            <p>Truely, as thoſe factious ones, by rejecting all dependancy, and ſubalternation of inferior Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytereis to ſuperior, in Church-government, have acquired unto themſelves the Name of <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents;</hi> ſo, if you caſt your eyes upon the courſes of thoſe mens ſeeking of preferment and benefit, they may juſtly all be called <hi>Seekers:</hi> For, there was never
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:56773:52"/>
a generation, among men, ſo nimble and ſo active about preferment and benefit, as thoſe men are. The Jeſuites are far ſhort of them, howſoever cryed up through the world for this; for, they run up and down with care and cunning to lay hold on power and moneys, wherin they have come to good ſpeed by their crafty inſinuations, and the ſillineſſe of other men: Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of all ranks, not excepting the higher amongſt men, ſeeing their wayes advantageous, ſide and cog in with them, for profit and employment. They, on the other ſide, receive none in their Society but thoſe of means and gifts; poor people and ſimple are profane in their account: They work hugely with rich mens wives, widdows, and daughters; and ſtirring fellows, in any kinde are good for them: And to carry on their buſineſſe more ſmoothly, they plead for cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that there may be a charitable interpretation of their carriage and proceeding, when God knows, they are deſtitute of all charity, firſt towards the Church, in generall, whoſe peace they diſturbe in a high mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and towards particular men, for they oppreſſe and afflict every honeſt man they can reach, in hatred to faithfulneſſe unto the good of the Church and State, if all were well known and conſidered; for thoſe who ſtrive ſo much for confuſion in the Church, aime all Anarchie in the State, doubtleſſe. It is true, there be divers ſimple well meaning men that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnared in the opinion of thoſe men, of Church-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; but, good people, who are not of the Cabale, nor of the ſecret faction; who, I doubt, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on fuller information, will leave the error, and follow the Truth. So there be many honeſt and well mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing people, who adhere and follow the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> who are not acquainted with the myſteries of their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</p>
            <p>Then, with a great deal of deceit, they cry out
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:56773:52"/>
igainſt the rigidneſſe of Presbyteriall-government, as aforeſaid, to make the people beleeve that it will tye them to ſuch a ſtrictneſſe and rigidity, or auſterity, that all Chriſtian Liberty will be taken away from them. Wherein they do lye moſt abominably againſt the practice of all the Reformed Churches where this Government hath place, namely in <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> where if there be any thing amiſſe of this kinde, it is towards lenity rather then auſterity.</p>
            <p>Yet, thoſe fellows give out, that they are more holy then other men, and of a ſtricter life, and will not admit to their Society any who will not bind himſelf to the ſtrictneſſe they profeſſe externally; but, their carriage, being neer looked to, will be found as far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from what they profeſſe, as the <hi>Capuchins</hi> hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie is from true piety.</p>
            <p>The buſineſſe is no ſooner ended concerning the Church-government, maugre <hi>Independents,</hi> but there ariſe other difficulties and rubs in the way, to hinder the ſetling of Government: Such obſtacles are caſt in by the Enemy, to ſtop the building of the Temple:</p>
            <p>Firſt, Some will not allow it to be of divine right, notwithſtanding it is demonſtrated to have its ground in the Scripture, ſo clearly that it cannot be denyed, and practiſed by the Apoſtles and their ſucceſſors.</p>
            <p>Then, There is a great ſtir concerning the power of the Presbytery, to admit and keep off people from the Table of the Lord; and to receive men unto the Communion of the Church, or to ſeclude them from it: Which power ſome will have to be onely in the Civill Magiſtrate: Wherein there is a great miſtake. From the beginning of the World to the giving of the Law, both functions of the ſpirituall Miniſtery con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God and Religion, and of the civill Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery concerning the externall Society of men, being
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:56773:53"/>
in one man, to wit, in the Father, and the eldeſt Son in the Fathers room; things were not ſo clearly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct: But then, at the giving of the Law, God in his appointed time, and in his wiſe diſpenſation, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained the functions of his ſpirituall Miniſtery of Church, and of the civill Miniſtery of State, to be in diſtinct perſons; ſo the power belonging ſeverally to each Miniſtery was to be exerciſed diſtinctly by thoſe who were ſet aſide ſeverally, for the ſeverall Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: And that the one Miniſter had power over the things concerning his Miniſtery, as the other over his, it is clear by Scripture.</p>
            <p>Thus, things did continue from <hi>Moſes</hi> to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though now and then not without ſome alteration or change, by reaſon of the revolutions of affaires, in the State of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and of <hi>Judah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Chriſtian Church, the diſtinct Miniſteries being in diſtinct perſons, the power belonging to the ſeverall Miniſteries, muſt be in diſtinct perſons, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Miniſteries; and although the civill Magiſtrate, or Miniſter of State, is not to exerciſe the ſpirituall Miniſtery, nor what belongeth to it; yet he is obliged to overſee the Miniſter of ſpirituall things, to do his duty faithfully and diligently. Of thoſe, much hath been ſaid and written in former times, and of late, by men of the cleareſt judgement, and of moſt underſtanding in things of this nature. Beſides, the fear of men, that the ſpirituall Scepter and rod of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould be prejudiciable to their wordly authority, the frequent encroaching of the Miniſters of the Church upon the civill Miniſter, to wave what is done elſewhere, and hath been in former times here in thoſe Iſlands, not onely of old, but in thoſe latter yeers, Churches-Miniſters, ambition, &amp; avarice, having caſt us in all thoſe troubles; doth furniſh juſt occaſion of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſſe to the civill Magiſtrate, to keep the Miniſtery &amp;
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:56773:53"/>
power of Church men within the precinct of the Church; but it muſt not be ſo as to make them like the trencher-Chaplain, to ſay a ſhort grace and no more.</p>
            <p>As the Church Miniſters are not to meddle with civill affaires, ſo the civill Miniſters ought not to meddle with things meerly ſpirituall; ſuch are the cenſures of the Church, which is commonly called the power of the keyes.</p>
            <p>Further, as Prelats with their Emiſſaries, have put <hi>Chriſt</hi> out of his Throne in a kinde, making themſelves Lords and Maſters of his Flok and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritage; ſo on the other ſide, thoſe who take away the due power of the keyes from the Miniſters of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his Church, doth him a great deal of wrong in his ſpirituall Kingdom. Therefore, let us look to it, leſt when we have pulled down one tyranny Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian out of the Church, we do not leave it to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and Anarchie, and ſo to be inſlaved to the phancie and to the humour of weak men. But of this, let it ſuffice in this place.</p>
            <p>Moreover, as the <hi>Scots</hi> did conſtantly in all their own troubles ever from the beginning to this day, lay hold upon all the occaſions they could meet withall, to try if it were poſſible by fair means to redeem the miſled King from his evil wayes, and to calm all things with the leaſt noiſe or ſtir that could be; ſo it hath been their conſtant courſe here, both before and ſince their conjunction in action with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in this Common Cauſe, to try by fair means, if the King could be prevailed with, for his own good and that of the people; and now at this time, after ſo many ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages obtained of late upon the adverſe party, they have thought it fit to deſire the Parliament to ſend to the King, to try him yet again, if at laſt he will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to what is fitting in reaſon and conſcience for the ſetling of Church and State, as it hath been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:56773:54"/>
unto him, with a ripe deliberation, after a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious debate, and laying aſide all evil Counſell, where with he hath been ſo long miſled, come home to the Parliament, the great Counſell of the Land.</p>
            <p>This advice of the <hi>Scots,</hi> as it is liked by the wiſer and better ſort of men, who have mainly the publike Service before their eyes; ſo, by the hotter kinde of people, who breath nothing but violence and extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, it is cryed out upon as prejudiciable unto the Common Cauſe, and will give an advantage to the Enemies, ſince the King is not to be reclaimed by fair means, and will never yeeld to reaſon but upon meer neceſſity.</p>
            <p>It is but too true, I am aſſured, and I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe there be but very ſmall hopes of doing any good with the King, or gaining any good upon him in that way; for, beſides that nothing hath been gained by all the former Meſſages ſent to him, or by Treaties with him, the violation of the Peace made twice with the <hi>Scots,</hi> the many Plots both in <hi>Scotland</hi> and in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to undo all, the bloody buſineſſes in <hi>Ireland,</hi> the laſt intercepted Letters, wherein he expreſſeth his mind, and the intelligence we have from all places abroad, tells us ſufficiently that he will continue ſtill in this perſecuting way of Church and State, ſo long as he can hold out. The reaſon of this his perſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in thoſe courſes, is clear to any rationall man, and it is this: There is a great deſigne now afoot in theſe Dominions, which is to bring all to ſpirituall and temporall ſlavery and thraldom more then it was in the blindeſt times; which will be kept up with all might and ſlight, ſo long as is poſſible; and the abuſed King, who is the chief Agent in this buſineſſe, will be kept to it and not ſuffered to give over the work, but go no ſo long as they who ſet him about it, can
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:56773:54"/>
furniſh him with any encouragement, by hopes, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, and intelligence, moneys, arms, or by any other aſſiſtances whatſoever, to keep life in the buſineſſe.</p>
            <p>Now, if you will ask who be thoſe who have ſet this great deſigne afoot, and have engaged the King in it, I will tell you, <hi>Rome, France,</hi> and <hi>Spaine:</hi> The <hi>Pope,</hi> to have all under him, at leaſt, as formerly: The <hi>Spaniard</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> firſt, both in reſpect of the Holy Father, as Chriſtian and Catholike Sons; then, each of the two hath his own private intereſt beſides: The <hi>Spaniard,</hi> by the means, hopes for a number of good Friends here, (the work ſucceeding) by reaſon of the common Catholicity, and to have <hi>Ireland</hi> ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely at his devotion, to ſide with him upon ſuch oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion as he ſhall require; for it is every where re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked, that the Popiſh of thoſe Dominions have a double doſe of <hi>Catholicon</hi> in their bellies, and to be <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh,</hi> and as they are addicted to the tyranny of <hi>Rome</hi> over the inward man, alſo they are affected to the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of <hi>Spaine</hi> over the outward man; ſo ingrate are they towards God, and ſo unnaturall towards their own Countrey.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> hath his particular intereſt in the work; for, ſince he could by no means get the King to ſide with him in oppoſing the <hi>Auſtrian,</hi> and to help his neereſt Allies and Confederates againſt his and their Enemies; in ſpleen and revenge, hath put many Irons in the fire to give work at home, to undo him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his people.</p>
            <p>Next, The <hi>French,</hi> by the putting the King to work at home, and by keeping him to it, goe's on with his own work againſt the <hi>Auſtrian,</hi> namely in <hi>Flanders,</hi> wherein theſe Dominions have the moſt intereſt to look to, by reaſon of the neerneſſe and the narrow Seas.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:56773:55"/>
Then, the <hi>French</hi> hath a further drift, who when he hath any leaſure from his Wars with the <hi>Auſtrian,</hi> either by an accommodation, or by an abſolute Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, he may ſend hither a party to make the <hi>Hola,</hi> with a vengeance, little to the content of either Prince or people; yea, to ſeek by a ſtrong hand that which the <hi>Norman</hi> offered to the then <hi>French</hi> King, and he refuſed.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the ſhares and parts that <hi>Rome, Spaine,</hi> and <hi>France</hi> take in our troubles, howſoever they give out otherwayes, for prove of this, to lay aſide many things which might be here alleadged:</p>
            <p>Firſt, for <hi>Rome,</hi> I pray you put before your eyes the conſtant and neer commerce the corrupt Court and the wicked Clergie have had with <hi>Rome,</hi> and have to this day, with the Letters betwixt the King and the <hi>Pope,</hi> and the ſending Agents hence to <hi>Rome,</hi> and from thence hither, and a <hi>Nuntio</hi> into <hi>Ireland,</hi> who is now ſo far as the neerer coaſts of <hi>France,</hi> in his way for <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next, for <hi>Spaine</hi> and its adherents in the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Cauſe, to ſay nothing of what is paſt in the kindling of the fire among us, by ſeverall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blowings: I pray you to conſider the Reſidents now of <hi>Caſtille, Portugall,</hi> of <hi>Venice, Florence, Lorraine, &amp;c.</hi> what their carriage is, how enclined to the Court, and how adverſe to the Parliament.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>France,</hi> The late <hi>Factotum</hi> of that Court, did acknowledge it to be one of his Maſter-peeces, to have kindled the fire in all thoſe Dominions, firſt in <hi>Scotland,</hi> next in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and laſt, a little before his death, in <hi>England;</hi> whereabout he had above a dozen of Agents at one time, acting their ſeverall parts in this act here with us. Thoſe who have ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in his place, carry on things his way very neer, namely, in what concerns us, as may appear by the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:56773:55"/>
ſending into <hi>Scotland,</hi> to hinder the <hi>Scots</hi> joyning with the Parliament, and by the continuall ſupplies which are ſent from <hi>France</hi> to the Enemies in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Reſidents of <hi>France</hi> their expreſſions in favour of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
            <p>All this is done really, albeit not avouched by publike Authority.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding that both <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> give out they will keep fair with the States of both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and indeed the commerce in ſome kinde is continued; but, they receive in their Sea-Towns Pyrates with the ſpoiles they take from both Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, who are now consederate in this Common Cauſe.</p>
            <p>Then ſome others, who, at firſt, although they had not perhaps put their hands to caſt us in thoſe troubles; yet, ſeeing us enclining thereunto, have put them forward, and have given help to our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries. Such are ſome of <hi>Holland,</hi> who, againſt the principles and grounds of their own State, have by their late Ambaſſadour, declared themſelves to be enſlaved to our corrupt Court, for their own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate intereſts, and for that of him who namely ſet them awork.</p>
            <p>When I ſpake of <hi>Holland, Spaine, France,</hi> yea, of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, I do not mean the common people; but of thoſe who have chief hand in affaires and in Government: for, God knows, the people of thoſe Countreys are as innocent of any evil office done unto us now, as our people were free from doing harm to the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King of <hi>Danemark</hi> would fain have had his hand in the buſineſſe; but he hath found other things to do.</p>
            <p>Yet, after all this, ſince we conſtantly pray for our
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:56773:56"/>
King both in publike and in private, if it were Gods will, to reclaim him unto himſelf; and then that we might have godly, ſober, and quiet life un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him; I ſee no reaſon why we ſhould not try up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all occaſion to regain him, leaving the event and ſucceſſe to God, as the favourable hearing of our prayers for the King, to God his ſacred will; which not being declared unto us upon the point, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it upon the condition of his good will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and not abſolutely as the ſalvation of our ſouls, concerning which he hath manifeſted his will, in his word, unto us.</p>
            <p>Now in this place, and at this time, I know it will be expected to have ſomewhat ſaid of the preſent condition of <hi>Scotland:</hi> So, to diſcharge this duty in ſome meaſure, I give you this Diſcourſe in few words, and as neer the truth as I can, being at ſuch a diſtance not having ſo full intelligence; which I pray you to take thus.</p>
            <p>The Common Enemy ſeeing himſelf diſappointed of effectuating, to his mind, his wicked deſigne by his enterpriſes of War, and his failing Plots in <hi>Scotland;</hi> then the <hi>Scots</hi> refuſing in <hi>England</hi> to ſerve him in this deſigne, as thereafter their helping the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and laſt of all, their aiding <hi>England</hi> when they were very low, againſt his bloody Agents; finds if it had not been for the <hi>Scots,</hi> he had not had ſuch rubs and obſtacles, and ſo had gone more freely on with his work: Wherefore, ſince the <hi>Scots</hi> were the onely, in a kinde, hinderers of his compaſſing of his deſigne, he thinks how to be revenged of them, and to make them leave off this active oppoſing of him and his deſigne. After many things propoſed and tryed to ſmall purpoſe, at laſt it is reſolved by the Court to ſend home the <hi>Malignant</hi> Lords, to ſee what they can do; whom, according to orders, go home, ſubmit to the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:56773:56"/>
State, and take the Covenant. Divers other <hi>Malignants</hi> who had been lurking in and about the Countrey, do the ſame, and ſo they make all their peace. More, there were other double minded Lords, who hitherto had carried themſelves ſo warily, albeit they were known to be diſaffected, yet the Laws of the Land could not lay hold on them, receiving a favourable inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation by the help of their kinred, Friends and Allies.</p>
            <p>At this time, a good part of the beſt affected men were employed abroad, either in <hi>England</hi> or in <hi>Ireland,</hi> what in action in the Field, and what in Counſell; and the military men, who had been moſt ſtirring in their own laſt troubles, were employed in either of theſe two places, and ſome were gone to <hi>France</hi> to ſerve that King in his Wars.</p>
            <p>The Countrey being thus emptied of men of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell and of buſineſſe, as alſo of men of War; the Agents for the Common Enemy bethink themſelves that they have fair occaſion to do ſomewhat for the deſigne they in their heart affect and follow: but to go more ſmoothly to work, they muſt be employed in the ſervice of the Countrey, which being emptied (as is ſaid) of honeſt and able men, did admit them, and was in a manner of neceſſity conſtrained to make uſe of them in the Counſell of State, and in divers others Aſſemblies, and in all Committees almoſt.</p>
            <p>This point being gained, reſolution is taken to make a party of ſome ſtirring men to go into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and the <hi>Weſt</hi> Iſlands are deſigned to be the only fit place, the chance being tryed ſo often before to no purpoſe, becauſe they were negligently kept; the Lords and chief men of thoſe parts being in <hi>England,</hi> with divers of the prime men of the Countrey: they pitch upon an <hi>Alexander Macdoneld</hi> nicnamed <hi>Kilkitterch,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>Little theef,</hi> an Epithet
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:56773:57"/>
fit for a man who lives on ſpoile and prey. This man as an outlaw had left <hi>Scotland,</hi> and gone over to <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> where he joyned with the Rebels, and fought for them againſt the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> for a time; and after ſome diſlike he leaves them, and joyns with the <hi>Scots,</hi> and bringeth ſome few hundereds of ſuch men as himſelf with him. The Generall receives him, and he ſerves the <hi>Scots</hi> againſt the Rebels for a while: he tells the Generall that he had a great mind to have pardon for his former errors, and make his peace with his native Countrey: the Generall undertakes it, but finds not the thing ſo eaſie to be done, and ſo ſoon, as he expected, by reaſon (as is given out) of the naughtineſſe of the man; others ſay more; truely there was a particular ſpleen that ſtopped it. At this, <hi>Macdoneld</hi> frets, and goe's back again to the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebels, who received him kindly, partly by reaſon of his activity, partly in regard of his new kinred with the Earl of <hi>Antrim.</hi> To be ſhort, reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution being taken to ſend over into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and that into the Iſles, choice is made of him, who having choſen out, from among the Rebels, ſome few hundreds of deſperate fellows what native <hi>Iriſh,</hi> what <hi>Scots</hi> habituated in <hi>Ireland,</hi> what Iſlanders and highlanders of his own humour and Friends, goe's for <hi>Scotland,</hi> and lands in the <hi>Weſt</hi> among the Iſles and hills, where he finds but little, if any oppoſition. At his thus arrivall without any rub, divers of his old ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance and outlawes with him, repair unto him; ſo he increaſeth his number: at the firſt, the buſineſſe was laught at: But, ſeeing the number did increaſe by thoſe men, it is thought fit to look after them. He that had moſt intereſt, was in <hi>England</hi> for the time, who upon the news, goe's home, and takes Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, with divers other Noble Gentlemen, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue the Enemy; but the purſuit was with ſuch ſlack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:56773:57"/>
that the Enemy gains daily ground, and his number increaſeth.</p>
            <p>By this time, <hi>Montroſſe</hi> who had ſecret correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with <hi>Macdoneld,</hi> upon advice, goe's privatly from the <hi>North</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> where he had beſtirred himſelf as in the <hi>South</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> but he had been repulſed by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> forces in thoſe parts, with few men <hi>incognito,</hi> and joyns with <hi>Macdonald.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The two being joyned, <hi>Montroſſe</hi> declares himſelf Generall of the party, and ſheweth his Commiſſion, with many fair pretences to ſtand for the Covenant, and to continue the Government of the Church as it is now ſetled, and alſo, to eaſe the people of the burthens laid upon them by ſome factious men: This he promiſeth, aſſiſted with Papiſts, Atheiſts, forſworn men, and outlaws; which he performeth much at the rate of him who ſet him a work, ſpoiling, burning, and ſlaying men, women, and children; in a word, uſing all kinde of barbarous dealing where he could be Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; yea, divers were not ſpared upon their beds.</p>
            <p>Then, thoſe Nobles and Gentlemen who had Commiſſion from the States of <hi>Scotland,</hi> go againſt the deſpicable Enemy, and the firſt rencounter was about the bridge of <hi>Jerne,</hi> where ſome betraying the Commiſſion they had, run to the Enemy, others aſtoniſhed fled away, and others ſell their lives at the deareſt rate they were able to do: ſo with a few, he had the better of a great number. The Enemy had another rencount a while thereafter, by the ſame way, and with the like ſucceſſe: After which his courage and number increaſed ſo, that the people began to apprehend and fear him.</p>
            <p>Upon this, the States ſend more men to help, and think fit to employ an old Officer to command in Chief againſt thoſe Rebels, who ſeeing this preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made againſt them, retire to the hills, and ſeeing
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:56773:58"/>
the Army of the Countrey could not ſtay altogether in one place, but muſt be divided into divers ſquadrons, the Enemy, from the hills, upon intelligence given him by <hi>Malignants</hi> of the Countrey in the Army, falls now and then upon Gentlemens houſes, Villages, and Towns, which he ſpoiles and makes a prey of, and ſometimes falls upon one quarter or other of the States Forces, where, although he found even honeſt men that fought moſt valiantly againſt him, and killed many of his men, yet, by the treaſon of ſome Commanders or others, for the moſt part, he hath come off with advantage; and now within theſe few dayes, he hath had the greateſt with a handfull of men. He never, to this day, could make up at one time three thouſand men, when the Countreys forces were together neer twice, thrice, yea four times his number.</p>
            <p>Although God be the Lord of Hoſts, and it is he that giveth wiſdom and reſolution for Victories; yet ſince men have a hand in this buſineſſe, we cannot but enquire if the men employed in the work have done their part according to their truſt and abilities where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with God hath inabled them.</p>
            <p>I know, that it is ordinary with people, (who riſe little higher then to men) when there is any good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe obtained by any, to adore him, and when things go amiſſe to lay the fault upon man, yea, perhaps, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame man whom they had a little before ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
            <p>Yet here, although I cannot ſay poſitively, there hath been a continued treachery in the carriage of things, by divers of the Officers, namely, by him that did command in Chief; there be ſhrewd pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions to gueſſe that there is a great deal of kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; as,</p>
            <p>Firſt, The great complaints of the honeſt and true
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:56773:58"/>
Commanders, who, being neereſt, could ſee beſt, and judge beſt of fair play or foul.</p>
            <p>Next, The poſture of the Countrey, when this party entred into the Land.</p>
            <p>Then, The correſpondence the Enemy hath with ſome of high note and employment in the Countrey, with the favour and connivence of others.</p>
            <p>Further, By the open treaſon of thoſe who have run unto him, although employed againſt the Enemy; yea, there be who have run unto him in the Field, when they ſhould have fought againſt him.</p>
            <p>More, The aſſurance that the <hi>Malignants</hi> had of Victory long before it came, at home, in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, here in <hi>England,</hi> and beyond Sea.</p>
            <p>To this exigence, with the now unſuffering barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Enemy and of falſe brethren, have honeſt men brought themſelves to; and the poor Countrey, who had carried on their own buſineſſe with ſuch reſolution and wiſdom, &amp; had kept under them the ſons of <hi>Belial</hi> and children of falſehood and lyes, that they durſt not grumble, but ſubmit quietly, for their kindneſſe to their Neighbours, among whom they have diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed themſelves for their Service, and for overplus, they are payed with ingratitude, neglects, yea ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies and affronts for their pains, by many of theſe people, for whom they have drawn all this upon them, and for whom daily they hazard and loſe their lives, when they might all this while have ſat at home quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: but, they hope that the ſame God, who ſet them firſt about his Work, for all this, will inable them in mercy to be ſtedfaſt to his Cauſe, for which they now ſo much ſuffer; will, at laſt, free them from trouble, and end the buſineſſe to his own glory and the good of his people, in deſpite of all malignancy and oppoſition whatſoever; for, when God hath chaſtiſed his own for a time, he will throw the ſcourge in the fire, and ſhew

them his great power in redeeming them from the hand of the wicked, upon whom the tempeſt of the Lord goe's forth, and the whole wind that hangeth over ſhall light upon their heads; yea, the fierce wrath of the Lord ſhall not return untill he have done and performed the intent of his heart upon his Enemies: and the Lord will ſay unto <hi>Iſrael, Thou People, who haſt eſcaped the Sword, haſt found Grace in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and I will go before thee to cauſe thee to reſt, for I have loved thee with an everlaſting Love; wherefore, with Mercy have I drawn thee, and I will make a new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with thee, thou haſt broken the old which I made with thee when I brought thee out of</hi> Egypt; <hi>and this ſhall be the new Covenant I will make with thee, I will put my Law in thine inward parts, and write it in thine heart, and thou ſhalt be my People, and I will be thy God.</hi> Let us therefore wait upon the Lord with patience, who will not faile in his promiſe, if we return unto him with true repentance for our ſins, and with a ſerious reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſtick conſtantly cloſe unto him, with our whole heart.</p>
            <p>There hath been of late a great bluſtering of ſome ſecret under-hand dealings with the Common Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, by ſome few men, without the knowledge of the publike; of which I have thought fit to ſay theſe few words; and to underſtand the thing more at length, we ſhall call to mind bow that the King, this laſt Winter, ſends hither his cajeoling Commiſſioners, who, according to their Order, did cajeole the <hi>Scots</hi> and the <hi>Independents;</hi> but, how far they prevailed then with the <hi>Independents</hi> by their cajeolerie, I cannot tell: but, I am ſure, they did not gain of the <hi>Scots</hi> the leaſt point of any thing, yea, not of any expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or thought of buſineſſe, which could be in any kinde interpreted to have an ill meaning in it againſt the Churches and States advantage, in the three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms;
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:56773:59"/>
as the <hi>Scots</hi> have made appear in their conſtant fair carriage, in all buſineſſe of Church &amp; State, maugre envie, namely in the laſt Treaty, where they did ſhew really what honeſty and faithfulneſſe they had in their heart, as I have ſaid before.</p>
            <p>The Treaty being ended without any agreement, the Court, after a time, ſends one hither; for, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he gives out that he ſtole away, yet he came with the knowledge of the Court; and things being tryed really, it may happily be found that he came hither by Order expreſſe, with inſtructions; who is a great cajeolor to uſe the Courts own words, that is, in plain language, a meer cheater, who hath vowed to cozen, by his lyes: This cajeolure, as the former two, endeavours, firſt, to cajeole the <hi>Scots;</hi> but, finding he had a cold coale to blow, he leaveth off the deſigne with them, and makes his addreſſes unto the <hi>Independents;</hi> but how he hath ſped with them, it is not as yet fully known, things not being manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but ſome fidling buſineſſes there have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him and them, whether or no, by the whole Cabale, or by ſome few of the prime of the faction, it is uncertain.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That there was ſome under-hand-dealing by them, the intercepted Letters of <hi>Digby</hi> unto <hi>Leg,</hi> give a ſhrewd proof of it.</p>
            <p>Next, The Papers found ſince in the cajeolors friends cloſet, under the cajeolors own hand.</p>
            <p>When theſe things are tryed to the full, we hope the light of all will appear, which all honeſt men wiſh it may be done exactly and ſpeedily: And till then, mens minds will not be ſatisfied, and they will hardly refrain to ſpeak of theſe things, howſoever it be taken; for they conceive not onely by the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the time they are free from the thraldom of the corrupt Court; but alſo, ſince they have intereſt in
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:56773:60"/>
the buſineſſe, and have hazarded all what they have or had for the publike Service, they may expreſſe their thoughts freely of occurrences, ſo it be with diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſparing mens perſons, till things be cleared: And ſincerely I think, no innocent man can be angry at this; if any in conſcience finds himſelf guilty in any kinde, that he will do well to ſuffer it patiently, for fear he ſuffer more, if things go exactly on to a triall.</p>
            <p>The light that happily may be found out of this, will not be and cannot be by a mathematicall or meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſicall demonſtration, yet by ſo certain proofes as the nature of the thing can ſuffer or require; for, bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſes of this nature take probable Arguments for demonſtration, as we are taught by the Doctors of of the Politicks.</p>
            <p>I know ſome have ſuffered for their free expreſſion of theſe things, yet, I am confident, it had been greater wiſdom (under favour) to let go free ſpeeches, rather then to examine them too neerly, namely, when they proceed, without malice or ſcurrility, from honeſt men, who in their zeal, perhaps, now and then, may exceed the exact terms of moderation; and this I am perſwaded, hath been the conſtant practice of wiſe men, grounded upon this: if the diſcourſe be groundleſſe, it fals of it ſelf. If there be any ground by ſtirring and ripping up ſpeeches, things will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear openly, which otherwayes in a ſhort time, would have been buried in oblivion.</p>
            <p>I forbear inſtances as in all my diſcourſe, keeping my ſelf to generalls, although I could have furniſhed divers examples upon every point I have touched; for, albeit it be ſaid, He that ſpeaks in generall of all and to all, ſpeak of none and to none, yet every one may make uſe of what is ſaid in generall, and apply it unto himſelf, for the good of the publike and of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:56773:60"/>
which I wiſh every one that reads this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, may do in all ſingleneſſe of heart, as it is ſet forth by him in ſincerity, who hath no other end in it, beſides the glory of God, the good of Church and State, and the true advantage of every honeſt man, without any wrong-meaning, but an earneſt deſire that every one who is right and honeſt in this Cauſe, without by-reſpects, may continue ſo till the end; and that thoſe who have gone a wrong way may return into the true, to the glory of God, the advancement of his Cauſe and of his people, with their own praiſe and benefit.</p>
            <p>Before I conclude, I will ſay this in truth, There was never a People in any age, who, by Gods bleſſing, did carry on the work of Reformation with more wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and reſolution, and ſucceſſe, then the <hi>Scots</hi> did in their own Countrey, and no more compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate of their Neighbours in diſtreſſe, nor more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to help them by action and counſell, and to carry on the work of Reformation amongſt them, then the <hi>Scots</hi> have been and are to this hour: So, there was never a People ſo harſhly uſed in divers kindes, by ſome of thoſe for whoſe good they have been and are ſo earneſt: If this coarſe uſage went no further then their own perſons, means, and reputation, they could paſſe it with ſilence, and not ſo much as think of it, laying it aſide in Chriſtian charity and brotherly love, although they ſuffer much in all theſe by it, ſince they have joyned with their Neighbours to help them: But, ſince, by the neglecting, oppoſing, and in a word ill-dealing with the <hi>Scots,</hi> the Service and work they are about is wronged, ſtopped, and delayed, which is mainly and namely to help the ſetting forward the Reformation of the Church of God, as it is expreſſed in the Nationall Covenant; they cannot but take it heavily to heart for the Name of Gods ſake. Surely
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:56773:61"/>
thoſe factions ones, who have uſed, and, at this time, uſe thus their Brethren, who have ventured, yea, loſt themſelves in a manner, with all what is dear unto men, for their ſake, and to do them 2 double good, that is, to help them out of trouble, and to ſettle 3 true and through Reformation amongſt them; have much to anſwer, not onely for their malice, unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, and ingratitude to thoſe who have ſpent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for them; but alſo, for their ſtopping and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, ſo far as in them lieth, the good work of God, and by that means give occaſion of the continuance of theſe miſeries wherein we are all now involved, and almoſt overwhelmed. God forgive theſe men, and turn them truely unto him, if it be his will; otherwiſe let them have no power to hinder his good Cauſe.</p>
            <p>And thus, good Reader, I have thought fit to give a little touch of divers main paſſages of theſe our troubleſome buſineſſes, leaving a fuller Diſcourſe of things to another time and another place.</p>
