            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

conſidering that neither your dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

can moue you to accord vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

that <hi>God</hi> hath left you to beleeue

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:18973:5"/>
that <hi>God</hi> of his goodnes will at laſt
pull you as a brand out of the fire,
and quench you with the dew of
his grace, that you may grow in
the knowledge of his <hi>Sonne;</hi> I wil
as briefly as I can, lay down ſome
few reaſons of that faith, which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
one that will be ſaued muſt
hold. Whereby if I perſwade you

much; that you, who neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued

confeſſe, that his word and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are <hi>holy and true.</hi> But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I come to the point, let mee
firſt perſwade you, that although
the knowledge of the holy <hi>Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
be one of the moſt high my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries
which can be knowne or
beleeued, and that it is the onely
work of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>holy Ghoſt</hi> to work this

of man, yet neuertheles, <hi>God</hi> hath

not left vs deſtitute of meanes,
whereby to come to this faith and
knowledge; but hath alſo with his
word, giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs a reaſonable ſoule &amp;
vnderſtanding, whereby to grow
in the knowledge of himſelf &amp; his
will. For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Adam</hi> was created,
he had giuen vnto him all perfite
knowledge meete for him. Now
<hi>God,</hi> who created the world for no
other purpoſe, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his owne glory, might not
leaue that creature without vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
of the <hi>Godhead,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by nature &amp; creatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the moſt
excellent in this world, was made
for that purpoſe eſpecially aboue
al other, to ſet forth his prayſe and
to call on him. Now how could he
do this, if he knew him not? But (I
think that) ſeeing it is ſaid, that <hi>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
was created in the Image of God,</hi> you
wil not deny y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> man before his fal,
had much more perfit vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Godhead,</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is poſsible
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:18973:6"/>
for him to haue, <hi>till he come to
know euen as he is knowen,</hi> but that
by him (you may ſay) this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
was loſt: not loſt, but cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
onely, euen as mans will.
For then it ſhould follow that wee
were inferiour to bruit beaſts, who
haue in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a ſenſible knowledge
meete for that ende whereto they
were created. Furthermore, it is
not poſsible that mans ſin ſhould
fruſtrate the ende which <hi>God</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
in his creation, but it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt,
that man was created to
know and honour the creator. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
ſeeing <hi>in Chriſt al things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt,</hi>
hee being ordained of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
before all worldes, in whom
the world ſhould be both created
and reſtored; it is plaine that this
light of our vnderſtanding both
proceedeth from him, and is reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in him, as it is ſaid, Ioh. 1. <hi>He is
that light which lightneth euery man

that commeth into the world,</hi> not
onely his choſen with knowledge
of his ſauing trueth, but euen ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
euery man with reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
vnderſtanding, whereby wee
may know <hi>whatſoeuer is to be known
of God:</hi> &amp; how? euen by the works
of <hi>God,</hi> as it is plainely concluded,
<hi>Rom. 1. 19, 20.</hi> Therefore are they
not to bee heard, who hold any
thing without the compaſſe of
<hi>Faith,</hi> which is without the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe
of <hi>Knowledge.</hi> For Faith ought
ſo to be grounded on Knowledge,
as <hi>Hope</hi> is grounded vpon Faith. So
that as Faith, <hi>Heb. 11. 1.</hi> is ſayd to
be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>an euiction or proofe of
things hoped for, though they bee not
ſeene<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> ſo may I ſay that Knowledge
is the proofe of things which are
beleeued. For Faith is nothing els
but the Concluſion of a particular
Syllogiſme, drawen from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
of an vniuerſall, which the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:18973:7"/>
knowledge of <hi>God</hi> had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded,
as it is manifeſt, <hi>Iam. 2. 19.</hi> &amp; <hi>Heb.
11. 3.</hi> By conference of which
two places it appeareth, that this
knowledge, of which I ſpeake, this
Hiſtoricall Faith, as to beleeue
that there is one <hi>God</hi> which made
all things of nought, is onely ſuch
a knowledge, as the deuils &amp; wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
men haue: but to beleeue, and
haue confidence in this <hi>God,</hi> is that
particular concluſion, &amp; that faith
which cauſeth vs to haue hope in
his promiſes. Therefore ſaid <hi>Chriſt,
Haue fayth in God:</hi> that is, ſtriue to
know <hi>God,</hi> that knowing, you may
haue faith, and beleeue in him.
And wee ſee that in theſe things,
where a bare faith without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
might ſeeme to be moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
becauſe as a man would
thinke, there were no reaſon to be
giuen of them, namely, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the maintenance of this life,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:18973:7"/>
and the reſurrection to the life to
come; both <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles
vſe no other reaſons, but ſuch as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
reaſonable man may eaſily
be perſwaded by, though authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Scripture were not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to both purpoſes, as it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt,
<hi>Mat. 6.</hi> and 1. <hi>Cor</hi> 15. yea <hi>Paul</hi>
at Athens, or whereſoeuer he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
the worſhip of the true
<hi>God</hi> among the Gentiles, hee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
not by authority of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which amongſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had bene
very weake; but by ſuch argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts
as they knew to be ſufficient eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues. If theſe things were not
ſo; how the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> could <hi>the Gentiles which
knew not the Scriptures, he without
excuſe</hi> for their ignorance of <hi>God?</hi>
Therefore I conclude, that there is
nothing which is beleeued, but it
may alſo be knowen. Now know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
(we know) is ingendred by
ſuch principles as haue truth in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:18973:8"/>
the which is euident of it ſelfe. So
that by plaine and reaſonable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
a man may knowe
whatſoeuer he beleeueth. You wil
ſay, To what purpoſe then ſerue
the Scriptures? I anſwere: That
<hi>God,</hi> infinite in goodneſſe, hath to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with this vnderſtanding
&amp; light of Nature, giuen vs withall
his word, as a greater light where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
our leſſer lights might become
more ſhining: That he hath giuen
vnto vs not only an inward word,
to wit, our natural vnderſtanding;
but alſo an outward worde, as a
moſt illuſtrious Comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tary, both
of declaration and amplification of
that text; whereby we may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
vnderſtand, whatſoeuer wee
ought to vnderſtand without it.
But how the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> commeth it to paſſe,
that all men haue not Faith? And
how is <hi>Faith</hi> ſayd to bee <hi>the gift of
God?</hi> The firſt is anſwered, Rom. 1
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:18973:8"/>
21. and Ephe. 4. 18 <hi>For hardnes of
their heart, who when they knew God,
did not glorifie him as they ought:
therefore their imaginations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> became
vaine, &amp; their fooliſh heart was ful of
darkenes.</hi> And for this cauſe is Faith
alſo ſayd to bee the gift of <hi>God.</hi>
Firſt, in reſpect of that knowledge
whence it doeth proceede, which
knowledge is his gift. Secondly,
becauſe it is the onely worke of
<hi>God,</hi> to make that knowledge to
become fruitful, by laying it ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
mans heart, that the hardneſſe
thereof may bee remoued, that
when wee know <hi>God</hi> to bee good
and iuſt, we alſo beleeue and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
him as we ought. Thirdly and
moſt eſpecially, becauſe that <hi>God</hi>
oftentimes pardoning the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
which men haue of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
and the creature, doth ſo illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the heart with <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>holy Spirit,</hi>
that it is ſuddenly <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">

               </gap> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:18973:9"/>
any previant knowledge, to
faith and obedience. The trueth
whereof neuertheles doth not any
whit impugne that which I ſay,
<hi>That God hath giuen vnto euery man
ſo much vnderſtanding as to know
what he ought to beleeue, and to bee
ſatisfied for the reaſons of his Fayth,
if he could open his eyes to ſee in the
middeſt of what wonderous light hee
were placed.</hi> This point is manifeſt
both by many Scripture-authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and by many reaſons which I
omit. But taking this as either
granted, or ſufficiently prooued,
that <hi>God hath giuen vs light of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
whereby to yeeld a reaſon of
the Hope that is in vs;</hi> a reaſon I ſay
euen of euery article of our Faith:
let vs with holy reuerence come
vnto the thing in queſtion, and ſee
what reaſon wee haue for our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.
I will therefore a while for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare
to vſe the authoritie of holy
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:18973:9"/>
Scripture; not that I eſteeme the
waight or euidence of any reaſon
comparable thereto: but onely
perceiuing by that talke I had with
you, that you had read the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as one of thoſe whom <hi>Peter</hi>
noteth, 2. Epiſt. 3. 16. Not inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to wrangle about your wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
interpretations; I wil firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone
the euidence of reaſonable
proofe: and afterwards bring in
the aſſent of holy Scripture, that
you may perceiue in what won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous
cleare light you ſtriue to be
blinde. And becauſe I know not
what your opinion is concerning
<hi>God,</hi> (for he that denieth the <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
of Chriſt,</hi> may as well denie the
<hi>Godhead</hi> abſolutely:) that beeing
one ſteppe toward the queſtion, I
will proceed orderly, and giue you
alſo a reaſon of our faith, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
that matter: taking this one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as granted, which is rife in euery
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:18973:10"/>
mans knowledge, that both the
termes of Contradiction, cannot
bee affirmed of the ſame Subiect:
that is, that one and the ſame thing
cannot be both affirmed and deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
of the ſame Subiect, at one time,
and in the ſame reſpect.</p>
            <p>But firſt, by the Name of <hi>God,</hi>
know that I meane an <hi>Eternall Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
infinite in goodneſſe, in power, in
wiſedome, in glory, in vertue, and one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
worthie of endleſſe loue and honour.</hi>
My reaſon is thus. If there be not
a Being which had no beginning,
then of neceſsitie, that which was
firſt exiſtent or begunne, muſt be a
beginning vnto it ſelfe, by cauſing
of it ſelfe to be, when it was not.
But this is impoſsible, that any
thing ſhould bee a cauſe, and not
bee: for ſo ſhould it both bee and
not be; therefore there is an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Being, which is the beginning,
middle and ende of all things, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:18973:10"/>
himſelfe without beginning, and
this eternall Beeing wee call <hi>God.</hi>
My reaſon is plaine to bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood;
and remember what I haue
ſaid, that I may goe on.</p>
            <p>Whatſoeuer is without begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
is alſo without ending; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it hath no Superiour which
might bring it to nothing: therefore
<hi>God is eternall.</hi> Againe, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
comes to nothing, is corrupted
by his contrary; but nothing can
be oppoſite to <hi>God,</hi> therefore hee is
Eternall. Or elſe I might thus
reaſon.</p>
            <p>Being and Not Being are ſuch
contraries, as one of them cannot
ſpring out of another: for euery
thing, for the preſeruations ſake of
it ſelfe, doth repreſſe and corrupt
the contrary. Seing then that there
is Beeing, which could not poſsibly
raiſe it ſelfe out of Not Being, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
that Being had a primacy or
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:18973:11"/>
prioritie before Not Beeing: and
therefore of neceſsitie muſt be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall;
for otherwiſe there was a
time, wherein it might be ſaid, that
Being is Not Being, &amp; ſo Not Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſhould haue been firſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictories
might haue ſtood to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether:
but both theſe are impoſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
therefore there is an eternall
Being; and this eternall Being,
wee call God. Furthermore wee
know, that the greateſt excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
or perfection of euery thing, is
in the proximitie or approch there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
vnto the firſt cauſe. But euery
thing is more excellent in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereof, then in the Not Being:
therefore Beeing was before Not
Being; and for that cauſe Eternall.
Now Eternitie is an Infinite Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance:
therefore whatſoeuer is E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall,
muſt of neceſsitie be Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite:
and this Infinite Being, we call
<hi>God.</hi> Moreouer, whatſoeuer hath
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:18973:11"/>
Infinite continuance, hath Infinite
Power to continue infinitely; and
this omnipotent or endleſſe Power
we call <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might reaſon likewiſe of his
<hi>Goodnes,</hi> of his <hi>Wiſedome, Trueth,
Glory, &amp;c.</hi> but one ſhall ſerue in
ſtead of the reſt, and I will take his
Wiſedome for my example, and
proue vnto you, that likewiſe to be
Infinite, and that not onely in exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence,
but in action alſo. And
firſt that hee is wiſe; <hi>God</hi> is moſt
worthy to be ſuch as he is: but if he
were not wiſe, he were not worthy
to bee <hi>God: ergo</hi> hee is wiſe. Now
marke how theſe depende one on
another. In <hi>God</hi> is Wiſedome,
which by reaſon of his Infinitie, is
alſo infinite: and by his Eternitie, is
alſo eternal: ſo that there is no time,
wherein it may be ſaid, that this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Wiſdom is not infinitely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed,
for then were it not eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:18973:12"/>
infinite. Therefore his wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
is infinite, not in exiſtence
onely, but alſo in action.</p>
            <p>Againe, the wiſedome of <hi>God</hi>
is ſuch, as hath no defect or imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cillitie
therein. But if it were not
Infinite both in action and in exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence,
a man might find defect
therein, and imagine a more Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
wiſedome then that is, but
this is impoſsible. So might I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
of all the other Dignities of
<hi>God,</hi> but I haſte to the purpoſe, and
I thinke that you will not vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
graunt what I haue ſaid, but
vnderſtand the reſt. All the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
of <hi>God</hi> beeing actuated or
brought into working, require of
neceſsitie an Infinite Obiect,
whereon they worke, becauſe they
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues are Infinite: but nothing
can be Infinite, but <hi>God</hi> alone, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it followeth that theſe Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
are obiected or exerciſed in
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:18973:12"/>
               <hi>God</hi> alone. And this is that Eternal
Sonne, begotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before the worlds,
in whome the <hi>Father reſteth:</hi> or as
the Prophet ſpeaketh, <hi>His beloued,
in whome his ſoule delighteth;</hi> which
cannot be applyed to any creature,
without which, <hi>God</hi> is happy in him
ſelfe: therefore ſaith the Apoſtle,
that <hi>in him dwelleth the Godhead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily.</hi>
How is that? not in his manly
body eternally; for his humane bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
tooke beginning of the fleſh of
the Virgin, when the fulnes of time
came, but yet bodily, that is, as eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially,
or ſubſtantially, as the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of a man is ſubſtantiall to the
man. For euery Dignity of <hi>God</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
infinite in action (as was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued)
muſt of neceſsitie produce
ſuch as it ſelfe is. As for example;
the Wiſdome of <hi>God</hi> or his Infinite
Vnderſtanding, muſt haue an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
intelligible or vnderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
obiect, which is produced
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:18973:13"/>
thereby, by an infinite vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.
So that ye muſt know of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsitie,
and marke three Termes,
as I will a while call them: the
Terme from whence: the Terme
whereto, or wherein: and the
middle Terme betweene them. I
will for your capacitie, which I
know not to bee much exerciſed in
theſe matters, make a compariſon
meet for your vnderſtanding.</p>
            <p>When the minde or vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of a man conceiueth any vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandable
obiect, then is (you
know) firſt the vnderſtanding in
the minde it ſelfe, ſecondly the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
vnderſtood, and thirdly, the
diſcourſe or vnderſtanding, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
that obiect is apprehended.</p>
            <p>Now giue me leaue to tell you,
what differences you muſt make,
betweene the vnderſtanding of
<hi>God,</hi> and the vnderſtanding of
man in this compariſon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:18973:13"/>
Firſt, the minde of man beeing
finite, the vnderſtanding is not able
to view al that which can be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
thereby at one time, or with
one action of vnderſtanding, but
muſt conceiue of one thing after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother:
whereas the vnderſtanding
and wiſedome of <hi>God</hi> is ſuch, as at
one ſight ſeeth himſelfe, and euery
thing els, paſt, preſent, and to come;
and this not once onely, but euen
continually, becauſe it is eternally
infinite.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the intendement of
man worketh nothing in the thing
conceiued, to make it either to be,
if it be a meere conceit, or to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then it is, if it be exiſtent: but
the vnderſtanding of God, is by
reaſon of his power ſo actiue, as that
it cauſeth that wherein it is exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
both to be, and that according
to his maner of apprehenſion or
vnderſtanding of it: which vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:18973:14"/>
is by his Infinitie ſo infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,
and by his Eternitie ſo conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall,
as that of neceſsitie there
muſt bee a ſubſiſtence or a perſon,
wherein it muſt be exerciſed, which
muſt alſo be Infinite and Eternall.
And this is that glorious <hi>Sonne</hi> of
<hi>God,</hi> who is thus begotten or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
eternally, both before the
world was, euen as hee is now, and
ſhall not ceaſe to be produced after
the world ſhall ceaſe eternally.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee two of the termes
ſpoken of: from whence, &amp; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in:
now you muſt know the middle
terme betweene them. The terme
whence, is the Wiſedome intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
<hi>God the Father.</hi> The terme
wherein, is the Wiſedome intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible,
<hi>God the Sonne.</hi> The middle
terme is, <hi>ipſum intelligere,</hi> which in
my Compariſon I called, The <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comſe
it ſelfe,</hi> which alſo in this muſt
needs bee Infinite. For an Infinite
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:18973:14"/>
intelligible, cannot bee conceiued
of an Infinite intelligent, but by an
Infinite <hi>intelligere;</hi> and this is that
<hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> which as you may eaſily
vnderſtand, muſt of neceſsitie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
from both the <hi>Father</hi> and the
<hi>Sonne,</hi> and be alſo infinite and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
and therefore <hi>God.</hi> Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are all Infinite, and of
Infinite, eſſentially there can
bee but one: therefore are theſe
three in <hi>Eſſence</hi> or <hi>Being,</hi> one, but in
<hi>Subſiſtence</hi> or cleare diſtinction of
<hi>Perſons,</hi> three.</p>
            <p>Vnderſtande my compariſon
which I made: I will yet cleare the
matter further for your concey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing.</p>
            <p>If you take in a myrrour, the
light of the Sunne, and reflect it
directly thereon againe, in the
Sunne it is one, in the glaſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
and yet the reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the beames, is alſo a
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:18973:15"/>
third, but for all this, there is but
one nature and worde of light,
which comprehends al three: ſo is it
in this <hi>Tri-Vnitie</hi> of which I ſpeake.
My leiſure ſerues me not to dilate
theſe things, but I hope you are
able to vnderſtand what I ſay,
therefore I will proceed. It is ſaid,
that Powers are knowne by their
actions, and actions are limitted by
their obiects. I know the meaning
of it, and it is not vnfitte in this
place. But to my reaſon: The Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of <hi>God</hi> is infinite, and by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
wiſedome hee knoweth it to
be infinite: but <hi>God</hi> could not know
that his Power were infinite, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
he were able thereby to bring
forth an infinite action; and euery
infinite action muſt of neceſsitie be
exerciſed in an infinite ſubiect.
(For whatſoeuer is receiued, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
according to the capacitie of
the receiuer:) therefore there is an
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:18973:15"/>
infinite ſubiect, wherein the power
of <hi>God</hi> is exerciſed: that is the
<hi>Sonne</hi> of whom I ſpeake. And here
againe behold the <hi>Tri-Vnitie;</hi> an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
<hi>power</hi> the <hi>Father;</hi> an infinite
<hi>action</hi> the <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi> an infinite <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect</hi>
the <hi>glorious Sonne;</hi> all three one
infinite <hi>Being.</hi> Returne to your
compariſon.</p>
            <p>As the vnderſtanding of man
could no way know his owne po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
but by his actions, neither can
there be any actions of vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
where there is nothing to be
vnderſtood, no more is it poſsible
to bee in the Deitie. Now vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
that, as I haue reaſoned from
the <hi>Wiſedome</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God:</hi> ſo
might I reaſon from all his other
Dignities: ſo that for one reaſon
which I haue brought. I might
haue brought you fiftie. But I ſhew
you the way, if you be guided by
the <hi>Spirit of Trueth,</hi> how you may
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:18973:16"/>
ſtrengthen your ſelfe in the way
of Trueth: therefore I wil goe on,
and ſhew you yet more plainely by
more familiar reaſons.</p>
            <p>An Infinite power is not more
weake then a finite: but euery fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
creature which we can caſt our
eies vnto, doth by nature produce
his like, as much as in it is; as a man
begetteth a man; trees bring forth
ſeed, whereof their like in nature
may ſpring, and in likewiſe euery
other thing. Therefore the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Power of <hi>God</hi> begetteth his
like alſo, which is the <hi>Sonne, the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of the inuiſible God, the firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
of euery creature,</hi> Col. 1. 15.
But none can bee like vnto <hi>God</hi> in
his Being, who is not very <hi>God:</hi>
therefore <hi>Chriſt the onely begotten of
the Father</hi> is alſo very <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Maruel not, that I make this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
from the creature to the
Creator; for in this very point of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:18973:16"/>
the <hi>Power &amp; Godhead,</hi> the <hi>Holy ghoſt</hi>
himſelfe teacheth me to reaſon of
<hi>the inuiſible things of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the things
viſible,</hi> Rom. 1. 20. And hereby al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
learne to helpe your ignorance,
and put away your wonder, how
<hi>God</hi> ſhould bee one, and yet three.
See you not how the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding?
the Sun-light alſo, is one in
nature, and yet three in euident
and cleare diſtinction? though in ſo
baſe and imperfect order, as that
which is aboue all perfection, is
poſsible to be aboue it.</p>
            <p>And further, ſee you not in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
thing a bodie, a ſpirite and a
life, which is the knot betweene
them?</p>
            <p>Or rather, ſee you not how the
very bodily compoſition is both
one, and three? one body which is
vnited of three bodies? that is,
earth, water, and ayre, or oyle,
which yet again in the root of their
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:18973:17"/>
nature are but one. For oyle is but
a due mixture of water and earth,
meanely fixt, and meanely volatil;
and earth is but fixed water; ſo that
water which is but one, is the root
of the three: as it is manifeſt,
Geneſis 1. and 2. Pet. 3. 5. They
which vnderſtand the rules of Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronomy,
know what I ſay; and if
you vnderſtand me wel, you would
confeſſe, that not onely this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
which I haue brought, of
earth, water and ayre; but euen the
whole frame of Nature did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime
the <hi>Trinitie</hi> in the <hi>Vnitie.</hi> You
would, I ſay, confeſſe, that whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
may be knowne of <hi>God,</hi> is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted
in the creature. If I ſhould
here tell you, how the <hi>Heauen,</hi> the
<hi>Earth,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Deepe,</hi> Gen. 1. might
be vnderſtood myſtically, and the
Analogie betweene the <hi>Creator</hi> and
the <hi>creature</hi> therein: and then tell
you, what <hi>Let the earth bring forth
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:18973:17"/>
liuing ſoule,</hi> might meane, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
it with that place, <hi>That which

to proue the <hi>Tri-Vnitie,</hi> by
that treble repetition of the <hi>man
made in the image of God;</hi> compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
it with that place, 1. Cor. 11. 3.
and 7. If I ſhould then tell you,
that it was neceſſarie that the <hi>Sonne
of God</hi> muſt become fleſh, as well
that the <hi>infinite Iuſtice of God</hi> might
be actuated in him, which could not
bee actuated in him beeing onely
GOD: as for many other reaſons,
both from the Iuſtice, and Mercie,
and Wiſedome of GOD, though
to a well ſighted vnderſtanding I
might ſeeme to haue layd a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
foundation of Philoſophie di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:18973:18"/>
and natural: yet to you I might
rather ſeeme perhaps to haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned
Cabaliſticall dreames, then
any ſound argument to the thing in
queſtion.</p>
            <p>Yet this will I tell you, and
holde it for good Diuinitie: that
the mayne drift and ſcope of the
whole Scripture, is to ſhew the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of all things in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> through
him and for him: and the reſtoring
of the whole creature in man <hi>by him:
That in al things he might haue the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence,</hi>
Col. 1. Neyther doth this
any whit derogate from the honour
of the Father.</p>
            <p>For firſt, <hi>It hath pleaſed the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

to be the <hi>Father</hi> of ſo glorious a

            </p>
            <p>Therefore is this world and all the
things therein, created to the Image
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:18973:18"/>
of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to expreſſe his glory, <hi>euen
as he is the expreſſed Image and glory of
the Father.</hi> And here is the worlds
Eternitie, which had in Chriſt an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
Being; according to that

            <p>Here are thoſe ſeparate Ideas,
about which <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>
could neuer agree, and which ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
both of them, nor many of
their followers did perfectly vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand:
not that they might not by
the frame of nature, and the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
which GOD had giuen to
man, be vnderſtood.</p>
            <p>For is not this world as a booke
wherein wee may reade and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
by the created trueths, what is
the <hi>Trueth</hi> which is increated? but
all true knowledge is the gift of
GOD.</p>
            <p>Therefore wreſt not that place,
Coloſſ. 2. 8. againſt the Chriſtian
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:18973:19"/>
ſearch after the knowledge of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
whereby aboue all other hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
knowledges a man is brought
to know GOD, and to honour
him as he ought: but rather be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
that your knowledge of Nature
is no more. For that will I tell you,
to teach you to know your ſelfe,
that there is nothing in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which may be knowne, (and
all may bee knowne that is in the
creature) but man ought to know
it, and to glorifie the <hi>Creator</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.
<hi>And this great labour hath GOD
giuen to men,</hi> that knowing how
ſhort they are of that they ought
to be, <hi>they might bee humbled there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,</hi>
Pſal. 1. 11. Eccles. 1. 13. And
why ought this to ſeeme ſtrange?
doth not <hi>God</hi> require that perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
at mans hand wherein he did create
him? and was he not created with
perfect diſcourſe to know the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that hee might therein behold
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:18973:19"/>
the <hi>Creator,</hi> and ſo glorifie his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous
<hi>Power</hi> and <hi>goodneſſe?</hi> But this
queſtion would draw mee from the
queſtion in hand: &amp; therefore I wil
briefly adde one reaſon more: and
becauſe my leiſure is little, I will be
as ſhort as I can: but I pray you lend
mee your eare; for it is hard in
Engliſh, an inartificiall language,
to expreſſe my mind: but becauſe
you told me, you could a little La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,
I will be bold here and there,
to vſe a word: my reaſon is thus.
The whole and perfect nature of a
Principle or Beginning is in <hi>God,</hi>
who is alone the beginner of all
things. Now a Principle is of three
ſortes, whereof euery one is ſo
clearely diſtinct from another, as
that one cannot poſsibly be that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
therefore in the <hi>Vnitie</hi> of the
<hi>Deitie</hi> there is alſo ſuch cleare di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
into a <hi>Trinitie,</hi> as that one
diſtinct cannot poſsibly be that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:18973:20"/>
from which hee is diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,
yet in the <hi>Vnitie</hi> of eſſence they
are all one. The differences of a
Beginning ſtand thus; It is either
<hi>Principium principians, non principia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum;</hi>
that is, a beginning, which is
a Beginner vnto another; yet hath
not his beginning from another,
leſt there ſhould be a proceſſe into
Infinitie <hi>a parte ante:</hi> this is <hi>God the
Father,</hi> to whom it is peculiar to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
the <hi>Sonne,</hi> yet is himſelfe ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
made<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor created, nor begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
of any other.</p>
            <p>Secondly, there is <hi>Principium
principiatum principians;</hi> to witte,
a Beginning which hath his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of another, and is alſo a
beginning to another, leſt there
ſhould be any defect or imbecilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
in the Beginning: and this is the
<hi>Euerlaſting Sonne,</hi> very <hi>God</hi> of very
<hi>God,</hi> begotten of the ſubſtance of
his <hi>Father</hi> alone before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> worlds,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:18973:20"/>
neither made nor created.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, there is <hi>Principium prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipiatum
non principians;</hi> that is, a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
which is alſo begun, but
is not a beginner vnto another: leſt
there ſhould be a proceſſe into In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitie
<hi>a parte poſt:</hi> and this is the
<hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> who proceedeth from
the very ſubſtance and Being of the
<hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Sonne,</hi> and is with
them one GOD coeternall and
coequall. But you will ſay, Is not
the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> a Beginner vnto any
other? how is he then the Authour
of our conſolation? and how is hee
ſaid to <hi>leade vs into all trueth, &amp;c?</hi>
Vnderſtand what I meane: Hee is
not a Beginner vnto any other of
the ſame Infinite Eſſence or Being
with himſelfe. For the beginnings
which I ſpake of before, are in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of <hi>God</hi> alone now our ſpiritual
conſolation, whereof the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi>
is ſaid to be the Beginner, is but an
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:18973:21"/>
or effluence from that
Being, which he himſelfe is; as the
light of the Sunne doth illuminate
euery bright body expoſed to his
light, and yet imparteth not his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereto. You will againe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect,
that Eternitie hath no begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
nor ending: how then can
<hi>Chriſt</hi> be both eternall and begun?
and how againe can he be equall to
the <hi>Father,</hi> whereas hee beeing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
of the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Father</hi> hath
a prioritie before him? I anſwere,
that this beginning is none other,
then that production or begetting,
which I before declared, to haue
been heretofore none other, then
it is now and ſhall be eternally: as
the Sunne hath brought forth light
ſince his creation, and ſhall ſtill
bring forth light till the worlds diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution.
For this action of GOD,
whereby hee begetteth his <hi>Sonne,</hi> is
not a tranſeant action, to cauſe a
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:18973:21"/>
paſsion in the ſubiect, and a repaſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the agent, for in ſuch the
ſubiect of neceſsitie ſhould haue
been exiſtent before the action; but
this action is immanent, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of neceſsitie of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
with the agent; which agent
becauſe it is eternall, therefore the
production is alſo eternal, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
the product, and ſo of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsitie
very GOD. But you muſt
euer remember what difference I
made betweene the action of <hi>God,</hi>
infinite in power, &amp; therefore able
to actuate the obiect; and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent
actions of our minde. Now
for the Prioritie or Poſterioritie,
you may obiect. I graunt there is
Prioritie among the perſons of the
<hi>Godhead;</hi> but of what kinde? not
of Being; for their Eſſence is one,
and therein is none afore or after
another, neither is any one of the
<hi>Trinitie</hi> more or leſſe God then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other:
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:18973:22"/>
not of time; for they are all
one Eternitie: not of dignitie, for
they are all one Infinitie: and the
<hi>Sonne</hi> himſelfe <hi>being very God, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
it no robberie to bee equall with
God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But yet there is Prioritie, and that
of order onely; for the <hi>Father</hi> is in
order before the <hi>Sonne,</hi> becauſe the
<hi>Sonne</hi> is begotten of the <hi>Father:</hi> and
the <hi>Sonne</hi> likewiſe is before the <hi>Holy
Ghoſt,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> is the
mutuall loue betweene the <hi>Father</hi>
and the <hi>Sonne:</hi> and ſo proceeding
from them both.</p>
            <p>I will make a compariſon vnmeet
for the matter of which I ſpeake; for
to whom ſhall wee aſsimulate the
<hi>Higheſt?</hi> but yet meete to helpe your
vnderſtanding. When a man doth
dreame and imagine things which
are not, there is, you know, the phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie,
the phantaſme or thing imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
or dreamed, and the phanſying
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:18973:22"/>
or working of the phantaſie about
that obiect. Now theſe three are all
of one nature, and are one after an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
onely in order, and not in
time.</p>
            <p>For the particular phantaſie
of ſuch an obiect, is before the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect,
and makes it to haue an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall
being; then the obiect being,
the diſcourſe of the phantaſie follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in order, which neuertheleſſe was
in time as ſoone as it, obſeruing euer
the cautions that are to bee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued.</p>
            <p>Thus haue I very briefly ſhowne
not many reaſons, but rather how
that many reaſons may bee ſhowen
for this Chriſtian aſſertion: yet haue
I ſhowen ynough to perſwade any
reaſonable man, to yeelde meekely
vnto the trueth of that doctrine,
which is ſo euident both in the
booke of GOD, and in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
faithfull and true Chriſtian mans
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:18973:23"/>
confeſsion, and according to that
diſcourſe which is euident to euery
mans vnderſtanding. Now giue me
leaue to ſpeake a little to thoſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
which haue throwen the
moſt learned of the Iewes head-long
to the feet of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to make
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> acknowledge that the <hi>Meſsiab
muſt be both God and man.</hi> I will not
herein doe any thing contrary to
that, which in the beginning I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted,
that is, not to compel you by
authoritie of Scripture, but to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate
you by reaſonable perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to encline your eare to the
trueth. But becauſe I may not
without iniurie to the cauſe, leaue
altogether out ſuch manifeſt
proofe, and without iniurie alſo to
your ſelfe, who might thinke that
I went about to ſophiſticate a true
ſeeming vntrueth, which would not
abide the touch: I will onely intend
my finger to ſome very few, of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:18973:23"/>
thouſandes of axiomes of the
Scripture for this purpoſe, &amp; leaue
you to make the concluſion by your
ſelfe, hoping that the Iewes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
may prouoke you to follow
them, ſo farre forth as they haue fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the trueth. Exod. 13. 21, it
is ſaid, <hi>The Lord went before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp;c.</hi>
Chap. 14. 19. <hi>The Angel of God,

Againe, Exod. 15. 3. <hi>The Lorde is a
man of warre, his name is Iehouah:</hi>
therefore <hi>Chriſt is God and man:</hi>
who by his conflict vpon the croſſe,
triumphed ouer Death and Hell, as
it is written in the Goſpell, <hi>the booke

put together, according to the rules
of that excellent Grammar of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie,
with reference to that which
followes, may import thus much.
The <hi>Word,</hi> the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and the <hi>Father,</hi>

calls it, <hi>the inacceſsible light of the

a great myſterie that the <hi>Son</hi> is here
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:18973:25"/>
put in the firſt place: for <hi>In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
was the word:</hi> becauſe the
chiefe honour both of the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and reſtauration of the world is
giuen vnto Chriſt, as the Apoſtle
doth comment vpon this text, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſ.
1. And in another place, <hi>In him
is all the treaſure both of the wiſedome
and knowledge of God.</hi> As Pſal. 104.
verſ. 24. <hi>In wiſedome haſt thou made
them all.</hi> For in <hi>Chriſt</hi> were al things
together one infinite wiſedome, till
in the Creation he made them ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
according to their diſtinct
Ideas. Therefore ſaith the Apoſtle,
<hi>He ſuſtayneth euery thing by his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull
word:</hi> that is, the <hi>Sonne:</hi> and
elſewhere, <hi>In him</hi> (Chriſt) <hi>wee liue
and moue</hi> (after the Creation) <hi>and
haue our Being</hi> (before the Creation.)
And for this cauſe doth <hi>Iohn</hi> begin
the law of mercie and grace, in the

of iuſtice, nor of mercie, &amp;c. but
onely by <hi>Chriſt;</hi> as he ſaith, <hi>No man
knoweth the Father, but the Son, and
he to whom the Sonne wil reueile him.</hi>
And in another place, <hi>No man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to the Father, but by me.</hi> Now,
the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> is put in the ſecond
place, becauſe hee is the mutuall
loue of the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Sonne,</hi>
and as I may ſay, the inſtrument of
their actions, both in manent, and

and our <hi>feare:</hi> yet our <hi>ioy</hi> and <hi>bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:
all in all: The preſence of God.</hi> I
may not ſay what experience hath
taught mee, by this magnificent
and admirable Name; neyther am
I able to giue due honour thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.
My thoughts are ſwallowed vp,
when I conſider the other great
myſteries which this one letter
doth import: the myſterie of the
triple world; the myſterie of mercy
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:18973:34"/>
and of Iuſtice; of Election, and
Reprobation; of that great <hi>Iubile,</hi>
or <hi>Sabbath of Sabbaths,</hi> when that
which is aboue, ſhal again deſcend,
to reſtore the creature from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
and change, into that nimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie
or exceſſe of Goodnes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it was created. But theſe things
are therefore here to bee omitted,
becauſe the diſcourſe thereof were
long, and becauſe they are rather
conſequents, then premiſes to the
queſtion. To tell you at once, &amp; to
make an end of this argument: The
whole Nation of the learned Iewes
confeſſe, that the <hi>Meſsiha</hi> ſhould
bee called by this great Name:
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. To which purpoſe, there
are, beſides theſe which haue been
brought, many places of Scripture,
which in the Hebrue veritie are
moſt direct, though by our tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
they might ſeeme ſomewhat
harſh. They hold, I ſay, that Hee
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:18973:34"/>
muſt be both <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man:</hi> and in
a word, there is nothing which wee
Chriſtians doe affirme concerning
our <hi>Lord,</hi> but the euidence of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
doth compell them to confeſſe
it. Onely they differ in this, from
vs; whether <hi>This Ieſus be that Chriſt
that ſhould come into the worlde;</hi>
though this alſo be a thing not que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable,
as you may learne of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel
9. verſ. 24. 25. 26. &amp; 2. Eſd. 7.
verſ. 28. 29.</p>
            <p>Although the common errour
and expectation of the Iewes, was
of a terreſtriall Monarchy; yet the
beſt learned of them agree, that
<hi>the Kingdome of Chriſt is not of this
world.</hi> For they remember that
place in the Teſtament of <hi>Iacob:
The Scepter ſhal not depart from Iuda,
till Shiloh come.</hi> By which it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes,
that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Meſsiha</hi> ſhal come,
there ſhould bee no more ſhew
of an earthly kingdome. That of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:18973:35"/>
Zach. 9. 9. is as direct, <hi>Ieruſalem, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
thy king commeth vnto thee poore.</hi>
They remember alſo that in the
21. Pſalme, <hi>I am a worme and no
man, a ſhame of men and the contempt
of the people.</hi> And that alſo of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay.
53. <hi>Hee hath neyther forme nor
beautie: when we ſee him, there ſhall
be no forme that we should deſire him.
He is deſpiſed &amp; reiected of men, &amp;c.</hi>
Reade the whole Chapter and the
Pſalme, compare them with the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories
of his Paſsion, and behold
<hi>Him</hi> on the Croſſe, in the horror of
his anguiſh, &amp; extreme perplexitie.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay, what is this Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daiſme
in the letters of his Name,
for argument to proue that hee is
<hi>God?</hi> Is it more then if wee ſhould
write the name of <hi>Chriſt</hi> with the
laſt letter thereof capitall, <hi>Chris</hi> T;
becauſe it may repreſent the croſſe?
or els the two laſt letters ſo enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laced,
that they may haue reference
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:18973:35"/>
to the ſerpent in the wildernes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that was alſo a figure of
CHRI<figure>
                  <figDesc>'S' superimposed on 'T'</figDesc>
               </figure>? Though I had here
to anſwere for the Cabala of euery
of the 72 languages of the Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
yet I ſay only thus: If after all
this that I haue ſaid, you will ſtill be
contentious, I haue no ſuch cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome,
but I am well content, that
either thus, or by any other means,
a Christian man ſhould hold that
in perpetuall memorie, which is his
Ioy, his Victorie, his Crowne, his
Happines in this world, and in the
world to come.</p>
            <p>Were it to any purpoſe to make
you know, what the ancient Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers,
who knew not the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
haue thought of this matter?
all ſpeaking this one thing, which
the light that GOD hath giuen to
mankind, did make them know, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they concealed their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment
by diuers names. Yet
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:18973:36"/>
               <hi>Hermes</hi> called him plainely the
<hi>Sonne</hi> of GOD. <hi>Zoroaſter,</hi> the <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
of his Father. Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras,
Wiſedome;</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Salomon,</hi>
euery where, and particularly, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerb.
8. and in the booke of that
title.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Parmenides</hi> named him <hi>The
Sphere of Vnderſtanding. Orpheus</hi>
termed him <hi>Pallas,</hi> to the ſame
effect as the other, if you know the
fable: and yet hee ſpeakes more
plainely to the <hi>Trinitie,</hi> in his
Hymnes of <hi>the Night,</hi> of <hi>the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,</hi>
and of <hi>the Ayre. Platoes ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Ideas</hi> meane nothing elſe: and
in fumme, as many of the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
as were worth any thing,
were not ignorant of this thing.
But I feare, theſe authorities are
with you of little worth: yet haue
I brought them, that you may ſee
how wee are furniſhed with all
kinde of proofes, and how you
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:18973:36"/>
doe contemne all maner of teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
            <p>If this which I haue ſaid, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
you to looke better to the
foundation of your faith, it is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient:
if it perſwade you nothing,
then haue I done contrary to the
Commandement, which forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
to caſt pearles before ſwine.
But yet I hope, that <hi>God</hi> will not
ſuffer you to bee ledde any longer
by that <hi>Spirit of Antichriſt,</hi> againſt
which S. <hi>Iohn</hi> doth ſo often warne
vs. For I doe you to witte, that this
your hereſie is no new thing, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
as ancient as the Apoſtles
time. For, the reaſon of <hi>Iohns</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of his Goſpell, was, to proue
the <hi>Godhead</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> againſt the
Heretikes that denied it in his
owne time. And truely, I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
that you, who haue receyued
this Hereſie from the rotten
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:18973:37"/>
bones of <hi>Arrius,</hi> ſhould not prouide
for your ſafetie as he did. He deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the authoritie of S. <hi>Iohns</hi> writings
to be authenticall. And why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
this earth-bred Gyant, which
would pul <hi>Christ,</hi> out of the throne
of his <hi>Deitie,</hi> ſhould with his ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening
be ſuddenly burnt. Beleeue
you the Scripture? Is <hi>Iohns</hi> authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
ſufficient? then the caſe is plaine.
<hi>We are in him that is true, in his Sonne
Ieſus Christ, who is very God, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
life.</hi> 1. Ioh. 5. 20. Can you
now confer this Scripture with that
place, <hi>I haue ſaid ye are Gods,</hi> and
not be aſhamed? <hi>I and the Father are
one.</hi> The Iewes vnderſtood, that
hee herein profeſſed himſelfe to be
very GOD: and are you his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
more then they? Read Ioh. 10.
verſ. 30. and 33. and 34. and you
may vnderſtand the meaning of
both places. The diuels acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
him to be GOD of Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:18973:37"/>
power: <hi>I know thee who thou art, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
that Holy one of God:</hi> And wil not
you co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe as much as the diuels? But
this is more then I thought to ſay, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
you may ſee hereby, that we ſpeake
no other thing then <hi>Christ</hi> himſelfe,
euen in his enemies vnderſtanding,
ſaid. Now if you could ſee a little the
folly of your owne opinion; that were
inough to cauſe you to put on a better
mind. I wil touch it as lightning doth
touch the ground: for if you be willing
to be reformed, there is no doubt, but
you may propound it to the learned
Diuines, and be fully ſatisfied. You
ſay <hi>Christ is onely man, but yet indued
with the infinite Power of GOD.</hi> Here
firſt you doe iniurie to the <hi>Higheſt,</hi> to
make the <hi>Power of God</hi> to bee acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall
vnto him: whereas hee is <hi>purus
actus,</hi> abſolute perfection, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſhadow of change: his Beeing is
moſt ſimple and pure, not capable of
accidents. Then his Being is ſuch, as
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:18973:38"/>
no addition can be made thereto, to
make it more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is: therfore it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
that he be euer actually what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
he may be. Beſides, His Being
is infinitely diſtant from Not Being;
therfore his Power is inſeparable. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
if there come any thing to <hi>God</hi> as
an accident, it muſt come vnto him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
himſelfe, or els fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> another: not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
for he is impaſsible, or ſuch as
ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not ſuffer violence: not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> himſelfe;
for all ſuch accidents do proceed <hi>a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia,</hi>
that is, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the imbecillity, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection
of the ſubiect: but his <hi>Being</hi>
is moſt ſimple, &amp; infinitely perfect. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
all accidents do riſe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
               </hi> matter,
forme or compoſition of <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
               </hi> ſubiect. In
him is neither matter, forme, nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.
Now all things we ſee in this
world, do conſiſt, <hi>ex actu &amp; potentiâ,</hi> of
Perfection from <hi>God,</hi> &amp; imperfection
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues: for of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues they are
<hi>non entia,</hi> abſolutely nothing. Yea, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
the very Angels, and the ſoule it
ſelfe, are partakers of this compoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:18973:38"/>
(for nothing is <hi>purus actus,</hi> but <hi>God</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone)
therefore are they ſubiect to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents;
yet they which come neereſt
to perfection, are moſt free from ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents;
as that which is meere per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
hath no accidents at al. Know
then, that all the dignities of <hi>God</hi> are in
him eſſentially one <hi>God.</hi> For the <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>
of <hi>God,</hi> his <hi>Power,</hi> his <hi>Wiſedome,</hi> his
<hi>glory, &amp;c.</hi> beeing all <hi>infinite,</hi> do of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsity
concur in the nature of <hi>Infinity.</hi>
Whence it followeth, that whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
is in him, is eſſentially himſelfe:
therefore the power of <hi>God</hi> is not acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall,
or ſuch as may be imparted to
a man. The learned Hebrues accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to this do hold, that <hi>Euſoph</hi> or <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitie,</hi>
is not to bee numbred among
the other <hi>attributes of God:</hi> becauſe it
is that abſtract Vnity, wherinto they
all eſſentially concurre, &amp; from which
they al eſſentially proceed. And he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
by the way take another ſtrong argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the former queſtion: for
if GOD bee eſſentially a <hi>Father,</hi>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:18973:39"/>
then the terme correlatiue a <hi>Sonne,</hi>
muſt bee in the <hi>Godhead</hi> alſo, and that
eſſentially. But now againe ſee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
folly in your ſuppoſition. The
worke of our redemption is a worke
of infinite goodneſſe, mercie, power,
wiſedome and glory; therefore it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth,
that <hi>Christ</hi> the worker, had
infinite mercie, power, wiſedome, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now I demaund; had <hi>Christ</hi> this
infinite <hi>goodneſſe</hi> and <hi>power,</hi> ſo giuen to
him of <hi>God,</hi> that the <hi>Father</hi> himſelfe
had in the meane time none? This
you dare not ſay, for that were to ſay,
that GOD did ceaſe to bee GOD;
which cannot ſtand with his Eternitie.</p>
            <p>Now if GOD the <hi>Father</hi> had, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
this abſolute infinite
Power of <hi>Christ,</hi> of which he ſpake,
<hi>All power is giuen vnto me, both in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
and in earth:</hi> then it followeth that
either there were two infinities of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer;
or elſe that theſe two which had
this infinite <hi>Power,</hi> were all one Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:18973:39"/>
The firſt is againſt the nature
of Infinitie: or that is abſolutely infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,
which ſo comprehendeth all
things, as that it leaueth nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it ſelfe, and yet is not comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of any other. Beſides, if you
would ſay, that the <hi>Father</hi> and the
<hi>Sonne</hi> had each of them ſeuerall indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſible
infinite Powers; it muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that neither of their <hi>Powers</hi> were
abſolutely infinite: becauſe each of
them had not the infinite <hi>Power</hi> of the
other: And beſides, that both theſe
infinite <hi>Powers</hi> muſt bee conioyned
with infinite <hi>weakeneſſe,</hi> becauſe they
muſt be mutually ſubiected to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
<hi>Power</hi> one of the other. but both
theſe things are impoſsible. So you
ſee, that two Infinities can by no
meanes ſtand together: therefore it
followeth, that theſe two, to wit, the
<hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Sonne,</hi> are in <hi>Being one,</hi>
and that of <hi>infinite Power;</hi> and this is
that which I ſtriue for: which, as you
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:18973:40"/>
ſee, I haue concluded by your owne
aſſertion.</p>
            <p>The time would faile mee, to lay
before your eyes the manifold vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trueths,
which would inſue of your
poſition which ſauoureth neyther of
witte, iudgement, nor learning: And
therefore I ſee, how they which haue
once departed from the trueth, muſt
of neceſsitie runne into infinite ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities.
Therefore looke backe,
and be aſhamed of ſuch new-fangled
toyes, as you do dayly imagine, which
in trueth doe argue the great incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie
and vanitie of your minde,
and withall, ſuch palpable blindneſſe
of vnderſtanding, as the darkneſſe of
Egypt. For tell mee without ſelfe-li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
what ſound iudgement doth
this argue, to be driuen about with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
wind of doctrine? a Proteſtant,
a Browniſt, an Anabaptiſt, an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt.
What bringing vp? what gift
of learning and knowledge haue
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:18973:40"/>
you, that you ſhould preſume to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
your ſentence, againſt the faith
and doctrine of all the Christian
Churches in the world? Bluſh, and
<hi>learne with meekeneſſe the trueth of that
Word, which is able to ſaue your ſoule.</hi>
You may ſee by your owne miſerable
experience, what it is to forſake the
Vnitie of Faith, and the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Saints, who imbrace the
trueth of Gods word, and haue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
<hi>tokens that they are the true
Church,</hi> to wit, <hi>The word of God truely
taught, and the Sacraments duely admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtered.</hi>
What if there want perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
The Church militant muſt euer
confeſſe; <hi>I am louely, yet blacke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> For it
is impoſsible that any Church ſhould
be without imperfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſo long as the
world ſtandeth: but at the end <hi>it ſhall
bee preſented without ſpotte or wrinkle.</hi>
Therfore <hi>reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber from whence you are
fallen, &amp; repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; do the works of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes,
leſt Christ,</hi> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you ſo deſpite,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:18973:41"/>
               <hi>come againſt you ſhortly.</hi> The worke of
Christianitie is not in fooliſh queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and diſputing about needleſſe
ſubtilties, but in doing the workes of
trueth and righteouſneſſe. Pray and
endeuour your ſelfe thereto. And
till ſuch time as GOD for his <hi>Christs</hi>
ſake, vouchſafe to haue mercie on
you, the enemie of his SONNE,
and giue you grace to repent of this
great wickedneſſe, I am neither your
