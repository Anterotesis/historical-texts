            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

THE HUMBLE
PROPOSALS
And Deſires of His Excellency the Lord <hi>Fairfax,</hi> and of the general
Councel of Officers, in order to a ſpeedy proſecution of Juſtice,
and the Settlement formerly propounded by them.</head>
            <p>HAving, with others, for a long while ſadly
beheld and taſted, in your proceedings,
the miſerable fruits of Councels divided
and corrupted by Faction and perſonal Intereſt,
even to the neglect, betraying and caſting away
all thats publique and good, to the lengthning
out of endleſs troubles, burthen and damage to
the Kingdom, to the continuance and widening
of that iſſue of blood, whereby theſe Nations have
been ſo much polluted and conſumed, and to the
perpetual hazard of Bondage and Deſtruction to
them at laſt: And both we and many others ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
propounded foundations of Juſtice and Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement,
which are of evident Advantage and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
to the publique Intereſt, and clear from
any thing thats perſonal or particular; But find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that through th'aforeſaid Corruption and
Diviſions in your Councels, the ſame can obtain
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61448:2"/>
no place or conſideration at all: And foreſeeing
evidently that the condition of the Kingdom will
not bear delay of Settlement one way or other,
We conceive our ſelves and others that are ſenſible
hereof, to be neceſsitated unto ſome extraordinary
vigorous and ſpeedy way, whereby thoſe roots of
Faction, Diviſion, and private Intereſts may be
weeded out from amongſt you, and ſo your
Councels cleared and united, to the timely and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
proſecution of Juſtice, with a ſound Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement
and publique good to the Kingdom, and
to the ſpeedy introducing of ſuch a ſucceeding Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
wherein future Differences may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented,
and a general Acquieſcence obtained.</p>
            <p>Therefore ſeeing no better or other way, We
propound and demand as followeth:</p>
            <p>1. Whereas <hi>Denzil Hollis</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> 
               <hi>Lionel Copley</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr>
Major Gen: <hi>Maſſey,</hi> and others of your Members,
(whoſe Names you well know) were in the year
1647. impeached by your ſelves for Treaſon, or
for high Crimes and Miſdemeanors, in relation
to the Treaſonable Engagement in the City of
<hi>London,</hi> The violence then done upon the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and The levying of a new War, and other
evils in maintenance and proſecution thereof; and
upon clear proofs againſt them, were by your
cenſure expelled the Houſe, and diſabled from fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61448:3"/>
truſt therein, and upon new Writs iſſued out
new Members were choſen and return'd in ſome
of their rooms; and yet by the prevalence of their
Faction (<hi>When in the last Summers War divers faithful
Members were ingaged abroad upon neceſſary publique ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
and others through Malignant Tumults and Distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances
could not ſafely attend the Houſe</hi>) the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
were afterwards re-admitted to ſit in the
Houſe, and Vote as formerly, without any tryal
or ſatisfaction in the things whereof they were
accuſed: We demand, That all thoſe Members ſo
Impeached, may be forthwith ſecured, to be
brought to Juſtice or Trial for their ſaid Crimes;
and that ſuch others of their Faction, by whoſe
Votes, Councels and Confederacy they were ſo
re-admitted, may be ſecluded from the Houſe, and
not ſit as Judges for thoſe their confederates.</p>
            <p>2. Whereas by the Confederacy of Major Gen:
<hi>Brown</hi> now Sheriff of <hi>London,</hi> with the ſaid Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached
Members, the Scots were invited and
drawn in to invade this Kingdom the laſt Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
in ſomuch as when upon the actual Invaſion
the Houſe proceeded to declare them Enemies,
and thoſe that adhered to them Traytors; yet the
ſaid Confederates and other treacherous Members
(to the number of Ninety and odde, as upon the
diviſion of the Houſe appeared) did by their
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61448:3"/>
Councel and Votes endeavor to hinder the
Houſe from declaring againſt their confederate
Invaders; We deſire, That the ſaid Major Gen:
<hi>Brown</hi> may be ſecured and brought to judgement,
for that and other his treacherous Confederacies
or Correſpondencies with the publique and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
Enemies of the Kingdom (which we here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
charge him with, and ſhall be ready to make
proof of) And that the reſt of the Ninety and
odde perſons diſſenting in the ſaid Vote, may be
excluded, and not truſted further in your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels.</p>
            <p>3. Whereas in a continued Series of your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
for many moneths together, we have
ſeen the prevalence of the ſame treacherous, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
and divided Councels, through Factions and
private Intereſts, oppoſing or obſtructing Juſtice
in all kindes, diverting your Councels from any
thing of publique good, hindring any proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
to any ſuch Settlement, as would conſiſt
with Security to the publique Intereſt, or put a
real end to the Troubles, Burthens or Hazards of
the Kingdom, and precipitating into treacherous
and deſtructive Compliances and Conjunctions
with the acknowledged Enemies thereof; and
this we have have ſeen particularly in the corrupt
Councels and Reſolves of receding from, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calling
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61448:4"/>
the Votes of <hi>No more Addreſſes to the King,</hi>
&amp;c. (the juſtneſs and neceſsity whereof you had
once ſo cleared to the world) alſo in the Votes for
entertaining or ſeeking (after all that) a Perſonal
Treaty with the King your Priſoner, upon ſuch
Propoſitions as himſelf ſhould tender, as well as
your own, offering upon imperfect (and thoſe
but wreſted) Conceſsions from him, to Reſtore
him, with impunity, to Honor, Freedom, Safety,
and his Revenue, exempting all (even the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal)
Authors and Actors in the laſt Summers
War from capital Puniſhment or Tryal, and
bringing off the reſt with Fines or Cenſures
moſt inconſiderable to the publique Damage and
Miſchief they have done; whereby both they and
others are encouraged to renew and multiply the
Kingdoms Troubles: And laſtly, in the Votes
declaring the Kings paſt Conceſsions to be a
Ground for the Houſe to proceed upon, for the
Settlement of the PEACE of the Kingdom,
notwithſtanding the viſible inſufficiency and
defects of them in things eſſentially concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the publique Intereſt, and Liberties of the
Kingdom (as thoſe propounded in our late Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance
are) and in other matters both Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
and civil (from which, by expreſs Covenant
or publique Faith given, you were obliged not to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61448:4"/>
recede) In which Votes &amp; councels it is apparent,
thoſe that are guilty of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> have deſerted, betrayed
&amp; juſtly forfeited their Truſt for the publique; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch
that we dare appeal to all well affected or
reaſonable men, Whether there be any hopes by,
or with the conjunction of ſuch men in your
Councels, to have any ſound or timely Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to have any end of Troubles, Burthens or
Hazards, or any publique good done for the
Kingdom: We therefore moſt earneſtly deſire,
That all ſuch faithful Members who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
in theſe things, would immediately (by
Proteſtation and publique Declaration) acquit
themſelves from any guilt of, or concurrence in
the ſeveral Votes or Councels here before parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
mentioned, as corrupt or deſtructive, that
the Kingdom may know who they are that have
kept their Truſt, and diſtinguiſh them from the
reſt that have thus falſified the ſame; and that all
ſuch as cannot or ſhall not ſo acquit themſelves
particularly, may be immediately excluded or
ſuſpended the Houſe, and not readmitted, until
they ſhall have given clear ſatisfaction therein to
the Judgement of thoſe who now ſo acquit
themſelves, and the grounds of ſuch ſatisfaction
be publiſhed to the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>4. Thus, ſuch as by faithfulneſs have retained
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61448:5"/>
their Truſt, being ſet in a condition to purſue and
perform the ſame, without ſuch Interruptions,
Diverſions and Depravations of Councels, as
formerly, We ſhall deſire and hope you will
ſpeedily and vigorouſly proceed, To take order
for the execution of Juſtice, To ſet a ſhort period
to your own Power, To provide for a ſpeedy
Succeſsion of equal Repreſentatives, according
to our late Remonſtrance, wherein Differences
in the Kingdom may be ended, and we and others
may comfortably acquieſce; as (for our parts)
we hereby engage and aſſure you we ſhall.</p>
