            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ince I came to the Army,
I bleſſe God, I have ſeen
no temper there, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendency
to peace, and
the preſervation of the
Kingdom; and they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
unanimouſly, That when their juſt
grievances are ſatisfied, and they eſtated in
a free and cleer capacity as <hi>Subjects,</hi> as well
as <hi>Souldiers,</hi> becauſe they ſay, that will
flow down upon all their fellow ſubjects
in the <hi>Kingdome,</hi> who may be ſecured by
the Parliament as to their civill rites, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:154404:3"/>
juſt liberties, they ſhall freely disband, or
be commanded as the Parliament ſhall think
fit in their wiſdomes.</p>
            <p>There is a generall cry in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
as wee march, that the Army would
help them, and be their <hi>Mediatours</hi> to
the <hi>Parliament</hi> for <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:</hi>
They are generally much troubled
about the burning of ſome <hi>Petitions.</hi> The
Army are very ſenſible of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
grievances, being under a grievance
themſelves.</p>
            <p>The Country cry, <hi>Peace, Peace,</hi> let
us have no more Forces raiſed to make
new Warres. I hope the LORD will
give a right underſtanding amongſt peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that the Army are wholly for Peace
too.</p>
            <p>There is a <hi>Solemn Ingagement</hi> the whole
<hi>Army</hi> hath entred into in order to their
juſt grievances, at the laſt Rendezvou.
There is a mighty ſpirit raiſed up in the
Army for Juſtice and Righteouſneſſe; we
admire at it.</p>

               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:154404:3"/>

            <p>I bleſſe God, I know no <hi>Deſigne</hi>
here appearing, but <hi>Peace</hi> to the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi>
And this is the <hi>Principle</hi> of thoſe
who have the conduct of this <hi>Army,</hi> to
indulge and cheriſh the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> who
have any appearance of God, equally with
any other.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>King</hi>'s being here, I hope
ſince it was contrary to all our <hi>knowledge,</hi>
but to thoſe Troopers, and <hi>Cornet Joyce,</hi>
who acted the buſineſſe, to prevent (as

            <p>I am informed Sir <hi>GILBERT

with much confidence, That I hindred
the <hi>Army</hi> from Disbanding the <hi>Generals

They are an Army <hi>understand</hi> themſelves,
GOD is amongſt them; and this whole
yeer I have been with them, they can all
