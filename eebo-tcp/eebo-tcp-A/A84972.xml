            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A full and true Account of the taking Count <hi>Charles John Coningsmark,</hi> lately Impeached as the principle contriver of the Barbarous and Bloody Murther of <hi>Thomas Thinn</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> with the manner of his being diſcover'd on Board a <hi>Sweeds</hi> Ship at <hi>Graveſend,</hi> in the habit of a Seaman, on the 19. of this inſtant <hi>February.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>AFter the Bloody Murther was committed upon the Perſon of <hi>Thomas Thinn</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> the Actual Murtherers were diſcovered (as we may ſay) by Miracle, but the account of that being already made known, we ſhall not trouble the Reader to repeat it, but proceed to our preſent Relation, which was much after the ſame manner.</p>
            <p>Captain <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rats</hi> upon his Examination, having confeſſed that what he did was upon the account of Count <hi>Charles John Coningsmark,</hi> his Majeſty was pleaſed to order, that a diligent Search ſhould be made, in order to apprehend him, of which, (as 'tis ſuppoſed) he having notice, ſhifted his Lodging ſo often, that although he was traced from place to place, and narrowly purſued, yet could not be met withal, whereupon order was given to put him into the <hi>Gazett,</hi> exactly deſcribed, with the reward of 200 pounds to any that could bring him to Juſtice. When on <hi>Saturday</hi> laſt, ſomewhat late in the Evening, Information was given to ſome perſon of Quality, that a Seamans wife at <hi>Eriff,</hi> being asked for her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, ſhould ſay, that he was gone on Board a <hi>Sweeds</hi> Veſſel, which was to carry over a Perſon of Quality, which words being taken notice of, they farther en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired into the matter, defiring to know who it was, ſhe reply'd ſhe knew not, but that ſhe having been on board with her Husband, and there ſeen him, gave a Deſcription of him ſo near, that ſuch as heard it, did verily believe that it might be the ſame Man that was deſcribed in the <hi>Gazett,</hi> and told her what they thought, to which ſhe reply'd, ſhe knew not who he was, but if it was him, her Husband knew nothing of the matter, and added, that ſhe believed the Ship might lie at <hi>Woolwich.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Notice being given, ſeveral Perſons having a Warrant to apprehend him, went on Board ſuch Ships as they ſuſpected and knew were ready to Sail, ſpending a great part of <hi>Sunday</hi> Morning in ſo doing, but not finding him there, juſt as they were about to Land, news was brought that a <hi>Sweeds</hi> Veſſel was fallen down to <hi>Graveſend,</hi> whereupon taking Boat, they went down with all ſpeed, where they found as had been Related, and after ſome diſpute went on Board, there being about 60 Seamen (all <hi>Sweeds)</hi> in the Ship, when they were on Board, they ſearched the Cabins, Decks, and Holes, and finding no Perſon in any Gentile garb, they ſuſpected he might be there in diſguiſe, when view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Seamen well, they found him between Decks in Seamens habit, Smoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Pipe of Tobacco; when being aſſured it was him, they commanded all Perſons preſent, in the Kings-name, to be aiding and aſſiſting to them, and thereupon Seized him, and upon ſearch, found a naked Sword under his Coat on one ſide, and a Piſtol tucked in his Girdle on the other; when taking him from on Board, they put him into their Boat and brought him on Shoar, ſending an Expreſs to relate what had happened. And this Morning he was brought to <hi>White-Hall,</hi> where he was ordered to the Secretaries Chamber, there to remain in private, till ſuch time as the Counſel ſate, and then to be brought upon his Examination as to the matter of the aforeſaid Murther.</p>
