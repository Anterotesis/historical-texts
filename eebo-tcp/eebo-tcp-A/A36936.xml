            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
Author's Preface.</head>
            <p>IF I had taken the leaſure to make a
ſerious Reflection on the boldneſs of
my deſign, I had not publiſht this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of my Voyages; the raw Age in
which I made them, had been a ſufficient
reaſon to diſcourage me from it, beſides
the conſideration of the polite Age we
live in. For tho' I have followed Truth
with the greateſt ſeverity, yet theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
want perhaps thoſe other Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
that are apt to recommend things
of this nature to the Reader, ſuch as Air
and Stile in the writing of them, ſo much
valued at preſent.</p>
            <p>Yet however devoid of theſe Ornaments,
I ſhall venture to preſent them to the
Publick, after ſo ingenious an acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in hopes the young Traveller will
meet with a mild and eaſy cenſure of his
firſt attempts, while he gives the Publick
a moſt exact account of the particulars of
Monſieur <hi>Duqueſne</hi>'s Voyage and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings
in the <hi>Indies,</hi> which has been ſo
earneſtly and impatiently expected; of his
<pb facs="tcp:56915:3"/>
Engagements with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch;</hi>
with the Advantages he has gain'd of them;
and his Conduct in bringing back a Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron
ſafe with which his Majeſty entru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
him, through a Voyage of ſix Thouſand
Leagues, through Storms and Tempeſts, and
all the rage and power of the Enemy.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the Reader will be pleas'd with
the variety of the Subject with which I
have furniſht this Relation, which can't
but render it the more agreable and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining;
as likewiſe with ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks
curious enough, concerning the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Nations and Countries thro' which
we paſt, and the horrible Tempeſt that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
us in our return in the Latitude of
<hi>Maſcarin.</hi> I have writ all in the natural
order in which they fell out, with exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and fidelity, obliging my ſelf to omit
nothing of moment, and to relate no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of which I was not an Eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:
So after acquainting the Reader
before hand with ſome Repetitions, which
by a frequent recurring of the ſame things
were unavoidable, I have nothing more to
deſire for his ſatisfaction, or my own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
but that the ſtile had been more
polite and correct, there being nothing elſe
wanting to compleat his ſatisfaction.</p>

expected their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects

ruin'd, as being too much employ'd

the Agreſſor, and ſet on them firſt
and their Factories in thoſe Parts; a

the King appointed ſix Ships;

               <p>THE Squadron thus Arm'd, had

the 24th of <hi>February</hi> (90,) Monſieur
<hi>Duqueſne</hi> coming aboard at Five in the

were under Sail, with the Wind at
<hi>North,</hi> and a delicate Gale as could
be wiſh'd, but it did not laſt long,
coming about at Ten next Morning;
ſo that we were obliged to put back
again; but by the 27th we Sailed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,

the Wind being more favourable
than at firſt.</p>
               <p>We made ſuch way, that we ſoon
loſt ſight of Land, which we were

The Wind contiued ſo favourable, that
by the Tenth of <hi>March</hi> we doubled
<hi>Cape Feneſter:</hi> The Sea is commonly
Boyſterous in this Latitude, and the
paſſage dangerous, and there's no
bearing much Sail here.</p>
               <p>The Sixth Day became remarkable,
by an Accident that happen'd to us.
The Gabier, who is one appointed to
look to the Maſts and Tackling, hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the Foremaſt Sail-yard, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hapily
fell into the Sea, which was
then very boiſterous; we did all we
could to ſave him, threw out Ropes,
hoiſted out the Boat, but all in vain,
for the Storm was ſo violent, that he
ſunk preſently.</p>
               <p>Great are the terrors of this Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

               </head>
               <p>WE Steer'd our Courſe for the
<hi>Madera</hi> Iſlands, where with
pleaſure, we waited to take in ſome
refreſhments, tho' 'twas not above
Nine Days that we had loſt ſight of
Land. But the Currents which we
met having carried us too far to the
<hi>Eaſt,</hi> or rather to the great Foggs at
Land, having hinder'd us from the
ſight of it; we left it to the Right,
without perceiving it, till we had
doubled it. The 9th we diſcovered
the Iſle of <hi>Savages,</hi> which was the
firſt Land we made ſince we parted
from <hi>Port-Lewis;</hi> 'tis ſcituated in 30
Degrees of the <hi>Northern</hi> Latitude, and
Twenty Minutes Longitude. This is
an uninhabited Iſland, very dangerous
for the Steep Craggy Rocks that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viron
it for above a League; that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56915:8"/>
ſcarce a Boat can go a Shoar; by this
ſight of Land we judged we were
not far from the <hi>Canary</hi> Iſlands, which
doubtleſs we ſhould have come to
ſight of, the next Morning, if we had
not been delay'd by a Calm, which
happily laſted but a little while; for,
in the Evening it began to blow a brisk
Gale, ſo that by the Eleventh, at 7 a
Clock in the Morning, we were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
Thirteen Lagues of the Pike of
<hi>Teneriffe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By Noon we were near it, being in
Twenty Eight Degrees, Thirty Six
Minutes, <hi>North</hi> Latitude, and Three
Hundred and Fifty Nine Degrees of
Longitude. The Pike of <hi>Teneriffe</hi> is
ſeen Forty Leagues off, and undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
may paſs for one of the higheſt
Mountains in the World. Some make
it ſeven Leagues high, others Twelve.
This proud Mountain wraps its head
in the Clouds, which appears white,
by reaſon of the Snow that covers
it Winter and Summer, riſing through
the middle Region of the Air, which
makes it ſo cold that none was ever
able to mount it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:56915:9"/>
Behind this Mountain ſtands the
Town of <hi>Canary,</hi> of which the Iſland
bears the Name; which is very Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and abounds in Corn, and is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
for the rich Wines it produces,
which are carried to all Parts of the
World. Three are beſides Three o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Iſlands; the firſt, that of <hi>Gomer,</hi>
of the ſame ſide with the Pike, and
not above Six or Seven Leagues diſtant.
The ſecond is <hi>Palm</hi> Iſland, memorable
for the Death of Forty Jeſuits, who
going to <hi>Brazill,</hi> to Preach the Faith
of Jeſus Chriſt, were there Martyr'd
by the <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> about a Hundred
Years ago. This latter is oppoſite to
the Pike of <hi>Teneriffe,</hi> and is about
Twelve or Thirteen Leagues diſtant.
We paſt between theſe two, having
<hi>Palme</hi> Iſland on the Right, and the
Pike of <hi>Teneriffe</hi> on the Left. And
the laſt is the Iſle of <hi>Fer,</hi> where Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers
commonly place the firſt
<hi>Meridian.</hi> Theſe four Iſlands belong
to <hi>Spain,</hi> ſo that we could not take a
view of them, but at a diſtance, by
reaſon of the War between us and it.</p>

               <p>THe Wind which had hardly ſtir'd
all day, began to blow freſh in
the Evening, ſo that we cou'd eaſily
perceive the Trading Winds, which are
ſo uſeful for Sailing; they are call'd
ſo by reaſon of their continuing three
or four months without changing. Theſe
ſort of Winds Blow always from the
North Eaſt in the Southern parts, and
from the South Eaſt in the Northern
parts, which very much perplexes cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
people to find out the true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of it. Some maintain, that the
Trading Winds are no other then
thoſe which blow from the Weſt, and
the North with great violence, which
paſſing over <hi>Europe</hi> to the Eaſt and
South, rarify and grow weaker as
they approach the warmer Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates;
on the contrary, in the Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56915:10"/>
parts, the Weſtern and Southern
Winds blowing with the ſame vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
towards <hi>Africa,</hi> are thence dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
towards the Eaſt and North, and
abate by degrees as they approach the
warmths of the Line, and quite ceaſe
when they reach it.</p>
               <p>Others explain this matter after a
different manner; they will have it,
that the exceſſive heats of the Line
draw theſe Winds from the Poles,
where the Exhalations and Vapors,
which are the matter of the Winds,
being ſtronger and in greater abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
cauſe more violent and laſting
ones, and that afterwards theſe Winds
or Exhalations are drawn towards the
Zone, and there abated by the exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
heat.</p>
               <p>Behold the beſt Account I could
meet with, to ſatisfy thoſe who are
curious in this matter; but whatever
the Natural Cauſe of them may be, it
may be truly ſaid, they are the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Winds that blow.</p>

to the utmoſt ſeverity of the <hi>Chriſtian

at their Catechiſms and Sermons on
<hi>Sundays,</hi> and at Maſs every morning,
with prayers at the end for the King;
in the evening we ſaid our beads, and
the Litany of the Bleſſed Virgin,
making an <hi>Examen</hi> of <hi>Conſcience</hi> on our

               </p>
               <p>Great was the happineſs and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
we had from the company

the ſick; one of the <hi>Mandarins</hi> nam'd

till he had adminiſterd extream <hi>Unction,</hi>
and the <hi>Holy Euchariſt</hi> to him. Of
theſe three Envoys of the King of <hi>Siam,</hi>
he converted two to the <hi>Catholick
Religion,</hi> Baptizing them at <hi>Breſt,</hi> and
'tis to be preſum'd that the third
would ſoon have yeilded too, to the
Authority of his holy Life, as well
as that of his Arguments.</p>
               <p>All the funeral Honours due to a
perſon of Quality, were paid to this
deceas'd <hi>Mandarin:</hi> Four <hi>Gard Marines</hi>
held the corners of the Pall, and after

the uſual prayers on the occaſion,
threw him into the Sea, with five
Guns, fir'd at a diſtance one from
another, which made it more ſad and
Sollemn; 'twas believ'd in the reſt of
the ſhips that 'twas an Enſign dy'd, ſo
to honour him, and to teſtify to their
Admiral their concern for him, they
ſtruck their ſails, and lay by, rolling
in his way ſadly, as if there were
none to govern them; as ſoon as the
ſhip paſt by, they hoiſt their Sails

               <p>THE Commandant Monſieur <hi>de

<hi>Duqueſnes</hi> orders, to complement

agreed to what was deſir'd, and not
only ſo, but promis'd we ſhould be
furniſht with Beef and Mutton, tho'
very ſcarce among themſelves; but
when it came to the ceremony of the
Salute, this raw young Governor,
who in all probality was ignorant of
what was really our due, refuſed to
anſwer Gun for Gun; but the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandant
provokt at it, told him; that
the <hi>French</hi> expected other returns, and
that ſeeing he ſtood ſo ſtiff upon't,
they would not ſalute him at all:
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56915:13"/>
'Twas then he perceiv'd he miſtook
his men, and ſo preſently agreed to
five Guns each,</p>
               <p>He made a preſent of two dozen of
ſweet <hi>Oranges</hi> and ſome <hi>Chocolet</hi> to
Monſieur <hi>de Pouriere,</hi> having neither
wine nor ſweet-meats tho' very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
here; who after he had receiv'd
them, went to give our Commandant
an account of what paſt, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
him he had been inform'd by
the Governor, that two <hi>Dutch</hi> and one
<hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhip parted thence but three
days before, bound for the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi>
and that they expected two more
ſuddainly: We lay at anchor till <hi>Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi>
evening, without perceiving any,
whence we purſu'd our Voyage, not
a little troubl'd to miſs 'em, for they
could hardly eſcape falling into our
hands: Being now late, we omitted
the Salute till next morning, which
was <hi>Palm-Sunday;</hi> when after our
<hi>Almoner</hi> had ſaid <hi>Maſs,</hi> we ſaluted
them with five Guns, and they returned
the ſame number.</p>
               <p>Being curious to go a ſhoar, I got
leave of the Commandant, and ſo
went in company with <hi>F. Tachard,</hi>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:56915:13"/>
and an Officer, who carri'd a ſmall
Preſent from Monſieur <hi>Duqueſne</hi> to
the Governour; at our landing, we
ſaw ſome <hi>Negro's</hi> that were quite
naked, excepting a ragg about their
waſts to cover their nakedneſs.
There's a Chapel on the ſhoar dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
to the <hi>Bleſſed Virgin,</hi> and a little
further a Battery of four Iron Guns;
we were forced to climb, 'till we came
to a certain Baſtion, on which were
mounted ſix old Iron Guns, of which
the biggeſt was a ſix pounder. This
is the beſt fortify'd part of the Iſland,
where the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> keep a Garriſon,
but the Soldiers are fitter to be pitty'd
than fear'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>F. Tachard</hi> askt them news of the
Governour; they ſhew'd him a Church
where he was, into which we enterd,
when he preſently roſe from his ſeat,
and gave us a graceful ſalute, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
after talking ſome time with him
in <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> went out; but I conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd
ſome time obſerving the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,

               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:56915:14"/>
They are more devout and ſolemn
than we, but we were a little ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz'd
at the negreſs women half naked
in the Church, who as they ſtar'd at
us, ſo we could not but ſtare at them;
as likewiſe at the Governour's Guard,
which was a wretched one; their
Arms were a Pike and a Sword of an
extraordinary length, with a pair of
Beads about their necks.</p>
               <p>In the midſt of them ſtood the little
Governor, of about twenty year old;
a Native of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> pretty tall, but
meanly clad, and of a poor meen and
air.</p>
               <p>This is a wretched Country, and
fitter to ſtarve than live in; they have
their wine and bread from <hi>Lisbon,</hi> or
from the <hi>Cunarys,</hi> the latter is 8 pence
a pound, and the firſt half a Crown
a Bottel, which holds no more than
the Chopin of <hi>France;</hi> 'tis true the
<hi>Negro's</hi> who are naturally fober, uſe
little wine, or even ſo much as bread;
living for the moſt part of dry cake
well preſt, which is made of the root
of a tree call'd <hi>Macoc,</hi> the Juice of
which is a ſubtil poiſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:56915:14"/>
They are all Soldiers or Slaves,
and ſo given to robbery, that its
hard to eſcape them, if they meet one
in a by place, they are very fond of
knives, ribbon, needles, but chiefly
of Biſcuit, for which they readily give
Oranges, Goiaves, Bannanes, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
other fruits, they have large
proportion'd bodies, ſhort friz'd hair,
little beard, and whither hunting or
walking, they ſtill carry bows and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
about 'em.</p>
               <p>No one will wonder at the ſterillity
of the Country, when he is told it
has not rain'd there in four years time;
which has made the ground ſo parcht
and barren, that of 25000 inhabitants
which it had, there dy'd 6000 in two
years time of hunger, as one of their
Prieſts told me, with whom I diſcours'd
ſome time in Latin.</p>
               <p>The Cloathing of the women is
only a piece of white or blew cotton
cloath, that covers them from the
waſt to the knee, the reſt of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
is naked, going barefoot and bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed,
only ſometimes wearing an
ordinary handkerchief round their
heads, and for the moſt part gold
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56915:15"/>
Rings, or three wooden pins in their
ears. Theſe women have their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
beauties, as tall, proper, comely,
and well proportioned bodies, and a
certain great air, eſpecially when they
walk; they ſmoak much, and are
ſcarce ever ſeen without a pipe.</p>
               <p>I was to ſee the Town of <hi>Saintiague,</hi>
about three Leagues from the place
our ſhips lay at anchor; where I was
told that he whom I took for Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
was only the Lieutenant; the
Governor reſiding always at <hi>Saintiague.</hi>
This is a little Town in a bottom,
ſcituated by the ſea ſide, thro' which
a large River takes its courſe, deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the neighbouring Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
which ſurround it; It has a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of three hundred houſes; the beſt
part of the Inhabitants are <hi>Portugueſe,</hi>
the reſt <hi>Negro's,</hi> theſe laſt go naked,
the former clad after their own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion,
having all Beads about their
necks.</p>
               <p>There's a Biſhop in this Twon, a
Native of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> of the order of <hi>St.
Frances;</hi> and two Convents, one of
Men and the other of Women.
There's a Fort raiſed at the end of the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56915:15"/>
Town, mounted with two caſt Guns,
and at the foot of it eight, and three
Iron Guns, mouthing towards the ſea;
hard by, is the Iſle of <hi>Fougo,</hi> or the
<hi>Fiery Iſland,</hi> where there's a very
high mountain, whoſe top caſts, fourth
flames continually, with a thick ſmoak.
This is all I could remark in the ſhort
ſtay I made here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Saintiague</hi> is an Iſland of <hi>Cape Verde,</hi>
belonging to the <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> which is
ſcituated in fourteen degrees, thirty ſix
Minutes North Lat. and three hundred
and fifty three degrees thirty Minutes
Longitude. I have already ſaid, that
proviſions were ſo ſcarce here, that
we could have but one Bullock, which
was divided amongſt us all, and ſome
ſheep for the Commodant, but plenty
of excellent Fiſh is caught here. We
got ſome barrels of freſh water
which was none of the beſt, and hard
to come by, having it out of a dirty
Ciſtern, which was a great diſtance
from the ſea. After we had fill'd our
empty Casks with it, Monſieur <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſne</hi>
weigh'd Anchor, and left <hi>Sain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiague,

               <p>'Tis then that troops of Fiſh leap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
above the water of all ſides, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite
the ſeamen to take them. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
one day when the ſea was a

beheld ſhoals of fiſh leaping above the
water, and continuing ſo as long as
their fins were wet, to avoid the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit
of the <hi>Bonites,</hi> a large fiſh, who
is a great devourer of the reſt; the

their natural Element, and have much
a do to ſave themſelves by their often
riſeing above it, being often ſnapt by
them in the air; ſo that its almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
for them to eſcape the enemy,
who inceſſantly purſues them in vaſt
numbers. We took a great many of
theſe <hi>Bonites,</hi> which reſemble Shads,
but are more ſavory and firm.</p>
               <p>We were within five or ſix Degrees
of the Line, and ſo had continual
Calms, which were almoſt unſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and by which we ſuffer'd extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
our Wine and Victuals were
ſpoil'd, and our Vigor conſum'd, and
our Diſtemper encreaſt daily through
the long and violent heats; the very
air that ſhould keep us alive, almoſt
ſuffocated us, night and day the heat
was ſo exceſſive, that the very Sealing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wax
we had in our trunks melted.
The reſt of this Month paſt without
any thing remarkable, ſave that it
thunderd, with violent winds and rain,
which forwarded us very much in our

'Twas not a little gaſtly, in the
horrors of dark and tempeſtious nights,
to ſee the Lightnings perform the office
of the day; which gave us no other
proſpect, but that of a riſing and a
yawning Ocean, into which two of
our Men fell.</p>
               <p>The fifth of <hi>April</hi> our Carpenter
being at the ſhips head, fell into the
ſea; but being a good ſwimmer, he
kept himſelf above water till he got
hold of a rope, and then cry'd out for
help; one of the Seamen preſently
gave him his foot to take hold of,
which breaking, he drew the other in
with him, we gave 'em all the aſſiſt-
we could, and with much ado ſaved
them both at laſt.</p>
               <p>The way we made this night,
brought us conſiderably nearer the

quite ſpent with the intollerable heats
we had endur'd for fiefteen days time;
only thoſe rains which fell helpt to

               <p>Taking a view of this Village,

which they told me was a Pagod, or
Temple, in which theſe wretches wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
an Oxe's head, the forehead being

made him a grot in the wall, adorn'd
with ſhell work, where they plac'd

they remov'd a little after we went in,
whither 'twas they believ'd us unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to look on't, or that they obſerv'd
we ſlighted it as much as it deſerv'd:
The middle of the Pagod was matted,
and on the right ſide as you enter,
there was a pole ſtuck in the ground
forkt at one end, ſupporting ſome
mother of pearl burnt; on the inſide,
which I ſuppoſe ſerv'd for a lamp;
and a little lower of the ſame ſide,
was a ſtair-caſe of 5 ſteps, leading to

at ſo great a diſtance. When we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd,
it was the time of their <hi>Ramadam,</hi>
or <hi>Lent,</hi> during which they mayn't
eat, drink, or ſmoak 'till the ſun's
ſet, and they are ſo exact in't, that
no perſwaſions or threats can make
'em do otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Negro's</hi> appear'd more Savage
than they of <hi>Saintiague,</hi> ruder in their
manner of living, but more plain in
their dealing; they are large, and
ſtrong bodied, but very fearful; a
Piſtol ſhot will ſcare them ſo, that
they'll run into the woods to hide,
ſo much they fear fire Arms. They
were long beards, and their hair cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their ſhoulders; for 'tis to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd,
that to the ſouth of the Line,
they all have them thus, and to the
North, have ſhort friz'd hair; they
all go naked, having only a rag of
Linen to cover their nakedneſs,
and ſome wear beads about their
necks without croſſes, and holes in
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56915:26"/>
their Ears that your finger will go
through.</p>
               <p>I could never imagine that theſe
Savages could be ſo jealous of their
Wives, for they hid them in their
Cottages as we paſt by, that we
might not ſee them, judging our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
I ſuppoſe by their own;
we ſaw, ſome of their women who
are not eaſily to be diſtinguiſhed
from their Men, but by their habit;
which conſiſts of a piece of Linen that
croſſes their Stomacks, and ſo falls
down their breaſts, with another which
binds their Thghes behind and before
like drawers: They are very wild,
for when I but touch'd one of their
ears, to obſerve three little pieces of
wood ſhe had in them, ſhe skriekt
out, and ran as if I intended to eat
her.</p>
               <p>Tho' Idolaters, yet they are very
temperate and ſober; and for the moſt
part feed only on fiſh, fruits and Rice,
and rarely eat any fleſh, tho' they
have plenty. Their beſt drink is
<hi>Tarry,</hi> which is very refreſhing, and
much reſembles the Cider made of
pears in <hi>Britany,</hi> it coſts them no more
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:56915:27"/>
pains than the reſt of their proviſions,
which the unmanur'd ſoil freely fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes
'em with of its own accord.
It is no more than cutting the bottom
of the Palm trees, and placing Veſſels
beneath to receive it.</p>

about, the <hi>Rock</hi> at the ſecond diſcharge
ſplitting the Capſtain, and wounded
two and twenty of his men, upon

with all the ſpeed ſhe could, which
Monſieur <hi>Pouriere</hi> who was reſolv'd to
follow her cloſe, no ſooner obſerv'd
but he cut his Cables too, and call'd to
us to board her for that ſhe was juſt
ſailing away.</p>
               <p>Our Commandant knowing what
he had to do, preſently tackt, and
got under the wind with her, who
fir'd on us with both her broad ſides,
ſeeing herſelf oblig'd to paſs between

ſhot into her, but we had no ſooner
ſuffer'd her to go a little a head of us,
but we ply'd her with our great and
ſmall ſhot from both our ſhips, the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhip ſcarce firing at all, and
thinking of nothing but of making
her eſcape by the favour of the
night.</p>
               <p>But his endeavours were to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
for we were reſolv'd to ply him
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:56915:29"/>
cloſe all night; after the third diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge,
the Commandant order'd us
to ceaſe firing, while a meſſage was
ſent to him, that if he would not ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render,
he ſhould be hang'd up, on
the Main-yard; this threatening meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,
which might have frightend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
gave him ſo little concern,
that he anſwer'd it with as many great
Guns as he could, at which we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd
at the undaunted courage and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
of the man, to ſtand it out
at ſuch a deſperate rate, when there
was no hopes of eſcapeng.</p>
               <p>So we renew'd the fight, and were
board and board with him, our
Mainyards almoſt touching for a
good while, 'twas now we gall'd him
terribly with our great and ſmall ſhot,
and ſcarce one miſs'd, when if we
might judge according to appearance,
he muſt needs have laſt half his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.
Yet for all this he ſhew'd no
ſign of fear, or any thing like it; for
we could not hear 'em ſo much as
once cry for Quarter: But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
receiving our ſhot without fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
he lengthen'd out his Sprit-ſail
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:56915:30"/>
that he might come cloſe to us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
we had a deſign to board him,
at which time he long'd for nothing
more, for if we had, he was reſolv'd
to blow us up, tho' at the expence of
ſetting himſelf a fire, but happily the
night coming on, was the cauſe the
Commandant gave orders not to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
it, ſo being contented for the
preſent with what we had done, we
ſtood aloof, and lay at ſome diſtance
one from another, only the <hi>Rock</hi>
would not quit her a moment, but
continued ſtill firing inceſſantly at
her.</p>
               <p>By this time the reſt of the Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron
came up, who preſently began
to fire on the unhappy <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> and
ſurrounded him of all ſides, that the
ſhip ſcarce knew which way to turn
her head; the bullets fell like hail in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her, and the night was now ſo dark
that one could ſcarce diſcern any thing,
which was the cauſe that our ſhips
incommoded one another, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
our lanthors were all fill'd
with lights.</p>
               <p>The enemy having for ſome time
receiv'd a great many ſhot from us,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:56915:30"/>
without making any return, and
thought of nothing but meeting with
a convenient opportunity to make their
eſcape. When Monſieur <hi>Duqueſne</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
'twas in vain to waſt povvder
and ſhot, and that 'twas to no purpoſe
to think of reducing him before day,
ſent an arm'd ſloup with an Officer,
commanding all the ſhips not to fire
any more, but only keep a ſtrict watch
on her all night.</p>
               <p>It might be now about eleven a
clock, the action having laſted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
intermiſſion ſince eight, when the
Commandant order'd us to repoſe our
ſelves for a while; and the ſloop going
to the <hi>Rock</hi> with theſe orders; Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieut
<hi>de Pouriere,</hi> the Captain of it,
ſent us a young <hi>Malouin</hi> Seaman, who
made his eſcape from aboard the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
by ſwiming, and had come aboard
him, after his ſecond diſcharge.</p>
               <p>This man inform'd us, that the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Captain, after giving all his
men a large bowl of Canary, exhorted
them to fight it out to the laſt; tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them at the ſame time too, that
he was reſolv'd to ſet fire to the ſhip
before ever it ſhould fall into our hands,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:56915:31"/>
if we prov'd to be <hi>French;</hi> which he
but too well perform'd, as you'l ſee
by what follows. The ſhips name
was the <hi>Herbert<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> built for eighty
Guns; carrying but 54; and two
hunderd and fifty men, with about
fourſcore paſſengers, amongſt whom
was a rich <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bankrupt, who had
fourſcore thouſand crowns in ſilver,
having with him his wife and a daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
a great beauty about twenty years
old, with two young ſons, one of
which was born under the Line.</p>
               <p>He told us the Cargo of the ſhip
conſiſted of Laces, and Brocard of
gold, ſcarlet cloaths, Bevers, Iron, To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco,
Canary wines, and a great
deal of Money; ordered for commerce,
and paying off the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſoldiers
in the ſervice of the Company, who
had receiv'd no pay in four years time,
and that if taken would prove a vaſt
rich Prize, which very much rejoyc'd
us. But the deſperate Captain took
care that none ſhould be the richer for't,
or gain by what he loſt.</p>
               <p>So we gave over firing in good time,
for beſides that it ſignify'd nothing;
we ſhould a done our ſelves as much
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56915:31"/>
damage as the enemy; at length he
made four or five ſhot at us, to waken
our Squadron out of that profound
ſteep it ſeem'd to have been in, and
then lay ſtill; and continuing ſo for
ſome time, about two in the morning
the wind blowing freſh, ſhe made all
the ſail ſhe could to eſcape the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
danger.</p>
               <p>He thought the ſame happineſs
would have attended him now; which
he had had at the <hi>Canary</hi> Iſlands,
where its ſaid he clear'd himſelf of
three ſtout <hi>Algerines</hi> that ſurrounded
him; but he ſoon found to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
for he was no ſooner under ſail,
but we began to follow him, when
ſeeing there was no poſſibillity of eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and that as ſoon as 'twas day, we
ſhould bear down upon him in a line,
and ſink him; Fir'd with rage and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair,
he took the moſt cruel reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the world; and without any more
delay ſet fire to his ſhip, placing two
cheſts of powder under the higheſt
part of the ſtern, near the Mizzen
Maſt; making his eſcape himſelf thro'
the Gunners room in his boat, in which
they perceiv'd a light, but he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:56915:32"/>
to hide it that they might not
follow him.</p>
               <p>This dreadful ſpectacle amaz'd us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly,
and as eargerly as we endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to attack her before, as haſtily we
attempted to avoid her now; our men
lookt on't as belonging to themſelves;
and could not but cenſure the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
for acting ſo cruel and inhumane
a part, as not to ſave his Cargo, or
periſh with them himſelf. But this
horrible proceeding quite ruin'd the
opinion, we had before conceiv'd of
his bravery.</p>
               <p>Some of our men heard theſe miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
people crying out like the damn'd,
and runing up the bolt ſprit in crowds,
endeavouring to avoid the flames,
which rag'd ſo violenty, but 'twas in
vain. The ſhip continually burning
for three hours, when at length the
flames catching in the powder room,
it blew up all at once; ſo that in leſs
than half a quarter of an hour there
was nothing to be ſeen of that rich
ſhip, but dreadful conflagration.</p>
               <p>Our ſingle ſhip fir'd for her ſhare
no leſs than 200 and 80 guns, and we
had five men kill'd and ſix wounded;
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:56915:32"/>
I could not receive an exact account
of what the reſt ſuffer'd, but I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
we ſuffer'd moſt; after having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
what damage we ſuſtain'd, we
ſteer'd our courſe North North Eaſt,
and left <hi>Amiouam</hi> behind us, Monſieur

Paradice, which I leave to the

               <p>This Iſle is plac'd between 6 and 10
Deg. of North Lat. and 103 Deg. of
Long. its form is round, and may be
about 250 Leagues in compaſs, or

               <p>Coaſting the Iſland we diſcoverd
two ſail a head of us, who ſeem'd to
keep at a diſtance from the Iſland, but
preſently made to land when they
ſaw us. Our Commandant impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to know whence they were,
thought to ſnap them by hoiſting up
<hi>Engliſh</hi> colours, and making all the ſail
he could; the <hi>Dragon</hi> as the ſwifteſt
ſailer went to cut off their way, and
when we were vvithin ſhot of them,
vve fir'd a gun, as did the <hi>Dragon</hi> too,
and the ball ſo ſcar'd em that inſtead
of coming aboard as vve hop'd; they
preſently fled for refuge to a houſe
by the ſea ſide; a fevv hours after, the
Sentinel vvho vvas on the top, cry'd
a <hi>Sail;</hi> I can't eaſily deſcribe the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:56915:35"/>
motions of joy it caus'd amongſt
us; ſome vvent up to the round-top,
others to the fane, others vvho could
not ſo eaſily do it, ſtood in the ſhrouds,
and the reſt made uſe of their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectives
to diſcover a veſſel, which
could not yet be ſeen but by her top,
yet after an hours ſailing, ſhe was
plainly diſern'd, to be three Leagues
off.</p>
               <p>The Sun was already ſet, and we
fear'd but one thing; which was, that
ſhe would ſail off in the night and ſo
eſcape us, by taking a contrary courſe,
ſo that we ſcarce knew what to do,
tho' we were ſure ſhe lay at anchor,
our Commandant conſiderd of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
loath to do, as he had done before
at <hi>Amiouam,</hi> where he ſhot a matter
of eight hunderd ſhot at random in
the night, when fifty would ſerve by
day light, ſo he reſolv'd to ly by
her all night, without attempting any
thing; by which means we ſhou'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
her the more in her miſtake of
us.</p>
               <p>So we anchord in 25 fathom water
at ſeven a-clock, and next morning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>25th.</hi> weighed anchor again
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:56915:36"/>
at 5 in the morning the wind blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
freſh quickly brought us to the
ſight of her, for which we were ſo
much concern'd all night, leaſt ſhe
ſhould make her eſcape. We firſt heard
Maſs, after that we breakfaſted, and
then Monſieur <hi>Duquſne</hi> orderd to hoiſe
up <hi>Engliſh</hi> colours; the Enemy miſtak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their friends, anſwer'd us by hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out <hi>Dutch</hi> colours, whithour ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from where they lay, giving us all
the time and opportunity we could
wiſh for, to attack them, and now indeed
it was in vain to attempt an eſcape,
if they had known we were <hi>French.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Veſſel lay at Anchor in the
road of <hi>Mevelle,</hi> under the ſhelter of
a high ground, which hinder'd her
having a ſight of us the night before.
The <hi>Rock</hi> whom we follow'd enter'd
into the ſame road, and anchor'd by
her ſide, which ſhe had ſcarce done,
but the <hi>Dutch</hi> underdanding what we
were, endeavour'd to get aſhoar in
their ſloop with their richeſt things;
at the ſame time Monſieur <hi>de Pouriere</hi>
man'd out his ſloop<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> after our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandant
had return'd back again, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
that any ſhould ſhare the firſt

advantage with him, which was very
Conſiderable, elſe the enemy had not
had time to go aſhoar, and ſave what
they did, and we had certainly taken
2 Women who cary'd off eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Caupants of gold, to the vallue
of above 10000 crowns in Pearls and
Jevvels.</p>
               <p>While theſe fled aſhoar, we made
a detatchment of ſix Gard Marins and
ſeveral Musketeers to arm the ſloop,
and the boat, in which Monſieur
<hi>Dauberville,</hi> our Lieutenant, was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to board the <hi>Dutch</hi> man; I
was choſen with one of my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marades
to accompany him, and the

directly to the Pink while the men
aboard her Smoaking their pipes veiw'd
us with little or no Concern, but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
or eight, more affirighted than the
reſt, cry'd out to the <hi>Negros,</hi> who
were not far off; to fetch them a ſhoar
in their Perogues, vvhich they did;
notwithſtanding all our threats; the
<hi>Dutch</hi> lept into it confuſedly, but our

at the firſt fire ſo ſcar'd them, that
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:56915:37"/>
they choſe to Row back again to their
ſhip, and there abide the utmoſt.</p>
               <p>We were within piſtol ſhot of the
ſhip, when we ſaw one of the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
buſy at one of the Guns, upon
which we in a manner gave our ſelves
for loſt, and Monſieur <hi>Duqueſne</hi> had
the ſame opinion of us; and had they
been men of any reſolution, nothing
had been eaſier than to have deſtroy'd
us, by levelling one gun at the boat,
and another at the ſloop.</p>
               <p>'Twas now ſome time ſince our

the leaſt reſiſtance, crying, <hi>Vive le

               </p>
               <p>One would ſcarce believe with what
earneſtneſs and violence the Seamen
pillage, when they enter a ſhip, break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
open trunks and boxes, and rifling
every thing, nay, they were ſo violent
in plundring theſe <hi>Dutchmen,</hi> that ſome
of them fell on the Captain, who was
ſmoaking quietly with his Lieutenant,
tearing the gold buttons out of the
neck and ſleeves of his ſhirt, and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:56915:37"/>
taking ſix Caupants of gold from
him, which is a ſort of long money
of <hi>Japan,</hi> of the value of ten crowns a
piece.</p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>D' Auberville</hi> having em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barqued
all the Spoil he received from
the Seamen that boarded her, ſent
back the Boat to our Commandant;
who landed ſome men in it, ſoon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to recover eight of thoſe Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Cheſts of Silver, which the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
had carried off in their ſloop. Our
men ſoon diſcover'd them, by a track
of <hi>Rix Dollars</hi> that were ſcatter'd on
the Sand, which lead them directly
to the place where the <hi>Dutchmen</hi> had
hid them; but our perſuit being vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
they they had not time enongh
to convey them to a Counter about
2 Leagues diſtant.</p>
               <p>Some of the Seamen got no leſs
than 3 or 400 Crowns in the plunder,
for their ſhare, and afterwards their
thoughts run on nothing elſe but more
prize and pillage. This was a new
Pink, of about 70 Tun, and came from
<hi>Batavia</hi> ballaſted with Rice, to load
Nutmegs and Cinnamon at <hi>Ceylon.</hi>
We fetcht her out of the road of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velle,</hi>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:56915:38"/>
and brought her to an anchor

and eat any thing that's of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd

them. The <hi>Parias</hi> are ſhoemakers,
and the moſt infamous of all, the
naſtieſt in their way of living, and
eat the bodies of dead creatures tho'
they died of ſickneſs, not ſparing the
rotton ſtinking gutts, and are very
vile and miſerable, but the <hi>Brames</hi> and
the <hi>Faquers</hi> are thoſe who are moſt
eſteem'd.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Brames</hi> are the Gentlemen, and
only they are permitted to wear ſilk
ſtrings in bandaliers, and three lines
on their faces, two white, and one
red in the midple; their heads are
ſhav'd, except a tufft which they leave
on the top, they wear Muſlin turbants,
and commonly ſhirts of the ſame, with
a delicate Callico, to touch which is a
crime that deſerves puniſhment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them.</p>
               <p>So that a <hi>French</hi> man one day ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly
touching one that belong'd to
a <hi>Brame,</hi> who was bathing himſelf,
they came to the Fort in crowds to
complain of him to Monſieur <hi>Martin,</hi>
and to demand him in order to have
juſtice done on him, they pretended
he was burnt, ſo they were obliged to
hide him, and after often remonſtrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:56915:49"/>
to them, that what he had done,
was out of ignorance not diſreſpect,
they were at laſt appeas'd; they eat
nothing that has life, neither fleſh nor
fiſh, nor ſo much as eggs, living on
rice, Milk, Roots, and the like. They
won't be ſo much as ſeen eating, and
are ſo jealous of their honor, that they
think it a great diſgrace to enter into
the houſe of a mean perſon.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Brames,</hi> as all the reſt, have
a great Veneration for cows, and will
not on any account ſuffer them to be
kild; being ſo uſeful to mankind by
their work and labour; and when our
men kill any, they are forc't to do it
in private, for fear of provoking theſe
<hi>Idolaters,</hi> who on the tenth of <hi>Jan.</hi>
the firſt day of their year, celebrate a
feaſt in honor of them.</p>
               <p>On theſe days after feaſting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
they lead all the cows and oxen
into a lake, where they waſh them by
the ſound of drums and the trumpets,
and paint their foreheads and horns;
after which they lead them to a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
place, and each holding a noſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gay

caſting water on them, and often
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:56915:49"/>
proſtrating themſelves on the Ground
the <hi>Brames</hi> direct theſe ceremonies;
and glory in being the moſt zealous
obſervers of theſe ſort of ſuperſtitions.
And are the inſtructors of others.</p>
               <p>The name of their Idol is <hi>Ram,</hi>
and when they ſalute any one with
reſpect, they call him by that name.
For they not only worſhip this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
Divinity, but the reſt of the
Statues, which they believe ſerve him;
they carry them about on ſollemn
days; ſome have eight and ſome four
heads on a body, ſiting on a bird,
that holds a ſerpent in his Beeck.</p>
               <p>Others ſquatting on their tails like
Monkies, have the head of an <hi>Elephant,</hi>
and belly of a woman; they pray to
them often, and are careful of waſhing
their heads with <hi>Coco</hi> water, and
rubing the reſt of their bodies with
oyl.</p>
               <p>If you inquire into the reaſon of
their ſenſleſs Superſtitions and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous

they received them from their Anceſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors,

doing pennance, and that little cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they weare is ſo wretchedly poor,
they vow chaſtity, and voluntary po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty,
and when Alms is denied them,
they wound themſelves, to move com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion.</p>
               <p>As for the firſt Vow of Chaſtity, they
have little pretence to it, and the very
opinion the people have of their ſanct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity,
is the occaſion of the moſt loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
obſcenities in the Female Sex.</p>
               <p>However theſe <hi>Faquirs</hi> impoſe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
on themſelves, which they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violably
obſerve as long as they live,
<hi>viz.</hi> as to have both their arms always
rais'd above their heads, one foot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
lifted up, and a great many
other painful poſtures, which they
continue in to their deaths. I ſaw one
with his head in an Iron cage, which
he carri'd night and day on his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
eating through the barrs; theſe
wretches, as well as others, paint their
bodies and faces of a great many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent

<hi>&amp;c.</hi> In an Eclipſe they meet by the
ſea ſide, crying out hideouſly to the
noiſe of ſome inſtruments of braſs,
bathing themſelves, and believing that
as they waſh themſelves, they clear

black lank breaſts, with nipples al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
as big as an Apple; they carry
their children on their hips, their legs
dangling on each ſide. I have ſeen of
them that were not above four months
old creeping on the ſand on all four,
and muddling like Ducks in the

them: Omitting nothing that might

prove advantagious for the attacque:
And thereupon he preſently ordered us
to turn that little veſſel we had taken
off of the Iſle of <hi>Ceylon</hi> into a Fire ſhip,
and to unring the <hi>Dutch</hi> Pink, which
after Monſieur <hi>Poureire</hi> had taken her

his own which was ſplit in the Action
at <hi>Amjouam,</hi> we left her naked at

carrying the Captain and

               <p>In about an hours ſpace, we ſaw <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jumelle,</hi>
a place ſituated by the ſea ſide,
the ſweeteſt on all the coaſt; the <hi>Dutch</hi>
having a Factory, hung out a flag

               <p>The wind blowing freſh in the

of coming to <hi>Madras</hi> in the night;
the paſſage from <hi>Ponticheri</hi> thither,
not being above 20 Leagues: ſo ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
gently the reſt of the night, we
diſcover'd a ſhip a head of us, which

us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:56915:55"/>
So we preſently brought down our

in leſs than half an hour we were fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for the fight, which we the more
eagerly deſir'd, becauſe it was St.

               <p>And now we perceived the ſhips,
which ſeem'd to us to be rang'd in a

<hi>George;</hi> which is a ſtrong and noble

had Maſs ſaid betimes, then took a

and the round tops with Flower deluce't

to execute them.</p>
               <p>Never men more heartily deſir'd to
come to action than ours, and we had
reaſon to expect an anſwerable ſucceſ,
and by the manner of our falling on,
our thoughts ran more on a certain
Victory, than an uncertain fight. The

within ſhot of the Fort, which began
to fire upon them; yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they paſt by with little or no

came and anchor'd over againſt the
ſhips they intended, and fir'd furiouſly
upon them. It might now be about
One in the afternoon, and we followed
them ſo cloſe, that the enemy had
ſcarce anſwer'd them again, when we
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:56915:56"/>
came up with the <hi>Dutch</hi> Admiral, and
gave her a broad ſide.</p>
               <p>'Tis not very common to ſee ſix
ſuch ſhips as ours attack eleven large
ones, and to bear all their fire, and that
of a ſtrong fort too; the leaſt of
whoſe guns were twenty four and
thirty ſix pounders, and indeed the
fire was ſo terrible of both ſides, that
nothing was to be ſeen but fire, ſmoak
and ball.</p>
               <p>'Twas then that Monſieur <hi>d' Auber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi>
diſdaining danger, in the midſt of
that ſhower of Ball, attempted to fire
the <hi>Dutch</hi> Admiral; who ſeeing a fire

ſhew'd great courage and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct

which return'd ſafe to his ſhip, in
ſpight of all the fire of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>
               <p>All expected that this undertaking

were of that opinion, for they

               <p>Next morning we ſaw the ſhips
lying nearer the Fort, and rang'd in a
better line then they were before.
We then perceiv'd our overſight in
not boarding them to rights at firſt,
by the much greater difficulty of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacking
them a ſecond time; they had
now plac't themſelves at ſuch a diſtance

fire at us, without hurting them; a

               <p>Conſidering the difficulty of a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

that we might give them time to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,
if they thought they could make
any thing of it, but there appear'd
not the leaſt diſpoſition in them; on

Monſieur <hi>Duqueſne</hi> ſent Monſieur <hi>de la

               <p>This little Squadron of arm'd ſloops,
as is neceſſary on ſuch an Expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
quickly reacht the place, where
that change of waters is obſerv'd,
which is caus'd in the ſea by the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:56915:60"/>
to ſound; by reaſon of a vaſt number
of little rocks that lay under water
here abouts, beyond which this ſhip
had run her ſelf aground; we went
two fathom and a half water, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being able to come near her; ſo
that we could not immagin, how 'twas
poſſible for the Veſſel to get ſo far

               <p>About a quarter of an hour after,
we ſaw a topmaſt floating on the ſide

who by ſigns, of Croſſes, deſir'd us

going towards them took them
up in his boat, where they no ſooner
were, but the ſeamen fell a rifling
theſe miſerable people, for the money

who inform'd us, that 'twas an <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
ſhip of 36 guns coming from <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilipatam,</hi>
that from the time ſhe was
run aground, the Captain debarkt with

20000 crowns <hi>French,</hi> and her richeſt
lading that could be beſt carried
off: That the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who were but

fifteen, ſav'd themſelves a ſhoar,

on the deck; adding alſo, that they

them farther out to Sea.</p>
               <p>We ſaw her ſtruck at one end, and
ſo we judg'd, there could not be above
three foot water where ſhe was; the
vaſt ſurges that roll all along on this

               <p>About three days before, and I

remov'd the powder out of the <hi>Lyons</hi>

conſum'd a great deal of it, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd

               <p>At length the wind chang'd, and
continued good for five or ſix days,

came within ſhot of her, who hung
out a flag all red; we hung out ours,
which they ſaluted by hoiſting their

Monſieur <hi>Duqueſne</hi> ſent his ſloop to
bring the Captain aboard, who ſhew'd
him a Paſs-port ſign'd by Monſieur
<hi>Martin;</hi> he was accompanied by three
old men like himſelf, clad in <hi>Muſlin</hi>

<hi>Mooriſh</hi> Merchants, bound from <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilipatam</hi>

that 'twould have carried us too far

had; it never was ſo changeable, for
if it favour'd us for a day, 'twas a

where we loaded fifty tun of water
and wood, tho' not without great toil,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:56915:68"/>
by reaſon of the landing, which is
very troubleſom at low water. The

by reaſon of the vaſt number of ſmall
Rocks that inviron this Iſle.</p>
               <p>They who admire ſhell-work, may
glut their fancy here; for the ſtrand
is cover'd or'e with the moſt beautiful
ſhells that can be ſeen. The Iſland
produces no pallatable fruit but <hi>Cocos,</hi>
the vaſt plenty of which was very
benificial to me, and ſome others,
whoſe curioſity had oblig'd us to lie
in a part of the Iſland where there is
no ſweet Water to be had; we kindled
a great fire, and paſt the whole night

more troubleſom and pernicious, they
appearing only in the night.</p>
               <p>Every one will juſtly wonder, that

and drink, yet ſuch is the <hi>Coco;</hi> the
tree is lofty, Crooked at the Foot
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:56915:68"/>
like the <hi>Pinetree,</hi> its branches are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd
at top; the fruit is commonly
as big as ones head, the bark being
ſo exceeding thick, you cannot find the
<hi>Coco</hi> till you have ſtript it, at the end
there's a hole, which you no ſooner
touch with your knife but there ſpurts
out a clear water, very ſweet, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing;
they are of a ſmall ſize in
this Iſland, but I remember at <hi>Moelly</hi>
they were ſo large, that three of us
could ſcarſe deal with one of them:
You muſt ſplit the <hi>Coco</hi> to get at the
Kernell, which is white and about the
thickneſs of your finger, and taſtes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
like a haſel-nut; of all fruits this
is perhaps the moſt uſeful; the <hi>Indians</hi>
beſides meat and drink, draw a certain
oyl from it, into which the Water
turns after it has ſtood ſometime;
they make bowls, and cups, of the ſhells
and ropes, and Tow of the bark, to
bind and caulk their boats with.</p>
               <p>This Iſland is nothing near ſo ſteep
as others I have ſeen, but then 'ts ſo
wooded with high trees, that it is
one impenetrable foreſt all over; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:56915:69"/>
6 foot long, and as thick as a Mans
leg; whoſe deep mouths were ſet with
teeth as dangerous, as their claws are
with talons, however they fled at the
ſight of us, and do no harm if not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tackt;
their fleſh is wonderful white,
and ſome of our men eat of it, and
found it good.</p>
               <p>It is ſtock'd with different ſorts of
Inſects; amongſt the reſt there's one
very little Annimal which ſeems to be
all legs, very remarkable by their
various colours, and a pretty ſhell
on their backs. There's another
creature of the ſhape of a ſerpent,
which I have often heard cry diſtinctly
in the trees; <hi>Tocquets,</hi> ſo being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant

much leſs for the habitations of men,
for I believe it never was inhabited.
'Tis true, that in the Eaſtern part of

Wild Oxen, Staggs, and Wild-Boars,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:56915:74"/>
which live there undiſturb'd in the
midſt of the greateſt plenty; no other
Iſland is ſo ſtor'd with game, or has
better hunting; beſides the beaſts I
have nam'd, which are ſeen in vaſt
droves; there's plenty of Ring-doves,
Wood-cocks, Teal, Parrots, and an
endleſs number of ſtrange birds of
divers kinds.</p>
               <p>The are Swans, Lizards, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents
of a great length, and a great
number of <hi>Crocodils,</hi> call'd <hi>Caymans,</hi>
who in the day time hide themſelves
in rivers, the better to ſurprize the
beaſts when they come to drink;
this ſubtile creature faſtning on the
noſe of the Wild Oxen, draws them
in, and after drownding them eats
them.</p>
               <p>At the little Iſland where we took
in Water and Wood, are ſeen two
ſpacious and beautiful plains, cover'd
with good feeding, in which the ſight
loſes it ſelf: Through the midſt of it,
a pleaſant river takes its Courſe; whoſe
Water is exceeding good, and eaſiy
to be come at; there we bath'd our
ſelves almoſt every hour in the day,
under the thick ſhady trees, and in
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:56915:74"/>
large and greedy draughts, quencht
the violence of our raging thirſt.</p>
               <p>All this place is marſhy, and in
many places with ſalt water; yet in
the woods there are places where they
don't reach, and where there is ſweet
water always to be found; which the
beaſts drink of, who come thither in
troops of a hunderd at a time, and
feed quietly together; without fear of
being diſturb'd by the Huntſman.</p>
               <p>One of my companions and I go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a hunting, we follow'd ſome
Harts and Hinds very warmly, which
carried us further into the wood than
we were aware of; ſo that after two
hours purſuit, being quite tir'd, and
intending to return back again, 'twas
more than we could do, to find our
way, tho' we ſtill flattered our ſelves
with hopes; but after long trying in
vain, we at laſt began to deſpair, and
almoſt to give our ſelves for loſt; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
already over-power'd with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
thirſt and wearineſs.</p>
               <p>We paſt through a great many
Thickets, the paths being only beaten
by the wild beaſts; the ſight of whom
diverted our melancholy wanderings
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:56915:75"/>
in a deſart Iſland, deſtitute of all Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance;
expos'd to Tygers, Wild-Oxen
and Serpents; in this ſad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
knowing not what to do, we
adreſt our ſelves to God; and took
obſervations of the Sun; Steering our
courſe by it. So after much labour
and fatigue, and beating about from
four in the morning to 4 in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
we at length diſcover'd the plain
in which our Companions were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp'd;
from whence we went to our
tent, rejoycing that we were not
oblieg'd to lie in the woods, that
night.</p>
               <p>Theſe two Iſles differ but little, ſave

a great many <hi>Tygers,</hi> and greater

theſe wild Inhabitants, that the

kill'd; became ſo furious, that the

               <p>A Captain of the <hi>Marines</hi> belonging

that inſtead of ſhooting at her, they
fled and left him expos'd to her fury;
but however they went back after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
and took him up half dead,
bringing him to the Tent; whom we

               <p>However a report attended with

having taken about fourſcore <hi>Tortoiſes,</hi>
we ſail'd for <hi>Balazor.</hi> That day a

enrag'd, becauſe he could not revenge
himſelf for ſome hard uſage he thought

at the great Iſle of <hi>Negraille;</hi>
whither we had ſent the ſloop in the

been a hunting ſince the day before;
without taking any other proviſion,
but a little <hi>Rack</hi> and ſome <hi>Biſcuit</hi> in

               <p>Scarce had we loſt ſight of <hi>Negraile,</hi>
but the little wind we had, turn'd into
a downright calm; which laſted a long
while, and was very Tireſom by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the violent heats, and a malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
Fever that began to ſpread
amongſt the Seamen; which we with
reaſnn attributed to the extraordinary

to the peſtilential ſerenes of theſe
Marſhy Iſlands, which are damp, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholeſome
Vapors riſing after Sun-ſet;
and the whole Crew, that before en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd

much infected; ſo that Monſieur
<hi>Duqueſne</hi> through a neceſſity of being
ſupply'd with freſh proviſions was
oblieg'd to ſtop at <hi>Cheduba,</hi> an Iſland
in the Kingdom of <hi>Racam,</hi> ſituated in
18 Deg. 23 Min. N. L. and 115 D.
34 M. L. where we ſay for a while,
and ſent three ſloops aſhoar.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as ever theſe fearful
Iſlanders perceiv'd them, they fled to
the woods; there came a band of them
afterwards to the ſea ſide with <hi>Lances</hi>
and <hi>Bows</hi> in their hands, making ſigns
that we ſhould not Land; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
which two of our men did,
(and put them out of pain,) by letting
them underſtand as well as they could
the reaſon of it; but 'twas impoſſible
to perſwade theſe ſavages to ſupply
us with any freſh proviſions for our
mony, or by the way of exchange,
tho' they had plenty of Fowl and Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:56915:78"/>
They are of a ſwarthy complection,
and go naked; have very thick hair,
and are taller than ordinary. 'Twas
no ſmall mortification to fail of being
ſupplied with thoſe Proviſions and
neceſſaries we expected to meet with
here; our diſtemper encreaſing daily,
and having ſcarce freſh proviſions
enough to ſerve the ſick, the number
of whom by this time amounted to
60, and 'twas not long before I was
one of them, but was ſo happy as to
have but ſix fits of the Fever.</p>

but inconſiderable, when divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
fourſcore ſick perſons, who
yet were glad of it till they got to
<hi>Balazor,</hi> to the ſight of which we came
the laſt of <hi>November</hi> in the morning;
we ſail'd four days along the coaſt, and
the banks of the <hi>Ganges,</hi> which is
one of the four principal Rivers of the
World; and on the third of <hi>December,</hi>
we came to an anchor within three
Leagues and a half of the Land, where
after firing three guns of notice, as the

had the diſeaſe of the Country, and to

of the ſick; the number of whom was
too great to let the <hi>Engliſh</hi> know of it,
who had a Factory too at <hi>Balazor,</hi>
and might make their advantages of it.</p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>Deſlandes,</hi> Director gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral,

with two others, that the <hi>French</hi> took
from the <hi>Siamois,</hi> which were partly
laden with Salt-peter, and ſome bales
of goods, that were to be put aboard

of hand, and ſeveral other great Barks,
who every day brought us the reſt
of the goods; while we were loading,
Monſieur <hi>Deſlandes</hi> continued a board
us, whom the Commandant entertain'd
very nobly, and honour'd him ſeveral
times with the diſcharge of guns, as well
from his own ſhip, as the reſt, who
complimented him thus in their Turns.</p>
               <p>We were very ill furniſht with freſh
proviſions here; the beef and mutton
was meer carrion, ſo that two of the
Captains who were careful of the
health of their men, threw, what fell to
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:56915:79"/>
their ſhare over-board; I never ſaw
any fleſh ſo red, or ſo likely to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
a flux; however our Captain
who did not much concern himſelf
with ſuch things, and the violence of
hunger, made us digeſt them with
rice, which was now our bread for four
months.</p>
               <p>This fare was none of the beſt, and
I long'd to go to <hi>Balazor</hi> to mend
my diet, but could not get leave,
by reaſon that at our firſt landing
there were ſome of the Seamen who
got drunk with <hi>Aquavitae,</hi> and quarrell'd
with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> one of vvhom they
kill'd with a knife, which was the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion

ſuch kind of quarrels.</p>

again; and on the tenth in the evening,
we diſcover'd the land of <hi>Madras;</hi> at
which the Commandant lay by, for
fear of paſſing beyond it in the night,
reſolving to ſtop there the next day, if
he diſcover'd any ſhiping, tho' the
fright and conſternation the enemy was
in, gave us little ground to expect it;
yet nevertheleſs we met one, whom
the fort had no ſooner warn'd of our
arrival by ſix guns, but ſhe fled; not
believing it a ſufficient protection.</p>
               <p>We follow'd her with all the ſail
we could make, and at laſt came up
with her, notwithſtanding ſhe had
been ſo far a head of us; about four
in the afternoon ſeeing the <hi>Lyon</hi> and
the <hi>Dragon</hi> within ſhot of her, ſhe run
herſelf within a little bank at <hi>Sadraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patam,</hi>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:56915:81"/>
where her men preſently went
a ſhoar. But in vain had ſhe ſought
for ſafety there, if the ſea, which was
very ruff, had not hinder'd us from
boarding her; yet we earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier'd
it, being ready to run any
riskque in the pillageing and burning
of her, but Monſieur <hi>Duqueſne</hi> judging
otherwiſe of it, purſued his Voyage,
and this evening came to an anchor
ſome Leagues beyond <hi>Madras,</hi> from
whence we departed next morning
being the twelfth, and arriv'd at <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichery</hi>
at one in the afternoon; the
Fort ſaluted us with nine Guns, and
we anſwer'd them with as many:
Father <hi>Tachand</hi> went a ſhoar pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently,
taking with him what he had
aboard, intending to make his reſidence
there.</p>
               <p>I could not immagine that the loſs
of his Reverence, could produce ſuch
different effects as it did; there were
ſome who were very much afflicted at
it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and a great many others, who of
the contrary were very little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd:
and moſt of the Seamen, who
are little verſt in the merits, and worth
of Men, were as incenſible of the loſs
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:56915:82"/>
of him, as if they had never enjoy'd
the advantages of his company; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he wanted not the civility of
ſeven Guns at his departure.</p>
               <p>The Publick is like to be oblieg'd
to him for an account of his Voyage,
which at parting he put into the hands
of Monſieur <hi>Duqueſne,</hi> to deliver it to the
RR. FF. Jeſuites, who were to ſee it
printed, but it contains no return; I
read nothing in it which I had not
ſeen, and which I have not inſerted in
this; except a letter from one of their
Fathers, who is at preſent in <hi>China;</hi>
which contains a full account of the
Revolution that happen'd at <hi>Siam,</hi>
and this has very much enlarg'd his
Relation.</p>
               <p>Since our departure from <hi>Pontichery,</hi>
they had planted on the ſhoar a new
battery of eight Guns, 18 pounder
each, being thoſe we had brought
from <hi>France;</hi> and we found above
twenty thouſand <hi>Negros</hi> there, who
had fled thither for refuge, under the
<hi>French Pavillion,</hi> to avoid the Troops
of the <hi>Great Mogul;</hi> who had beſieg'd
<hi>Gingy,</hi> the Caputal of the Prince of
that Name.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:56915:82"/>
This is a very great Town, about
fifteen Leagues up the land; the
ſtrongeſt, and the only one, able to
reſiſt the power of the <hi>Mogul;</hi> with
whom this Prince has continual war:
And whoſe Troops, tho' to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of fourſcore thouſand, where, as
they told us, ſhamefully oblieg'd to
quit the Siege, through the vigorus
reſiſtance of the Gariſon and the Town,
where the Prince of <hi>Gingy</hi> commanded
in perſon.</p>
               <p>Two great Lords of the Country
who where at <hi>Pontichery</hi> when we lay
at anchor, had the curioſity to come
and ſee our ſhip, accompanied with
five and twenty ſervants, which they
took out of above three hundred, that
each of them had; we put all things
in as good order as we could, and
brought all our Company above Deck,
the number of which they admir'd at;
but the Sea incommoding them very
much, and not being able to ſtand on
the deck, they returned immediately;
with a ſalute of 7 Guns and 7 <hi>vive le
Roy's.</hi>

which was more irkſom to us, than any

               <p>The Wind already blew ſo ſtrong,
that we ſail'd no leſs than 3 Leagues
an hour; and encreaſing on <hi>Tueſday</hi>
the <hi>1ſt.</hi> of March, obleig'd us to furl
all our Sails, except the fore-maſt; and
the air was ſo thick and Cloudy, that
we cou'd ſcarce deſcern from Ship to
Ship, which prov'd but too Fatal an
Omen, of that dreadful Tempeſt that
enſu'd. Sure nothing cou'd be more
Frightful and amazing, than to ſee
the air condens'd, and our beloved
Element repreſenting a diſmal ſcene of
Death. The Winds ſpent their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
rage, and ſeem'd to groan be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
their Burthen; while the yawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſeas torn with their fury, eagerly
deſir'd to make a prey of us: Yet
ſtill kept us in ſuſpenſe, even in the
Arms of Death; about Four in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon,
the foremaſt ſheet was blown
to rags, and the vaſt noiſe and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal

rouling of the ſhip, fill'd us all
with confuſion and horror.</p>
               <p>And now being about 3000 Leagues
from Land, we ſaw ourſelves expoſed
to the outragious Element; without
ſails, and diſtitute of all means that
might tend to our ſafty. The vaſt
prodigious waves no ſooner rowl'd
over our Decks, and fill'd our ſhip
with water, but greater ſtill return'd,
and ſeem'd to ſink us to the Bottom;
ſo that ſometimes we had ſcarce
time to take breath, and hardly knew
whether we were in the ſhip or the
ſea.</p>
               <p>In this miſerable condition and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
danger, every one plied
the pump; and the ſhort remainder
of the day, we ſpent in faſtening a
ſprit ſail to the yard of the fore-maſt ſail,
which we had no ſooner done, but as
an addition to our miſery, a diſmal
ſhout was heard at the ſight of one
of our ſhips, which driven by the
violence of the Storm, was juſt
ready to run fowl of us, and ſplit us
both.</p>
               <p>All that's horrible and amazing in
death; preſented it ſelf to our view;
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:56915:85"/>
himſelf at the laſt moment of life,
knew not what courſe to take, or
what he ſhould do to avoid it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we
unfurl'd our two ſprit-ſails, which
were no ſooner looſe, but the winds
blew them into a thouſand Shatters
however they ſerv'd to Clear us of
the ſhip to which we ſo happily
ſhew'd our lights<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that hoiſting her
foremaſt ſail ſhe paſt by, without
damage on either ſide.</p>
               <p>In the midſt of ſo many alarums and
continual dangers, we paſt the reſt of
night in pumping, and rummaging
the inſide of the ſhip, which was ſo
wet that there was not a dry place to
be found in't to lie down: Rivers of
Water ran continually over the deck;
the Boxes, cheſts, and all the hamocks
were thrown down, and nothing was
to be ſeen throughout the whole Veſſel
but the perfect picture of a ſhipwrack,
to which the winds and Seas ſeem'd
to conſpire; this night we had the
the <hi>Jack Staff</hi> carried away by one
ſingle Wave.</p>
               <p>We waited for day Break with more
impatience than our Friends for our
Return<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as tho' 'twould alay the ſtorm,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:56915:86"/>
or reſcue us from danger; at laſt it
came, but alas it only ſerv'd to give
us a clearer ſight of our Miſery, ſo
that <hi>Friday</hi> in the morning, the wind
and the ſeas having abated nothing of
their rage, but ſtill encreaſing; and
finding our ſelves quite ſpent, we
with horror beheld the Wild and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
inevitable death that waited for
us.</p>
               <p>We had recourſe to GOD as the
only means left, and with tears in
our Eyes, and terror in our Hearts,
we implor'd his Infinite Goodneſs,
by the ſuffrages of the Bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
and St. <hi>Joſeph;</hi> whom we pray'd
to interpoſe their credit to obtain
mercy for us. In the mean time
we ply'd four pumps continually,
and having diſcover'd two great Leaks,
the one afore, the other aff't we were
oblieg'd to make a well in the bottom
of the keel, and to draw the water
thence with Buckets and Pails to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
ſinking.</p>
               <p>'Twas ſtrange, that tho' watching
and faſting had quite ſpent us; yet
we ſhou'd gather ſtrength out of our
very weakneſs, and work and toil on,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:56915:86"/>
without ſo much as reflecting on our
miſerable condition; each of us thought
of nothing but diſputing his life, which
he ſaw preſt and attackt with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
dangers at once.</p>
               <p>We continued thus toyling in our
Miſery, till four in the evening, when
not knowing what farther courſe to
take to ſave our ſelves, or to reſiſt the
violence of the ſtorm, we a ſecond time
adreſt our ſelves to GOD, vowing
upon a deliverance to have a Service,
or each his particular Maſs ſaid at
St. <hi>Anns</hi> in <hi>Auray.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We crept up upon the Deck, and
our <hi>Almoner</hi> on his knees, under
the quarter deck, as did all the reſt
invok the aid and mercy of Heaven,
in the name of two hundred and fifty
Saints more, who poured out their
Souls in the ſame devotion, implor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the mercy of GOD; never was a
more moving Spectacle ſeen, and I
then with horror read our ruin in the
diſparing looks of Monſieur <hi>Duqueſne,</hi>
who kneeling on his bed, and looking
fixedly on the raging Seas, mounting
high in the air, and threatning us
with ruin, ſeem'd to tell us there was
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:56915:87"/>
no more hopes left but in the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
Favour of Heaven: The Vow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
made, he let himſelf fall on his
bed, ſaying his only hopes were in
the Infinite mercy of GOD, and that
'twas invain to ſtrive any longer.</p>
               <p>This, I own threw me into the laſt
deſpair, yet we were reſolv'd to try
once more what we could do; reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to ſave our ſelves, or periſh; we
try'd to hoiſt a ſecond time our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſt
ſail, where we us'd care in tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the riſe; each with fear and
impatience waited the ſucceſs of a
courſe, that was either to ſave or ruin
us; and at this very time we were
quite conſum'd with the labour of the
mercileſs Sea.</p>
               <p>A little after a Seaman, whom the
Sea had ſwept out of the ſhip, was
thrown in again by the Waves, and
ſav'd.</p>
               <p>But GOD at laſt ſhow'd us mercy,
and pitty, and was pleas'd to put an
end to all our Fatigues and ſufferings;
for unfurling the foremaſt ſail, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
the wind; when full of joy and
acknowledgement for ſo viſible a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
we began to purſue our way;
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:56915:87"/>
and in our turn, triumphing over
thoſe Waves that had ſo inſulted us
for two days together.</p>
               <p>We ran thus the reſt of the night,
and next day, being <hi>Saturday,</hi> the
wind began to alter about four in the
morning; ſo that at break of day we ſaw
our ſelves out of that danger, which
continually threatned us for eight and
forty hours together, without ſleeping,
or eating, or drinking, ſave a little
Biſcuit and Rack.</p>
               <p>When we had ſtopt the two leakes
as well as we could, we fell to ſettling
all things in the inſide of the ſhip,
that were in confuſion; for nothing
cou'd be ſeen but Cheſts and Arms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
ſcatter'd up and down; fowls and
beaſts drown'd; in ſhort, an Emblem
of an univerſal Deluge: each now
taking breath, began to provide for
himſelf, ſome preſt with hunger, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to ſearch for Victuals; but the
kitchins being ſpoiled we could have
none dreſt in three days time; and
others almoſt dead for want of ſleep,
fell to drying their beds and cloaths
in the Sun.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:56915:88"/>
Never was the returning ſpring,
after a long and Torrid winter, more
greatful than the ſight of the Sun to us,
which compos'd the remainder of the
ſtorm, and huſh't it quite aſleep:
This was a truly happy day to us;
but ſeeing our ſelves all alone, we
reckon'd we were preſerv'd by Heaven,
only to carry home the diſmal news of
the loſs of the reſt of the Squadron; we
ſail'd on, ſtill continuing our way,
and endeavouring to diſcover what
was become of the reſt of the ſhips,

<hi>Dragon</hi> having found ground, hoiſted
a Flag to give us notice of it, we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
huddled over a few pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
according to cuſtom, and ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all along we found ground in a 100
fathom Water.</p>
               <p>It was wonderful ſtrange that in this
place, where the Sea is always ſo boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous
and violent, it prov'd a dead
Calm, followed by ſo gentle a Breeze,
that we paſt this <hi>Bank</hi> of 24 Leagues
in length, with our Top-gallant Sails
only: Thus having doubled the <hi>Cape</hi>
of <hi>Good Hope</hi> we took heart, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
for a proſperous Voyage hence
forward, the Winds being now ſo
favourable.</p>
               <p>And indeed we made great way, for
after having ſailed 200 Leagues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
it, we began to breath in a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
Air, and to have fair and clear
Weather, conſtantly accompanied with
the gentle <hi>Trading Winds;</hi> it ſeem'd
as if God was now pleaſed to give
us a little comfort, after ſo much mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery
and Sufferings; and, to ſay truth,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:56915:91"/>
we extreamly ſtood in need of it, for
the Veſſel was not able to bear any
more weather; our Men were very
ſickly, and grew ſo more and more,
with what they had ſuffered in doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the Cape; ſo that every day ſome
of 'em died, either of the Flux, or of
the <hi>Scurvey.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet ſtill we had reaſon to believe
our ſelves happy, the Cold abating by
degrees, and warm weather ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which was no ſmall relief to thoſe
who were ill of the latter Diſtemper;
the Sea was now no longer dangerous,
but on the contrary all was calm and
pleaſant, as if we had made an In-land
Voyage.</p>

               <p>This monſtrous Creature is between
15 and 16 foot long, and almoſt as
big as a Man, it has no ſhell, but a
skin thick and rough like Shagrin,
with a Muzzle half round, diſtinct
from the reſt of the head; four fingers
below, towards the Belly is plac'd the
larger mouth, whoſe two Jaw bones
have each three rows of Teeth, which
are large and flat, yet very ſharp, ſo
that whenever he eats he is forc'd to
throw himſelf on his back.</p>
               <p>It ſeems as if Nature, wonderful in
her productions, wou'd by that means
ſuppreſs the devouring Appetite of this
greedy Creature, which I have ſeen re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
three times to the ſame Bait, tho'
the hook had torn his Gills before.</p>
               <p>This Monſtrous creature does not
ſhun Men, as other fiſh do, for he no
ſooner ſees him in the water, but he
follows him, and when he deſigns to
quit the prey, he throws himſelf
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:56915:92"/>
upon it, carrying away that part on
which he faſtens firſt; he is never
ſeen but in a calm, following ſhips to
catch whatever meat or rubbiſh the
Seamen throw out.</p>
               <p>Certain little Fiſhes of the ſize of
a <hi>Sardine</hi> which Swims before, (free
from the inſults of this creature as
devouring as it is) and ſerve him
as a Pilot, for from thence it is they
are called by that name; they are
ſuch faithful companions to him, that
when he is taken with the hook, and
drawing in, they lie on his back,
and ſuffer themſelves to be drawn in
alſo.</p>
               <p>I had forgot to mention how we
found in the belly of one we took, a
Knife and ſix pound of Bacon, which
in all probability it got at the hook;
I believe there is no creature in the
World ſo hard liv'd, and difficult to
kill.</p>
               <p>I took notice of one thing, among
ſeveral others on board our Ship,
that was peculiarly amazing in this
fiſh; which was this, that it being
cut in peices, and each peice, ſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from the heart, yet they all
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:56915:92"/>
mov'd alike, which ſurprized us very

               <p>This fiſh has a ſort of marrow in

               <p>We never had more need of going
a ſhoar, for our Company was harraſt
and quite ſpent with our poor diet, and
continual pumping night and day; for
our refuge was nothing but a little
Brandy at our meals, with Biſcuit and
ſtinking fleſh, and this was but a ſmall

conſum'd with the Bloody Flux, a third

ſorts of Birds, Inhabitants of

it were, to meet and receive us; they
crouded ſo thick about us, that we
killed them with half-pikes. Here
we anchored in 30 fathom water, over

the Tortoiſes go aſhoar, which is at

               <p>AS ſoon as we had caſt Anchor,
the Seamen began to fiſh, and
catch vaſt numbers; next day I went
aſhoar, although it was very difficult
landing, the Sloop being obliged to
ſet us aſhoar on a ſteep rock, where
we were forced to creep on all four,
with a great deal of trouble and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
ſeveral of our ſick that were
landed here, died preſently, not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſtrength enough to bear the Air,
and the difficulties of climbing the
Cliffs.</p>
               <p>There is no Water found in this
uninhabited Iſland, nor any thing to
be ſeen but parch'd barren Hills, and
Vales without verdure; nay, not ſo
much as a blade of Graſs, or any
Herb; ſo violent and piercing are the
Rays of the Sun. It's ſituated in 7 d.
30 m. of S. L. and may be about
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:56915:96"/>
five leagues in compaſs. At firſt it
appeared full of Mountains and Crag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
Rocks, cover'd with Birds dung,
who make their Neſts on the top of
them; but in the Weſt of the Iſland,
two high Mountains riſe, which are a
little green, being better moiſtned by
the frequent Dews, which cauſes the
ground all about, to abound with the
largeſt, and beſt taſted Purſloine that
ever I met with.</p>
               <p>As weak as I was, the deſire I had
to be cured of the Scurvy, in taking
the Air at Land, which is the only
remedy for this evil, made me run
up and down this part of the Iſland;
where I obſerv'd one thing that was
very extraordinary: The Birds which
ſtood thick on the Rocks, ſuffered us
to come ſo near them, that we might
take them with our hands, and I
ſtooping to gather ſome Purſloine,
ſeveral hovering round my head,
came and pearcht on my Hat, of
which I took four alive, and kill'd
two more with my Cane.</p>
               <p>The great numbers of theſe Birds,
deſtroy the young Tortoiſes as ſoon
as hatch'd, for they love their fleſh ſo
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:56915:96"/>
well, that they are continually pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing
them; and before they leave the
Egg, or are able to gain the Sea, or
ſwim on the ſurface of the Water;
they kill them with their Beaks; but
after they are grown bigger, the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of their ſhell makes them ſwim
with more ſtrength, and defends them
from theſe Birds of Prey. Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
this vaſt deſtruction of
them, their number is immenſe; the
Tortoiſe being one of thoſe Creatures,
that multiply moſt. Nor will they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
at it, who conſider it as one of
the largeſt fiſh, that has its Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from this Element.</p>
               <p>Its ſhape and colour being known
by moſt people, I thought it unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to give you a particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
of it here; I ſhall only ſay,
that its head reſembles that of an
Eagle, and the Fins, which are about
a foot and half long, are hid under
their Shells: And for that reaſon,
when the <hi>Requiems</hi> (a fiſh I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
before) meet with the Tortoiſes,
they always ſeize upon that part firſt,
and ſo kill them; their Shell being
but thin, and uncapable of reſiſting
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:56915:97"/>
ſo great a ſtrength, as that of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiem:</hi>
This Battle I have often ſeen
my ſelf, and ſo can the better atteſt
the truth of it.</p>
               <p>Some who have been ill inform'd,
have ſaid, that they make uſe of their
Paws in fighting, as the Land Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toiſes
do; but nothing is more falſe
than this, they having nothing like
a Paw, only a few Prickles at the end
of their Fins, which they Crawl aſhoar
with, and dig holes in the ground to
lay their Eggs in; which having done,
they immediately return to Sea again,
leaving them covered, to be hatch'd
by the warmth of the Sun.</p>
               <p>Great care and diligence muſt be
uſed in the taking of them, for they
are very quick-ſighted, you muſt
range your ſelf in the night, in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
places of the Creek, where they
are known to come aſhoar, and when
you perceive them at a ſufficient di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
from the Water, run to 'em and
throw 'em on their backs, and then
'tis impoſſible for 'em to riſe again.</p>
               <p>The Tortoiſes that are taken at the
Iſle of <hi>Aſcention,</hi> are the biggeſt that
ever I ſaw; there are ſome that weigh
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:56915:97"/>
three or four hundred weight, ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to feed ſo many men at a time;
the fleſh is very wholſom and delicate,
and the Eggs, which are exactly round,
and are found in great quantities a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
the coaſt, are almoſt as big as an
Hen's, but their ſhells are ſo thick, that
if you throw them againſt the ground,
they will rebound without breaking.</p>

               <p>This Iſland is ſo well known in <hi>France,</hi>
by the relations that have been made of it,
and the Trade it maintains there, that I
ought not to ſpeak much of it, except
ſome ſmall matters I obſerv'd in the ſhort
ſtay I made there; but that which pleas'd
me moſt was, the many fine Houſes ſcitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
on the Mountains all about, whoſe
Avenues, Allies and Arbours are compos'd
of Jeſſamins, Orange and Lemon Trees,
which are as common there, as Apple trees
in <hi>Normandy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Women there wou'd be very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable,
but for the pale colour which
is contracted by the Air of the Iſland,
where the heats in my mind are too great
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:56915:100"/>
for any, but the Natives to live, happily
there.</p>
               <p>Not being to make any long ſtay there,
we began to Wood and Water, after we
had clean'd our Ship and ſtopt the two
leaks we had. At this time the <hi>Rock,</hi> whom
we had not yet ſeen, came from an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent
harbour where ſhe had lain three
days at Anchor before our arrival, and
came to an anchor over againſt the Fort of
St. <hi>Peter,</hi> driven by the Wind and Tide;
ſhe rang'd our ſide ſo cloſe, that intending
to paſs betwixt us and the <hi>Flouriſhing,</hi> ſhe
ſtruck againſt our head and broke the
<hi>Beak,</hi> which ſo provoked Monſieur <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſne,</hi>
that he reſolv'd to have the head
<hi>Pilot</hi> drawn under the keel, but he was
diſcharg'd after three days lying in

ſuccesfully the reſt of the month, and
during thoſe few we met with very rough
Seas, fomented by violent Storms; but the

eaſy, though we had reaſon enough to be
otherwiſe; ſo nothing diſturb'd us after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,

               <p>The <hi>9th.</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi> the <hi>Rock</hi> hung out

in Quality of Director-General
of the Royal <hi>African</hi> Company; when
I immediately reſolv'd to accompany
him, and he conſented to it: and having
agreed on Terms, the 14. of <hi>Jan.</hi> 1682.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56915:108"/>
he preſented me to the Gentlemen of
the Company who confirm'd what we
had ſettled.</p>
            <p>After imploying a few days in ſettling
my Affairs, and in taking leave of my
Friends, we parted for <hi>Orleans;</hi> where
we took boat for <hi>Nantes</hi> on the <hi>Loire:</hi>
and tho' this Paſſage is commonly made
in two or three days, yet we were ſeven
or eight about it, and that not without
Danger too.</p>
            <p>The Wind was ſtill contrary, and ſo
violent, that the River was almoſt as
boiſterous as the Sea; the Rivers too
overflow'd ſo, that we loſt the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel;
ſo that only diſcerning the tops of
little Trees, all the reſt being under Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
we found our ſelves ſometimes faſt on
the Trunks, like Birds perching on Trees.</p>
            <p>At laſt, however, we arriv'd at
<hi>Nantes,</hi> and after ten days ſtay, we took
Horſe for <hi>Breſt:</hi> what we ſaw of <hi>Britany</hi>
as we paſt, was not very entertaining;
tho' it's known, this Province is good and
fruitful in many places; but all along as
we paſt, we had a very unpleaſant
Proſpect.</p>
            <p>Being arriv'd at <hi>Breſt</hi> the 4th. of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary,</hi>
we expected to Sail in a few
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56915:108"/>
Days; but the Ship was not ready, but
ill careen'd, and had not half her Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and we were to wait till ſhe was
new maſted, and till ſhe was fit to meet
with ſtormy Weather, and the Enemy
which we expected.</p>
            <p>Two Months were ſpent in this Work;
the Ship was call'd the St. <hi>Catherine,</hi> of
four hundred Tun, carrying forty Guns;
'twas built at <hi>Fleſſingue,</hi> and deſign'd for
a Cruiſer; Captain <hi>Monſegue</hi> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
it by orders of the Company.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Breſt.</note>The Port of <hi>Breſt,</hi> where the Frigat
lay, is the beſt we have in the Ocean;
the greatſt Ships ride there in Safety, and
ſhelter'd from all Weather as in a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
whence 'tis call'd by that Name.
Ships may ſail out of it at low Water as
well as at high; for they always ride a-float.
It's as ſtraight at the Month as
a River, and has two Half-Moons of
each ſide, and on the right a ſtrong
Caſtle, old built, which defends the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance.
This Port goes in a Spiral Line;
it's a large half League long, and about
two hundred Paces wide: it's ſituated
between two Mountains, which cover
it. All theſe Advantages it receives from
Nature.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:56915:109"/>
In this Port I ſaw the greateſt and the
beautifuleſt Ships in the World; amongſt
others, the Admiral, nam'd the <hi>Royal
Sun;</hi> it has not ſo much gilding as the
<hi>Royal Lewis</hi> of <hi>Toulon,</hi> but 'tis better built;
longer, and a better Sailer. It carries 120
Guns, and the great Cabine is magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent,
richly gilt, and the Cieling is of
the Deſign Monſieur <hi>le Poune:</hi> there
are about fifteen more but of a leſſer ſize;
yet very proper, and beautifully built.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe, there were about fifty
more of 90, 80, 70, 60, and 50 Guns,
without reckoning ſmaller Frigats of a
lower Rate: next to the <hi>Royal Sun,</hi> are
the <hi>Queen,</hi> the <hi>Crown,</hi> the <hi>Glorious,</hi> the
<hi>Beautiful,</hi> the <hi>Good,</hi> the <hi>Thunderer,</hi> the
the <hi>Lightning,</hi> the <hi>Diamond,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe
vaſt Machines give juſt Wonder, and
appear like floating Palaces.</p>
            <p>Our Ship being compleatly equip'd, it
ſail'd out of the <hi>Chamber</hi> into the Road
the 20th. of <hi>March;</hi> five of the Kings
Ships were fitted out at the ſame time,
of which four were to joyn thoſe of
<hi>Toulon,</hi> and the fifth to Convoy ſome
Ships belonging to the <hi>Eaſt-India-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</hi>

               <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 9th of <hi>April</hi> 1682. I
embark'd with four Sons of a Family
which went with us: as Monſieur <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cort</hi>
continu'd ſtill at <hi>Breſt,</hi> theſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
and I diverted our ſelves a little
with Hunting, believing we might as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
go a-ſhore again as we came aboard:
the Director's Cook who came aboard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
ſome buſineſs, made uſe of a little
Skiff which was row'd by two Lads,
which we us'd to go a-ſhore in; and
were now got 2 Leagues on the Sea near
<hi>Cameret,</hi> without minding which way
he ſhould get back: we were ſo earneſt
taking the Diverſion of Hunting, that
we did not care where we put a-ſhore,
without minding the Danger we ran,
in paſſing over craggy Rocks hanging
over the Sea, into which I had like to
fall two or three times. And after all
this pains, we had the Diſappointment to
meet with no Game; we were forc'd
to employ our ſelves in killing Larks,
which prov'd afterwards more of uſe to
us then we imagin'd then: tir'd therefore
with this ſort of Hunting, we paſt to a
better Entertainment, and fell to a Hare-Paſty,
which we brought with us, and a
Glaſs of good Wine.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:56915:110"/>
After we had ſpent our Proviſions, we
return'd to our little Boat, and were no
ſooner at Sea again, than a ſudden Storm
aroſe, in which I thought we ſhould
have periſh'd every moment. One of
our Gentlemen who was very much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigu'd,
had fall'n aſleep as ſoon as ever
he came into the Skiff, and was wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken'd
by our Noiſe, and the toſſing of
the Boat; and when we were half way,
tho' he was ſcarce throughly awake, he
was ſo ſenſible of the Danger we were in,
that he cry'd out, We were certainly
loſt if we did not return again.</p>
            <p>Our little Rowers were almoſt ſpent,
but not their Courage, who pretended
to chear us, ſaying, There was no Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of the Boat, tho' ſhe rowl'd ſo; and
if the worſt came to the worſt, 'twas on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſwimming for't: but they were mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken
as to me; and beſides, the Waves
were ſo great and violent, that inſtead
of landing us, they had daſh'd us in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
againſt the Rocks.</p>
            <p>We follow'd the Counſel of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion,
and turn'd back again, rowing
with all our Might; and at laſt, with
much ado, got a-ſhore, where we wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for calmer Weather.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:56915:110"/>
In the mean time, while we were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying
our Safety a-ſhore, we heard a
ſingle Gun, and ſaw at the ſame time
the Top-Sails looſe, which is the uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Signal of Sailing: There were ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Lighters near us, which might have
carry'd us aboard; but we could not
prevail with any of the Maſters to whom
they belong'd, to give us a Caſt.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſaw our Ship under Sail, the
Admiral ſaluted with ſeven Guns, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the beſt of her way, running be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Wind, with all the Sail ſhe could
make; and I was not a little troubled
to be left behind thus, and all my Things
aboard.</p>
            <p>We follow'd the ſight of our Veſſel,
haling her as loud as ever we could baul,
and diſcharging our Fuſeels, but all in
vain, the Veſſel diſappear'd; one of our
Companions, who was but an ill Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
took <hi>Cameret</hi> Road, believing
he ſhould find us there; and being in
ſearch of him, we ſpent a good part
of the Night in looking after one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Many Misfortunes attended us on our
way; for ever and anon, one was bogg'd
in the Marſhes, another would fall into
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56915:111"/>
a Ditch, each calling on the other for
help, and all curſing the Chaſe: Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
follow'd our other Miſeries, when
at laſt we got into an Inn, where every
thing was proportionable to our ſhort
Purſes; wretched Proviſion and Beds:
however, all that we had was ſpent that
Night, and we were forc'd to depart
Faſting next Morning.</p>
            <p>As we went again in ſearch of our
ſtray'd Companion, and coaſting by the
Sea, we perceiv'd Maſts, which at firſt
we took for high Trees which grew by
the Sea, not ſo much as flattering our
ſelves that we ſhould ever ſee our Ship
again, which we thought had been far
enough off; but coming near, we found
we had not loſt our Paſſage, for ſhe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor'd
in <hi>Camaret</hi> Road, three Leagues
from <hi>Breſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Great was our Joy, and we had now
no more to do but to find out our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion,
and go aboard: we endeavour'd
by Signals to give notice of us to the
Ship, but with no better Succeſs than
the Day before; ſo that the Sloap did
not come to fetch us.</p>
            <p>As we ſought all imaginable ways to
get out of our Troubles, we obſerv'd a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56915:111"/>
Bark at Sea plying towards the Ship; I
don't know how we came to fancy that
he whom we ſought might be in it; but
we fancy'd right, and he was the firſt
Man we perceiv'd from the Shore; ſo we
made Signs to 'em at a diſtance, which
he underſtood, and the Bark made to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
us: but it being impoſſible to
come near, by reaſon of the Rocks,
'twas our Buſineſs to get aboard as well
as we could.</p>
            <p>At laſt we did; and after a great deal
of Rejoycing at our Meeting ſo happily
again, we thought of nothing but taking
our Reſt: but this was not the time;
for the Sea was ſo rough, that the Waves
went over the Ship, and we were wet
from Head to Foot. This, joyn'd with
the exceſſive Cold, and the Danger we
were in of being caſt-away, which the
Seamen themſelves fear'd not a little,
caſt us into a freſh Concern, till after
much Difficulty and Hazard we got
aboard.</p>
            <p>At our leiſure we revolv'd all our paſt
dangers, and preſently fell to eating
after hard Faſts; we remain'd ſome
time in the Road, waiting for Monſieur
<hi>Dancourt,</hi> who was ſtill aſhore at <hi>Breſt.</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:56915:112"/>
On <hi>Sunday,</hi> at Noon, <hi>April</hi> the 12th,
1682. he came Aboard, and immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
we Sail'd.</p>
            <p>When we were about three Leagues
at Sea, we met the Ship Nam'd the
<hi>Burning,</hi> which lay at Anchor, waiting
the Tide to enter into the Bay of <hi>Breſt;</hi>
ſhe was mounted with 80 Guns, and came
from <hi>Havre,</hi> to take Monſieur <hi>de Prouily,</hi>
Lieutenant-General, Aboard, who was
afterwards to Sail to <hi>Algiers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We Saluted him in the uſual manner,
with 7 Guns, and crying out three times
<hi>Vive le Roy;</hi> he anſwer'd us with as
many, againſt the uſual cuſtom of the

This Inundation, which enriches the
Country, is not general, nor extends
beyond the Neighbourhood of the River.
At this time, the Bed of the River is not
known; its Channel neither being deep
enough to contain its Waters; nor ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Current enough to ſweep them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Sea, they drown'd the Valleys
and the lower Grounds, and cover
all.</p>
            <p>'Tis dangerous at theſe times to Sail

into the Heart of his Court.
When any great Lord, tho' he be his
Relation, would have Audience of him,
he pulls off his Frock at his entrance
into the Court, being quite naked from
the Waiſt upwards; when he draws
near the place where the King is, he
throws himſelf on his Knees, afterwards
bows his Head, and with his both
Hands ſtrews Sand on his Face and
Head, then riſes, and repeats the ſame
Ceremony often at ſuch a diſtance, till
he comes within two ſteps of the King:
Being there, he ſtops, and declares the
Motives he had for demanding Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
His Compliment ended, which
is made on the Knee, he riſes without
daring to look at the King, reſting his
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:56915:162"/>
Hands on his Knees, and from time to
time ſling Sand on his Forehead.</p>
            <p>The Prince, who carries it very high
to his Subjects, makes a ſhew as if he
ſcarce heard him, and ſo diverts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
with ſomething elſe; yet, however,
at laſt, he vouchſafes him a ſhort An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,

Power that Preſents have over theſe
Kings, and what little Regard they have
to Juſtice: Two little Tributary Kings
to <hi>Damel,</hi> were at ſtrife concerning the
Succeſſion to a little poor Sovereignty;
they were Brother and Son to the late
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:56915:164"/>
Prince, and bottom'd their Pretenſions
on divers Reaſons, too tedious, and too
inconſiderable to be mention'd here.
They propos'd to end their Difference
by force, or the King's deciſion; the
King having forbid the firſt, they
were forc'd to ſtand to his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>On the Day appointed for giving
Judgment in their Difference, the two
Parties met in the great Place before
the Court, accompanied with great
Numbers, that ſeem'd to form two Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talions,
about thirty Yards diſtant from

Darts, Bows, Zagages, Javelins, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſco

appear'd mounted on a fine <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary</hi>

            <p>Tho' they all ſpoke the ſame Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
yet they made uſe of Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
who told the King again what
they heard. The Son of the deceas'd
ended his Diſcourſe, in remonſtrating
to him, That ſeeing it had pleaſed GOD
to beſtow the Sovereignty in diſpute
on his Father, the Right of it now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:56915:164"/>

having heard him attentively, ſaid to
him with an Air full of Gravity, GOD
has given it you, and I give it you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain

            <p>Such an Anſwer preſently diſpers'd
the Party of the Uncle, who retir'd
all alone. The <hi>Guiriot</hi>'s with their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments

the Praiſes of the Victorious, ſaying to
him, You beſt deſerv'd it, the King
has done you Juſtice; for you are more

            <p>He will by no means ſuffer the <hi>Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babes</hi>

fall aboard the Fleſh, which they tear

they have gnaw'd it, they put it into
the Diſh again for the next. They
uſe only their Right-hand in eating;
which is always at Noon and Night;

a ſort of Skirmiſhing Excurſion. In

which is a ſort of a Dart, long and

than thoſe of Arrows, and have ſeveral
ſmall Hooks, that tears open the wound
when they draw it. They can caſt
theſe Zagayes a great way, and go ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
rarely without them: Beſides theſe
they have a Cimeter, and a Moriſco
Knife, about half a Yard long, and two
Inches wide: They guard the Blows
with a round Buckler made of thick
Leather; and tho' they are encumbred
with ſo many Utenſils, yet they have
their Hands and Arms at liberty, and
can fight ſmartly.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Arms of the Foot.</note>The Foot are arm'd with a Cime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

            <p>Their Bow is made of a Cane, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling

That which they make uſe of for the
String, is another ſort of Wood, very
curiouſly fitted up for that purpoſe.
They are ſo dextrous in ſhooting out
of Bows, that at fifty Yards diſtance
they'll hit a Mark, the breadth of a
Crown piece. They march without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

            <p>As ſoon as they are within ſhot, the
Infantry diſcharge their Arrows, and
the Horſe caſt their Javelins. This
diſcharge is follow'd with blows of
Zagayes. They ſpare their Enemies as
much as poſſible, that they may make
the more Slaves; from which their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons

as they are naked and expert in the

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:56915:167"/>
always very Bloody. They are very

that be guilty of the leaſt Cowardice.
The deſpight that is ſhow'd to a Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard
