            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Ought to take notice (as I think all the Intelligent do) of your Generous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, and free Readineſs to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to the <hi>Royal Society,</hi> and thence to the Public, whatſoever is, upon ſure accompt, ſuggeſted for the welfare of any of his Majeſties Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. And thoſe Hortulan Affairs are not the leaſt of our Inland Commodities; and they have been the ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous engagement of the ſaid <hi>Royal Society</hi> from the firſt Year of their Inſtitution; and have proſpered exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly in many parts of <hi>England,</hi> and in ſome parts of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The great Example of his Majeſty, and of our Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and generally of our chief Gentry, hath prevailed from the Eaſt all over the Weſt, ſo far as to encompaſs <hi>Oxford.</hi> And the ſtop is ſaid to be about <hi>Cambridge:</hi> And here are thoſe Expedients propoſed, which may be effectual to remove all Obſtacles. And, if the Gentry about <hi>Cambridge</hi> ſhall be pleaſed to accept of them, and henceforth to be ſtirring in the buſineſs, as is here di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, they may ſoon overtake all that's done about <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> and advance more in five years, than hath hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to been done in twenty, though it is not little that hath been done of late. For theſe Arts, and our Experience, and more Expedients alſo, do grow daily.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:95619:3"/>One ſaid, that if we had one skilful and diligent Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery-man, who had a complete Nurſery of all ſorts of good fruit, and of the beſt Vines that agree beſt with this Climate, and Mulberry Trees, and wholſom Trees for the avenues of Cities, Towns, and fair Manſions; That one ſuch Nurſery within ten or fifteen miles in all the Vales of theſe three united Kingdoms, would make all theſe Plantations ſpread apace, and amount to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of Millions yearly. I anſwered, That it was now do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: And every reaſonable man eaſily apprehends, how a noble Orchard may be raiſed together with ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete Nurſery, under the ſame inſpection, and the ſame care; and the one grow on and proſper the better by the aſſociation of the other. And I ſhall here ſhew, How a younger Brother of ordinary capacities, who hath but ſo many Acres of his own as belong to every Cottager by Statute, may thence eaſily and ſpeedily raiſe a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable gain, for the maintenance of his Family, and entertain himſelf with the ſweeteſt and moſt innocent of Earthly pleaſures. And it is great ſatisfaction, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſic comfort to an ingenuous Mind, when he can truly ſay, that all the good Vines, and other beſt fruit in all the Neighbourhood, and for ſome miles about him, are the product of his induſtry; and when he can juſtly claim a poſthume reputation for real ſervices done to his Country.</p>
            <p>And here I ſhew, How any Gentleman may freely furniſh all his neighbourhood, even Cottages (who cannot ſend to Mr. <hi>Roſe</hi>) with the beſt Vines: I ſay, <hi>freely,</hi> and at leſs charges yearly, than the uſual price of a Flaggon of good Wine. Yet I know not how it ſhould diſparage our Nobility, to ſuffer their Gardeners to ſell generous Plants, as their Woodmen ſell Timber, and Fuel in their Woods and Coppices, and their Tenants ſell Corn and Cattel in the Market. I am ſure, that many in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95619:3"/>
               <hi>Wiltſhire, Hampſhire, Dorſetſhire,</hi> and <hi>Sommerſetſhire</hi> are obliged and the richer for the famous Garden of <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> and for the goodly Nurſeries about <hi>Salisbury.</hi> And his Majeſties Gardiner, Mr. <hi>Roſe,</hi> was an obliging Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample for his ſale of the beſt Vines, and the fitteſt for our Climate.</p>
            <p>By this progreſs, and by theſe rules, we cannot fail of good Nurſeries within Ten miles in all our Vales. And this I can propheſie, that where the Tenants have not Orchards, and others have, they will ſhortly fail to pay their Rents. If they cannot be truſted to preſerve and to cheriſh Orchards raiſed at the Landlords charge, they ſhould be compelled to raiſe <hi>Thickets,</hi> as is here taught; that Orchards may the ſooner and the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier be there raiſed when a Tenant comes that may be truſted: Otherwiſe the Lands of Gentlemen will fall, whilſt the Lands of ſmall Freeholders are raiſed in value.</p>
            <p>There is no need, I ſhould ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> much to invite the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumers of their Inheritance, and the Deſertors of their Country, to put their hands to puſh on this affair, ſince the Ingenious Author of the <hi>Gentlemans Recreation</hi> hath ſaid enough to call them out of their B—houſes, and ſcurrilous P—houſes: And the polite Author of the <hi>Planters Manual</hi> ſpeaks good Engliſh to the Eſteminate Phantaſticks. For, if none of the Rural recreations, Hunting, Hawking, Fowling, Fiſhing; nor any of the Amenities, profits or pleaſures of Gardens, Vineyards, Orchards; nor ſpicy and fragrant Groves, can reclaim the Prodigal, I have no more to ſay to him, but only, if he underſtands Latine, mind him of the old ſtyle, about 1500 years ago, twice recorded againſt ſuch Romans as became degenerate:

Upon this authentic and ſure ground, according to our beſt old Rules, by which real merit is to be preferred before undeſerved Titles; and by which he that does moſt good for his Country hath a juſt claim to the higheſt merit: In theſe reſpects we are obliged to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute more to a Laborious and Skilful Nurſery-man, in his home-ſpun Raiments of Engliſh Manufacture, than to an idle Prodigal with his ſumptuous Equipage of exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic Embroideries. And in regard of Mr. <hi>Auſtens</hi> merit towards <hi>Oxford</hi> and the Public, a worthy Friend hath deviſed a Monument for him: It is in great Roman Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Gold upon a Black Marble, the beſt Touch: The Figure round, agreeable to the roundneſs of this
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95619:5"/>

            <p n="4">4. And it is newly modern, to raiſe Cider that ſhall compare, and excel the Wine of many Provinces nearer the Sun, where they abound with fruitful Vineyards. It is ſo newly Modern, I ſay, to raiſe Cider to ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and it is generally thought incredible, and is hardly believed, where the full proof is not at hand. And it is certain, that Mr. <hi>Auſten</hi> was buſie at his Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments in preparing Redſtreaks for <hi>Oxford</hi> long before vulgar Cider was to be gotten there for money: So that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95619:6"/>
Malice it ſelf cannot deny the truth of the Inſcription. And poſſibly the next Age may enroll him among <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors,</hi> as if he had ſounded or endowed a Colledge. For by experience it is throughly confirmed, That a ſeaſonable and moderate uſe of good Cider is the ſureſt remedy and preſervative againſt the Diſeaſes which do frequently afflict the ſedentary Life of them that are ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſtudious. And M. <hi>Auſten</hi> hath now very lately taken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in twenty ſeven Acres of ground, to enlarge his former Nurſeries, and for New Plantations. And this was part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the occaſion of this preſent Addreſs, and of this my Adventure (though from an obſcure hand) to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it to your Regiſter.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And my Friend ſeriouſly proteſts, That he ſhall moſt gladly embrace the ſame occaſion, to celebrate, in the beſt manner he can deviſe, the Names and memory of thoſe who ſhall have the happineſs to do good in the ſame kind for <hi>Cambridge,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Auſten</hi> hath done and ſtill continues to do for <hi>Oxford.</hi> And the merit will be ſignal: For, beſides the Amenities and other Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of health, and ſweet Air, when <hi>both <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities</hi> ſhall be inveſted in a Golden Grove, it will have a good influence to allure the like improvements in all parts of <hi>England.</hi> What is well done for Ornament, Health, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Pleaſure, and conſiderable Profit (all joyned together) in the Eyes of both Univerſities, will doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs more ſpeedily be every where exemplified, and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually obtain a progreſs all over the Kingdom.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And, if <hi>Cambridge</hi> ſhould be the Example, it would, without doubt, excite very great improvements to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>North,</hi> and in many Countries about the Heart of <hi>England.</hi> For, if any Expedient can invite the Champain-Countries, that are about <hi>Cambridge,</hi> to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſures, I think, Orchards, Gardens, Nurſeries, and Groves, are moſt likely to do it; theſe yielding Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95619:6"/>
and other moſt profitable materials, to enable and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage for Incloſures; and Gardens every year repaying a full reward, whilſt the ſtandards of ſlower growth do yet ſtill grow on for a more laſting and a more noble ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p n="7">7. And for an old Authentical proof, that Vulgar In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſures, in the old ordinary manner, are more than a Tenfold improvement, give me leave to ſend you an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of <hi>T.

            <p>Sir, this is the old form; and <hi>Tuſſers</hi> rules are eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the beſt that are extant at this day, for the generality of Husbandry and Huſwifry, to them that can bear his Canting Rhimes. All later Writers, and long experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence do confirm this his Sentiment; and all his Inſtances do hold too true to this day. By <hi>Incloſures</hi> and <hi>Culture</hi> the worſt Land in <hi>England</hi> yields Tenfold more profit (beſides many other advantages hinted here and in other parts of his Compariſon) than that which is here called the beſt and richeſt Land; as will yet appear, if we compare theſe, which were lately the furzy parts of <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> with the Champain of <hi>Leiceſterſhire</hi> and <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgeſhire.</hi> And what he ſaith here, is all to very great purpoſe; for offices of Charity, Imployment for the Poor; and for multitudes of Labourers; for Populouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the ſtrength, riches, and glory of the Kingdom. And if he may challenge a Tenfold improvement for the ordinary Incloſures of thoſe times; we may with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty promiſe a Twenty-fold, for our extraordinary and modern skill in Hortulan affairs. And in his laſt clauſe <hi>Tuſſer</hi> ſhews, That the Lords of Mannors are as much concerned for the advance of their Revenues by Inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, as the Vulgar for their eaſe, plenty, and ſome kind of proſperity.

            <p n="8">8. Now I proceed to repreſent, with what facility this great and good work may be brought on by <hi>Nurſeries,</hi> and young <hi>Thickets</hi> of Quickſets. Every Lord of a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and moſt of the ſubſtantial Free-holders, can find a few Acres ſafely incloſed for ſuch purpoſe, in his own poſſeſſion; and a few Acres, rightly ordered for thoſe Uſes may furniſh a Province for Quickſets, and all ſorts of better Standards for Orchards. How it may be done at ſmall charges, and with diſpatch, our <hi>Tuſſer</hi> will tell us:
<q>
                  <l>Go, plow up, or delve up, adviſed with skill,</l>
                  <l>The breadth of a ridge, and in length as ye will;</l>
                  <l>Whoſe ſpeedy Quickſet for a fence ye will draw,</l>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This is the brief of the old plain way: And this is in the worſt caſe, namely, to beget a Fence or Incloſure where there is none: And any Bramble or other wild buſhes are better than no fence. But where the Incloſure is already provided, his advice is more magnificent or lofty:
<q>
                  <l>Sow Acorns, ye Owners that Timber do love,</l>
                  <l>Sow haw and Rye with them the better to prove.</l>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And, if the ground be reaſonably in heart, and of a ſufficient depth, a ſtrong Plow by croſs plowing, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95619:8"/>
weighty Harrows may make the ground mellow, and fine enough for the Seeds of all hedges, buſhes, and trees of the Neighbourhood; for Seeds of Aſhes, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, Elms, Sycamores, and the like; and for Kernels of Crabs, Apples, and Pears, and for Stones of all ſtone-fruit. There alſo they may prick-in, or ſet with the Hoe, Walnuts, Cheſnuts, Beech, Nuts, Filberts; and for no great charge, the Seeds of Pines, Firrs, and whatever elſe the Owners delight in, as is copiouſly digeſted in Mr. <hi>Evelyns</hi> SYLVA. For ſuch Seeds as require finer work, here and there the Garden-Rake may do it. And for ſuch as do not kindly bear Tranſplantation, and for ſuch as are to remain there for ſtandards, the Seeds may be ſet, three or four in a place, at fit diſtance, and in rows of the <hi>Quincunx Order,</hi> or in perfect Squares.</p>
            <p n="9">9. I have heard ſome good Husbandmen ſay, They can well remember, when this ſlight way was the only way that was in uſe to raiſe theſe Orchards which are now eſteemed the beſt, and the moſt fruitful in <hi>England.</hi> And it is yet pleaded, by ſome of good experience, that the <hi>Wildings,</hi> taken out of ſuch Thickets, do common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thrive better upon removals into Nurſeries or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards, than thoſe Plants that have been tended more curiouſly and nicely. And in reaſon we may probably expect, That Seedlings or Stocks, drawn out of Thickets thus rudely ordered, ſhould be kinder than thoſe which are taken from Roots, or from Under-trees, or from Hedge-rows, or out of the wildeſt Coppices, whether the Seeds were brought by Birds, or other caſualties, where they were left to ſhift for their own propagation, without other culture. And yet by common experience we find, that theſe Shifters do thrive well enough for Tranſplantations into Nurſeries or Orchards. If the root and the lower part of the ſtem be ſound, the graft which is placed there ſeldom complains of the injuries
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95619:8"/>
done to the top, before the graffing, by droppings of Trees, or by bruttings of Cattle, or by oppreſſion or incroachments of neighbouring Plants. I have oftentimes ſeen theſe, when at full freedom, advance their grafts more ſpeedily, than thoſe that have been moſt tended by curious culture.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Some nice <hi>Wall-fruit,</hi> and ſuch as are to be plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Gardens, may deſerve a more curious diligence at firſt: And in this our thicket, if the ſoyl and ſhelter will allow it, the Rake may prepare fit places for theſe, or for any kind of curioſities. For which there may be found accurate directions in the <hi>French Gardiner,</hi> and in the <hi>Sieur le Gendre</hi> his manner of Ordering Fruit-trees by an experience of almoſt fifty years, as he ſaith in his Inſpiring Preface.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Now we come to the main point. Some of theſe Quickſets will be ready and fit to be drawn for the Neighbourhood every year. And, if they be taken up with diſcretion, thoſe which remain, eſpecially ſuch as are fit to be left for ſtandards, will thrive much the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the frequent, gentle, and wary ſtirring or turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the earth about their roots. And at this cheap rate, (and indeed for the better advance of our own Quickſets,) here is work enough, and ſtuff enough, to engage all the Ring-leaders of the tumultuous Rabble, to call in all their Parties, and to ſtickle as ſtoutly for Incloſures as ever they did formerly to hinder them. Meanwhile, Gentlemen and Freeholders may thus ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate themſelves, and ſet eaſie bargains to all their own Relations, and adherents, younger Brothers, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and Tenants; which, in the end, will prove a great increaſe of their own Patrimonies and Revenues, and a bleſſing to all the Neighbourhood. And thus, many <hi>Commons,</hi> which have been hitherto little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than waſte-grounds, may in a ſhort time become
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95619:9"/>
populous Villages, and well provided of all neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
            <p n="12">12. And becauſe our experience grows yearly, by new diſcoveries of excellent Cider-fruit, for all Seaſons, and for all diverſities of palates; for the firſt Summer, and for durance, two, three, four, or more years; ſome by their peculiar kind, and ſome by right ſorting them in mixtures, in the grinding time (by both which ways we in the Weſt have already found many ſorts of Cider, that do manifeſtly far excell all the ordinary ſorts of French Wine, <hi>nemine contradicente</hi>;) Therefore ſome worthy Gentlemen are endeavouring to eſtabliſh a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence of Free Contributers, Gardeners and Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery-men from all the Weſt and South, towards <hi>Oxford,</hi> thence towards <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and ſo all over <hi>England.</hi> This to be at leaſt once, but better twice in the year, <hi>viz.</hi> in Autumn (when the fruit and the ordering of the fruit and Cider may be ſeen, and when the Kernels and Seeds of all fruits may be had;) and eſpecially in the early Spring, when all ſorts of Grafts may be had; many thouſands of Graffs eaſie to be carried in a Portmantle, if they know, how the Cions may be uſed for a Graff (which point few Gardeners or Graffers themſelves did know, till I taught them.)</p>
            <p n="13">13. And thus a Gentleman, or an ingenious Gardener may learn more in a few days travelling, than can be written in large Volumes, or than would ever come in his mind to enquire at home. At preſent I offer two ſpecial and extraordinary Remarks for Nurſery-men:</p>
            <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> is from Dr. <hi>Munting</hi> in the Philoſophical Tranſactions, <hi>N.</hi> III. p. 248. <q>To graff upon ſuch Apple-ſtocks as are raiſed from the ſame kind of Seeds, and have been deprived of the <hi>heart-root,</hi> which is the ſame that deſcends <hi>directly.</hi> Thus, he ſaith, we may
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95619:9"/>
obtain extraordinary good, big, and beautiful Apple-fruit. I conceive it probable, and that in time by changes of the like kind in Pears, and many other fruits, a cloſer friendſhip between the Stock and the Graff may be eſtabliſhed. And this is an <hi>Item</hi> for our Travelling Nurſery-man to furniſh his Portmantle with the Seeds of ſpecial fruit apart, or in the marc, where they can be had fulleſt, thickeſt, and leaſt bruiſed. Theſe they may ſow in beds apart; as, for example, the kernels of Red-ſtrakes in beds deſigned for the Graffs of Red-ſtrakes: So of Pears, and other fruit. Some kinds of Plants will not well endure, that the <hi>heart-root</hi> be cut off. In ſuch caſes ſome put a Tile-ſtone under the heart-root, and bow the root aſide, that it may run on, and grow in better manner than is at diſtance under the ſurface.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>My <hi>ſecond</hi> remark I can better aſſure, namely, To chooſe for ſome beds the ſeeds of the largeſt Trees, which conſtantly bear the greateſt burthen of good and profitable fruit; as I can name, where an Apple-tree, where many Pear-trees (ſome for delicate fruit, and ſome for their liquor,) and where Crab-trees are of ſuch huge bulk, and of ſuch ſpreading growth, that conſtantly each of them do yearly bear three, four, or five hogſheads of liquor. The ſeed of theſe for ſtocks to graff of the ſame, would doubtleſs be ſtately Trees for a noble Orchard, at fifty foot diſtance at leaſt. But more of this hereafter. One skilful and diligent Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner, or Nurſery-man, within ten or fifteen miles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, in all the Vales of <hi>England,</hi> would drive on theſe Plantations apace all over <hi>England,</hi> to the great gain of the Gardener. And the like we may hope of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p n="14">14. To have good Red-ſtrake, or any other excellent Cider, or the beſt Perry, the fruit muſt be perfectly
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95619:10"/>
ripe and odorous, and ſuch only ſhaken off the Trees at firſt; the reſt to abide there till perfectly ripe: And it is the better, if they lie in heaps a week or fortnight. If ſome be rotten, the liquor is not the worſe (as Mr. <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> rightly obſerves,) it is the better; if the rottenneſs be not fetid, muſty, hoary, or black rottenneſs: Such muſt be carefully caſt away. And ſome ſay for the beſt Cherry-wine, the Cherries muſt hang on the Trees two days fully ripe, and abide two or three days after ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering before they be preſſed; though they ſeem brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and almoſt rotten. In <hi>France</hi> I have ſeen Grapes lie a good while in a huge Vat, preſſed and bruiſed with their own weight, before they began to tread them: And no Grapes are at the beſt, or ſafely wholſom to be eaten, till three or four days after gathering. I have oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times tried, and uſed whole hogſheads of Red-ſtrakes and Gennet-moyle, mixed by equal portions, in grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing time, and either apart was generally preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the mixture.</p>
            <p>I never had better Cider, than when (after the care above-ſaid for ripeneſs and lying in heaps) I cauſed it to be grinded and preſſed with diſpatch, and ſpeedily put into the Hogſheads, and the Hogſheads immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cloſed up perfectly, ſufficient room being left for the liquor to ferment. All the following Summer it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued brisk, ſprightful, ſtrong; and ſmoother or leſs windy than when bottled. It is certain, that the groſs matter (which ſome body calls the <hi>cruſt</hi>) preſerves the liquor in ſpirit, as kindly as if bottled: This I obſerved, when the liquor was put into the Veſſels very negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, and foul of the Mare. And they ſay, ſome La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies do ſpoyl their Meaths and Metheglins by ſcumming them ſo nicely as to hinder ſeaſonable fermentation. The liquor which comes firſt and eaſieſt from the Preſs is beſt. It is an endleſs trouble, to pare and pick apples;
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95619:10"/>
which would be laughed at in the Cider-Countries: But I ſhould well accept of a Cider-mill, which would ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the rind, kernels, and ſtems; as I read in <hi>Vinetum Britannicum,</hi> and in your <hi>Philoſophical Tranſactions, Numb. 124. p. 584.</hi>

               <hi>The Second LETTER.</hi> Concerning ORCHARDS &amp; VINEYARDS, By <hi>John Beale,</hi> D. D. and Fellow of the <hi>Royal Society.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>I Am glad they have <hi>Cherry-Orchards</hi> in the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of <hi>Cambridge.</hi> Theſe, if ordered for their beſt advantage, will be no obſtruction, but a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per expedient to bring on Plantations of Nurſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and of Orchards for the beſt Cider, and for other good fruit. And a very fine and brisk Wine may be made of ſome ſorts of Cherries: But few have yet hit the right Art of making the beſt Cherry-Wine. Sir <hi>Kenelm Digby</hi> ſhews us his way of making Cherry-Wine, in his <hi>Cloſet</hi>; a Book, which will ſhortly be in great eſteem for manifold uſes, but eſpecially when our good hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Ladies have throughly learnt the due manner of uſing Sugar and ſeaſonable Fermentations for as many or more kinds of Artificial Wines, as heretofore, and at preſent, they uſe Honey to make Meaths, Metheglins, Braggets, Hydromels, Medeas, and ſuch like Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: Of which ſorts I think he reckons above 90 ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ways, practiſed by honourable Perſons in <hi>England</hi>; and where theſe Honey-drinks are made beſt, and are in greateſt eſteem in other parts of <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. When the uſe of Sugar ſhall be brought into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon practice, and as well known as the uſe of Honey is and hath been many Ages; then we ſhall know the true worth of Dr. <hi>Jonathan Goddards</hi> propoſal for making
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:95619:12"/>
Wine of the Sugar-cane, mentioned in the <hi>Hiſtory of the Royal Society,</hi> p. 193. For, when we have done our beſt for Cider, it is only the Sugar-cane that can challenge all the Vines in the world. And if theſe be ſometimes offenſive by too much luſciouſneſs, they may be helped by wholſom mixtures of a pleaſing auſtereneſs, or gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle poignancy, more acceptable to the ſtomach. This may be had from ſome ſorts of <hi>Plums,</hi> and other Vinous Berries; of which <hi>Vinetum Britannicum</hi> gives the fulleſt accompt of any that is yet extant. This <hi>Vinetum</hi> and Sir <hi>Kenelm Digby</hi>'s <hi>Cloſet</hi> are at preſent ſeaſonable furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for a Ladies Cloſet, to inſtruct in that practical de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion and charity, which obligeth our Country, and keeps the Poor from idleneſs and famine.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And ſuch mixtures of the Wine of the Grape as theſe, which I here propoſe for mixtures with Sugar, and much more than I can propoſe (without Tranſcripts) are ſo ancient, both in old <hi>Greece</hi> and in old <hi>Italy,</hi> that I think no Antiquary can name their Origin. For two thouſand years we are ſure, and can ſhew abundance of particular Receipts, the Ingredients, and the Doſe, punctually in <hi>Cato, Columella, Conſtantine</hi> the Emperour, and <hi>Palladius,</hi> who derives one of his Compoſitions from the Oracle of <hi>Apollo, (Quod Cretenſibus Oraculum Pithii Apollinis monſtraſſe memoratur,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Octob. Tit.</hi> 14.) And we know, that <hi>Crete</hi> or <hi>Candy</hi> hath been long famous for excellent Wines. I cannot ſay, how far the ancient Conditures of Wine, and their mixtures and boylings of Wine, do agree with our modern ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtications, and jumblings, and recoveries; but for wholſomneſs I dare lay a good wager on the ſide of the Ancients; my ſelf to drink it in the old way; our Merchants and Vintners to drink it in their own new dreſs. And for varieties, I dare from the Ancients chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge the skilfulleſt of our New men. <hi>Peter de Creſcentii<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

is none of the Ancients; but I may take him on my ſide againſt our laſt Innovators, dwelling at the ſign of the Buſh. And this boldneſs I take (though with ſome compaſs) to hedge in a defence of the deſign of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netum Britannicum,</hi> and of our honourable Ladies artificial Wines, made by the mixture of Sugar, with all the fanative and reſtorative Simples, Vegetables, Spices, and Drugs, which Nature hath hitherto brought forth.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But yet I have much to ſay for the Wine of the Grape, though with ſome diſparagement to our own Country-men, who have done ſo little for it, after they have had ſuch bright Inſtructions, and ſuch lively en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements from Mr. <hi>Evelyn</hi> and Mr. <hi>Roſe</hi> in their Engliſh Vineyards, publiſhed <hi>Anno</hi> 1666. Mr. <hi>Roſe</hi> then offering all that deſire it with Sets and Plants of the beſt Vines (ſufficiently tried in our own Soyl and Climate) at reaſonable rates: And Mr. <hi>Hughes</hi> enlarging (in his <hi>Compleat Vineyard,</hi>) as the manner is in <hi>Germany.</hi> And now newly the twice-named <hi>Vinetum</hi> adds more ſpurs, and his particular directions. Our Manſions, and our Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes, and almoſt every Wall, and Bank, and Cottage, hath one ſide aſpecting the South; and both <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> have Mountains and Hills, Precipices and Rocks, as good as Walls to ripen Grapes, for the Table, for Wine, and for Brandy, and (when that fails) for ſauce and for Vinegar. And the labour and art is leſs than every Country-boy learns in a Hop-yard; and one skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful vine-dreſſer may teach hundreds, and whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces; as of late years one skilful Hop-man taught a whole Country. And multitudes raiſe clamours, that Trade decays, and make loud out-cries, that they want work and honeſt employment; and we ſee, and too well know, that <hi>England</hi> ſwarms with idle Vagrants, Beggars, and Indigents; a great burthen and a great ſhame to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:95619:13"/>
the Kingdom. Now here is one ſpecial remedy; and gentile employment for generous Families: And this Paper may yet offer much more of ſure and ſpeedy remedies.</p>
            <p n="5">5. I muſt add a word for Vines, to ſhew, How eaſily and ſpeedily they may be propagated all over <hi>England</hi> at very ſmall charges. Before Mr. <hi>Roſe</hi> obliged us, I found in ſeveral parts of <hi>England</hi> the <hi>Black Cluſter-Grape,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Roſe</hi> commends in the firſt place, and alſo a very excellent White or light Watchet Grape; both which were ſo eaſily ripe, and conſtantly in ſuch abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, far more Northerly than <hi>Cambridge</hi> lies, that I am perſwaded, they will proſper well in ſome parts of <hi>Scotland,</hi> where they have a longer Summer-day than we have; and in thoſe parts of <hi>Ireland,</hi> where they have the ſame Sun that we have, and the Air leſs plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious ſince they have drained many of their great Loughs or Boggs. They are beſt planted from Layers well rooted: But in a bed of ten foot ſquare I tried Cutlings, which had at the foot ſomewhat of the old wood, and there did none of them fail of ſufficient root the firſt year, being ſet at a foot diſtance in the bed: Yea, the ſmall ſprayes proſpered, having ſomewhat of the old wood, (as I may call it,) cut from the branches, on both ſides of the foot of the ſmall ſprayes. And thus we may have a hundred rooted Plants from the prunings of one Vine. I offered them to Cottagers; but they generally anſwered me churliſhly, that they would not be troubled with Grapes: But being told, how little the trouble would be, and that within five years they might have a buſhel of Grapes at a time, which might be ſold for good money in the next Market, a few bunches for a peny, they were ſoon of a more thankful mind. And if Grapes were ſent to Market, as other Fruit is, they would ſoon mind the Plebeians to be as wiſe and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95619:13"/>
happy, as other their Neighbours are. And thus Plants would be ready at hand, for any to try a trench under ſome Sunny banks. And doubtleſs ſome of the hotteſt places neer the foot of the Hills and Mountains in <hi>Wales,</hi> would bear as good Wines, as they did in the days of <hi>Gildas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. This is the Conduct which will be more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual to ſpread <hi>Vineyards</hi> all over <hi>England,</hi> when the meaneſt of the People, even Cottagers, ſhall be concerned to learn ſomewhat of the dreſſing of Vines. And this will do ſomething towards making good my prefacing Addreſs for the advance within five years: <hi>Cherries</hi> and <hi>Plums</hi> will not be long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind. And the beſt <hi>Pears,</hi> when graffed on the Pear-Quince, with ſome help of Walls or Banks, will come on apace. And when in the Country we have learnt to dry all ſorts of fruit, the firſt fruit of Pears will bear a good value. I know ſeveral ſorts of Pears in <hi>England</hi> now, which, being dried, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the dried <hi>Warden</hi> in colour and taſte; and are preferred by moſt men before Marmalades of Quinces, which are too luſcious for mens palats. But <hi>Quinces</hi> alſo make ſome grateful return within five years.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The Vinous ſhrubs out-run all the former, and are at full within two or three years. And hence I ſay again, that, when our Country-Ladies have taught one another the beſt way of drawing buſh-wines or ſhrub-wines by the help of Sugar; it will be a ſudden improvement of <hi>England, Wales,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and a great kindneſs alſo to <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. But that which brings the preſent Hortulan pay the firſt years, to fill the Gardeners long Pouch,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:95619:14"/>
as <hi>Tuſſer</hi> calls it, is the due execution of all points, according to the <hi>French Gardener</hi>; firſt in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of both Univerſities, and other chief Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Towns, and under one where-ever New Orchards (and eſpecially Noble Orchards) are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned.

But I muſt not forſake the <hi>Vine,</hi> upon ſuch eaſie terms, we ſhould get all ſorts of Vines, as it is eaſie for the <hi>Londoners</hi> to do, though they were ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſorts; but firſt from our <hi>next</hi> Neighbours, from all the Coaſt of <hi>France,</hi> and the neareſt on the <hi>Rhine:</hi> Perhaps theſe may do beſt for our ordinary works or firſt Eſſays.

There he praiſes the <hi>Aminean</hi> for a general ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of abounding fertility in every kind of ſoyl, on the Hills, in the Vales, and in mooriſh, moiſt, or ſqualid places. But for rich Wine, he prefers the <hi>Dro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyllan,</hi> and the <hi>Leucothracian</hi> of <hi>Bithynia</hi>; and for early maturity, the <hi>Boline</hi> of <hi>Bithynia.</hi> Of twenty Books of Georgical Precepts or Collections, this Emperour employs five (namely, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII,) to remark the choiceſt Vines, the fitteſt Soyl, the beſt Culture, the ordering the Vintage, and the improvement of Wines by Art, Mixtures, or Compoſitions.</p>

Neither ſhould we neglect the Vines of <hi>Spain,</hi> about St. <hi>Martin,</hi> and <hi>Ribotany,</hi> and <hi>Gibraltar</hi>; of the <hi>Sherry, Malago,</hi>, and the <hi>Canaries:</hi> which laſt Vines are ſaid to prove no other with us, than the Vines of the <hi>Rhine.</hi> But withall it is noted, that of late ſome Vines are found in the <hi>Canaries,</hi> which do much excel all that were formerly there known. And the <hi>Madera</hi> Wines are of a ſtout Maſculine ſtrength, which bears the heat of the Tropics, and holds out in <hi>Barbados</hi> and <hi>Jamaica,</hi> where the beſt Canary is too fulſom and luſcious.</p>

            <p n="15">15. Here is much for Nurſeries and Nurſery-men. But where are the <hi>Seeds,</hi> and <hi>Seeds-men?</hi> This, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, if rightly ordered, would ſecure us of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming more Vegetable Miracles, than the Sun, or the Son of Man ever yet ſaw, and at leſs charges, and perhaps for greater profit, than by ſome of our Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries have hitherto obtained, and (to hold to my former Terms) within five years. True, we have long ſince had the ſtately <hi>Flower of the Sun,</hi> the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel of the World,</hi> the <hi>Crown Imperial,</hi> and many bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bous beauties, <hi>Fritillaries, Anemones,</hi> and <hi>Crocuſſes.</hi> But what trifles are theſe, in compariſon of thoſe Trees, Fruits, Vines, and Herbs, I muſt ſay, noble, enlivening, reſtorative and invigorating Pot-herbs, which may be even in our <hi>American</hi> Plantations, and eaſily obtained for us, or, at leaſt, their Seeds, for trial. Beſides what Mr. <hi>Joſſeline</hi> hath written, I have ſeen ſuch a wonderful Catalogue of all theſe kinds, from <hi>New England</hi> alone, by a very intelligent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that it forced me to cry out, <hi>O, how lazy have we been for a whole Age!</hi> One ſaid, It was but a ſtep or two, and a gentle ſwing from <hi>Whitehall-ſtains</hi> to <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badoes,</hi> or to <hi>Jamaica.

Their walls and defences, the Coral-rocks (as Mr. <hi>Hughs</hi> calls and deſcribes them) of <hi>Jamaica</hi> and the Seas, are meerly the work of God alone. And in a ſhort time, <hi>Jamaica</hi> may be more than ten times fairer (as it is more than ſo much larger) than <hi>Barbados.</hi> One ingenious Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery-man in each of the Engliſh Colonies, corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponding with ingenious Seedmen in <hi>Lombard-ſtreet,</hi> and in <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and in all our chief Port-Towns, (to try all the Seeds we could ſend them, and to return back to their native ſoyl the Seeds of all our Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables which proſpered in any of their ſoyls, and we doing the like to them,) by many returns upon trials, again and again, here and there, would make the work ſhort, and wonderful, and (doubtleſs) exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing profitable, and ſhew us more than any of our <hi>Botanic</hi> Writers ever dreamt of.
