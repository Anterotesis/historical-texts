         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Pon Saturday laſt, I received a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
of Parliament, with a
Commiſſion from his Excellencie
the Earle of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> to command
in chiefe, over the Forces of the
North, and other adjacent Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which great honour and Truſt,
farre above any ambition or merit, by your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
conferred on me, I ſhall exerciſe withall care,
and fidelity, not doubting but that your Lordſhips
will enable me therein, with ſuch other Supplies as
the neceſſity of the Service ſhall require, and that
repreſented from hence.</p>
            <p>The State of the affaires in theſe parts, ſince my
laſt diſpatch of the firſt of this month, ſtand in this
manner, the Earle of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> is come to <hi>Yorke,</hi> and
Joyned his forces to the Earle of <hi>Cumberlands,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
in all as I am informed about 8000 men horſe
and foot, of which there is about 2000 Horſe and
Dragonneers, ſtrength far too potent to be reſiſted
by the ſmall power which I have here, wherof I ſend a
liſt incloſed; our ſtrength was once eſtimated by our
ſelves far greater then now it appeares, for upon the
Earle of <hi>Newcastles</hi> comming over the <hi>Tees,</hi> Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb facs="tcp:52429:3"/>
Loftus</hi> with all the Richmond ſhire men, and Sir
<hi>Henry Anderſon</hi> with all the Cleveland men and the
reſt of the North riding, which were eſtimated at
1000 men, did all returne to their owne Houſes,
ſave about 130 men brought hither by Sir <hi>Mathew
Boynton,</hi> ſome other Gentlemen, and our Troope of
Horſe, raiſed by Sir <hi>Henry Forlis,</hi> and about 40.
Horſe more, brought hither by Captaine <hi>Anderſon;</hi>
And beſides this defect, our numbers are decreaſed
by Sir <hi>Hugh Cholmley,</hi> to whom I have ſent diverſe
Orders to match Northward, to joyn with Captain
<hi>Hotham,</hi> and the reſt in reſiſting the Earle of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtles</hi>
entry, before he came into <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> and ſince
his entry, to come to me, and the reſt of the Armie
at <hi>Todcaſter,</hi> but he found ſuch impediments as hee
could doe neither: And now I heare, he is gone to
<hi>Scarborough,</hi> and taken his Forces with him, which
were about 700 Men, and Colonell <hi>Boynton,</hi> whoſe
Regiment conſiſted of 800 Foot, is likewiſe mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
towards <hi>Hull,</hi> although I ſent him divers Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
to march up hither to aſſiſt the forces at <hi>Todca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi>
giving me neither reaſon of his not comming
to me, nor of his march towards <hi>Hull,</hi> and <hi>I</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
that Sir <hi>Iohn Gell</hi> had raiſed 800 men in <hi>Darbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi>
ſent unto him to march hither, to our Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cors,
but I have received an Anſwer from him,
that he is not able yet to ſtirre from thence; from
Sir <hi>Anthony Irby,</hi> nor the <hi>Lincolnſhire</hi> men, <hi>I</hi> heare
nothing, though I have ſent to them expreſſe Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers,
ſo our whole ſtrength here, (upon returne
of the formerly ſent into the North) conſiſting of
21 Companies of Foot, and 7 Troopes of Horſe,
<pb facs="tcp:52429:3"/>
and one Company of Dragoneeres, wee did ſend of
them two Companies of Foot to ſecure <hi>Selby,</hi> and
one Company to ſecure <hi>Cawood</hi>-Caſtle, and quarte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the reſt, part of them at <hi>Weatherby,</hi> under Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of Captaine <hi>Hotham,</hi> whom I have nominated
to be Lieutenant Generall of the Army, and the reſt
at <hi>Todcaſter,</hi> under my owne command, and upon
Tueſday receiving intelligence that the Earl of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle</hi>
with his whole forces intended to fall upon
our Quarter at <hi>Todcaster,</hi> I ſent to Captaine <hi>Hotham,</hi>
to bring up the forces at <hi>VVeatherby,</hi> which being
done, and the Earle of <hi>Newcaſtles</hi> Army come in
ſight, we drew our men into the uttermoſt part of
our Quarter, where we had raiſed ſome breaſt-works
for our Muſquetiers, and there the fight began about
11 of the clocke; and ſo continued in ſharp diſpute
untill about 4 of the clock in the evening; in which
time there was at leaſt 40 Thouſand Muſquets ſhot
diſcharged, on both ſides, and great numbers of can<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>non
ſhot.</p>
            <p>The Enemy had once won part of the Towne and
beaten our men, and placed ſome of their Companies
in two or three houſes, which did much indanger us,
but in the end our men with great corage forced them
out again, recovered and burnt the houſes, and kild
many of the Enemies men that were there placed, and
in concluſion, forced the whole Army to retreate,
leaving very many of their men dead, and very great
numbers wounded, the certaine numbers, nor quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the perſons we could not take, but it is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
ſaid by the Countrey people that there were at
leaſt 100 found kild and burnt, and we tooke 17 pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners
<pb facs="tcp:52429:4"/>
in the fight, &amp; on our part we loſt 6 men, and
Captaine William <hi>Lyster,</hi> a valiant and gallant Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
who was ſhot with a Muſquet bullet in the
head, and we had about 20 more wounded, and loſt
not one Priſoner in the Battell, though divers of our
men being negligent of their duty ſtayed behind us
when we quit the Quarter, and ſo were taken the next
day there, by the Enemies, and made Priſoners; in
this fight our men behaved themſelves with very great
reſolution, far beyond expectation, in ſo much as I
conceive we might have maintained the place ſtill if
we had bin furniſhed with Powder and ſhot, but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſpent in a manner all our whole ſtore of Bullet,
Match, and Powder, I adviſed with the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and by generall conſent it was though fit, to
riſe with our Forces, and march to <hi>Cawood;</hi> and
<hi>Selby,</hi> to ſecure thoſe places, and there receive ſupplies
of Ammunition and men, which was accordingly
done, and now I am at <hi>Selby,</hi> with part of the Army,
and the reſt with Captaine <hi>Hotham</hi> at <hi>Cawood;</hi> And
yeſterday I ſent my ſonne Sir Thomas <hi>Fairfax</hi> with
five Companies of Foot, and two Troops of Horſe
to <hi>Leedes,</hi> intending he ſhould continue there to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
that place, and the other Clothing townes, againſt
the Earle of <hi>New-Caſtells</hi> forces, if it were poſſible;
But the Enemies forces were laid ſo ſtrong in the
way, as he could not paſſe, ſo he onely beat up a
Quarter of the Enemies in a ſmall Village, tooke
five Priſoners, and retreated to <hi>Selby.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus my Lords I have briefly repreſented the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this Army at preſent, which I muſt confeſſe I
feare will very ſuddenly grow worſe, if not utterly
<pb facs="tcp:52429:4"/>
broken up, and that eſpecially for want of money, I
having not above a weekes pay provided before hand,
and no viſible meanes left to raiſe maintenance for
them unleſſe I ſhould give the Soldiers free quarter
upon the Countrey, a cure in my conceit as dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
as the diſeaſe, and peradventure not poſſible to
be effected, If the Enemy be ſtill maſter of the field,
and cut off our men as they goe abroad to levy Suſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which they may doe, and yet not able to beat
up our Quarters. I have hitherto ſupported this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
by the Loanes and Contributions for the moſt
part of the pariſhes of <hi>Leedes Hallifax</hi> and <hi>Bradford,</hi>
and ſome other ſmall Clothing-townes adjacent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the only wel affected people of the Country, who
I much feare may now ſuffer by this Popiſh Army of
the <hi>North</hi> meerely for their good affection to the
Religion and Publique Liberty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Out of the reſt of the
Countrey I was not able to draw any conſiderable
helpe, the Enemy having Garriſons in ſo many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
who threatned to ruine any that ſhould aſſiſt the
Parliament and the cauſe with mony or rather helps.
My Lords in ſum the State of this Countrey is
thus, The Enemy is mighty, and maſter of the field,
plentifully ſupplyed from his Majeſty and the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
and malignant party, with moneys and all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries,
the well affected party as now it is divided
not conſiderable, the ayds from <hi>Lincolnſhire Darby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi>
and other Counties very uncertaine, the want of
moneyes here, ſuch as will force us to diſband with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
10 dayes, and if the Enemy become abſolute Maſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> they will force contribution, and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours
from the Countrey, which will raiſe a very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable

ſupplyes of men, and money as may Enable me to
goe foreward in the ſervice, which I ſhall not faile to
doe with a conſtant fidelity. Your Lordſhips have
heretofore aſſignd two thouſand Pounds, for our
ſuccour; but the moſt part of it is ſtill at <hi>London</hi>
where it lyes for want of Exchange or convoy, and
therefore what ſhall now be ſent, muſt come either
by ſufficient convoy of Forces by Land, or
elſe by ſea to Hull, and ſo hither to mee: the
Scottiſh Officers are now come hither, yeſterday,
but now we are ſo ſtreightned, that wee can have no
men reſort to us, to put under command, nor have
we money to pay them. The further relation of theſe
Affaires, <hi>I</hi> ſhall leave to Captaine <hi>Hatcher,</hi> who
