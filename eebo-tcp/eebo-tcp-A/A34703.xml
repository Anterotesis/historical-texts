         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of himself and people, he levied 80000. men

out of the Shires of this Kingdome. To withdraw
his forces from <hi>France,</hi> in the thirteenth of his

that suffered from the same motive the like

they pretended, do now teach, as a <hi>Maxime</hi> of
their Mysterie and our State, That the directest
way either to wealth or security is by <hi>Rapine</hi>
and Spoile: and to cloake their own ends
pretend the common good; as if the State
stood by their affections, when in truth they
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:66106:14"/>
themselves cannot fish but in <hi>aqua turbida</hi> in
troubled waters; &amp; therefore would have <hi>Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium

but to keep warm &amp; awake their own humours.</p>
            <p>THe last motive from Necessity is,<note place="margin">Exhausting of the people no Necessity but Danger.</note> the ease
Warre bringeth to a surcharged State. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
it seemeth <hi>Warre</hi> but as the Sinck, and
Souldiers but as the Corruptions of Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weals;
whereas besides the inevitable use of the
one, and the noble condition of the other, (an
Errour in the argument) Nature doth never op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
further by increase, then she again dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chargeth.
The brest of the Mother she enableth
to nourish up as many as the Womb shall <hi>uno
partu</hi> at one birth ever bring forth; proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to the number of the children the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their Strength and Appetites. It is then
accession of our own that may surcharge; for
Parents by such indulgent admission may soon
famish whom in Motherly affection they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to cherish.</p>
            <p>But admitting the former ground, whether by
this way of waste we be ever able and at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to gage the Issue (when such elective power
is left to him onely <hi>qui suis stat viribus, non a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieno
pendet arbitrio,</hi> who stands by his own
strength, and not at the pleasure of another) is
considerable; since to begin <hi>cuivis licet, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponere
cum victores volunt,</hi> is easy for any man,
but the laying down will be at the conquerous
pleasure. For the wasting of our people in am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
Enterprizes (as that for an <hi>Empire</hi> by
<hi>Constantine</hi> in <hi>France</hi>) left this land as a prey
to the barbarous Frontiers,<note n="a" place="margin">Beda Hist. Eccl. lib. 1.</note>

Inventutsi alacritatespoliata,</hi> being left
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:66106:14"/>
naked of Souldiery, and robbed of the choicest
flower of youth. And when we were tied to make
good our undertaking in <hi>France,</hi> the waste of
our people was so great, that to supply extremity
we took <hi>purgamenta urbium,</hi> the dreggs of
townes, (as <hi>Curtius</hi> saith of <hi>Alexander;</hi>)<note n="a" place="margin">Ex Rot. Franciae an. 22. E. 1.</note> Need
hiring the <hi>Bankrupts</hi> by protection, as in 22.
of <hi>Edward</hi> the first; and enforcing, against the
rule of justice, the Judges to put <hi>Placita eorum

sunt,</hi> Pleas in the behalf of such as were to go
in the Kings service. And as <hi>Tacitus</hi> of a decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Majesty saith, <hi>emunt militem, non legunt,</hi>
they buy their Souldiers rather then make choice
of them; we made purchase of generall Pardons
of all that were <hi>Utlegati, Banniti, aut de Felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niis
indictati, si cum Rege transitare voluerint,</hi>
out-lawed, excommunicated, or indicted of Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony,
in case they would go over with the King.
As in the same year of the former King and in
the year after were discharged out of all Prisons
in the Realm to the number of 97 notorious
Malefactours.<note n="b" place="margin">Ex Rot. Original. in Arch. The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saur.</note> And in the 18. of <hi>Edward</hi> the

ill way of life must needs make them ready
for any mischief. In the end of this King last
remembred, and entrance of his Heir <hi>Richard</hi>
the second, the State began to be sensible of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming
Issue; which not lying in the Kings
power (now as the strength of <hi>France,</hi> set on

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:66106:15"/>

was urged to him in Parliament<note n="a" place="margin">Ex Rot. Par. anno 7. R. 2.</note> 7. of his reign,
as an <hi>errour</hi> in his Government: whereto he
answered, that they ought not to lay the cause

Warres descended unto him. And the <hi>Chauncel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor</hi>
4. of <hi>Henry</hi> the 4. declared publickly in the
Higher House, that by the mischance of Warre
and want of reasonable <hi>Peace,</hi> (for I use the
words of the Roll) occasioned by dissension
and private desire, the flower of <hi>Chivalry</hi> and
Rock of <hi>Nobless</hi> within the Realm was in a

            </q>
            <p>And the whole State by warre had been thus
subverted, had not God as a mean raised that
King.</p>
            <p>But since the end of mans creation is not for
the Slaughter,<note place="margin">Better to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burden the state by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony then War.</note> nor education of Armes to make
men Castawayes; the course most answerable
either to <hi>Charity,</hi> or <hi>Example,</hi> (for <hi>Rome</hi> did by

transplant that we may best spare. In <hi>Ireland</hi>

he was left in, and the Territories he inherited
beyond Sea could not be maintained, except the

of the goods of the Commons the like entirely,
and six times the half, twelve times a fifteenth,
and six times the Moiety: And had <hi>anno</hi> 21.
granted one Tenth to him, and a 15. and a half
of either of them yearly for term of life. From
out the Boroughs and Cities thrice a full Tenth,
and once a Moiety. Out of all Merchandises he
received three years 6<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. in the pound, and once
twelve pence. And for every Tunne of Wine,
and such Commodities, for 2. yeares 6<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. doubling
it for as many, and trebling it for three yeares

King advanced to 22. shil. 8<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. which singly for

the Sack. The summe of one of these Subsidies

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:66106:24"/>
of the goods of the Clergie he had 8. Tenths

By the poll or heads of all his people from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove

               <p>To furnish his journey for <hi>Ireland</hi> he took

                  <hi>Hinc factus

to be hated by his People, saith the Bishop of
<hi>London.</hi> And so it seemed: For at his deposing,
it was one of the objected Articles against
him.</p>
               <p>He the first yeare of his Reign imposed upon
his Subjects, as formerly his Ancestours had
done, a personall service <hi>ab anno primo,</hi> That
all the Clergy should array <hi>Armis &amp; Equis
competentibus,</hi> with serviceable Horses and
Armes, from the age of 16. to 60. <hi>et eos in Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenis

be entred into Regiments and Companyes.
And two yeares after commanded all accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their Tenures by service to fit themselves
<hi>Equis &amp; Armis,</hi> with Horse and Armes to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the wars. But these the courses of elder
times were about this time much altered, and
the King for the most part ever supplied in his
wars by contract with the Nobility and Gentry,
to serve him with so many men, and so long,
and at such a rate as he and they by Indenture
accorded; of which there are in the <hi>Pell</hi> plenty
yet remaining. Thus under grievous burdens
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:66106:25"/>
did the State labour continually all his time;
for his Treasury being wastfully emptied, was,
as <hi>Tacitus</hi> saith of <hi>Tiberius,</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Tacit. lib. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Scelere replen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum,</hi>
to be filled some ill way; by which he
meant intolerable racking of the people. Hence
was it that often in this Kings time<note n="b" place="margin">Rot. Parl. annis 3, 4, &amp; 5. R. 2.</note> the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
humbly beg some ease of the insupportable
Tallages.</p>
               <p>But he little regarding the tears or groans of
his heartlesse People, answered them as <hi>an.</hi> 4.
That their Petition and his Honour could not
consist together.<note n="c" place="margin">Rot. Parl. anno. 1. H. 4. n. 32.</note> They again plead extreme
poverty, in barre of further relief; complaining
that good mony was transported, and the State
enforced to use base; and that the price of Wooll
by warrs (to their utter impoverishing) was
fallen, and that the Kings want was onely the
ill government of his Revenues; and therefore
crave to have his present Officers removed: and
very hardly would be drawn any more to taxe
themselves, but conditionally, and with this
Limitation, That their mony should be received,
expended, and accompted for to themselves, and
by Treasures of their own election; and are
content to lend in the end; loading this poor
Kings dejected Fortune with the reproachfull
weight of these their many Burthens.</p>

                  <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth in 13.<note place="margin">Henry 4.</note> yeares out of the land

thrice a Tenth, and twice a Moiety; as also of

                  <note place="margin">Henry 5.</note> in

thirds onely of Staple wares; a Subsidy once for
4. yeares, and after for life: three shillings
Tunnage, and 12<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. Poundage for the like terms
as the former Subsidies. Thrice he had the Tenth
of his Clergie. And in the eighth of his Reign,
when the <hi>Chancellour</hi> bewailed to him in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
the Feeblenesse and Poverty of the
People by reason of wars and scarcity of mony,
he (who of as many attempts as he undertook,
<hi>totidem fecit Monumenta victoriae,</hi> raised him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
so many Monuments of Victory,) yet for
redresse and ease of those miseries (as <hi>Livy</hi>
saith of an excellent Souldier) <hi>Pacem voluit

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:66106:26"/>
because he knew he could overcome. And left
in the 9. yeare of his Reign a peaceable succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and <hi>Heire, nimium felix malo suo,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Henry 6.</note> too
happy to his own undoing, as the event proved.
For retaining nothing <hi>ex paterna Majestate
praeter speciem nominis,</hi> of his Father's Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
more then the specious Name of a Great
King, by Fear and Facility he laid the way
open to his Factious Ambitious kindred, to
work themselves into popular Favour, and
himself into Contempt: which was soon done
by leading the easy King by Expence into Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity.
For besides the Resumptions he took of
his own and Fathers Grants, (which was of
purpose plotted to make a consumption of Duty
and Affection towards him) he out of the old
inheritance of his Subjects exacted 6<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. in the
pound <hi>anno</hi> 14. and doubled twice that valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
not onely on all lands purchased from the
entrance of <hi>Edward</hi> the first, but of all Free-hold
and Coppy-hold under 200. <hi>l.</hi> and two in
twenty of all above. He further imposed first
6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> shil. 8<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. and then 20. shil. upon every Knights
Fee. Out of the goods of the Commons he had
6. Tenths, whereof one for 3. yeares, besides 3.

18. shil. From the first purchase of it by <hi>Edward</hi>
the 3. untill the losse thereof by <hi>Queen Mary,</hi>
it was ever a perpetuall issue of the Treasure of
this Land, which might in continuance have
rather grown to be a burthen of Danger to us,
then any Fort of Security. For from the waste
of money, which is <hi>Nervus Reipublicae,</hi> the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
of a Common-wealth, as <hi>Ulpian</hi> saith, we
may conclude with <hi>Tacitus, Dissolutionem Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perii
docet, si fructus quibus Respub. sustinetur
diminuantur,</hi> it foreshews the ruine of an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
if that be impaired which should be the
sustenance of the Common-wealth. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was not the worst opinion (at such time
as the Captivity of <hi>Francis</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
<note n="b" place="margin">Ex litera Archiep. Cant. Card. Wolsey.</note> 
                  <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. to put off that Kingdome,
although in the close <hi>major pars vicit melio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem,</hi>
the greater party out-voted the better,) that
to gain any thing in <hi>France</hi> would be more
chargeable then profitable, and the keeping
more then the enjoying. The issue was in <hi>Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay,
Bullen,</hi> and this Town manifest. Besides
the jealousy that Nation ever held over our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes
and their own liberty. For as <hi>Graecia li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bera
esse non potuit dum Philippus Graeciae Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedes
tenuit, Greece</hi> could never be free so long
as <hi>Philip</hi> had the Fetters of <hi>Greece</hi> in his cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stody;
so as long as by retention of <hi>Callis</hi> we
had an easy descent into, and convenient place
to trouble the Country, a Fetter to intangle
them, they neither had assurance of their own
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:66106:36"/>
quiet, nor we of their Amity. And it was not
the least Argument from <hi>Conveniencie</hi> in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of <hi>Callis</hi> (after the 8 yeares expired of
Re-delivery) used by the <hi>Chancellour</hi> of <hi>France,</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Ex litera Thomae Smith Secret: anno 1567. 3. Maii.</note> That we should gain much more in assured
peace, which we could never have so long as
we were Lords of that Town, then by any bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
it did or could yield us. It was never but a
Pike and Quarrell between the two Realms:
For upon every light displeasure, either Princes
would take by and by to <hi>Callis,</hi> and make war
there. <hi>God</hi> hath made a separation naturall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt

               <p>But a little more to inform the weight of these
Charges, it is not amisse to touch (by way of

To our Lord the King of <hi>France,</hi> as during the

did in all our Letters and publick Contracts

the dignity of a Soveraign, is no question of

now we have not. The coast of <hi>Normandy</hi> was
our own, by which we might enter the midst
of <hi>France.</hi> And <hi>Edward</hi> 3. when he intended
to annoy the East part, sided with <hi>Montfort</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Charles de Bloys,</hi> whom he invested with
the <hi>Dutchie</hi> of <hi>Britain,</hi> that so he might have
there an easy footing. Thus by leave of his
Confederats in <hi>Flanders</hi> he had safe entrance
for all his Army to invade the other side, and
a sure retreat, when upon any occasion he
would come back, as he did to <hi>Antwerp.</hi> And
wheresoever any army may have a quiet descent,
the greatest difficultie is overcome; for the rest
consisteth in <hi>Chance,</hi> wherein Fortune is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

most, but a proprietary interest in part; and
therefore had reason to give aide and Armes
to such a Confederate as did by a diversive war

that State. But now growing into <hi>Spain,</hi> they
need no such assurance in the one; and we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most

he is absolute, and that we be equally devoid of
demand, neither having against the other any
Titles. <hi>Next,</hi> for that the entercourse of Trade
is more reciprocall between us then <hi>France,</hi> and
our Amity founded upon long love and old
blood. To this may be made a two-fold answer,
from the change of their Dispositions: <hi>First,</hi>
for that they never assist any now, but to make
themselves Master of their State. Thus ended
they the strife between the Competitors of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugall.</hi>
And when they were called into <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi>
by the <hi>Queen</hi> against the <hi>French,</hi> they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined
with her Adversary, and divided the
Kingdome. And after upon the River of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillon,</hi>
under their Leader <hi>Gonsalves,</hi> taking an
advantage, they defeated the whole Army of
the <hi>French,</hi> holding ever since that entire King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
themselves. For <hi>Spain</hi> will admit neither
Equallity nor Felowship, since upon Union of
so many Kingdomes, and famous Discoveries,
they begun to affect a fifth <hi>Monarchie. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi>
that the late <hi>hostilitie</hi> between them and
us hath drawn so much blood, as all formes of
ancient Amity are quite washt away: and as
<hi>Paterculus</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Paterculus.</note> saith of <hi>Carthage</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> so may

               <p>BEsides these locall considerations, there will

after that <hi>Bourbon</hi> had advanced his Army and

Kingdome is, all great directions move from one
place, commonly from one man, as the Heart in

be so placed, that as well Intelligence as Dispatch
may safely passe with indifferency and assured
Speed: And those Forms are most quick and
easy in motion, whose extremes are all equally

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough we see that naturall causes
produce sometimes contrary effects,
that the Sun which draws up the
Clouds can also scatter them, that
the same Wind both lights and blow's out the
taper, that Vipers serve for wholesome medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and Scorpions carry about them an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote
to their own poison: it is not so neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
in morall and politick affairs, wherein that
which is once ill, is alwayes accounted such;
from whence is begot in us that quality which
we call <hi>Experience,</hi> whereby wise men are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed
to judge of present and future actions
by those that are past. Which is the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
whereupon all Monarchies and Republicks
have established the Maxims of their subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence,
and found out both what they ought to
follow and what to avoid.</p>

The Charity which <hi>France</hi> hath testified to
pacify our differences is so great that it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
incredible, so unseasonable that it is su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected,
and so contrary to their former proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
that it is quite otherwayes understood.
Philosophers say, we cannot passe from one
extremity to another without some mean; I
cannot see by what steps they are come to this
perfect goodness, nor what good <hi>Genius</hi> can
have made them in an instant so good friends
of such dangerous neighbours to us. I will
passe my censure upon nothing, yet let me
have the liberty to judge of all. I find so
great a wonder in this change, that I find a
conflict in my self to believe it. It is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
marvell, that those who have for so long
a time beheld all <hi>Europe</hi> in a flame, and could
not be moved by the bloud and destruction of
so many people to cast thereon one drop of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
should now have their bowells so tender as
to compassionate the dissensions arising in a
corner of the world which hath alwayes bin
fatall to them; That those who have made it
their chiefest interest to divide us, should now
make it their glory to reunite us; That those
who place their rest in our troubles, should
now apply their cares for our repose; and that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:66106:52"/>
after they have cast us down headlong, they
should reach us a plank for to come ashore.
Let the wise Reader here (whilst I determine
nothing) allow me at least a little distrust;
it is the Mother of Safety. The <hi>Trojans,</hi> who
could not be overcome by Armes, perish't by
a pledge of peace. All the <hi>French</hi> civilityes are
faire and good; but in the bottome.</p>
               <q>Quicquid id est, timeo Gallos, &amp; dona fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes.</q>
               <p>Let us see what reasons can oblige them to
interest themselves so passionately in our agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Is it Religion? surely no; for that which
they professe is contrary to that of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
and the little Charity they have for
their own, ought not to perswade us that they
have much for ours. Is it for the inclination
they have to peace? surely no; for if they
esteemed it a benefit, they would seek it first
for themselves. It is perhaps for an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement
of their obligations to us in the late
warres, and for the assistance we gave to those
of <hi>Rochel.</hi> I, this would be truely Christian
indeed, to render us good for evill. They will
say that they are the bands of blood and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentage,
which bind them to the <hi>Queen;</hi> and
yet they have let the Mother beg her subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:66106:53"/>
and retreat among strangers, which she
could not find with them, and having beheld
her without pitty and succour in her greatest
extremities, they advise to offer her a remedy
upon the declining of her ill. But if this be the
reason of their admittance, I conceive them no
lawfull nor indifferent Mediators, since they
are so much concern'd in one of the parties.
They will whisper us in the eare, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe
is to pacify us, and to ingage us in a
league with them against the <hi>Spaniard;</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
at the same time they designe Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadours
for <hi>Munster</hi> to endeavour a peace with
him. O, we should wrong them very much to
believe it, though they might seem in an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
to desire it of us; They are too gallant
spirited to pretend it, they know that we are
better advised then to serve them to pull their
Chesnut out of the fire; that a body recovering
health from a long sicknesse ought not to expose
it self to a violent agitation; that the State will
find it self loaden with debts, and the Subject
exhausted by Contributions; that we ought to
preferre the evident profit of traffick before the
uncertain vanity of a conquest; that Iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies
being not yet removed, nor aemulations
supprest, all kind of arming would be suspected
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:66106:53"/>
by the State, fearing least some under pretense
of a forrain warre might study private re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
or the oppression of the publick liberty;
&amp; that in the end it will be our gain to see them
deal with <hi>Spain,</hi> and to make our advantage of
their troubles, or not to meddle at all with
them, unlesse by adding secretly (according to
the revolution of affairs) a little weight to
them that shall be found the lighter. If then it
be none of these motives, it remains that it
must be either Generosity, or deceit. O <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerosity</hi>
(that hast so long since withdrawn
thy self to heaven, there to keep company with
the faire <hi>Astraea,</hi> or rather, who wer't buried in
<hi>France</hi> in the Sepulchre of Monsieur <hi>Gonin</hi>)
is it possible that thou shouldst be risen again,
or that <hi>France</hi> should have recall'd thee with
her exiles since the death of her King; and
that the first labour she should put thee to
should be in favour of <hi>England,</hi> against whom
but few dayes since she shewed such violent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentments,
for an offence received by a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
violation of the treaties which had past
between us? Truely if it be she, we must reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
her with extraordinary respects; but
before we give her the Honours due unto her,
we must know her, for feare of Idolatry in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:66106:54"/>
adoring her masque for her self, or embracing
a cloud in stead of a Goddesse. Let us give
a thrust with our launce into the <hi>Trojan</hi> horse,
to see if there be no ambush within.</p>
               <p>In walking lately with some <hi>French</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
(as this nation is free enough of their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course)
a word escaped from one of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
without making reflexion (as I think) of
what Countrey I was, That amongst their
Prophets there was one which said, That <hi>the
Conquest of England was promised to their
young King.</hi> This thought cast into the aire
though inconsideratly, seemed to me very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable;
and having given me an occasion to
reflect upon all things both past and present, it
served me as a light to guide me in the obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of this Labyrinth, upon which before I
had reasoned but superficially. From thence
being returned to my lodging, I opened acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
a book of Monsieur <hi>de Rohan,</hi> intitled <hi>The
interest of the Princes of Christendome,</hi> and I
fell presently upon a passage where he said, That
one of the surest wayes to make ones self Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of a State, is to interpose and make himself
arbiter of its differences. I had no need of any
other <hi>Oedipus</hi> to expound to me the riddle of
the Prophesy, these first motives of suspicion
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:66106:54"/>
having cast me into more profound thoughts, I
revolved in my mind how <hi>France</hi> had managed
the whole business, both before &amp; since the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of our troubles, and weighed all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
of this Ambassage. Why such a
solemne Ambassage in a time when all things
seem most exasperated and furthest from ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation?
Why then not sooner, while dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
were not yet irreconcileable between
the two parties? Why such a warlike Prince,
who is not experienced in the affaires of this
Kingdome, to manage a negotiation of a peace
the most nice and intricate that the world at
this time affords? Why at the same time levying
of Souldiers in <hi>Normandy,</hi> when all the other
troops are in their quarters? Why therefore
should they supply one of the parties with mony,
when they come to act the persons of media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours;
if not to cast wood and oyle into the flame?
Why at the same time an Agent in <hi>Scotland,</hi> who
propounds to them openly a League with <hi>France?</hi>
Why begin they onely to turn their cares upon
<hi>England,</hi> when they are upon the point of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
a peace with <hi>Spain?</hi> May not we
well judge that it is to prepare themselves for
a new employment? since they themselves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
that their boiling and unquiet temper hath
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:66106:55"/>
need of continuall exercise, and that the onely
means to prevent troubles at home, is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
to furnish them with matter whereupon
to evacuate their choler abroad. Why doth
onely <hi>France</hi> afford us this so suddain and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected
Charity, after all the fresh wounds
which bleed yet among them because of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion
of the <hi>Capuchins,</hi> after the continuall
cares she hath taken for so many years to lay
the foundation of our troubles by the secret ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiations
of the Marquis of <hi>Blainville,</hi> by the
intriques of the cardinal of <hi>Richelieu</hi> with
<hi>Buckingham,</hi> by the long plots in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
and by the open sollicitations of the Marquis
<hi>de la Fert?</hi> by all which they sometimes incited
the Kings ministers to make him independent
and absolute, offering to that purpose their assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
and anone they sollicited the States to
shake off the yoak of servitude, finally they
transformed themselves into a thousand diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
shapes, till having plunged us deep enough
in the gulf, they then call back their Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage,
to give in appearance some satisfaction to
the King, but in truth because his commission
was expired. May not we well conclude from all
this, that they will now reape the fruits they have
so carefully sown and cultivated amongst us?
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:66106:55"/>
From these considerations falling insensibly on
those of <hi>England,</hi> what need (said I in my
self) have we of the intermeddling of stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers?
are they more versed in our interests then
our selves? can they afford more expedients?
are they more sensible of our miseries then those
that suffer them? Is it to exhort us, or to
constrain us? the first is superfluous; the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
dangerous. It must needs be that either in
the one case they think to go beyond us in wit, or
in the other to master us by force. If peace be
profitable for us, have we any need either of a
Master to make us know our advantage, or of
an Oratour to perswade us to it? If it be hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to us, we ought to give them thanks for
their advice, but follow that which is better. If
the peace be feasible, why should we leave the
glory of it to others? if impossible, why loose
time in making vain propositions? why should
we acquaint strong and ambitious neighbours,
and trust the <hi>Philistins</hi> with the secret of our
force? Must <hi>England,</hi> that hath in times past
compelled <hi>France</hi> to purchase peace, be now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
to beg it of her? that one of the most
considerable and flourishing Monarchies of the
world should serve for matter of sport to the
vanity of the <hi>French,</hi> and be the first upon
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:66106:56"/>
whom they exercise the Title they give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
of being Arbiters of Christendome?
What Counsel then shall we follow in this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter?
That of good and wise Nature, who
having separated us from all other Nations by a
vast and deep trench, silently teacheth us, that
the principle of our subsistence is in our selves,
and that we ought not to submit our govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the arbitrement of others.</p>
