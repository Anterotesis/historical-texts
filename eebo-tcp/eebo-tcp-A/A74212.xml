         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A PETITION DELIVERED IN TO THE LORDS SPIRITVALL AND TEMPORALL, BY SIR THOMAS ASTON, BARONET, FROM THE COVNTY PALATINE OF <hi>CHESTER</hi> CONCERNING <hi>EPISCOPACY;</hi> To the High and Honourable Court of Parliament.</head>
            <head type="sub">The Nobilitie, Knights, Gentry, Miniſters, Freeholders, and Inhabitants of the County Palatine of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> whoſe names are ſubſcribed in the ſeverall Schedules hereunto annexed.</head>
            <opener>Humbly ſhew;</opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat whereas divers Petitions have lately beene carryed about this Countie, againſt the preſent forme of Church government, (and the hands of many perſons of ordinary quality ſollicited to the ſame, with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to be preſented to this Honourable Aſſembly) which wee conceiving not ſo much to ayme at re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation as abſolute innovation of government, and ſuch as muſt give a great advantage to the adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of our Religion, wee held it our dutie to diſavow them all.</p>
            <p>And humbly pray, that wee incurre no miſcenſure, if any ſuch clamours have (without our privitie) aſſum'd the name of the County.</p>
            <p>Wee, as others, are ſenſible of the common grievances of the Kingdome, and have juſt cauſe to rejoyce at, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge with thankfulneſſe, the pious care which is already taken for the ſuppreſſing of the growth of Popery, the better ſupply of able Miniſters, and the remooving of all innovation; and wee doubt not but in your great Wiſdomes, you will regulate the rigour of Ecclefiaſticall Courts, to ſuit with the temper of our Lawes, and the nature of free-men.</p>
            <p>Yet when we conſider, that Biſhops were inſtituted in the time of the Apoſtles; That they were the great lights of the Church in all the firſt generall Counſells; That ſo many of them ſowed the ſeeds of Religion in their bloods, and reſcued Chriſtianitie from utter extirpation in the primitive Heathen perſecutions; That to them we owe the redemption of the puritie of the Goſpell wee now profeſſe from Romiſh corruption; That many of them for the propagation of the truth, became ſuch glorious Martyrs; That divers of them (lately and) yet living with us, have beene ſo great aſſertors of our Religion againſt its common enemy of Rome; And that their government hath been ſo long approved, ſo oft eſtabliſhed by the common and ſtatute-lawes of this Kingdome; And as yet nothing in their doctrine (generally taught) diſſonant from the Word of God, or the Articles ratified by Law. In this caſe to call their gouernment a perpetuall vaſſalage, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable bondage; And <hi>(prima facie &amp; inaudita alter a parte)</hi> to pray the preſent removall of them, or (as in ſome of their Petitions) to ſeeke the utter diſſolution and ruine of their offices (as Antichriſtian) wee cannot conceive to reliſh of juſtice or charitie, nor can wee joyne with them.</p>
            <p>But on the contrary, when wee conſider the tenor of ſuch writings, as in the name of Petitions, are ſpread amongſt the common people; the tenents preached publiquely in Pulpits, and the contents of many printed Pamphlers, ſwarming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us; all of them dangerouſly exciting a diſobedience to the eſtabliſhed forme of government, and their ſeverall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timations of the deſire of the power of the keyes, and that their Congregations may execute Eccleſiaſticall cenſures with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in themſelves, wee cannot but expreſſe our juſt feares, that their deſire is to introduce an abſolute innovation of Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Government, whereby wee who are now governed by the Canon and Civill Lawes, diſpenſed by twenty-ſix Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries (eaſily reſponſall to Parliaments for any deviation from the rule of Law) conceive wee ſhould become expoſed to the meere arbitrary government of a numerous Presbytery, who together with their ruling Elders, will ariſe to neere forty thouſand Church Governours, and with their adherents, muſt needs beare ſo great a ſway in the Common-wealth, that if future inconvenience ſhall be found in that government, wee humbly offer to conſideration, how theſe ſhall be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible by Parliaments, how conſiſtent with a Monarchy, and how dangerouſly conducible to an Anarchy, which wee have juſt cauſe to pray againſt, as fearing the conſequences would prove the utter loſſe of learning and Lawes, which muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily produce an extirmination of Nobilitie, Gentry, and order, if not of Religion.</p>
            <div type="petition_proper">
               <p>With what vehemency of ſpirit, theſe things are proſecuted, and how plauſibly ſuch popular infuſions ſpread as incline to a paritie, wee held it our dutie to repreſent to this Honourable Aſſembly; And humbly pray, That ſome ſuch preſent courſe be taken, as in your Wiſdomes ſhall be thought fit to ſuppreſſe the future diſperſing of ſuch dangerous diſcontents amongſt the common people. Wee having great cauſe to feare, that of all the diſtempers that at preſent threaten the well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of this State, there is none more worthy the mature and grave conſideration of this Honourable Aſſembly, then to ſtop the Torrent of ſuch ſpirits before they ſwell beyond the bounds of Government: Then wee doubt not but his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty perſevering in his gracious inclination to heare the complaints, and relieve the grievances of his Subjects in frequent Parliaments, it will ſo unite the head and the body, ſo indiſſolubly cement the affections of his people to our Royall So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yeraigne, that without any other change of Government, he can never want revenue nor wee juſtice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wee have preſumed to annex a Coppy of a Petition (or Libell) diſperſed, and certaine poſitions preacht in this County, which wee conceive imply matter of dangerous conſequence to the peace both of Church and State. All which wee humbly ſubmit to your great Judgements, praying they may be read.</hi>
