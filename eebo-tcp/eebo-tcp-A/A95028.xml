            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HAT the Petitioners doe much rejoyce in the happy Concurrence of both Houſes of Parliament, as in other things, ſo eſpecially, in that moſt neceſſary <hi>Ordinance</hi> touching the <hi>Militia</hi> of this Kingdome, and Dominion of <hi>Wales;</hi> VVhereunto the Petitioners doe moſt humbly and cheerfully ſubmit, for the ſafety of His Majeſty, the Parliament and Kingdome: For the ordering whereof many preſſing Petitions from moſt parts of the Kingdome have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, in this time of imminent Dangers, proceeding from the bloody Councells of Papiſts and others, ill affected to the honour, peace and proſperity of our moſt gracious King, and his Kingdomes.</p>
            <p>And the Petitioners doe likewiſe humbly returne all poſſible thanks unto this Honourable Houſe, for the great honour and high favour vouchſafed, in giving them leave to nominate the Perſons to whom the <hi>Militia</hi> of this City ſhould be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; And for accepting and approving of the Nomination and return made to this Honourable Houſe, by the Petitioners on that behalfe.</p>
            <p>But this their joy is much diſtured and interrupted by an untrue, unadviſed, and dangerous Petition, intituled, <hi>The humle Petition of the Citizens of London, whoſe names are under written,</hi> directed and delivered in <hi>February</hi> laſt, <hi>To the Lords and Commons aſſembled in Parliament;</hi> And ſince publiſhed in Print, with this Title, <hi>The humble Petition of the Citizens of London:</hi> Thereby to publiſh it through the Kingdome, as the Petition of all the Citizens: Wherein is ſet forth (as appeareth by one of thoſe Printed Copies annexed) that <hi>the ordering of the Armes of London hath time out of mind, been annexed to the Maioralty of the ſaid City; That the conferring thereof upon others would reflect upon the government and Cuſtomes of this City, granted by the great Charter of</hi> England, <hi>and confirmed by divers Acts and Charters ſince that time; and which every Freeman of the ſaid City is by the Oath of his freedome bound to maintaine to the utmoſt of his power; And that ſuch Alteration in the ancient Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment might breed great d<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Nor this alone, but the Petitioners are yet more deeply wounded and grieved, by the preſumptuous boldneſſe of the Publiſhers of the ſaid Petition in Print, by joyning therwith His Majeſties Anſwer and denyall, Intituled <hi>His Majeſties Meſsage to both Houſes of Parliament, February</hi> 28 1641. Which Anſwer (as the Petitiones humbly conceive) was grounded upon the ſaid Petition, and miſinformation of ſome perſons, ill affected to His Majeſty and to the City, Who have thereby, and otherwiſe, often endeavoured to make diviſions betwixt the King and the Parliament; betwixt the Parliament and the City; and betwixt the Citizens among themſelves, to the intollerable abuſe of his ſacred Majeſty, and of all his loyall Subjects.</p>
            <p>And they verily beleeve, that this bold publiſhing in Print, of the ſaid Petition, and his Majeſties Meſſage (which ſhortly after followed the exhibiting of the ſaid Petition) together in one printed paper, was purpoſely done, wickedly and ſeditiouſly, to make diviſions as aforeſaid, to beget an opinion throughout the Kingdome, that the City of <hi>London</hi> doth not intend to conforme unto, but complaine of, and oppoſe the aforeſaid Ordinance, and to make the ſaid Petition a deſperate preſident to the reſt of the Kingdome, to doe the like; Thereby to hinder the cheerfull, needfull, lawfull, and unanimous Concurrence of the Kingdome, in yeedling due, full, and timely obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the ſaid <hi>Ordinance.</hi>
