            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The report of one Souls Conversion to God, and of the Reformation of one Family, City, or Church, and of the noble Operations of the blessed Spirit, by which he brings up Souls to God, and conquereth the World, the Flesh, and the Devil; the Heavenly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications of God unto Sinners, for their Vivification, Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination, and holy Love to God, and to his Image, are so far better than the Stories of these grand Murderers, and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, and their great Robberies, and Murders, called <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests,</hi> as the Diagnosticks of Health are than those of Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: Or, as it is more pleasant to read of the Building of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, than of their ruins; or of the Cures of a Physitian, than of the hurts done by Robberies and Frays; yea, of the Healing of Immortal Souls, than of the over-hasty destroying of mens Bodies, which would quickly turn to Dust of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, if these valiant Murderers had but the patience to stay the time.</p>
                     <p>And among all parts of Church-History, the Lives of Wise and Holy Men, do seem to be not least <hi>Useful</hi> and <hi>Delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;</hi> (which is the reason why Satan hath so marvelously and successfully bestird himself, to corrupt this part of History with so many impudent lies in the Popish Legends, as might render all such Narratives afterwards Contemptible and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible, and might destroy the Ends:) Therefore is the Sacred Scripture so much Historical; and the Gospel it self is not a Volumn of well composed Orations, or a Systeme, or Encu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clopaedia of the Sciences and Arts; nor yet a great Volumn of unnecessary Laws; but the History of the Life and Death of Christ, and the wonderous Works of Himself, and his Spirit in his Servants, and a Record of those brief Laws and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, which are needful to the Holiness and Happiness of Man.</p>
                     <p>In the Lives of Holy Men we see God's Image, and the Beauties of Holiness, not only in Precept, but in Reality and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65560:8"/>
Practice; not <hi>Pictured,</hi> but in the <hi>Substance:</hi> And though the Precepts and Rules be more perfect in their kind, as wanting no Degree or Part, yet the real Impress and Holiness in the Soul, is that living Image of God, which is the end of the former, and of which the Scripture is but the Instrumental cause. And <hi>Holiness</hi> in visible Realities, is apt to affect the World more deeply, than in Portraiture and Precept only. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we find that Satan and his Instruments, are used to do that against the Scriptures exemplified in the Godly, which they have not done against the Scriptures in themselves: They can bear the bare Precepts of a perfect Rule, who cannot bear the very imperfect practice of them in a Holy Life. Many have burnt Martyrs, that could endure good Books. Living Holiness most exciteth Malice! Besides, that the best of men have Imperfections, which may be a pretence for Detraction, Slander, and Persecution, when the Sacred Rule is not so boldly to be accused, till they are ripened in Malignity and Audacity.</p>
                     <p>Many a one can read with Reverence the Life of a dead Saint, who will neither imitate nor indure the Living. And I doubt not but many can bear the Narrative of this holy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons Life, who could not have endured to see themselves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in the Exercises of his present Holy Zeal.</p>
                     <p>And yet it is not to be denied, but that Humane Nature yet containeth such Principles and Inclinations, as give an honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable testimony to goodness; For the exercises of prudent, impartial, equal Vertue, and eminent holiness in a Heavenly Life, and in the joyful Hopes of the invisible Blessedness, and in servent Love to God and Man, and in an innocent Life, and Self-denying endeavours to do good to all, do so much convince and awe Mans Nature, and so powerfully command Approbation and Honour, that Satan and bad Men could not resist them; were it not that such excellent Persons are too Rare, and that the far greater number of good Men are la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentably imperfect, and tainted with many unlovely Faults: And were it not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And whoever noteth it, shall find, that most that ever Hated and Persecuted men of eminent Holiness, were such as never intimately knew them, but only at a deceitful distance,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65560:8"/>
and such as heard them odiously described by lying Tongues.</p>
                     <p>And it is not a small benefit of this kind of History, that the Weak and Lame Christians may see such excellent Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples for their imitation; and the sluggish and distempered Christian may have so real and lively a reproof; and the discouraged Christian may see that higher degrees of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, are indeed attainable; and that the dark and troubled Christian may see the Methods in which Gods Spirit doth work upon his Servants, and see that a Genuine Christian life, is a Life of the greatest joy on earth: And that the sloathful Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite, may see that Religion is a serious Business: And that the factious Christian, may see that a man may be eminently Holy, that is not of his Opinion, Side, or Party: And that both the proud domineering <hi>Pharisee</hi> may see, that eminent Piety is separated from his Traditions, Formalities, Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and Pomp: And the Opinionative Hypocrite may see, that Holiness consisteth of something else, than in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstantial and siding Singularities, and in a condemning of other mens outward Expressions, or Modes of Worship, or a boisterous Zeal against the Opinions and Ceremonies of others.</p>
                     <p>And it is a notable benefit of this kind of History, that it is fitted to Insinuate the Reverence and Love of Piety into <hi>young unexperienced Persons:</hi> For before they can read much of <hi>Theological</hi> Treatises with understanding or delight, Nature enclineth them to a pleasure in History, and so their Food is sugard to their Appetites, and <hi>Profit</hi> is entertained by <hi>delight.</hi> And nothing taketh well with the Soul, that is not pleasant to it; nor did he ever know the true way of Educating Youth, or doing good to any, that knew not the way of drawing them to a pleasedness, and love to goodness: <hi>Omne <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>On such Accounts, we may conclude that such men as <hi>Melchior Adamus,</hi> Mr. <hi>Samuel Clark,</hi> &amp;c. that have served the Church with this sort of History, have done no small or useless Service; which we the easilier perceive when we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member at what rates now the Church would purchase a full History of the Lives of all the Apostles, and all the Eminent Pastors of the Churches for the first two hundred, or three hundred Years; yea, or but of some few of them. And how
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65560:9"/>
much of the History of the Times they lived in, is contained in a just History of such mens Lives.</p>
                     <p>It were to be wished that more did as <hi>Thuanus,</hi> at large; or as <hi>Scultetm,</hi> in his <hi>Curriculum vitae suae</hi> at least; or yet as <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> and many others, that give us a Breviate of the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Passages of their own lives: Because no man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth usually those intimate Transactions of God upon mens Souls, which are the Life of such History, or at least no use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less part. But men are commonly supposed to be so selfishly partial, and apt to over-value all their own, and to fish for ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause; and it is so meet to avoid appearances of Pride, and Ostentation, that few think meet to take this course. And the next desirable is, That their intimate Friends would write their Lives at large, who are best able; as <hi>Camerarius</hi> hath done <hi>Melancthons;</hi> and <hi>Beza, Calvins;</hi> and as the Lives of <hi>Bucholtzer, Chytreaas,</hi> and many more are written.</p>
                     <p>But none of all this must be expected concerning this our Brother: Because he was young, and taken away before any had thoughts of gathering up his Words or Actions for any such use: Those that have done this little, being his Fathers, and Seniors, who looked to have died long before him: And because he lived in a time of Trouble, and Division, and Suspition, in which every man had great concernments of his own to mind; and in which men are afraid of praising the Holy Servants of God, lest it offend those that in some things differed from them.</p>
                     <p>The special Excellency of this Worthy Man, lay chiefly in the <hi>Harmony</hi> and <hi>Compleatness</hi> of such particular Gifts, and all of them in a high Degree, as use to exalt the fame of others, in whom some one or few of them is found. And all these in a man so young, as unless in one <hi>Job. Picus Mirandula,</hi> one <hi>Keckerman,</hi> one <hi>Pemble,</hi> in a Countrey, is rarely to be found. Do you desire the Preparatives of Languages, and Philosophy? In these he was Eximious, as his <hi>Treatise de Providentia,</hi> Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed for the Press (of which more anon) doth shew; with several other Manuscripts of like nature. How throughly had he searched the Writings of Philosophers? How fully had he found out how much Natural Reason doth attest, and speak for the Attributes and Providence of God, and the Principles of a Godly Life. And how much Super-natural Revelation
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65560:9"/>
presupposeth, and findeth ready to entertain it and befriend it in the Light and Law of Nature? How excellently able was he to deal with the Naturalist at his own Weapons, aud to shame them that call Religion an <hi>unproved</hi> or <hi>unreasonable thing?</hi> No doubt it was an excellent help to his own Faith, to have so clear and full a sight of all those <hi>Subsidiary natural Verities,</hi> which are known <hi>propriae luce,</hi> and are out of the reach of those malignant Suggestions, by which the Tempter is often questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning Supernatural Truths. Few Christians, and too few Divines do dig so deep, and proceed so wisely, as to take in all these natural helps; but overpassing those presupposed Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, do ost leave themselves open to the subtil affaults of the Tempter, who knoweth where the Breach is; and will some; times urge such Objections on them, as need a Solution <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Do you look for an high degree of <hi>Zeal?</hi> In this he was Marvellous, being a living Fire, continually burning in the love of God and Man; still mounting upward, and kindling all that were capable about him; As prone to <hi>Fervour</hi> and <hi>Activity,</hi> as earthen Natures to <hi>Cold</hi> and <hi>Idleness;</hi> not weary of well doing; not speaking slightly, and with indifferent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the great <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and of holy things; but with the reverence and seriousness, as became one that by Faith still saw the Lord: Not doing God's Work with an unwilling or a sluggish heart, as if he did it not, nor as those that fear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing losers by God, or of giving him more than he deserveth, or getting Salvation at too dear a rate: But as a Soul that was Kin to Angels, which are active Spirits, and a flame of Fire that came from God, the Lord of Life, and Father of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and liveth in God, and is working and passing up to God. As one that knew that none other work was worthy of a <hi>Man,</hi> (and approveable by any Reason, save that which is made a Salve to sense) except onely the Souls <hi>Resignation, Obedience,</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>seeking</hi> of the <hi>Heavenly durable Felicity,</hi> in the use of all those Means which God in Nature, and Scripture, hath appointed for the obtaining of it.</p>
                     <p>It is too common to find men that are long and deep Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents in <hi>Philosophy,</hi> and the <hi>Doctrinals,</hi> and Methods of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie,</hi> to be found none of the most Zealous or serious Divines;

and for the learnedst Doctors to be but of the coursest and weakest sort of Christians. Because they exercise the Head almost alone, and take little pains to work what Truths they know upon their Hearts: As if the <hi>head</hi> were more <hi>diseased</hi> with sin, than the Heart is, and the Heart had not as much need of a Cure: Or as if God's Grace did not as much dwell in the <hi>Will,</hi> as in the <hi>Understanding;</hi> and the Heart had not the noblest Work to do. <hi>Life, Light,</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> are the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable Influences and Effects of the Sanctifying Spirit: But yet sometimes the Indisposition of the Receiver, may keep out one of them more than the rest. <hi>Light</hi> alone may be profitable to the Church, by breeding <hi>Light</hi> in others: But <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> also are as suitable means to produce their like, as <hi>Light</hi> is. And without them, it is not a flashy Light and frigid Knowledge that will save the Soul.</p>
                     <p>And on the other side, alass, how ordinary is it for <hi>Zeal</hi> to make a bussle in the Dark, and for those that are very earnest to be very blind? And strong Affections (not to God himself, but about the exercise of Religious Duties) to be guided by a weak Understanding: And so for such well-meaning Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, to make most haste when they are out of the way, and to divide and trouble the Church and Neighbourhood, by their fervency in Errour, till late Experience hath ripened them to see what mischief their Self-conceitedness hath done? O! how happy were the Church of God, if great Understanding and fervent Zeal, were ordinarily as well conjoyned, as they were in this worthy Man.</p>
                     <p>And many have much <hi>Reading,</hi> and plentiful <hi>Materials</hi> for Learning, who yet were never truly Learned, as being <hi>Injudicious,</hi> and never having well digested what they Read, into the habits of solid Understanding. But so was it not with this our Brother, as his very Letters fully <hi>witness:</hi> How clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and solidly doth he resolve that great Question which he speaketh to? As one that had <hi>Theologie,</hi> not in his Books on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but in his Head and Heart.</p>
                     <p>And I account it no small part of his Excellency, that his Judgment led him to dwell so much on the great Essentials of Godliness and Christianity; the Love of God, and a holy, just, and sober Life: And that he laid not out his Zeal diseasedly, and unproportionably, upon those outward Circumstances,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65560:10"/>
where the noise doth call off the minds of too many, from the inward life of Communion with God: His Sermons, his Conference, his Letters, were not about Mint and Commin, but about the Knowledge of God in Christ, which is the Life Eternal.</p>
                     <p>Yet that he did not prostitute his Conscience to the Interest of the Flesh, nor subject God to the World, nor deny Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyal and the Cross of Christ; nor Hypocritically resolve to shift off the costly part of Religion, on pretence of <hi>Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency</hi> or <hi>Smallness</hi> of any thing, which he thought God forbad him; you need no other proof than the following History.</p>
                     <p>And he was not one of those weak well-meaning Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, who think that their meer <hi>Honesty</hi> is enough to deserve the esteem of worthy Pastors; nor was he one of those proud and empty Persons, who think that the Dignity of their Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is enough to oblige all to bow to them, and to be Ruled by them, without any personal <hi>Wisdom, Holiness,</hi> or <hi>Ministerial Abilities,</hi> suitable to their Sacred Office: But, so great was his Ministerial Skilfulness in the publick Explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Application of the Holy Scriptures, so Melting, and Winning, Convincing and Powerful, his unaffected sacred Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory; so wise and serious his private dealing with particular Families and Souls, that it is no wonder if God blessed him with that great success, which is yet visible among the People where he lived, and which many of his Brethren wanted. For he did not by slovenly Expressions, nor immethodical Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagances, nor unsound injudicious erroneous Passages, nor by jocular Levities, or by nauseous Tautologies, make Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, or Prayers, become a scorn; nor give advantage to carnal captious Hearers, who for every hair, not only abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the wholsomest Food, but also write Books to breed their own Disease in others: Nor yet did he by an affected unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural curiosity of Jingling Words, and starched Phrases, make Sermons like Stage-plays, and destroyed the Peoples Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, or their reverence of Holy Things: But he spake as one that spake from God, in the Name of Christ, for mens Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation and Salvation, in a manner suitable to the Weight and Holiness of the Matter.</p>
                     <p>And his servent Zeal and Thirst for the Peoples Conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Salvation, was a great advantage to his Success. For;

                     <p>And the moderation and peaceableness of this holy Man, was very exemplary and amiable; which I the rather mention, because in these distempered times of Temptation, too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny think that the excellency of Zeal lyeth in going to the furthest from those they differ from, and suffer by. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause some will think, that knew no more of him, but onely how oft and long he lay in the Common Goal, that sure, he was some violent unpeaceable Zealot. No, his Zeal was for Peace and Quietness, for Love and for good Works: He was not used to inflame men against Dissenters, nor to Back-bite others, nor to make those odious that were willing enough to have made him so: He fled from one extream with fear, and suspition of the other. He was indeed himself a Silenced Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, in a Place, and among a People who had his heart, and who had been blessed with his fruitful Labours; and his Judgment was, That it is Sacriledge for a Minister Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to God, to alienate himself, and violate that Covenant and Ministerial Dedication, by giving over his Work as long as he hath ability and opportunity, and the peoples Souls have a true necessity. And therefore he chose that long Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, rather than voluntarily to Surcease. But whilst he had Liberty, he went oft to the publick Assembles, and was a Hearer where he was wont to be a Teacher, and encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the People to do the like. He spake not evil of Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, nor kindled seditious Principles or Passions in the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples minds, nor disaffected them against Authority, nor ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated his own Sufferings to exasperate their minds against such as he suffered by; though how great they were as to the Effect, the Sequel will acquaint you. In all, he did in patience possess his Soul, and learned still more patience by the things which he suffered, and taught others what he learned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
                     <p>But above all, it is his highest excellency in my eyes, that
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65560:12"/>
he attained to the right temperament of the Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to a truly Evangelical frame of Spirit, suitable to the glorious hopes of Faith, and to the wonderful love of our Redeemer. And when most Christians think that they have done much, if they can but weep and groan over their Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and can abstain from the lustful Pollutions of the World, in the midst of many doubts and fears; LOVE and JOY, and a HEAVENLY MIND, were the Internal part of his Religion; and the large and fervent PRAISES of God, and THANKS GIVING for his Mercies, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cialiy for CHRIST, and the SPIRIT, and HEAVEN, were the External Exercises of it. He was not negligent in confessing Sin, nor Tainted with any <hi>Antinomian</hi> Errours; but PRAISE, and THANKSGIVING, were his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Strains; his <hi>frequentest, longest,</hi> and <hi>heartiest</hi> Services: He was no despiser of a broken Heart; but he had attained the blessing of a healed joyful Heart. The following Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, the strain of his Letters, but above all the admirations of his nearest Friends, will tell him that will enquire, how his tryumphant Discourses of the Hopes of Glory, and his frequent and fervent Thanksgiving and Praise, were the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage which he familiarly spake, and the very business of his Heart and Life. And, O how amiable is it to hear the Tongue employed seriously, and frequently, in that which it was made for; even in the praise of him that made it! And to see a man passing with joyful hopes towards Immortality! And to live as one that seriously believeth, that he must quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be in the Heavenly Church, and live with God and Christ for ever. O how comely is it to see a man that saith, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth that Christ hath redeemed him from Hell, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled him to God, and made him an Adopted Heir of Glory, to live like one that was so strangely saved from so great a misery, and with the most affectionate gratitude to honour the Purchaser of all this Grace: And how uncomely a thing is it to hear a man say, That he believeth all this Grace of Christ, this Heavenly Glory, this Love of God, and yet to be inclined to no part of Religion, but fears and complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and scarce to have any words of Praises or Thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, but a few, on the by, which are heartless affected, and constrained. O did Christians, yea Ministers, but Live with
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:65560:12"/>
the <hi>Joy</hi> and <hi>Gratitude,</hi> and <hi>Praise</hi> of Jehovah, which beseem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth those that believe what they believe, and those that are entring into the Coelestial Chore, they would then be an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to God and their Redeemer, and would win the World to a love of Faith and Holiness, and make them throw away their worldly Fool-games, and come and see what it is that these <hi>Joyous Souls</hi> have found: But when we shew the World no Religion, but Sighing, and Complaining, and live a sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der life than they, and yet talk of the glad-Tydings of Christ, and Pardon, and Salvation, we may talk so long enough, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they will believe us, that seem no more to be Believers our selves, or before they will leave their fleshly pleasures, for so sad and dreadful a Life as this.</p>
                     <p>And as this kind of Heavenly, Joyful Life is an honour to Christ, and a wonderful help to the Converting of the World, so is it a Reward to him that hath it; which made this Holy Person live in such a vigour of Duty, such fervour of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Love, and such continual Content in God, so that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God in him was <hi>Righteousness, Peace,</hi> and <hi>Joy in the Holy Ghost;</hi> which others think consisteth in <hi>Meats, Drinks,</hi> and <hi>Dayes,</hi> in Shadows and Circumstances, in Sidings and in singular Conceits, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 16. It was not a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy</hi> Spirit that acted him, nor did he tempt his People into such an uncomfortable state and strein. But in the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of his thoughts within him, the comforts of God did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light his Soul: His Meditation of God and his Redeemer was sweet, and he rejoyced in the Lord. He delighted in the Law of the Lord; and when delight invited him, no wonder if it were his Meditation day and night, <hi>Psal.</hi> 1. 2. &amp; 104. 34. &amp; 119. 103. &amp; 94. 19.</p>
                     <p>And how great a Solace was this in his Sufferings, when he could be in a Goal, and in Heaven at once? When he could, after the terrible torment of Convulsions, have the foresight and taste of Heavenly Pleasures? <hi>Nihil Crus sentit in Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vo, cum Animus est in Coelo,</hi> saith <hi>Tertul.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And as he lived, so he died, in <hi>Vigorous, Joyful Praises,</hi> and <hi>Thanksgivings:</hi> Reviving out of his long speechless Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsion, into those fervent Raptures, as if he had never been so impatient of being absent from the Lord, as when he was just passing into his Presence; or rather as if with <hi>Stephen,</hi> he
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65560:13"/>
had seen Heaven opened, and Christ in his Glory, and could not but speak of the unutterable things which he had seen. I deny not but his vigorous active Temper, might be a great help to all his holy Alacrity and Joy, in his healthful State: But when that frame of Nature was broken by such Torments, and was then dissolving, to hear a dying Man about sixteen hours together, like the ferventest Preacher in the Pulpit, pour out his Soul in Praises and Thanskgiving; and speak of God, of Christ, of Heaven, as one that could never speak enough of them; and that with a Vivacity and Force, as if he had been in former Health, and to tryumph in Joy as one that was just laying hold upon the Crown; surely in this there was something that was the Reward of all his former Praise and Thankfulness; and that which must needs tell the Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors the diference, not onely between the death of a Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Believer, and the wicked Unbeliever, but the weak and distempered Believer; also the difference between a sound and a diseased Christian, and between the tryumphant Faith and Hopes, of one that saw the God and World invisible, and the staggering Faith, and trembling Hopes of a feeble and distrustful Soul; and between the death of one that had been used to converse in Heaven, and to make Thanksgiving and Praise his Work, and of one that had been used to cleave to Earth, and make a great matter of the concernments of the Flesh, and to rise but little higher in Religion, then a course of outward Duty animated most with troublesome Fears: Though he died not in the Pulpit, yet he died in Pulpit-Work.</p>
                     <p>And I must also note, how great an advantage it was to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and to his Ministerial Works, that he was possessed deeply with this true sentiment, That the PLEASING of GOD is the proper ultimate end of Man, (not doubting but it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth the notion of glorifying him) for thus his heart was rightly principled, and all his Doctrine and Duties rightly animated.</p>
                     <p>And as in all his Ministry, he was extraordinarily addicted to open to the Hearers the Covenant of Grace, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain Religion in the true Notion of Covenanting with God, and Covenant-keeping, and greatly to urge men to deliberate well-grounded Resolutions in this Holy Covenant (as one
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:65560:13"/>
that understood that Baptizing is truly Christening, and that Baptism and the Lord's-Supper are our Sacramental Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting, and that we need no new Descriptions nor Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of Grace and Church-Titles, if we understand what these Sacraments truly mean:) So God was pleased to give him a certainty and sense of his Divine Faithfulness, in fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Promises of his Covenant, and a lively sense of all the benefits of it; and his Faith in God for the performance of his part, was as strong and fixed, as was his own Resolution, in the strength of Grace to be true to God: I compare not his resolution to God's Fidelity; for what comparison between God and Man, but onely to his belief of God's Fidelity, and his comfort in the assurance of the Conclusion. And as he was resolved through Grace never to forsake Christ, so Christ did never fail him, nor forsake him. And in his Ministry, in his Sufferings, and his Death, this Faith, this Hope, this Heavenly Joy, was his support and strength; and in the Valley of the shadow of Death, he feared no evil. But when his flesh and heart failed, as to natural strength, the Lord was the Rock or Strength of his Heart, and never failed him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 73. 25. <hi>Let me die the death of the Righteous, and let my last end be like his.</hi>

                     <p>I have premised this general Skeleton, as Limners and Builders first draw the Pillars and <hi>Stamina</hi> of their Work, which the following Narratives will fill up: And I have given you this general Index, or Contents, of what is distinctly contained in the Sequel. For the History is not drawn up by one Hand, nor as by one that intended rather to shew what he could say, than what the Person was, and did: But it is the brief Account of the several parts of his Life, drawn up by several of his most worthy and judicious Friends, that were present, or most intimate and familiar with him. And I take this to be the best Advantage to a History, as to the Truth, which should satisfie the Incredulous, though not as to Uniformity, and a fluid Stile, which might please the Curious. For a Man's Life is like a War or Battle: No dispersed War, no nor any one particular Battle, can fully be described by the Observations of any one man alone: But one Man is but in one place, and seeth onely that which is within his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, which his proper station did advantage him to see:
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65560:14"/>
But when Intelligent Men from each part of the Army do every one bring in their several <hi>Narratives,</hi> all set together, may be a satisfactory History of the whole War, or Fight: So when a Man's course of Life is transient, and one is his Familiar in his Youth, and another at riper Age, one in the University, and another in the Ministry; one in Prison, and another at Home; one in Health, and another at Death; it is no one of himself that can credibly report the whole. And therefore though by variety of Stile, it may seem a <hi>Ceuto,</hi> or incongruously composed; yet Truth being the Soul of Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; that's best which is best fitted to the lovers of Truth. And though one part be written by a Woman, (his Widow) and another by his Reverend Father in Law; another by that worthy Pastor whom he assisted; another by a Fellow Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and another by a Scholar of his intimate Acquaintance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet is there such Agreement in them all, and such Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of unquestionable Verity, especially to all that know these Worthy and Faithful Persons, that for my part I take it as coming to me with greater advantage, than if it had been an evener Thred, drawn out by one skilful Hand alone; as the writing of the History of Christ by the four Evangelists, is advantagious to the Christian Faith. The plainness and open Breast of a Godly Widow, and of so many Holy and most credible Friends, is another kind of Evidence, than the contrived History of a Learned Man, which is fitted to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of a Party, to which the persons Fame and Honour seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth requisite: I know not how a History of this Nature could come to the World with fairer humane Evidence of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable credibility than this doth.</p>
                     <p>And let Posterity know (for I need not tell it to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Age, who live in the Light) that though this Servant of Christ excelled very many of his Brethren, yet it is not that such men are wonders in this Age, that his Life is singled out to be recorded to Posterity: But because his affectionate Friends and Auditors, are forwarder than many others, hereby to tell the World, what Effects his Holy Doctrine, and Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, hath left upon their hearts: It makes the Writers heart to bleed, to think how many thousands of Souls do perish by <hi>Ignorance,</hi> and <hi>ungodliness,</hi> even in <hi>England,</hi> and how many vast Kingdoms of the World are deprived of the Gospel.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="27" facs="tcp:65560:14"/>If you ask, What Labours he hath left behind him? I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer; First, The great numbers of Holy Souls converted, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, and edified by his Doctrine, and the Example of his holy Life. The <hi>Specimen,</hi> or Exemplar of a right Minister of the Gospel, which he hath left to the Neighbour Ministers that knew him, and to those that now possess their Places, and to all the Ministers of the Land, and to the Ages that are yet to come: For who will not be convinced of the necessity and sweetness of Holy Diligence, in so good 2 Work, and become Laborious in the Word and Doctrine, who seriously readeth such Examples as this here set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him? And who that considereth it aright, can chuse but see, how greatly such Holy Labourers do differ from those that Preach the Gospel in strife and envie, to add affliction to <hi>Pauls</hi> Bonds, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 15. And those that use their Ministry but as Lawyers use the Laws, to get Preferment and worldly Wealth by it; that they may say, <hi>Soul, take thy Ease, Eat, Drink, and be Merry, thou hast Goods enough laid up for many years:</hi> Till they hear at last, <hi>Thou fool, this night shall they require thy Soul; Whose then shall the things be which thou possessest?</hi> So is every one that layeth up Riches for himself, and is not Rich towards God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> And for Writings, who can expect that a man that entered upon the Sacred Ministry at Twenty One years of Age; and died about Thirty Five, and lived in such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Ministerial Labours, should leave many Books be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him of his Writing, (in an Age wherein we have had too many Books, and too few such Ministers) yet the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing History tells us, He is the Author of tha <hi>Synopsis</hi> of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> in Mr. <hi>Richard Alleins</hi> Book.

                        <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> A Brief Relation of his early setting forth in the Christian Race, from his Childhood: Also some Memorials of his Industrious and Prosperous pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit of Learning, and of his singular Piety during his Abode in the <hi>University.</hi> Written by an Eye-Witness thereof.</head>
                     <p>MR. <hi>Joseph Allein,</hi> Born in the <hi>Devizes</hi> in <hi>Wiltshire,</hi> in the Year 1633. During his Child-hood, shewed forth a singular sweetness of Disposition, and a remarkable Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in every thing he was then imployed about. The first observable Zeal of Religion that appeared in him, was in the eleventh year of his Age, about which time he was noted to be very diligent in private Prayer, and so fixed in that Duty, that he would not be disturbed, or moved by the coming of any Person accidentally into the places of his Retirement. This and other Fruits of a Serious and Gracious Spirit, were the common observation of the Family. From this time forward, the whole course of his Youth, was an even-spun thred of Godly Conversation, which was rendered more amiable, by his sweet and pleasant deportment towards all he conversed with. While he thus openly began to run his Christian Race, his Brother Mr. <hi>Edward Allein,</hi> a worthy Minister of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel departed this Life: Whereupon he earnestly desired to be brought up in Preparation, to succeed him in the Work of the Ministry. Which good Motion, his Father gladly hearkned unto, and speedily prepared to putit in Execution. Such was his great diligence at School, that he redeemed for his Book, the time allotted for Recreation. In the space of about four years, he attained to very good knowledge in the <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Tongues, and was by his School-Master, adjudged fit for University-Studies. After which, he abode some time with his Father in the Country, where a worthy Minister
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65560:16"/>
of the Place read <hi>Logick</hi> to him: And when he was about sixteen years Old, he was placed in <hi>Lincoln</hi> Colledge in <hi>Oxford.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He had not been long in the University, but a <hi>Wiltshire</hi> Place becoming void in <hi>Corpus Christi</hi> Colledge, he was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen SCHOLAR of that House: The Pregnancy of his Parts, assuring all that his own MERITS were the SOLE FRIENDS, the ONLY MANDAMUS which brought him in.</p>
                     <p>Being entered and setled, he gave both early and constant Proofs, of his indefatigable Industry; Signalizing thereby his love to Learning, and evidently Demonstrating how much he abhorr'd to be found a Drone in such a Hive. He esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Colledge an otherguess place than a VICTUALING HOUSE, and coming into this with a Nobler design, than onely to TAKE COMMONS: He thought himself happy in nothing so much, as the advantage he had gain'd for the best <hi>Aquists.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I have known too many, who in the very Places which they have got by their Parts, have lost the Parts which got them their Places; and peradventure had been excellent excellent Scholars, had they never had those Incouragements to be so, which they unhappily won from their Competitors. For Idleness enervates the strength of Nature, and makes those <hi>Loggs</hi> that might have been <hi>Mercuries;</hi> but this Person was none of those. He quitting himself so well at the Election, was but a Pledge and Earnest of his doing better afterwards. He made it appear to all observing him, that when he stood, he stood not so much for a Place, as for the Accomplishments by his future studiousness attainable in it, demeaning himself like one, who even in the dayes of his Vanity, well understood how prophane a thing it was to live in a School of Learning, no otherwise than as if it were a Sanctuary for Lasiness, or a Place priviledg'd with nothing else but Leave and Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to eat the Founders Bread, with no other sweat of the Brow, than what's provok'd in a Ball Court.</p>
                     <p>Never had Learning a truer Drudge since she kept House in <hi>Oxford.</hi> At her Work, he was both day and night, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all time too little, no pains too much that he spent in her Service: When but a School-Boy (as I have heard) he was
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:65560:16"/>
observed to be so studious, that he was known as much by this Periphrasis [<hi>The Lad that will not play</hi>] as by his name: And sure I am, when in the University, he was so generously and ingeniously bookish, that he deserved to be called, The Scholar, who by his good will would do nothing else but Pray and Study.</p>
                     <p>Courteous he was, and very civil to all Acquaintance: But if they came to visit him at Studying times, though they were sure enough to find him within, yet withal so busie general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with better Company, as to have no leisure to let them in. And if at this they were moved, and murmured, and went away offended with him, he cared not. That notable Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of <hi>Joachimus Fortius,</hi> which shut him up, bearing him out, and being his relief in all such Cases, <hi>Viz. Better it is that they should wonder at thy rudeness, than thou shouldest lose thy time; for only one or two will take notice of that, but all Posterity would be sensible of this.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>His Appetite to his Business being that to him, which Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larms in their Chambers are wont to be to others; seldom it was that he could be found in Bed after four in the Morning, though he had stayed up on the same occasion on which he then rose, till almost One over-night.</p>
                     <p>For though whilst Junior Scholar, he obtained many weekly SLEEPING DAYS for others, yet in many years he could hardly vouchsafe himself so much as one.</p>
                     <p>And as thus he begrudg'd himself his Rest, so thus also his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Food: It being as familiar with him to give away his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons (at least) once, as with any others to eat theirs twice a day. As if he who was never satisfied how many Volumns soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he devoured, had looked upon it as a kind of gluttony, to eat that Meal, the time of eating which might without preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to Health, have been better spent upon a Book. <hi>Porphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> Wish, <hi>viz.</hi> That he were able to live without eating, and drinking at all, that so he might be wholly taken up about nobler things, Is sure the with of thousands in the Leardned World. Certain I am it was his, and that if Piety would have suffered him, and they had not been such dears Friends, he would have fallen out with God, for tying his Soul to such a Body, as could not subsist without (what he would often call no better than time-consuming things) Meat, and Drink, &amp; Sleep.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="32" facs="tcp:65560:17"/>That this his laborious Studiousness, was as delightful and pleasant to him, as the highest Voluptuousness can be to the most sensual Sot; I conclude not onely from the constancy of it, but from his charging Matrimony, to which afterwards he became a Subject, with no greater tyranny, than the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity which it laid upon him, of being kinder sometimes unto himself, than he was wont to be in <hi>Oxford.</hi> For being Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, an intimate Friend of his of the same Colledge, who had thoughts of changing his Condition, wrote to him, and (in a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> manner) desired of him an Account of the Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences of Marriage; to whom he returned this pleasant (but very significant) Answer. Thou wouldest know the Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences of a Wife, and I will tell thee; First of all, whereas thou risest constantly at four in the Morning, or before, she will keep thee till about six. Secondly, Whereas thou usest to study fourteen Hours in the day, she will bring thee to eight or nine. Thirdly, Whereas thou art wont to forbear one Meal a day at least for thy Studies, she will bring thee to thy Meat: If these be not Mischiefs enough to afright thee, I know not what thou art.</p>
                     <p>Through his Industry (with God's Blessing on it) he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly prospered in his Studies, and quickly appeared a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Proficient. He would often say, he chiefly affected rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Learning, valuing Skill in Languages, onely for the sake of things, and those things most, which were of all most like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to improve his Judgment. And the truth of his words was sufficiently evident: For all that knew him, knew him to be as good a Linguist, so as smart a Disputant, and an excellent Philosopher. When he performed any <hi>Academical</hi> Exercises, either in the Hall, or in the Schools; he seldom or never came off without the Applause, or (at least) Approbation of all, but the envious; who also themselves, even by their very Detractions, in spight of their Teeth, commended him; there being to the Ingenuous, no surer sign almost of his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving acquitted himself well, than that such, as they could not endure it should be said so.</p>
                     <p>Certain I am, his pregnant Parts, and early Accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, were so much taken notice of in the Colledge, that so soon almost as he was but Batchellor of Arts, he was even com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to Commence a Tutor; and presently intrusted (to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:65560:17"/>
speak within compass) with as great a number of Pupils as any in the House. Some of his Scholars are now Graduates in Divinity, and singular Ornaments of that flourishing Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, (as Mr. <hi>John Rosewel,</hi> B. D. Mr. <hi>Nicholas Horseman,</hi> B. D. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) others of them, who left the University, have not gone without considerable preferments in the Church, (as Mr. <hi>John Peachil,</hi> lately Lecturer at St. <hi>Clements Danes,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Temple-Bar;</hi> Mr. <hi>Christopher Coward,</hi> Prebendary of <hi>Wells,</hi> &amp;c.) And I make no question but all of them (which are yet alive) honour his memory, and will at any time be ready to express the grateful sense which they retain of the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage they received from his prudent instructions and pious Examples.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true indeed, he had no advancement proportionable to his Merits whilst he staid amongst us: But if there were any thing to be blam'd for that, 'twas nothing else but his own Self-denyal. For a Chaplains place becoming void, he chose that before a Fellowship, which he knew well enough, in a little time, would of course, and by right, have been certainly his. And this choice having been made by him at first deliberately, he never after in the least repented, but rather often reflected on with a great deal of content and comfort. For he had alwayes such an huge affection for Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that he and his Friend could hardly ever walk and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course together, but before they parted (at his desire) they must also go and Pray together. And what a pleasure then may we think it was to him, twice a day to engage a whole Society, in so dear an Exercise, with a <hi>Let us pray!</hi> Frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indeed have I heard him say, <hi>He prized the Imployment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove that,</hi> which generally we reckoned much better Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and look'd upon it as his honour and happiness.</p>
                     <p>And 'twas well with us that so he did, it being hardly possible that the duty of the place should have been by any discharged better than it was by him. We were not used to a great deal of Noise, vain Tautologies, crude Effusions, untelligible Sense, or mysterious Non-sence, instead of Prayer. His Spirit was serious, his Gesture reverent, his Words few, but premeditated and well weighed, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, and to the full expressive of his as truly humble as ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest desire. He loathed the sawciness, which went by the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:65560:18"/>
name of <hi>Holy Boldness,</hi> and drew near to God; not as if he had been going to play with his Mate, but as became a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture overaw'd with the Majesty of his great Creator. He prayed with the Spirit, and the Understanding also; confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Sin with real Grief, inward Hatred, and Detestation; and beg'd the Mercies he came to beg, like one that felt the want and worth of what he beg'd, with Faith and Fervency, and true Importunity; his Affections working, but working rationally as well as strongly.</p>
                     <p>And this (as I doubt not it prevailed above) so it had on us the more powerful influence, because we found it to be no meer Religious Fit, but exactly agreeable to the habitual frame and disposition of the Man. 'Tis a shrewd reflection which <hi>Suidas</hi> makes on the Philosopher <hi>Sallust,</hi> (how truly I know not, he is neither civil nor just to some) <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. <hi>Sallust's</hi> carriage was strange to all men; For though when he read his Philosophy Lectures, he did it gravely and very solemnly; yet at other times he plaid the Child, and that most ridiculously. And there are too many, both Chaplains and Preachers, who justly merit as bad a Censure: Whilst Praying and Preaching, they appear demure, and mighty devout; yet take them out of their Desks, and Pulpits, and they are as light, as vain, and frothy; yea, extreamly disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute as any others. But it was not so with this Person: For he was alwayes composed and serious, grave and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend, above his Age. He set God alwayes before him, and where-ever he was, laboured to live as in his Presence. It was his solemn business to be Religious, his great endeavour to walk by Rule; his main design in all his wayes, to approve himself unto his Father, which saw in secret, and his daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise to keep a Conscience void of offence, both towards God and towards man.</p>
                     <p>As for the pleasures and delights of Sin, he highly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:65560:18"/>
entertain himself with them, yet how little was his heart un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, or was he (generally) taken with them! He was as formal in using them, as some Christians are in God's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; as they sometimes do pray, as if indeed they prayed not; and hear, as if they heard not; so he rejoyced in such things as these, as if indeed he rejoyced not. He looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, compared with others, as upon his Righteousness, compared with Christ's, as very vanity, yea, dross and dung. His conversation being in Heaven, his sweetest Comforts, and most prised Refreshments, were Divine and Heavenly. His Soul took often a delightful prospect of Eternity, viewing the Regions of Bliss and Glory, looking wishly at (her Fathers Seat) the Mount of Joy, aspiriring after a nobler Mansion, and hugging her self in a comfortable perswasion, that it would not be long ere she should be in it. And hereupon as he little minded any Earthly glory, so he little minded or cared for the poor and empty delights of sense.</p>
                     <p>However, he was not morosly pious, nor did his Affection to God and Goodness, and the things Above, make him either a <hi>Timon</hi> or a <hi>Cynic;</hi> (It had not then been so true and genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, and of so right a kind as it was) <hi>Homilitical</hi> Virtue he as much excelled in as any other, and the decried <hi>Morality</hi> found ever with him very great respect, being recogniz'd as an integral part of his Religion.</p>
                     <p>He was of as sweet a disposition, and of as highly civil a conversation, as a man (subject to the common frailties of humane nature) almost could be. He had scarce a gesture which did not seem to speak, and by a powerful and charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Rhetcrick,</hi> affect all whom he conversed with. Were it not that so many other moral Perfections and Excellencies besides that, it might as truly be said him, as, by the Historian, was of the Emperour, in respect of his clemency, That he was <hi>Totus ex comitate,</hi> made up as it were of nothing else but Courtesie and Affability.</p>
                     <p>For a Friend, I think I may safely say, He was one of the truest that ever Person had interest in; and withal, as plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant as a serious Christian could well wish. He loved not rashly, but where he loved, he loved intirely; and who ever came to be entertained in his Affections, were sure to find a warm Lodging: There was no more but only one thing,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:65560:19"/>
which he thought too much for any, for whom he thought not his Love too good. He could not sin (knowingly, and willingly) for any Friend he had on Earth. When <hi>Lelius</hi> in the presence of the <hi>Romane</hi> Consuls, (who after thecondemnation of <hi>Tiberius <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap>:</hi> He answered, <hi>All things:</hi> What all things, repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Lelius?</hi> Suppose he had willed you to burn our Temples, would you have done it at his request? I know, said <hi>Blosius,</hi> he could never command it; but if he had, I had obeyed him. I confess this Friend did never dare to be such a Friend, or any thing like him: But <hi>Usque ad Aras,</hi> so far as lawfully and conscientiously he might do any thing, he stuck at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wherein he might serve, pleasure, or gratifie them he lov'd.</p>
                     <p>And yet his love was not ingrossed by his Friends onely; for whilst to them he shewed himself friendly, good nature as well as Christianity, obliged him to be kind to all, and (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his ability) to the Poor bountiful. He was too frugal to throw away his Charity, yet not so covetous as to with-hold it when he met with Objects to whom 'twas due. He did not think the little he had so much his own, as that his necessitous Brethren might not claim a part in it; and therefore gave them as if he had been paying Debts, and not bestowing Alms. But of all most admirable was his affection to the Souls of others, and his desire to do good to them. This indeed was most conspicuous, and seemed to shew,</p>

Some there are, to my knowledge, who at this day do verily think, they should never have found the way to live, to live for ever, if he had liv'd unto himself.

Frequent visits also was he us'd to make at other times, to other persons in the World that were but mean and low; his main design (together with the relieving of their temporal wants) being to assist their Souls, and help them forward in their way to Heaven. And indeed, in all his Converses, where-ever he was, he was like Fire, (as <hi>

It was hardly pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to be in his company, and not to hear such things from him, as, if well weighed, might have been enough to make one out of conceit with Sin, and in love with Vertue, as long as one lived. Though he did not say (as <hi>Titus</hi> once) yet by his actions, we may judge he thought that he had even quite lost a day, when none had gained somewhat by him. He lived as if he had been quickned with that saying, (which I have somewhere met with in <hi>Tertullian</hi>) <hi>Quid prodest esse, quod esse non prodest?</hi> To what purpose is it to live, and not to live to some good purpose.</p>
                     <p>But this was that (this ardent love to the Souls of men) that quickly depriv'd us of his company, it carried him down into the Countrey, where, how he demeaned and carried him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, let others speak.</p>

                     <p>OF his Extract, I shall say little; He was the Son of a godly Father, Mr. <hi>Tobie Allein,</hi> sometime of the <hi>Devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes,</hi> an understanding, affectionate, prudent, and signally humble, and experienced Christian; who died suddenly, but sweetly; his Son surviving him not above a year or two. He having been languishing for some time, at length he seemed to be upon eecovery, and went about his House; on the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before he died, he arose about four; about 10 or 11 he came down out of his Closet, and called for something to eat, which being prepared, he gave Thanks, but could not eat any thing: His Wife perceiving a sudden change in him, perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him to go to his Bed; He answered, No, but I will die in my Chair, and I am not afraid to die; He sat down and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly said, My Life is hid with Christ in God, and then he closed his Eyes with his own hands, and died immediately. No more of the Father: Concerning his Son I shall speak,</p>
                     <p>What he was, and what his temper and behaviour was.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. <hi>As a Man.</hi> He was, 1. Of quick natural parts, and great acquired Abilities, concerning which I shall need say no more, there being a fuller Account given by another Hand.</p>

                        <pb n="39" facs="tcp:65560:20"/>2. Of a composed grave and serious temper and behaviour, not at all morose, but full of candour, free, affable, chearful, and courteous.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>As a Christian.</hi> He was for exemplary Holiness and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venliness of mind and life, much elevated above the ordinary Rank. He lived much in delightful Communion with God, his Soul was greatly exercised in Divine Contemplation, and he would sometimes speak (to provoke others, whom he wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the same delights, to the same exercise) what ineffable pleasure, sweetness, and satisfaction his Soul had found in his stated Meditations on the Divine Attributes, distinctly one by one. In his Discourses he would speak much and passionately to the commending and exalting of the Divine Goodness, and of the inexpressible dearness and tenderness of the Divine Love. In Prayer he was not ordinarily so much in confession or complaining of Corruption and Infirmities, (though he expressed a due sense of these) as in the admiring and praising of God in his Infinite Glorious Perfections, in the mention of his wonderful Works, particularly of those Wonders of his Love revealed in Jesus Christ. In some of his Letters to me, when he had been speaking of the Grace and Goodness of God to him, (of the sense whereof he would seem to be even quite swallowed up) he would break off with some such Expressions as these, <hi>I am full of the Mercies of the Lord; O Love the Lord for me; O praise the Lord for my sake; O help me, help me to praise the Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>His whole Life was adorned and beautified with the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable lustre of his particular personal Graces.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>He was a Man of Love.</hi> His sweet amicable and courteous converse, was such as made him the <hi>deliciae</hi> of his Acquaintance, and made way for the entertainment both of his serious Counsels and severer Reproofs: He grew dear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Saints that knew him, because they saw in his very face and all his Carriages, how very dear they were to him. His compassion to those in distress, his bounty to those in want, (wherein he abounded beyond his ability) his forbearance in case of offences, his affectionate Language and Carriage, his readiness to all obliging Offices of Love to his Relations, to his Friends, to Strangers, to Enemies, did evidently declare how he loved them. Especially his Love was let forth in
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:65560:21"/>
fuller streams upon the Congregation where he exercised his Ministry. The People of his Care, were the People of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. His ardent longing for their Souls, his rejoycing in their Souls — prosperity, his bleedings and breakings of Soul under any of their falls or infirmities, his uncessant la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours among them, both publickly, and from House to House, his frequent and affectionate Letters to them when he was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent; his earnest desire to live and die, and be buried amongst them, (declaring to them, <hi>That if he died within fifty miles of</hi> Taunton, <hi>his will was to be brought and buried there, that his Bones might be laid with their Bones, his Dust mingled with their Dust</hi>) these all declare how greatly they were in his Heart.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>He was a Man of Courage.</hi> 1. He feared no dangers in the way of his Duty, knowing that <hi>He that walks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly, walks surely.</hi> In cases less clear, he was very inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to understand his way, and then he fixed without fear.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. He feared not the faces of Men, but where occasion was, he was bold in admonishing, and faithful in reproving; which ungrateful Duty he yet managed with such prudence, and such expressions of Love, and compassion to Souls, as made his way into hearts more easie, and his work more suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesful.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>He was a Son of Peace;</hi> Both a zealous Peace-maker among differing Brethren, in case of personal Quarrels and Contentions; and he was also of sober and peaceful Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and an healing Spirit, as to Parties or Factions upon the account of Religion. He had an awful and reverend regard to Magistrates, abhorring all provoking and insolent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, or mutinous and tumultous Actions against them.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>He was a Man of Truth and Righteousness;</hi> Both as to his own personal practice, and also was much in pressing it upon others, especially professors of Religion, to be exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plarily just in their dealings, and true in their words; to be wary in promising, and punctual in performing. O how often and passionately have I heard him bewailing the Sins of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise-breaking and deceitful dealing, whereof such as he hath known to be guilty, have understood both by Word and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting how much his Soul was grieved at them, for the wrong they did hereby to their own Souls especially, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:65560:21"/>
they brought upon the Gospel of our Lord.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>He was of great Patience.</hi> To say nothing of his behaviour under sufferings of other kinds, his great weakness, and long languishing for some years together, and his constant serenity, calms and quietness of Spirit, in all that time, so far from the least touch of murmuring, that he was still blessing the Lord for his tender dealings with him, have given the World a full proof that he was of a patient Spirit.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>He was Eminent in Liberality;</hi> He not only did, but <hi>devised liberal things, and by liberal things did he stand;</hi> He studied and considered how he might both give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and procure from others, relief for those in want: He gave much Alms daily, both in the place where he lived, and where-ever he came. When there were Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at any time for pious and charitable uses, He stirred up others to bountiful giving, both by Word, and also by his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. In the Collection for the Fire in <hi>London,</hi> He gave publickly such a liberal proportion as he thought meet to be an example to others; and (as I came occasionally to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand) lest it should be misjudged, he had been known to give more, he gave more than as much again secretly. He distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted much amongst his Relations. His Aged Father, and divers of his Brethren, with their large Families, being fallen into decay, he took great care for them all, and gave educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to some, Pensions to other, Portions to others of them; and notwithstanding all this, he had but a very small matter of Stock to begin upon, and never above 80 pounds <hi>per ann.</hi> that I know of, and near the one half of his time, not above half so much; only by the industry of his Wife, who for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers years kept a Boarding-School, his income was for that time considerably enlarged. He took great pains in journey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings abroad to many Gentlemen, and othe rich Men in the Countrey, to procure a standing supply for such <hi>Non-conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ministers</hi> as were in want.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>He was of an Active Spirit.</hi> He went about doing good. As he was abundant and uncessant in his Labours in the Congregation where he lived; So where-ever he came, he would be scattering some good Seed, not only among the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dult, but he would be dealing much with the Children in those Families into which he came, asking them Questions,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:65560:22"/>
giving them Counsel, and sometimes leaving them his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel in Writing. In his own Family (which was great whilst his Wife kept Boarders) he was exceedingly industrious; the gravity of his Carriage, contempered with much sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and affability towards those young ones, begat in many of them, the Awe and Love, as of Children to their Father, and made way for the success of his Indeavours with them, which was considerable upon divers of them. At <hi>Bath,</hi> while he lay sick there, he sent for many of the Poor, both Old and Children, and gave them Catechisms, engaging them to learn them, and give him an account; who came chearfully and frequently to him, being encouraged hereto by his Familiar and Winning Carriage; his giving them Money, his Feeding and Feasting them. He would sometimes say, <hi>It's pity that Counsel of our Lord</hi> (Luk. 14. 13.) <hi>of Feasting the Poor, was no more practised amongst Christians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">8. <hi>He was of an humble Spirit.</hi> Though God had so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly listed him up in the Hearts of others, yet he was not puffed up in his own: He was low in his own eyes, and despised the praise of men. His whole carriage was without the least ostentation, and he was of great condescention to the Weakest or Meanest. Once or twice he was complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to me of the pride of his Heart; I (judging it to proceed rather from an holy jealousie of himself, and a tenderness of the least spark of that evil, than from any power it had upon him) replyed to him (as I remember) to this purpose: If he had a proud Heart, he had it to himself, for none else could perceive it. But he answered, <hi>Some men that are proud enough, have more wit than to let every one know it.</hi> Another time making the same complaint in a Letter to me, he added this: <hi>But my naughty heart, whilst I am writing this, is in hope you will not believe me.</hi> So watchful was he, as to espie and check the least motions of that Lust, which he so much ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>As a Minister.</hi> He was setled in <hi>Taunton Magdalen,</hi> as an Assistant to the Reverend Pastour there; with whom, as a Son with the Father, he served in the Gospel. I shall say nothing here, there being a large Account given under the Hand of that worthy Person.</p>
                     <p>But besides his Labours in that great Congregation, in
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:65560:22"/>
which alone he was fixed, the care for many other Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions was daily upon him. He went forth frequently into se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places about the Countrey, amongst the poor ignorant people that lived in dark Corners, and had none to take care of them, and both Preached to them himself, and stirred up many of his Brethren; whose forward minds readily joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him, to set up standing Lectures amongst them. He had an Eye to poor <hi>Wales,</hi> and had an influence upon the sending over some Ministers to them: He resolved also to have gone and spent some time amongst them himself, and by all the disswasions of his Friends, from his great Weakness and Unfitness for Travail, he was hardly with-held from his Purpose.</p>

                     <head>
                        <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> An Account of his Godly Life and Practice, and of the Course of his Ministry in <hi>Taunton,</hi> given by Mr. <hi>George Newton,</hi> the Reverend Pastor there, whose Assistant he was.</head>
                     <p>MR. <hi>Joseph Allein</hi> came to my Assistance, in the Year 1655. being then in the One and Twentieth year of his Age; and we continued together with much mutual Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.</p>
                     <p>I soon observed him to be a young Man of Singular Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishments, Natural and Acquired. His Intellectuals so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, his Memory strong, his Affections lively, his Learning much beyond the ordinary Size: And above all, his Holiness eminent, his Conversation exemplary; In brief, he had a good Head, and a better Heart.</p>
                     <p>He spent a considerable part of his time in private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verses with God, and his own Soul; he delighted very much to perform his secret Devotions in the view of Heaven, and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:65560:23"/>
the open Air, when he could find advantages fit for his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. He used to keep many dayes alone, and then a private Room would not content him, but (if he could) he would withdraw himself to a solitary House, that had no inhabitant in it: And herein he was gratified often by some private Friends of his, to whom he did not impart his design: Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it was, that he might freely use his Voice as his Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons led him, without such prudential considerations and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straints as would have been necessary in another place; and that he might converse with God without any avocation or distraction.</p>
                     <p>His conversation with others, was alwayes mingled with Heavenly and Holy Discourses; he was ready to Instruct, and to Exhort, and to Reprove, which he never failed to do (when he thought it necessary) what-ever the event might be: But he performed it usually with such respect, humility, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness, self-condemnation, and compassion, that a reproof from him did seldom, if at all, miscarry.</p>
                     <p>In the Houses where he Sojourned, their Hands fed one, but his Lips fed many; God freely poured Grace into his Lips, and he freely poured it out. None could live quietly in any visible and open sin, under his inspection: When he came to any House to take up his abode there, he brought Salvation with him; when he departed, he left Salvation behind him. His manner was, when he was ready to depart, and to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant himself into some other Family, (as that the exigence of his condition and the time, did more than once constrain him to) to call the People one by one into his Chamber; from whence it was observed, that scarce any one returned with dry eyes.</p>
                     <p>In matters of Religion, and the first Table, his strictness was so exemplary, (which was near to rigour) that I have scarce known any of his years keep pace with him. Surely he did more than others; His Righteousness exceeded not the <hi>Publican</hi> only, but the <hi>Pharisees</hi> too. He was much taken with Monsieur <hi>de Reuty,</hi> (whose Life he read often) and imitated some of his Severities upon better grounds: How often have I heard him to admire (among many other things) especially his self-annihilation, striving continually to be Nothing, that, God might be all.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="45" facs="tcp:65560:23"/>But here he stayeth not, he was a second-Table-man, a man of Morals; I never knew him spotted in the least degree with any unjust or uncharitable Act. And I am sure, the many failings of Professors in this kind, touched him to the very quick, and brought him low; drew Prayers, Tears, Complaints, and Lamentations, both by Word and Letter from him, though yet the Lord would not permit him to behold and reap the Fruit before he died.</p>
                     <p>He had an eminently, free, and bountiful heart to his power; and I may truly say, beyond his power; yea, much beyond it, he was willing of himself. It is but seldom that the best do need restraint in these Matters; and yet we read of some who brought more than enough, yea, much more than enough, <hi>Exod.</hi> 36. 5. So that there was a Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on issued out, to put a stop upon their Bounty, and it is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded presently, so the People were restrained. Men universal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly almost do need a Spur, but he did rather need a Bridle. When other men gave little out of much, he gave much out of little; and while they heapt and gathered up, he disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and scattered abroad. He did not hide himself from his own flesh, but was helpful to Relations, as some of them have great reason to acknowledge. His charity began at home, but it did not end there; for <hi>he did good to all,</hi> (according to his opportunities) though <hi>especially to the Houshold of Faith.</hi> He considered the Poor, he studied their condition; he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised liberal things; he was full of holy Projects, for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of the good of others, both Spiritual and Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; which he pursued with such irresistable vigor, and zeal, and activity, that they seldom proved abortive.</p>
                     <p>He was a man of extraordinary condescention to the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of weaker Brethren, as they that are most holy, and best acquainted with themselves, are wont to be: <hi>Instructing those that were contrary minded in meekness; If God perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture would give them repentance to the acknowledging of the Truth: Restoring those who were overtaken with a fault, with the Spirit of Meekness.</hi> So dealing with them in such a loving, sweet, and humble way, as considering himself, lest he also might be tempted. In their confessed failings, he was no way supercilious, captious, and censorious; he would maintain a good opinion of another, upon a narrower
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:65560:24"/>
footing than many others, who (to say no more) were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing stricter, holier, humbler, than himself would be. His Charity, <hi>Believed all things</hi> that were to be believed, and <hi>Hoped all things</hi> that were to be hoped. And when he deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemned the Action, he would not judge of the Estate: Indeed he had more charity for others than himself; and though he were sufficiently mild in his judgment of others, he was se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere enough in his judgment of himself.</p>
                     <p>He was not Peremptory in matters that belong to doubtful Disputations: He laid no more weight and stress on Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Opinions in Religion, that wholly depend upon <hi>Topical</hi> Arguments, than belongs to them. He was not like many who are so over-confident in their determinations, that they will hardly hold communion; Nay, scarce so much as a pleasing conversation with any man (how gracious soever) who cannot think, and say, and act in every thing as they do. He would allow his Fellow-Members the Latitude that the Apostle doth; and so would freely and familiarly converse with those who are sound in the Faith, (as to the fundamentals of Religion) and who were strict and holy in their lives, of all Perswasions.</p>
                     <p>His Ministerial Studies were more than usually easie to him, being of a quick conceit, a ready, strong, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful memory, a free expression (which was rather nervous and substantial, than soft and delicate) and which was best of all, a holy Heart that boyled and bubled up with good matter. This <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> him on all occasions, not with warm affections onely, but with holy Notions too. For his Heart was an Epistle, written not with Ink, but with the Spirit of the Living God: And out of this Epistle, he drew many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent things. In the course of his Ministry, he was a good Man, and in his Heart a good Treasure; whence he was wont continually to bring forth good things, both in publick and private.</p>
                     <p>He was apt to Preach and Pray, most ready on all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions to lay out himself in such Work, yea, spending him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in such Work: When my suddain Distemper seised up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, put him at any time (as many times they did) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on very short and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> preparations, he never refused; no, nor so much as fluctuated in the undertaking: But being
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:65560:24"/>
called, he confidently cast himself upon the Lord, and trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed perfectly to his Assistance, who had never failed him; and so he readily and freely went about his Work without distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                     <p>He began upon a very considerable stock of Learning, and Gifts Ministerial and Personal, much beyond the proportion of his Years, and grew exceedingly in his Abilities and Graces, in a little time. So that his profiting appeared to all Men; he waxed very rich in heavenly Treasure, by the blessing of God on a diligent hand, so that he was behind in no good Gift. He found that pretious promise sensibly made good, <hi>To him that hath</hi> (for use and good employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) <hi>shall be given, and he shall have abundance.</hi> He had no Talent for the Napkin, but all for Traffique, which he laid out so freely for his Masters use, that in a little time they multiplyed so fast, that the Napkin could not hold them. I heard a worthy Minister say of him once, (not withont much admiration) <hi>Whence hath this man these things?</hi> He under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood whence he had them well enough, and so did I, even from Above, whence every good and perfect Gift proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: God blessed him in all Spiritual Blessings in Heavenly Things, and he returned all to Heaven again; he served God with all his might, and all his strength; he was abundant in the Work of the Lord; he did not go, but run the wayes of his Commandments: He made haste and lingred not; <hi>He did run, and was not weary; he did walk, and was not saint.</hi> He pressed hard towards the Mark, till he attained it; his Race was short and swift, and his End glorious.</p>
                     <p>He was infinitely and insatiably greedy of the Conversion of Souls, wherein he had no small success in the time of his Ministry: And to this end, he poured out his very Heart in Prayer and in Preaching; <hi>He imparted not the Gospel only, but his own Soul.</hi> His Supplications, and his Exhortations, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times were so affectionate, so full of holy Zeal, Life, and Vigor, that they quite overcame his Hearers: He melted over them, so that he thawed and molified, and sometimes dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the hardest Hearts. But while he melted thus, he wasted, and at last consumed himself.</p>
                     <p>He was not satisfied to spend himself in publique, but used constantly to go from House to House, and there to deal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:65560:25"/>
(where he had a free reception) both with the Governours, and with the Children, and with the Servants of the Houshold, instructing them especially in the great Fundamental necessary Truths of the Law, and of the Gospel, where he observed them to be ignorant: Gently reproving them, where he found any thing amiss among them. Exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to diligence, both in their general and particular Callings: Entreating them who were defective, by any means to set up the Worship of God in their Houses, and to make them little Churches, by constant reading of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that so the Word of Christ might deeply dwell among, and in them richly, by careful Catechising of the Children, and the Servants, if the Governours were able; by frequent Meditations, Conferences, Repetitions of that which they had heard in publique, especially by daily Prayer, Morning and Evening, that so they might avoid that dreadful indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which hangs over, and is ready to be poured out upon the Families that call not upon God. He made the best inspecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that he could, into the state of every particular Person, and so accordingly applyed himself to check, to comfort, to encourage, as he found occasion. All which he did with so much tenderness, humility, &amp; self-denyal, that they gained very much on the affections, and respects of all that received him, and wrought them at least to outward conformity; so that they who were not visited in the beginning, at length came forth and called upon him to come to their Families and help them.</p>
                     <p>Thus did he wear himself away, and gave light and heat to others: He usually allowed himself too little sleep to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit and to repair the Spirits which he wasted with waking. His manner was to rise at four a Clock at the utmost, many times before, and that in the cold Winter Mornings, that he might be with God betime, and so get room for other studies and imployments. His extraordinary watchings, constant cares, excessive labours in the Work of his Ministry, publique and private, were generally apprehended to be the cause of those distempers and decays, and at last of that ill habit of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, whereof in the end he died.</p>
                     <p>He was the gravest, strictest, most serious, and compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed young Man that I had ever yet the happiness to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:65560:25"/>
with. And yet he was not rigid in his Principles, his moderation was known to all men that knew him.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>WHen he did Catechise the greater Sort in Publick, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was Silenced, his manner was to begin with Prayer for a Blessing upon that Exercise: And having propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed some Questions out of the <hi>Assemblies Catechism</hi> to them, he was careful, not onely to make them perfect in rehearsing the Answers there set down, but also to bring them to a clear understanding of the sence and meaning of the said Answers, and of all the Terms and Phrases in which they are expressed; And to draw some practical, useful, inferences from those Heads of Divinity contained in them. Moreover, when any distinction was necessary for the clearing up of the matter in hand; he would be also instructing his <hi>Catechumen's</hi> therein; Now this he would do, by proposing several other Collateral Questions, besides those in the <hi>Catechism;</hi> which Questions, together with the Answers to them, himself had before drawn up, and sent to them in writing.</p>
                     <p>In the Even of the Lord's Day, his course was to repeat his Sermon again, in the publick Place of Worship, where abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of People constantly resorted to hear him; which when he had done, several Youths were called forth, which did give him an Account of the Heads of all his Sermon by Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.</p>
                     <p>As for his Method in going from House to House, for the instructing of Private Families, it was this; He would give them notice of his coming the day before,</p>
                     <p>Desiring that he might have admittance to their Houses, to converse with them about their Soul-Concerns, and that they would have their whole Family together against he came.
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:65560:26"/>
When he came, and the Family were called together, he would be instructing the younger sort in the Principles of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, by asking several Questions in the <hi>Catechism;</hi> the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers to which he would be opening and explaining to them. Also he would be enquiring of them about their spiritual Estate and Condition, labouring to make them sensible of the evil and danger of Sin, the corruption and wickedness of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the misery of an unconverted State; stirring them up to look after the true Remedy proposed in the Gospel, to turn from all their sins unto GOD, to close with Christ upon his own Terms; to follow after Holiness, to watch over their Hearts and Lives, to mortifie their Lusts, to redeem their Time, to prepare for Eternity. These things as he would be explaining to their understandings, that they might have clear apprehensions about them; so he would be pressing the practice of them upon their Consciences, with the most Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Arguments and Considerations, minding them of the great Priviledges they did enjoy, the many Gospel-Sermons that they did or might hear, the many Talents they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted withal, and the great account that they had to give to the GOD of Heaven. Telling them how sad it would be with them another day, if after all this they should come short of Salvation. Besides, he would leave with them seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Counsels and Directions to be carefully remembred and practised for the good of their Souls. Those that were seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and religious, he would labour to help forward in Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, by answering their Doubts, resolving their Cases, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging them under their difficulties. And before he did go from any Family, he would deal with the Heads of that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and such others as were grown to years of discretion, singly and apart: That so he might (as much as possibly he could) come to know the condition of each particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in his Flock, and address himself in his Discourse as might be suitable to every of them. If he did perceive that they did live in the neglect of Family Duties: He would exhort and press them to set up the Worship of GOD in their Families, as Reading, Prayer, and directing them how to set about it, and to take time for secret Duties too. Such as were Masters of Families, he would earnestly perswade, and desire, as they did tender the Honour of Christ, and the welfare of their
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:65560:26"/>
Children, and Servants Souls to let them have sometime e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day for such private Duties, and to incourage them in the performance of them; neither would he leave them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had a promise of them so to do. Sometimes also he would himself go to Prayer before his departure. This was his method in the general; although with such necessary variation in his particular Visits, as the various State and Condition of the several Families did require. If the Family where he came were ignorant, he would insist the longer in Instructing and Catechizing: If loose, in reproving and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing: If Godly, in incouraging and directing.</p>
                     <p>He did use to spend five afternoons every week in such exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises, from one or two of the Clock, until seven in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: In which space of time, he would visit sometimes three or four Families in an afternoon, and sometimes more, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they were greater or less. This course he would take throughout the Town; and when he had gone through, he would presently begin again, that he might visit every Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily as often as he could. He often did bless GOD for the great success that he had in these Exercises, saying, that GOD had made him as instrumental of good to Souls this way, as by his publick Preaching, if not more. When the Ministers of this County of <hi>Somerset,</hi> at one of their Associations which heretofore they held, were debating whether, and how far it were incumbent upon them to set up private Family Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in their particular charges; Mr. <hi>Allein</hi> was the Man that they pitched upon for to draw up his Reasons for that practice, together with a Method for the more profitable ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of it.</p>

                        <p>IT being the unquestionable Duty of all the Ministers of the Church of Christ, <hi>To take heed to all the Flock over whom the Holiest hath made them Overseers;</hi> and to Teach, &amp; Preach, not only publickly, but from House to House; not onely ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a general care of the whole, or calling out the chiefest of the Sheep, for our particular Care and Inspection, as the manner of some is, and leaving the rest to sink or swim:

But as good Shepherds iniquiring into their Estates, observing the particular Marks, Diseases, Strayings of our Sheep, and applying our selves suitably to their Cases; In a word, warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every man, that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus; Therefore it behoveth us, to study to do this great Duty in such a manner, as may be acceptable to God, and profitable to our Flocks. The directions for performing this Duty, are either more general, or more special; for the more general Directions, they are either such as concern the entrance on this Duty, or the performance of it. For those that concern the Entrance:</p>

                        <p n="2">2. That we study to manage this great Work to our Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples best advantage.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. That we set apart such set-times for this great Work, as upon consideration we shall find most convenient for them and us, resolving to be constant in observing them.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. That we pray for Wisdom from Above, what, and how to speak.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. That we send word to the People, when we intend to visit them, that they dispose of their business to receive us.</p>
                        <p>For those that concern us, in the mannaging of the Duty:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The Family being called together, we may, if time and conveniency permit, begin with Prayer.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The Family, consisting of Superiours, and Inferiours, it would not be amiss to begin with the Inferious; for many can hear their Children, and Servants Examined contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that cannot bear it themselves: For that they will not disdain to give an account of themselves before their Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, though their Superiours would disdain to give account before them; and here it will be necessary to enquire into their Knowledge, Practice, States.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Their Knowledge; here we may examine what progress they have made in the Principles of the Doctrine of Christ, and try them in the Catechism.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. What they do gain by the publick Ministry, what they remember of the Sermon last heard.</p>

to inquire, if they make Conscience of secret Prayer; the necessity of it may be expressed, the nature of it opened, and some heads of Prayer explained; and if they be such as need it, it would be useful to commend to them some form, for the present help.</p>

                        <p n="1">1. That every Man by Nature is in a damnable estate.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The absolute necessity of Conversion.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. By what signs they may know whether they remain in, or are delivered from, this Estate: which signs should be few, plain, certain, and infallible, sounded upon the clear evidence of the Word; and because the searching Work is so displeasing to the Flesh, that it might disingage them to come too close at first, It may not be amiss to defer this, till we had got some interest in their Hearts, by a loving tender carriage.</p>

                        <p n="7">7. Our dealing with them, must be in that manner that may most prevail, and win upon their hearts.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>First,</hi> For the Ignorant: Our Work with them will be,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. To convince them that are Ignorant, which may be done by shewing their inability, to answer some plain familiar Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. To shew them the dangerous, yea, the damnable nature of ignorance.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. To Press them with all possible earnestness, to labour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter knowledge.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. To answer their carnal Pleas for their ignorance, when wilful.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> For the Prophane: It would be necessary to deal with them convincingly, shewing the certain damnation they are running upon.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> For the Formal: With these we must deal search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, and shew them,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. How easily Men may mistake the Form of Godliness for the Power.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Fourthly,</hi> For the Godly: To these we must draw forth the Breasts of the Promises, opening to them the riches and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> of good Works, alwayes abounding more and more.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="56" facs="tcp:65560:29"/>There is one thing more, in which his self-denyal, and other Graces, were very exemplary: Namely, his faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in reproving the miscarriages of Professors, sparing none, whether High or Low, whether Ministers or Private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians; yea, although they had been never so dear in his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and never so obliging in their carriage to him, yet if he found in them any thing that was reproveable, and blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, he would deal with them faithfully and plainly about it, whatsoever the issue and event were.</p>
                        <p>One time when he was going about such a Work, he told a Christian Friend, with whom he was very intimate and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar; <hi>Well</hi> (sayes he) <hi>I am going about that which is like to make a very dear and obliging Friend, to become an Enemy: But however, it cannot be omitted, it is better to lose mans fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, than GOD's.</hi> But GOD was pleased (then, as well as divers other times besides, when he went about business of this nature) to order things for him, better than he could have expected, and so to dispose of the heart of the Person with whom he had to deal, that he was so far from becoming his Enemy for his consciencious faithfulness to him, that he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him the better ever after as long as he lived.</p>
                        <p>As to his judgment about the <hi>Arminian</hi> Controversies, as far as I can perceive, who have discoursed with him about them, it was much-what the same with Doctor <hi>Davenants,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Baxters.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>He was a Man of a very calm and peaceable Spirit, one that loathed all tumultuous carriages and proceedings; he was far from having any other design in his Preaching, than the advancement of the Kingdom of the Lord Jesus, by the conversion and salvation of Souls: This was the mark that he had in his eye; this was that for which he laboured, and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured, and suffered, and for which he thought he could never lay out himself enough.</p>
                        <p>Though he were but a young Man, yet in his carriage he was exceeding serious and grave, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> very humble, courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and affable, condescending to discourse with the poorest and meanest Persons, for their spiritual good, as soon as with the greatest and richest.</p>
                        <p>And indeed so unblameable and convincing was he in the whole of his conversation, that there were very few religious
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:65560:29"/>
and sober Persons that knew him, either in Town or Country, either Ministers, or People, (yea, though some of them differing in judgment from him) but did highly approve of him. And for his Brethren in the Ministry here in these parts, such was his holy and discreet deportment amongst them; that he had as great an influence upon them, as few others had the like.</p>
                        <p>He was full of holy projects, often bethinking himself by what wayes and means he might more effectually promote the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Christ, and the benefit of Souls, and whatsoever he apprehended to be conducing to these highest ends, he would prosecute with that wisdom and vigour, that he seldom failed of bringing it to a comfortable and successful issue.</p>
                        <p>Of which Projects, this is one which I shall here insert. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving considered how much the Conscientious, and frequent performance of the duty of Self-Examination, might tend to the bringing down of Sin, and furtherance of Holiness, both in heart and life; He did earnestly press the said Duty on his Hearers in his Preaching, directing them in the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; and not onely so, but dealt with them also in private about it, and got a promise from the most of them, that they would every night, before they did take their rest, set about this Duty; and spend some time in secret, on purpose to call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to an account, how they had carried it that day, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing several Questions to their own hearts, which Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he had referred to several Heads, and drawn up for them in writing.</p>
                        <p>And not a few of them have acknowledged, that they have cause to bless GOD, who stirred him up to put them upon this practice, which they have found very helpful to them in their daily Christian Walk.</p>

                        <hi>Day</hi> of <hi>Humiliation,</hi> when he preached to as many as would adventure themselves with him at our own House: But it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then a strange thing to the most Professors to suffer, they seemed much afrighted at the threatnings of Adversaries; so that there was not such an appearance at such opportunities as my Husband expected; whereupon he made it his Work to converse much with those he perceived to be most time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and to satisfie the Scruples that were on many amongst us; so that the Lord was pleased in a short time to give him such success that his own People waxed bold for the Lord, and his Gospel: and multitudes flocked into the Meetings, at whatsoever season they were, either by day or night; which was a great encouragement to my Husband, that he went on with much vigour and affection in his Work, both of Preaching, and Visiting, and Catechizing, from House to House.</p>
                     <p>He went also frequently into the Villages and Places about the Towns where their Ministers were gone, as most of them did flie, or at the least desist for a considerable time after <hi>Bartholomew</hi> day: Where-ever he went, the Lord was pleased to give him great success; many converted, and the generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of those animated to cleave to the Lord and his wayes.</p>
                     <p>But by this the Justices rage was much heightned against him, and he was often threatned and sought for; but by the Power of God, whose Work he was delighted in, was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served much longer out of their hands than he expected: For he would often say, <hi>If it pleased the Lord to grant him three months liberty before he went to Prison, he should account him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self favoured by him, and should with more chearfulness go, when he had done some Work.</hi> At which time we sold off all our goods, preparing for a Goal, or Banishment, where he was desirous I should attend him, as I was willing to do, it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes having been more grievous to me to think of being ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent from him, than to suffer with him.</p>
                     <p>He also resolved, when they would suffer him no longer to stay in <hi>England,</hi> he would go to <hi>China,</hi> or some remote Part of the World, and publish the Gospel there.</p>

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:65560:33"/>
People both of the Town and Countrey were grown so reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, that they came in great multitudes, at whatever season the <hi>Meeting</hi> was appointed, very seldom missing twice a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, and often in the week: I know that he hath <hi>Preached</hi> fourteen times in eight dayes, and ten often, and six or seven ordinarily in these Months, at home and abroad, besides his frequent converse with Souls. He then laying aside all other Studies which he formerly so much delighted in, because he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted his time would be but short. And the Lord (as he often told me) made his Work in his Ministry far more easie to him, by the supplies of his Spirit both in Gifts and Grace, as did evidently appear, both in his <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Life;</hi> he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing to be more Spiritual, and Heavenly, and affectionate then before, to all that heard him, or conversed with him.</p>
                     <p>He was upon a <hi>Saturday</hi> in the evening, about six a clock, seized on by an <hi>Officer</hi> of our Town, who had rather have been otherwise imployed, as he hath often said, but that he was forced to a speedy execution of the Warrant, by a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice's Clerk, who was sent on purpose with it to see it Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, because he feared that none of the Town would have done it.</p>
                     <p>The Warrant was in the Name of three Justices, to sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon him to appear forthwith at one of their Houses, which was about two miles from the Town, but he desired liberty to stay and Sup with his Family first, supposing his Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there would be such as would require some refreshment: This would not be granted, till one of the chief of the Town was bound for his speedy appearance: His Supper being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, he sat down eating very heartily, and was very chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but full of Holy and gracious Expressions, sutable to his and our prosent state. After Supper, having prayed with us, he with the Officer, and two or three Friends accompanying him, repaired to the Justices House, where they lay to his charge, that he had broken the <hi>Act of Uniformity</hi> by his Preaching; which he denyed, saying; <hi>That he had Preached neither in any Church, nor Chappel, nor place of publick Worship since the 24th of</hi> August, <hi>and what he did was in his own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, with those others that came there to hear him.</hi>

O! how many of them am I constrained to remember, with joy for their great Worth, and sorrow for their Silence! But though Learning, Holiness, wonderful Ministerial Skill, and Industry, Moderation, Peaceableness, true Catholecism, absolute Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation unto Christ, Zeal, Patience and Perseverance, did not all seem sufficient to procure his <hi>Ministerial</hi> or <hi>Corporal</hi> Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in his latter years; yet they did much more for him than that, in qualifying him for the Crown which he now enjoyeth; and to hear, <hi>Well done good and faithful Servant, enter into thy Masters Joy.</hi>

                     <p>But, alas, Lord! What is the terrible future evil, from which thou takest such men away! And why is this World so much forsaken? As if it were not a Prayer of Hope which thou hast taught us, <hi>Thy Will be done on Earth, as it is in Heaven.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He hath Printed a small Book, called, <hi>A Call to Archippus,</hi> to perswade the silent Non-conformists, to pity Souls, and to be faithful in the Work to which they are Devoted and Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated, how dear soever it may cost them.</p>
                     <p>He held that Separation in a Church was necessary many times from the known corruptions of it. But allowed not Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from a Church, where Active Complyance with some sinful Evil, was not made the Condition of Communion. And in this way he frequently declared himself in Health and Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and most expresly in my hearing on his Bed of Languishing, when he was drawing near his Long-Home.</p>
                     <p>And that the People were not disobliged from attending up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Ministry, who were ejected out of their Places, as his Book entituled <hi>A Call to Archippus</hi> sheweth; after that Black and Mournful Sabbath, in which he took his farewel with much affection of his Beloved People.</p>
                     <p>When he was taken up for Prison, he was not onely conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but joyful to suffer for the Name of Jesus and his Gospel, which was so dear to him; Intimating, that God had given
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:65560:34"/>
him much more] time than he expected, or askt of him, and that he accounted it cause of rejoycing, and his honour, that he was one of the first called forth to suffer for his name.</p>
                     <p>Although he was very suddenly surprised, yet none could dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern him to be in the least moved.</p>
                     <p>He pitied the condition of his Enemies, requesting for them, as the Martyr <hi>Stephen</hi> did for those that stoned him, <hi>That God would not lay this sin of theirs to their charge.</hi> The greatest harm that he did wish to any of them, was, <hi>That they might throughly be Converted and Sanctified, and that their Souls might be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He was very urgent with those that were Unconverted, to look with more care after their Salvation, now they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from them that longed for it, and had watched for their Souls; using this as an Argument often, That now they were fallen into the hands of such, many of which, if not most of them, had neither Skill nor Will to save Souls: And setting home upon them with most tender Affections, what mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable Creatures they were while Unregenerate, telling them how his Heart did yearn for them, and his Bowels turned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him for them; how he did pray and weep for them, while they were asleep, and how willingly he had suffered a years Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment: Nay, how readily he could shed his Blood to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure their Salvation. His Counsels and Directions were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and suited to the several states of those he thus Conversed with, both as to their degree and place, and their sins and wants, and would be too long to recite, though I can remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber many of them.</p>
                     <p>To his fellow Prisoners, he said, <hi>The Eyes of GOD and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are upon you, and the eyes of Men are upon you; now you will be critically observed. Every one will be looking that you should be more Holy than others, that are called forth to this his glorious Dignity, to be the Witnesses of Christ Jesus, with the loss of your Liberties.</hi>

                        <pb n="67" facs="tcp:65560:34"/>And yet they accused him of being at a <hi>Riotous Assembly,</hi> though there were no Threats, nor dangerous Words; no Staves, nor Weapons, no Fear so much as pretended to be struck into any man, nor any other Business met about, then Preaching and Prayer. Here he was much abused, receiving many scorns and scoffs from the Justices, and their Associ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a es, who were met to hear his Examination, also from the Ladies and other Gentlemen, who called him often Rogue, and told him, he deserved to be Hang'd, and if he were not, they would be Hang'd for him: With many such like scurrilous Passages, which my Husband received with much patience; and seeming, as they apprehended by his Countenance, to slight their Threatnings, they were more inraged at him: They urged him much to accuse himself, which they seeing they could not bring him to; and having no evidence, as appeared after, yet did make his Mittimus for to go to the Goal on Monday Morning, after they had detained him till twelve at Night, abusing him beyond what I do now distinctly remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, or were fit to express.</p>
                     <p>As soon as he returned, it being so late, about two a Clock, he lay down on the Bed in his Clothes, where he had not slept above two or three hours at the most, but he was up, spending his time in Converse with God, till about eight a Clock; by which hour, several of his Friends were come to Visit him: But he was so watched, and the Officer had such a charge, that he was not suffered to Preach all that Sabbath, but spent the day in discoursing with the various Companies, that came flocking in from the Town, and Villages, to visit him; Praying often with them, as he could be permitted. He was exceeding chearful in his Spirit, full of admirations of the Mercies of God, and incouraging all that came to be bold, and venture for the Gospel, and their Souls, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing what was come upon him for their sakes: For, as he told them, he was not at all moved at at, nor did not in the least repent of any thing he had done, but accounted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self happy, and under that Promise Christ makes to his, in the <hi>5th</hi> of <hi>Matthew,</hi> That he should be doubly and trebly blessed now he was to suffer for his sake: And was very earnest with his Brethren in the Ministry, that came to see him, That they would not in the least desist when he was gone, that
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:65560:35"/>
there might not be one Sermon the less in <hi>Taunton;</hi> and with the People to attend the Ministry with greater Ardency, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligency, and courage, than before; assuring them how sweet and comfortable it was to him to consider what he had done for God in the months past: And that he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Prison full of Joy, being confident that all these things would turn to the furtherance of the Gospel, and the Glory of God.</p>
                     <p>But he not being satisfied to go away, and not leave some exhortations with his People, he appointed them to meet him about one or two a Clock in the Night, to which they shewed their readiness, though at so unseasonable a time: There was of Young and Old, many hundreds; he Preached and Prayed with them about three hours.</p>
                     <p>And so with many yearnings of his Bowels towards them, and theirs toward him, they took their farewel of each other; a more affectionate Parting could not well be.</p>
                     <p>About nine a Clock, he with two or three Friends that were willing to accompany him, set out for <hi>Ilchester:</hi> The Streets were lined on both sides with People, and many followed him a foot some miles out of the Town, with such lamentations, (that he told me after) did so affect him, that he could scarce bear them; but the Lord so strengthned him, that he passed through them all with great Courage and Joy, labouring both by his chearful Countenance and Expressions, to encourage them.</p>
                     <p>He carried his Mittimus himself, and had no Officer with him; but when he came there, he found the Goaler absent, and took that opportunity to Preach before he went into the Prison; which was accounted by his Adversaries, a great addition to his former Crime. As soon as the Goaler came, he delivered his Mittimus, and was clapped up in the <hi>Bridewel</hi> Chamber, which was over the common Goal. When he came to the Prison, he found there Mr. <hi>John Norman,</hi> late Minister of <hi>Bridgwater,</hi> who for the like cause, was Apprehended and Committed a few dayes before him, (a Man, who for his singular Abilities in Preaching, his fervent Zeal, and Holy Boldness in the Cause of Christ, his Constancy to his Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in the most Wavering and Shaking Times, joyned with an exemplary Carriage and Conversation, was deservedly had
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:65560:35"/>
in great repute among the People of God in these <hi>Western</hi> parts; and indeed there were very few that knew him, either among the sober Gentry, or Commonalty; but for his emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Parts, and spotless Life, had great respects for him.) There were also five more Ministers, with fifty <hi>Quakers,</hi> which had all their Lodgings in the same Room, only parted with a Mat, which they had done for a little more Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It was not long after before Mr. <hi>Coven,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Powel,</hi> with eight more, were brought into the same place, being taken at Meetings; which made their Rooms very straight, and it was so nigh to the upper part of the Prison, that they could touch the Tiles as they lay in their Beds; which made it very irksom, the Sun lying so hot on it all the day, and there being so many of them, and so much Resort continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of Friends, they had very little Air, till they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to take down the Glass, and some of the Tiles, to let in some Refreshment. But here they were confined to Lie, and eat their Meals, and had no place but a small Garden, joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the place where all the Common Prisoners were; which was no Retirement for them, they having there, and in their Chamber, the constaut noise of those Wretches, except when they slept; who lay just under them, their Chains ratling, their Tongues often Blaspheming; or else Roaring and Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Night, as well as in the Day: And if they went into the Courts of the Prison, there was the sight of their Clothes hanging full of Vermin, and themselves in their Rags and Chains: But that which was most grievous to them, they had no place to retire to God in, neither alone, nor together. They were also much molested by the <hi>Quakers,</hi> who would frequently disturb them by their Cavils, in the times of their Preaching, Praying, and Singing, and would come and work in their Callings just by them, while they were in Duties, which was no small disturbance to them: And the want of the Air was more to my Husband, than to most of them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he alwayes accustomed himself, both in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to spend his most secret Hours abroad in by-Places, in the Fields or Woods.</p>
                     <p>As soon as he came into the Prison, he Preached and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he called the <hi>Consecration</hi> of it. After he had spent a day or two in the Prison, being willing to have me either
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:65560:36"/>
in the Town, or there, to attend him, and to keep compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with his Friends, who came frequently to visit him, he then began to fit up his Lodging; having prevailed with the Keeper for one Corner, which was more private than the rest, to set his Bed in, about which he made a little Partition by some Curtains, that so he might have some conveniency for Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This was much comfort to him, and after a few Weeks, he got leave of the Keeper to go out a Mornings and Evenings a mile or more, which he did constantly, unless the Weather, or his Keepers fury did hinder him.</p>
                     <p>Their Diet was very good and sufficient, and sometimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant, by their Friends kindness. Here they Preach once a day coustantly, sometimes twice, and many came daily to hear them, eight or ten miles round about the Countrey; and Multitudes came to visit them, it being a strange sight to see Ministers laid in such a place. Their Friends were exceeding kind to them, endeavouring by their frequents Visits, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions for Diet, and supplies of Money, to make their Prison sweet to them.</p>
                     <p>But my Husbands Labours were much increased by this, spending all the day in converse, he was forced to take much of the Night for his Studies, and secret Converse with God.</p>
                     <p>Thus he with my Brother <hi>Norman,</hi> and his Company, with their fellow Prisoners, continued in that place for four Months, being tossed from Sessions to Assizes. On the 14th of <hi>July</hi> following, he was brought to the Sessions held at <hi>Taunton,</hi> and was there Indited for Preaching on <hi>May</hi> the 17th, but the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence against him was so slender, that the <hi>Grand Jury</hi> could not find the Bill, so that he was not brought to his Answer there at all: And his Friends hoped he should have been dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missed, it being the constant practice of the Court, that if a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner be Indited, and no Bill found, he is Freed by Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, But however, my Husband was sent to Prison again un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the Assizes; and to his Friends that earnestly expected his Inlargement, he said, <hi>Let us bless God that his Will is done, and not the will of such Worms as we.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>August</hi> the 24th, He was again Indited at the Assizes, and though the Evidence was the very same, that at the Sessions was by the <hi>Grand Jury,</hi> judged Insufficient yet now at the Assizes, the Bill was by them found against him. So was he
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:65560:36"/>
had to the Bar, and his Indictment read, which was to this purpose: <hi>That he, upon the</hi> 17th <hi>day of</hi> May, 1663. <hi>with twenty others, to the Jurors unknown, did Riotously, Rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tously, and Seditiously, Assemble themselves together, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Peace of our Sovereign Lord the King, and to the great Terrour of his Subjects, and to the evil Example of others.</hi> Unto which, his Answer was, <hi>That as to Preaching, and Praying, which was the truth of the Case, of these things he was guilty, and did own them as his Duty; but as for Riotous Routous, and Seditious Assemblies, he did abhor them with his Heart, and of these he was not guilty.</hi> At last he was found guilty by the <hi>Petty Jury,</hi> and was Sentenced by the Judge to pay an Hundred Marks, and to lie in Prison till pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment should be made. Sentence being pronounced against him, he only made this brief Reply: <hi>That he was glad that it had appeared before his Countrey, That whatsoever he was charged with, he was guilty of nothing but doing his Duty, and that all did <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>But the Winter coming on, they were willing to try if they could have the favour to be removed to the <hi>Ward,</hi> this place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like to be as cold in the Winter, as it had been hot in the Summer, (there being no Chimney in the whole Chamber) which with some difficulty they obtained; and then had more comfortable Accomodations in all respects.</p>
                     <p>Here they had very great Meetings, Week-dayes, and Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-dayes, and many dayes of Humiliation, and Thanksgiving. The Lords-dayes many Hundreds came. And though my Husband, and Brother <hi>Norman,</hi> had many Threats from the Justices and Judges, That they should be sent beyond Sea, or carried to some Island, where they should be kept close Prisoners; yet the Lord preserved them by his Power, and thus ordered it, that their Imprisonment was a great further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the Gospel, and brought much Glory to him, both
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:65560:37"/>
by their Preaching and Conversing with Souls: In which they had great Success through his Blessing on their Labours. My Husband having here more freedom, made a little Book, Enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled <hi>A Call to Archippus,</hi> to stir up his Non-conforming Brethren, to be diligent at their Work, whatsoever Dangers and Sufferings they might meet withal: And because he could not go to his Flock, he had prepared for them, <hi>The Synop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis of the Covenant,</hi> which was after placed into one of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Books.</p>
                     <p>And for the help of the Governours of Families, in their Weekly Catechizing those under their charge, he <hi>explained all the Assemblies shorter Chatechism;</hi> to which he annexed an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate Letter, with Rules for their daily Examination; which were Printed and Dispersed into all their Houses by his Orde, while he was a Prisoner. He also writ many Holy, and Gracious, and affectionate Letters to all his Relations, and many other Friends, to many Churches of Christ in other parts and places, both far and near.</p>
                     <p>His Sufferings that he underwent for the sake of the Gospel, could neither remit his Zeal, not abate his Activity for God, but he would gladly imbrace all Opportunities of doing him Service. The Minister who was appointed to Preach at cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain times to the Fellons in the Prison, being by sickness disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for that Work, he freely performed that Office among them, as long as he was permitted; earnestly exhorting them by Repentance towards God, and Faith toward our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, to secure the eternal welfare of their Souls; freely bestowing upon them, according to his Ability, for their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; that by doing good to their Bodies, he might win upon them to receive good for their Souls. He was very forward to promote the Education of Youth, in the Town of <hi>Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester,</hi> and Country adjacent, freely bestowing Catechisms on those that were of poor Families, to instruct them in the Principles of Religion; stirring up the Elder to Teach, and incouraging the Younger to Learn. He was a serious and faithful Monitor to his fellow Sufferers, if he espyed any thing in any of them, that did not become the Gospel, for which they suffered.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="65" facs="tcp:65560:37"/>Here, as else-where, he was a careful redeemer of his time his constant practice was, early to begin the day with God, rising about four of the Clock, and spending a considerable part of the Morning in Meditation and Prayer, and then fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling close to his Study, in some corner or other of the Prison, where he could be private. At times, he would spend near the whole Night in these Exercises, not putting off his Clothes at all, onely taking the repose of an hour or two in his Night-Gown upon the Bed, and so up again. When any came to visit him, he did not entertain them with needless imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Discourse, but that which was serious, profitable, and edifying; in which he was careful to apply himself to them, according to their several capacities, whether Elder or Younger; exhorting them to those gracious Practices, which by reason of their Age, or Temper, Calling, or Condition, he apprehended they might be most defective in, and dehort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them from those Evils they might be most prone and lya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto. He rejoyced that he was accounted worthy to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for the Work of Christ; and he would labour to incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the timerous and faint-hearted, by his own and others experience, of the Mercy and Goodness of God in Prison, which was far beyond what they could have thought or expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. He was a careful observer of that Rule of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 44. <hi>Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that despitefully use you, and persecute you.</hi> It was none of his practice to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim against those that were the greatest Instruments of his Sufferings.</p>
                     <p>In all his Imprisonment, at present, I could not discern his Health to be the least impaired, notwithstanding his abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant Labours; but cannot but suspect, as the Physitians judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he had laid the foundation for that Weakness, which suddenly after surprised him, and was his death.</p>
                     <p>At his return from the Prison, he was far more <hi>earnest in his Work than before;</hi> yet willing to preserve his liberty among his People, who had no Minister that had the oversight of them, though some came and preached while he was absent: And the People flocked so greatly after him, that he judged it best to divide the Company into four, and resolved to Preach four times each Sabbath to them: But finding sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:65560:38"/>
that would be too hard for him, his strength much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caying, he did forbear that course, and preacht only twice a Sabbath as formerly, and often on Week-days at Home and in the Countrey; and spent what time he had else from his studying, in private converse with God, as formerly he had done: Pressing all that feared the Lord, especially those that were of a more weak and timerous Spirit, to a life of Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Activity for God, and to be much in helping one another, by their Converses, now Ministers were withdrawn; and to be much in the Work of Praises and Thanksgiving to God, rejoycing and delighting themselves in him; and with chearfulness and readiness, denying themselves for him, and resigning themselves, and all they did enjoy, to him: Letting the World know, they could live comfortably on a God alone, on his Attributes and Promises, though they should have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else left.</p>
                     <p>But it pleased the All-wise God, to take him off from the eager pursuit of his Work, and designs for him, by visiting him in the later end of <hi>August,</hi> with much Weakness, so that he had not above three months time after he came out of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: For he going about sixteen miles, at the request of a Society, whose Pastor was not able to come among them to Preach, and to Administer a more solemn Ordinance; he was so disabled, that he was able not to perform the great and chief Work, though he did adventure to Preach, but with much injury to himself, because he would not wholly disappoint the People, who came so far as many of them did: With much difficulty, after three or four dayes, I made way to get him home to <hi>Taunton,</hi> where we then sojourned, and presently had the best Advice the most Able Physitians, both in and round the Town, could give; who advised together, and all judged it to be from his abundant Labours, and the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too soon after his Meals; as he did, when he Preacht four times a Sabbath, whereby he had so abated the natural heat of his Stomach, that no Food would digest, nor oftentimes keep within him: He would assure us, he was in no pain, but a constant discomposure in his Stomach, and a failing of his Appetite, that he could not for many Weeks bear the scent of any Flesh-meat, nor retain any Liquors or Broths, so that he consumed so fast, that his Life seemed to draw to
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:65560:38"/>
an end: But the Lord did so bless the means, that he reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered out of this Distemper, after two months time, but so lost the use of his Arms from <hi>October</hi> till <hi>April,</hi> that he could not put off nor on his Clothes, nor often write either his Notes, or any Letters, but as I wrote for him, as he dictated to me: He was by all Physitians, and by my earnest beseechings often diswaded from Preaching, but would not be prevailed with, but did go on once, and sometimes twice a Sabbath, and in his private Visiting all that Winter; in the Spring, the use of his Arms returned, for which he was exceeding thankful to the Lord; and we had great hopes of his Recovering; and making use of further Remedies, he was able to go on with more freedom in his Work: And the Summer following, by the use of Mineral-Waters in <hi>Wiltshire,</hi> near the <hi>Devises,</hi> where he was born, his strength was much increased, he finding great and sensible good by them.</p>
                     <p>But he venturing too much on what he had obtained, his weakness returned frequently upon him the next Winter, and more in the Spring following, being seised as he was at the first: But it continued not long at a time, so that he did Preach of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to his utmost strength (nay, I may say, much beyond the strength he had) both at Home and Abroad; going into some remote parts of the Countrey, where had been no Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings kept all that time the Ministers had been out, which was two Years: And there he ingaged several of his Brethren to go and take their turns, which they did with great success.</p>
                     <p>He had also agreed with two of his Brethren to go into <hi>Wales</hi> with them, to spread the Gospel there; but was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented in that, by his weakness increasing upon him: It was much that he did, but much more that he desired to do.</p>
                     <p>He was in this time much Threatned, and Warrants often out for him; and he was so far from being disturbed at it, that he rejoyced; that when he could do but little for God, because of his Distempers, God would so far honour him, that he should go and suffer for him in a Prison. He would often with chearfulness say, <hi>They could not do him a greater kindness:</hi> But the Lord was yet pleased to preserve him from their rage, seeing him not then fit for the inconveniencies of a Prison.</p>
                     <p>The five Mile Act coming in force, he removed to a place
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:65560:39"/>
called <hi>Wellington,</hi> which is reckoned five miles from <hi>Taunton,</hi> to a Dyers House, in a very obscure place, where he preached on the Lord's-Dayes, as he was able: But the vigilant Eyes of his old Adversaries were so watchful over him, that they soon found him out, and resolved to take him thence, and had put a Warrant into the Constables hand to apprehend him, and sent for our Friend, and threatned to send him to Goal for entertaining such persons in his House: So my Husband re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the House of Mr. <hi>John Mallack,</hi> a Merchant, who lived about a mile from <hi>Taunton,</hi> who had long solicited him to take his House for his Home: We being in such an unsetled state, my Husband thought it best to accept of his courteous of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer: But many of his Friends were willing to enjoy him in the Town, and so earnest, that he did, to satisfie them, go from one to another, staying a fortnight, or three weeks, or a month at each House; but still took Mr. <hi>Mallacks</hi> for his Home: This motion of his Friends he told me, (though it was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome for us to be so unsetled) he was willing to embrace, because he knew not how soon he might be carried again from them to Prison, and he should have opportunity to be more intimately acquainted with them, and the state of their Souls; and of their Children and Servants, and how they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their Duties each to other in their Families.</p>
                     <p>He went from no House without serious Counsels, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, or Reproofs, as their Conditions called for; dealing with all that were capable, both Governours and others particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, acquainting them faithfully and most affectionately, what he had seen amiss in any of them.</p>
                     <p>He went from no House that was willing to part with him; nor had he opportunity to answer the requests of half that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited us to their Houses: So that he would often bless God, and say with holy Mr. <hi>Dod, That he had a hundred Houses for one that he had parted with;</hi> and though he had no Goods, he wanted nothing, his Father cared for him in every thing, that he lived a far more pleasant life than his Enemies, who had turned him out of all: He was exceedingly taken with God's Mercy to him, in Mr. <hi>Mallacks</hi> entertaining him and me so bountifully, the House, and Gardens, and Walks, being a very great delight to him, being so Pleasant and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and all Accommodations within suitable, so that he

would often say, That he did as <hi>Dives,</hi> fare deliciously every day: But he hoped he should improve it better than he did, and that God had inclined him to take care for many Poor, and for several of his Brethren in the Ministry; and now God did reward him, by not suffering him to be at the least expence for himself or me.</p>
                     <p>He was a very strict observer of all Providences of every day, and did usually reckon them up to me before we went to sleep, each night after he came into his Chamber and Bed, to raise his own Heart and Mind, to praise the Lord, and to trust him, whom we had such experience of, from time to time.</p>
                     <p>The time of the Year being come for his going to the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, he was desirous to set one day apart for thanksgiving to God, for all his Mercies to him and them, and so to take his leave of them.</p>
                     <p>Accordingly, on the 10th of <hi>July,</hi> 1665. divers of his Brethren in the Ministry, and many of his Friends of <hi>Taunton,</hi> met together to take their leave of him before his departure, at the House of Mr. <hi>Mallack,</hi> then living about a mile out of the Town. Where after they had been a while together, came two Justices, and several other Persons attending them, brake open the Doors by force, (though they might have unlatched them if they had pleased) and with Swords came in among them. After much deriding and menacing Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, which I shall not here relate, having taken their Names, committed them to the custody of some Constables, whom they charged to bring them forth the next day, at the <hi>Castle</hi> Tavern in <hi>Taunton,</hi> before the Justices of the Peace there. The next day the Prisoners appeared, and answered to their Names; and after two dayes tedious attendance, were all Convicted of a Conventicle, and Sentenced to pay three Pounds a piece, or to be committed to Prison threescore dayes. Of the Persons thus Convicted, but few either paid their Fines, or suffered their Friends to do it for them. My Husband, with seven Ministers more, and forty private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, were committed to the Prison of <hi>Ilchester:</hi> When he, together with the rest of his Brethrtn and Christian Friends, came to the Prison, his Carriage and Conversation there was every way as Exemplary, as in his former Confinement.
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:65560:40"/>
Notwithstanding his weakness of Body, yet he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly take his turn with the rest of the Ministers, in preaching the Gospel in the Prison; which turns came about the oftner, though there were eight of them there together, because they had Preaching and Praying twice a day, almost every day they were in Prison; besides other Exercises of Religion, in which he would take his part.</p>
                     <p>And although he had many of his Flock confined to the Prison with him, by which means he had the fairer opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Instructing, and watching over them, for their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual good; yet he was not forgetful of the rest that were left behind, but would frequently visit them also, by his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, full of serious profitable Matter, from which they might reap no small benefit, while they were debarred of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily presence. And how greatly solicitous he was for those that were with him, (that they might be the better for their Bonds, walking worthy of the many and great Mercies they had enjoyed during their Imprisonment; that when they came home to their Houses, they might speak forth, and live forth the Praises of GOD, carrying themselves in every respect as becomes the Gospel, for which they had been Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers) you may clearly see by those parting Counsels that he gave them that Morning that they were delivered, which I shall recite in his own Words, as they were taken from his Mouth in Short-hand, by an intimate Friend, and fellow Prisoner, which you may take as followeth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <p>DEarly Beloved Brethren, my Time is little, and my Strength but small, yet I could not consent that you should pass without receiving some parting Counsel, and what I have to say at Parting, shall be chiefly to you that are Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners, and partly also to you our Friends, that are here

met together. To you that are Prisoners, I shall speak some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by way of Exhortation, and something by way of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation.</p>

                           <head>By way of Exhortation.</head>
                           <p>
                              <hi>First,</hi> Rejoyce with trembling in your Prison-Comforts, and see that you keep them in a Thankful-Remembrance. Who can tell the Mercies that you have received here? My time, nor strength, will not suffice me to recapitulate them. See that you rejoyce in GOD, but rejoyce with trembling. Do not think the account will be little for Mercies, so many and so great. Receive these choice Mercies with a trembling hand, for fear lest you should be found guilty of misimpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving such precious benefits, and so wrath should be upon you from the Lord. Remember <hi>Hezekiah's</hi> case, great Mercies did he receive, some Praises he did return, but not according to the benefit done unto him; therefore was wrath upon him from the Lord, and upon all <hi>Judah</hi> for his sake, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32. 25. Therefore go away with a holy Fear upon your hearts, lest you should forget the loving kindness of the Lord, and should not render to him according to what you have received.</p>
                           <p>Oh my Brethren, stir up your selves to render praises to the Lord: You are the People that GOD hath formed for his Praise, and sent hither for his Praise; and you should now go Home as so many Trumpets to sound forth the Praises of GOD, when you come among your Friends. There is an Expression, <hi>Psal.</hi> 68. 11. <hi>The Lord gave the Word, great was the company of them that published it.</hi> So let it be said of the Praises of God now, Great was the company of them that published them. GOD hath sent a whole Troop of you here together, let all these go home and sound the praises of GOD where-ever you come; and this is the way to make his Praise glorious indeed. Shall I tell you a Story that I have read: There was a certain King that had a pleasant Grove, and that he might make it every way delightful to him, he caused some Birds to be caught, and to be kept up in Cages, till they had learned sundry sweet and artificial Tunes; and when they were perfect in their Lessons, he let them Abroad out of their Cages into his Grove, that while he was walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:65560:41"/>
in this Grove, he might hear them singing those pleasant Tunes, and teaching them to other Birds that were of a wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Note. Brethren, this King is GOD, this Grove is his Church, these Birds are your selves, this Cage is the Prison; GOD hath sent you hither, that you should learn the sweet and pleasant Notes of his Praise, And I trust that you have learned something all this while, GOD forbid else. Now GOD opens the Cage, and lets you forth into the Grove of his Church, that you may sing forth his Praises, and that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may learn of you too. Forget not therefore the Songs of the House of your Pilgrimage, do not return to your wild Notes again; keep the Mercy of GOD for ever in a thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Remembrance, and make mention of them humbly as long as you live; then shall you answer the end for which he sent you hither: I trust you will not forget this place. When Queen <hi>Mary</hi> died, she said, <hi>That if they did rip her up, they should find</hi> Callis <hi>on her Heart.</hi> I hope that men shall find by you hereafter, that the Prison is upon your heart, <hi>Lichester</hi> is upon your heart.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Secondly,</hi> Feed and feast your Faith upon Prison-Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. Do not think that GOD hath done this onely for your present supply. Brethren, GOD hath provided for you, not only for your present supply in Prison, but to lay up for all your Lives, that experience that your Faith must live upon, till Faith be turned into Vision. Learn dependance upon GOD, and confidence in GOD, by all the Experiences that you have had here, <hi>Because thou hast been my help</hi> (saith the Psalmist) <hi>therefore under the shadow of thy Wing will I rejoyce.</hi> Are you at a loss at any time, then remember your Bonds. We read in Scripture of a time when there was no <hi>Smith</hi> in all <hi>Israel,</hi> and the <hi>Israelites</hi> were fain to carry their Goads and other Instruments, to be sharpened, down to the <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stines:</hi> So when your Spirits are low, and when your Faith is dull, carry them to the Prison to be sharpened and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Oh how hath the Lord confuted all our fears! Cared for all our necessities! The Faith of some of you was sorely put to it for Corporal Necessities: You came hither, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any thing considerable to pay for your Charges here, but GOD took care for that: And you left poor miserable Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies at home, and no doubt but many troublesome thoughts
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:65560:41"/>
were in your minds, what your Families should do for Bread, but GOD hath provided for them.</p>
                           <p>We that are Ministers, left poor starvling Flocks, and we thought that the Countrey had been now stript, and yet GOD hath provided for them. Thus hath the Lord been pleased to furnish us with Arguments for our Faith, against we come to the next distress: Though you should be called forth to leave your Flocks destitute, you that are my Brethren in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, and others their Families destitute, yet doubt not but GOD will provide, remember your Bonds upon all occasions. Whensoever you are in distress, remember your old Friend, remember your tryed Friend.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Let Divine Mercy be as Oyl to the flame of your Love: <hi>O love the Lord all ye his Saints.</hi> Brethren, this is the Language of all GOD's dealings with you, they all call upon you to love the Lord your God with all your hearts, with all your Souls, with all your strength. What hath GOD been doing ever since you came to this Prison? All that he hath been doing since you came hither, hath been to pour Oyl into the flames of your Love, thereby to encrease and heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten them. GOD hath lost all these Mercies upon you, if you do not love him better then you did before. You have had supplies; to what purpose is it, unless you love GOD the more? If they that be in want, love him better than you, it were better you had been in their case. You have had health here, but if they that be in sickness love GOD better than you, it were better you had been in sickness too: See that you love your Father, that hath been so tender of you. What hath GOD been doing, but pouring out his Love upon you? How were we mistaken? For my part, I thought that GOD took us upon his Knee to Whip us, but he took us upon his Knee to Dandle us. We thought to have felt the strokes of his Anger, but he hath stroked us as a Father his Children, with most dear Affection. Who can utter his loving Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness! What (my Brethren) shall we be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                                 <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                              </gap> than <hi>Publicans?</hi> the <hi>Publicans</hi> will love those that love them. Will not you return Love for so much Love? Far be this from you, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, you must not only exceed the <hi>
                                 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                                    <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                                 </gap>,</hi> but the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees</hi> too; therefore, surely you must love him that loveth you. This is my Business now to bespeak your love to GOD,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:65560:42"/>
to unite your hearts to him; Blessed be God for this Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, for my part I am unworthy of it. Now if I can get your Hearts nearer to GOD than they were, then happy am I, and blessed are you: Fain I would, that all these Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences should knit our Hearts to GOD more, and endear us for ever to him. What? So much bounty and kindness, and no returns of Love? At least no further returns? I may plead in the behalf of the Lord with you, as they did for the Centurion: <hi>He loveth our Nation</hi> (say they) <hi>and hath built us a Synagogue.</hi> So I may say here, He hath loved you, and poured out his Bounty upon you. How many friendly Visits from those that you could but little expect of? Whence do you think this came? It is GOD that hath the Key of all these Hearts. He secretly turned the Cock, and caused them to pour forth kindness upon you: There is not a motion of love in the Heart of a Friend towards you, but it was GOD that put it in.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Keep your Manna in a Golden Pot, and forget not him that hath said so often, <hi>Remember me.</hi> You have had Manna rained plentifully about you, be sure that something of it be kept. Do not forget all the Sermons that you have heard here: O that you would labour to repeat them over, to live them over! You have had such a Stock that you may live upon, and your Friends too (if you be communicative) a great while together: If any thing have been wanting, time for the Digesting hath been wanting. See that you well Chew the Cud, and see that you especially remember <hi>the Feasts of Love.</hi> Do not you know who hath said to you so often, <hi>Remember me?</hi> How often have you heard that sweet Word since you came hither? What? Do you think it is enough to remember him for an hour? No, but let it be a living and lasting remembrance. Do not you write that Name of his in the Dust, that hath written your Names upon his Heart. Your High Priest hath your Names upon his Heart, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with is entered into the Holy Place, and keeps them there for a Memorial before the Lord continually. O that his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance might be ever written upon your Hearts, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as with a Pen of a Diamond, upon Tables of Marble, that might never be worn out! That as <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith of the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Fabrick of <hi>Minerva,</hi> that he had so ordered the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:65560:42"/>
that his Name was written in the midst, that if any went to take that out, the whole Fabrick was dissolved. So the Name of <hi>Jesus</hi> should be written upon the substance of your Souls, that they should pull all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                                 <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                              </gap>, before they should be able to pull it out.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Let the Bonds of your Affliction, strengthen the Bonds of your Affection. Brethren, GOD hath sent us hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to teach us among other things, the better to Love one another. Love is lovely, both in the sight of GOD and Men, and if by your Imprisonment you have profited in Love, then you have made an acceptable proficiency. O Brethren, look within; Are you not more indeared one to another? I bless the Lord for that Union and Peace that hath been ever among you; but you must be sensible that we come very far short of that Love that we owe one to another; we have not that love, that indearedness, that tenderness, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency, that compassion towards each other, that we ought to have. Ministers should be more indeared one to another, and Christians should be more dear to each other, then they were before. We have eaten and drunk together, and lived on our Fathers Love in one Family together; we have been joyned together in one common Cause, and all put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one Bottom: O let the Remembrance of a Prison, and of what hath passed here, especially those Uniting Feasts, ingage you to love one another.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Let present Indulgence fit you for future hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships, and do not look that your Father should be alwayes dandling you on his Knee. Beloved, GOD hath used you like Fondlings now, rather than like Sufferers: What shall I say? I am at a loss, when I think of the tender indulgence, and the yearnings of the Bowels of our Heavenly Father upon us. But (my Brethren) do not look for such Prisons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
                           <p>Affliction doth but now play and sport with you, rather than Bite you; but do you look that Affliction should here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after fasten its Teeth on you to purpose: And do you look that the Hand that hath now gently stroked you, may possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly buffet you, and put your Faith hard to it, when you come to the next Tryal. This fondness of your Heavenly Father, is to be expected only while you are young and tender, but
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:65560:43"/>
afterward you must look to follow your Business, and to keep your distance, and to have rebukes and frowns too when you need them. Bless GOD for what you have found here, but prepare you, this is but the beginning, (shall I say the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Sorrow, I cannot say so; for the Lord hath made it a place of Rejoycing) this is but the entrance of our Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but you must look, that when you are trained up to a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter perfection, GOD will put your Faith to harder Exercise.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Cast up your accounts at your Return, and see whether you have gone as much forward in your Souls, as you have gone backward in your Estates. I cannot be insensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but some of you are here to very great disadvantage, as to your Affairs in the World, having left your business so rawly at home in your Shops, Trades, and Callings, that it is like to be no little detriment to you, upon this Account: But happy are ye, if you find at your return, that as much as your Affairs are gone backward, and behind-hand, so much your Souls have gone forward. If your Souls go forward in Grace by your Sufferings, blessed be GOD that hath brought you to such a place as a Prison is.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Eightly,</hi> Let the Snuffers of this Prison make your Light burn the brighter, and see that your Course and Discourse be the more savoury, serious, and Spiritual for this present Tryal. O Brethren! Now the Voice of the Lord is to you, as it is in the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> 60. 1. <hi>Arise, and shine, now let your Light shine before men, that others may see your good Works, and glorifie your Father which is in Heaven.</hi> It is said of those Preachers beyond Sea, that have been sent into <hi>England,</hi> and here reaped the benefit of our <hi>English</hi> practical Divinity: At their Return, they have Preached so much better than they had wont to do, that it hath been said of them: <hi>Apparuit hunc fuisse in</hi> Angliâ. So do you my Brethren, Live so much better than you had wont, that when men shall see the change in your Lives, they may say of you, <hi>Apparuit hunc fuisse in Custodiâ.</hi> See that your whole Course and Discourse be more Spiritual and Heavenly than ever. See that you shine in your Families when you come Home; be you better Husbands, better Masters, better Fathers, study to do more than you have done this way, and to approve your selves better in your Family-Relations than you did before; that the savour
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:65560:43"/>
of a Prison may be upon you in all Companies, then will you praise and please the Lord.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Ninthly,</hi> And lastly, See that you walk <hi>Accurately,</hi> as those that have the Eyes of GOD, Angels, and Men, upon you: (my Brethren) you will be looked upon now with very cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Eyes. GOD doth expect more of you than ever; for he hath done more for you, and he looketh what Fruit there will be of all this. Oh! may there be a sensible change upon your Souls, by the Showres that have fallen in Prison, as there is in the greenness of the Earth, by the showres that have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len lately abroad.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div type="subsection">
                           <head>By way of Dehortation also, I have these four things to Leave with you.</head>
                           <p>
                              <hi>First,</hi> Revile not your Persecutors, but bless them, and pray for them, as the Instruments of conveying great Mercies to you. Do not you so far forget the Rule of Christ, as when you come home, to be setting your Mouths to talk against those that have injured you. Remember the Command of your Lord, <hi>Bless them that curse you, pray for them that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitefully use you, and persecute you.</hi> Whatsoever they intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet they have been Instruments of a great deal of Mercy to us; and so we should pray for them, and bless GOD for the good we have received by them.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Secondly,</hi> Let not the humble acknowledgment of GOD's Mercy degenerate into proud, Vain-glorious boasting, or Carnal-tryumph. I beseech you, see that you go home with a great deal of fear upon your Spirits in this respect, left pride should get advantage of you, left instead of humble acknowledging GOD's Mercy, there should be Carnal boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Beware of this, I earnestly beg of you, for this will ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much spoyl your Sufferings, and be very displeasing in the sight of GOD. But let your acknowledging of his Mercy, be ever with humble Self-abasing Thankfulness, and be careful that you do not make his Mercies to be the Fuel of your Pride, which were to lose all at once.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Be not Prodigal of your Liberty upon a conceit that the Prisons will be easie, nor fearful of adventuring your selves in the way of your Duty. Alas! I am afraid of both
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:65560:44"/>
these extreams on the one hand, lest some among us, having found a great deal of Mercy here, will now think there is no need of any Christian prudence, which is alwayes necessary, and is a great duty. It is not cowardice to make use of the best means to preserve our Liberty, not decling our Duty. On the other-side, there is fear lest some may be fearful, and ready to decline their Duty; because they have newly tasted of a Prison for it. Far be it from you to distrust GOD, of whom you have had so great experience, but be sure you hold on in your duty, whatsoever it cost you.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Do not load others with censures, whose Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or Practice, differs from yours, but humbly bless GOD that hath so happily directed you. You know all are not of the same mind as to the Circumstances of Suffering, and all have not gone the same way. Far be it from any of you (my Brethren) that you should so far forget your selves, as to be unmerciful to your Brethren, but bless GOD that hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected you into a better way. Your charity must grow higher than ever; GOD forbid that you should increase in Censures, instead of increasing in Charity.</p>
                           <p>Having spoken to my Fellow-Prisoners, I have two Words to speak to you our Friends and Brethren with us.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>First,</hi> Let our experience be your incouragement. O love the Lord, ye our Friends, love the Lord, fear him for ever, believe in him, trust in him for ever, for our sakes; we have tasted of the kindness of GOD.</p>
                           <p>You know how good GOD hath been to us in Spirituals &amp; in Temporals. Encourage your hearts in the Lord your God, serve him the more freely and gladly for our sakes. You see we have tryed, we have tasted how good the Lord is: Do you trust him the more, because we have tryed him so much, and found him a Friend so Faithful, so Gracious, that we are uttterly unable to speak his Praise. Go on and fear not in the way of your Duty: <hi>Verily there is a reward for the Righteous.</hi> GOD hath given us a great reward already, but this is but the least, we look for a Kingdom.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Secondly,</hi> and lastly, My desire is to our Friends, that they will all help us in our Praises. Our Tongues are too little to speak forth the Goodness and the Grace of GOD, do you help us in our Praises. Love the Lord the better, Praise him the

                           <p>HE was prevented of going to the Waters, by his last Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment; for want of which, his Distempers increased much upon him all the Winter after, and the next Spring more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                           <p>But going up to the Waters in <hi>July</hi> 1667, they had a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary effect upon him, from what they had at first: For after three dayes taking them, he fell into a Feaver, which seised on his Spirits, and decayed his strength exceedingly, so that he seemed very near Death: But the Lord then again revoked the Sentence passed upon him, and enabled him in six Weeks to return again to his People, where he much desired to be: But finding, at his return, great decay of his strength, and a weakness in all his Limbs, he was willing to go to <hi>Dorchester,</hi> to advise further with Doctor <hi>Lose,</hi> a very Worthy and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Physitian, from whom he had received many Medicines, but never conversed with him, nor had seen him, which he conceived might conduce more to his full Cure.</p>
                           <p>The Doctor soon perceiving my Husbands weakness, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded him to continue for a fortnight or three weeks there, that he might the better advise him, and alter his Remedies, as he should see occasion; which motion was readily yeelded un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by us.</p>
                           <p>But we had not been there above five dayes, before the use of all his Limbs was taken away on a sudden; one day his Arms wholly failing, the next his Legs; so that he could not go, nor stand, nor move a Finger, nor turn in his Bed, but as my self and another did turn him night and day in a Sheet: All means failing, he was given over by Physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and and Friends, that saw him lie some weeks in cold Sweats night and day, and many times for some hours toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, half his Body cold, in our apprehensions, dying; recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving nothing but the best Cordials that Art could invent, and Almond Milk, or a little thin Broth once in three or four days. Thus he lay from <hi>September</hi> 28, to <hi>November</hi> 16. before he
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:65560:45"/>
began to Revive, or it could be discerned that Remedies did at all prevail against his Diseases: In all this time he was still chearful, and when he did speak, it was not at all complaining, but alwayes praising and admiring God for his Mercies; but his Spirits were so low, that he spake seldom, and very soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. He still told us he had no pain at all, and when his Friends admired his Patience, he would say; God had not yet tryed him in any thing, but laying him aside out of his Work, and keeping him out of Heaven; but through Grace he could submit to his pleasure, waiting for him: It was <hi>Pain</hi> he ever feared, and that he had not yet felt; so tender was his Father of him; and he wanted strength (as he often told us) to speak more of his Love, and to speak for God who had been, and was still so gracious to him. Being often askt by my self and others, how it was with his Spirit in all this weakness? he would answer: He had not those <hi>ravishing joys</hi> that he expected, and that some Believers did partake of; but he had a sweet serenity of Heart, and confidence in God, grounded on the Promises of the Gospel, and did believe it would be well with him to all eternity.</p>
                           <p>In all this time, I never heard one impatient word from him, nor could upon my strictest observation, discern the least dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content with this state; though he was a pitiful Object to all others that beheld him, being so consumed, besides the loss of the use of his Limbs: Yet the Lord did support and quiet his Spirit, that he lay as if he had <hi>endured</hi> nothing; breaking out often most affectionately in commending the kindness of the Lord to him, saying, Goodness and Mercy had followed him all his dayes.</p>
                           <p>And indeed the loving kindness and care of God was sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular to us in that place, which I cannot but mention to his praise.</p>
                           <p>We came Strangers thither, and being in our Inn, we found it very uncomfortable; yet were fearful to impose our selves on any private House: But necessity inforcing, we did enquire for a Chamber, but could not procure one; the Small Pox being very hot in most Families, and those that had them not, daily expecting them, and so could not spare Rooms, as else they might. But the Lord who saw our affliction, inclined the heart of a very good Woman, (a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters

Widdow) one Mrs. <hi>Bartlet,</hi> to come and invite us to a Lodging in her House; which we readily and thankfully accepted off; where we were so accommodated, as we could not have been any where else in the Town, especially in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the assistance I had from four young Women who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved under the same roof, and so were ready, night and day, to help <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                                 <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                              </gap>, (I having no Servant nor Friend near me) we being so unsetled, I kept none, but had alwayes tended him my self to that time: And the Ministers and Christians of that place were very compassionate towards us, visiting and Praying with and for us often: And Dr. <hi>Lose</hi> visited him twice a day for twelve or fourteen Weeks, except when he was called out of Town, refusing any Fees tendered to him: The Gentry in and about the Town, and others, sending to us what-ever they imagined might be pleasing to him; fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing him with all delicates that might be grateful to one so weak; So that he wanted neither Food nor Physick, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not only for necessity, but for delight, and he did much delight himself in the consideration of the Lord's kindness to him in the love he received, and would often say, <hi>I was a Stranger, and Mercy took me in; in Prison, and it came to me; sick and weak, and it visited me.</hi> There was also ten young Women, besides the four in the House, that took their turns to watch with him constantly; for twelve weeks space I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver wanted one to help me: And the Lord was pleased to shew his power so in strengthening me, that I was every night (all these Weeks in the depth of Winter) one that helped to turn him, never lying out of the Bed one night from him, but every time he called or wanted any thing, was waking to assist her in the Chamber, though as some of them have said they did tell, that we did turn him more than 40 times a Night, he seldom sleeping at all in the Night, in all those Weeks: Though his tender Affections were such, as to have had me sometimes lain in another Room, yet mine were such to him, that I could not bear it, the thoughts of it being worse to me than the trouble or disturbance he accounted I had with him, for I feared none would do any thing about him with such ease; neither would he suffer any one all the day to touch him but me, or to give him any thing that he did receive; by which I discerned it was most grateful to him,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:65560:46"/>
and therefore so to me; And I never found any want of my Rest, nor did get so much as a Cold all that Winter, though I do not remember that for 14 or 15 years before, I could ever say I was one month free of a most violent Cough, which if I had been molested with then, would have been a great additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his and my affliction; and he was not a little taken with the goodness of God to me in the time of all his sickness, but especially that Winter; for he being not able to help himself in the least, I could not be from him night nor day, with any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to him or my self.</p>
                           <p>In this condition he kept his Bed till <hi>December</hi> the 18th. And then, beyond all expectation, though in the depth of Winter, began to revive and go out of his Bed; but he could neither stand nor go, nor yet move a finger, having sense in all his Limbs, but not the least motion: As his strength did increase, he learnt to go, (as he would say) first by being led by two of us, then by one; and when he could go one turn in his Chamber, though more weakly, and with more fear than the weakest Child that ever I saw, he was won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully taken with the Lord's Mercy to him: By <hi>February</hi> he was able, with a little help, to walk in the Streets; (but not to feed himself) nor to go up or down stairs without much help.</p>
                           <p>When he was deprived of the use of his Limbs, looking down on his Arms, as I held him up by all the strength I had: He again listed up his Eyes from his useless Arms to. Heaven, and with a chearful countenance said: <hi>The Lord hath given, and the Lord hath taken, and blessed be the Name of the Lord.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Being asked by a Friend, How he could be so well contented to lie so long under such weakness? He answered,</p>
                           <p>What, is God my Father, Jesus Christ my Saviour, and the Spirit my sweet Friend, my Comforter, and Sanctifyer, and Heaven my Inheritance? Shall I not be content without Limbs and Health? Through Grace I am fully satisfied with my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers pleasure.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>To another that asked him the same, he Answers,</hi> I have chosen God, and he is become mine, and I know with whom I have trusted my self, which is enough: He is an unreasonable wretch that cannot be content with a God, though he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

else: My interest in God is all my joy.</p>
                           <p>His Friends (some of <hi>Taunton</hi>) coming to <hi>Dorcester</hi> to see him, he was much revived, and would be set up in his Bed, and have all the Curtains drawn, and desired them to stand round about the Bed, and would have me take out his Hand, and hold it out to them, that they might shake him, though he could not them; as he used formerly to do, when he had been absent from them: And as he was able, thus he spake to them: <hi>O how it rejoyces my heart to see your Faces, and to hear your Voices, though I cannot speak as heretofore to you: Methinks I am now like Old</hi> Jacob, <hi>with all his Sons about him: Now you see my weak estate; thus have I been for many weeks, since I parted with</hi> Taunton, <hi>but God hath been with me, and I hope with you; your Prayers have been heard, and answered, for me many wayes; the Lord return them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your own Bosoms. My Friends, Life is mine, Death is mine, in that Covenant I was preaching of to you, is all my Salvation, and all my desire; although my Body do not prosper, I hope through Grace my Soul doth.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>I have lived a sweet Life by the Promises, and I hope through Grace can Die by a Promise: It is the Promises of God which are everlasting, that will stand by us: Nothing but God in them will stead us in a day of Affliction.</p>
                           <p>My dear Friends, I feel the power of those Doctrines I Preached to you, on my Heart: Now the Doctrines of Faith, of Repentance, of Self-denyal, of the Covenant of Grace, of Contentment, and the rest; O that you would live them over, now I cannot Preach to you.</p>
                           <p>It is a shame for a Believer to be cast down under Afflictions, that hath so many glorious Priviledges, Justification, Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Sanctification, and eternal Glory. We shall be as the Angels of God in a little while: Nay, to say the truth, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are, as it were, little Angels already, that live in the power of Faith. O my Friends! Live like Believers, trample this dirty World under your feet; Be not taken with its Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, nor disquieted with its Crosses, You will be gone out of it shortly.</p>
                           <p>When they came to take their leaves of him, he would Pray with them as his weak state would suffer him; and in the words of <hi>Moses,</hi> and of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> Blessed them.

                              <hi>The same he alwayes used after a Sacrament:</hi> The Lord bless you and keep you, the Lord cause his Face to shine upon you, and give you peace. And the God of Peace, that brought again from the Dead our Lord Jesus, through the Blood of the Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Covenant, make you perfect in every good Work to do his Will, working in you that which is well-pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory, for ever and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                              <hi>And then spake thus,</hi> [Farewell, farewell my dear Friends] Remember me to all <hi>Taunton;</hi> I beseech you and them, if I never see your faces more, go Home and live over what I have preached to you, and the Lord provide for you when I am gone: O! let not all my labours and sufferings, let not my wasted strength, my useless Limbs, rise up in judgment against you at the great Day of the LORD.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Another time, some coming to Visit him there, he spake thus to them:</hi> O! my Friends, let your whole Conversation be as becomes the Gospel of Christ; whether I am present or absent, live to what I have spoken to you in the Name of the Lord: Now I cannot Preach to you, let my wasted strength, my useless Limbs, be a Sermon to you: Behold me, I cannot move a finger; all this is come upon me for your sakes, and the Gospel; It is for Christ and you that I have thus spent out my self: I am afraid of you, lest some of you, after all that I have spoken to you, should be lost in the World. There are many Professors who can pray well, and talk well, whom we shall find at the left Hand of Christ another day: You have your Trades, your Estates, your Relations; be not taken with these, but with God: O live on him! For the Lord's sake go Home and take heed of the World, worldly Cares, worldly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, worldly Friends, <hi>&amp;c. Saying thus,</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>The Lord having given Authority to his Ministers to bless his People, accordingly I bless you in his Name,</hi> using the same words as before, and so parted with them; with many other dear Expressions of his Love to them and the Town.</p>
                           <p>And thus he was used to Converse with all that came to Visit him, as he was able, looking alwayes chearfully upon them, and never complaining of any Affliction he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, except it were to excite his <hi>Taunton</hi> Friends to their Duties.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="85" facs="tcp:65560:47"/>In <hi>February,</hi> he being very desirous to return among his People, he moved it to his Doctor, who consented to it, fearing that Air might be too keen for him in <hi>March:</hi> And hoping that it might much add to his Cure, to satisfie his mind.</p>
                           <p>In a Horse-Litter I removed him: He was much pleased at the sight of the Place, and his People, who came flocking about him; and he seemed to increase in strength, so that he was able to feed himself the Week after he came Home: But I fearing the frequent Visits of his Friends might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to him, perswaded him to remove to Mr. <hi>Mallacks</hi> House, which he was again invited to, and most courteously entertained.</p>
                           <p>And thus he continued increasing in strength, till the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>April,</hi> and then he began to decline again, and was taken after some dayes with Convulsion Fits, as he sat in his Chamber one Afternoon, and had three or four more fits that Night: But in the use of Means, through God's Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, he had no more in three Weeks. One Evening being in his Chamber, he desired me to leave him a while alone; which I was very unwilling to do, but his importunity made me to go down from him: But in less than half a quarter of an hour, he was fallen to the Ground in one of his former Fits, and had hurt his Face; and from his Nose came much Blood, which was very clotted and corrupt, which Physitians see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, did conclude (though it were grievous to me, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der such Weakness, he should have so sad an Accident) that the fall saved his life: For had not that Blood come from his Head, he had, so far as they could rationally judge, died in that Fit, which took away his Senses for the present; but he went to Bed, and slept so well that night, as he had not in many Weeks before; so that my Self, and Friends, feared that he had been in an <hi>Apoplexy:</hi> But he awaked about six in the Morning, much refreshed, and full of the Praises of God for his Mercies to him, being very sensible how sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he was surprised the Evening before. After this, he lived alwayes expecting Death, saying often to me and his Friends, <hi>It is but a puff, and I am gone;</hi> And therefore would, every Night after he had been at Prayer, bid all the Family farewel, telling them, <hi>He might be dead before the Morning;</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

some holy Counsels to them, would depart to his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: All the while I was undressing him, he would be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing of Spiritual things, it being all his delight; and when we lay down to rest, his last words were usually, [<hi>We shall shortly be in another Bed, therefore it is good to mind it, and provide for it apace; farewel my Dear Heart, the Lord bless thee</hi>] and so he would go to his Rest. In his Health and Sickness, his first Speeches in the Mornings would be, [<hi>Now we have one day more; here is one more for God; now let us live well this day; work hard for our Souls; lay up much Treasure in Heaven this day, for we have but a few to live.</hi>]</p>
                           <p>After this, the strength of his Limbs, which were decayed, returned again, and he was, beyond all expectation, so far recovered, that we had no fears of his relapsing again: His Appetite, and Rest, and all repaired. But about the sixth of <hi>May,</hi> he began again to find weakness in his Stomach, which in a few dayes so grew upon him, that he lost his Limbs again; and on the 12th of <hi>May,</hi> in the Morning, having lain some dayes and nights in cold Sweats, as heretofore at <hi>Dorchester,</hi> he was again seised with Convulsions, first lying four hours with his eyes fixed to Heaven, not speaking one Word, not in the least moving himself, my self and Friends weeping by him, at last he spake to us with a very audible Voice, [<hi>Weep not for me, my Work is done</hi>] and seemed to be full of Matter to utter to us, but was immediately seised with a tertible Convulsion, which was sad to behold; it so altered his Countenance, and put him into such Sweats, that 'twas strange to see how the drops lay and run down his Face, and Hands, and Body: This held him two hours or more, and ceased, but he was left by it without any sense; and in a quarter of an hour, or little more, fell into another, in which he ratled, and was cold, so that we apprehended every breath would be his last. The Physitian who was then by him, accounted his Pulse to be gone, and that he would be dead in a few minutes: But the Lord shewed his Power here once again in raising him, so that many that came and saw him, that heard the next day he was alive, would not believe till they came and saw him again. These violent Fits went off about twelve a Clock, and he revived, but had no sense to converse with us
<pb facs="tcp:65560:48"/>
till the next day, nor did he perfectly recover them four dayes after, and then was as before, and so continued very weak till <hi>July,</hi> no strength coming into his Hands or Legs; for the most part confined to his Bed, but still chearful in his Spirit, and free to discourse with any that came to visit him, as long as he was able.</p>
                           <p>But the Lord had yet more work for him to do: I seeing him lie so hopeless, as to his Life or Limbs, and considering the Winter was growing on apace, I proposed it to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors to have him to the <hi>Bath;</hi> some were for it, others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it; acquainting my Husband with it, he was much pleased with it, and so earnest in it, that I sent immediately to <hi>Bath</hi> for a Horse-Litter, and the Lord was pleased strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to appear in strengthening him for his Journey; so that he that had not in many weeks been out of his Bed and Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, was able in two dayes to reach near forty miles, (but when he came to <hi>Bath,</hi> the Doctors there seemed to be much amazed to behold such an Object, professing they never saw the like) much wondering how he was come alive such a Journey, and doubted much to put him in: But he having tryed all Artificial Baths, and Oyntments, and Plaisters before, he resolved, against their Judgment, to adventure himself.</p>
                           <p>At his first appearing in the <hi>Bath,</hi> being wasted to Skin and Bone, some of the Ladies were afrighted, as if Death had been come in among them, and could not endure to look towards him.</p>
                           <p>The first time he went in, he was able to stay but a little while, but was much refreshed, and had no symptom of his Fits, which he feared the <hi>Bath</hi> might have caused again: Through the blessing of the Lord upon this means, without any thing else, except his drinking of Goats-Milk, he that was not able to go nor stand, nor move a Finger, could in three weeks time walk about his Chamber, and feed himself: his impaired Appetite was again restored, and his strength so increased, that there seemed no doubt to the Physitians of his full recovery, he having not the least sign of any inclination to his Fits, from the twelfth of <hi>May</hi> till his Death drew nigh.</p>
                           <p>In this time of his being in <hi>Bath,</hi> his Soul was far more
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:65560:49"/>
strengthened with Grace; so that my self, and all that beheld him, and conversed with him, discerned sensibly his growth; and he was in the nights and dayes, so frequently with God, and often in such ravishments of Spirit, from the Joys and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solations that he received from the Spirit of God, that it was oftentimes more than he could express, or his bodily strength could bear; so that for my own part, I had less hopes of his continuance on Earth than ever before: For I perceived plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Lord had spared him but to recover strength of Grace, and to make him a more evident instance of his singular Love, before he took him hence.</p>
                           <p>He being now more chearful than formerly, and more exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly affectionate in his carriage to me, and to all his Friends, especially with those that were most Heavenly, the Lord was pleased to order it in his Providence; there were many such then who came to use the Bath, as Mr. <hi>Fairclough</hi> and his Wife, Mr. <hi>How</hi> of <hi>Torrington,</hi> Mr. <hi>Joseph Barnard</hi> and his Wife, and several of our <hi>Taunton</hi> Friends, and of <hi>Bristol</hi> Ministers and others, which was a great comfort to us.</p>
                           <p>His parts seemed to be more quick in his Converses, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he was put upon, either by Scholars, or those that were more Inferiour. He had many visitors there, both of strangers and Friends, who were willing to see him, and discourse with him, having heard what a monument of Mercy he was; and he would to all of them, so amplifie upon all the Passages of Gods dealings with him, as was very pleasant to all that heard him; and did affect many that were strangers to God, and to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as well as to him.</p>
                           <p>He found much favour, even among the worst, both Gentry and others (such as would make a scoff at Religion, or holy Discourse from others) would hearken to him. Though he did often faithfully reprove many for their Oaths, and excess in Drinking, their lascivious Carriages, which he observed in the <hi>Bath;</hi> and there was none of them but did most thankfully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it from him, and shewed him more respect after, than they had done before: In which he observed much of Gods goodness to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                           <p>While he was in this place, though he had many Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, by his using the <hi>Bath</hi> constantly every day, and his fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Visits, besides his Weakness, yet he kept his constant Seasons, four times a day, for his Holy Retirements; wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the Morning constantly at or before five a Clock, and would not be disturbed till about seven, when he was carried to the <hi>Bath.</hi> Having the Curtains drawn close, he spent his time in Holy Meditation, and Prayer, and Singing, and once again before Dinner, but then he spent less time; and about half an hour before two in the Afternoon, just before he went abroad.</p>
                           <p>For though he never attained to so much strength, as to be able to walk abroad in the Streets without my leading him, or some other, yet he would be imployed for his Lord and Master. His Chair-men that used to carry him to the <hi>Bath,</hi> he appointed to fetch him about three a Clock, who carried him to Visit all the Schools and Alms-houses, and the Godly Poor, especially the Widdows; to whom he would give Money, and with whom he would Pray and Converse with them, concerning their Spiritual States, according as their Necessities required; ingaging those that were Teachers, and Governours, to Teach the <hi>Assemblies Catechism,</hi> buying many Dozens, and giving them to distribute to their Scholars; and many other small Books which he thought might be useful for them; and then would come and see, in a Week or Fortnight, what progress they had made: He also ingaged several to send their Children once a Week to him to be Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techised; which they did hearken to him in: And we had about sixty or seventy Children every Lord's-Day to our Lodging, and they profited much by his Instructions, till some took

such offence at it, that he was forced to desist, and the School-Master was threatned to be cited to <hi>Wells</hi> before the Bishop, and many others afrighted from it.</p>
                           <p>He also sent for all the godly Poor he could find in that place, and entertained them at his Chamber, and gave to them every one as he was able, as a Thank-Offering to the Lord for his Mercy to him, and desired them, with several others, to keep a day of Thanksgiving for him; Mr. <hi>Fairclough,</hi> Mr. <hi>How,</hi> and <hi>Himself,</hi> performing the duties of the day.</p>
                           <p>Thus though his Sickness had been long, and his Expences great, he thought he could never spend enough for him from whom he had received all: He constantly gave Money or Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to all the Children that came to be catechized by him, to ingage them, besides all he gave to the Teachers, and Poor, which indeed was beyond his ability, considering his Estate: But I am perswaded, he did foresee that his time would be but short; and having made a competent and comfortable provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for me, he resolved to lay up the rest in Heaven; he did of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten say to me, <hi>If he lived never so long, he would never increase his Estate, now I was provided for; he having no Children, God's Children should have it.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But he was yet again designing what he might do before he took his leave of the World: And his next work was, to send Letters to all his Relations and intimate Friends, in most of which he urges them to observe his Counsels, for they were like to be his last to them. I alwayes wrote for him, for he could not, by reason of his weakness, write a Line.</p>
                           <p>At this time he had a great desire to go to Mr. <hi>Joseph Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nards,</hi> which was about five Miles from <hi>Bath,</hi> there to finish his last Work for God, that ever he did on Earth; which was to promote the Exercise of Catechising in <hi>Somersetshire</hi> and <hi>Wiltshire:</hi> Mr. <hi>Barnard</hi> having had a great deliverance as well as himself, he proposed this to him as their Thank-Offering to God, which they would joyntly tender to him.

After we had dined, he was in more then ordinary manner transported with Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction towards me; which he expressed, by his returning me thanks for all my pains and care for him and with him, and putting up many most affectionate requests for me to GOD, before he would suffer me to rise as we sat together: At Night again, at Supper, before I could rise from him, he spake thus to me.</p>

                           <p>Ah my Love, I was thinking of my Marriage Day, it will be shortly: O what a joyful day will that be! Will it not, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est thou my dear Heart?</p>
                           <p>Another time, bringing him some Broth, he said, <hi>Blessed be the Lord for these refreshments in the way home; but O how sweet will Heaven be!</hi>

                           <p>When he looked on his weak consumed Hands, he would say, <hi>These shall be changed; This vile Body shall be made like to Christs Glorious Body.</hi>

                           <p>O what a glorious Day will the Day of the Resurrection be! Methinks I see it by Faith; How will the Saints lift up their heads and rejoyce, and how sadly will the wicked World look then!</p>

                           </p>
                           <p>He was exceedingly affected with the three last Chapters of <hi>Saint John's Gospel,</hi> especially Christ's parting Words, and Prayer for his Disciples. But it is time for me to set a stop to my Pen, God did pour into him, and he did pour out so much, that it was scarce possible to retain the Converses of one day, without a constant Register: His Heart, his Lips, his Life was filled up with Grace; In which he did thine both in Health and Sickness, Prosperity and Adversity, in Prison and at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, in his own House, and in the Churches of Christ, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he came: I never heard any that conversed with him, but would acknowledge it was to their advantage.</p>

The 4th of <hi>October</hi> 1655. after a year and two Months acquaintance, our Marriage was consummated.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="95" facs="tcp:65560:52"/>And we lived together with Mr. <hi>Newton,</hi> near two years, where we were most courteously entertained, and then hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be more useful in our Station, we took a House, and I having been alwayes bred to work, undertook to teach a School, and had many Tablers, and Scholars, our Family be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing seldome less than Twenty, and many times Thirty; My School usually fifty or sixty of the Town and other places. And the Lord was pleased to bless us exceedingly in our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours: So that many were converted in a few years, that were before Strangers to God: All our Scholars called him Father: And indeed he had far more care of them than most of their natural Parents, and was most tenderly affectionate to them, but especially to their Souls.</p>
                           <p>His course in his Family was Prayer, and reading the Scriptures, and singing twice a day, except when he cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chised, which was constantly once, if not twice a Week: Of every Chapter that was read, he expected an account of, and of every Sermon, either to himself or me: He dealt with them and his Servants frequently together, and apart, about their Spiritual states, pressing them to all their Duties, both of First and Second-Table, and calling them strictly to account, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they did not omit them. He also gave them Books sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to their Capacities and Condition, which they gave a weekly account of to him or me; but too often by publick Work was he diverted, as I am apt to think, who knew not so well what was to be preferred.</p>
                           <p>His Lords-Days Work was great, for though he Preacht but once in his own Place, yet he was either desired by some of his Brethren to supply theirs on any Exigency, or would go where was no Minister; and so was forced often to leave his Family to me, to my great grief and loss: In his Repetitions in Publick, as well as Catechising, his own Family came all in their turns, to Answer in the Congregation, both Scholars and Servants.</p>
                           <p>When I have pleaded with him for more of his time with my Self and Family, he would answer me: His Ministerial Work would not permit him to be so constant as he would; for if he had Ten Bodies and Souls, he could imploy them all, in, and about <hi>Taunton:</hi> And would say, <hi>Ah my Dear, I know thy Soul is safe; But how many that are Perishing</hi>

                           </p>
                           <p>He was a Holy, Heavenly, Tenderly-Affectionate Husband, and I know nothing I could complain of, but that he was so taken up, that I could have but very little converse with him.</p>
                           <p>His love was expressed to me, in his great care for me, Sick and Well; in his Provision for me; in his Delight in my Company; saying often, He could not bear to be from me, but when he was with God, or imployed for him; and that often it was hard for him to deny himself to be so long absent: It was irksome to him to make a Meal with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out me, nor would he manage any Affair almost without conversing with me, concealing nothing from me, that was fit for me to know; being far from the Temper of those Husbands, who hide all their Concerns from their Wives, which he could not indure to hear of, especially in Good Men.</p>
                           <p>He was a faithful reprover of any thing he saw amiss in me, which I took as a great evidence of his real good will to my Soul; and if in any thing he gave me offence, which was but seldom, so far would he deny himself, as to acknowledge it, and desire me to pass it by, professing to me he could never rest till he had done so; and the like I was ready to do to him, as there was far more reason; by which course, if any difference did arise, it was soon over with us.</p>
                           <p>He was a very tender Master to his Servants, every way ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing it to their Souls and Bodies, giving them that incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement in their places they could desire; expecting from his whole Family that respect, and obedience to his Commands, which their Rule required; reproving them that were careless and negligent in observing them.</p>
                           <p>He was frequent in keeping solemn dayes of Humiliation, especially against a Sacrament.</p>
                           <p>He was a very strict observer of the Sabbath, the Duties of which, he did perform with such joy and alacrity of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as was most pleasant to joyn with him, both in Publick, and in the Family, when we could enjoy him: And this he did much press upon Christians, to spend their Sabbaths more in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                           <p>All the time of his Health, he did rise constantly at, or

before four of the Clock, (and on the Sabbaths sooner, if he did wake) he would be much troubled if he heard any Smiths or Shoomakers, or such Tradesmen at work at their Trades, before he was in his Duties with God: Saying to me often, O how this Noise shames me! Doth not my Master deserve more than theirs? From four till eight, he spent in Prayer, Holy Contemplation, and singing of Psalms, which he much delighted in, and did daily practise alone, as well as in his Family: Having refreshed himself about half an hour, he would call to Family-Duties, and after that to his Studies, till eleven or twelve a Clock, cutting out his Work for every hour in the day. Having refreshed himself a while after Dinner, he used to retire to his Study to Prayer, and so A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad among the Families he was to visit, to whom he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes sent the day before; going out about two a Clock, and seldom returning till seven in the Evening, sometimes later: He would often say, <hi>Give me a Christian that counts his time more precious than Gold.</hi> His Work in his publick Ministry in <hi>Taunton,</hi> being to Preach but once a Sabbath, and Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chise; he devoted himself much to private Work, and also Catechised once a Week in Publick besides, and repeated the Sermon he Preached on the Sabbath-Day, on Tuesday in the Evening.</p>
                           <p>He found much difficulty in going from House to House, because it had not been practised a long time by any Minister in <hi>Taunton,</hi> not by any others of his Brethren; and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but a Young Man, to be looked upon as singular, was that which called for much Self-denyal, which the Lord ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him to Exercise: For after he had Preached up in Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick the Ministers Duty to their People, and theirs to receive them, when they came to them for their Spiritual Advantage, he set speedily upon the Work.</p>
                           <p>In this Work, his course was, to draw a Catalogue of the Names of the Families in each Street, and so to send a day or two before he intended to visit them, that they might not be absent, and that he might understand who was willing to receive him: Those that sent slight Excuses, or did obstinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refuse his Message, he would notwithstanding go to them, and if (as some would) they did shut their Doors against him, he would speak some few affectionate words to them;
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:65560:54"/>
or if he saw cause, denounce the Threatnings of God against them that despise his Ministers, and so departed; and after would send affectionate Letters to them, so full of love, and expressions of his great desires to do their Souls good, as did overcome their Hearts; and they did many of them afterwards readily receive him into their Houses. Herein was his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion shewed to all Sorts, both Poor and Rich, not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining to go into such Houses amongst the Poor, as were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten very offensive to him to sit in, he being of an exact and curious temper: yet would he with joy and freedom, deny himself for the good of their Souls, and that he might fulfil his Ministry among those the Lord had given him the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight of.</p>
                           <p>I perceiving this Work, with what he did otherwise, to be too hard for him, fearing often he would bring himself to Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers and Diseases, as he did soon after, besought him not to go so frequently: His answer would be, <hi>What have I strength for, but to spend for God? What is a Candle for, but to be burnt?</hi> And he would say, <hi>I was like</hi> Peter, <hi>still crying,</hi> O spare thy self; <hi>But I must not hearken to thee, no more than my Master did to him:</hi> Though his Labours were so abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, I never knew him, for nine years together, under the least Distemper one quarter of an hour.</p>
                           <p>He was exceeding temperate in his Dyet, though he had a very sharp Appetite, yet did he at every Meal deny himself, being perswaded that it did much conduce to his Health: His converse at his Table was very profitable, and yet plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant, never rising, either at home or abroad, without drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping something of God, according to the Rule he laid down to others. He was very much in commending and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Mercies of God in every Meal, and was still so plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with his provision for him, that he would often say; He fared deliciously every day, and lived far better than the Great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                           </p>
                           <p>He was much in minding the Poor, that were in want of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:65560:54"/>
all things, often wondering that God should make such a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between him and them, both for this World and that to come; and his Charity was ever beyond his Estate, as my self and many other Friends did conceive, but he would not be disswaded, alwayes saying, <hi>If he were Prodigal, it was for God, and not for himself, nor sin.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>There were but few, if any, Poor Families, especially of the godly in <hi>Taunton,</hi> but he knew their necessities, and did by himself or Friends relieve them: So that our Homes were seldom free of such as came to make complaints to him. After the times grew dead for Trade, many of our godly men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caying, he would give much beyond his ability to recover them: He would buy Pease and Flitches of Bacon, and distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute twice a year, in the cold and hard Seasons. He kept several Children at School at his own Cost; bought many Books and Catechisms, and had many thousands of Prayers printed, and distributed among them! And after his Brethren were turned out, he gave four pounds a year himself to a publick Stock for them, by which he excited many others to do the same, and much more, which else would never have done it: And on any other occasions as did frequently fall in, he would give even to the offence of his Friends: So that many would grudge in the Town to give him what they had agreed for; because he would give so much. Besides all this, the necessities of his own Father, and many other Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were still calling upon him, and he was open handed to them all: So that it hath been sometimes even incredible to our selves to consider how much he did, out of a little Estate, and therefore may seem strange to others: Moreover, when he had received any more than ordinary Mercy at the Hand of GOD, his manner was, to set apart some considerable Portion out of his Estate, and dedicate it to the Lord, as a <hi>Thank-offering,</hi> to be laid out for his <hi>Glory</hi> in pious and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Uses.</p>
                           <p>When I have begged him to consider himself and me; he would answer me, He was laying up, and GOD would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay him: That by liberal things he should stand, when others might fall that censured him; that if he sowed sparingly, he should reap so; if bountifully, he should reap bountifully.</p>
                           <p>And I must confess I did often see so much of GOD in his
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:65560:55"/>
dealings with us, according to his Promises, that I have been convinc'd and silenc'd; God having often so strangely and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly provided for us: And notwithstanding all he had done, he had at last somewhat to dispose of to his Relations, and to his Brethren, besides comfortable provision for me.</p>
                           <p>Thus his whole Life was a continual Sermon, holding forth evidently the Doctrines he Preached; Humility, Self-denyal, Patience, Meekness, Contentation, Faith, and holy Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>In the Week time, he would often ask the Servants for the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:65560:55"/>
Heads of the Sermon, which they had heard on the Lord's-Day before. As he walked about the House, he would make some Spiritual use of what-ever did occur, and still his Lips did drop like the Hony-Comb to all that were about him, to do any Offices for him in his Weakness, were all well requited. To give a few Instances of his savoury words.</p>
                     <p>To one that had done well.
<q>
                           <p>There are two things (<hi>said he</hi>) that we must specially look to after well doing, and the special tast of the Love of God. 1. That we grow not proud of it, and so lose all. 2. That we grow not secure,  and so give the Tempter new Advantages.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Speaking of the Vanity of the World, he said:
<q>
                           <p>It is as good be without the World, and to bear that state as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seemeth a Christian, as to enjoy the World, though it were never so well imployed: If a Man hath Riches, and layeth them out for God, and for his Servants, yet is it as happy a state to receive Alms of another, so we bear our Poverty aright, and are chearful and thankful in our low E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state. (Though yet it is true, that Riches may be used to the good of others; and it is more honourable to give, than  to receive.)</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Another time he was saying:
<q>
                           <p>How necessary a Duty it is for a Child of God, placidly to suit with all God's Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations, and that a Christian must not onely quietly submit to God in all his dealings, but ever to be best pleased with what God doth, as knowing that he is infinitely Wise, and Good. And, O how unbecoming a Christian is it to do  o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise.</p>
                        </q>
To which one answering, How short we ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily fall as to that temper: He replyed,
<q>
                           <p>We have much ground to go yet, but so it must be; but we shall never be well  in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed till we come to Heaven.</p>

                        <pb n="102" facs="tcp:65560:56"/>Another time,
<q>
                           <p>I bless the Lord, I delight in nothing in  this World, further than I see God in it.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Another time (in his weakness) saith he:
<q>
                           <p>There are three things which must be unlearned, as being mistakes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men. 1. Men think that their happiness lyeth in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the World, when it is much more in contemning the World. 2. Men think that the greatest contentment lyeth in having their Wills, when indeed it lyeth in crossing, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying, and subduing their wills to the Will of God. 3. Men think it their business and benefit to seek themselves,  when indeed it is the denying of themselves.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Another time this was his advice.
<q>
                           <p>1. Value precious time, while time doth last, and not when it is irrevocably lost. 2. Know the worth of things to come, before they come, (or are present) and the worth of things present, before they are past. 3. Value no Mercy as it serveth to content the flesh, but as it is serviceable for God, and to  things eternal.</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Such was his talk at the Table, where he would be still raised in gratitude for God's Bounty, and used to eat his meat with much chearfulness and comfort, as savouring of a sweeter good.</p>
                     <p>He took one that was watching with him by the hand, and said:
<q>
                           <p>I hope to pass an Eternity with thee, in the praises of our God: In the mean time, Let us live a life of praise while we are here, for it is sweet to us, and delightful to God: It is harmony in his Ears, our failings being pardoned, and we  and our praise accepted through Christ.</p>
                        </q>
Such discourse is, I hope, no great rarity with good men, in the chearfulness of prosperity in health; but for a man on the Bed of tedious languishing it is more rare.</p>
                     <p>The night before he went to <hi>Bath,</hi> where he died, he said to the same Person:
<q>
                           <p>O how much more hath God done for you, than for all the World of unconverted Persons, in that he hath wrought his Image on your heart, and will bring you at last to his Coelestial Glory: See now that you acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Grace of God, and give him the praise of it: For my part, I bless the Lord, I am full of his Mercy; Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Mercy have followed me all my dayes; I am full and running over: And now I charge you to walk chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:65560:56"/>
and to follow me with your Praises whilst I am  alive.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>And for such in the Family as lay under doubts of their condition, he took great care of them, endeavouring daily to satisfie their Doubts, and answer their Scruples; and still would be enquiring, whether they had yet any more settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And if they said, they knew not how to try them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; he would say, <hi>Come, let me help you;</hi> and so would take them aside, and propound some three or four sound Marks, by way of Question, and would ask them whether it were so with them or not? And if any doubt appeared to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main about it, he would not easily leave them; till they were somewhat satisfied at that time, and would bring all down to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And if yet doubts remained, he would use all the compassion and pitifulness that might be, and open to them the goodness of God's Nature, the sufficiency of Christ, and his readiness to accept returning Sinners; and after long tryal by fairer means, would plainly labour to convince <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>In Family Duties, he seemed more excellent than at other times.</p>
                     <p>He was a man of singular patience in Affliction. Though he lay under such weakness for certain years, as rendered him almost wholly unable for his publick Work, and many times not able to move a Hand or Finger, or hardly any other part; yet some that have been much with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

He was indeed, as it were, all affection in pursuing and promoting the grand interests of Religion. The Zeal of God's House had consumed him, and that not Blind nor Wild, but well attempered with Light and Heats. In Sum, what Holy Mr. <hi>Herbert</hi> said of himself, that may be said of him, That his Active Soul was as a keen Knife in a thin Sheath, ever about to cut through, and take its flight into the Region of Souls.</p>

                        <p>But to proceed to some of his excellent Properties. His gravity appeared to be true and genuine, (as not affected or morose, not through any inability, but unwillingness to press his Wit to the service of Vanity) resulting from a mind ever in the awe of God. Because his Presence and Deportment struck such an awe even on all with whom he conversed, and composed them to a true decorum. So that as Reverend Mr. <hi>Bolton,</hi> when walking in the Streets, was so much cloathed with majesty, as by the notice of his coming in these Words, <hi>Here comes Mr. Bolton,</hi> as it were to charm them into order, when vain or doing amiss; so this most grave Divine, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever he came, was as a walking Ghost by his presence, conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them into a grave deportment, his countenance ever pointing at his awful Soul. What the Image or Statue of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacherib</hi> did speak, that much more did this lively Image of the most High GOD speak, <hi>viz. He who looketh to me, let him be Religious.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This his great gravity was not onely Universally discerned by all, but also more particularly and especially acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and loved by his Brethren in the Ministry, for there being some matter of moment depending among them, the care of which was to be devolved on some one man: A worthy Divine far exceeding him in years, sollicited him to take it on him, who modestly waved it, wondering that they should pitch on one so young and unexperienced as himself, for so solemn an undertaking: To whom the forenamed Divine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed; That of all the Ministers, his Brethven, whereof many for Age were his Fathers, he knew none of greater Gravity,

He became all things to all men, that he might gain the more, and so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municative innocent and obliging were all his Converses, that he commanded the imitation and admiration of his Friends, and forc'd this acknowledgment from his Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, both Prophane, Atheistical, and Sectarian, <hi>viz.</hi> That if there were ever a good Man among them, (meaning the <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformists</hi>) Mr. <hi>Ahein</hi> was he.</p>

Of the good things pertaining to this Life, he was often liberal beyond his measure, and of those pertaining to another Life, often beyond his strength; and by this Constellation of his Charity and Alms-deeds, he made the one more Profitable, and the other more Acceptable; the one the greater, and the other the happier, and more successful; and by this Conjunction also, he approved himself more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect before God, the more throughly furnished to every good Word and Work.</p>

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:65560:60"/>
and Hopes of the <hi>Ethnick</hi> Religions, and by a sober comparing of that with these. He also much delighted in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natomy,</hi> in which he acquired a considerable skill, which also he not a little improved by frequent Dissections. And in his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Ministry, he often made use of this his insight, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing, with <hi>Galen,</hi> Hymns to the Creator, whose infinite Wisdom he was often heard to admire, in the contrivance of Mans outward frame, and in the rare contexture, dependance, and use of all, even the minutest parts, in the excellent Fabrick of Mans body.

To speak evil of no man,</hi> much less of dignities. Insomuch that when his Judgement was at any time desired concerning any Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon which he had heard, and any Minister, (Conformist, or Nonconformist) though weak and mean, he would yet ever find matter of Commendation, none of Dispraise, judging the Minister and his Discourse, at least, to be honest, and of good intent. He abhorred to intrench on the Divine Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, in judging of Mens States before the time; and in condemning Mens Actions at all adventures, without consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering their lessening or altering Circumstances. And as he liked to judge no man beyond his Sphere, and speak evil of no Man; so in his Life did he reap as great and visible Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward as any for this most Christian Practice; for the Tongues even of all did pay tribute to his good Name; which was a thing so entire and sacred, that scarce a <hi>Rabsheka</hi> or <hi>Shimei</hi> could find a passage by which to invade it.

                        <p>He was not onely a man aspiring to the Heights, but also respecting the due breadth and extent of Religion, being well-advised, how much the Vitals and Honour of Religion in the World are conserved by, and concerned in a conscio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable discharge of Second-Table Duties. That he had a deep sense of the great advantage or disadvantage accruing to Religion, by the strict or remiss performance of the Duties of the Second-Table, and particularly those of the Fifth Commandment; all bear him witness in, that he upon seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Texts for a long time together, most faithfully instructed his People in Relative-Duties, (than which, none indeed are more momentous, and less observed) and most sharply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved the Guilty for their failures therein; on all which Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, their Duties, and Defects, he particularly, and with much Zeal insisted. Witness also his great grief and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:65560:61"/>
which he frequently conceived, and with great ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemency expressed in lamenting over, and reproving some Professors of Religion, for their wretched neglect and breach of some Second-Table Precepts; the scandal and disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of which to Religion, and the Reiigious, how he resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, none but God and his own Soul did throughly know. He vehemently detested that impious and hellish design of putting asunder (in this matter) what God hath joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, <hi>viz.</hi> Those Commands respecting God, and our Neighbour; both which he hath equally appointed to us, as Rules of Direction and Judgement. He was neither <hi>Legalist</hi> nor <hi>Solifidian;</hi> neither <hi>Ritualist</hi> nor <hi>Enthusiast,</hi> not so much above in the Mount with God, as not also to come down to his Neighbour, whom he did accost as <hi>Moses,</hi> with both Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles in his Hand, on which his Life and Doctrine did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly and excellently comment.</p>

                           <p>His Prudence; Then in apportioning, as well as designing, the most suitable and seasonable instructions to his People, was most apparent, in that he was still (after he had finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a foregoing Text or Discourse) even at a loss, as he hath often expressed himself to some of his Friends, what Subject most advantagious and seasonable to his Auditory, he should next insist on; so far he was from aiming or shooting at Rovers in his Divine Instructions and Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And so loth he was to labour in vain, and to pass from one Discourse to another, as one unconcerned whether he had sown any good Seeds or no on the Hearts of his Hearers; that in the close of his Applicatory part on any Text, (which sometimes he handled for a considerable
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:65560:62"/>
while) he ever expressed his great unwillingness to leave that Subject, till he could have some assurance, that he had not fought in that Spiritual Warfare against Sin, as one who beateth the Air; when also he expressed his great fear, lest he should, after all his most importunate Warnings, leave them as he found them. And here with how much Holy-Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> did he frequently expostulate the Case with Impenitent Sinners, in words too many to mention, and yet too weighty to be forgotten; vehemently urging them to come to some good resolve before he and they parted, and to make their choice either of Life or Death.</p>

During the time of his publick Ministry on every Lords-day in the Afternoon he constantly catechised, before a great Congregation, the Youth of each Sex by turns, amongst whom were several both young Men and Women, sometimes five or six of the chief Scholars of the Free-School, sometimes five or six of the Apprentices of the Town, some of whom, though of mans estate, who accounted it not a disgrace to learn (according to the guise of this mad

World) but to be ignorant. Sometimes, of the other Sex, five or six young Gentlewomen, who were under his Wifes Tuition, (and so his Domestick over-sight) kept their turns, of whom she had not a few, and those the Daughters of Gentlemen of good rank far and near, whose laudable emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and love to their Father (as they styled him) and to the Work, was the cause why they were not so over-bashful as to decline so advantagious a course; by which, together with domestick Instructions and Example, even all received a tincture of Piety and Religion, and many a through Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression: Besides these several Virgins also, and among these the Daughters of some of the chief Magistrates in the Town did keep their turns. In this his course he drew out on the short Answers in the <hi>Assemblies Catechism,</hi> an excellent Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course on all the Points of the Christian <hi>Theology,</hi> which he handled successfully, reducing his Discourse to several Heads, which he also proved by pertinent Places of Scripture; which done, he gave both the Heads and Proofs written at length, on a Week day, to those whom he designed to Catechize on the ensuing Lords-day, which, besides the short Answers in the <hi>Catechism,</hi> and the annexed Proofs they committed to memory, and rendred on the After-noon of the day afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said. Throughout all which course he approved himself to be a most substantial Divine.</p>
                        <p>Neither did his Catechistical Labours rest here, but also on <hi>Thursdayes</hi> in the Afternoon (as I remember) he Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chised in the Church, Street by Street, whole Families, excepting the Married or more Aged, in order: Which Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise (I suppose) he designed as preparatory to his Lord's-Dayes Work. Besides this, on <hi>Saturdayes</hi> in the Morning, he Catechised the Free-School of that place, instructing them in the Points of Christian Doctrine, and excellently explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Answers in the <hi>Assemblies Catechism,</hi> discovering a Mine of Knowledge in them, and in himself. How excellent was his design, and great his Labour, besides all this, in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from House to House, and instructing both Old &amp; Young, is elsewhere abundantly declared. Neither was this his Labour in vain, but became even as successful as laborious; for there are few but have gratefully acknowledged that by this means they were either led into the Knowledge, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced

to the belief, choice and practice of that which was and is of Soveraign advantage to them to this day.

And yet the consideration of the difficulty was not to him an Argument to forbear, but rather a stronger Motive to undertake it; who ever delighted to converse in, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer the difficulties of Christianity, both in doing and suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Small difficulties here were not his match, and there were no noble Atchievements in Religion, to which he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained not, or vigorously aspired.</p>

In com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance with this his excellent Exhortation unto others, he knew not a day wherein he arose without some Heavenly design of promoting GOD's Glory, and the good of Souls, accounting it a shame that the Covetous should arise with such anxious projects of compassing his desired Wealth, the Ambitious his aiery Honours and Grandeur, the Voluptuous his vain Pleasures; and that the Religious, who have so glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious a Prize and Trophies before their eyes, should be Men of no Projects or Designs. If of any, it may be affirmed of him, that according to his frequent and vehement Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation thereunto, he made Religion his business. Which worthy advice in the same words, he did so often inculcate, that a Gentleman meeting a plain honest Countrey Man, and discoursing of Mr. <hi>Allein,</hi> cavil'd at this passage which he had often heard from him, as appearing unto him absur'd and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligible, not knowing how any thing (as he said) could be called a Man's business, unless that which is secular; so foolishly ignorant of the just Interest and Power of Religion, is an unhallowed heart, and so apt to quarrel with that wholesome advice, and loth to be in earnest in any thing, unless in the pursuit of Vanity or Vice.</p>

                        <p>Neither did onely the frequent and faithful performance of the two great difficulties of Christianity, <hi>viz.</hi> Reproof, and Self-Examination, (consisting of so many complicated Self-denyals) proclaim and improve his great Piety, but also his so great acquaintance with the delightsome Work of Heavenly Meditation. A <hi>Specimen</hi> of his profitable ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagery
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:65560:66"/>
of this Work, and his great Heights herein he often gave in some of his most excellent devotional and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plative Discourses, both dropt from his Mouth, and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Writing. And as was his delight, so were his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses with those Authors who did encrease his contemplative Pleasure; but particularly he delighted in Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form of Meditation on the Heavenly Felicity, in the close of his <hi>Saints Everlasting Rest;</hi> great part whereof he so digested, as often to cite it with great pleasure, prefacing his Citations with these words. <hi>Most divinely saith that Man of GOD, Holy Mr.</hi> Baxter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And indeed had not his zeal for GOD's Glory, and the Salvation of Souls, engaged him so much to an Active Life, he could have even lived and dyed wholly in Divine Contemplation and Adoration; so much did he delight to shrink within himself, and to abandon the view of the desperate Adventures, and Antick Motions of a mad World, that so being shut to these, he might onely open his Soul to GOD and Glory, displaying it to the glorious Beams of the Sun of Righteousness. Therefore did he often delight in his devotions to converse with the Fowls of the Air, and the Beasts of the Field, since these were more innocent, and less degenerate than Man.</p>
                        <p>With Streams and Plants did he delight to walk, and all these did utter to his attentive Ear the Praise and Knowledge of his Creator, and in his unsetled sojournings from place to place he did often (to use his Words) look back with sweetness and great content on the places of his former plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant retirements, setting as it were a Mark upon those which had marvellously pleased him in his Solitudes, by administring to his contemplative delight.</p>

                        <p>In the Close, His great perfection in holiness was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, in that he loved so much, and lived a life of Praise, and Thanksgiving. Being arrived to some perfection, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired and designed to antedate the Work and Songs of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits made perfect. Thus <hi>David</hi> much proclaimed his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in Piety, by his so great heights in this Heavenly Employment. And its Evident that Saints most devoted
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:65560:66"/>
to this Heavenly repast, are most perfect; because the more Men adore and praise, the less they want, (for sad and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Complaints, and pensive Thoughts, are the Attendants of great wants) and the less men want, the more is their perfection. His Exhortations to Christians did frequently design to raise them to that sublime life of Praise and Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving. Often hath he reproved Christians, charging them with the greatest folly and ingratitude in so much neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this so pleasing and profitable duty, and in interessing it so little in their Religious Exercises. He much condemned them for that too general practice in thrusting so enlarging a part of their Devotions into so narrow a Room, as only the close of their Prayers. Especially did he excite Christians to this Duty on the Lord's Day, as the most proper Work for so Divine a Festival. Shaming them with the excellent Example of the Primitive Christians, who welcomed in the Sun that brought so glorious a Day as the Christian Sabbath with their Heavenly Hymnes to their Creator and Redeemer. And reproving them for so little considering and observing the proper end of its Institution. But as he respects his own practice a great, yea, and sometimes the greatest part of his Prayer was Thanks-giving, and indeed he was never so much in his Element either in Prayer, or in Preaching, as when he was extolling and adoring the Love of <hi>Christ,</hi> and marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at GOD's infinite goodness in the Gift of his Son our Saviour.</p>
                        <p>Neither did he so gaze upon and adore Christ his Redeemer and his Redemption, as to forget to sound forth Praises of GOD, the Creator, for often he hath been heard with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration and praise, to take notice of the Divine Power and Wisdom in the Works of Creation, and therefore in the open Air, in the private retirement of some Field or Wood, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted to address himself to God in praise, that his eyes might affect his heart, and awake his glory. And here often he hath been heard to say: <hi>That Man was the Tongue of the whole Creation, appointed as the Creatures Interpreter, to speak forth, and make articulate the Praises which they but silent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently intimate.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>He much delighted in Vocal Musick, and especially in singing <hi>Psalms</hi> and <hi>Hymns,</hi> particularly Mr. <hi>Bartons,</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

                     </head>
                     <p>HE was a Person, with whom for many years I was well acquainted, and the more I knew him, the more I loved and admired the rich and exceeding Grace of GOD in him: I looked on him as one of the most elevated, refined, choice Saints, that ever I knew, or expect (while I live) to know; and
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:65560:67"/>
that because (among others) I observed these things of him.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. A most sincere, pure, and absolute consecration of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to <hi>GOD</hi> in <hi>CHRIST JESUS:</hi> his Soul had first practised the Covenant-Dedication, which his hand afterward prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, as a Patern to others in his Father-in-Laws Book.</p>
                     <p>There seemed no sinister end, or false affection, to move or sway him in his way; But the good pleasure of the <hi>LORD,</hi> the edification of his Church, and the Salvation of Souls, were the only marks his eye seemed (at all) to regard, in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs and Acts: I know no other mans heart; but thus he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to my most attentive observation; and so I fully believe concerning him, as much as of any Person I ever saw.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In this his dedication to God, he was carried with the highest and purest flame of Divine Love that ever I observed in any: And that Love arising from a clear vision of the Beauty of Divine Perfections, especially his Gospel Love; the sight of which Beauty and Excellency seemed perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to possess and ravish his Soul: This Love seemed wholly unmixed from all that carnal heat that would car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry him into Fantastick or Indecent Expressions; but his mind seemed to be alwayes ascending with its might in the greatest calmness and satisfaction. Thus have I oft observed him in frequent and silent elevation of Heart, manifested by the most genuine and private lifting up of his eyes, and joyned with the sweetest smile of his Countenance, when (I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident) he little thought of being seen by any: Thus have I oft heard him flow in Prayer and Discourse, with the clearest conviction, and dearest taste of divine Excellency and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; and the fullest, highest, and most pleased expression of his being overcome by it, and giving up his ALL in esteem to it; but this Love, in the greatest demonstration, appeared by his perpetual greedy and unsatiable spending of his whole self for the Glory of God, good of the Church, and Salvatio of Souls. His Head was ever contriving, his Tongue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, and his whole Man acting some design for these; so he lived, and so he dyed: He laboured and suffered himself into the Maladies which ended him: And when he was at <hi>Bath,</hi> like a perfect Skeleton, and could move neither Hand nor Foot, when his Physitians had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> him all Preaching, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded him from Vocal Praying, (as being above his strength)
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:65560:68"/>
yec then would he almost daily be carried in his <hi>Bath-Chair</hi> to the Alms-Houses, and little Childrens Schools, and there give them Catechisms, teach them the meaning of them, and call them to an account, how they remembred and understood. And he died designing a way how every poor Child in <hi>Somerset<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire</hi> might Have, Learn, and be instructed in the <hi>Assemblies Catechism;</hi> yea and at the expression of his affection, I cannot but mention the frequentest Extasies or Raptures of Spirit, wherein he lay on his Bed (when his Body was even depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of all power of its own motion, but with no great pain) in consideration of Divine Love to him in general, and in particular, that he felt no great pain: Never heard I God so loved, and thanked, in the highest confluences of pleasing providences by others, as he was by him in his affliction, for not inflicting great pain upon him; though he was otherwayes so sad a Spectacle of weakness, and looked so like death, that some great Ladies oft hindered his coming into the <hi>Bath,</hi> the gastliness of his look did so afright them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. His pure and sacred Love wrought in him a great Spirit of Charity and Meekness to Men of other Judgements and Perswasions; and great affection towards all such in whom he found any Spiritual good. His Zeal was all of a building, and no destroying nature; he had too much wisdom to esteem his own thoughts to be the Standard of all other Mens: His clear Light and pure Heat, made him of a more discerning substantial and divine temper, than to reject any (in whom Charity could see any thing of a new nature) for differing from him in the Modes or Forms of <hi>Discipline</hi> or <hi>Worship,</hi> or Disputable <hi>Points.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. Suitably to his high degree of Holiness and Divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, he enjoyed the richest assurance of Divine Love to himself in particular, and his saving interest in Christ. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve few Men were ever born that attained to so clear, satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and powerful evidence, that his sins were pardoned, and his Person accepted in <hi>Jesus,</hi> into eternal Life, and had more glorious fore-tastes of Heaven. I remember once, coming in when he was kneeling down to Family Prayer, his Heart was (in that Duty) carried forth into such expressions of love and praise for the sealings of everlasting Love and Life, as I never heard before or since; and such as (I am fully satisfied) none
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:65560:68"/>
could express, but who had received the White Stone with the new Name in it.</p>
                     <p>But this was not accidental to him, or unusual; for (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Clouds he might possibly have, though I know of none) yet I am sure (for a good time before his death) he lived in the very dawning to Glory, both in the full assurance of it as his Portion, and a Spirit of Sanctity, Love, and Praise, like unto it.</p>
                     <p>And though in the very hour of his dying, his Disease had heat his Head; and in his Raptures, he had Expressions, which at another time his Grace and Reason would not have used; yet, all the Copies, (I have seen of those Transports) in the substance of them, speak only fuller assurance of God's Love to him, and his highest returns of love to Christ again.</p>
                     <p>And I do not at all wonder, that a Person shining so much with the Divine Image, and living so uninterruptedly in the clearest and nearest Divine Communion, should enjoy such assurance of God's everlasting Love, and be filled so with Joy therein, and making such returns of Love and Praise thereto.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> I say this for a Foundation, That a mans Life con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth not in the Abundance of the things that he possesseth. It was accounted a wise Prayer that <hi>

                        </hi> put up of old, that he might only be Fed with Food convenient for him. And certain it is that where men have least of the World; they esteem it least, and live more by Faith and in dependance

upon God, casting their care and burden upon him. O the sweet breathings of <hi>Davids</hi> soul! the strong actings of his Faith and Love, that we find come from him, when his condition was low and mean in the World. How close<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doth he cling? How fully doth he Relie upon God? The Holy Ghost seems to make it a Priviledge to be brought to a necessity of living by Faith, as, I think, I have formerly hintted thee, out of <hi>Deut.</hi> 11. 10. 11. where <hi>Canaan</hi> is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd before <hi>AEgypt,</hi> in regard of its dependance upon God for the former and latter Rain, which in <hi>AEgypt</hi> they could live without, and have supplies from the River. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly could we that are unexperienced, but feel the Thorns of those cares and troubles that there are in gathering and keeping much, and the danger when Riches increase of setting our hearts upon them, we should prize the happiness of a middle condition much before it. Doubtless, Godliness with contentment, is great gain. <hi>Seekest thou great things for thy self</hi> (saith the Prophet to <hi>Baruch</hi>) <hi>seek them not.</hi> Certainly a good Conscience is a continual Feast, and enough for a happy Life: no man that Wareth intangleth himself with the affairs of this Life, that he may please him who hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen him to be a Souldier. We should be but little Incumbred with the things of this World, and withal free from a World of Intanglements, which in a great place committed wholly to our charge, would be upon our Consciences as no small Burden.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> I take this for an undoubted truth, that a dram of Grace, is better than a Talent of Wealth; and therefore such a place where our Consciences would be free, and we had little to do in the World to take off our hearts and thoughts from the things of Eternity, and had the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of abundance of means, and the daily opportunities of warming our hearts with the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Let us think with our selves, what though our Purses, our Estates, may thrive better
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65560:71"/>
in a place of a larger maintenance? yet where are our graces, our souls, like to thrive any way answerable to what they are in this? We should have but little in the World, and we could live hereafter; but alas, what is this if it be made up to us, as it will surely be in Communion with God and his People? If we thrive in Faith, and Love, Humility, and Heavenly mindedness, as above all places I know we are likely to do there, what matter is it though we do not raise our selves in the World? the thing it may well be accounted but mean; but alas, let us look upon it with a spiritual Eye, and then we shall pass another Judgement of it. Oh! who would leave so much Grace, and so much comfort in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Christ and his Saints, as we may gain there, for the probabilities of living with a little more gentility and handsomness in the world? 'Tis a strange thing to see how Christians generally do judge so carnally of things, looking to the things that are seen and Temporal, and not the things that will stick by us to Eternity. What is it worth a year? is the Maintenance certain and sure? What charges are there like to be? these are the questions we commonly ask first, when we speak of setling. But alas, though those things are duly to be considered too, yet what good am I like to do? what good am I like to get? (Both which questions I think might be as comfortably Answered concerning this, as any place in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>) These should be the main Interrogatories, and the chief things we should judge of a place to settle in by. What if we have but a little in the World? Why then we must keep but a short Table, and shall make but a little noise in the World, and must give the meaner entertainments to our Friends. O but will not this be abundantly made up, if we have more outward and inward Peace, as we may well count we shall have. One dram of saving Grace will weigh down all this. Let others <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

The best way to get Riches, is out of doubt to set them lowest in ones desires. <hi>Solomon</hi> found it so: Alas, he did not ask Riches, but Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Ability, to discharge his great Trust; but God was so pleased with his Prayer, that he threw in them into the Bargain. If we seek the Kingdom of God, and his Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the first place, and leave other things to him, God will not stand with us for these outwards, though we never ask them we shall have them as over measure; God will throw them in as the Vantage. And to this suits the Experience of our dear <hi>Honorathius:</hi> And indeed (saith he, speaking of God) <hi>Honorathius</hi> finds that his onely hiding place and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, and a place of Succour, from the Storms that fall upon him, and hath had such Helps at dead lift there, that he is engaged for ever to trust there. For when he hath been lowest, and in the greatest straights, he hath gone and made his moan Heaven-ward, with free submission to the rightful disposer of all things, and he hath been so liberally supplied, as makes him very confident the best way to obtain any Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, or supply, is to be content to be without it: And he is perswaded nothing sets Gods Mercies farther off, than want of free submission to want them. Certainly, God will never be behind hand with us. Let our care be to Build his House, and let him alone to build ours.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That none ever was, or ever shall be, a loser by Jesus Christ. Many have lost much for him, but never did, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver shall any lose by him. Take this for a certainty, whatsoever probabilities of outward Comforts we leave, whatsoever out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward advantages we balk, that we may glorifie him in our Services, and enjoy him in his Ordinances more than other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65560:72"/>
we could, we shall receive an hundred fold in this Life. 'Tis a sad thing to see how little Christ is trusted or believed in the World: Men will trust him no farther than they can see him, and will leave no work for Faith. Alas, hath he not a thousand ways, both outward and inward, to make up a little outward disadvantage to us? What doth our Faith serve for? Have any ventured themselves upon him in his way, but he made good every word of the Promise to them? let us therefore exercise our Faith, and stay our selves upon the Promise, and see if ever we are ashamed of our hope.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That what is wanting in the means, God will make up in the blessing. This <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> take for a certain truth, while a man commits himself and his affairs to God, and is in a way that God put him into: Now if a man have but a little In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, if he have a great Blessing, that's enough to make it up. Alas, we must not account Mercies by the Bulk. What if another have a Pound to my Ounce, if mine be Gold for his Silver, I will never change with him. As 'tis not Bread that keeps men alive, but the Word of Blessing that proceedeth out of his Mouth of God; so 'tis not the largeness of the Means, but the blessing of the Lord that maketh rich. Oh! if men did but believe this, they would not grasp so much of the World as they do. Well, let others take their course, and we will take ours, to wait upon God by Faith and Prayer, and rest in his Promise; and I am confident that is the way to be provided for: Let others toyl to enlarge their Income, (but alas, they will find they go not the right way to work) we will bless God to enlarge our blessing, and I doubt not but we shall prove the Gainers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sixthly,</hi> That every Condition hath its Snares, Crosses, and troubles, and therefore we may not expect to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them where ever we be, onely that condition is most eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible that hath fewest and least. I cannot Object any thing against the Proposal of <hi>Taunton,</hi> but the meaness of the Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance; but if our Income be but short, we can I hope be content to live answerably, we must fare the meaner, that will be all the inconvenience that Animal know, and truly I hope we are not of the nature of that Animal, that hath his Heart in his Belly. I know how <hi>Daniel</hi> thrived by his Water
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65560:73"/>
and Pulse, and think a mean Diet is as wholsome to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, yea, and sarless hurtful than a full and liberal is; and perswade my self it would be no such hard matter for us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentedly to deny our Flesh in this respect. But let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider how little and utterly inconsiderable this Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is, in comparison of those we must reckon upon meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with, if God cast us into another place, and whether this be not a great deal less than the trouble we shall have for want of comfortable and Christian Society, for want of the frequent and quickening means we shall here have, in wrangling and contending with the Covetous, or else losing our dues, in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Upon these and the like cousiderations, I find my heart very much inclined to accept of their offer at <hi>Taunton.</hi> I beseech thee to weigh, and throughly consider the matter, and tell me impartially thy thoughts, and which way thy Spirit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines, for I have always resolved the place I settled in should be thy choice, and to thy content. The least intimation of thy will to the contrary, shall overballance all my thoughts of settling there, for I should account it the greatest unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness if I should thus settle, and thou shouldst afterwards be discontented at the straightness of our condition. But I need not have Wrote this, hadst not thou fully signified thy mind already to me, I had never gone so far as I have. Well, the Lord whose we are, and whom we serve, do with us as it shall seem good unto him. We are always as mindful as is possible of thee here, both together and apart.

Now, Brethren, is the time when the Lord is like to put you upon the trial; now is the hour of temptation come. Oh! be faithful to Christ to the death, and he shall give you a Crown of life: Faithful is he that hath called you, and he will not suffer you upon his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness to be tempted above what you are able.

If you seek by prayer and study to know the mind of God, and do resolve to follow it in uprightness, you shall not fail either of direction or pardon; Either God will shew you what his pleasure is, or will certainly forgive you if you miss your way.

The God that hath promised to them that give to a <hi>Prophet</hi> though but a cup of cold Water, shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a <hi>Prophets</hi> reward; he will recompence your labour of love, your servent prayers, and constant cryes, your care for my wellfare, your bountiful supplies who have given me, not a cup of cold water, but the Wine of your loves, with the sense and tidings whereof I am coutinually refreshed. I must, I do, and will bless the Lord as long as I live, that he hath-cast my lot in so fair a place, to dwell in your communion; and especially to go in and out before you, and to be the Messenger of the Lord of Host to you, to proclaim his Law, and to Preach his Excellencies, to be his Spokesman to you, and to wooe for him, and to espouse you to one Husband, and to present you as a chaste Virgin unto Christ. Lord! how unworthy am I, everlastingly unworthy of this glorious Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which I do verily believe the most brightest Angels in Heaven would be glad of, if the Lord saw it fit to imploy them in this work! Well, I do not, I cannot repent, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all the difficulties and inconveniences that do attend his despised Servants, and hated ways, and that are like to attend them; for we have but sipped yet of the Cup; but I have set my hand to his plow; my Ministry I took up

with you, and my Testimony I finished with you, though I thought I had espoused you till death: and when I was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into that Sacred Office, which through rich Grace I was imployed in, I told you in the close of what I spake before the laying of the holy Hands upon me (most gladly do I take up this Office with all the persecution, affliction, difficulties an tribulation and inconveniencies that do and may attend it) and blessed be God, I am through his goodness of the same mind still, and my tribulations for Christ, do (to him be Glory, for to me belongs nothing but shame and confusion of face) confirm my choice and my resolution to serve him with much more than my labours. Verily, Brethren, it is a good choice that I have commended to you: Oh! that there might not one be found among you that hath not made <hi>Maries</hi> choice, I mean of that good part which shall never be taken away from you. Brethren, let them take up with the world that have no better portion: be content that they should carry the Bell, and bear away the riches and perferments and glory, and splendor of the World. Alas! you have no reason to envy them: verlly, they have a lye in their right hand: Ah! how soon will their hopes fail them: how soon will the crackling blast be out, and leave them in eternal darkness: they shall go to the generation of their Fathers, they shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver see light, like sheep they shall be laid in their Graves, and the upright shall have Dominion over them in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But for my Brethren, I am jealous that none of you should come short of the Glory of God. I am ambitious for you that you should be all the heirs of an endless life, the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving hopes of the Saints, the inheritance incorruptible, unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, and that fades not away.</p>

I am jealous for you with a Godly jealousie, left a promise be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing left you of entring into his rest, any of you should come short of it. O look diligently, left any man fail of the Grace of God: Alas! how it pities me to see this Rest neglected: How it grieves me that any of you should fall short of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy at last!

Alas! how it pitied me to look over so great a Congregation, and to think that I could not, for my life I could not, perswade them, one quarter of them, in likelihood to be saved? how it moved me to see your diligence in flocking, not only to the stated Exercises, but to the Repetitions and to most ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous opportunities, for which you are greatly to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, since the Law forbad my publike Preaching, and yet to think that many of you that went so far, were like to perish for ever for want of going further.

Wonder not that I so often inculcate this: If it be well here, it is well all; if unfound here, the ertor is in the Foundation, and you are undone. Brethren, I see great tryals coming, when we shall see Professors fall like leaves in the Autumn, unless they be well setled: therefore is it that I would so fain have you look to your standing, and to secure the main. And for you whose Souls are soundly wrought upon, O make sure whatever you do: get and keep your evidences clear! How dreadful would your temptations be, if you should be called to part with all for Christ, and not be sure of him neither: get a right and clear understanding of the terms of life, which I have set before you in that form of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>I Do most readily acknowledge my self a Debtor to you all, and a Servant of all, and therefore I have sent these few Lines to salute you all. My Lines did fall in a fair place when the Lord did cast my Lot among you; for which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to be thankful. God hath been pleased to work a mutual affection between me and you. I remember the Tears and Prayers that you have sent me hither with, and how I saw your hearts in your eyes; How can I forget how you pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out your Souls upon me. And truly you are a People much upon my heart, whose welfare is the matter of my continual prayers, care, and study. And oh! that I knew how to do you good: Ah? how certainly should never a son of you miscarry if I knew how to save you. Ah! how it pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

me to think how that so many of you should remain in your sins after so many and so long endeavours to convert and bring them in. Once more, Oh! my Beloved, once more hear the call of the most high God unto yon. The Prison Preaches to you, the same Doctrine that the Pulpit did. Hear, O People, hear; he that hath an ear let him hear. The Lord of Life and of Glory offers you all Mercy, and Peace, and Blessedness: Oh, why should you die! who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever will, let him take of the Waters of Life freely; what miss of life when it is to be had for the taking? God forbid. O my Brethren, my Soul yerns for you, and my bowels to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you. Ah! that I did but know what Arguments to use with you: who shall chuse my words for me that I may prevail with sinners not to reject their own Mercy: how shall I get within them? How shall I reach them? Oh! that I did but know the words that would pierce them? That I could but get between their sins and them. Beloved Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, the Lord Jesus hath made me, most unworthy, his Spokesman, to bespeak your hearts for him: And oh, that I knew but how to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Once more I desire with all possible earnestness to apply my self to you, I have thought it may be a Sermon out of a Prison might do that which I could not do after my long striving with you, but have left undone <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> then, O Friends, and let us rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son together.</p>
                     <p>Many among you remain under the power of Ignorance: Ah! how often have I told you the dangerous, yea, damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble estate that such are in. Never make excuses, nor flatter your selves that you shall be saved though you go on in this; I have told you often, and now tell you again, God must be false of his Word, if ever you be saved without being brought out of the state of Ignorance: If ever you enter in at the door of Heaven, it must be by the Key of Knowledge, you cannot be saved, except you be brought to the knowledge of the Truth. A people that remain in gross ignorance, that are without understanding, the Lord that made them, will not have mercy on them. O why will you flatter your selves,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65560:78"/>
and wilfully deceive your own selves? when the God of Truth hath said you shall surely die if you go on in this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state: Oh, for the love of God and of your Souls, I beseech you awake and bestir your selves to get the saving knowledge of God: you that are capable of learning a Trade to live by, are you not capable of learning the way to be saved: yea, I doubt not but you are capable if you would but beat your heads about it, and take pains to get it. And is it not pity that you should perish for ever for want of a little pains, and study, and care to get the knowledge of God: Study the Catechism, if possible get it by heart, if not, read it often, or get it read to you, cry unto God for knowledge; improve the little you have by living answerable. Search the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture daily, get them read to you if you cannot read them. Improve your Sabbaths diligently, and I doubt not but in the use of these means you will sooner arrive to the knowledge of Christ than of a Trade. But for thee, O hardned sinner, that wilt make thy excuses that thou hast not time nor abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to get knowledge, and to sit still without it, I pronounce unto thee that thou shalt surely perish: And I challenge thee to tell me, if thou canst, how thou wilt answer it before the most High God when he shall fit in judgement upon thee, that thou wouldest be contented to undergo a seven years Apprentiship to learn how to get thy living, and that thou mightest have got the knowledge of the principles of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in half the time, but thou wouldest not beat thy head about it.</p>
                     <p>Many are swallowed up in meer profaneness: Alas! that there should be any such in a place of such means and mercies! but it cannot be concealed. Many of them proclaim their sin like <hi>Sodom,</hi> and carry their deadly Leprosie in their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads. I am ashamed to think that in <hi>Taunton</hi> there should be so many Alehouse-haunters and Tiplers, so many lewd Gamesters, and Rioters and debauched livers; so many black mouthed Swearers, who have Oaths and Curses for their common language, so many Raylers at Godliness, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sane Scoffers, so many Lyars and deceitful Dealers, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean and wanton Wretches. O what a long list will these and such like make up, if put together: it saddens me to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion such as these. O how crimsen is their guilt! how often
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65560:78"/>

                     <p>Others have escaped the gross pollutions of the World, but stick in the form of Godliness, and content themselves with a negative Righreousness, that they are no Drunkards, nor Swearers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or at best with an outward conformity to the duties of Religion, or some common workings, instead of a saving. O I am jealous for you that you should not lose the things that you have wrought, and miss your reware for want of sincerity: for the Lords sake put on, and beware of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing in the Suburbs of the City of Refuge: beg of God to make through-work with you, and be jealous for your selves; get a right understanding of the difference between a Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cripe and a sincere Christian, and try you estates much, but only with those marks, that you are sure from the Scripture will abide Gods trial.</p>

Let not any that have begun in the Spirit, end in the flesh. Do not forsake God, till he forsake you; he that endureth to the end shall be saved: The Promise is to him that overcometh; therefore think not of looking back: Now you have set your hands to Christ's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Brethren, I beseech you to reckon upon no other but crosses here. Let none of you dream of an Earthly Paradise, or flatter your selves with Dreams of sleeping in your ease, and temporal Prosperity, and carrying Heaven too.

would love his own. But now God hath chosen you, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led you out of the World, therefore the World hateth you: But remember, my Brethren, it is your duty to love them, even while they hate you; and to pray for mercy for them that will shew no mercy, nor do no Justice for us. This I desire you to observe as a great duty of the present times: And let not any so far forget their duty and pattern, as to wish evil to them that do evil to us, or to please themselves with the thoughts of being even with them. Let us commit our selves to him that judgeth righteously, and shew our selves the children of the most High, who doth good to his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and is kind to the unkind and unthankful: And what though they do hate us? Their love, and good-will were much more to be feared, than their hatred, and a far worse sign. Brethren, keep your selves in the love of God; here is Wisdom. O happy Souls, that are his Favourites! For the Lords-sake look to this, make sure of something: look to your sincerity above all things in the World: let not any of you conclude, that because you are of the suffering-par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, therefore all is well: Look to the Foundation, that your hearts be foundly taken off from every sin, and set upon God above as your Blessedness: Beware that none of you have only a name to live, and be no more than almost Christians. For the love of your Souls, make a diligeht search, and try upon what ground you stand, for it heartily pities me to think that any of you should be in so deep, and hazard so much as these must do that will now cleave to the hated ways of people of God, and yet lose all at last for want of being thorow and sound in the main work, I mean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version and Regeneration. None so miserable in all the World as an unsound Professor of Religion now is, for he shall be hated and persecured of the World, because he takes up a Profession, and yet rejected of God too, because he sticks in a Profession: But when once you bear the marks of Gods favour, you need not fear the Worlds frowns: Cheer up therefore, Brethren, be strong in the Lord, and of good courage under the Worlds usage: Fear not, in our Fathers House there is bread enough, and room enough; this is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to comfort us under all the inconveniences of the way, that we have so happy a Home, so worthy a Portion, so
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65560:81"/>
ready a Father, so goodly an Heritage, so sure a Tenure. Oh, comfort one another with these words: let God see that you can trust in his Word: let the World see that you can live upon a God. I shall share my Prayers and loves among you all, and commit you to the Almighty God: the Keeper of Israel that never slumbereth not sleepeth, be your Watchman and Keeper to the end, Farewel.

                        <p>To my most dearly Beloved Friends, the chosen of God in <hi>Taunton,</hi> Grace and Peace.</p>

                     <p>MY heart is with you, though I am Absent, as to my Bodlly presence from you, and therefore as I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten already, so I have now Written to you to stir up your pureminds by way of Remembrance, and to call upon you for your stedfast continuing, and vigorous proceeding in the ways of God. Dear Friends, and fellow Souldiers under Christ the Captain of our Salvation, consider your Calling and Station, and approve your selves as good Souldiers of Jesus Christ, as men of resolution and courage, be discoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with no difficulties of your present Warsare. As for
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:65560:81"/>
humane affairs, I would have you to be as you are, <hi>Men of Peace:</hi> I would have you <hi>Armed not for resisting,</hi> God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, but for <hi>Suffering only,</hi> as the Apostle hints: You should resist, even to the uttermost, striving against Sin. Here you must give no Quarter, for if you spare but one <hi>Agag,</hi> the life of your Souls must go for the life of your Sins: you must make no Peace, for God will not smile on that Soul that smiles on Sin, nor have any Peace with him, that is at peace with his Enemy. Other Enemies you must for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give, and love, and pray for (which I again desire you to mind as one special duty of the times) but for these Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Enemies, all your affections, and all yonr Prayers must be engaged against them; yea, you must admit no Parley: It's dangerous to dispute with Temptations. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what <hi>Eve</hi> lost by Parleying with Satan: you must slie from Temptations, and put them off at first with a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory denial. If you will but hear the Devils Arguments, and the Fleshes Pleas, and fair Pretences, it is an hundred to one but you are insnared by his Sophistry. And for this present evil World, the Lord deliver you from its Snares. Surely you had need watch and be sober, and use your spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Weapons dexterously and diligently, or else this <hi>World</hi> is like to undo you, and destroy you. I have often warned you not to build upon an External happiness, and that you should promise your selves nothing but hardship here: Oh still remember your Station; Souldiers must not count upon Rest, and Fulness, but Hunger, and Hardness. Labour to get right apprehensions of the World. Do not think these things necessary; one thing is needful: You may be happy in the want of all outward comforts. Do not think your selves undone, if brought to Want or Poverty: study Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and you will see it to be little material to you, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you are Poor or Rich; and that you may have never such an opportunity for your advantage in all your lives, as when you put all to hazard, and seem to run the Vessel up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Rocks. Set your enemies one against the other: Death against the World; no such way to get above the World, as to put your selves into the possession of Death. Look often upon your Dust that you shall be Reduced to, and imagine you saw your Bones tumbled out of your Graces, as they are
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65560:82"/>
like shortly to be, and men handling your Skulls, and enquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whose is this. Tell me of what account will the World be then, what good will it do you: put your selves often into your Graves, and look out from thence upon the World, and see what Judgement you have of it then. Must not you be shortly forgot among the Dead? your places will know you no more, and your Memory will be no more among men, and then what will it profit you to have lived in fashion and repute, and to have been Men of esteem? one serious walk over a Church-yard, <hi>as one speaks,</hi> might make a man mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified to the World. Think upon how many you Tread, but you know them not: no doubt they had their Estates, their friends, their Trades, their businesses, and kept as much stir in the World as others do now. But alas, what are they the better for any, for all this? know you not that this must be your own case very shortly: oh the unhappiness of deceived man! how miserably is he bewitched, and befooled, that he should expend himself for that which he knows shall for ever leave him. Brethren, I beseech you lay no stress upon these perishing things, but labour to be at a Holy indifferencie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them: Is it for one that is in his wits to sell his God, his conscience, his soul, for things that he is not sure to keep a week, nor a day, and which he is sure after a few sleepings and wakings more, to leave behind him for ever? go and talk with dying men, and see what apprehensions they have of the World? if any should come to such as these, and tell them here is such and such preferments for you, you shall have such titles of Honour and delights, if you will now disown Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or subscribe to iniquity; do you think such a motion would be embraced? Brethren, why should we not be wise in time! why should we not now be of the mind of which we know we shall be all shortly! woe to them that will not be wise, till it be to no purpose! woe to them whose eyes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Death and Judgement, will open! woe to them that though they have been warned by others, and have heard the Worlds greatest Darlings in Death to cry out of its vanity, worthlesness and deceitfulness, and have been told where and how it would leave them; yet would take no warning, but only must serve themselves to, for warnings to others. All my Beloved, beware there be no worldly Professors among
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:65560:82"/>
you, that will part rather with their part in Paradise, than their part in <hi>Paris;</hi> that will rather part with their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, than with their Estates; that have secret reserves in hearts to save themselves whole, when it comes to the pinch; and not to be of the Religion that will undo them in the World. Beware that none of you have your hearts where your Feet should be, and love your <hi>Mammon</hi> before your Maker. It is time for you to learn with <hi>Paul,</hi> to be Crucified to the World.</p>
                     <p>But it is time for me to remember that 'tis a Letter, and contain my self within my Limits. The God of all Grace, stablish, strengthen, and settle you in these shaking times, and raise your hearts above the fears of the Worlds Threats, and above the Ambition of its favours. My dearest loves to you all, with my servent desire of your Prayers. May the Lord of Hosts be with you, and the God of <hi>Jacob</hi> your refuge.

                        <p>To the Beloved, my most endearing, and endeared Friends, the Flock of Christ in <hi>Taunton,</hi> Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>

                        <salute>Most dearly Beloved and longed for, my Joy and Crown:</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>I Must say of you as <hi>David</hi> did of <hi>Jonathan,</hi> Very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant have you been unto me, and your love to me is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful. And as I have formerly taken great content in that my Lot was cast among you, so through grace I rejoyce in my present Lot, that I am called to approve my love to you by suffering for you; for you, I say: for you know that I have not sought yours but you; and that for doing my duty to your souls, I am here in these Bonds, which I do cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully accept through the grace of God that strengtheneth me. Oh! That your Souls might be quickened and enlarged by these my Bonds! that your hands might be strengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and your hearts encouraged in the Lord your God by our sufferings! See to it, my dearly Beloved, that you stand fast in the power of the Holy Doctrine which we have Preached from the Pulpit; preached at the Bar; preached from the Prison to you: It is a Gospel worth the suffering for: see that you follow after Holiness, without which no man shall see God: Oh! the madness of the blind World, that they should put from them the only Plank upon which they can scape to Heaven. Surely the Enimies of Holiness are their own Enemies. Alas for them! they know not what they do. What would not these foolish Virgins do at last, when it is too late for a little of the Oyl of the Wise; Oh, for
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65560:83"/>
one dram of that Grace which they have scorned and despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. But let not any of you, my dear People, be wise too late: Look diligently lest any man fail of the Grace of God. Beware that none of you be cheated through the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlety of Satan and deceitfulness of your Hearts with counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit grace. There is never a grace but hath its counterfeit: and there is nothing in all the World that is more common or more casie, than to mistake common and counterseit Grace for true and saving: and remember you are undone for evermore, if you should die in such a mistake: Not that I would shake the confidence of any sound Believer, who upon often and through search into the Scripture and his own heart, and putting himself upon Gods tryal, hath gotten good evidence that his Graces are of the right kind: Build your confidence sure: See that you get the knowledge of the certain and infallible marks of Salvation, and make sure by great observing your own hearts that these marks be in you, and then you cannot be too confident. But as you love your souls take heed of a groundless confidence. Take heed of being confident before you have tried. Dear Brethren, I would fain have you all secured against the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; I would that the states of your souls were all well setled: Oh how comfortably might you think of any trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, if you were but sure of your pardons! Were your Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation out of doubt, no matter though other things were in hazard. I beseech you, whatever you neglect, look to this: I am afraid there are among you that have not made your peace with God yet; that are not yet acquainted with that great work of Conversion: such I would warn and charge before the living God to speed into Christ, and without any more disputes or delayes to put away their iniquities, and to come in and deliver up themselves to Jesus Christ, that they may be saved. It is not your Profession, nor performing external duties, nor partaking of external Priviledges that will save you: No, no, you must be converted or condemned. It is not enough that you have some love and liking to Gods ways and people, and are willing to venture something for them; All this will not prove you sound Christians: Have your hearts been changed? Have you been soundly convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of your sins? of your damnable and undone condition
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65560:84"/>
in your selves? and your utter inability to lick your selves whole again by your own duties? have you been brought at least to such a sight and sense of sin, as that there is no sin, though agreeable to your constitution, though a support to your gain, but you do heartily abhor it, and utterly disallow of it? are you brought to such a sense of the beauty of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and of the Laws and ways of God, as that you do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to know the whole mind of God, and would not excuse your selves by ignorance from any duty, and that you do not allow your selves in the ordinary neglect of any thing that conscience charges upon you as a duty? are your very hearts set upon the glorifying and enjoying of God, as your greatest happiness, which you desire more than Corn and Wine and Oyl? had you rather be the holiest than the richest and greatest in the World? and is your greatest delight (ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, and when you are your selves) in the thoughts of God, and in your conversings with God in Holy Exercises? Is Christ more precious than all the World to you? and are you willing upon the through consideration of the strictness, and holiness, and self-denying Nature of his Laws, yet to take them all for the rule of your thoughts, words, and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? and though Religoin may cost you dear, do you resolve if God will assist you by his Grace, to go through with it, let the cost be what it will? happy the man that is in such a case. This is a Christian indeed, and whatever you be and do short of this, all is unsound. But you that bear in your souls the marks of the Lord Jesus above mentioned, upon you I should lay no other burden, but to hold fast, and make good your ground, and to press forward towards the mark. Thankfully acknowledge the distinguishing grace God to your souls: and live rejoycingly in the hopes of the glory of God, the hopes that shall never make you ashamed: live daily in the praises of your Redeemer: be much in admiring God, and study the worthiness, excellency, and glory of his Attributes: let your souls be much taken up in contemplating and commending his glorious perfection, and blessing your selves in the goodly Portion you have in him: live like those that have a God, and then be disconsolate if you can: If there be not more in an infinite God to comfort you, than in a Prison, or Poverty, or other affliction to deject you, our Preaching is vain, and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:65560:84"/>
your Faith is vain. Let the thoughts of God be your daily repast: and never be satisfied till your hearts run out as freely, naturally, constantly, unweariedly after God, as others do after the World: a little force upon your hearts for a while to turn them into this holy Channel, may quickly come so to habituate your minds to holiness, that they may natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally run that way. But it is time to shut up: Farewel, my dear Brethren, the Lord God Almighty be a protection to you, and your exceeding great reward: Farewel in the Lord. I am</p>
                     <p>Just now I received your meking Letter, to which I am not able now to return an answer, but shall with speed: your very great affections for me cannot but move me, and make me ready to repeat again the first words of my Letter above. The Lord inable me to return something to you for your great loves; I am sensible I have come very short of my duty to you; but I must needs tell you, my Bowels are moved with your loves, which I hope I shall greatly prize: once more Farewel.</p>
                     <p>My dear Brother <hi>Norman</hi> remembers you with much love, desiring that you may be blameless and harmless, the Sons of God without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse Nation, among whom ye should shine as lights in the World.</p>

                     <p>I Have received your moving melting Letter, and could not look over <hi>such</hi> tender expressions of your working affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, without some commotions in my own: I may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently say, I spent more Tears upon those Lines, than ever you did Ink: Your deep sense of my labours in the Ministry; I cannot but thankfully acknowledge, and take notice of: yet withal, heartily and unseingedly confessing, that all was but the duty which I did owe to your precious and immortal Souls: which God knows, are very much short of my duty. The omissions, imperfections, defects, deadness, that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied my duties I do own, I must and will own; and the Lord humble me for them. But all that was of God (and that was all that was good) be sure that you give to God alone. To him I humbly ascribe both the Will, and the Deed, to whom alone be Glory for ever.</p>
                     <p>My dear Brethren, my business as I have often told you, is not to gain your hearts, or turn your eyes towards me, but to Jesus Christ: his Spokesman I am, will you give your hearts to him? will you give your hands, your names to him? will you subscribe to his Laws, and consent to his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and be at through defiance with all his Enemies? This do, and I have my Errant. Who will follow Christs Colours? who will come under his Banner? this shall be the man that shall be my Friend; this is he that will oblige me for ever. Do these Letters come to none that are yet unsanctified? to do loose sinner? to no ignorant sinner? to no unfound pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor?
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:65560:85"/>
Oh that there were none such indeed! oh that I had left no such behind me! but would they do me a kindness as I believe they would, oh then let them come away to Jesus Christ at this call! lie no longer O sinner, in thy swill, be no more in love with darkness! stick no longer in the skirts and outside of Religion, demure no longer, dispute not and waver no more, halt no further, but strike in throughly with Jesus Christ, except nothing, reserve nothing, but come off throughly to the Lord, and follow him fully. And then happy man that thou shalt be, for thou wilt be made for ever; and joyful man that I shall be, for I shall save a Soul from death. The earnest and pittiful beggings of a poor Prisoner, do use to move some Bowels: hear O Friends, will you do nothing for a Minister of Christ? Nothing for a Prisoner of Jesus Christ? methinks I hear you answer, [yea, rather what will we not do, he shall never want while we have it; he shall need no office of Love, but we will run and Ride to do it.] Yea, but this is not that I beg of you; will you gratifie me indeed? then come in, kiss the Son, bow to the Name of Jesus; not in a Complement, with Cap and Knee, but let your Souls bow, let all your Powers bend Sail, and do him homage. Let that Sacred Name be Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven into the substance of your hearts, and lie as a bundle of Mirrh between your Breasts. Let me freely speak for him, for he is worthy for whom you shall do this thing; worthy to be beloved of you; worthy to have your very hearts, worthy to be admired, adored, praised, served, glorified to the uttermost by you, and every Creature; worthy for whom you should lay down all, leave all: Can any thing be too much for him? can any thing be too good for him? Or too great for him? come give up all, Resign all, lay it at the Feet of Chrlst Jesus, offer all as a Sacrifice to him, see that you be universally the Lords; keep nothing from him: I know through the goodness of God, that with many of you this work is not yet to do: but this set solemn resignation to the Lord is to be done more than once; and to be followed with an answerable practice when it is done: See that you walk worthy of the Lord? but how? in the <hi>fear of the Lord,</hi> and in the <hi>comfort of the Holy Ghost;</hi> let these two go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. So shall you adorn the Doctrine of God our Saviour:

and experience, the Heavenly felicity of a Christians life: while Holiness is made the Butt of others Persecution, do you make it the white, the <hi>mark</hi> of your prosecution; that you <hi>live it</hi> up, as much as others <hi>cry it down.</hi> O watch, and keep your Garments about you; the plain, but comely clothing of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, the seamless Coat of Christian unity, the strait and close Garment of strictness, mortification and Self-denial, the warm Winter-garment of love and charity, this Garment will keep you warm in the Winter: love will not be quenched by the Waters, nor cooled by the nipping Frosts of persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and opposition. Cleave fast to Christ, never let go your hold; cling the faster, because so many are labouring to knock off your fingers, and loosen your hold. Hold fast your Profession, hold fast your Integrity, hold fast the beginning of your confidence stedfast to the end: If you do but keep your hold, and make good your ground, and keep your way; all that the World can do, and all that the powers of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness can do, can never do you harm. Keep your own Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard with constant care and watchfulness, and be sure that there be no Inroad made upon your consciences, that the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy do not get between you and home, between your souls and God; and then let who or what will assail you without, you need not fear: let this be your daily exercise, to keep your consciences void of offence: keep fair weather at home, however it be abroad. But I would not only that you should walk <hi>holily,</hi> but that you should walk <hi>comfortably:</hi> But I need say the less to this, because the fear of the Lord, and the comfort of the Holy Ghost, do lie together. Oh the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion God hath made for your continual joy and comfort! dear Brethren, do but understand your own blessedness, happy men that you are, if you did but know and consider it; who would count himself poor and miserable that hath All the fulness of the Godhead for his: sound in this deep: can you find any bottom? take the heighth of the Divine Perfections if you can, till then you cannot tell your own felicity. Take a servey of Immensity, tell me the longitude or latitude of infinite goodness and mercy, of the Eternal Diety: if you can do this, you may guess at your own hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness. Oh Christians! live like your selves, live worthy of your Portion, of your Priviledge, and your glorious prerogatives.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:65560:86"/>

Surely methinks I should be content to seal to these things at a much dearer rate than this; but my gratious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will not put me to the hardest Lesson at first: oh what reason have I to speak good of his name! what else should I do all my days, but love, and fear, and preach, and praise, so good a God? when I look back upon the gentle dealings of God with me, I often think he hath brought me up as indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently as <hi>David</hi> did <hi>Adonijah,</hi> of whom it is said, <hi>His Father had not displeased him.</hi> I have received nothing but good at the hands of the Lord all my days; and now he doth begin to afflict, I see so much Mercy in this very Gaol, that I must be more thankful for this than for my prosperity. Surely the name of the place is, <hi>The Lord is here:</hi> Surely it may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Peniel.</hi> Be strong in the Lord, my Brethren, be patient, stablish your hearts, for the coming of the Lord draws nigh. In nothing be terrified by your adversaries. Now let those that fear the Lord be often speaking one to another. I hear that Satan is practising to send more of you after me: I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire and pray for your liberty: but if any of you be forced hither for the the testimony of the Gospel, I shall embrace you with both arms. Fare you well, my most dearly Beloved: be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace, and the God of Love and Peace shall be with you. My Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in Bonds salute you with much affection, rejoycing to behold your order and the stedfastness of your Faith in Christ: share my heart among you, and know that I am</p>

                     <p>MY heart is with you, my affections are espoused to you. And methinks I could even say with the Apostle, (<hi>you are in my heart, to live and die with you:</hi>) and who can but love where they have received so much love (and continually do) as I have from you! the Lord require your love which is great (and if compared with his, but little) with his which is infinite; this is a love worthy of your ambition, worthy of your adoration and admiration. This is the Womb that bore you from eternity, and out of which have burst forth all the Mercies, Spiritual and Temporal, that you enjoy. This was the love that chose you, when less Offenders, and those that being converted, might have been a hundred fold more serviceable to their Makers Glory, are left to perish in their fins: May your souls be filled with the sense of this love. But it may be you will say, how shall I know if I am an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Electing love? least an unbelieving thought should damp your joy; know in short, that if you have chosen God, he hath certainly chosen you. Have you taken him for your blessedness? and do you more highly prize, and more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently seek after conformity to him, and the fruition of him than any, than all the goods of this World? If so, then away with doubts, for you could not have loved, and have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen him, unless he had loved you first. Now may my Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved dwell continually in the thoughts, the views, the tastes of the love. Get you down under its shadows, and taste its pleasant Fruits. Oh the Provisions that love hath made for you, before the Foundation of the World! Ah silly dust, that ever thou shouldest be thought upon so long before thou wast: that the contrivances of the infinite Wisdom, should be taken up about thee! that such a Crawling thing, such a
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:65560:88"/>
Mire, a Flea, should have the consultations of the Eternal Diety exercised about thee! verily his love to thee is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Lord what is man! thou tellest us he is <hi>Dust and Vanity, a Worm, nothing, less than nothing;</hi> how then dost thou love him! oh wonderful! be astonished yea Heavens at this: be moved ye strong foundation of the Earth. Fall down yea El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, strike up ye Heavenly Quires, and sing yet again, <hi>Glory to God in the highest:</hi> for all <hi>our</hi> strings would crack to reach the Notes of love, praise, and admiration that this love doth call for. Oh that ever emptiness and vanity, should be thus prized! that <hi>Jehovah</hi> should make account of so worthless, so useless a thing as man! that ever baseness should be thus preferred! that ever nothing should be thus dignified! that ever rottenness should be thus advanced, a Clod, a shaddow, Potsheard, should be thus glorified! Oh Brethren, study I beseech you, not to require or retaliate (there's impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and blaspemy in such a thought) but to admire and imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate his love. Let love constrain you, let love put you upon doing, and prepare you for suffering; forget not a love so memorable, undervalue not a love so unvaluable; I would have you all the captives of love: may the cords of love draw you towards, and knit you to your Redeemer; may the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided streams be united in him. Alas, that our souls are so narrow, that the Waters are so shallow with us! how little, how very little would our love be, it he had it all, infinitely less than the Glow-worm to the Sun, or the Attome to the Universe? and have we any of this little to spare for him? oh that we might love him with our little All! that all our little powers were ingaged for him! Brethren, here is no excess: oh love the Lord ye his Saints! he is worthy for whom you shall do this. Do but think what love hath done for you, and think if you can, what it means to do for you. This is the love that yarned upon you, when in your Blood no eye pity<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you. This is the love that took you up when you were Robbed, and wounded, and left for dead, and poured in Wine and Oyl into your wounds. This is that love that reprieved, and spared, and pardoned, when the Law had condemned you, and Justice would have had you delivered up; and your Self-condemning consciences gave up all for lost, concluding there was no hope. This is the love, the expensive love
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:65560:88"/>
that bought you from the power of darkness, from the eternal burnings, the devouring fire in which you must otherwise have dwelt. Do you not remember how you were hungry, and it fed you, naked and it cloathed you, strangers and it took you in, sick and it visited you, in Prison and it came unto you? you were dead and are alive, you were lost and are found. And me thinks I see how love runs to meet you, and falls upon your necks, and kisseth the Lips that deserve to be loathed, and rejoyces over you, and makes a Festival, and as it were a Holiday in Heaven for you, inviting Angels to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce. And if the friends do rejoyce, how much more doth the father? for saith he, <hi>These my Sons were dead and are alive, were lost aud are found.</hi> Oh melting love! ah Brethren, how strange is this, that our recovery should be Heavens triumph, the joy of God and Angels. That this love should feast us, and feast over us, and our Birth day should be kept in Heaven: that this should be the round at Heavens Table, and the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of the Songs above: [<hi>For this my Son was dead, and is alive,</hi>] and well, what remains but that you should be ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner of People, than ever yet you have been, more Holy, more humble, more even, more resolved, more lively, more active? where is your Zeal for the Lord of Hosts? will slender returns suffice you in answer to such a love? God forbid. But necessity calls me off from going any further. May the love that chose you, and redeemed you, for ever dwell in you, and overshaddow you, and bear you safe to the Kingdom. In the Holy Arms of Divine Love I desire to leave you. May you live under its daily Influences, and be melted and overcome with its warming Beams, with its quickning, piercing, powerful Rays. My most dear love, to you all. See that you live not in a dull, fruitless, liveless course. Be patient, be watchful, instant in Prayer, servent in Spirit, serving the Lord: I am very healthful and chearful through grace. See that none of these things move you that befal us.

                     <p>I Am by Office a Remembrancer, the Lords Remembrancer for you and your Remembrancer in the behalf of Christ-My business is, with the Apostle, to stir up your pure minds by way of Remembrance. And what or whom should I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member you of, but your most mindful Friend, your Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessour with the Father, who hath you alwayes in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, appearing in the presence of God for you? May his Memory ever live in our Hearts, though mine should die: Oh Remember his Love more than Wine, Remember in what a Case he found you, and yet nothing could anihelate his Heart, nor divert the purpose of his Love from you: He loathed not your Rags nor your Rottenness: He found you in a loathsome Vomit and filthiness, in a nasty and Verminous Tatters, (think not these expressions too odious: No Pen can describe, no Heart can imagine the odiousness of sin in his sight, in which you lay and rolled your selves as the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Swine in the mire) Yet he pitied you, his Bowels were moved, and his Compassions were kindled, when one would have thought his wrath should have boiled and his indignation have burned down to Hell against you: he loathed not, but loved you, and washed you from your sins in his own Blood: Ah monstrous and polluted Captives? Ah vile and putrid Carkases? that ever the holy Jesus should take the hands of you, and should his own self wash you, and wrinse you! methinks I see him weeping over you; and yet it was a
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:65560:89"/>
wore costly Bath by which he cleansed you. Ah Sinners! look upon the streaming Blood flowing out wharm from his blessed Body, to fetch out the ingrained filthiness that you by sin had contracted. Alas! what a horrid filthiness in sin, that nothing but the blood of the Covenant could wash a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way! and what a love is Christs, than when no Sope nor Nitre could suffice to cleanse us, when a whole Ocean could not wash nor purifié us, would opon every vein of his heart to do the work! look upon your crucified Lord: do you not see a sacred stream flowing out of every Member? Ah, how those Holy Hands, those unerring Feet do run a stream to purge us! Alas, how that innocent Back doth Bleed with cruel scourgings to save ours! how the great drops of Blood fall to the ground from his sacred Face in his miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous sweat, in his bitter and bloody Agony, to wash and beautifie ours! how his wounded hearts and side twice pierced, first with love and pity; and then with Souldiers cruelly do pour out their healthful and saving Flouds upon us? Lord, how do we make a shift to forget such a love as this! ah mirrors or rather Monsters of ingratitude, that can be unmindful of such a Friend! do we thus requite him: is this our kindness to such an obliging friend! Christians, where are your affections? to what use do you put your faculties? what have you memories for:but to remember him! What have you the power of loving for, but that you should love him? wherefore serves joy or desire, but to long for him and delightfully to embrace him? may your souls and all their Powers be taken up with him: May all the little Doors of your souls be set open to him. Here fix your thoughts, here terminate your desires; here you may light your Candle and kindle your Fire when almost out. Rub and chase your hearts well with the deep consideration of the love of Christ, and it is a wonder if they do not get some warmth. The Lord shed abroad his love in your hearts by the Holy Ghost: Oh! that this love might constrain you! Brethren what will you do now for Jesus Christ. Have you never a Sacrifice to lay upon his Altar? come, and I will shew you what you shall do, let your hands be in the blood of your sins, fall foul with them, search them out with diligence, search your hearts and your houses; whatever iniquities you find there, out

Godfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid that there should be a lying Tongue, or any way of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit in your Shops. That his service should give place to the World in your Families. Far be it from any of you, my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that you should be careful to teach your children and servants the way of your Trades and Callings, and neglect to instruct them in the way of Life. Is weekly Catechising up in every one of your Families? The Lord convince any of you that may be guilty of this neglect: Oh! set up God in your Houses; and see that you be not slovenly in Closet performances: beware of serving the Lord negligently; serve not the Lord with that which costs you nothing: look to it that you content not your selves with a cheap and easie Religion. Put your flesh to it: be well assured that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion that costs you nothing will yeeld you nothing: keep up the life of Religion in your Family and Closet duties. Fear nothing like a customary and careless performance of Gods Service. Judge your own selves whether lazie wishes, idle complaints, and yawning Prayers are like to carry you through the mighty difficulties that you must get through if ever you come to Heaven. When you find your selves going on in a liftless, liveless, heartless course, and have no mind to your work, ask your selves, is this to take the Kingdom of Heaven by violence, or can I hope to win it without? see that you sacrifice your selves to the Lord, that you deliver up your selves to him, that now you live to Christ himself. As Christ hath made over his life and death to you, so let it be your care to live and die to him: labour to forget your selves and look upon all your enjoyments as Christs goods; upon your time, parts, strength, as his Talents: look upon your selves only in the quality of Servants and Stewards that are to husband all these for your Lords advantage, and as those that must give an account. And pray for me that I may take the Counsel that I give. I bless the Lord, I want nothing but the opportunity of being serviceable unto you, and to enjoy you: but I hope the Lord will make my bonds for you to be useful to your edification; that is the White I aim at, if I may glorifie God, and serve your Souls best by being here, I shall never wish to come out, though I confess

                     <p>I Would my time were as long as my heart, that I might open my self to you; but I was not without some dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content diverted, when I was setting my self to have Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten at large to you. Now I am pinched, however I could not leave my dear charge altogether unvisited, but must needs salute you in a few Lines. Brethren, how stands it with you? doth the main work go on? do your souls pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper? This is my care, beware that you Flag not, that you faint not now in the evil day. I understand that your dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers grow upon you, may your Faith and courage and reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution grow accordingly, and much more abundantly to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>top them. Some of your enemies I hear are in great hopes to satisfie their Lusts upon you: well, be not discouraged my dear Brethren, but bless the Lord who of his abundant Mercy, hat so remarkably preserved you so long beyond all expectation. Let it not be a strange thing to you, if the Lord do now call you to some difficulty: forsake not the Assembling of your selves together, as the manner of some is. I plainly see the Coal of Religion will soon go out, unless it have some better helps to cherish it, then a Carnal Ministrie, and lifeless Administration. Dear Brethren, now is the time for you that fear the Lord, to speak often one to another: manage your duties with what prudence you can, but away with that Carnal prudence, that will decline duty to avoid danger. Is the Communion of Saints worth the venturing for? Shut not up your doors against Godly Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:65560:91"/>
I am told that it is become a hard matter, when a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister is willing to take pains with you to get place: Far be this from you my Brethren. What, shut out the World! sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose there be somewhat more danger to him that gives the Minister entertainment? Is there not much more advantage accordingly? did not <hi>Obed Edom,</hi> and his House, get the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing by entertaining the Ark there? or do you think God hath never a Blessing for those that shall with much Self-denial en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain his Messengers, his Saints, his Worship? are you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, and yet are affraid you shall be loosers by Christ? do you indeed not know that he that runs most hazard for Christ, doth express most love to Christ, and shall receive the greatest reward? away with that unbelief, that prefers the present safety, before the future glory.</p>
                     <p>I left you some helps for daily Ezamination, I am jealous least you should grow slack, and slight, and careless in that duty. Let me ask you in the name of the Lord, doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a day pass you, but you do solemnly and seriously call your selves to an account, what your carriage hath been to God and Men? speak conscience, Is there never an one within the hearing of this Letter, that is a neglecter of this duty? doth every one of your Consciences acquit you? Oh that they did! oh that they could! tell me, would not some of you be put shrewdly to it, if I should ask you when you read or thought over the Questions that were given you for your help? and would you not be put to a blush, to give me an answer? And will you not be much more ashamed, that God and Conscience should find you tardy? not that I would necessarily bind you up to that very Method, only till you have found a way more profitable: I would desire you, yea, methinks I cannot but deeply charge you, to make dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly use of that. Awake conscience, and do thou fall upon that Soul that thou findest careless in this work, and never let him be at rest till thou canst witness for him, that he is a <hi>daily and strict observer of himself,</hi> and doth live in the constant practice of this duty. What shall neither Gods charge, nor your promise, nor profit hold you to your work? yet I may not doubt, but some of you do daily perform this duty. The Lord incourage you in it: yet give me leave to ask you what you have gained? are you grown more universally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:65560:92"/>
more strict, more humble, and more sensible of your many and great defects, then you were before? If so, blessed are you of the Lord; if otherwise, this duty hath been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme but slightly by you. What can you say to this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion? doth your care of your ways abate, or doth it increase, by the constant use of this duty? If it abate, remember from whence you are fallen, and repent; as good not do it at all, as not to the purpose.</p>

                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Consider what a spending time there is coming:</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction and Tribulation seem to be not far from you: had you not need to be well stocked against such a day? go to the <hi>Ant</hi> thou sluggard, she layeth up her meat in the Summer. Happy man that can say to his Soul on good grounds, what he vainly spake, <hi>Thou hast much goods laid up for many years:</hi> Who will not Victual the Castle against the Siege? and the Ship against the Voyage?</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>Consider you will find all little enough when you come to die:</hi> the Wise among the Virgins have no Oyl to spare at the coming of the Bridegroom: distress and temptations, and death will put all your Graces to it. How much ado have many poor Saints had at last to put into this harbour? <hi>David</hi> cries for respire till he had recovered a little more strength.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, <hi>Consider how little it will avail you to thrive in your Estates, and not thrive in your Souls:</hi> Poor <hi>Gehazi!</hi> what did he get by it when he gained <hi>Naamans</hi> Talents, and came off with his Leprofie?</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, <hi>Consider how short your time for gathering in proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility is:</hi> the Israelites gathered twice so much Manna against the Sabbath as they did at other times, because at that time there was no Manna fell. Brethren, you know not how long you have to lay in for.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, <hi>Consider Gods expectations are great from you:</hi> he hath been lopping and pruning you, and now he looks for <hi>more fruit:</hi> he hath had you for some time under his more severer Discipline, and therefore expects you should be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter proficient: he hath tried new means with you, and is come to you with a Rod; and he will be angry with a witness if he do not find you now to mend. Times of Afflictions use to be gaining times to Gods People; God forbid that you alone should be losers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="49" facs="tcp:65560:93"/>Do you ask for marks how you may know your souls be in a thriving case?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First, If your appetites be more strong.</hi> Do you thirst after God, and after grace, more than heretofore? do your cares for and desires after the World abate? and do you hunger and thirst after righteousness! whereas you were wont to come with an ill-will to holy duties, do you come to them as a hungrie Stomach to its Meats?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly, If your Pulses meat more even.</hi> Are you still off and on, hot and cold. Or is there a more even spun thred of holiness through your whole course? do you make good the ground from which you were formerly often beaten off?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly, If your Natural heat do grow more vigorous, and your digestion more quick.</hi> Do you take more notice of God in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing, than heretofore? and let none of his works, nor words pass without some careful attention, and observation? do you ponder upon, and pray over his Word, and his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly, If you do look more to the Compass, and latitude of Religion, and mind more than ever, the carrying on together the duties of both Tables.</hi> Do you not only look to the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing if your own Vineyards, but do you begin to look more abroad, and to lay out your selves for the good of others, and are filled with zealous desires for their conversion, and salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? do you manage your talk and your Trade, by the rules of Religion?</p>
                     <p>Do you eat and sleep by rule? doth Religion form, and mould, and direct your carriage towards Husband, Wife, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, Children, Masters, Servants! do you grow more uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally conseiencious?

                        <hi>Fifthly, If the duties of Religion be more easie, sweet, and delightful to you.</hi> Do you take more delight in the Word than ever? are you more in love with secret Prayer, and more abundant in it? cannot you be content with your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Sixthly, <hi>If you are more abundant in those duties which are most displeasing to the Flesh.</hi> Are you more earnest upon the duty of Mortification? are you more strict and severe than ever in the duty of daily Self-examination, and holy Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? do you hold the Reigns harder upon the Flesh than ever? do you keep a stricter watch upon your Appetites? do you set a stronger guard upon your Tongues? have you a more jealous eye upon your hearts?</p>

Do you grow more out of love with mens esteem, and set less by it? are you not marvellous tender of being slighted? can you rejoyce to see others preferred before you? can you heartily value, and love them that think meanly of you?</p>
                     <p>Eighthly, <hi>If you grow more quick of sense, more tender of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, more sensible of Divine influences, or withdrawings.</hi> Are you more affraid of sin than ever? are your sins a greater pain to you than heretofore? are your very infirmities, your great afflictions? and the daily workings of corruption a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual grief of mind to you?</p>

                     <p>I Have been through mercy many years with you, and should be willingly so many years a Prisoner for you, so I might eminently and effectually further your Salvation. I must again, yea again, and again thank you for your abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant and intire affections to me, which value as a great mercy, not in order to myself, if I know my own heart, but in order to your benefit, as I may thereby be a more likely, Instrument to further your good. Surely, so much as I do value your love, which is not a little, yet had I rather (if I am not unacquainted with my self) be forgotten and forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of you all, and buried in oblivion, So that your eyes and hearts might be hereby fixed on Christ, and sincerely engaged to him. Brethren, I have not bespoken your affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions for my self: O that I might win your hearts univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally to Jesus Christ, though I had lost them for ever! O that I might be instrumental to convert, you to him though you were diverted from me. I am perswaded that I should much rather choose to be hated of all, so this might be the means to have Christ honoured, and set up savingly in the hearts of you all. And indeed there is nothing great but in order to God; nothing is much material or considerable as it is terminated in us: It matters not whether we are in Riches or poverty, in sickness or Health, in honour or disgrace, so Christ may be by us, magnified in the condition we are
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:65560:95"/>
in. Welcome Prison and Poverty, welcome Scorn and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, welcome pains or contempt, if by these Gods glory may be most promoted. What are we for but for God? what doth the Creature signifie separated from his God? why just so much as the Cypher separated from the Figure, or the letter from the Syllable, we are nothing or nothing worth, but in reference to God and his ends. Better were it that we had never been, than that we should not be to him. Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that we were dead than we should live, and not to him. Better that we had no understandings than that we should not know him. Better that we were Blocks and Bruits than that we should not use our Reason for him. What are our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests unless as they may be subservient to his Interest? or our esteem or reputation, unless we may hereby glorifie him? do you love me? I know you do: but who is there that will leave his sins for me? I mean at my requests: with whom shall I prevail to give up himself in strictness and self denial to the Lord? who will be intreated by me to set upon ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected duties, or reform accustomed sins? O wherein may you rejoyce me? in this, in this, my Brethren, in this you shall befriend me, if you obey the voice of God by me, if you be prevailed with to give your selves up throughly to the Lord? would you lighten my burden? would you loosen my bonds? would you make glad my heart? let me hear of your own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ways and servants of the Lord in adversity, of your coming in, of your abiding and patient continuing in the ways of holiness. O that I could but hear that the prayer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Souls, the prayerless Families among you, were now gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to prayer! that the prosane sinner would be awakened, and be induced by the preaching of these Bonds, which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore would not be prevailed with, to leave their drunkenness their loose company, their lying and deceit, and Wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, by all the threatnings of God that cou'd be pronounced against them, nor all the beseechings, wooings, and entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that I was able to use with them! will you not be made clean? when shall it once be? how long shall the patience of God wait for you? how long shall the Lord Jesus stretch our his hands toward you? O sinners, cast your selves into his Arms? Why should you die? Why will you forsake your
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:65560:96"/>
own Mercy? will you perish when mercy wooes you? con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess and forsake your sins, and you shall find mercy: will you part with Christ, and sell your Souls to perdition for a little ease and delight to your flesh? or a little of the gain of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness? or a little Ale or vain mirth, or loose com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany? why these are the things that part between Sinners and Christ.</p>
                     <p>I know many are spun with a finer thred, and are not so far from the Kingdom of God, as the prayerless, ignorant, Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-breaking, intemperate sort are. But I must once again warn you of staying in the Suburbs of the City of Refuge. O what pity is it that any should perish at the Gates! that any should escape the pollutions of the world and do many things, yea, and suffer it may be too, and yet should fall short of the glory of God, for want of a through work of grace! Oh you halting Christians, that halt between Christ and the World, that are as <hi>Ephraim</hi> like a Cake not turned, dow-baked, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors, that have Lamps without Oyl, that cry, Lord, Lord, but do not the will of our Father which is in Heaven! how long will you stay in the place of the breaking forth of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren? and stick between the Womb and the World? your Religion will carry you among the profane despisers of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, but do own the people of the Lord, and do love the Ministers and Ordinances, therefore all is well. I tell you, God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness is a heart-work, it goes deep, and spreads far: unless the frame of your hearts, and the drists of your course be changed, unless you be universally conscientious, and unreser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly delivered up to the Lord for all times, and conditions whatever be the cost, you are none of Christs, how far soever you go in common workings and external performances. Hear then, O people, and let nor profaneness swallow you up: let not an almost Christianity deceive you, orignorance carry you blindfold to perdition. Oh the thousands, and ten thousands that have been undone by one of these! Ah how often have you been warned against them, least you should split against these dangerous Rocks. O <hi>Jerusalem, Jerusalem,</hi> said Christ, and O <hi>Taunton, Taunton,</hi> may I say from him, how often? who can tell how often, would Gods servants have gathered you, and you would not? many, very many of you would not. But will you now? will you <hi>yet</hi> come in? I cannot
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:65560:96"/>
forbear once more, even out of the Prison to call after poor Sinners, and make one tender of mercy more. O come to the Waters of Life, wash you, make you clean; read with diligent observation, the melting passages, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 22. <hi>to the end, Isa.</hi> 1. 16, 21. <hi>Isa.</hi> 55. 6, 10. Oh obdurate Sinners, if none of these things move you!</p>
                     <p>But for you, whose very hearts are set against every sin, and are deliberately resolved for God and Holiness before all the Worlds delight; you that have experience of a thorow change, and are brought to have respect to all Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, who will have none but God for your happiness, none but Christ for your Treasure, that must and will have him, come what will come, blessed are you of the Lord: O happy Souls rejoyce in the Lord, and again, I say, Rejoyce: let your Souls magnifie the Lord, and your spirits rejoyce in God your Saviour. Live you a life of praise, you are highly favoured of the Lord, your Lines are fallen in a pleasant place: only stick you fast to your choice: Beware lest any man beguile you of your reward: watch and keep your Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments about you, lest you walk naked, and men see your shame. Many will be plucking to pull you out of Christs hands; but the harder they pluck, the harder do you cling, and cleave to him, and the better hold fast do you take of him: Blessed is he that overcometh.</p>
                     <p>And now the God of Heaven fill you all with himself, and make all Grace to abound in you, and toward you, and that he may be a Sun to comfort you, and a Shield of protection to you, and shine with his happy Beams of Grace and Glory on you all: Farewel in the Lord, I am</p>

Beloved, I am, without a Complement the devoted servant of your souls prosperity, and the interest of Christ in you: may the Lord Jesus be set up higher in your hearts; may his name ever live in you, and be magnified by you, and I have what I ask. If this work be not promoted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, I shall account all my letters but waste Paper, and all my pains but last labour. Brethren, I beseech you, that none of you live to your selves, for this were directly to cross the very end of Christ's death: for therefore he died that you should not live to your selves, 2 Cor. 5. 15. Oh live to him that died for you! live to him that is the God of your life! live to him that bought your lives with the expense of his own! To him that bought you from destruction; and not only so, but bought your names into the eternal Inheritance, reserved in the Heavens for you. Will a man be easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded to lose his life? how infinitely tender are men here! And yet in the worst sence the most of men do lose their lives, yea, lose them for nothing. Beloved, consider, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you, that life is lost, that is not lived unto God. If you would not loss your lives that you live, see to him who is the end of your lives. Oh remember this, and reckon that day lost which you have not lived unto God! Brethren, how great a part of our lives have we really, alas! too too really lost? I beseech you take heed: here you are careful about many things, but be beware that other things do not put out this which should be the main of your cares, to wit, the spend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your days and strength for him that made you. Would it not be dreadful for a man to find at last when he comes
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:65560:97"/>
to his account with God, that his whole life, or at least the main of it had been but damnable self-seeking. That a man should have so many years allowed him by God, and he should at last be found to have been but a false and wicked servant that had set up for himself with his Masters stock, and aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his goods, and turned them to his own use? Well, that you may throughly learn the grand lesson of living unto God, take these Counsels.</p>
                     <p>First, <hi>Settle it upon your heart that it is the sum of all your business and blessedness to live unto God:</hi> 'Tis your <hi>business;</hi> for his pleasure you are and were created: what have you else to do but to serve your Maker in your general and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Callings? what was the Candle made for (saith one) but to be burnt? beloved, what else have you strength for, but for God? doth he maintain servants, and shall not he look for their Work? Would you endure it that the servants that you find with meat and wages should set up for themselves, that they should eat your bread and all the while do their own work? beloved, Gods service is your business, and he made you and keeps you for no other end; and it is your blessedness too. Labour to be under the rooted conviction of this principle, that your very happiness lies in pleasing and honouring of God. Let the sense of this live fresh upon your hearts, and it will regulate your whole course.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Remember what a dangerous, yea, damnable thing it is to live your selves:</hi> To make it our main care and busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to please and gratifie our selves, or to have applause from and reputation with others, or to grow rich in the world, and greaten our selves and posterity, is the certain evidence of a graceless heart. And though the Godly do make God their principle end in general, yet they must know, that for so much of their lives as is spent besides, this end (which is too too much) they shall suffer loss.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Labour to keep alive upon your selves a deep sense of your strong obligations to Good.</hi> Often think with your selves what a righteous, what a reasonable thing it is, that you should with all that you have serve the Lord. Beloved, shall not the Vessel be for the use of the Porter that made it? Shall not the servant Trade for his Master with whose goods he is entrusted? do you not fetch all your bread from Gods door?
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:65560:98"/>
Is not he the Rock that begat you? the Author of your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and well-being? is not this he that can crucifie you or release you? can save you or damn you at his pleasure? Is it not from him that you fetch every breath? your interest ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges you to please him. Why should <hi>Beltshazzars</hi> charge be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst you? that the God in whose hand your breath is, and whose are all your ways, you have not glorified, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. 23.</p>
                     <p>Fonrthly, <hi>Do not only intend God as the general end of your course, but in every solemn action actually mind your end.</hi> Though a man need not, cannot think of his Journeys-end at every step, yet with care he might come to this in every solemn action, particularly and expressy to mind his end: a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not (nor need he) think at every bit that he puts into his mouth, I will eat this for God: yet he might every time he sits down to his Table, remember to eat and drink, not to gratifie his flesh, but to glorifie God, by getting strength for his work. you cannot think of it in every step in your Journey; but without intending some glory to God by serving his will in your place and station? and so in your visits and labours.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, <hi>Every morning let this be your first and firm resolution, I will set forth this day in the Name of God.</hi> Your first and last thoughts are of greatest consequence; and therefore I advise you to begin and end with this: when ever you lie down, say in your selves, I will make use of my Bed as an Ordinance of God, that a Servant of his may be refreshed and fitted for his work: when ever you rise up, think I will spend this day for God, and follow the business of my calling, because I am so appointed by God, <hi>Zech.</hi> 10. 12. And <hi>they shall walk up and down in his Name, saith the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Beloved, I design the sweetness and comfort, as well as strictness of your lives. Live to God as you are directed, and you shall marvellously prosper in both. I am not sure yet, whether or no I shall see you at the Assizes, which I earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly desire to do. I leave all things to our Fathers wise dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal, and commending you to God, I divide my loves among you, and so rest</p>

                        <p>To my most Dearly Beloved, the Servants of Christ in <hi>Taunton,</hi> Grace and Peace.</p>

                        <salute>Most dear Christians,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>YOur Prisoner in the Lord saluteth you with all dearness: you are the care of my heart, the desire of my Eyes, the joy of my Bonds, and the sweet of my liberty. I am much satisfied in the wise disposal of our Heavenly Father, whether he see it good for me to be a Bond-man, or a Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, so I may but serve your Souls to the greatest adventage. Methinks I begin to feel in my self, more than ever the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of your Prayers; the influences of Heaven, through the riches of Free-Grace (to which alone be the Praise) being more fully sensible, and sweet upon me. I hope the Lord will restore us one to another in his time, much better than we parted; in the mean time, see that you stand fast in the hope of the Gospel. The Lord taketh infinite care for you, see that it be your care, the care of your very hearts, to please the Lord: Set your hearts to it as the business of your lives, and the very end of your beings, to walk worthy of the Lord unto all well-pleasing. Set home on your selves such considerations as these.</p>
                     <p>First, <hi>It is the very business you were made for, and sent into the world for, to please your Maker.</hi> For his pleasure you are, and were Created. Why should the Lord repent that he had made you? <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 6. What treacherous and damnable falshood is this, that when the Lord hath given us Breath and Being, and sent us into the World on purpose on his service, we should like false and wicked servants, set up for our selves? why should your Creator say, he hath made you in vain?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="60" facs="tcp:65560:99"/>Secondly, <hi>If you set your hearts to please the Lord, you are sure you shall please him.</hi> It is not so with men, all the care in the World will not suffice to please some men. How often do Princes forsake their greatest Favourites? so that if you set to please men, you are not sure to attain your end at last; yea, rather you are sure not to attain it. But if the Lord doth see your very hearts be set to please him, he will accept you, though you come short, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 12. Read that sweet passage, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6. 75.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>It will be a certain sign of your sincerity, when the pleasing of the Lord is your greatest business, Phil.</hi> 1. 20. To such the Promise runs, <hi>Isa.</hi> 56. 4, 5. It is a distinguishing evidence, truly to seek and prize Gods favour, more then Corn Wine, <hi>Psal.</hi> 4. 6, 7.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>This will set all in order, and bring all your busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to a Head, when you have set down this as the one thing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, that you are resolved to please the Lord, this will regulate your whole lives, and bring all your business into a little compass.</hi> A Christian hath but <hi>one thing</hi> to do in all conditions, and that is to carry it so in his present state, as that he may please God. A man-pleaser: <hi>O how many hath he to please!</hi> what an endless work hath such an one to do?</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, <hi>Consider but how careful the Man-pleasiing Parasite, and time-serving Hypocrite is to please men:</hi> and shall not we take as much care to please our God? oh how doth the flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Courtier study the humour of his Prince! be you as careful to study, and to be acquainted with the mind of God. What will not men do to screw themselves into the favour of the Mighty? oh that you were but as diligent, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied, and punctual in your endeavours, to get and to keep the favour of the Almighty!</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, <hi>Consider whose favour or displeasure is of that conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to you, as the Lords is of.</hi> What if men should be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with you, have they the Keys of Hell, and of Death? no, no, fear them not. Can they undo your souls? can they send you to Hell? Alas they cannot. See that you dread his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure that can. Alas what will their favour avail you? if they be pleased, can they stand between the Wrath of God and you? can they pardon your sins? save your souls? se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure your Eternal concernments? where is all there favour

                        </opener>
                        <p>I Am now a Prisoner of the Lord for you <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and therefore have sent these few Lines, to beseech you by these Bonds which I gladly endure for your sakes, to hold forth, and hold fast the Profession of your Faith without wavering. The Lord make you stedfast in the Holy Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine wherein you have been taught. I have not shunned to declare unto you the whole Counsel of God. O remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that by the space of eight years, I ceased not to warn you every one, and kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have taught you publickly, and from House to House, warning every man, and teaching every man that I might present every man perfect in Christ Jesus. Oh that Impenitent sinners would yet remember the Invitations, and the obsecrations, and the obtestations, that they have had! have they not been sought unto? have they not been intreated? have they not been followed from the Publick, to their own Houses? hath not the Word been brought to their Doors? Hath not Mercy wooed them? have they not been called un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Wings of Mercy? And yet they would not. Oh that they would consider it now in the latter days! <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 20. Oh that they would remember, and repent, that there might be yet an after Harvest! That they would yet come in and live! Are you yet willing to turn? hear how Wisdom calls after you, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11. <hi>How long ye simple ones</hi>
                           <pb n="63" facs="tcp:65560:100"/>
                           <hi>will you love simplicity, and fools bate knowledge: turn you at my reproof.</hi> But if they will not hear, good were it for them that they had never been born: It shall be more, and better for <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorah,</hi> then for them.</p>
                        <p>But for you that have taken upon you the Profession of strict Godliness, I shall only press you to follow on, and press towards the Mark. You have much work yet to do, and God hath given you no time to Loyter in. I beseech you to put on. That Person that sits down when he hath gotten to that pitch that he thinks will bring him to Heaven, is never like to come thither; Grace is one of those things that saith, <hi>It never hath enough.</hi> Let me urge upon you the Apostles Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 14. <hi>Follow after Holiness.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>First,</hi> Holiness is the choicest Ornament: it is and adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the sight of God, of great prize. It is the Glory of God, and will you count it your shame? <hi>Exod.</hi> 15: God is glorious in Holiness, and Grace is called Glory, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18. But we may now cry out as the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> in his complaint, <hi>O ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into shame? Ps.</hi> 4. 2. But be of good comfort, the shame of Holiness is real Glory: how confidently doth <hi>Paul</hi> shake his Chain? <hi>Acts</hi> 28. 20. We read of some that did glory in their shame in a sad sense, that is in that which was real ground of shame, to wit, their sin, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 19. But we meet with others that in a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py sense, did glory in their shame: that is in the shame of Religion, which is indeed a Crown of glory. So did <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> Acts 5. 41.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> Holiness is the safest Muniment: Grace is not onely for Ornament, but for Use. Righteousness is a Brest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate that keeps the Vitals, and is sure defence from any mortal wounds, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6. 14. When the Politicians have done their best with all their politick fetches, it is he <hi>that walketh uprightly, that walketh surely, Prov.</hi> 10. 19. <hi>Let integrity and uprightness preserve me,</hi> saith <hi>David, Psa.</hi> 25. last. I desire no other Protection than Innocency. I desire to be no longer safe than these can preserve me; when I must let go my Integrety or my sasety, I will chose the danger rather than the fin: and yet will never doubt but my Integrity will save me harmless, and prevent me for ever coming off a Loser. Never perswade me that that man doth choose wisely
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:65560:101"/>
or will consult his own safety, that runs upon the displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the infinite God, who is a devouring fire, to flie the danger of mans displeasure. Did you ever read or hear of a man so mad as to run upon the swords point, to avoid the scratch of a Pin? or to run upon a roaring Canon, rather than indanger his being wetshod? why this is the best wisdom of the distracted World, who will sin rather than suffer, and to save themselves harmless in the World, will run upon God, even upon his neck, and the thick Bosses of his Buckler, <hi>Job</hi> 15. 25, 26.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Holiness will be found to be your real happiness: Eat of this Tree, and you shall be indeed as God. Godliness is Gods likewise. The beauty of Holiness is this very Image; Sin is the disease of which holiness is the Cure. Pride is the Timpany, passion the Feavour of the mind; how restlesly raging is the mind where they reign? holiness, humility, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, are a present ease, a present Cure, if the Patient can take but enough. O what peace and tranquility doth Holiness work in the Mind! <hi>Great peace have they that love thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and nothing shall offend them, Psalm</hi> 119. 165. Read <hi>Isa.</hi> 48. 18, 22. and 26. 3. and 32. 17. Holiness will be a Treasure of Riches, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 5. and a Crown of honour, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 11. a Paradise of Pleasure to you, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 17. In a word, holiness is the perfection of mans nature, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 21. the Communication of the Divine Nature, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. the earnest of Glory, <hi>Matt.</hi> 5. 8. and the very entrance of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 20.</p>
                        <p>Let me say now to every one of you, as our Saviour to <hi>Martha, John</hi> 11. 26. <hi>Believed thou this?</hi> If you do, live like Believers, and do you follow after Holiness as others follow their Trades, or Studies. Let Religion be your business, and not a thing by the by with you: follow as hard upon the pursuit of Grace, as if you did indeed believe riches and honour were in it. Count your selves well, as long as you keep within the line of your duty. Let holiness sit in your Lips, and season all your Speech with grace. Profess it, own it, plead stoutly and resolve for it, be you Advocates for Holiness, in an Adulterous and wicked Generation, wear it as a Robe of honour, when the spightful World cast the dung of their Reproaches at you for it: let it dwell
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:65560:101"/>
in your Hearts: Let it adorn your Houses: Let it be your Companion in your Closets: Let it Travel with You in your Journies: Let it Lie down and Rise up with You: Let it close your Eyes in the Evening, and call You out of your Beds in the Morning. Be You the Votaries of Holiness: Keep Her, and She shall Keep You.</p>
                        <p>I shall close with my Loves to You all, onely because I know You love to hear of my Well-fare: I must tell You that Goodness and Mercy do follow me perpetually every Day, and every Night, Glory to God in the highest. Dear Brethren, Fare you well in the Lord, I am</p>

                     </opener>
                     <p>MY heart is solicitous for You: Your Spiritual and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal welfare is the matter of my desires and designes. Let not my Beloved think they were forgotten by me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause you heard not from me the last Week: sleep depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from my eyes to write to you at large; but in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I concluded it best, to defer the imparting of it to You for a season, that you might have it a better way. Can a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man forget her Child, that she should not have compassion on the Son of her Womb? Yea, they may forget; but Christ will earnestly remember You still. Natural Parents may be so far unnatural; spiritual Parents may be so far carnal, as to forget their own Children: I would have you count nothing as certain but Christs love and care. This you may build upon: You need not fear lest time and distance should wear out the remembrance of you with him: Your names are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled in the everlasting Decrees of Heaven, and a whole E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity hath not been able to wear them out. Do any of you Question whether you are so happy as to have your Names recorded above? I shall bring it to a speedy issue: Do you Question whether Christ hath taken your Names? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you are upon his heart? Let me ask you, Is <hi>Heaven upon your Hearts?</hi> Is the Name of Jesus deeply engraven upon your Souls? Is his Image and Superscription there? If you can find that Heaven is the main of your cares, that your hearts are set upon it as your home and your Countrey; and that it is your great business to seek it and to secure it, then
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:65560:102"/>
never doubt, if your hearts be chiefly upon Heaven, your Names are unquestionably written in Heaven. Again, hath Christ recorded his Name in your hearts? Is the Name of Jesus the Beloved name with you? precious above all; next to your Hearts? Is there no other Name under Heaven so dear and sweet to you? What room hath Christ in you? If any thing be deeper in your hearts than he is, you are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound. As the Father hath given him, so do your hearts give him a Name above every Name: Is Christ uppermost with you in your estimations and affections? Then rejoyce and leap for joy, for your Names are most pretious with Christ, if his Name be above all dear to You. Once more, hath Christ drawn out his own similitude upon You? Is Christ within You? doth he dwell in your Hearts? Then be sure You have a room in his heart: The Image of Christ is in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness. Is this that which your very hearts are set upon? Do You thirst for Holiness? Do You follow after Holiness? Do you prize it above all Prosperity and worldly Greatness? Do You hate every sin and long to be rid of it as your most irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some burden? and use all Gods means against it as far as you know them? If it be thus with you, Christ hath set his stamp upon your hearts, and so you may be sure he hath set You as a Seal upon his heart.</p>
                     <p>Rejoyce then, O Christians, and bless your selves in the happy priviledge that you have, in being under Christs care. Fear not little Flock; Stronger is he that is with you, than he that is against you: What though Satan should raise all his Militia against you, adhere to Christ in a patient doing and suffering his pleasure, and he shall secure you: The Lord will not forsake you, because it hath pleased the Lord to make you his people: God hath entrusted you with his Son: You are his Care and his Charge: Many will be listing at you, many will be plucking at you, but fear not, you shall not be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, none shall pluck you out of Christs hand, he hath all power, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 8. Can Omnipotence secure you? He is all Treasures, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 3. Can unsearchable Riches suffice you? In a word, he is all Fulness, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 21. Can <hi>all</hi> Content you? Can Fulness fill you? if so, you are blessed and shall be blessed.</p>

                        <pb n="68" facs="tcp:65560:103"/>Beloved, We lose unutterably for want of considering, for want of viewing our own Priviledges, and Blessedness. O Man, is Christ thine, and yet dost thou live at a low rate and Comfort? Is thy name written in Heaven, and yet dost thou not rejoyce? Shall the Children of the Kingdom, the Candidates of Glory, the chosen Generation, the Royal Priesthood, be like other men? O Christians, Remember who and whence you are, consider your Obligations, put on a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pace; Bestir your selves, run and wrestle, and be strong for the Lord of Hosts (and earnestly, yet peaceably) contend for the Faith once delivered to his Saints; What shall we make nothing of all that God hath said and done for us? Christians, shall he that hath gotten an inrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Office boast of his Booty? or he that hath obtained the Kings Patent for an Earldome, glory in his Riches and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour? And shall the Grant of Heaven signifie little with thee? Or Christs Patent for thy Sonship and Partnership with himself be like a Cypher? Shall <hi>Haman</hi> come home from the Banquet with a glad heart, and glorying in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his Riches, the multitude of his Children, and all the things wherein the King had promoted him above the Princes? And shall we turn over our Bibles and read the Promises, and find it under Gods own hand, that he intends the Kingdome for us, that he will be a Father to us, that he gives and grants all his infinite perfections to us, and yet not be moved? Beloved Christians, live like your selves, let the World see that the Promises of God, and Priviledges of the Gospel are not empty sounds, or a meer Crack. Let the Heavenly cheerfulness and the restless diligence, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly raisedness of your Conversations prove the reallity, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, and beauty of your Religion to the World.

                        <p>To the most Beloved People, the Servants of God in <hi>Taunton,</hi> Salvation:</p>

                     </opener>
                     <p>I Have longed and waited for a little breathing time, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I might write unto you, but I have been oppressed hitherto with so many cares, and such a throng of business, that till now (and scarcely now) I have had no time of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration, wherein I might sufficiently reflect on you, or my self. But although so great a part of <hi>Taunton</hi> be translated to <hi>Juelchester</hi> with me, yet I may not, I cannot forget you that are behind.</p>
                     <p>Alas poor <hi>Taunton,</hi> how should I bewail thee! did I look upon thee onely with the Eye of sense, Alas! for thy wonted Liberties, for thy former plenty, and variety wherewith the Lord hath blessed thee? He had
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:65560:104"/>
spread a Table for thee in the midst of thine Enemies; Bread hath been given thee, and thy Waters have been sure: But now a Famine seems to threaten thee, and the Comforters that should relieve thy Soul are far from thee. Thy Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards are removed. Thou seest not thy Signs, nor thy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and thy wonted helpers are now disabled from giving thee supplies, Alas, how do thine Enemies triumph, and thy Teachers and thine Inhabitants are become their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives! and how great is the Cry of thy Poor, and thine op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed!</p>
                     <p>Such would be the Language of Sense, if that were suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be the Speaker. But Faith will speak in another Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect. And therefore amongst my other Counsels, that I shall send you, this shall be the first.</p>
                     <p>Judge not of the present Providences, by the conduct of Sense, but by the eye of Faith. Faith will see that we are then most Honoured, when we are most vilified, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, and set at nought for the sake of <hi>Christ;</hi> and that we are then most happy, when the World hath done its worst to make us miserable. Faith will tell you; that GOD is a very present help, when you seem quite to fail of Help; and will shew you the Well of Water, that is near, when the Water in the Bottle is spent. What though you seem to have lost Ministers, Husbands, Friends for a Season? Faith will tell you, that they are well bestowed, and that it will be both your, and their Advantage, in the Day of Retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution.</p>
                     <p>Brethren, what are you for? Are you for the present World, or for that to come? Are you for your Temporal enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or do you seek for Glory, Honour, and Immortall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? If you are for this World, you have made a very impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent choice, in taking up the Profession of Godliness and cleaving to and owning the hated ways of the Lord; But if you are for Glory, and for Eternity, then be of good Chear, all these things do make for us. You are Witnesses how often I have told you of these things, and I can say with the Apostle, I believed therefore have I spoken, and therefore I am no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing moved with all these things, nor with the things that do yet further abide me. I believed, and therefore I told you, that you should never be losers by <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi> Nay,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:65560:104"/>
do I say I told it you, You know the Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed you, that the Persecuted are doubly blessed; that such should rejoice, and leap for joy, because great is their Reward in Heaven. Hath not God said, that if we suffer with him we shall also Reign with him; and that these light afflictions work for us a weight of Glory? And if this be true, I pray you, tell me whether GOD heth not dealt well with us in counting us worthy of this little Tribulation for his Name? Indeed the Sufferings is but little; but verily the Reward will not be little. I know whom I have trusted: I am well assured the Glasse is turned up, and ever hour reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned of our imprisonment, and every Scorn and Reproach of our Enemies is kept in Black and White. I believe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do I speak; GOD is infinitely tender of us, my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, though a Poor and despicable Generation. I value not the pop-gun threats of a frowning World; 'tis well with us, we are GODS Favourites. Come by Beloved, let us sit down under his Shadow: Here is safety, and rest, if God be for us, who can be against us; Verily he Bottles all our Tears, and tells all our Wandrings: He numbers all our hairs, whosoever toucheth us shall not be Innocent. Know you not that we are the Apple of his Eye? Hath not he reproved the greatest for his Peoples sakes, saying, reproach not mine anointed? And so we forget how he loved us. Are not we his Jewells? Doth he not own us for his Members, for his Children?</p>
                     <p>Ah what a Block doth Unbelief make of man? What, do you think that all this doth signifie nothing? Can you forget your Children? Will you suffer your Jewells to lie in the Dirt, or make no reckoning of them whether they are lost?</p>
                     <p>Verily I write not this without shaming reflectious upon my own stupidity. What, Beloved of God, adopted by God! What, a Member of Christ Jesus! A vessel of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy! An heir of Glory? What, and not yet swallowed up in the sense of Gods infinite love! Blush, Oh my Soul, and be confounded before the most High, &amp; cover thy face with shame.</p>
                     <p>I remember what the Heathen <hi>Seneca</hi> writes, observing the expressions of Gods love to man in his common Providence; <hi>Verum est, usque in delicias amamur,</hi> that is, it is a very truth, we are beloved of God even as his darlings.</p>

Comfort your selves in Gods love towards You, under all the hatred and envy of men, and the contradiction of sinners that You meet with. Be strong and of a good courage, God is for You. Be assured that he that walketh uprightly, walketh surely: Forsake not the assembling of your selves together. Now see that You speak often to one another, and build up each other in the holy Faith. God knows I cannot do for you, as I would; I would have been larger to You, but I cannot. My most dear Loves I desire You to share among you. I am greatly Yours.

                     <p>YOu are a great Joy to me. I know not what thanks to render to the Lord for you, when I hear of your Constancy, and Pidelity, and Zeal, in adhering to him, and his Ways, even in such a time as this, you are highly favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Blessed be the Lord God of <hi>Israel,</hi> that he hath regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the low Estates of his Servants: That he should ever Indulge you as he hath, and Hover over you, even as the Eagle stirreth up her Nest, and fluttereth over her Young, spreadeth abroad her Wings, taketh them, beareth them on her Wings, for so hath the Lord your God dealt with You: He hath kept you as the Apple of his Eye, and since the Streams of <hi>Cherith</hi> were dried up, yet to this day he hath not suffered the handful of Meal to wast, nor the Oyl in the Cruse to fail, but (though you have no certainty to trust to) hath continually provided for you to the full. How should I love and bless the Lord for this his great Grace to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you, while I live! Now I beseech you my Brethren, that you consider the Kindness of the Lord; for the Lord your God is he that careth for you, and that you love the Lord your God, and fear him for ever, for he is your Life, and the Length of your Daies. And as <hi>Job</hi> had a holy fear of his Children, least they should have offended: So my most dearly Beloved, I am jealous of you with a Godly jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie, lest any of you should receive this Grace of God in vain. I must not cease to put you in mind, that God doth look for no small matters from You. Remember my most
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:65560:106"/>
endeared Charge, that the Lord doth look for singular things from you, that there be not a barren Tree, nor a Dwarf Christian among you; where the Lord doth strow much, he looks to gather much; and where he soweth much, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects to reap accordingly. Whose account my Beloved, is like to be so great as yours? O look about you, and think of the Master coming to Reckon with you for his Talents; when he will expect no small increase. Beloved, what can you do? How much are you grown? What spoil have you made upon your Corruptions? What progress in Grace?</p>
                     <p>Suppose Christ should put that awakening Question to you, What do you more than others? Beloved, God doth expect more of his People, than of any others in the World besides: And well he may. For</p>
                     <p>First, <hi>He hath bestowed more on them than on others:</hi> Now where much is given, much shall be required; Can you think of that without trembling? He hath bestowed on them singular Love more than on others; <hi>You only have I known of all the Families on Earth.</hi> He hath a distinguishing Love and Favour for his People, and he looks that his Love should be a constraining Argument to Obedience. Again he hath laid out a singular care on his People, more than on others: He cares for no man, for nothing in all the World, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of them. He reproveth Kings for their sakes. He will give Nations, and Kingdomes for their Ransome. So precious are they in his sight, and so dearly Beloved, that he will give men for them, and People for their Life. He withdraweth not his Eyes from the Righteous, he will not indure them out of his sight. The Eyes of the Lord are upon the Righteous, and first the Eye of his more accurate Observation: God can wink at others as it were, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look what they do with little notice, but he hath a most cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious eye upon his People, he marketh their steps, and booketh their words, he weigheth their Actions, and pondereth all their goings. And should not they walk more cautiously, and charily, than any alive, that are under so exact and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious an Eye? Secondly the Eye of special Care, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. Behold the Eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him. I will guide thee with mine Eye: And should not they be infinitely tender and careful how to please the Lord,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:65560:106"/>
who have his singular Care laid out on them? In short, God hath bestowed on them singular Priviledges more than others: These are a peculiar Treasure to him above all Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, a Kingdome of Priests, an Holy Nation, a singular sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated People, they dwell alone, they are diverse from all People: When the whole World lies in wickedness, these are Called and Chosen, and Faithful, Washed and justified, and Sanctified in the Name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God. The rest are the Refuse: These the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els: These are taken, and they are left. Shall not Gods Priests be Cloathed with Righteousness, and shall not Princes Live above the rate of Peasants?</p>
                     <p>Secondly. <hi>He hath intrusted them with more than others:</hi> Not onely with the Talents of his Grace (for the increase whereof they must give a strict account) but also with the Jewel of his Glory. How tenderly should they walk, that are entrusted with such a Jewel? Remember, your Makers Glory is bound up in your fruitful walking.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>He hath qualified them more than others.</hi> He hath put into them a Principle of Life, having quickned them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with Christ. He hath set up a Light in their Minds, when others lie in Darkness. He hath given them other Aids, than others have, even his Spirit to help their Infirmities, when others lie like Vessels that are Windbound, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not stir.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>He hath provided for them other manner of things than for others.</hi> These are the little Flock to whom it is his good pleasure to give the Kingdom; great are the preparations for them. The Father hath prepared the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome for them from the Foundations of the World: The Son is gone to Heaven on purpose to prepare a place for them: The Spirit is preparing them, and making them meet to be partakers of the Inheritance of the Saints in Light: And should these be like other People?</p>
                     <p>Brethren beloved, God and Men do expect you should do more than others, see that that you be indeed singular. For</p>
                     <p n="1">1. If you do no more for God than others, he will do more against you then others: <hi>You onely have I known, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will I punish you.</hi> The barren Tree in the Vineyard must down, whereas had he been in the Common he might have
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:65560:107"/>
stood much longer. God looked for Grapes from his Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, on which he had bestowed such Care and Cost more than ordinary, but when they bring forth wild Grapes, he will lay them waste in a worse manner than the Forrest. When Christ came to the Figg-tree seeking Fruit, and met with none, he Curst it from the Root, whereas had it been a Thorn or Bramble, it might have stood as before.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If you do no more than others, you must look for no more than others: If you should put off God with a common Obedience, you must expect to be put off with common Mercies.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Except you do more than others, God will be disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured more by you than others.</p>
                     <p>I have been too long with you, but I am earnestly desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous you should be sensible of Gods extraordinary Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from you. And truly, as God looks for more from his own than others, so he looks for more from you than others, even of his own, because that he hath done more: See that you be shining Christians, that you be strong in the Grace of God; that you press toward the Mark. But I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude; I give my Loves among you all, being able to add no more, but that I am</p>

                     <p>THe reason why my Letters have not of late come so thick as formerly to you, is not because I forget to love you, and to care for you; but because I have been busily taken up in other Labors of sundry kinds for you. I am yours, and love to be so, being ambitious not to have dominion over your faith, but to be a helper of your Joy. Christs Officers are so your Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers in the Lord, as yet to Preach not themselves, but the Lord Jesus Christ, and themselves your Servants for Jesus sake. I have no greater felicity under God, than to serve the good of Souls. Brethren beloved, How fares it with your Souls? Are they in Health? Do they prosper? I wish your Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral prosperity. It is a joy to me to hear when your Trade doth flourish: But these are but very little things if we look into Eternity. Brethren, my ambition for you is, that you should be Cedars among the Shrubs, that from you should found out the Word of the Lord, and that in every place your Faith to God-ward should be spread abroad. That <hi>Taunton</hi> should be as a Field that the Lord hath blessed: That you should not onely have the Name, but the Spirit, Life, Power, Heat, Growth, Vigour of Christianity among you. Let not <hi>Taunton</hi> onely have the Name to live, and be noted for the Profession of Religion, but see to it my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that the Kingdom of God be with you: Oh that every one of your Souls might be a Temple of God! Oh that every one of your Families might be a Church of God! Beloved,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:65560:108"/>
look to it, that every one that nameth the Name of Christ among You do depart from Iniquity, secret as well as open, of the Heart as well as of the Life. Let no man think that to make an out-cry upon the <hi>Wickedness of the Times,</hi> and to be of the <hi>Professing Party;</hi> will serve his turn; many go to Hell in the company of the wise Virgins. That no man may be a <hi>Self-deceiver,</hi> let every man be a <hi>Self-Searcher.</hi> He that keeps no Day-Book in his Shop, and no Account, no Record in his Conscience, his Estate and his Soul will thrive both alike. Beloved, I would that You should remember whither You are a going. If a man be after a few Months to be Transported into another Countrey, never to Return more, he will send over whatever he can, and make the best Provision that he may against he comes into another Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. Dear Brethren, You are Strangers and Pilgrims here, and have but a few Months abode in this Countrey, see that you Traffique much with Heaven. Christ is our Common Factor, O send over to him what possible you can. Give Alms plentifully, Pray continually, be much in Meditation and Consideration; Reckon with your selves daily: Walk with God in Your Callings: Do all the Duties of your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations as unto God: Live not one day to your selves, but unto Christ: Set forth continually in his Name, so shall you be continually Transporting into another World, and laying up Treasure in Heaven: And O the blessed Store that You shall find there after a few Years diligence in such a holy Course! Beloved, while You are here in this World, You are but like a Merchants Ship in a strange Port, the day for your Return is set, and You are to stay no longer then till your Fraight is ready. Be wise, know your season, improve your time, You are made or mar'd for ever, as You speed in this one Voyage. There is no returning again to this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey to mend a bad Market, God will call in all his Talents, Time shall be no longer. Oh? come in, come and buy now while the Market is open, that You that want may have Grace, and You that have may have it more abundantly. Go and plead with the Lord Jesus, that he hath bid You <hi>come, buy and eat</hi> without Mony, and without Price; that he hath counselled You to come buy of him Gold, Raiment, and Eye-salve; tell Him You are come according to his call, and wait upon him
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:65560:108"/>
for Grace; for Righteousness, for Light and Instruction: Lay hold on his Word, plead it, live upon it; he is worthy to be Believed, worthy to be Trusted, go out of your selves to him, unlearn your selves. There is a threefoold Foot that Carnal-self stands upon, our own <hi>Wisdome,</hi> our own <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,</hi> our own <hi>Strength,</hi> these three Feet must be Cut off, and we must learn to have no subsistence in our selves but only in Christ, and to stand only on his bottom. Study the excellent Lesson of Self-denial, Self-annihilation, A true Christian is like a Vine that cannot stand of it self, but is wholly supported by the Prop it leans on. It is no small thing to know our selves to be nothing, of no might, of no worth, of no understanding, nor reality; to look upon our selves as helpless, worthless, foolish empty shadows. This holy Littleness is a great matter; when we find that all our Inventory amounts to nothing but Folly, Weakness, and Beggery; when we set down our Selves for Cyphers, our Gain for loss, our Excellencies for very Vanities, then we shall learn to live like Believers. A true Saint is like a Glass without a Foot, that set him where you will, is ready to fall every way till you set him to a Prop: Let Christ be the only Support you lean unto. When you are throughly Emptied and Nullified, and see all comeliness to be but as a withered Flower, dead, dried, and past Recovery, then You will be put upon the happy necessity of going out to Christ for all.</p>

                     <p>I Know not what thanks to render to you, nor to God for You, for all the unexpressable love which I have found in you toward me; and not terminatively to me, but to Christ in me; for I believe it is for his sake, as I am a Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger and Embassador of his to You, that you have loved me and done so much every way for me; and I think I may say of <hi>Taunton</hi> as the Psalmist of <hi>Jerusalem, If I forget thee, let my right hand forget her cunning, if I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth.</hi> I would not, my dear Brethren, that You should be dejected or discouraged at the Late disappointments: For through the goodness of God I am not, but rather more satisfied than before: and this I can truly say, nothing doth sadden me more than to see so much sadness in your faces. As on the contrary nothing doth comfort me so much, as to see your Chear and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage. Therefore I beseech you, Brethren, faint not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of my Tribulation, nor of Gods delays, but streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the hands, and the feeble knees. And the Lord bolster up your hands, as they did the hands of <hi>Moses,</hi> that they may not fall down till <hi>Israel</hi> do prevail. Let us fear lest there be some evil among us, that God being angry with us, doth send this farther tryal upon us. Pray earnestly for me lest the eye of the most jealous God should discern that in me which should render me unfit for the mercy You desire. And let every one of you search his heart, and search his house to

Let us humble our selves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the mighty hand of God, and he shall exalt us in due time. And for the Enemies of God, you must know also that their foot shall slide in due time. Let the Servants of God encourage themselves in their God: for in the things wherein they deal proudly, he is above them: Therefore fret not your selves because of evil-doers; commit your Cause to him that judgeth righteously. Remember that you are bid if you see oppression of the poor, and violent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting of Judgment and Justice in a Province, not to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel at the matter: Verily, there is a God that Judgeth in the Earth: And you have the liberty of Appeals: Rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for him, and fret not your selves, because of the men that bring wicked devises to pass: take heed that none of you do with <hi>Peter</hi> begin to sink, now you see the waters rough, and the winds boysterous: these things must not weaken your Faith, nor cool your Zeal: for they are great Arguments for the strengthning of it. What clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer evidence can there be for the future Judgment and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the ungodly, and Coronation of the Just in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther life, than the most unjust proceedings that are here upon Earth: Shall not the Judge of all the Earth see right to be done? We see here nothing but confusion and disorder, the wicked receiveth according to the work of the Righteous, and the Innocent according to the work of the Wicked. The Godly perish and the Wicked flourish; these do prosper, and they do suffer. What! Can it be ever thus! No doubtless, there must be a day when God will Judg the World in Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, and rectifie the present disorders, and reverse the unrighteous Sentences that have been passed against his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. And this evidence is so clear, that many of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Philosophers have from this very Argument (I mean the unrighteous usage of the Good) concluded that there must certainly be Rewards and Punishments adjudged by God in mother World.</p>

Where else should you bestow your Loves? Love ye the Lord, ye his Saints, and cling about him the faster now ye see the World is stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to separate you from him. How many are they that go to knock off your fingers! O methinks, I see what tug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging there is. The World is plucking, and the Devil is plucking: Oh, hold fast, I beseech you; hold fast, that no man take your Crown. Let the Water that is sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, yea, rather poured upon your Love, make it to flame up the more. Are you not betrothed unto Christ? Oh Remember, Remember your Marriage-Covenant: Did you not take him for Richer for Poorer, for better for worse: Now prove your love to Christ to have been a true Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal love, in that you can love him when most slighted, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised, undervalued, blasphemed among men. Now acquit your selves, not to have followed Christ for the Loaves, Now confute the Accuser of the Brethren, who may be ready to suggest of the best of You, as he did of <hi>Job, Doth he serve the Lord for nought?</hi> And let it be seen that You loved Christ and Holiness purely for their own sakes, that You can love a naked Christ when there is no hopes of worldly advantage, or promoting of self-interest in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing him.</p>
                     <p>Yet beware that none of you do stick to the wayes of Christ and Religion upon so carnal an Account as this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this is the Way that you have <hi>already taken up,</hi> and you count it a <hi>shame</hi> to recede from <hi>your Principles:</hi> I am very jealous lest some Professors should miss of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for this: Least they should be accounted Turn-coats and Hypocrites; therefore they will shew a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>MY continual Solicitude for your State, will not suffer me to pass in quiet one week without Writing to you, unless I am extraordinarily hindred. Your Sincerity, Sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastness, and Proficiency in the Grace of God, is the matter of my earnest desire, and that which I should account my self happy in. I have a longing desire to see the Faces of you all, and (besides mine Expectation) shall (I trust) spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily have the opportunity to see you at the approaching As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sizes, which I shall greatly rejoice in, notwithstanding our coming may be otherwise attended with many Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies. In the mean time I send you a few Prison Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels. As,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>To improve for Eternity the Advantages of your present State.</hi> Though you are at many disadvantages with respect to the publick Ordinances, yet you have many wondrous and most happy Priviledges, which Spiritual Wisdom would make no small improvement of. Oh what a Mercy have you that you may serve God while you will in your Families! That you may be as much as you will with God in secret Prayer, and holy Meditation, and Self-examination! I beseech You consider what a Blessing You have above others, that have your Health, and a Competency of the Comforts of this Life, and are free from those continual pains, or Heart-eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cares, that others are disabled by, from looking after
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:65560:111"/>
God and their Souls, as You may do. Oh consider what a blessed Seed-time You have for Eternity! Now be wise and improve your happy Season, your day of Grace. Prepare for Death, make all sure: Press on towards the Mark, lay up in store for your selves a good Foundation against the time to come. In the Morning sow your Seed, and in the Evening withdraw not your Hand. Treasure up much in Heaven: What profit is it that you have more than others? more Liberty, more Comfort, more Health, more Wealth, than others? except You love God more, and serve him better than others. Now ply your Work, and dispatch your Business, so as that you may have nothing to trouble You upon your Death-Beds.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>To Consider also the Temptations, and Disadvantages of your State.</hi> Study to know your own weaknesses, and where your danger lies, that you may obviate Satan, and prevent your Miscarrying: There is no Condition but hath its Snares. See that You acquaint your selves with his Devices, least You be beguiled by him, and caught in his Trap through your own unwariness. You that are well provided for in the World, had need to watch your selves, least You fall in love with present things, least you be lifted up, least You trust in those Carnal props, and put confidence in the Creatures, least You warp, and decline, and baulk your duties through Carnal fear, and the desire of preserving your Estates. You that have little in the World, are not without your tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions neither: Oh take heed of envying others prosperity, of murmurring and discontent, of diffidence and distrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, of using indirect means to help your selves: Be sure You make not the Worlds pressures upon you, an excuse from your daily serving of God in your Families, and in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret. Set this down as your Rule, and unchangeeble Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, that God and your Souls and your Families shall be looked duly and continually after, go the world which way it will. Consider what sins your Tempers, Relations, Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, do most expose you to. Be not strangers to your selves. Prove your selves upright in keeping from your Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities.</p>

These are your poor Kindred that you must shortly dwell with, when you come to your long Home: Remember the days of Darkness which shall be many. Take every day some serious turns with Death. Think where you shall be a few days and nights hence, happy he that knew what to morrow meant for 20. Years together. Believe it, you will find it no little thing to die. Think often how you are provided, how you should receive the Sentence of Death. Were you never within sight of Death? How did it look? What did you wish for most at that time? What did then trouble you most? Oh mark those things, and live accordingly. Often ask your Hearts, What if God should this night require my Soul?</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>To serve your Generation with your might while you have time.</hi> You have but a very little time to bring God any Glory here, or to do your Friends any good; now up and be doing. Now or never live in the deep and and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant sense of the very little time that You have for this World, and the great work You have to do. You are going whence You shall not return. There's no After-Game to be Plaid. What! But one cast for Eternity, and will You not be carefull to throw that well?</p>
                     <p>Most dearly Beloved, I covet after your furtherance in Mortification, and Growth in Grace. And Oh that I could but represent Death to You, as shortly it will shew it self: Or could but open a Window into Eternity to You: How effectually would this do the work. Then the Cripple would fling away his Crutches, and betake him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to his Leggs: Then the Slothful would pluck his Hand out of his Bosome, and shake off his Excuses, and be Night and Day at his work. Then the <hi>Laodicean</hi> would be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from his benumed frame; then we should have no Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in Religion, no Lazy wishing and complaining; but men would ply the Oars to purpose, and sweat at their work.</p>

                     <p>ALthough I am forced at the present, to be at a distance from You; yet I would not have you ignorant, that the dear remembrance of you is always fresh with me, and the care of your eternal Welfare is always living upon my heart. Therefore as my Beloved Friends I warn you, and cease not to stir you up by way of remembrance, being jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for you with a Godly jealousie, that no man take your Crown. My dearly Beloved, I know you have many Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and above all, I fear your bosom Enemies: and as the Watchman of the Lord, I give you careful warning, and exhort you all not to be high-minded, but fear. Blessed is the man that feareth always. Look diligently, lest any of you fail of the Grace of God. You have made much and long Profession of the Name of Jesus Christ: Oh, look to your Foundations, see upon what Ground you stand. Look to your sincerity. You must every one of you stand shortly before the Judgment Seat of Christ, and be tried for your lives: Oh, try your selves throughly first. 'Tis easie to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake Education for Regeneration, and common Conviction and Illumination for Conversion, and a partial Reformation and external Obedience, for true Sanctification. Therefore I beseech you every one, to examine whether you are in the Faith. Prove your own selves. Tell not me, you hope you are sincere, you hope you shall go to Heaven: Never put it off with Hopes, but pray, and try, and search, till you are able to say, yea, and know you are passed from Death to Life, and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:65560:113"/>
that you know you have a Building, not made with hands, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal in the Heavens.</p>
                     <p>Suppose I should ask you one by one, Where are your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences for Heaven? Could you make out your Claim? Can you bring me Scripture-proof? Can you shew me the Marks of the Lord Jesus? What mean you to live at Uncertainties? Brethren, it is an intollerable Ignorance for any of you in these dayes of glorious Light, not to be able to tell the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishing Marks of a sound Believer. And it is intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble carelesness of your everlasting Welfare, if you do not bring your selves to the Trial by these Marks. What are your hands filled with Books, and your ears filled with Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, that tell you so plainly from the word of God, how you shall know whether you are in Christ, and are you still to seek? Oh, stir up your own selves. Take heed, lest a Promise being left of entring into his Rest, any of you fall short of it at last by Vnbelief. You are a Professing Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, you pray, and you hear, and you run upon some Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures for Jesus Christ: But, O look to your sincerity. Look to your Principles, look to your Ends, else you may lose all at last. Examine, not onely what is done, but whence 'tis done, look to the Root, as well as to the Fruit. Eye, not onely your Actions, but your Aims. Remember what a strict and severe Eye you are under. The Lord Jesus makes strict observation upon all your works and wayes. He observes who of you be fruitful, and who be barren and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable. He knows who of you be thriving and who be declining. He observes, who be warm, and who lukewarm: who be sound Christians, and who of you have onely a name to live.</p>
                     <p>Return, O backsliding Christians: You have lost your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Convictions, and lost your former Affections. You are grown remiss in your watch, and your Zeal is turned into a kind of indifferencie, and your diligence into negligence. Your Care is turned into Security, and your tenderness into senslessness. Oh, your case is dangerous. The Lord Jesus hath a great Controversie with you. Oh, remember whence
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:65560:114"/>
you are fallen, and repent, and do your first works. Streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the things that remain, and are ready to die. Oh, rub and chafe your swooning Souls, and ply them with warm ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, and rousing considerations, till they recover their former heat. And know ye from the Lord, that the backsli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in heart shall be filled with his own wayes.</p>
                     <p>O ye barren and fruitless trees: Behold the Axe is lifted up to fell you to the ground, except you bring forth fruits, and those worthy of Repentance. May not Christ say to some among you, <hi>Behold these three years have I come, seeking fruit, and finding none?</hi> How is it then that you read not the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence passed on the fruitless Tree? O sleepy Professors, how long will you drive on in this heavy course? How long will you continue in an unprofitable and customary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession? Would you be the joy of our Lord, why know ye, that the thriving Plant is the Masters praise, and his hearts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. Christians, put on, press towards the Mark, be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your Faith, Virtue; and to Virtue, Knowledge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> See that you grow extensively, in being abundant in all forts of good works. Be pitiful, be courteous, gentle, easily to be entreated. Be slow to anger, soon reconciled. Be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, be ye temperate, be ye chearful. Study not every one onely his own things, but the good of his Neighbor. Think it not enough to look to your own Souls, but watch for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Souls. Pray for them, warn them, be kind to them, study to oblige them, that by any means you may win them, and gain their Souls.</p>
                     <p>Labour to grow intensively, to do better the things that you did before, to be more fervent in Prayer, more free and willing in all the ways of the Lord, to hear with more profit, to examine your selves more thorowly, to mind Heaven more frequently than heretofore.</p>
                     <p>And you, O carnal and unsound Professors, that reckon your selves to be in Christ, but are not new Creatures; that because you have the good opinion of the Godly, and are outwardly conformable to the wayes of God, perswade your selves
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:65560:114"/>
you are in a good condition, although your hearts have not yet to this day been renewed: O Repent speedily. Repent, and be converted. What though we cannot distinguish the Tares from the Wheat? Yet the Lord of the Harvest can. Christ will find you out, and condemn you for rotten and unsound, unless you be soundly renewed by repentance, and effectually changed by converting Grace.</p>
                     <p>Brethren, I fervently wish your Salvation, and to this, while I am able, I shall bend my ardent endeavours, I am now taking advice for my health, and hope in some few Weeks to be restored to you. In the mean time I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend me to Your Prayers, and you to the Grace of God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining.</p>

                     <p>In a word, If you will be put out of doubt whether you are his Sheep or not, you must trie it by this certain Mark that Christ sets upon all his Sheep, even your <hi>Sanctification,</hi> you that will stand to the trial, answer me truly and deliberately to these Questions. Do you hate every sin as the Sheep doth the Mire? Do you regard no Iniquity in your Hearts? Do you strive against, and oppose all Sin, though it may seem never so necessary, never so natural to you, or have you not you secret Haunts of evil? For every Swine will have his swill. Do you abstain from sin out of fear, or out of dislike? Are You at peace with no sin, or do you not hide some Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity as a sweet morsel under your Tongue? Is there not some practice that You are not willing to know is a sin for fear you should be forced to leave it? Do you love the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment that forbids your sin, or do you not wish it out of the Bible, as that evil man wished God had never made the Seventh Commandment? Again, how do You stand af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected towards Holiness? Do you love it? Do you choose it? Do You hunger and thirst after it, and desire it more than any Temporal good? Have You chosen the way of Gods Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, and had rather live Holily than be allowed to live in your sins? Do You in your very Hearts, prefer a Godly strict Life in communion with and conformity to God, before the greatest prosperity of the World? Do You chose Holiness, not out of bare necessity, because You cannot go to Heaven without it, but out of <hi>love</hi> to it, and from a deep sense that You have of the surpassing Excellency, and Loveliness, and Beauty of it? If it be thus with You, You are the Persons that the Lord Jesus hath marked for his Sheep.</p>
                     <p>And now, Come ye Blessed, all that have this Mark upon You, come and understand your happiness; You are mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out for preservation, and let it go how it will with the

rest; this I know, it shall go well with you that fear the Lord, that fear before him. You are the separated Ones, the seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Ones, Upon whom the Angel hath set the Seal of the Living God; and so you are redeemed unto God from among men, being the First-fruits unto God, and unto the Lamb, and have your Fathers Name written in your Fore-heads.</p>
                     <p>Hear, O beloved Flock, I may give you the Salutation of the Angels, <hi>Hail, You are highly favoured of the Lord, Blessed are you among men;</hi> though you are but poor and despised, and like little <hi>Benjamin</hi> among the thousands of <hi>Judah;</hi> You carry away the the Blessing and the Priviledge from all the rest. God hath done more for the least of you than for the whole World of Mankind besides, put all their mercies together. <hi>Fear not little Flock, it is your Fathers good pleasure to give you the Kingdom. Blessed are you of the Lord for yours is the Kingdome of Heaven.</hi> All that the Scripture speaks of that Kingdome of Glory, that Kingdome of Peace, of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that Everlasting Kingdome, It speaks it all to you. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold your Inheritance, See that you believe. What know you not your own selves? You are the Sons of God, Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritours of the Kingdom of Heaven, Joint Heirs with Christ the Lord of Glory. Do you believe this? Take heed you make not God a Lyar: His Word is nigh you: Have you not the Writings in your hands? Do I speak any thing but what God hath spoken? Shall I tell you of the thing which shall be hereafter? Why thus it shall be. The Son of man shall come in his Glory, and all his holy Angels with him: Then shall he sit upon the Throne of his Glory, and he shall se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate you as a Shepherd divideth the Sheep from the Goats, and he shall set you at his own right hand, Then shall the King say, <hi>Come ye Blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdome prepared for you.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Do you believe yet? Do you throughly believe? If so, then my work is done, then I need not bid you <hi>Rejoyce,</hi> nor bid you be <hi>Thankful,</hi> onely <hi>believe.</hi> Do this and do all <hi>Believe</hi> and you <hi>will rejoyce</hi> with Joy unspeakeable, and full of Glory. <hi>Believe</hi> and you will be <hi>Fruitfull,</hi> and shew your Faith by your works. <hi>Believe</hi> and you will <hi>Love,</hi> for Faith

worketh by love. In a word, keep these things upon your Hearts by daily and lively Consideration, and this will bring Heaven into your Souls, and ingage you to all manner of holy Conversation, and Godliness. This will mortifie you to the World, the grand Enemy which I advise, nay, I charge you to beware of. When <hi>Saul</hi> had gotten his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, he left off taking Care for the Asses. O Remember yours is the Kingdom: What are You the better that You have all this in your Bibles, if you do not weigh it by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and serious Consideration, and ponder these sayings in your Hearts. Beloved, I have written these things to <hi>you</hi> that your joy may be full. And now Peace I leave with <hi>you,</hi> I am Christs Embassador to you, an Embassador of Peace; his Peace I pronounce unto you: In his Name I bless you. Farewell in the Lord, I am</p>

Methings there is somethink still to do, and my Weeks work is not ended, unless I have given my Soul vent, and imparted something to the Beloved flock that I have left behind. And Oh, that my Letters in my ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence might be useful to you! Assuredly it is my joy to serve You, and my Love to you is without dissimulation: witness my twice lost Liberties, and my impaired Health, all which I might have preserved, had it not been for my readiness to minister to you.</p>
                     <p>But what do I speak of my Love? It is the Sense of the infinite Love of God your Father that I would have to dwell upon you. Forget me, so you remember him. Let me be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little, so he be very lovely in your Eyes. Let him be as the Bucket that goes up, though I be as the Bucket that goes down.

                     <p>Brethren, understand mine Office, I Preach not my self,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:65560:119"/>
but the Lord Jesus Christ, and my self your Servant for Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus sake. Give him your hearts, and I have my Errand. I am but the Friend of the Bridegroom, and my Business is, but to give you to understand his Love, and to gain your hearts unto him. He is an Object worthy of my Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, and of your affections. His Love is worth the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of, and worth the thinking of, and worth the speaking of. O my Brethren, never forget, I beseech you, how he loveth You. He is in heaven, and You are on earth; he is in Glory and you in Rags; he is in the shining Throne, and you in dirty Flesh, and yet he loveth you. His heart is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely tender of you, even now while he is at the right hand of the Majesty on High. How feelingly doth he cry out at the hurt of his poor Members on Earth? <hi>Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me!</hi> Oh, of what quick Sense is the Sense of our dear Lord unto us! when we are touched on Earth he feels it in Heaven.</p>
                     <p>Brethren, Christ is real in all that he speaks unto you: He is not like a flourishing Lover, who fills up his Letters with Rhetorick, and hath more care of the dress of his Speech, than of the Truth. Who ever gave Demonstration of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allity of his Love at so dear a rate as Christ hath done? Men do not use to die in jest: Who will impoverish himself to enrich his Friend? and divest himself of his honour to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance him? and debase himself to admiration below his own degree to contract affinity with him? and all this but to make him believe that he loves him.</p>
                     <p>Brethren, possess your very hearts with this, that Christs love doth go out with infinite dearness towards you. Even now while he is in all his Glory, he earnestly remembers you still. This is the High Priest that now is entred into the Holy of Holies, doth bear your names particularly, remembring every poor believer by name. He bears your names, but where? upon his Brest-plate, upon his Heart, saith the Text, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. 29. Ah Christians, I may salute you as the Angel did <hi>Mary, Hail you that are highly favoured: Blessed are you among men.</hi> Sure your Lot is fallen in an happy
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:65560:119"/>
place; What in the Bosom of Christ? yea, and verily you may believe, and doubt not. I may apply that of <hi>Gabriel, O Daniel, thou art greatly beloved,</hi> unto you; you are beloved indeed, to have your Names written upon the very heart of Christ now he is in Glory.</p>
                     <p>Oh, let his <hi>Name</hi> be written then on <hi>your</hi> hearts. Do not write his Name in the Sand, when he hath written yours up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his <hi>own Brest!</hi> Do not forget him who hath taken such care, that while he is, he may never forget you, having record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your Names not onely on his <hi>Book,</hi> but on his <hi>Flesh,</hi> and set you as a Seal upon his Heart. He hath you upon his heart, but why? For a memorial before the Lord continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, so saith the Text. Beloved, your Lord is so far from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting you in all his Greatness and Glory, that he is gone into heaven on purpose, there to present you before the Lord, that you may be alwaies in remembrance before him. O Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, Glory, yea, and Triumph in his Love. Doubtless it must go well with us. Who shall condemn? It is Christ that died, and rose again, and is now making Intercession. His Interest is potent. He is alwaies present. Our Advocate is never out of Court. Never did Cause miscarry in his hand. Trust you safely in him. Happy is that man for whom he shall undertake to speak.</p>
                     <p>Oh, the Riches of Christs Love! He did not think it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to die for You. His Love and care doth not end with his natural Life on Earth, but he ever liveth to make Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession for us. His Love is like his Life, ever, ever: Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no remission in degree, nor intermission of time, no ces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of working, but is ever, ever, in motion towards us.</p>
                     <p>But when shall I end, if I suffer my Soul to run out its length, and my running Pen to enlarge according to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensions of this boundless Field of Divine Love? If the Pens of all the World were imployed to write Volumes of Love, if the Tongues of all the living were exercised in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but talking of this love; If all the Hearts that
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:65560:120"/>
be were made up of Love; and all the Powers and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the mind were turned into one, to wit the power of Love, yet this were no less than infinitely too little, either to conceive, or to express the greatness of Christs Love.</p>
                     <p>O my dearly Beloved, may your Souls be swallowed up in this Love. Think, and think while you will, you can never think how much You are beloved. See that ye love again by way of <hi>Gratitude,</hi> though not of <hi>Requital:</hi> What though your Souls be but narrow, and your powers but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, yet love him with all you have. Love him with all your hearts, and all your strength. To the Meditations, and to the Embraces of Divine Love I leave you, thinking it now not worth while to tell You of my Love, Remaining</p>

But as my Lot in him is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, so I will assure You, it is no small content to me, that my Lot is fallen with You. And though many difficulties have fallen to my Lot among You (for I have broken my health and lost my Liberty once and again, for Your sakes) yet none of these things move me. I wish nothing more then to spend and to be spent upon the service of your Faith. I bless the Lord for it as an invaluable Mercy, that ever he called me to be an Embassadour of the Lord Jesus Christ to You-wards. In this station I desire to approve my self to
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:65560:121"/>
him, and that I am withdrawn from my Work for a season, it is but that I may return to you refreshed, and inabled for my Work among You. You may not think that I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten You, and consulted my own ease and pleasure: but if God prosper my Intentions, I shall be found to have been daily serving You in this Retirement. I will assure You, I am very tender of preserving all that little strength that God doth add to me entirely for Your sakes: being resolved not so much as once to broach the Vessel till I draw forth to You. I bless the Lord, I am in great tranquility here in this Town, and walk up and down the Corporation without any Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning me. Onely it hath pleased the Lord to add to my Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction since my coming, by taking away my dear Father, the day of whose glorious Translation was the day after my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving here. But I bless the Lord, I do believe and expect the return of the Redeemer with all his Saints, and the most glorious Resurrection of my own dead Body with all Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers: and this makes me to rest in Hope, and fills me with unspeakable more Joy than the death of my self or any other Saint can with grief. And now I make it my business to be rendred serviceable to you; and do by this, return You my hearty thanks for your earnest Prayers and Intercessiors to God in my behalf, for it is he that must do the Cure: I seem to my self to be ritired to this place, as a Vessel rent and shatter'd and torn in the Service, that is come to recruit in the <hi>Harbour:</hi> And here I am as it were rigging, and repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Victualling to put forth again in the Service: which I shall do with the first Wind, as soon as I am ready. What is my life unless I am serviceable? And though I must for the present forbear my wonted Labour, yet I shall not cease to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort You, and call upon you while I am absent from You, to stand fast, and to grow up in your holy Faith.</p>
                     <p>Be warned, my dearly Beloved, that You fall not upon these dangerous Rocks upon which so many Professors have been split.</p>
                     <p>There are three Things which I beseech you carefully to beware of.</p>
                     <p>First, <hi>Lest while Christ is in your mouths, the world run away with your hearts:</hi> There is many a seeming Professor that will be found a meer Idolater? Many a Soul goes down to
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:65560:121"/>
                        <hi>Hell</hi> in this sin, in the midst of his Profession, and never <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> it till it be too late. Remember, I beseech You, that the <hi>Oxen,</hi> the Farm, Wife, Merchandize, all of them lawful Comforts, did as effectually keep men from a sound and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving closing with Christ, as the vilest lufts of the worst of men. Whatever You find your hearts very much <hi>pleased</hi> in, and in love with, among these earthly Comforts, set a mark upon that thing, and remember that there lies your greatest danger. What you love most, you must fear most; and think often with your selves, This, if any thing, is like to be my ruine. Oh, the multitudes of Professors that perish for ever, by the secret hand of this mortal Enemy, I mean the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing of Earthly things. The hearers compared to the thorny Ground, did not openly fall away and cast off their Profession, as the stony ground did; but while others withered away, the blade of Profession was as green and fresh as ever; and yet their inordinate affection to the things of this life, did secretly undo all at last. Little do most Professors think of this, while they please themselves in their estates, while they delight themselves so freely in their Children, in their Wives, in their habitations and possessions; that <hi>these</hi> be the things that are like to undo them for ever. <hi>How</hi> little is that Scripture thought of, which speaks so dreadfully to worldly Professors; <hi>Love not the world, for if any man love the world, the love of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is not in him.</hi> Are there not many among us, who though they do keep up Prayer, and other holy Duties; yet the strength and vigour of their hearts goeth out after earthly things? And those are their chief Care and their chief Joy. Such must know, and they are none of Christs, and they were better to understand it now, and seek to be renewed by Repentance, then hereafter when there shall be no place for Repentance.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Lest while iniquity doth abound, your love to Christ doth wax cold.</hi> Remember what an Abomination <hi>Laodicoa</hi> was to Christ, because she grow so luke-warm; and what a contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie he had with <hi>Ephesus,</hi> a sound Church, because she did but slacken and grow more remiss in her love. A Friend is born for Adversity; and now is the time, if you will prove the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of your love and friendship to Jesus Christ, by following him zealously, resolvedly, fully, now he is most rejected and opposed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="106" facs="tcp:65560:122"/>Thirdly, <hi>Lest you keep up a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> and fruitless Profession, without Progression:</hi> See to it my Brethren, that You be not onely Professors, but proficients: Many Professors think all is well because they keep on in the Exercises of Religion; but alas! You may keep on Praying, and hearing all the Week long, and yet be not one jot the further. Many there are that keep going, but it is like the Horse in the Mill, that is going all day, but yet is no further than when he first began. Nay, it oft times happens in the Trade of Religion, as it doth in Trading in the World, where many keep on in Trading still, till for want of care and caution, and examining their accounts whether they go forward or backward, they Trade themselves out of all. Oh, look to it my Brethren, that none of You rest in the doing of Duties, but examine what comes of them. Otherwise as You may Trade your selves into Poverty, so you may hear and pray your selves into hardness of heart, and desperate security, and formality. This was the very Case of wretched <hi>Laodicea,</hi> who kept up the Trade of Religious Duties, and verily thought that all was well, because the Trade still went on, and that she was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased in spiritual Goods, and in a gaining way: but when her accounts were cast up at last, all comes to nothing, and ends in wretchedness, poverty, and nakedness. Most dear Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, I wish and pray for the prosperity of you all: but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, I wish your Souls prosperity, with which, after my most dear Loves to You all, having already exceeded the bounds of an Epistle, I commend You to the living God, Remaining</p>

                     </opener>
                     <p>I Love you, and long for you in the Lord, and I am weary with forbearing that good and blessed Work that the Lord hath committed to me, for the furtherance of your Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. How long Lord, how long shall I dwell in silence! How long shall my Tongue cleave to the Roof of my Mouth! When will God open my Lips, that I may stand up and praise him? But it is my Fathers good pleasure yet to keep me in a total disability of publishing his Name among you; unto him my soul shall patiently subscribe. I may not, I cannot complain that he is hard to me, or useth me with Rigour: I am full of the Mercies of the Lord, yea, Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and running over, And shall I complain? Far be it from me.</p>
                     <p>But though I may not murmur, methinks I may mourn a little, and sit down and wish, O if I may not have a Tongue to speak, would I had but Hands to Write, that I might from my Pen drop some heavenly Councels to my Beloved People. Methinks my feeble Fingers do even Itch to Write unto you, but it cannot be, alas my Right-hand seems to have forgot her cunning, and hath much ado with trembling to lift the Bread unto my Mouth. Do you think you should have had so little to shew under my Hand, to bear witness of my Care for you, and Love to you if God had not shook my Pen as it were out of my Hand? But all that he doth is done well, and wisely, and therefore I submit. I have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:65560:123"/>
to borrow Hands wherewith to Write unto my Beloved rather then to be silent any longer.</p>
                     <p>But where shall I begin, or when should I end? If I think to speak of the Mercies of God towards me, or mine enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed affections towards you, methinks I feel already how strait this Paper is like to be, and how insignificant my Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions will be found, and how insufficient all that I can say will prove at last to utter what I have to tell you; but shall I say nothing because I cannot utter all, this must not be neither.</p>
                     <p>Come then all ye that fear the Lord, come and I will tell you what he hath done for my Soul. O help me to love that precious Name of his, which is above all my Praises. O love the Lord all ye his Saints, and fear before him! mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the Lord with me, and let us exalt his Name together! he hath remembred my low estate, because his Mercy endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth for ever. O blessed be you of the Lord, my dearly Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, O thrice blessed may you be for all your Remembrances of me before the Lord, you have wrestled with the Lord for me, you have wrestled me out of the very Jaws of Death it self: O the strength of Prayer! Surely it is stronger than Death. See that You even honour the power and prevalency of Prayer: Oh be in Love with Prayer, and have high and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable thoughts of it. What Distresses, Diseases. Deaths can stand before it? Surely I live by Prayer, Prayer hath given a Resurrection to this Body of mine, when Physicians, and Friends had given up their hopes.</p>
                     <p>Ah my dearly Beloved, methinks it delights me to tell the Story of your Love, how much more of the Love of God towards me. I have not forgotten, O my dearly Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, I have not forgotten your tender Love in all my Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses. I remember your kindness to me in my Bonds, when once and again I was delivered up to a Prison for your sakes. I remember with much delight, how You refreshed and comforted me in my Tribulations, how open your hearts were, and your hands were not straightned neither, for I was in want of nothing. I may not, I must not forget what painful Journies you took to visit me, when in places Remote the hand of the Lord had touched me, and though my long Sickness was almost incredible Expensive to me, yet your
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:65560:123"/>
supplies did not a little lighten my Burthen.</p>
                     <p>And though I put it last, yet I do not mind it least, that You have been so ready in returning Praises to God in my behalf, your Thanksgiving to God, my dear Brethren, do administer abundant cause to me of my giving thanks unto You.</p>
                     <p>And now my Heart methinks is big to tell You a little of my Loue to You, surely You are dear unto me; but though it be sweet to tell the Story of Love, yet in this I will restrain my self. For I fear least as the Wise man saith of the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of strife, so I should find of the beginning of Love, that it is like the letting forth of the Water; and the rather I do forbear, because I hope you have better Testimonies than Words, to bear Witness herein unto You.</p>
                     <p>But if I sing the Song of Love, O let Divine Love overcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Praise; I found my self in straights when I began to speak of the natural Love between my dear People, and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Minister of Christ to them; and it seemed that all that I have said was much too little, but now I have to speak of the Love God, it seems to be by far too much.</p>
                     <p>O infinite Love never to be Comprehended, but ever to be Admired, Magnified, and Adored by every Creature! O let my Heart be filled, let my Mouth be filled, let my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers be filled, ever ever filled with the thankful Commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of this matchless Love. O turn your Eyes from other Objects! O Bury me in Forgetfulness, and let my Love be no more mentioned nor had in remembrance among You, so that You may be throughly possessed and inflamed with the Love of God. This, my Beloved, this is that Love which is ever to be Commended, and Extolled by You. See that You studie this Love, fill your Souls with wonder, and feast your Souls with joy, and be ravished with rich con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment in this Divine Love: Take your daily walk, and lose your selves in the Field of Love: Drink, O Friends, yea drink abundantly, O Beloyed, fear no excess. O that your Souls may be drencht and drowned in the Love of Christ, till You can every one say with the ravisht Spouse, <hi>I am sick of Love.</hi> Marvel not that I wander here, and seem to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the bounds of a Letter, this Love obligeth me, Yea, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther constraineth me. Who in all the Earth should admire
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:65560:124"/>
and commend this Love if I should not? I feel it, I taste it, the sweet Savour thereof Reviveth my Soul, it is Light to mine Eyes, and Life co mine Heart; the warm Beams of this blessed Sun, O how have they Comforted me, Ravished, and Refreshed me both in Body and Soul! My benumbed Limbs, my withered Hands, my feeble Knees, my Bones quite naked of Flesh do yet again Revive through the Quickning, Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Raising influence of Divine Grace and Love. Now my own Hands can feed me, and my own feet can bear me, my Appetlte is quick, my Sleep comfortable, and God is pleased to give some increase continually though by insensible Degrees; And shall not I praise that Love and Grace that hath done all this for me? Yea, what is this to all I have to tell You? My Heart is enlarged, but I told You Paper could not hold what I have to speak of the Goodness of the All-Gracious God, in which I live. I am forced to end, least you should not bear my length. My dearly Beloved, I send my Heart unto You, divide my Love amongst you all, and particularly tender it to your Reverend and Faithfull Pastour, whose Presence with you, and Painfulness, and Watchfulness over you, and Zeal and Courage for you in so dangerous a time, is matter of my great Joy and Thanksgivings unto God.

You will call them up, and force them to do your work; and should you not, at least be as zealous in putting them upon Gods work? Say not, they are dull and are not capable. If they be dull, God requires of you the more pains and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but so dull as they are, you will make them learn how to work; and can they not learn as well how to live! Are they capable of the mysteries of your trade, and are they not capable of the plain principles of Religion? well as ever you would see the growth of Religion, the cure of ignorance, the remedy of prophaness, the downfal of error, fulfil you my joy in going through with this duty.</p>
                     <p>I have been too long already, and yet I am afraid my let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will be ended before my work be done, how loath am I to leave you, before I have prevailed with you to set to the work, to which you are here directed, will you pass your promise, will you give me your hands?

Would you that God should build your Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and bless your Substance? would you that your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren should bless you? that Your Father should bless You?

I have given unto them the Words which thou gavest me, and they have received them. I have manifested thy Name unto them, and they have kept thy Word. And now I am no more with them, but I come unto thee: Holy Father keep them through thine own Name; for they are thine.

                     <p>I Do thankfully acknowledge, both to God, and You, that I am many ways obliged to love, and serve you: and surely, when the Lord shall turn our Captivity, I will (through his Grace) endeavour to shew my self thankful, wherein I may, unto You. I am the more sensible of your great love, because I cannot be insensible, how little I have deserved such a Mercy, and how little I have been able to do, to oblige You. Able, I say, for I am sure. I have been willing to be much more serviceable to you: But now, Letters and Prayers are all that I have for you; of these I shall be ready to be prodigal. Your love to me hath been very bountiful: I may not forget the liberal Supplies that you have sent, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of you, even out of your poverty to me; and not to me only, but to the whole Family of my Brethren, and Fellow-Prisoners, who do all bless you, and send by these with me, their thankful respects unto you. I servently pray, and do not doubt to speed, that you may reap in Grace and Glory, what you have sown to us in bounty. <hi>Verily, there is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for the Righteous.</hi> Ah, how sure is it! And how great and how near is it? Come on, my dear Brethren, and Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Travellers. Stir up your selves, and set to your race. See that you loiter not, but speed apace in your holy Course. What tire by the way, or think of looking back, when Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is the prize? God forbid. To him that soweth righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:65560:130"/>
there shall be a sure reward. What though it should seem slow? As long as it is so sure, and so great, never be discouraged: In the end you shall reap, if you faint not. Wait but a while, and you shall have a blessed Harvest. The Lord speaks to the Christian, as he to his Creditor in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Case. Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all. Oh now for Faith and Patience! How safely, how sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly would these carry us to our Home and Harbour, through all difficulties. Brethren beloved, be ye followers of them, who through Faith and Patience inherit the Promises. It is want of Patience that undoes the world. Patience, I mean, not so much in the bearing the inflicted evil, as in waiting for the deferred good. If the Reward of Religion would be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently in hand, who would not be Religious? Who but the deceitful world count it doubtful and distant; and they are all for something in hand, and so take up with a present feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. The Lord deals all upon trust, and upon that account is but little dealt with. You must have Patience, and be content to plow and sow, and wait for the return of all at the Harvest, when this life is ended. They that like not Religion upon these terms, may see where they can mend their Markets. But you, my Brethren, be stedfast, unmoveable, abounding in the work of the Lord, for as much as you know your labour shall not be in vain in the Lord. Wait a little, there is but a short life between you, and the blessed inheritance of the endless Glory. Ah wretched unbelievers! How worthy are you to be shut for ever out of the Kingdom, that did so undervalue all the Glory, that God had promised, as not to count it suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to pay them for a little waiting? Beloved, lift up your Eyes and behold your Inheritance, the good Land that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the <hi>Jordan,</hi> and that goodly Mountain. The Promises are a Map of Heaven. Do but view it believingly and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately, as it is darkly drawn there, and tell me, what think you of that worthy portion, that goodly Heritage?

Behold the Husbandman waiteth for the precious fruits of the Earth, and hath long patience, till he receive the early and later rain. Be ye also patient, stablish your hearts, for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh. What, shall the Husbandman have more patience for the Fruits of the Earth, than you for the pretious fruits of your Faith?

                        </gap>, he is content to venture. He is at great pains, and much cost, he is still laying out, and hath nothing coming in, and yet he is content to wait for his reimbursement, till the Corn be grown. But your harvest is must sure, as sure as the irrevocable Decree, the infallible Promise, the immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Oath of a God, a God that cannot lie, that knows no place for Repentance, can make it. Again, the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man hath no such increase to look for as you. Oh, if he were but sure, that every Corn would bear a Crown, with what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ultation and joy, rather than patience, would he go through all his cost and labour. Why, Brethren, such is a Believers increase. Every Grain shall produce a Crown, and every Tear shall bring forth a Pearl; and every minute in pains or Prayers, an age of Joy and Glory. Besides, the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man hath long patience, and will not you have a little pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? It is not long patience that God doth expect of you: for behold, the coming of the Lord draweth nigh. Will the Garrison yield when relief is at hand? Or the Merchant sit down and give up his hopes, when within sight of the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour? Or will the Husbandman <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>, and give up all for lost, when he sees the fields even white for the Harvest? Or shall he do more for a crop of Corn, than you will do for a crop of Glory? Far be it. Behold the Judge is even at Door. The Lord is at hand. He cometh quickly, and his reward is with him. He comes with the Crown in his hand, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

The Prisoners of the Lord, your Brethren in the Patience of Jesus, can tell you, it is good suffering for such a Master. We must tell you, as they said to our Lord in another case, He

                     <p>HAving taken up a Resolution to Write to, and to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to confirm all the Places, where I have gone up and down Preaching the Kingdom of God, You were by no means to be omitted. You were the People that were last upon my Heart, before my taking up, and had I not been made a Prisoner, I think I had in a few hours after the time of my Apprehension been with you. Now I can no way but by Prayers, Letters, and Councels visit you; and so have sent these, to let you know, that you are upon my Heart, and that your Welfare is dear unto me. I bless the Lord to hear that his Work doth not cease among you. It is the Joy of our Bonds, Beloved, to hear that the Word is not bound, and that Satan hath not his design upon the People of God, who doubtless intended by these Sufferings to have struck Terrour into them, and to have made their Hands weak. Know, dear Christians, that the Bonds of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel are not tedious through Grace unto us, that Christ is a Master worth a suffering for, that there is really enough in Religion to desray all our Charges, and to quit all the Cost and Expence You can be at in or upon it; That you may Build upon it that you can never be losers by Jesus Christ, that Christs Prison is better than the Worlds Paradise, that the Divine Attributes are alone an All-sufficient Livelihood, that the Influences of Heaven, and Shines of Gods Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance are sufficient to lighten the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

These are Truths that the Prisoners of Christ can in a measure Seal unto; and I would have you to be more soundly assured of, and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished in. Brethren, we are of the same mind in a Prison, that we were of in the Pulpit; that there is no Life to a Life of Holiness; that Christ, and his Yoak, and his Cross, are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of all acceptation; that it is the best, and wisest, and safest and gainfullest course in the World to stick close to Christ and his Ways, and to adhere to them in all hazards Come on, Beloved Christians, come on, slack not your pace, but give dilligence to the full assurance of Hope unto the end, and be ye followers of them who through Faith and Patience inherit the Promises. Strengthen the Hands that hang down, and the feeble Knees. If you faint in the day of Adversity, your strength is small. Chear up, my Brethren, look what a Crown, what a Kingdom here is; What say you? Is not here a worthy Portion, a goodly Heritage? Were it not pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to lose all this for want of Diligence and Patience? Come, dear Christians, and fellow Travellers, I pray You, let us put on: Pluck up the weary Limbs, our Home is within sight. Lift up your Eyes from the <hi>Pisga</hi> of the Promises: You may see the Land of Rest. Will any of you think of returning into <hi>Egypt?</hi> God forbid: A little patience, and Christ will come.

him. Onely believe and wait: What not watch with him one hour? Why the Judg is even at the door! And how blessed will you be if you do but continue and hold fast till he come! Watch therefore, and stand fast, quit you like men, be Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and let your hearts be strong: God is your Friend, and you may trust him. He is able to bear you out, and bear you up: Faint not therefore, but be stedfast, unmoveable, abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the works of the Lord, Speak often one to another, provoke to Love, and to good Works. Let the Bay of Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition against Godliness, make the Torrent of your Zeal break over with the more violence. But it's time to end, I have been bold to call upon you, you see; and to stir you up by way of Remembrance. May the Spirit of the most high God excite you, encourage you, enflame you: May these poor Lines be some quickning to you: may the Good-will of him that dwelt in the Bush dwell with you.

                     <p>WHom this will find you, or when, or where, I know not; but I have shot this arrow at a venture. Once you were an Associate with me in <hi>Corpus Christi,</hi> where I remember your blameless Conversation, and your zealous af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection for, and adhesion to the ways and people of God. May you be still found in the same paths of Holiness, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which no man shall see God. The vows of God are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me (which, I confess, I have been too slack to pay) that I would put you in remembrance, and in all Brotherly ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness advise you, to remember from whence you are fallen. I was informed, before your leaving of <hi>England,</hi> of many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy miscarriages, which the great reproach of your holy profession, you had been too manifestly guilty of. I am not without some hope, that the Lord may have since recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led you, and brought you back to himself: and yet not without more fear, lest, if the power of corruption were so strong, as to precipitate you with such violence, at such a time as that was, and in such a place as <hi>England,</hi> as <hi>Oxon</hi> where you had so many encouragements, and inducements, examples, and faithful friendly, watchful observes, you may now much more be carried away, in such a place, and among such Company, as now you may be likely to be in. Sir, I beseech you to be assured, that nothing but the conscience of my duty hath engaged me, now you have been so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years a stranger to me, and are at so many thousand miles distance from me, to write notwithstanding to you. And I beseech you, bear a little with me. Is it wisdom after you have begun in the Spirit, to end in the flesh? you did run well, who hath hindred you? I remember your strict
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:65560:134"/>
walkings, your holy converse, your many tears: will you lose the things that you have wrought? have you found out another a nearer way to Heaven? do you hope to get in at the wide Gate, in the broad way? need I to mind you, that it had been better for you never to have known the way of life, then after you have known it, to turn aside from the Holy Commandment? can you ever enter into Gods Hill, without you be of clean hands, and a pure heart? I know, you are not ignorant, <hi>That strait is the gate, and narrow is the way that leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it:</hi> and will you yet do as the most, and decline the way of strictness, and holy self-denial, and give the flesh the reins? what, when God, that cannot lie, hath said, <hi>If you live after the flesh, you shall die?</hi> Do you not know that you do in vain name the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, except you depart from ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity? I am sure you know it: Oh Sir, consider it, improve it. Oh! have you for learnt Christ, as to think, that the way of Carnal liberty and loosness, the way of evil company and fleshliness, is the way to eternal life? I am not for tying up Salvation to this, or that Opinion: but certainly, let men be of what opinion they will, without strictness, self-denial, and holy diligence, they cannot be saved, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 42. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11, 12. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 15, 16. Once you could say with <hi>David, I am a companion to all them that fear thee:</hi> is it so now? O Sir, let not the wicked entice you. Hath not God said, <hi>A Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion of fools shall be destroyed, Prov.</hi> 13. 20. That you must forsake the foolish, if you desire to live, <hi>Prov.</hi> 9. 6. Sir, I have no more hopes ever to meet you more on Earth: O that I might meet you in Heaven! let us tread the same path of Holiness, and then we shall doubtless meet there. But surely you must deeply, and timely repent of, and return from your grievous back-slidings, or else I desire never to meet in your Heaven. But why should not we, that have so often met in serious and holy Prayer together, we that have so often met at the Lords Table together, we that have so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten eat together, and fasted together, meet in glory together? I beseech you dear Sir, if the Lord hath not already smitten you to the dust, and broken you, and reduced to the ways of holiness, now consider your ways, and turn your feet to his Testimonies. Oh remember that, <hi>The back-slider in heart shall</hi>

In his trespass that he hath trespassed, shall he not die?</hi> I know Prayers can reach you, though at so vast a distance; I shall add to them these Counsels, and commit you to God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining</p>

Every morning remember that thy serving and pleasing of God, is the whole business of that day, and therefore set out accordingly with an express design and intention to please God in thy eating, drinking, visiting, conversing, calling, and duties of thy Relations throughout the day. My most dear heart, I have nothing in the world that doth concern thee, or me so much to write of to thee, as this is. Oh that thou mayst be still be laying up in Heaven! still furthering thy account; still adding to the heap, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing thy glorious reward! nothing is done for God, but thou shalt hear of it again. Whatever is not done for God, is but so much lost. Those things which others do being led by their natural affections and desires, those things do thou do with holy Aims, for spiritual ends, and then God will put it on the account, as so much done for him. So it is my dearest, God keeps a true account. See that thou believe it, and so plow in hope, and sowe in hope, pray and hear with an eye to the sure reward. Let thy hopes be strong and lively, and then thy hands will be strong, and thy resolutions and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons will be strong.

                     <p>MY heart is now a little at rest to write to thee. I have been these three days much disturbed, and set out of frame. Strong solicitations I have had from several hands, to accept very honourable preferment in several kinds, some friends making a Journey on purpose to propound it, but I have not found the invitations (though I confess very honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and such as are or will be suddenly embraced by men of far greater worth and eminency) to suit with the inclinations of my own heart, as I was confident they would not with thine. I have sent away my friends satisfied with the reasons of my refusal, and am now ready with joy to say with <hi>David. Soul return unto thy rest.</hi> But alas, that such things should di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb me, I would live above this lower region, that no pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages or providence whatsoever might put me out of frame, nor disquiet my soul, and unsettle me from my desired rest. I would have my heart fixed upon God, so as no occurrences might disturb my tranquility, but I might be still in the same quiet and even frame. Well, though I am apt to be unsettled, and quickly set off the hinges, yet methinks I am like a Bird out of the nest, I am never quiet till I am in my old way of Communion with God, like the needle in the Compass that is restless, till it be turned towards the the Pole. I can say through grace with the Church, with my soul have I desired thee in the night, and with my Spirit within me have I sought thee early, my heart is early and late with God, and 'tis the business and delight of my life to seek him. But alas, how long shall I be a seeking? how long shall I spend my days in wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and desiring, when my glorified Brethren spend theirs in rejoycing and enjoying? look as the poor imprisoned captive fighs under the burdensome clog of his Irons, and can onely

Oh happy, thrice happy pouls! when shall these Fetters of mine be knocked off? when shall I be set at liberty from this Prison of my body? you are cloted with glory, when I am clothed with dust. I dwell in flesh, in a House of Clay, when you dwell with God in a House not made with hands, eternal in the Heavens. I must be continually clog'd with the cumbersome burden of this Dung-hill Body, that had it not a soul dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in it like Salt as it were to preserve, it would soon turn to putrefaction and corruption, and be as odious and loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some as the filthiest Carrion, when you have put on incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and immortaliey. What continual molestation am I subject to by reason of this flesh? what pains doth it cost me to keep this earthen Vessel from breaking, it must be fed, it must be clothed, it must be exercised, recreated, and which is worst of all cherished with time-devouring sleep, so that I live but little of the short time I have alotted me here: but oh bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed souls, you are swallowed up of immortality and life, your race is run, and you have received your Crown. How cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious must I be to keep me from dangers, how apt am I to be troubled with the cares and fears of this life, molesting my self with the thoughts of what I shall eat, and what I shall put on, and wherewithal I shall provide for my self and mine; when your souls are taken with nothing but God, and Christ, and 'tis your work to be still contemplating, and admiring that love that redeemed you from all this. Alas, how am I encompast with infirmities, and still carry about me Death in my bosome, what pains and cost must I be at to repair the rotten and ruinous building of this earthly Tabernacle, which when I have done I am sure will shortly fall about my ears; when you are got far above mortality, and are made equal with the Angels. Oh I groan earnestly to be clothed upon with my house which is from Heaven, being willing rather to be absent from the Body, and present with the Lord: Oh,

I thank thee for all the dear expressions of thy servent love: Methinks I see it, and feel how it runs through all the Veins of every Letter, nay, every Line; I needed not so chargeable a Testimony as thy golden Token, with which I was something displeased, because I thought thou needest more than my self: but the love there-by expressed is most dearly welcome to me. What thou talkest of Retribution, and of Justice doth not so well relish
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:65560:137"/>
with me, because the Phrases seem improper to the love pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest between us, I never looked for any return from thee but love, which is the paying of all thy Debts: my expences have indeed been vast and almost incredible; but surely goodness and mercy hath followed me, and do follow me in every place, and in every change of my condition; so that as to temporals I have lack of nothing, and as for spirituals I abound and superabound, and the streams of my comforts have been full and ruuning over; the joy of the Lord hath been my strength at weakest, and in the multitude of my thoughts within me, his comforts have refresh'd my Soul, I have found God a satisfying portion to me, and have sat down under his shadow with full delights, and his fruit is most sweet to my taste: he is my strength and my Song, for I will take of him, and write of him with perpetual pleasure. Through grace, I can say, methinks I am now in my Element, fince I have begun to make mention of him, I am rich in him, and happy in him, and my soul saith unto him with <hi>David,</hi> Thou hast made me most blessed for evermore, and happy is the hour that ever I was born to be made partaker of so blissful a Treasure, so endless a felicity, so Angelical Prerogatives, as I have in him; O sweet are his converses, how delightful it is to triumph in his Love!</p>
                     <p>Suffer me to be free with thee, where should I pour out my Soul, if not into thy bosom? did the poor woman call upon her friends and neighbours to rejoyce together with her at the finding of a lost Groat? and shall not I tell to thee the keeper of the sacrets of my Soul, and the friend of my inmost bosom, what a friend is the Lord to me, though an unworthy sinner, shall not I run and tell thee what a treasure I have found. And here methinks the story of the Lepers comes not unaptly to my mind, who said one to another when they had eat and drunk, and carried away silver and gold, and rayment, and went and hid it, <hi>we do not well, this day is a day of good tidings and we hold our peace.</hi> It is fit that I should be cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with shame; I acknowledge before God, who trieth the hearts, I am unworthy, everlastingly unworthy, but it is not fit that he should lose his praise, nay rather, let him be the more ador'd, and magnifi'd, and admir'd for ever and ever, and let my Secrets say, Amen. Bless the Lord, O my soul
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:65560:138"/>
bless the Lord, O my Friend, let us exalt his Name toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he is my solace in my solitude, he is my standing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter, my tried friend my sure refuge, my safe retreat, he is my Paradise, he is my Heaven; and my heart is at rest in him: and I will sit and sing under his shadow, as a Bird a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Branches; and whither should I go but unto him? Shall I leave the fatness of the Olive, and sweetness of the Fig-tree, and of the Vine, and go and put my trust under the shadow of the Bramble? No, I have made my everlasting choice: this is my rest for ever, he is my Well-beloved in whom I am well pleased. Suffer me to boast a little here, I may Glory without vanity, and I can praise him without end or measure, but I have nothing to say of my self: I find thou dost overvalue me, and magnifie me above my measure; set the Crown upon the head of Christ, let nothing be great with thee but him, give him the glory: but thy love pleaseth me, only I have this exception, that thou art in love with thine own Idol, as <hi>Austin</hi> somewhere speaks to a friend of his that did too much magnifie him, and magnifiest a Creature of thine own sancie, and not thy poor <hi>Orestes:</hi> God that knoweth all things, knoweth my poverty, how little, how low, and how mean I am, and how short I come of the attainments of the Saints, who yet do themselves come so exceedingly short of the Rule that God hath set before us: I often think of the Complaint of the devout <hi>Monsier</hi> [I feel my self very poor this week, and very defective in the love of God; if you would know wherein you may pleasure me, love God more; that what is wanting in me, may be made up in the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of your love:] in this, my <hi>Pylades,</hi> in this thou mayest most highly pleasure me; love God a little the better, praise him a little the more for my sake; let me have this to please my self in, that God is a little the better loved for me, and that I have blowed up, if it be but one flash, nay, but one spark of Divine Love in the bosom of my dearest friend to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him.</p>
                     <p>But why, my <hi>Pylades,</hi> why is thy stile towards me chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? why hast thou lost the old and wonted strain of our former pleasing familiarity? this I could not but observe with some disgust, is it because thy heart is changed; but this is a question in which I cannot ask any resolution; I am satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:65560:138"/>
and at rest in thy love, but what this alterations means, I know not; art thou willing by degrees to grow strange; it cannot be, thou seest however that I cannot change my voice.</p>
                     <p>Busides, I find some jealous passages in thy last lines unto us; but cast thou think that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>But thy needful cautions are acceptable to me, I desire to foresee and provide for manifold changes and storms; I know I am not yet in the Harbor; O pray with me that I enter not into Temptation, for I am very weak in Spirit, as well as in body, God knoweth. But there is no end with me, somewhere or other I must break off, and thou wilt say it is time to shut up; for once onely know, that I am thy daily Orator, and will be whilest I am: and yet once more I must have room to add my thankful acknowledgement of thine and thy cost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kindness; and so with our most dear affections to you both, I commend you to the God of love, still abiding.</p>

                     <opener>
                        <salute>Most Honoured Sir,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>MAny charges have passed over both you and my self, since my last Writing to you, but I am glad to hear that in that great change of your condition, you have made so wise and happy a choice. Mine unfeigned desire to God is for your Temporal and Spiritual prosperity; and that the blessings of both Worlds may be heaped up upon you. Yet I should desire you not to expect too much here, nor to count it a strange thing, if you meet with disappointments. It is enough if you have the Lord for your portion, and Heaven for your Inheritance, though the World should not answer your expectations. I doubt not but you will be likely, as well we, to meet with manifold temptations: the Lord make you, when you have done all to stand. Hold out a while in faith, patience, and self-denial, and you shall be as sure as God can make you of the Crown. Now arise and shine, and hold forth the power of holiness in all your converse. We have lived in times when Religion was the way to credit and esteem, and then it was more difficult to discern the sincerity of ones profession, because men might be drawn to it upon worldly ends. But now is the time when God will prove us, if we will appear for him, and own his ways, when they are the common scorn of the World. Oh Sir, think it not hard if God do call you forth to own him in such a time as this, when few of your rank and quality will bear you company: but look upon it as a special advantage to prove your sincerity, and your fidelity to the Lord your Maker. The holy and blessed life of that noble Marquess <hi>Galeacius,</hi> I should much commend to your reading and Imitation. Court not the world nor its preferments, <hi>Moses</hi> his self-denying choice, which the World would have branded for unparalled folly, when he voluntarily left all the Court-preferments and pleasures, the wisest Judge commends for the greatest Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. If Religion will make you vile, resolve with that Royal Worthy, that you will be yet more vile. Remember who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:65560:139"/>
the reproaches of Christ greater riches, than the Treasures of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Verily it is a greater honour to you to be vilified for Christ, than to be dignified with the highest Titles that the greatest on Earth can confer: and to be call'd <hi>Puritan,</hi> or <hi>Phanatique,</hi> for the bold and constant owning of the power of Christianity, than to have whole Pages filled up with the honourable offices and marks of Dignity, that earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Princes can bestow. Now then is your time to get the true honour. Few of your places and dignity, will take this way to get it: But he that can but use the prospective of Faith, and look as far as the approaching Judgment, will easily see the vanity of the worlds riches and slattering preferments, and the everlasting glory and honour wherewith the dispised Saints shall surely be Crowned. Fix your eyes and Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions here, and that will set you above the worlds temptations, when by its offers or threatnings it would make you to warp, and to let go your hold-fast of Eternal life. Now is the time for you to make Heaven sure, and when that is done, you are prepared for the worst that can come. I desire you to accept of my service and respects, and my Wives, which I do hereby present unto you, and to your most deserving yoak-fellow, whom I unfeignedly honour though I never saw her, not so much for her noble blood, which yet calls for great respects, as for her far more noble qualifications, and priviledges of her second birth. Pardon my boldness with you in troubling you so long, I am Sir,</p>

                     <opener>
                        <salute>Dear Couzin,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>THough I have been in the valley of the shadow of death, though I have had more than one foot in the Grave, and have been in deaths often, yet the love and remembrance of you, ever liveth on my heart: I have long had neither feet to walk nor hands to write, yet I have borrowed hands as you see, rather than I would stay any longer from warning and admonishing of you. Dear Couzin, that soul of yours, that precious immortal soul is of no light value with me! I pray hard for its Salvation: I have a Godly fear for you, lest your soul should miscarry in a crowd of worldly business, and of earthly cares. Ah, my dear Niece, it comforts me that you are so setled for this world, and are in want of nothing, I bless the Lord for this, but me thinks this doth not satisfie me. Oh, that I could be sure that you were once safe setled in Christ; though you are, I trust comfortably furnished with earthly things, yet in this you are but half provided for: have you a Treasure in Heaven? have you laid hold on eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life? have you made sure work for everlasting? have you past the straits of the New-Birth? do your bear upon you the marks of the Lord Jesus?</p>
                     <p>If you shall pass by a sumptuous Fabrick, and a great Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and should lay claim to all as your inheritance, and please your self with the hopes of enjoying all this, when you had nothing to shew, no Writing, no Evidence to produce, as a ground for any such hope, would not every one say, this were a piece of strange vanity and imprudence; much greater fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is it to promise our selves a part in Paradise, and rest satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in a meer perswasion that we are the Heirs of Heaven, when we cannot prove our Title from the Book of God, nor produce from within our selves, the sure and certain marks of the children of God.</p>
                     <p>Ah, Dear Couzin, Rouze up your self make conscience, to
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:65560:140"/>
deal plainly and freely with your soul, say within your self, I have hopes for Heaven; but where are my grounds and my Evidences? do I not build without a foundation? do I ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture my Salvation upon meer uncertainties? What have I, what do I more than others? I pray, I hear, I read, but may not a meer Hypocrite do all this? I run not with others into the wretched practice of Lying, and Couzening, Whoredom, and the like; but what is this more than a Pharisee may have to say for himself? can I prove by Scripture my claim to Heaven? can I produce Chapter and Verse to justifie my self?</p>
                     <p>Oh Couzin, fear, least a Promise being lest of entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to rest, you should by any mistakes, or self-deceits fall short through unbelief; fear lest you should take Counters of gold, or some common workings for saving Grace. Oh, there is a world of counterfeit Coin going, multitudes perish by mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, and wake in Hell, whilest they dreamt they were in Heaven: the tempter is very subtile, and will sure deceive if he can: your heart is deceitful above all things, and is willing to cheat you if it can. Therefore am I engaged so earnestly to call upon you, as one that watcheth for your soul, to arise speedily and to set roundly to your Work. Oh, consider your danger, and work out your Salvation with fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling: away with these lazie Prayers, away with these cold and heartless Professions, away with this drowsie, liveless, liftless Religion; bestir your self to purpose for your Soul before it be too late. Search your Conscience as with Candles, be jealous of your self; consider, now is your time, what you do you must do quickly, the patience of God is waiting, Christ is knocking, the Spirit of God is striving, and death is at the door: Oh now take your opportunity, and take heed lest a slothful heart, and the cares of this world, or a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous confidence that all is well and safe already, should at last shut you out of the Kingdom of God.</p>
                     <p>I cannot write distinctly to your Husband, but I beseech you to call upon him to set his heart to these Counsels which I have written to you; I earnestly entreat him to make Religion his business, and to look heedfully to it, that the gain of the world prove not the loss of his soul. I desire him that Closet and Family Prayers, and weekly Catechesing of his Hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:65560:141"/>
and strict sanctifying of the Sabbath, and reading of the Scriptures, singing of Psalms, repeating of Sermons, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent attendance upon powerful Preaching may be his conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual exercises; that so his house may be a little Church, and God may delight to dwell in his Family: pray give me to understand what is done of these things, for I have a zeal for your welfare, and that you and your Houshould should serve the Lord, that you may enter into his rest, and carry chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and servants, and friends, and all to Heaven with you. As to my own estate, I have lost all my Limbs, and about this twelve Months useless, and been again and again under the sentence of death; but was brought in a Horse-litter to <hi>Bath,</hi> where God hath wonderfully restored me, so that I can seed my self, and go alone, and speak with a little more freedom. Oh, love the Lord, praise the Lord for me; notwithstanding I continue weak, and have not strength to write, yet I could not tell how to die in silence from you; but have made use of a friendly hand to send these counsels and calls after you, which I beseech you to accept in the fear of God, for it is not unlike that they may be my last to you that ever you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive: I now commend you to the Lord, and with mine own and my dear Wives love to you both, Rest,</p>

                        <salute>Dear Cousin,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>YOU may think you are forgotten with me, because you have not heard so long a time from me; but this may let you know, That though God hath taken away your Father, and suffered your Mother to be help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less to you; yet you have one friend on earth that ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth for you. The welfare of your immortal soul is dear to me, and is the matter of my sollicitous care and prayer. <hi>Dear Cousin,</hi> Methinks I feel a godly jealousie of you within my heart, lest you should lose your soul amongst a croud of worldly cares and business. Oh remember the story of him in the Book of the <hi>Kings,</hi> who relates that he had a Soldier committed to his keeping, upon condition that he should lose his life if he did let him go: <hi>But while thy servant went hither and thither, the man escaped.</hi> But the King replies presently, <hi>Even so shall thy judgment be; thy life shall go for his life.</hi> Ah <hi>Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sin,</hi> take earnest heed, lest while you are going hither and thither, minding many things, tossed in a hurry of worldly affairs, the enemy run not away with your soul. Oh beware that the world doth not secretly steal away your heart. Consider, that whatever your business be, you must and will have an eating time, and a sleeping time. Oh be as sollicitous every day to keep your praying times, which are a thousand times more necessary than a time to eat in, or sleep. Be sure that there doth not a morning or evening pass over your head, in which you have not perfumed your closet with solemn and fervent prayer: And take heed, if you love your salvation,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:65560:142"/>
lest Satan beguile you with the bare outward perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of duties, and outward acts of Religion. See to it, that you do not rest in a worldly Religion; to give God your knee, while the World carries away your heart. You may pray, hear, and read, and all to no purpose, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cep your very Soul be employed and engaged in these duties; and the life, vigour, and strength of your affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions be found to go after God in them. If therefore you will have Christ and Heaven, see that you renounce the world. You must cast overboard your worldly hopes, and take up with God, with a naked Christ, as your whole happiness, both for this life, and that which is to come. There is no hopes of your salvation, without a sound mortification to the world; you must be mortified to your worldly expectations: look not for much from the world; promise not your self much from the world; seek not great things for your self: say unto God, So I may have thee for my portion, and thy Kingdom for my inheritance, give or deny me what thou wilt, poverty or riches, any thing or nothing, I will be contented with my Lot. Say unto your soul, So I may but have Christ, so I may but carry it for the other world, let this world go which way it will: I must be converted or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned; I must be born again, or else would I had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been born: but of this present world there is no such necessity; I may be poor, and yet happy: but wo to me if I remain unsanctified: I must have grace, or perish for ever. <hi>Dear Cousin,</hi> if I live, you shall find me a friend to your worldly prosperity; but whether I live or die, I charge you by the Lord, that you be infinitely tender of your immortal Souls everlasting concernments. Will you not spin a fair thread of it, if while you are pursuing after earthly things, you lose your soul in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>THE welcom tidings of your safe arrival at <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badoes,</hi> is come to my ears; as also the news of your escape from a perillous sickness, for which I bless the Lord, and desire to be thankful with you: for I am not without a care for your well-being, but do look upon my self as really concerned in you. I have considered, that God hath bereft you of a careful Father, and that your Mother takes but little care for you; so that you have none nearer than my self to watch for your soul, and to charge and admonish you in the Lord, and to take care of you. But yet, <hi>Dear Cousin,</hi> be not discoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by these things, but look to Heaven, flie unto Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, put away every known sin, set upon the conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious performance of every known duty; make Christ your choice, embrace him upon his own terms; deliver up your self, body and soul, to him; see that you have no reserves nor limitations in your choice of him; give him your very heart; cast away your worldly hopes and expectations, make Religion your very business. O Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sin, these things do, and you shall be sure of a Friend in Heaven to take the care of you; and, if I may be any comfort to you, you shall not fail, while I live, to have one friend on earth to take care for you. You are gone far from me, even to the uttermost parts of the earth; but I have sent these Letters to call even thither after you; yea, not onely to call, but to cry in your ears, O what is like to become of your soul! Where is that immortal soul of yours like to be lodged for ever? amongst De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, or amongst Angels? upon a bed of Flames, or in
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:65560:143"/>
the joys of Paradise? Dear Cousin, go aside by your self in secret, retire from the noise of the world, and say to your self, <hi>Oh my soul! whether art thou going? do not I know in my very heart that I must be converted or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned? that I must be sanctified, or can never be saved?</hi> Oh my soul! what seekest thou? what designs do I drive at? what is my chief care? which way do I bend my course? Is it for this world, or for the world to come? Do I first seek the kingdom of heaven, and the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness thereof? Do I think Heaven will drop into my mouth? that glory and immortality will be gotten with a wet finger, with cold prayers, and heartless wishes, while the world carries the main of my heart? Do I think to be crowned, and yet never fight? to get the race, and never run? to enter at the strait gate, and never strive? to overcome Principalities and Powers, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver wrestle? No, no; say within your self, Oh my soul, either lay by the hopes of Heaven for ever, or else rouse up thy self, put forth thy strength in seeking after God and glory; either lay by thy worldly hopes, or thy hopes of immortality; away with thy sins, or thou must let Christ go for ever; think not to have Chrst and the world too, to serve God and Mammon, it cannot be: If thou follow the world as thy chief desire and delight; if thou live after the flesh, thou must die, count upon it, the Lord hath spoken it, and all the world can never reverse it. Thus reason the case with your own soul, and give not rest to your self night nor day, till you are gotten off from the world, broken off from the wilful practice of every known sin, and gotten safe into Christ. Dear Cousin, I charge you by the Lord, to observe these things; pray over them, weep over them, read them again and again; do not pass them over as slight and ordinary things: your soul is at stake, it is your salvation is concerned in them; think not I am in jest with you. Ah Cousin, I travel in birth with you, till Christ be formed in you. Why should you die? Oh repent and live, lay hold on eternel life, win Christ, and you win all. O be thankful to the Lord, that now you are fatherless and friendless, yet you have one Remembrancer to warn you to flie from the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:65560:143"/>
wrath to come. God forbid that I should find you at last in the place of Torments, for your not embracing the godly Counsels. To conclude, in short, I charge you as a Minister, as a Friend, as a Father to you, Take heed of these three things:</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <hi>1.</hi> Left the gain of the world prove the loss of your soul:</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <hi>2.</hi> Left the snare of evil company withdraw you from God, and so prove your final ruine.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <hi>3.</hi> Left a lofty and a worldly heart should thrust you out of the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
                     <p>God abhors that the proud should come near him: Oh labour, whatever you do, for an humble heart; be little, be vile in your own eyes; seek not after great things; be poor in spirit; without this, Heaven will be no place for you, God will be no friend to you. Dear Cousin, your lot is fallen, as I fear, in a place of great wickedness, where your soul is in much danger, where your tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are many, and your helps for Heaven but few; where godly examples are rare, and many will entice you to sin and vanity. O! if you love me, or love your soul, look about you, consider your danger, fear lest you should miscarry for ever by worldly loss and vain company, which proves to so many the fearful cause of their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal perdition. I can but warn you, and pray for you: but though you have none to oversee you, remember the strict and severe eye of God is upon you, to observe all your actions, and that he will surely bring all your pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices into his Judgment. Your Aunt, with my self, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend our dear love to you; and I commend you to the Lord, and remain,</p>

                        <salute>Dear Cousins,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>THough you are removed far from me, out of my sight, and the Seas as a great gulf are fixed betwixt you and me; yet my prayers follow you, and my good wishes for your present and everlasting welfare, like the wings of a Dove, take speedy flight. I look upon my self, now God hath removed my Brother, to be as in the room of a Father to you, yea and of a Mother too; for I know you have but little help from her.</p>
                     <p>My dear Neeces, my heart is careful for you; and therefore I cannot cease, while I am in being in this world, to warn and admonish you, as my children, and to call upon you in the name of the Eternal God, to awaken your selves with all godly fear and holy diligence, lest by any means you should come short of the glory of God.</p>
                     <p>Let me mind you, dear Cousins, of the dangerous place you stand in, and look about you with trembling. Methinks I see Satan watching for your souls, as the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon did for the seed of the Woman, waiting to devour it as soon as she should be delivered. Know you not, that you must wrestle with Principalities and Powers? Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks I see temptations surrounding you, and beleaguer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you, as the enemy about the walls of the treacherous party within you, I mean carnal affections and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, complotting how to deliver up the castle. Know you not, that your fleshly lusts do war against your souls? and that your own hearts are not true to you, but deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful above all things? Lord, what need have you to bestir your selves, and to flie unto Jesus! to distrust your selves, and to trust onely in him and his righteousness! Oh work out your salvation with fear and trembling: Do you ever think to escape these mighty enemies, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer the power, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:65560:144"/>
potent adversaries, without most painful diligence? O cry to heaven for help; watch and pray; fear, left a promise being left of entring into rest, either of you should come short of it.</p>
                     <p>My dear Neeces, you have many do watch for your souls, to devour them; but I doubt too few, except my self, do watch for your souls, to save them: therefore I look upon my self, who am now upon the matter your only Monitor, to be the more concerned to awaken my self to your help, and to look after you, and to watch for you, left by any means you should miscarry by the deceits and temprations wherewith you are encompassed. I would not have you over-careful for the things of this life, though I commend your laudable care and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, that you may not be burdensom to any man; but I commend to you a better and more necessary care, and that is that which the Apostle speaks of, the Virgins care; <hi>The unmarried</hi> (saith he) <hi>careth for the things of the Lord.</hi> Ah, let this be your care; seek first the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, and the Righteousness thereof, and then all these things shall be added; you have Gods sure promise for it: If the Lord give me to live and prosper, you shall see and know, that I am not a friend only in words to you; but however that shall be, see that you embrace the Counsels of God from me. Oh make sure of Heaven betimes, walk humbly with God, beware of a proud heart and a lofty spirit; abhor your selves, else God will not accept you? be displeased with your selves, else God will not be pleased with you; condemn your selves, that God may acquit you. The leven of pride will sowr the whole lump, and mar all your Profession and Religion, and render your Persons, and Prayers, and all, an abomination to the Lord, if it prevail in you. Oh therefore be not high minded, but fear; and by prayer and watchfulness restrain and root up this wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed corruption of pride, which is a sin so natural to you, that you had need to use an infinite care and caution to keep it under.</p>
                     <p>As to my self, these may acquaint you, That I have been often at the very gates of death: I have lost all my

limbs; but prayer hath redeemed me from my extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and God hath blessed the use of the <hi>Bath</hi> to me. Oh praise the Lord, praise him for my sake, and give glory to the God of my life. Love him, honour and glorifie him, whose favour and friendship hath filled my soul with comfort, and given a resutrection to my body. I can now walk alone, and feed my self, but am altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to write, which is the reason why these come to you in another hand.

                     <opener>
                        <salute>Dear Friend,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>I Have received yours of the 19th of <hi>September,</hi> but it came to me in the time of my sickness, in which I was much a stranger to writing; it continued upon me five Months, and to this day so much weaknes remains in my arms, that I am not able to put off or on my own clothes. Your Letter was exceeding welcom to me, not only as reviving the remembrance of our old friendship, but also, as bringing me news of some spiritual good that you received by me, which is the best tidings that I can receive: for what do I live for, but to be use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to souls in my generation? I desire to know no other business than to please and honour my God, and serve my generation in that short allowance of time that I have here, before I go hence, and be seen no more. Shall I commend to you the Lesson that I am about to learn? But why should I doubt of your acceptance, who have so readily embraced me in all our converses?</p>
                     <p>The Lesson is, <hi>To be entirely devoted unto the Lord, that I may be able to say after the Apostle, To me to live is Christ.</hi> I would not be serving God onely for a day in the week, or an hour or two in the day; but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, and all the day: I am ambitious to come up towards that of our Lord and Master, <hi>To do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways those things that please God.</hi> I plainly see, that self-seeking is self-undoing; and that then we do promote our selves best, when we please God most. I find, that when I have done all, if God be not
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:65560:146"/>
pleased, I have done nothing; and if I can but approve my self to God, my work is done: I reckon I do not live that time I do not live unto God.</p>
                     <p>I am fain to cut off so many hours from my days, and so many years from my life (so short as it is) as I have lived unto my self. I find no enemy so dangerous as self; and O that others might take warning by my hurt! O that I had lived wholly unto God! then had every day and every hour that I have spent, been found upon my account at that great day of our appearing before God: then I had been rich indeed, in treasure laid up there, whither I am apace removing; then I had been every day and hour adding to the heap, and encreasing the reward which God of his meer grace hath promised, even to the meanest work that is done to him, <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 24. I verily perceive I am an eternal loser by acting no more as for God; for what is done to my self, is lost; but what is done for God, is done for ever, and shall receive an everlasting reward. Verily, if there be another world to come, and an eternal state after this short life, it is our onely wisdom to be removing, and, as it were, trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planting and transporting what we can, from hence, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that Countrey to which we are shortly to be removed, that what we are now doing, we may be reaping the fruit of for ever more. The world think themselves wise; but I will pawn my soul upon it, that this is the true wisdom.</p>
                     <p>Well, let us be wholly swallowed up in the concerns of Religion, and know no other interest but Jesus Christs. I cannot say, I have already attained; but this is that my heart is set to learn, That in all that I do, whether sacred or civil actions, still I may be doing but one work, and driving on one design, <hi>That God may be pleased by me, and be glorified in me;</hi> that not onely my praying, preaching, alms, &amp;c. may be found upon my account; but even my eating, drinking, sleeping, visits, discourses, because they are all dont as unto God. Too often do I take a wrong aim, and miss my mark; but I will tell you what be the Rules I set my self, and do strictly impose upon my self from day to day: <hi>Never to lie down, but in the</hi>
                        <pb n="155" facs="tcp:65560:146"/>
                        <hi>Name of God,</hi> not barely for natural refreshment, but that a wearied servant of Christ may be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, and fitted to serve him better the next day. <hi>Never to rise up but with this resolution, Well, I will go forth this day in the Name of God, and will make Religion my business, and spend the day for Eternity. Never to enter upon my calling, but first thinking, I will do these things as unto God,</hi> because he requireth these things at my hands in the place and station he hath put me into. <hi>Never to sit down to the Table, but resolving, I Will not eat meerly to please my appetite, but to strengthen my self for my Masters work. Never to make a Visit, but upon some holy design, resolving to leave something of God where</hi> I <hi>go; and in every company to leave some good savour behind.</hi> This is that which I have been for some time a learning, and am pressing hard after; and if I strive not to walk by these Rules, let this Paper be a witness against me.</p>
                     <p>I am not now in my former Publick Capacity, such things being required of me to say and subscribe, as I could by no means yield to, without open lying and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling with God and Men: Yet, that I am unuse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, I cannot say; but rather think, that possibly I may be of more use than heretofore. I thank the Lord, I have not known what it is to want a Tongue to speak, but in my sickness; nor a People to hear; but so, as that we both follow the things that make for peace.</p>
                     <p>I perceive you are otherwise perswaded in some things, than I am: but however, I trust we meet in our end. Since you are in, may it be your whole stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to gain souls, and to build them up in holiness, which is with too many the least of their cares. One duty (miserably neglected) I shall be bold to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to you from my own experience, and that is, the visiting your whole Flock from house to house, and enquiring into their spiritual estates particularly, and dealing plainly and truly with them about their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        <salute>Worthy Sir,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>I Owe you a Letter, and more than a Letter, for your particular respects to me, your brotherly sympathy, your multiplied and earnest prayers, your tenderness of my health, your welcom Jewel in M. <hi>Ruths</hi> Letters, from which I trust my soul and others may reap no small benefit. Much more do I owe you for your common re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects to the people of my desires; and not only to them, but to the whole Church of God; in all whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments, I see, you are concerned. Your indefatigable labours with us, we do with all thankfulness accept, as the undoubted evidence of your great love: For all which, may he requite you, who will shortly say, <hi>Inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as thou didst it unto the least of these my Brethren, thou didst it unto me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It was but a little after my release from my own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, but I heard of yours; and now write to you, as one that hath taken a higher degree than ever, and more truly honourable, being commenced Prisoner of Christ. I was once affected with the Picture of a devout man, to whom a voice came down from Heaven, saying, <hi>Quid vis fieri prote?</hi> To which he answered, <hi>Nihil domine nisi pati ac contemni prote.</hi> Undoubtedly, Sir, it is our real glory to be throughout conformed to Jesus Christ, not only in his sanctity, but in his sufferings. <hi>Paul</hi> counted all things but dung for this, that he might win Christ, &amp;c.
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:65560:148"/>
and know the fellowship of his sufferings, and be made conformable to his death. I doubt not but your conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations in Christ do much more then superabound in all your tribulations for him: Yet let me add this one Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial, That now you have a whole shoal of Promises come in to you, which you had not before; I mean, all the Promises to suffering Saints, in which they have not so immediate, but onely a remoter right, unless in a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering state: And doubtless he hath gotten well, that hath gotten such a number of exceeding great and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Promises: If the men of the world do so rejoyce when such or such an Estate is fallen to them; should not you much more, that have such a Treasure of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises fallen to you?</p>
                     <p>I can tell you little good of my self; but this I'can tell you, That the Promises of God were never so sweet in this world to me, as in and since my imprisoned state. Oh the bottomless Riches of the Covenanr of Grace! It shames me that I have let such a Treasure lie by so long, and have made so little use of it. Never did my soul know the Heaven of a Believers life, till I learnt to live a life of praise, and by more frequent consideration to set home the unspeakable riches of the Divine Promises, to which, I trust, through grace, I am made an heir. I verily perceive, that all our work were done at once, if we could but prevail with our selves and others to live like Believers; to tell all the world by our course and carriage, that there is such pleasantness in Christs wars, such beauty in holiness, such reward to obedience, as we prosess to believe. May ours and our peoples conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions but preach this aloud to the world, That there is a reality in what God hath promised; That Heaven is worth the venturing for; That the sufferings of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us!</p>
                     <p>Verily, Sir, it is but a very little while that Prisons shall hold us, or that we shall dwell in dirty flesh. <hi>

Well, they must shortly off all together; our Lord doth not long intend us for this lower Region: Surely he is gone to prepare a place for us: Doubtless it is so; yea, and he will come again, and receive us to himself, that where he is, we may be also. And what have we to do, but to believe, and wait, and love, and long, and look out for his coming, in which is all our hope? 'T will be time enough for us to be preferred then. We know before hand who shall then be uppermost. Our Lord hath shewed us where our place shall be, even at his own right hand; and what he will say to us, <hi>Come ye blessed, &amp;c.</hi> Surely we shall stand in his Judgment: He hath promised to stand our Friend: Let us look for the joyful day: As sure as there is a God, this day will come, and then it shall go well with us.

Why should it not be thus? I am sure God and Heaven do as well deserve to be thought on, and talked of by us, as froth and vanity can deserve of the world. There are many that have in a great measure learnt this lesson, and why should not we be some of them? What if it be hard at first? Every thing is so to a beginner. Besides, is not ours a Religion of self-denial? Further, if we do but force our selves a while to holy Thoughts, and Heavenly Discourse, it will grow habitual to us, and then it will be most natural, familiar, and heavenly sweet. Oh what gainers will you be, if you do but learn this Lesson!</p>
                     <p>Verily, it's the shame of Religion, that Christians are so unlike themselves, unless upon their knees. Sirs, our lives and language should tell the world what we are, and whither we are going. Christians, let little things content you in the world, but aspire after great things in the grace of God. Many real Christians do little think what high frames of Holiness they might grow up to, even in this life, with pains and diligence. Sirs, be you men of great designs: Think it not enough if you have wherewith to bear your charges to Heaven; but aspire with an holy ambition to be great in the Court of Heaven, Favourites of the most High, of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

'Tis the disgrace of Profession, that there is so little difference to be seen in the ordinary coversation of Believers from other men: Is it not a shame, that when we are in company with others, this should be all the difference that is to be seen, onely that we will not curse and swear, as do the

worst of men? Christians, if you will honour the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, bring forth your Religion out of your Closets (the world can't see what you do there) into your Shops, Trades, Visits, &amp;c. and exemplifie the rules of Religion in the management of all your Relations, and in your ordinary converse. Let there be no Place or Company that you come into, in which you do not drop something of God: This will be the glory of Religion, and we shall never convince the World till we come to this. May you come my Brethren, out of your Prisons with your faces shining, having your minds seasoned, and your tongues <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Oh, if any of you that wanted Assurance when you came to Prison, may carry that blessing out, what happy gainers would you be! Now you are called more than ever to self-searching. Now bring your Graces to the Touchstone. Be much in Self Observation. See what your hearts do with most love and delight, go out unto: what are your greatest hopes, and your chief de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs. See whether God's Intrest be uppermost in you: prove this, and prove all. Rest not in probable hopes. Think not that is enough that you can say, you hope 'tis well. God lookes for extraordinary things from you under such great helps, such extraordinary Dispensations. Be restless till you can say, that You know. 'tis well? that you know you are passed from Death to Life</p>
                     <p>Think not that this is a priviledge that only a few may expect. Observe but these three things:</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <hi>1.</hi> To acquaint your selves throughly with the conditions of Life, and take heed of laying the marks of Solvation ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther too high or too low.</p>

                     <p>But I return to your self. But what shall I say? I have more need to receive from you, than abilitie to give; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I will tell you my wishes for you: I wish that your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy may prosper, as your soul also prospereth.

                        <salute>SIR,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>THIS Letter cometh to you, like the men of <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> to <hi>Paul,</hi> crying to you, <hi>Come and help us.</hi> O how insufficient do we find our selves for the Praises of GOD! What Reason have we to call upon our selves, and to call upon all our Friends! and yet we foresee that all will be too little a Sacrifice at last, and too slender a return to the most High God, who hath made us such wonders of Mercy, and such signal instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his Divine Power and Rich Grace. You are not ignorant of our Estate, how the Sentence of Death had passed upon us; how our Flesh and our Hearts failed, and Friends and Physicians gave up their Hopes: But God, that raised the Dead, was pleased to make us the Monuments of his wondrous Mercy. O that the same God would make us the special instruments of his Praise and Glory. Of a Truth Sir, we perceive our Hearts are too little, our Tongues are too shore, our Expressions are too low, either to conceive or ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what we owe to the Great God. O help! help! Bless the Lord, O our Souls: Bless the Lord, O our Friends: O that all that have Wrestled with God for us, might joyn Hand in Hand to make some suitable returns to the God of our lives, and may bring in every one his Sacrifice, and all contribute to make one common stock of Praises, that many Thanksgivings
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:65560:151"/>
may abound to God on our behalfs. O what hath Prayer done for us! while we live we must Honour Prayer, and admire the Power of Prayer, we owe our limbs and our lives to Prayer. O that a goodly crop of praise may grow up unto God as a return for his Mercies: that the seed of Prayers, and showers of tears, may procure sheaves of joy, and Songs of deliverauce.</p>
                     <p>But O what shall we render? wherewithall shall we come before the Lord, or bow our selves to the Most High God? O where shall we find a sitting sacrifice? Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily we will give our selves and our All to him. But alas, what are we, and what is this little that we call <hi>our All?</hi> Therefore have we found in our hearts to write to you and others, that we might excite you to the Divine Praises with us. And O that the Lord might be loved the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and glorified the more for our sakes: Will you tell us wherein we may shew our love to Him? wherein we may best please and serve Him? O that you would! Herein assuredly you would most highly gratifie us. O that we might do some singular thing for God; for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly they are not common things that he hath done for us. We pray you call upon those that fear the Lord, to help us in celebrating his loving kindness. O how it pleaseth our very Hearts to think that God should be Loved and Honoured the better for us: That we may be instruments, if it be but for the blowing up of one flash, nay, the kindling of one spark of Divine Love in the Hearts of his Children towards him! Sir, You cannot pleasure us in any thing so much as in this, To love and admire God, and spread his Praise more and more; that what is wanting through our weakness, may be made up in your abundance. But we have need to crave your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> for our length; but the love of Christ constraineth us, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> we hope you will pass by an error of Love.</p>
                     <p>While we have been deyifing what to do for our God, we thought we could no way better serve him,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:65560:151"/>
than by provoking such as you are to set up his great Name with us. We love and Honour you, not onely as you are a Member, but a Minister of Christ Jesus our LORD, and therefore deserve to be doubly dear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us: And because we could think of no more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing a Sacrifice of Thanksgiving, we have stirred up our selves and Friends with us, to send to you a Prophet in the Name of a Prophet, this poor Token of Love, which though but small, yet we trust will be a sweet savour unto God, and will be accepted with you, being our two Mites cast into God's Treasury. But look not upon your self as obliged to us hereby: but put it upon the Account of Christ, to whose precious Name we dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate it, and from whom (although he be so much already before hand with us, yet) we expect a recompence at the Resurrection of the just.</p>
                     <p>And being further desirous to promote the work of God in our low and slender Capacities, we have been bold to provoke your self, with other our Fathers and Brethren in the Ministry, to set about that necessary and much neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected work of Catechising; not a little pleasing our selves in the sweet hope, that by your means we may be instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to spread the sweet savour of the knowledg of our God, in every place: and being well perswaded of your readiness to forward so blessed a work, we have stirred up our selves and our Friends to expend a considerable Sum of Money to furnish Ministers with Catechisms, a hundred whereof we have sent unto you, beseeching you to use your best prudence and utmost diligence, for the spreading of them, and for others improvement by them, that our labour and charge in so good a work, prove not at last of no effect.</p>
                     <p>Sir, we shall humbly propose unto you, but not impose upon you. But let us be bold with you in Ghrist, to lay our requests before you as touching this concernment, they being indeed what judicious friends and brethren have thought fit to propound.</p>

That you would favour us so far, as to let us know as speedilie as you may, of the receit of these Lines; and, if we may presume so far upon you, we pray you to indulge us some assurance under your Hand, That you will to your Power promote this happy design, and that by our <hi>Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> next you will acquaint Mr. <hi>Bernard</hi> what progress is made.</p>
                     <p>Sir, our Sou's will even travel in Birth for the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of this undertaking; and therefore we request you for the love of God, and by the respect which we are perswaded you bare to us, that you will labour to comfort and encourage us in our endeavours for God, which you can no way in the World do so well, as by letting us see, that there is some Blessed Fruit of our cost and paines; and that we have not run in

                  <p>Now in this Speech of Jesus Christ we have especially to be considered two things, a <hi>prohibition,</hi> and a <hi>permission.</hi> In the first place we have the <hi>prohibition</hi> of our Saviour, in which he forbiddeth them to weep, Daughters of <hi>Jerusalem, weep not for me.</hi> And in the second place we have his <hi>permissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> in which he alloweth them to weep; <hi>but weep for your selves, and for your Children.</hi> And yet you see he doth not

here command and forbid the same things in the same respect, but in relation to a diverse object. In relation <hi>to himself</hi> he forbiddeth them to weep, <hi>Weep not for me.</hi> In relation <hi>to themselves,</hi> he alloweth them to weep, <hi>but weep for your selves, and for your Children.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The total final and irreparable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> was near at hand, our Saviour had it in his eye when he spake these words. He wept apace for this himself but a little while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as you may see, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 41. <hi>He behold the city and wept over it.</hi> First he beholds it with his eye, and then his eye affects his heart, Wo and alas! saith he, (while in a pang of holy pity and compassion, the tears come flowing down his cheeks) <hi>If thou hadst known even thou at least in this thy day the things which belong unto thy peace, but now they are hid from thine eyes.</hi> And therefore he alloweth them to weep for this, who are to have a share and portion in that dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful desolation. But for himself, who willingly submitted to the death which he was leading to, and all the other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of his passion; who was beloved of him who had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed and designed him to it, who was God as well as Man; and therefore able to endure it, and to overcome it too; and who was shortly to be rescued from the jaws of death, and so triumphantly to enter into Glory: He forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them to weep, <hi>weep not so me, but weep for your selves, and for, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that the purpose of our Saviour is not wholly to <hi>sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press,</hi> but to rectifie their sorrow. They wept for him out of a childish kind of pity, but they wept not for their sins, nor the unseen calamities that were about to come upon them. And therefore Christ endeavours to withdraw their sorrow from the <hi>wrong,</hi> and fix it on the <hi>right</hi> object. And to this end he shews them why they <hi>should</hi> not weep, and why they <hi>should. Weep not for me, but for your selves, and for your Children.</hi> Two Observations lie before us in the Text. The first, <hi>That it is not unlawful nor unfit sometimes to express our grief in tears.</hi> The second, <hi>That we are very oubject to misplace our grief, and to mistake the ground and object of our sorrow.</hi> I shall speak to these in order, beginning with the first.</p>

                  <p>We have our Saviours warrant for it in the Text, <hi>weep for your selves, and for your children.</hi> There weep and weep on. How often are we called upon to weep in Scripture? Oh what a cloud of weepers shall we find there, who are all wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses to this great truth. And some of them the <hi>wisest</hi> and the <hi>holiest</hi> mentioned in the Book of God, without excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Our Saviour Christ himself, the holy One, and the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, was a very great Weeper. He was <hi>a man of sorrows,</hi> not of a few, but many sorrows, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. 3. You never read he <hi>laughed</hi> in all his Story, but you find he <hi>wept</hi> often. In the days of his flesh he <hi>offered up strong cries and tears</hi> to God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 7. He wept for his beloved <hi>Lazarus, John</hi> 11. 35. And if we do the like on this occasion, we have a great Example in our eye. He melted over poor undone <hi>Jerusalem</hi> with many tears, who had over-pass'd the day of her gracious Visitation.</p>
                  <p>Look up and down among the poor afflicted and distressed People of the Lord, and you shall find that tears have been as ordinary with them, as their daily food. Thou <hi>feedest them,</hi> saith <hi>Asaph, Psal.</hi> 80. 5.

                  <p>You see then it is not <hi>unlawful,</hi> nor <hi>unfit</hi> sometimes to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press our grief in tears. But you will ask me <hi>what these times are;</hi> I will tell you in a word. <hi>Sinning times,</hi> and <hi>Suffring times,</hi> are weeping times. A word or two of these in order.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Sinning times,</hi> are weeping times. And that whether they be sinning times <hi>with others,</hi> or <hi>our selves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Sinning times <hi>with others,</hi> must be sorrowing times,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65560:156"/>
                     <hi>with us.</hi> Our Saviours <hi>Bowels rowl'd</hi> within him, when he look'd about, and <hi>saw the hardness</hi> of the Peoples hearts, <hi>Mark</hi> 3. 5. <hi>Rivers of waters run down mine eyes</hi> (saith holy <hi>David</hi> to the Lord, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 136.) <hi>because men keep not thy Law.</hi> If they will not hear saith <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> Chap. 13. 17. <hi>My soul shall weep in secret places for their pride, and mine eyes shall weep sore and run down with tears.</hi> My <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Eye</hi> shall weep together. You shall observe that those whom God appointed to be marked and singled out for preservation, in a common desolation, were such as <hi>sighed and cried for the abominations of Jerusalem,</hi> Ezek. 9. 4. They did not only keep themselves from the abominations of the time and place on which the Providence of God had cast them, but they mourned for them in others. They were not meer abstainers, but they were mourners, weepers too, and so were snatched as fire-brands out of the burnings, and set as monuments of the Mercy of God.</p>
                  <p>Brethren, if you define to be preserved in times of common desolation, when the judgments of the Lord are abroad up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth, and on the places of your habitation, and to be <hi>safe in the day of his anger,</hi> work your hearts to this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, while other men are <hi>sinning,</hi> be you <hi>mourning;</hi> While others are committing horrible abominations; be you lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and bewailing them, sighing and crying for those abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations. That when God comes to visit, he may find the sighs breathing from your hearts, the drops running down your cheeks, and all about you wet with tears.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And as sinning times with others, so <hi>our own sinning times especially,</hi> must be our weeping times. Though <hi>David</hi> were a good man, yet he was a <hi>great sinner,</hi> and so he was a <hi>great weeper.</hi> In <hi>Psal.</hi> 6. 6. We find him even drowned in tears. <hi>All the night long</hi> (faith he) <hi>I make my Bed to swim, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my Couch with my tears.</hi> An Hyperbolical expression of unmeasurable weping. So, <hi>Mary Magdalon</hi> had much for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given her, and thereupon she loved much, and <hi>wept much</hi> Yea she made a bath of tears, in which she washed the feet of Christ, <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 37. It is observed of the people of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that when they had surveyed their monstious sins, they <hi>drew forth water</hi> (out of the Fountains of their guilty eyes) <hi>and poured it before the Lord,</hi> 1 Sam. 7. 6. When once
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65560:157"/>
their hard and rockie hearts were smitten with remorse, they melted into tears. They wept <hi>by Buckets,</hi> not <hi>by Drops.</hi> It is a woful frame of heart, when men can sin, but cannot sorrow.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As sinning times are weeping times, <hi>so suffering times</hi> are weeping times. And that whether they be suffering times <hi>with others</hi> or <hi>our selves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Suffering times <hi>with others,</hi> must be sorrowing times with us. We must <hi>weep with them that weep.</hi> The Holy Ghost himself takes notice of it, as remarkable, in <hi>Nehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi> Chap. 1. 4. that when <hi>he heard</hi> of the distresses, of his Brethren, he <hi>sat down</hi> (as one astonied) <hi>and wept and mourned certain dates.</hi> And <hi>Jeremiah</hi> crieth out in such a ease, <hi>Oh that my head were waters</hi> (nothing else) <hi>and mine eyes a fountain of tears,</hi> (both eyes one fountain) <hi>that I might weep day and night</hi> (without cessation) <hi>for the slain of the Daughters of my People.</hi> It is our duty, <hi>to remember them that are in Bonds, as bound with them, and them that are Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed, and broken and undone, as if we our selves were bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and undone with them.</hi> Oh let not it be said of any of us, that we <hi>swim in pleasures,</hi> while our Brethren <hi>swim in tears.</hi> That we have lain upon our costly Beds, and stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our selves upon our Couches, that we have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> the Lambs out of the Flock, and the Calves out of the Stall, that we have chanted to the Viol and invented Instruments of Musick to our selves, that we <hi>drink Wine in bowls, but are not grieved for the afflictions of Joseph,</hi> Amos 6. 4, 5, 6.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And as when others are afflicted, <hi>so when we our selves are so,</hi> it is a proper time to weep. The poor distressed Church draws up a Catalogue of all her troubles, <hi>Lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> 1. 12, &amp;c. And then concludeth at the 16. <hi>Verse, for these things I weep, mine eye, mine eye, runneth down with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> Yea, she complains that she had wept so much, that <hi>her eyes did fail with tears, Lam.</hi> 2. 11. I might give other Scriptures, where you shall find them flowing abundantly on such occasions. But this may satisfie to shew you, <hi>that it is not unlawful, nor unfit, sometimes to express our grief in tears.</hi> And what those <hi>weeping times are:</hi> Times of <hi>sinning,</hi> and times of <hi>suffering,</hi> either with <hi>others,</hi> or with our <hi>selves.</hi>

and unmanly thing to weep, to drop a rear at any time, as if it argued feebleness of mind, and imbecillity of spirit. How many daring Gallants are there in the world, who despise Gods mourners, and look on such as weep, for the <hi>abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> or the <hi>desolations</hi> of the times, as a company of poor weak low Souls. And yet <hi>Hezekiah wept,</hi> and <hi>David wept,</hi> even till he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And where saith he <hi>of mourning</hi> thou art mad, and of sorrow, What is it that thou doest? As he doth of joy and <hi>laughter,</hi> Where do you find a blessing poured out on laughter, as you do on tears and mourning? There are but nine Beatitudes and this is one, <hi>Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted,</hi> Mar. 5. 4. And therefore they deceive themselves who scorn mourners, and labour to put on that Apathie and Idolence, which is so much commended by the <hi>Stoicks:</hi> Who think it is their Patience, and insuperable Fortitude of mind, to be disquiered with nothing, neither sins, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

I have smitten them and they have not grieved, saith God, of hardned <hi>Israel,</hi> Jer. 5. 3. It is not <hi>Patience</hi> but <hi>Stupidity,</hi> that he bewaileth there in that people.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Use</hi> 2. What shall we think of those who have no time for tears, or sorrows: They spend their days in mirth, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and chase away all thoughts from their hearts, be the occasion what it will, or what it can: These are merry men indeed, I wish they would but sadly lay to heart these few Considerations, and I shall pass on to the third Use.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is a <hi>foolish thing,</hi> to melt away in mirth and laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, especially at such a time, when there is nothing upon every side but cause of sorrow. No question they conceive, it is their wisdome to be lively still, however matters go, and to drive away sorrow from their hearts.

                     </hi> If his <hi>body</hi> be not there, yet his <hi>heart</hi> at least, is there. But on the other side, the <hi>heart of Fools is in the house of mirth.</hi> You know they use to paint Fools laughing, and wise men, with a serious grave composed look, And surely there is something in it,

but the Fool hath not the wit to pick it out.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As it is a foolish thing, so it is a <hi>sinful thing,</hi> to give our selves to mitch and laughter, when God calleth us to sorrow. It is a sin which God doth hardly (if at all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give) we find that he hath sealed the Committers of it up to wrath, and bound the guilt of this Iniquity upon their souls never to be removed again. That is a damning sentence which we find, <hi>Isa.</hi> 22. 12. They were formidable Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which the Lord had threatned, and actually inflicted on the Jews. And thereupon he looked they should have carried and demeaned themselves like Mourners, like men that were extreamly sensible of his displeasure, and much affected with his hand upon them. But they despised and slighted all, and gave themselves to mirth and pleasure, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. And as it is a foolish, and a sinful thing, so it is a <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous thing.</hi> There, is a fearful woe denounced to such <hi>as laugh;</hi> for they <hi>shall mourn.</hi> The Lord will one day turn their vain and foolish mirth, to weeping and lamentation. It will be Gall and Wormwood in the latter end. They that are alwaies making mercy, and never grieve at the distress of the church, they <hi>shall go captive with the first, as God</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth, <hi>Amos</hi> 6. 7. Whoever escape they shall be sure to have their portion. The Lord will set them in the Front to undergo the sharpest brunt, and the most fierce encounter of his Vengeance. And though they bear it out a while, the Lord will surely meet with them another day, when they shall have their portion there, where there is <hi>nothing else but Weeping and wailing, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <hi>Use</hi> 3. And therefore in the third place, since there are times to grieve, and to express our grief in tears, let this be a <hi>Caveat to us not to look for too much joy in this world.</hi> Let us not cast too much upon it, lest we be disappointed and deceived. It's that we are very apt to cozen and delude our

selves about, when we are on a merry pin, and flourish in a prosperous estate, it is our manner to conclude that we shall never have a storm again, and that this happy time will never end. And so we run upon a double inconvenience, we grow remiss in making preparations for a time of sorrow; and when it comes upon us unexpected it cuts the deeper, and disquiets us the more. How often shall you hear it from the mouths of some, when any heavy Cross befals them, alas they never dream'd of this, they never look'd to see this doleful day; The weaker and unwiser they. Did they not know what they are, <hi>born to trouble, as the sparks fly upward,</hi> so that they have a natural tendency to it? That they are wandring in a <hi>vale of tears;</hi> in which they must look out for many storms: It was a pretty Speech of <hi>Seneca, Dolor &amp; voluptas inhicem cedunt, brevior voluptas;</hi> Joy and sorrow have still their turns and entercourses here, but Joy (most commonly) hath the speediest dispatch. And therefore in the midst of Joy, let us be wisely casting upon times of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and making preparation and provision for them. And that you may not saint either in the <hi>sence and feeling,</hi> or in the <hi>apprehension and expectation</hi> of them; I shall drop down a few Cordials.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The times of tears and sorrow, are better for us then the times of mirth and laughter.</hi> And hence saith <hi>Solomon,</hi> in the fore-alledged Scriptures, <hi>Eceles.</hi> 7. 2. <hi>It is better to go to the house of mourning then to the house of feasting</hi> Is it not a more <hi>pleasing</hi> good, but is it a more <hi>profitable</hi> good; though it be not more <hi>delightful,</hi> yet it is more <hi>beneficial</hi> to be where there are tears and lamentations, then to be where there is nothing else but laughter.

Indeed this precious Seed delights to have such dews as these; the Seed of Prayer, of Repentance, yea, that Immortal Seed, the Word of God, doth best when it is sown in tears. When we <hi>repent</hi> in tears, our hearts relent and melt most. When we <hi>preach and pray</hi> in tears, we move our selves and others most; — <hi>Si vts me flere, dolendum est Primum ipsi tibi.</hi> This Seed when it is watred thus springs up the faster, and bringeth forth the more plentiful increase.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. These times of grief and tears <hi>will end at last,</hi> and <hi>end in joy. You shall weep</hi> (saith Christ to his Apostles,) <hi>but your sorrow shall be turned into joy. They that sow in tears shall reap in joy; and he that goes forth weeping, bearing precious Seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoycing, bringing his sheaves with him.</hi> There is no doubt, no question to be made of that, and therefore it is bound with an Asseveration, which takes away all scruple from it, he shall <hi>doubtless</hi> come again with rejoycing, bringing his sheaves with him. It is the custome every where to have good chear, and to be merry when they reap. So it was among the Jews, as you may see <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 13, 14. And therefore this is used in Scripture to express the greatest joy, <hi>Isa.</hi> 9. 3. <hi>They shall rejoyce before thee according to the joy of harvest.</hi> So, though the Christian, sows in rainy weather, in a weeping time, all shall be sweet, and calm, and fair, when the reaping time comes. He shall <hi>fit down with</hi> Abraham, <hi>and</hi> Isaac, <hi>and</hi> Jacob, <hi>in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven,</hi> feeding on the hidden Manna, and drinking
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65560:160"/>
of the pure and Crystal River of Water of Life, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Throne of God, and of the Lamb, and there they shall be merry all together. When once he comes to God's immediate presence, he shall have <hi>joy, full joy;</hi> yea, the <hi>fulness of joy, Psal.</hi> 16. last. In his presence is <hi>fulness of joy, and pleasures for evermore.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The <hi>joy that is to come will pay for all.</hi> It will be such, so plentiful and overflowing, that it will make a full amends for all your present tears and sorrow; It will quite overcome the <hi>sense,</hi> and the <hi>remembrance</hi> of them. Alas, our trouble here is nothing, in comparison, it is a light and easie Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then. Our affliction is but short, it continues but a moment, but the time is drawing nigh, when this little light sorrow, shall be wholly swallowed up in endless and unutterable joy, <hi>This short affliction which lasteth but a moment, shall end in everlasting and unmixed pleasures,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 17. It worketh for us, a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory: Oh what transporting comfort is there many times, in reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the first fruits of the Spirit! that we are ready to cry out, if the <hi>first fruits</hi> be so sweet, what will the <hi>Harvest</hi> be? If the <hi>earnest</hi> be so great, what will the <hi>Possession</hi> be? When we shall be filled and satisfied, with the delights that heaven yields to all eternity. I could say as <hi>Peter</hi> once, <hi>It is good to be here, let us build Tabernacles here.</hi> But I must hasten to another Observation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. That we are very subject to misplace our grief, and to mistake the Ground and Object of our sorrow.</p>
                  <p>So did these Daughters of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> you see, they <hi>wept</hi> where they should not, and they <hi>wept not</hi> where they should. And therefore Christ Corrects their Sorrow in the Text; <hi>Daughters of</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>weep not for me, but weep for your selves, and for your Children.</hi> A great part of the sin, and corruption that hath invaded humane nature, consists in the disorder and distemper of our passions and affections; &amp; lies especially in two things, either when we <hi>miss the right object,</hi> or <hi>transgress the just measure:</hi> When they are either <hi>ill placed,</hi> or <hi>ill proportioned:</hi> When we mistake in either of them, When we are troubled where we should not, or too much troubled where we should; we are much to be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65560:161"/>
And both of these we are very subject to. The first is pertinent to our purpose, we are extreamly apt <hi>to grieve and to be troubled where we should not.</hi> It is no wonder that we find <hi>Esau</hi> faulty here, mistaken in the object of his sorrow: <hi>He sought Repentance,</hi> and sought it <hi>carefully with tears;</hi> as you may see, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 17. But what Repentance did he seek with tears? Alas he missed his mark, he sought not his <hi>own,</hi> but <hi>his Fathers Repentance;</hi> feign he would have his Father to Repent of his pouring out the blessing on his younger bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Jacob,</hi> and consequently to revoke it, and to call it back again: But when he saw that was not to be done, and heard his Father say, <hi>I have blessed him, and he shall be blessed, he lifted up his voice and wept,</hi> Gen. 27. 38. Yea the Apostles and Disciples of our Saviour Christ himself mistook in this, that they misapplyed their sorrow. They were extreamly grieved and troubled that Christ was ready to depart, and to withdraw his fleshly presence from them: Whereas he tells them plainly, <hi>It is expedient for you that I go away,</hi> John. 16. 7. It is not only expedient <hi>for me,</hi> but it is expedient <hi>for you?</hi> so that here was no real cause of grief and sorrow. And hence our Saviour puts a stop upon it, <hi>John</hi> 14. 1. <hi>Let not your hearts be troubled,</hi> q d. I see that you misplace your grief, Come it must not be so; I will not have it to be so; lot not your hearts be troubled.</p>
                  <p>Poor <hi>Mary</hi> was greatly at a loss in this particular, she stood <hi>besides the sepulcher of Christ Weeping,</hi> John 11. 20. Why what's the matter? The Body of the Lord is gone. Had she found him dead there, it seems she had been very well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: So that her grief and sorrow was in deed (although she did not understand it, and intend it so) that Christ was Risen. She should have wept over an <hi>unbelieving heart,</hi> (that doubted of the Resurrection of her Saviour) and not over an <hi>empty Grave,</hi> from which his Body was deliver'd; God having <hi>loosed the pains of Death, because it was not possible that he should be holden of it,</hi> Acts 2. 24.</p>
                  <p>I might add other instances, but these may satisfie to clear the point; That we are very subject to misplace our grief, and to mistake the ground and object of our sorrow: And there are two especial causes of it. <hi>viz.</hi> Either because our <hi>understanding is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:65560:161"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 1: Sometimes we are very subject to misplace our grief, <hi>because our understanding is misled.</hi> We do not Judg aright of that, which is indeed the only, or the greatest cause of trouble. Some apprehend their tears are fitter to be spent on their <hi>Afflictions,</hi> then their <hi>sins:</hi> They see no great hurt <hi>in</hi> sin, but they feel much in Affliction; Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is a grievous thing to them; but corruption is not so. There is a principle in Nature which makes a man averse from <hi>penal evil,</hi> but there is none at all, that maketh him averse from <hi>sinful evil:</hi> so that a man needs nothing else but Nature to make him sensible of penal evils of Afflictions, but he needs more then Nature, to make him sensible of sin: And hence it is, because the greater part of men have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but Nature in them, that they are so exceedingly affected with the one, and so regardless of the other.</p>
                  <p>Now these <hi>affections follow apprehensions,</hi> as they always do; They are mistaken in their judgments, and so they misapply their passions: They look upon their sins as small matters, but they amplifie their troubles and afflictions, as he in the <hi>Poet,</hi> I am ten times, twenty times, an hundred times mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; And hence they weep for their afflictions and will not be comforted; while they have not a tear to spend upon their sins; And this in probability was <hi>Israels</hi> case, <hi>Ier.</hi> 30. 15. They were extreamly troubled at the miseries that were upon them, but they were little troubl'd at their sins; They cryed because of their Afflictions; they did not only sigh and mourn and grieve and weep, but more then so they cry'd aloud; which shews extremity of sorrow: But we hear nothing of any sorrow for their sins. And therefore God comes in and interrupts them, why what's the matter with you, can you tell why you take on in this fashion? <hi>Why criest thou for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 words">

                  </p>
                  <p>And so for <hi>penal evils,</hi> they mistake there too; They think that <hi>Temporal Judgments,</hi> are greater and heavier then <hi>spiritual judgments:</hi> They take the <hi>bodily plague,</hi> to be worse then the <hi>plague of the heart: a famine of Corn,</hi> then the <hi>famine of the word;</hi> and so they grieve more for the one, then for the other; and they had rather lose their <hi>Saviour;</hi> then their <hi>

grief, Because our understanding is misled.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The second is, Because our <hi>Affection is misled,</hi> I mean our love; for love is the commander of our other passions: It is the first and great wheel of the soul, that carries all the rest about, and governs them as it pleaseth. Love is the strongest of the passions and Affections, and therefore all the rest yield to it, and are greatly sway'd by it: And by this means it comes to pass, that if we misplace our <hi>Love,</hi> we are in danger to misplace <hi>our sorrow:</hi> For we shall surely grieve for that most, which we love best, whether it be best or not. Oh what a deal of vain unnecessary sorrow, do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny throw themselves into, by misapplying this Affection! Their love is setled where it should not be, or it is stronger then it ought to be, to such a friend, to such a comfort, to such a relation, and when they find a disappointment by the removall, or the change of that which they have set their hearts too much upon, their <hi>grief</hi> is answerable to their <hi>love.</hi> Strong affections (especially when they miscarry in the object of them) do cast men into strong Afflictions.</p>

But alas, he cannot hold till he come thither, but discharges at the stairs as he is going up, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 33. <hi>He wept as he went and said, O my Son</hi> Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salom, <hi>my Son</hi> Absalom, <hi>would God I had died for thee, O</hi> Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salom, <hi>my Son, my Son.</hi> You see then both <hi>that,</hi> and <hi>why,</hi> we are so ready to misplace our grief, and to misapply our sorrow.</p>

                  <p>Beloved, tears if they be shed aright, are precious things; God <hi>puts them up into his Bottle,</hi> as if they were of great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue: And yet some lay them out on nothing: How will they weep, and grieve, at any disappointment in their small affairs, any miscarriage in their business, any little petty loss, any unkindness from their friends, or neighbours, any affront or provocation in the least degree; nay if they be but crossed in their wills, though it be best indeed they should: All their sorrow is bestowed on little trifling incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable things. Why, my beloved, have ye not other manner of things then these to grieve for? what think you of your <hi>own sias,</hi> with all their bloody aggravations? what think you of the <hi>horrible Abominations,</hi> and <hi>woful desolations</hi> of the Land? And of all the wrath of God, that hath been lately manitested and reveal'd from Heaven against us, more ways then I am able to express?

In the first of <hi>Kings</hi> 13. 30. You find a <hi>Prophet</hi> burying a <hi>Prophet,</hi> and melting over him when he Inter'd him; <hi>He laid his Carcase in the Grave and mourned over him, and said alass my Brother!</hi> How solemnly did <hi>Israel</hi> lament the death of <hi>Samuel,</hi> and made their grief as remarkable and publick as their loss, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. 1. It is observed of <hi>Stephen</hi> that he <hi>was carried by devout men to his burial with great la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation,</hi> Acts 8. 2.

Too soon indeed <hi>for you,</hi> but not for him. Is he got home to his Fathers house too soon? Is he with God, and Christ, and Angels, and glorified Saints too soon? What, doth he wish that he were back again with you? Hath he his everlasting Rest too soon? His glorious Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence too soon? Brethren, he wrought a pace you know, while he had strength, and finished the work that God had given him to do betime. So that it is no wonder though he hath his wages early, sooner then such dull heavy Slugs as we are. His life was short indeed, though filled up with Grace and Duty, and God hath made but an exchange of an Eternal one for it. <hi>He</hi> was a <hi>burning and a shining light;</hi> burning with enflamed Affections, till the Oyl was spent, and shining in an exemplary Conversation.

God and Christ, and then he takes away our Beloved com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts from us. And let me tell you, some of you have back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slidden grievously, and sensibly abated of your former Zeal and Holiness, and strictness in the Waies of God: Yea, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>scandalously</hi> to the dishonour of Religion and the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel: This grieved our dear Brother, who will grieve no more now; I had it from his Mouth and Pen, how tenderly he took some late miscarriages, and how near they went to him: These things <hi>brought him low among you,</hi> who was low enough before; and made him to <hi>bewail many who have manifestly sinned, and have not repented,</hi> as the Apostle speaks, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 21. Oh how it wounded him, after so many Labours and so many Sufferings, for your establishment and confirmation; to see such declinations and backslidings. He might have <hi>said</hi> with the Apostle, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3. 8. <hi>Now I live if you stand fast in the Lord, if not I die;</hi> and dead he is.</p>
                  <p>Oh my dear Friends, What have your sins done? What hath your barrenness, and your unfruitfulness, and your back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sliding done? I know you <hi>lov'd him</hi> with a very high affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and have made it to appear in many outward declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to your great praise: But the best way to shew your love to the true Ministers of Christ, <hi>Who seek not yours, but you;</hi> who seek not profit and applause, but Fruit; is to <hi>bear</hi> their just reproofs and to be amended by them; <hi>to hear and obey them</hi> in their regular directions; <hi>to follow</hi> all their good Examples: For the Ministers of Christ are <hi>Samplers</hi> to the flock, and Samplers must be wrought after. And in a word, <hi>to bring</hi> them in the return of all their Labours, in Holiness and holy Walking; that they may <hi>see the travel of their souls and be satisfied.</hi> Nothing but this will satisfie them, and make them <hi>do their work with Joy.</hi> I know you <hi>lov'd him,</hi> as there was cause enough you should; but say in truth, have you <hi>Improv'd him?</hi> I am assur'd that many of you (a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable number) have Improv'd him to the utmost of your power. That you have made the most you could, of his Indefatigable and Incessant pains among you: That you have gather'd up the very Fragments of the Bread of Life, and pick'd up the very Crums, that nothing might be lost. That you have eyed his exemplary Conversation, and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to your pattern. And this I make no question
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65560:165"/>
is no small comfort to you in this doleful day. But have you <hi>all</hi> done this? Are there no secret Stitches at the Hearts of any of you, upon this consideration? He <hi>spent his strength</hi> indeed among you, he wasted and consumed himself, that you might flourish: But tell mee, have there been answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Fruits among you, of Holiness and Obedience? When he Fed you, have you prosper'd? He got a poor lean wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd Body, that you might have fat Souls. And are you all <hi>fat and well liking?</hi> Oh what lean Souls have some of you, who have attended on his Ministry, even to his dying day: How hath your rich and fat Pasture been cast away up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you? So that our Brother might have said (in reference to many) as the Prophet did, I have <hi>spent my strength in vain.</hi> However he <hi>is glorious</hi> with his God. But I am very much afraid that many of you will find this holy <hi>wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> who is now ascended, Witnessing against you, when the day of trial comes.</p>
                  <p>Dear Friends: Be not offended if I tell you, that your sins have had a stroke in the Sickness, and the Weakness, and the death of your deservedly beloved Minister. They were our sins that killed Christ; <hi>He was bruised for our iniquities, and broken for our sins. He bare our sins in his Body on the Tree.</hi> And so they are our sins that kill the Ministers of Christ. You have often seen your Saviour slain before you, by and for your sins. Now you have seen a holy Minister of his, slain by the same hands. And yet your sins live still to do more such work, and the Lord knows where it will end. There is no Execution done upon them, who have done such dreadful Execution in our view. Oh let your hearts break, and your Tears run down, till your Lusts be broken, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, and destroyed; or else they will break you, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy you. If you have any love to Christ, to the Ministers of Christ, or to your Selves, you may see cause enough to weep, though not for our deceased Brother; yet <hi>for your selves,</hi> and for your sins. That's the first thing then, weep <hi>for the sins that you have done.</hi>

them. Even so say I to you my Brethren, with the Apostle, <hi>James</hi> 5. 1. <hi>Go to now, weep and howl, for your miseries that shall come upon you.</hi> Oh let not that complaint of the Prophet, <hi>Isaiah</hi> 57. 1. Be renewed against you, <hi>The Righteous perisheth and no man laieth it to heart, and merciful men are taken away, none considering that the Righteous is taken away from the evil to come.</hi> Our dear Brother now deceased was a Righteous man, yea a Preacher of Righteousness. The Lord you see hath taken him away; Oh what evil is to come! When such as he are hous'd, what dreadful storms may there be like to fall? Brethren, the holy Ministers of God, are the peoples Life-guard, <hi>The Chariots of Israel and the Horsemen thereof,</hi> 2 Kings 13. 14. They are anointed Cherubs that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. They are a Shelter and a Covering from the Storm, and from the Rain. Sometimes they are called <hi>Shepherds;</hi> and the business of a Shepherd is to keep and save the Flock. Sometimes they are called <hi>Angels;</hi> and Angels are the Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians of the Lords people: They Guard, and Cover, and Protect a People.</p>
                  <p>Now this they do while they <hi>instruct</hi> them so to walk, that wrath may not come upon them while they <hi>Intercede</hi> with God, and stand up in the breach, to keep out the Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is flowing in upon it. A praying Minister (and such a one have you lost) one that bare you on his Heart continually before the Lord (as <hi>Aaron</hi> did the names of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> on his Breast-plate) I say a praying Minister, is a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection to the People. Its true, the fervent Prayers of the <hi>meanest Saint,</hi> are an Incredible defence to any place, to save it from the shokes of God. And therefore even they are stiled <hi>Intercessors, Isa.</hi> 59. 16. Because they mediate with God when he is Angry, and by their zealous Supplications hold his hands. But yet however, though it be a certain truth that God hath much respect to the Petitions of his weakest Servants, yea though perhaps some private Christians may <hi>Excel</hi> a holy Minister in Prayer; yet God hath more regard to the Intreaties of his faithful Ministers, who have a special Charge, and commission to be his <hi>Remembrancers</hi> for the good of that People, which he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> to their charge; and their Petitions are of more avail and power with God both to <hi>Procure</hi> his Blessings, and <hi>avert</hi> his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

                     <hi>Moses and Aaron among the Priests, and Samuel among them that call on his Name: They called upon the Lord, and he answered them,</hi> Psal. 99. 6. Why doubtless, so he heard the Prayers of his other Saints. But these his holy <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Prophets</hi> had the Ear of God (as special Favourites have their Princes Ears) and could be Heard and Answered, when others were denied Access and Audience. And this is not obseurely Intimated in that Protestation of the Lord to <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> concerning their approaching Desolation, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14. 14. <hi>Though these three men,</hi> Noah, Daniel, <hi>and</hi> Job <hi>were in it, they should deliver but their own souls.</hi> By which, he insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates, that when the absolute Decree is once gone forth, it can by no means be revok'd; so he suggests withal, that if it had been feasible, these holy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Oh how did <hi>Moses</hi> stand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, and bind the Hands of the Almighty, when he was about to strike. So that the Lord intreats and flatters with him <hi>to let him alone,</hi> Exod. 32. 10. While such as <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> are Intercessors for a People, God forbears, he holds his Hands, and restrains his Indignation; as he that means to strike, observes what strength there will be likely to oppose him: And when he looks and sees, that <hi>there is no Interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor,</hi> then he goes on with his design, <hi>Isa.</hi> 59. 16. <hi>Then his Arm brings Salvation to him, and he puts on the Garments of Vengeance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Brethren, you are in greater danger then you are aware, by the removal of your Praying Minister: For you have lost one Intercessor, if any breach should happen between God and you. Yea, you have lost your Covering, if a storm of Wrath should fall. So that it may be said of you, as it was once of <hi>Israel</hi> when <hi>Moses</hi> was a way, that you <hi>are naked;</hi> And what, are you in <hi>Laodicea's</hi> case indeed? Do you <hi>not know that you are naked?</hi> Are you naked and are you not afraid? Are you naked and not ashamed? This would become a state of Innocence indeed; in which it was observed of <hi>Adam</hi> and his Wife, that <hi>they were both naked, and were not</hi>

Have you no sense and feeling of it? Especially at such a time as this, when the Judgments of the Lord are abroad upon the Earth, upon the Land, upon this very place in which you live, more waies then I am able to express. Alas, alas, you are uncovered, whether you know it yea or no. And it is perhaps some mercy, that you are not quite uncovered. Here spend your Tears, and you shall not misplace your sorrow. That is the first branch of Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; <hi>weep for your selves:</hi> For the <hi>sins</hi> that you have done, and for the <hi>Judgments</hi> that you may be like to suffer.</p>

It was his very last design (As he was alwaies full of holy Projects) to take some Course, that Children might be more generall Principled in the Grounds and Fundamentals of Religiony then they are. And I am very well assured, that many of your Children, have such Liquor poured into them by his means, that they will relish of it as long as they have a day to live, and it may be bless the Lord and him for it, to all Eternity.
