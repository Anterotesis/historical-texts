         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE,
Containing
The Plat-form and Designe,
of the Discourse.</head>
            <p>THere is nothing more nice
and delicate, than to Treat
on the Subject of <hi>Women.</hi>
When a Man speaketh to
their advantage, it is presently
imagined a peece of Gallantry, or
Love: And it is very probable, that
the most part Judging of this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
by the Title, will take it at
first for an effect of the one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<pb facs="tcp:103324:4"/>
and will be glad to know the
truth of the motive and designe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
Take it thus:</p>
            <p>The most happy thought, that
can enter into the minds of those
who labour, to acquire a solid
Science, after that they have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed,
according to the Vulgar
Method, is to doubt if they have
been taught aright, and to desire
to discover the truth by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
            <p>In the progress of their inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
it occurs to them necessarily, to
observe that we are filled with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices,
(that is to say, opinions past
upon things without true Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation);
And that we must abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
Renounce them, to attain
to clear, and distinct Knowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</p>
            <p>In the designe of insinuating so
important a Maxime, we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
<pb facs="tcp:103324:4"/>
it the best, to choose a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate,
and famous Subject,
where every one takes an interest; to
the end, that having demonstrated,
that a Sentiment as ancient as the
World, of as great extent as the
Earth, and as Universal as Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
is a prejudice or errour,
the Learned might at length, be
Convinced of the necessity of
Judging of things by themselves
after having examined them, and
not to referre themselves to the
opinion or credit of other men;
if they would avoid being decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
            <p>Of all prejudices, there is not any
to be observed, more proper for
this designe, than that which men
commonly conceive of the inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the two Sexes.</p>
            <p>Indeed, if we consider them in
their present condition, we may
<pb facs="tcp:103324:5"/>
observe them more different in their
civil functions, and those which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
on the mind, than in such
as belong to the body. And if
we search for the reason of this in
ordinary discourse, we find, that all
the World, those that have Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and those that have none, and
even <hi>Women</hi> themselves agree,
to say, that they have no share in
Sciences nor Employments, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that they are not capable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
that they have not the parts of
men, and that they ought in all
things to be inferiour to them as
they are.</p>
            <p>After having tryed this opinion,
according to the Rule of Verity,
which is to admit of nothing for
truth, but what is supported by
clear, and distinct Notions; On
the one hand it hath appeared false,
and grounded on a prejudice, and
Popular tradition; and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:103324:5"/>
we have found that both Sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
are equal; that is to say, that <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>
are as noble, as perfect, and as
capable as men. This cannot be
established, but by refuting two
sorts of adversaries; the vulgar, and
almost all the learned.</p>
            <p>The former having no other
ground for what they believe, but
Custome; and some slight appearen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
the best way to confute them,
seems to be, to let them see how
that <hi>Women</hi> have been Subjected,
and excluded from Sciences, and
Employments; and having led them
through the Principal conditions,
and occurrences of life, give them
occasion to acknowledge, that <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>
have advantages which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
them equal to men; and
this is the designe of the first
part of this Treatise.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:103324:6"/>
The second is employed to shew,
that all the arguments of the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
are vain. And having esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
the Sentiment of equality,
by positive reasons, <hi>Women</hi> are
Justified from the defects of which
they are ordinarily accused, by
making appear that they are either
imaginary, or of little importance;
that they proceed only from the
education which is given them,
and that they mark in them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
advantages.</p>
            <p>This Subject might be handled
two wayes, either in a flourishing,
brisk; and complementive Stile,
or otherwayes after the manner of
Philosophers by Principles, to the
end of being instructed therein to
the bottom.</p>
            <p>Such as have the true idea of
eloquence, know well that these
two stiles are almost inconsistent
<pb facs="tcp:103324:6"/>
together, and that one cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten
the mind, and tickle it by
the same Methode. It is not but
that the flourish may be joyned with
reason; but that such a mixture oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
hinders the end which ought to
be proposed in discourse, which is to
convince, and perswade, that which
is pleasing, musing the mind, and
not suffering it to rest on what is
solid.</p>
            <p>And as men have peculiar re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards
for <hi>Women,</hi> if in a treatise
made on their Subject, we mingle
any thing that is gallant and court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
those that read it, pursue their
thoughts too far, and lose sight of
that which ought chiefly to affect
them.</p>
            <p>Wherefore there being nothing
in the World that concerns
<hi>Women</hi> more than this designe,
where we are obliged to speak in
their favour, matters of the greatest
<pb facs="tcp:103324:7"/>
force, and verity, as far as the
capriciousness of the World can suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
it; we thought that it behooved
us to speak seriously, and give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
thereof, lest that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
that it might be a peece of
airy Gallantry, should make it slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perused, or rejected by scrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
persons.</p>
            <p>We are not ignorant, that this
discourse will render a great many
male contented, and that they whose
Interests and Maximes are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to what is proposed here, will
not fail to cry out against it. To give
means to answer to their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints,
we advertise persons of
Spirit, and particularly the <hi>Women</hi>
who are not the Spaniels of those
that take authority over them, that
if they give themselves the trouble
to read this Treatise, with the
attention at least that the variety
of matters therein contained does
<pb facs="tcp:103324:7"/>
require, they will observe that the
Essential Character of truth, is
clearness, and evidence, Which
may serve them to know whether
the objections that may be adduced
against them be considerable or not.</p>
            <p>And they may remark, that the
most specious shall be made to
them by people whose profession
seems at this day to engage them
to renounce experience, common
sense, and themselves, that they
may blindly embrace all that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
with their prejudices, and
interests, and oppugne all kinds of
Truths that seem to oppose
them.</p>
            <p>And we pray consider, that
the bad effects, which a panick
fear may make them apprehend from
this enterprise, may never perhaps
happen in one single <hi>Woman,</hi> and
that they are counterpoised with
<pb facs="tcp:103324:8"/>
a great advantage, which may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound
there-from; there being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
no way more natural, or sure,
to draw the greatest part of <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>
from idleness, to which they
are reduced, and the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
that attend it, than to
perswade them to study, which
is almost the sole thing in which
Ladies at present can imploy
themselves, by making them know
that they are as proper thereto as
men.</p>
            <p>And as there are none but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable
men, who abuse the
advantages that custome hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
them, to the prejudice of
<hi>Women;</hi> neither can there be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
any, but indiscreet <hi>Women,</hi>
that should make use of this peece,
to make them rise against men, who
would treat them as their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
and equals. In fine, if any
one be Choaked with this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
<pb facs="tcp:103324:8"/>
for what reason soever it be,
let him quarrel with Truth, and
not the Author: and to free him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
from peevishness, let him say
to himself, that it is but an Essay of
wit: it is certain, that this jurk of
imagination or a like, hindering
truth from gaining upon us, renders
it much less uneasie to those who
have pain to suffer it.</p>

TRANSLATOR
TO THE
Unprejudiced Reader.</head>
            <p>I Well fore-see, that my pains, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
this ingenious <hi>French Author</hi>
speak <hi>English,</hi> will, according to the
bias of prejudiced, and interested
humours, undergoe various Censures; a
great many men, especially those who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the <hi>French,</hi> with their Shop-tooles,
will be at it Tooth and Nail, and cry out,
that so many out-landish Trinckioms ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
already crept into use amongst the
<hi>Women;</hi> he that would endeavour to
introduce more, is no friend to the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of the Subject. But such men do
<pb facs="tcp:103324:10"/>
but hunt their own shadow; my intent
by this Translation being quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
            <p>When I Considered, that of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
The <hi>English</hi> did most candidly
assert, and sutably entertain the worth
of the lovely Sex; and by civility, and
good nature, as well as prudence, and
justice, freely grant an equality to <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
in all things wherein established,
and unalterable customes might not be
violated; which strangers, even the <hi>French</hi>
themselves, the great complimenters of
that Sex, do by the force of <hi>Philosophy,</hi>
and with reasons which wrestle against
prejudices, but at most discourse of. I
thought I could not do less for the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
of such <hi>English Men,</hi> who do
not understand my <hi>Author</hi> in his own
Language, than to make him intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and so give them opportunity to infer
from his opinions; that what in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the <hi>Virtuosi,</hi> and enquirers of that
Nation, Squeeze from subtile Speculation,
and Logick, is no more than what eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>English Man</hi> Practiseth by common
sense, and Natural inclination. And
herein I hope not at all to have offended
that Sex.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:103324:10"/>
I think I have no great reason to
apprehend ill will from the <hi>Vertuous
Women,</hi> for my endeavours of letting
them hear strangers speak in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours;
since they may Lawfully conclude
from thence, that if they enjoy more than
their Neighbours of what is their acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
due, it must be their peculiar advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
beyond others, that makes them more
considerable in the eyes of their Iudges:
there being no Countrey which produceth
<hi>Women,</hi> who ought more Iustly to boast
of the favours, and endowments of nature,
in respect of body and mind, than this;
or who more fully enjoy, or modestly
use the priviledges which upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
are reasonably allowed them.</p>
            <p>This I conceive may be sufficient to
warrant my undertakeing, especially see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so candid a peece of <hi>Philosophy,</hi>
may in a great measure vindicate the
honour of the Nation, (which much grieves
to be imposed upon by the modes, and
punctilio's of the <hi>French</hi> so much in fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
by letting the world see, that the
<hi>English,</hi> Nobly complying with that Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
which is therein so strongly pleaded
for; do in matters of importance give
<pb facs="tcp:103324:11"/>
an Example so truly Imitable, that the
more ingenious must impute it to Salick
Lawes, long Custome, masculine, and harsh
constitutions, that they are not Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
proposed as patterns.</p>
            <p>It is not my province to attempt the
answering of objections, which may be
made against this kind of <hi>Doctrine;</hi>
both since my <hi>Author,</hi> whose task it was,
hath fully done it; and that there is no
great danger of inconveniencies, here to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
that which is already believed and
put in practice. And therefore, if any
corrupt minded sales-man, who may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to know <hi>Women</hi> better than either
the <hi>Author</hi> or my self, because he hath
seen more in their Bodices, shall unlace
and let flie a dotument, and tell me that
in this medling generation I have been
a little too pragmatical to follow the
steps of a stranger, and tread upon snailes
when they show their hornes; I am so
innocent as not to reply, but leave him
in his chafe, to be convinced by reason,
and a good wife: and speak a word to
the impartial reader by way of advertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
concerning the Treatise.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:103324:11"/>
The <hi>Author</hi> himself gives his Reason,
why he hath handled this Subject in so
serious a manner, and in so short, and
<hi>Doctrinal</hi> a stile: So that I need say no
more, but as a faithfull Translator, I have
stuck to his words, and sense. I resolved
indeed to have accommodated this Treatise
as much as possibly I could to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and present customes of this nation;
but finding therein, somethings whereon
the <hi>Author</hi> does insist as material to the
establishing of his opinion, which are not
well known in this Kingdome, there being no
order of People, nor publick houses here,
which in every thing runs Parallel with
NVNS, ABBESSE, and MONS AS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TERIES,
but especially with those whom
he mentions: I thought it convenient to
translaete his words Literally, and for the
understanding of one passage, which may
seem difficult, advertise the Reader, that
there is an order of <hi>Nuns</hi> at Paris, who,
because they make it their business to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
and supply prisoners, and other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digent
persons, have the name of <hi>Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi>
and that in the great Hospital the
<hi>L'Hostel dieu</hi> there, which is indeed a
great Theatre of Humane infirmities; all
<pb facs="tcp:103324:12"/>
the sick, are attended by Religious <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi>
If the Reader be herewith satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
I have my designe; and if not,
I shall not, I hope, lose the name of a

their Assurance is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
onely upon slight
Appearances, by which
they suffer themselves to be hurried:
and would have as strongly believed the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:103324:14"/>
contrary, if the Impressions of Sense or

after the same manner.</p>
            <p>Setting aside a small number of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
all the world hold, as a thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable,
That the Sun moves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Earth: Though that which
appears in the Revolution of Dayes,
and Years, equally inclineth those
(who attentively consider) to think,
That it is the Earth that takes its course
round the Sun. Men Imagine, that in
Beasts, there is a certain Knowledge
that guides them, by the same reason
that wild Savages fancy, some little
Spirits to be within Clocks, and other
Engines which are shown them; where
of they understand not the Fabrick, or
Movements.</p>
            <p>Had we been brought up in the midst
of the Seas, without having ever come
Ashore, we should not have failed, to
have believed (as Children do when
they put off in Boats), that in our
Floating-houses, the Land went from us.
Every one esteems his own Countrey
the best, because there he is most ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed;
and that the Religion,
wherein he hath been Nursed, is the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:103324:14"/>
True, which he ought to follow; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he hath never perhaps dream'd
of examining, or comparing the same
with others. VVe find our selves al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
more inclined for our Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
than for Strangers, even in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
where Right is on their side. VVe
are more pleased to Converse with
those of our own Profession, than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
though neither their VVit, nor
Vertue, be so great. And the Disparity
of Estates and Conditions, make many
judge, that Men amongst themselves are
altogether unequal.</p>
            <p>If we enquire into the ground of all
these diverse Opinions, we shall find them
bottom'd on Interest, or Custom; and
that it is incomparably more difficult,
to draw Men from such Sentiments,
wherein they are engaged by Prejudice,
than from the Opinions which they
have embraced upon the Motive of the
strongest, and most convincing Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>Amongst these odd Opinions, we
may reckon the common Judgment
which Men make of the Difference of
the two Sexes, and of all that depends
thereon; there is not any mistake more
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103324:15"/>
Antient, or Universal. For, both
the Knowing and Ignorant, are so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possessed
with the Opoinion, That Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
are inferiour to Men in Capacity
and Worth, and that they ought to be
placed in that dependance wherein we
see them; that the contrary Sentence
will not miss to be eyed, as a Paradox,
and piece of Singularity.</p>
            <p>However, for the Establishing of it,
it would not at all be necessary, to use
any positive Reason; if Men were more
just, and less interested in their Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
it might suffice to advertise
them, That hitherto the difference of
the Sexes (to the disadvantage of the
Female), hath been but very lightly
discoursed off; and that to judge sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
whether our Sex have obtained
any Natural Pre-eminence beyond
theirs: we ought to think thereon se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously,
and without Partiality, reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all which hath been hitherto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
upon the simple Report of other
Men, without Tryal, or Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>It is certain, that if a Man would set
himself in this State of Indifferency,
and Neutrality, he must acknowledge
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:103324:15"/>
(on the one hand) that it is Weakness
and Precipitancy that make us reckon
Women less Noble and Excellent, than
our selves: and that certain Natural
Indispositions render them obnoxious
to the Failings, and Imperfections
that are attributed to them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
contemptible to many. And, on
the other hand, he must see, That these
very Colours which cheat People con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
their own Subjects, when they
slightly pass them over, would serve
to undeceive them, if they sounded
them a little deeper. In short, if that
Man were a Philosopher, he would
find that there are Natural Reasons,
which invincibly prove, that both Sexes
are a like, both as to Body, and
Soul.</p>
            <p>But as there are not many Persons,
in a condition of themselves, to put in
Practice this Advice; so it must remain
useless, without some pains be taken
to labour with Men, and to put them in
the way of making use of it. And see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Opinion of those who have less
studied is the most general, with it we
shall begin our Enquiry.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:103324:16"/>
Let every Man (in particular) be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
his Thoughts of Women (in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral)
and that he would surely confess his
Mind; he will tell you without doubt,
That they were not made but for Man;
That they are fit for nothing, but to
Nurse, and Breed little Children in their
Low Age; and to mind the House.
It may be the more Ingenious will add,
That there are many Women that have
indeed Parts, and Conduct; but that
even they who seem to have most, when
they are nearly examined, discover
still some-what that speaks their Sex:
That they have neither Solidity, nor
Constancy; nor that depth of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which they think to find in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
And that it hath been an Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of Divine Providence, and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Men, to have barred them from
Sciences, Government, and Offices:
That it would be a pleasant thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
to see a Lady in the Chair (in
quality of a Professor) teaching <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorick,</hi>
or <hi>Medicine;</hi> marching along
the Streets, followed by Officers, and
Sergeants; putting in Execution Laws:
Playing the part of a Counsellour;
pleading before Judges: Seated on a
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103324:16"/>
Bench, to Administer Justice in Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Courts: Leading of an Army;
giving Battel; and Speaking before
States, and Princes, as the Head of an
Embassy.</p>
            <p>I do confess, such Practices would
surprize us; but for no other reason,
but that of Novelty. For, if in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delling
of States, and establishing the
different Offices that compose them,
Women had been like-wise called to
Functions; we should have been as
much accustomed to have seen them in
Dignity, as they are to see us. And
should have found it no more strange to
have seen a Lady on a Throne, than a
Woman in a Shop.</p>
            <p>If these Blades be pressed a little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
we shall find their mightiest Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
reduced to this, That, as to
Women, matters have alwayes past as
now they go; which is a mark, that
they are really such, as they are esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
And that, if they had been ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of Sciencies, and Offices, Men
would not have denyed them their
shares.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:103324:17"/>
These kind of Reasonings proceed
from the Conceit that we have of the
Equity of our Sex; and a false Notion
which Men forge to themselves of
Custom: It is enough with them to find
that a thing is established, to make them
believe it well grounded. And as they
judge, that men ought to do nothing
without Reason; so the most part of
People cannot imagine, but that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
hath been consulted for the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
of such Practises, as they see
universally received; and fancy to
themselves, that Prudence, and right
Reason, have established the Customes,
to which they both oblige us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme;
since, without breach of Order,
we cannot therein dispence with our
Obedience.</p>
            <p>Every one sees (in his own Countrey)
the Women in such Subjection, that,
in all things, they depend on Men,
without being admitted to Learning;
or any of those Conditions, that afford
opportunity to become remarkable by
the advantage Parts: No Body affirms,
that he hath ever seen them treated o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-wise.
And all know, That mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
go so with them every where, that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:103324:17"/>
there is no place in the World, where
they are not used after the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
as we find at Home. In some
Countries their Usage is worse, where
they are regarded as Slaves. In <hi>China</hi>
they keep their Feet little from their
Child-hood, to hinder them from ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
out of Doors; where they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
see any thing but their Husbands,
and Children. In <hi>Turkey</hi> the Ladies
are strictly enough confined; And in
<hi>Italy</hi> they are not much better. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
all the People of <hi>Asia, Affrica,</hi>
and <hi>America,</hi> use their Wives, as we
do our Serving-Maids. They are no
where imployed in any thing, but that
which is esteemed low, and base: And
because they only discharge the lesser
care of Hus-wivery and Nurses, Men
commonly perswade themselves, that,
for that end alone they are in the
World; and that they are uncapable
of any thing else: They cannot easily
represent to themselves how matters
could be other-wayes; it appearing
impossible to alter them, what endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
soever be used.</p>
            <p>The wisest Law-givers in founding
their Common-Wealths have establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:103324:18"/>
nothing on this Account, in favour
of Women. All their Laws seem only
to have been made to confirm Men in
the Possession they have got. Most
part of Men, who have passed for
Learned, have not said any thing to the
advantage of Women: And the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of Men, in all Ages, and Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the World, appears so uniform
in this case, that it seems they have
conspired; or other-wayes (as many
imagine) have been led thereunto by
a secret Instinct; that is to say, Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters-Patent
from the Author of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>Men are still the more perswaded in
this, when they consider in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
the Women (themselves) support
this their Condition. They look upon
it as a thing natural to them; whether
it be that they reflect not upon what
they are; or that being born, and bred
in dependence, they make the same
Judgment thereon, as Men do. Now,
upon all these views, the one, and the
other, let themselves believe, both,
That their Spirits are as different as
their Bodies; and that there ought to
be as great distinction betwixt the two
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:103324:18"/>
Sexes, in all the Functions of Life, as
there is in those which are peculiar to
either: Whil'st, in the mean-time,
that perswasion (like the most part of
those which we draw from Use, and
Custom,) is nothing but Prejudice,
formed in us by the appearances of
things, for want of closer Examination;
and of which we might easily undeceive
our selves, if we would but take the
pains to return back to the Fountain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
and judge in many Occurrencies
of that which hath been done in former
times, by what is practised at this day;
and of the Custom of the Antients, by
what we see in Vogue in our own
times: Had Men followed this Rule
in many of their Sentiments, they had
not so easily fallen into mistakes. And
as to what concerns the present state of
Women, they would have acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
that they have not been subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by any other Law, than that of the
stronger; and that it hath not been
for want of Natural Capacity, or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
that they have not shared with
us in that which raises our Sex above
theirs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:103324:19"/>
Indeed, when we consider seriously
the Affairs of this World, both past,
and present, we find that all agree in
this, That Reason hath alwayes been
the weakest: And it seems, that Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories
have only been composed, to
Demonstrate that which every one
sees in his own time, That ever since
there hath been Men in the World,
force hath alwayes prevailed. The
greatest Empires of <hi>Asia,</hi> in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings,
have been the work of Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
and Thieves. And the scattered
Wracks of the <hi>Grecian,</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies,
have not been gathered, but
by those who thought themselves
strong enough to resist their Masters,
and domineer over their Equals. This
Conduct is no less visible in all other
Societies. And if Men behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
so towards their Fellows, there
is great likely-hood from stronger Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
That, in the beginning, they have
done so, every one towards his Wife.
And this is almost the manner how it
hath happened.</p>
            <p>Men observing, that they were: the
stronger, and that in relation of Sex,
they had some advantage of Body,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:103324:19"/>
fancyed that they had the same in all;
the Consequence was not great for
Women in the beginning of the World,
Affairs being in a Condition far diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
from what now they are: when
neither Government, Science, Office,
nor Religion, were established, the
Notion of Dependence had in it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all of Irksome. I Imagine that
Men lived then like little Children,
and all the Advantage that was, was
like that of Play. Men and Women
(who then were simple, and innocent)
were equally employed in labouring of
the Land, or Hunting, (as the Wild
<hi>Indians</hi> do at this day): The Man took
his Course and the Woman her's;
And they that brought Home most
Profit, were commonly most esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>The Inconveniencies that attend and
follow the big-Belly, weakening the
Strength of the Female for some Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venal
of time, and hindering them to
labour as formerly, required (neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily)
the Assistance of their Husbands;
and the more still, whil'st they were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up with the care of their young
Children. This produced some Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:103324:20"/>
of Esteem, and Preferrence in
Families, which then were only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
of Father, Mother, and some
little Babes: But when Families be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to be enlarged; and that in the same
House, lived not only the Father, but
the Father's Mother, the Children's
Children; with Brothers, and Sisters,
Elder and younger: Then did Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
dilate it self, and become more
sensible: Then was to be seen, the
Mistriss submitting to her Husband, the
Son honouring his Father, and he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
his Children. And as it is
most difficult for Brothers, alwayes,
perfectly to agree; we may easily
conceive, that they lived not long to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
before that some Difference
hapned amongst them: The Elder,
stronger than the rest, would conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
to them in nothing: So, Force
obliged the Lesser to bow under the
Greater, and the Daughters to
follow the Example of their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>It is easie to be imagined, that in such
Families, there were then several dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Functions; That the Women,
being bound to stay at Home to bring
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:103324:20"/>
up their Children, took the Care with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
Doors: The Men (more free and
strong) charged themselves with the
Affairs abroad; and that after the
Death of the Father and Mother, the
First-Born took upon him the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
The Daughters, accustomed
to the House, had no thoughts of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
abroad; but some Younger Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
discontented, and more fierce
than they, refusing to submit to the
Yoak, were obliged to withdraw, and
set up for themselves: And so, seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
of the same Humour meeting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
made a shift to live on their
Fortunes, and easily contracted Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship:
VVho, finding themselves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Estate, sought out means to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
what they wanted: and seeing
there was no other way but to take
from their Neighbours, they fell upon
that which came next to hand: And,
to confirm themselves in the Possession
of their New Conquests, at the same
time made themselves Masters of the
owners.</p>
            <p>The voluntary Dependence, which
was before in Families, ceased by this
Invasion; Fathers and Mothers, with
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:103324:21"/>
their Children, being constrained to
obey an unjust Usurper: So that, the
Condition of VVomen became harder
than before. For, as till then, they
had never been marryed but to Men of
their own House, and Family; they
were afterward forced to take Strangers,
and unknown Husbands, who only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
them as the loveliest part of their
Booty.</p>
            <p>It is ordinary with Conquerours, to
despise those amongst the Subdued,
whom they judge the weakest: And
the Women appearing to be such, by
reason of their Employments (which
required not much Strength), were
looked upon as inferiour to Men.</p>
            <p>Some there were who contented
themselves with this first Usurpation;
but others, more ambitious, (encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
by the success of their Victory)
resolved to proceed in their Conquests.
The VVomen being more humane,
than to serve such unjust Designes,
were left at Home; and the Men cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
as the most proper for such Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes,
where there is need of Force.
In this state of Life matters being no
other-wayes esteemed, but as Men
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:103324:21"/>
thought them useful to the ends which
they proposed; and the desire of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
being now become the strongest
of Passions, which could not be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
but by Violence, and Injustice;
of which, men were the only Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
It is no wonder that they were
preferred to Women. Men like-wise,
serving to maintain the Conquests
which they had made: Their Counsels
were only taken for to establish
their Tyranny, because none so fit
to put them in Execution. And so,
the Mildness, and Humanity of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
was the sole cause which exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
them from having any share in
the Administration of Publick Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>The Example of Princes was quickly
imitated by their Subjects, every one
would carry it over his Companion;
and private men began to rule more
absolutely in their Families. So soon
as a Lord found himself Master of a
People, and considerable Countrey,
he shaped it into a Kingdom, made
Laws for Government, chose his
Officers from amongst the Men; and
raised to Places those who had best ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:103324:22"/>
him in his Enterprizes. So notable
a Preferrence of one Sex above the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
lessened still more the Esteem for
the VVomen; and their Humour
and Course of Life, being far from
Butchery, and VVarr; Men believed
them no other-wayes capable to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
to the Safety and Preservation
of Kingdomes, but only by helping to
people them.</p>
            <p>States and Common-VVealths could
not be established, without the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of some Distinction amongst those
that did compose them: So Marks
of Honour were introduced for distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing
of Orders, and Signes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
invented to testifie the Difference,
which was acknowledged to be amongst
Men. And to the Notion of Power,
was added the External Submission,
which is commonly rendred to those
who have the Authority in their
Hands.</p>
            <p>It is not at all necessary to tell you,
how <hi>God</hi> hath been known of Men;
but it is certain, that since the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the VVorld, he hath been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored
by them; though the VVorship
which Men have rendred to a <hi>Deity</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:103324:22"/>
was never Regular, but since they were
assembled in Bodies to make up Publick
Societies.</p>
            <p>Now, as Men were accustomed to
Reverence the Powers, by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Marks of Respect; they
thought it like-wise their Duty,
to Reverence <hi>God</hi> by some Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
which might serve to manifest
the Sentiments which they entertained
of his Greatness. Temples were built,
Sacrifices appointed, and Men (who
were already the Heads of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
failed not also, to take to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
the care of that which concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Religion. And Custom having
now prepossessed the VVomen with an
Opinion that all belonged to Men, they
contentented themselves without aspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to any part of the Publick Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
But the <hi>Idea</hi> which Men conceived
of a <hi>God-Head,</hi> being extreamly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
by the Fables and Fictions of
Poets, they forged to themselves Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinities,
both Male and Female; and
appointed, Shee-<hi>Priests</hi> for the Service
of those of their Sex; but still with Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bordination
to the Conduct, and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of their <hi>Priests.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:103324:23"/>
               <hi>Women</hi> have been likewise known to
have Governed great States; but we
must not imagine, that it was because
they have been called thereto out of
a purpose of Restitution of their right;
but because they had the Dexterity so
to dispose of Affairs, that <hi>Men</hi> could
not snatch the Authority out of their
Hands.</p>
            <p>It is true, there are at this day He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary
States, where the <hi>Females</hi>
succeed to <hi>Males,</hi> as Queens, or Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses;
But we have no Reason to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
but that if <hi>Men</hi> have suffered
the Scepter to fall into the place of the
Distaffe, it was only that they might
prevent the People from falling together
by the Ears; And that, if they have permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Female</hi> Regencies, it was in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,
that the Mothers (who
alwayes extreamly love their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren)
would take a more particular
Care of their States during their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority.</p>
            <p>So that, now the <hi>Women</hi> being no
other-wayes imployed, but in their
Huswivery, and finding therin busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
enough; let us not think it
strange, that they have not invented
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:103324:23"/>
any of these Sciences; whereof the
greatest part (at first) have been but the
work, and task of some idle Loyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Aegyptian Priests</hi> (who had not
much to do) busied themselves in chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
together, concerning the Effects of
Nature, which seemed most to touch
them: And after much talking and
reasoning, began to make Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
the noise of which, stirred up
the Curiosity of some <hi>Men</hi> to come in
search of them: But Sciences being
but then in the Cradle, did not allure
the <hi>Women</hi> out of Doors. Besides,
that the Jealousie which already im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broyled
the Husbands would have fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
them with Suspition, that their
Wives had gone to visit the <hi>Priests</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rather
for Love to their Persons,
than Learning which they had obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>After that several <hi>Men</hi> had received
some tincture of this new Learning,
they began to assemble themselves in
certain Places, to discourse thereof
more at leisure; where every one
speaking his Thoughts, Knowledge ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened,
and Colledges and Accademies
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:103324:24"/>
were appointed, where the <hi>Women</hi>
were not admitted; but in the same
manner were excluded from Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
as they had been from all the
rest.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding, the Restraint where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they were kept, hindred not, but
that some of them procured the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
and Writings of the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
whereby (in a short time) they
equalled the progress of the most In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious:
But Custome having already
enjoyned an impertinent <hi>Decorum,</hi> that
<hi>Men</hi> durst not come to their Houses,
nor other <hi>Women</hi> visit them for fear of
giving some umbrage, they made no
Disciples, nor founded Sects; but all
the Light which they had attained, use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly,
dyed with themselves.</p>
            <p>If we observe how Modes and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shions
creep into use, and how they
are dayly imbelished, we may judge,
That (in the beginning of the World)
People took no great care of their
Dress: All was then simple and plain,
nothing minded but necessity. <hi>Men</hi>
flea'd Beasts; and fastening their Skins
together, framed to themselves Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits.
But afterwards, Commodious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:103324:24"/>
began to be devised; and every
one accowtering themselves according
to their fancy, the Fashions that were
most decent, were presently followed;
and they that were under the same
Prince, strove to conform themselves to
his Mode.</p>
            <p>It happened not so with Modes and
Fashions, as with Governments and
Sciences; the <hi>Women</hi> here had their
Share with <hi>Men:</hi> who perceiving
them by their dress more lovely, took
no care to rob them thereof. And both
the one, and the other, finding that
some sort of Apparel set off more
gracefully, and rendred more amiable
the Person, both strove to find out the
Knack: But the Employments of <hi>Men</hi>
being greater, and more important,
hindered them from the more eager Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Women</hi> herein shewed their Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and Skill; For, observing that
new Ornaments made them more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable,
and dear to <hi>Men,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
their Condition more supportable;
they neglected nothing which they
thought might serve to render them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
Charming, and Lovely. To that
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:103324:25"/>
end, they employed Gold, Silver, and
Precious Stones, as soon as they grew
in Vogue: And seeing that <hi>Men</hi> had
deprived them of Means, to make
themselves Conspicuous by their Parts,
they applyed themselves solely to find
out that which might render them
amiable, and pleasing. In this they
have very well succeeded: For, their
Beauty, and Attire, have advanced
them to greater Esteem in the Eyes
of <hi>Men,</hi> than all the Books and Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the World could ever have
done. This Custom hath been too
well Established, to admit of any fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Change; the Practice thereof,
hath continued to our times; and it
seems to be a Tradition too anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to be now contradicted, or oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</p>
            <p>It appears clearly (from this Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
Conjecture), That, according to
the manner of dealing familiar to all
<hi>Men,</hi> it is only by Force and Empire
that they have reserved to themselves
these Extrinseral Advantages; from
which, the Female Sex is debarred.
For, to warrant them to say, That it
hath been grounded on Reason, they
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:103324:25"/>
must never have communicated them
amongst themselves, but to those who
have been most capable; Alwayes
made the Choice of such with exact
Scrutiny, and Discretion: Never have
admitted to study, but such as they
knew disposed for Letters: Never
raised to Charges, but those that
were fittest for Employment; and
excluded all others. And, in short, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have set any <hi>Man,</hi> on any thing,
but what was suitable to his Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>We see the contrary daily put in
Practice; For, there is nothing but
Chance, Necessity, or Interest, which
engageth <hi>Men</hi> in the different Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
and States of Civil Society.
The Children learn their Father's
Trade, because that it hath alwayes
been mentioned to them. One is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to the Gown, who would have
been better pleased with the Sword,
had it been at his own choice: and
the ablest <hi>Man</hi> in the World shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
enter into Employment, if he want
Money to buy his Place.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:103324:26"/>
How many are there groveling in
the dust, who would have made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
famous, had they been but in
the way? and how many Clowns are
there, that might have become great
Doctors had they been sent to School?
We have but little ground to pretend
that the present <hi>Virtuosi</hi> are only such
of the times, who have had the best
Genius for the things wherein they
excell; and that, amongst so many Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
buryed in Ignorance, there are
none who, with the same means which
they have had, could have rendered
themselves more capable.</p>
            <p>Why is it then, that we assure our
selves, that Women are less fit for such
things than our selves? sure it is not
Chance, but Unavoidable necessity that
hinders them from playing their parts.
I urge not, that all Women are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of all Sciences and Employments;
that any one is capable of all: No <hi>Man</hi>
pretends to so much; but I only desire,
that, considering the Sex in general,
we may acknowledge an aptitude in the
one as well as the other.</p>
            <p>Let us but glance a little upon that,
which we see dayly in the play and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:103324:26"/>
smaller divertisements of Children.
The Girles show therein a more gentile
air, more of Wit, and greater dexteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
And when fear or shame does not
stifle their Humours, their Discourse,
is more ingenious, and pleasant; and
their conversation more lively, brisk,
and free: They Learn sooner what
they are taught, if they be equally
plyed: They are more industrious,
more painfull, more submiss, more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest,
and more reserved; In a word,
we may remarke in them in a more
eminent degree, all those excellent qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
which being found in young
Men, make them esteemed fitter for
high matters, than those who are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
their equalls.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding that, that which
appeares, in the two Sexes, whilst they
are as yet in the cradle, is sufficient
to make us conclude, that the more
lovely gives also the fairest hopes;
yet men take no notice thereof; Masters
and Teaching are onely for the Men:
Particular care is taken to instruct them
in all which is thought proper, to form
and improve the mind; whilst in the
mean time, the Women are let lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:103324:27"/>
in Idleness, Softness, and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance:
Or, otherwise grovel in low,
and base imployments.</p>
            <p>But for all this, we need but two
eyes to perceive, that the case of the
two Sexes is just like that of two
Brothers, in the same family; Where
the younger, notwithstanding of the
neglect of his breeding, makes often
appear, that the elder has no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
over him, but the start in coming
into the World.</p>
            <p>For what end serves commony the
Education which is given to Men? It
is useless to a great many for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
end: Nor does it hinder, but
that many fall into vice, and dissoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
And that others remain still igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
and even many times become
greater Fops than they were before.
If they had before any thing of breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
of briskness or civility, they lose
it by their study. All goes against them,
and they against all things; So that
one would say, that they had spent their
youth in traveling in Forraign Countreys
where they had only frequented the
Society of Salvages; so much Clown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishness,
and rudeness of manners they
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:103324:27"/>
bring home with them. All that they
have Learned is like goods of Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treband,
which they either cannot or
dare not vend: And if they have a
mind to venture into the World a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and therein appear as they ought,
they are obliged to go to School to
the Ladyes, there to learn garb and
complaisance; and all that out-side
which now adayes compleats a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman.</p>
            <p>If we come nearer, and consider this:
Instead of undervaluing the Women,
because they have no great Stock of
Learning, we should the rather esteem
them happy: Since that if on the
one hand they are thereby destitute of
the means to set off the parts, and
advantages which are the peculiar on
the other hand, they have not the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to spoile or lose them: Who,
notwithstanding that defect, advance in
Vertue, VVit, and good Grace as fast
as they grow in Years. So that,
should we without prejudice, or a
byassed Judgement, compare young men
when they come new off of the press,
with the VVomen of their own <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
and not know how either the one or
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:103324:28"/>
the other had been bred, we could
not but believe, their education to
have been quite contrary.</p>
            <p>The out-side alone, the air of the
face, the looks, the gate, the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
and the gestures, in VVomen,
speak somewhat 'posed, grave, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet,
which sufficiently distinguisheth
them from men; none can be more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
than they, words of double
meaning never escape their lips, the
smallest equivocation wounds their
ears, nor can they endure the sight
of any thing that choaks modesty.</p>
            <p>The Conduct of most men is of a quite
different stamp. Their March is oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
rash, and precipitant; their gestures
odd and Antick, their eyes Rambling
and un-settled: And are never more
pleased than when they are entertained
and fed with things which ought ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be kept silent or hid.</p>
            <p>Let us but converse a little with
VVomen, and that which the world
call the Learned, either in company toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or a part by themselves, and we
shall see the difference that is between
the one and other. One would say
that the men had stuffed their heads
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:103324:28"/>
with study, that they might Clogg,
and confound their VVits. Nothing
comes clearly from them, and the pain
that they put themselves to, to pump
for the words, quite spoils the rellish
of that which they might have said
to purpose; So that unless the natural
Wit be good, or they in company
with men of their one Gang, hardly
can they entertain an houres-Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</p>
            <p>Women on the contrary, express neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and in order, what they conceive:
Their words cost them nothing; they
begin, and go on at their pleasure, and
when they have their liberty, their fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
supplies them alwayes with inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hautible
liberality. They have the gift
of proposing their thoughts, with a
sweetness, and complacency that insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates
as strongly as Reason: When men
on the other hand, do it in a manner
rough and dry.</p>
            <p>Let any Questions be started in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of Women of clearer Wit, they
have presently the point that is drove
at; They consider it under more appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances:
What is said to purpose, finds
sooner acceptance in their minds; And
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:103324:29"/>
when that we are a little known to
them, and that they have no suspition
of us, we find their prejudices not so
strong as those of men; nor they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
so armed against the truth propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
They are altogether averse from
contradiction, and dispute, to which the
learned are so addicted: they nibble not
vainly at words, nor make use of those
Scientifick, and Mysterious terms which
are so proper to cover Ignorance; but
all what they say is sense and intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>I have taken delight to entertain my
self with Women, of all the different
conditions that I could meet-with, both
in the Town, and Countrey; to the end,
that I might discover the best, and
worst; and I have found amongst those
of them whom necessity, and labour,
had not rendred stupid, more sound
judgement than in the most part of
the workes, which pass with great
credit among the vulgarly learned of the
age.</p>
            <p>In speaking concerning God, it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
entered into one of their heads to
tell me, that she conceived Him, under
the shape of a venerable old man:
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:103324:29"/>
On the contrary, they said, that they
would not imagine, (that is) represent
him to themselves, under any appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
like to men: That they concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
there was a God, because they
could not comprehend that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
or that all other things which
did environ them, could be the work
of chance, or of any creature: and
that the conduct of their affairs being
no effect of their prudence, because that
the success thereof rarely answered the
wayes, and methods, which they had
taken; it must needs be the effect of
Divine Providence.</p>
            <p>When I asked them, What they
thought of their Souls; they never made
me answer: <hi>That it is</hi> a very subtile,
and thin flame, or a disposition of
the Organs of their Bodyes; nor that
it was capable of extension, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction.
On the contrary, they
answered, that they perceived very
well, that it was distinct from their
bodyes; And that the greatest cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
that they could say thereof,
was that they believed it altogether
unlike any of those things, which they
perceived by Sense; but that if they had
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:103324:30"/>
been Book-learned, they should have
known to a Hair what it was.</p>
            <p>It never entereth into the Head of
a Nurse, to say as Physitians do, that
their Sick began to be better, because
the Concoctive Faculty performs (lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dably)
its Functions: And when they
see a great Quantity of Blood stream
from a Vein, they laugh at those who
deny a Communication of the others
there-with by Circulation.</p>
            <p>When I would know of them, Why
it was that they believed, that
the Stones exposed to the <hi>Sun,</hi> and
<hi>Southern</hi>-Showers, did sooner wear,
than those that lay to the <hi>North?</hi>
There was none simple enough to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
me, That it comes to pass by
reason that the <hi>Moon</hi> gnawes them
with sharp Teeth, as some <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers</hi>
pleasantly fancy; but that (they
being dryed by the Heat of the <hi>Sun</hi>) the
following Showers made them the more
easily moulder.</p>
            <p>I have demanded (at least) of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
for the nonce, If they believed not
that <hi>God</hi> (by an Obediential, or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Power) could elevate a
Stone to the Beatifick Vision? But
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:103324:30"/>
could never draw from them any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Answer, but that they thought, I
jested with them by such a kind of
Question.</p>
            <p>The greatest Fruit that we can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
from Learning, is a just Discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and exactitude in Distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
of that which is true and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
from what is false and obscure;
thereby to avoid falling into Errour,
or Mistake. People are easily incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to believe, that Men (at least such
as pass for Knowing) have in this
the better of the Women. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless,
if we have but a little of that
Discerning and Exactitude of which I
spake, we shall find that it is one of
the Qualities they want most; For,
they are not only obscure, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
in their Discourses, (by which
good Quality they often sway, and
attract the Belief of simple and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous
Persons); but they even re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
that which is evident, and scoff
at those who speak in a manner clear
and intelligible, as too easie and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon:
They fall first upon any Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurity
proposed to them, as being
the most Mysterious of the rest. To
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:103324:31"/>
Convince them of this, we need do
no more but hear them with a little
Patience; and afterward, oblige them
to explain themselves.</p>
            <p>The Women are of an Humour
very far from this. VVe may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
that such as have a little seen
the World, cannot endure that even
their own Children should speak <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi>
in their Presence; they mistrust
others that do so; and often say,
That they are afraid lest some Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinency
be hid under such strange
Attires.</p>
            <p>We never hear them meddle with
the sacred Terms of Arts, as Men
call them; Nay, they cannot be made
so much as get them by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eart, though
their Memories be very good, and that
they have heard them often repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
And when we speak to them
in obscure and hard Words, they
frankly confess, that they want Wit
and Understanding to reach our Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
or other-wise, they well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
that such as Cant after that
manner, want Knowledge and Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to speak other-wise.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:103324:31"/>
In fine, if we consider the several
wayes and methods, whereby the
Men, and the Women, bring forth
what they know; we must judge,
that the one are like to Labourers
that work in Quarries, who (with
great Pain) win from thence rude
and shapeless Stones; And that the
Women (like skillful Architects, and
Masons) polish, and fitly place in
Work, what they have put into their
Hands.</p>
            <p>VVe find an infinite number of
<hi>Women,</hi> who not only Judge of things
with as much Exactness, as if they
had had the most exquisite Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
without either Prejudices, or
confused Notions (the ordinary stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling-Block
of the Learned); but also,
see many, that (with a Judgement
cleer and just) can Discourse of the
Objects of the most Refined Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
as if they had alwayes studied
them.</p>
            <p>They express their Minds with a
Grace; and have the Knack by hitting
on the best Terms in use, to speak
more with one word than <hi>Men</hi> can
do with many. If we Discourse with
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:103324:32"/>
them of Languages in general, they
have that pitch of Thoughts which is
not to be found but in the ablest
<hi>Grammarians:</hi> And, in short, They are
observed to draw more from Custom
alone, for the embellishing of their
Language, than the most part of
<hi>Men</hi> from Study and Practice both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
            <p>Eloquence is a Talent so natural,
and peculiar to them, that no Body
can dispute it: They perswade what
they please; and can Indite and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
without the help of Laws: So
that, there are but few Judges, who
have not proved them the most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
Proctors. Can there be any
thing more weighty, or Elegant, than
the Letters of several Ladies upon all
the Subjects that fall under ordinary
Conversation, and principally upon
the Passions? The Movements of which,
make up all the beauty and secret of
<hi>Rhetorick.</hi> They handle them with
so delicate a Touch, and express them
so Naturally, that we are obliged to
confess, that we feel them to be such
as they speak them; and that all the
Oratory of the World is not able to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:103324:32"/>
give to <hi>Men,</hi> that which costs nothing
to <hi>Women.</hi> The Flights of Eloquence,
Poesie, Harangues, Sermons, and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses,
soar not at all above their reach;
And nothing is wanting to their Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
but the Rules, and a few Terms
of Art.</p>
            <p>I am not ignorant, that this Treatise
it self, will not escape their Censure;
and that there are many who will find
fault with it: Some will condemn it,
as not at all proportionate to the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur,
and Dignity of the Subject:
That the Strain of it is not so Gallant,
the Stile so Noble, nor the Expressions
so Lofty and Elevated as was fit:
That there are several Passages slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
handled, where many Important
Remarks might have been imployed:
But I hope my Good-will, and the
Designe which I proposed, to speak no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Truth, and to avoid the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
Expressions which savour of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance,</hi>
will plead Excuse for me at their
Hands.</p>
            <p>They have (moreover) this Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
That the Eloquence of Action
is in them much more lively than in
<hi>Men:</hi> There, <hi>Men</hi> alone lets us see,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:103324:33"/>
that they intend so to speak, as to gain
the Point.</p>
            <p>Their Air is noble and great, their
Port free and Majestuous, their Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
decent, their Gestures naturall,
their Stile engaging, their Words ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
and their Voice sweet and mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.
The Beauty and Grace of their
Discourse (when it enters once the
Mind), opens to them the Door of
the Heart. If they reason of Good
and Evil, on their Countenance ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
that Character of Integrity,
which renders the Perswasion more
prevalent: And when they would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
Love for Vertue, their Heart is
seen on their Lips; and the Image
which they give thereof (decked with
the Ornaments of Discourse and
Graces, which are so peculiar to
them) appears a hundred times more
Lovely.</p>
            <p>It is pretty to hear a <hi>Woman,</hi> that
sets herself to plead; how clearly she
explains, and unties all the Knots and
Labyrinths of Affairs; precisely states
her own, and Parties Pretensions:
Discovers what hath given ground to
the Suit, and the manner how she has
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:103324:33"/>
managed it; what Engines she hath
set a work in all her Proceedings;
and how (in all things) she shewes a
certain Capacity in Business, which
is wanting to the most part of
<hi>Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is this which makes me think,
that if they made it their business to
study Law, they would succeed in it
(at least) as well as we; But we
see, that Peace and Justice is their stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
With Grief they hear of Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences,
and with Joy endeavour to
take them up friendly: Their Care in
that, makes them find out Turns, and
singular Expedients, for the Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling
of Minds; And, upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of their own, or their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
Families, they naturally make
these Reflections of Equity; upon
which, all the knowledge of Law and
Justice is founded.</p>
            <p>In the Rehearsals of those who are
Witty, there is alwayes some pleasing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
with order, which is not to be
found in ours: They discern what is
proper, or impertinent to the Subject;
decide the interests; describe the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
with their true and natural Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters;
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:103324:34"/>
unfold the intrigues, and trace
the greatest as well as the least, when
they set thereon. This is evidently to
be seen in the Histories, and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances
of ingenious Ladyes who are
still alive.</p>
            <p>How many are there that Learn as
much at Sermons, in Discourse, and
some little books of Piety, as many
Doctors with <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> in their
studyes, or upon their deskes? and
speak with that solidity, and depth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the highest Mysteries of all the
Christian Morality; that they might
often pass for great Divines, if they did
but wear a liar, or could Lugg into
play Latin sentences.</p>
            <p>VVomen seem born to practise
Physick, and to restore the sick to
health; for the neatness and comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
humour easeth one half of the
distemper; and they are not only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to apply remedyes, but likewise
to invent: They find out an infinite
number, which are commonly called
Small, because they cost less than those
of <hi>Galen</hi> or <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> and are not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
by Receit, but which are by so
much the more easy, and secure, as
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:103324:34"/>
they are simple and natural. In fine,
they make their observations in their
practises, with so much exactness, and
discourse thereof with so good reason;
That they often render useless all the
Places of the Schools.</p>
            <p>Amongst the countrey Women, those
that labour in the fields, are wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
skilfull in the odd, and unconstant
Freaks of Seasons; and their Alma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacks
are a great deal more certain
than those, which are printed from the
hands of Astrologers. They explain na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
the fertility and barrenness of
years, from the Winds, Rains, and what
else is produced by the change of VVea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
so that no body can hear them
discourse thereof, without pity and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
of the Learned, who charge all
these Effects or Aspects, Conjunctions,
Ascendencies of Planets and the like;
which makes me think, that if Women
had been taught, that, the alterations
to which the body of man is subject,
might come upon him by reason of his
particular constitution, his exercise, the
climate wherein he lives, his food,
education, and different occurrences of
Life; they had never let it enter in their
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:103324:35"/>
Heads, to have referred these Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Inclinations and Changes to the
Influencies of Starrs; Bodies at so
many Thousand Miles distant from
us.</p>
            <p>I confess, there are some Sciences,
of which <hi>Women</hi> are not at all heard
speak; because they are not the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of ordinary Vent, nor Society.
<hi>Alegebra, Geometry,</hi> and the <hi>Opticks,</hi>
never (or rarely) leave Studies, and
Learned <hi>Academies,</hi> to come into the
Croud. And, as their greatest use is,
to give just Measures to our Thoughts,
they ought not to appear in ordinary
Converse; but secretly, like hidden
Springs that move, and make great
Machins Play: my Meaning is, that
we should make such Application of
them in the Subjects of Converse and
Entertainment, as to think and speak
truly, and <hi>Geometrically,</hi> without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
great shew of our Art.</p>
            <p>All these Observations on the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
of the Mind, may be easily ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
amongst <hi>VVomen</hi> of a middle
Condition; But if we advance as far
as the Court, and be admitted into
the Entertainments of Ladies, there
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:103324:35"/>
is quite another thing to be Remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.
It seems that their Genius is
Naturally suited to their Quality;
their Quaintness, and polite Discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
speaks a frame of Spirit, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
fine, and easie; and some-what
Great and Noble, which is their own.
We may say, that Objects (like <hi>Men</hi>)
approach them with Respect; they
alwayes see them in their best Dresse,
and speak of them with an Air be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the Common. In a word, show
a <hi>Man</hi> that has a taste, two Letters of
Ladies of a different Rank, and he shall
easily know which of them is Highest in
Quality.</p>
            <p>How many Ladies have there been,
and how many are there still, who
ought to be placed amongst the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the Learned, if we assigne them
not a Higher Sphear? The Age where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we live hath produced more of
these, than all the past. And as they
have in all things run parallel with
<hi>Men,</hi> upon some Particular Reasons,
they ought more to be esteemed than
they: For, it behoved them to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
the Softness wherein their Sex
is bred, renounce the Pleasures and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:103324:36"/>
ness, to which Custom had condemned
them, overcome certain publick Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that removed them from study,
and to get above those disadvantagious
Notions, which the Vulgar conceive
of the Learned; besides, those of their
own Sex in general: All this they have
performed. And whether it be, that
these Difficulties have rendred their
Wit more quick and penetrating, or
that these Qualities are the peculiar
of their Nature, they have (proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably)
made Progress and Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
beyond <hi>Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may be said nevertheless (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
diminishing the Sentiments which
are due to such famous Ladies), that
it is occasion, and External means,
which hath advanced them to this
State, as well as the more Learned
amongst us; and that there are infinite
numbers of <hi>Women,</hi> which could have
done no less, had their Advantages been
Equal.</p>
            <p>And, seeing it is great Injustice to
believe, that all <hi>Women</hi> are Indiscreet,
because we know five or six to be so;
we ought also to be so equitable, as
to judge their Sex capable of Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:103324:36"/>
since we see many that have
raised themselves to a perfection
therein.</p>
            <p>It is commonly believed amongst us,
that <hi>Turks, Barbarians,</hi> and wild Sava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
are not so proper for learning as
the people of Europe; though it be
certain, that if we found five or six of
them here, that had the capacity or
title of Doctor (which is not at all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible)
they would correct our opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and confess, that these being men
like to our selves, they are capable of
the same things; and that if they had
been taught, they would not have yeilded
to us in the least. The Women, with
whom we live, deserve surely as much
as <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and Savages, to oblige
us to entertain thoughts no less rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
or advantagious for them.</p>
            <p>But if the head-strong vulgar (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
these observations) will
still stand upon it, that the VVomen
are not so fit for Arts, and Sciences as
we are; they ought at least to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that they have less need of them.
For it is for two ends that we apply
our selves to Learning; The one, that
we may attain to a true knowledge
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:103324:37"/>
of the objects of our Sciences; and
the other, that by such knowledge,
we may rise to virtue: So that in this
our short life, Knowledge being but
the hand-Maid to Vertue; and the
Women in possession of this: we may
conclude, that by a particular happiness,
they have gained the principal advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
of Sciences, without having ever
taken the pains to study them.</p>
            <p>What we see daily, is sufficient to
convince us, that they are no less
Christians than men; They receive the
Gospell with Simplicity and Humility;
and in following the Rules and Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims
thereof, are exemplary: Their reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
towards Religion, hath alwayes
appeared so great, that they are esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
without contradiction more devout
and pious than we: or, though it be true,
that their worship sometimes goes too
far; yet therein I cannot find them so cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable;
since the ignorance wherein they
have been bred, is the necessary cause
of that excess. If their Zeale be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discreet,
their Perswasion is at least
true; And we may affirm, that if they
had a clearer sight of Vertue, they
would embrace it after another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:103324:37"/>
since they cleave to it so fast, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
through obscurity and darkness it
self.</p>
            <p>It seems, that mercy and compassion
which is the Vertue of the Gospel is
in love with their Sex<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of their Neighbour no sooner touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
their mind, but it pierces their heart,
and brings teares in their eyes. Is it
not their hands that in publick afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
distribute the largest Charity?
And is it not at this day the Ladys that
take the particular care of the poor
and sick in the parishes, visit them in
prisons, and serve them in the Hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals?
Is it not these Religious Nuns,
dispersed in every quarter, who have
the charge at certain hours of the day,
to carry to such their food, and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
remedies; and have thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
the name of that Charity, which
they have so worthily practised.</p>
            <p>In fine; If there were no other Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in the world that discharged this
Vertue towards their Neighbours but
those who attend the sick in that great
Hospital, the <hi>L'Hotel-Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>u</hi> of <hi>Paris;</hi>
I cannot think that with Justice men
could pretend to the advantage above
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:103324:38"/>
their Sex therein. These are properly
the Virgins, with whom the Galleries of
the Illustrious, and Noble Women,
ought to be enriched: Of their life it is
that we should sing the highest Elogies,
and honour their death, with the most
excellent Panegyricks: Since here it is
that we may see the Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that is to say, truly <hi>Heroicke</hi> Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
practised up to the rigour, both
in it's precepts, and counsels; by young
Virgins, who Renouncing the World
and themselves, embrace a perpetual
Chastity, and Poverty, take their Cross,
and that the most heavy Cross of the
world, and render themselves for the
rest of their dayes, under the Yoak of
<hi>Jesus Christ:</hi> VVho Consecrate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to an Hospital, where the inffirm
of all sorts, of all countreys and Religions
are indifferently received, there to serve
all without distinction, and to change
themselves (according to the example of
their Lord and Husband) with all
the infirmities of mankind: without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
discouraged by having their eyes
Continually smitten with the most hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
of Spectacles, their eares with the
reproaches and cries of the sick, and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:103324:38"/>
their smelling with all the infectious
scents of Humane putrifaction: and who,
for a marke of that Spirit which does
guid them, carry in their armes from
bed to bed, and comfort the poor wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
not in vain words; but by the
effectual, and personal Example of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
and invincible Charity.</p>
            <p>Is there any thing amongst Christians
to be conceived greater than this? And
yet, Other <hi>Women</hi> are no less inclined
to assist, and comfort their neighbours;
they want nothing but opportunity,
when other business does not divert them
there-from. And I think it no less
unworthy to imagine from thence, (as
the vulgar commonly do) that <hi>Women</hi>
are naturally servants to men; than to
pretend that they, who have received
talents, and particular endowments
from God, are servants, and slaves to
those, for whose good they employ them.</p>
            <p>The conduct of <hi>Women,</hi> in what kind
of life soever they embrace, hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
somewhat remarkable. It seems
that such who live single, and yet keep
their freedome in the world, remain
only there to be a pattern, and give
example to others. Christian modesty
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:103324:39"/>
appears in their countenance and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire,
and Vertue makes their chiefest
Ornament. They wholly separate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from worldly Conversation and
pastimes; and their application the
works of Piety, and Religion, gives
clear proof, that they have only refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the cares, and trouble of Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
that they might enjoy a greater
liberty of mind, and be obliged to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but to please God.</p>
            <p>There are as many Monasteries
under the government of <hi>Women</hi> as of
Men, and their lives therein no less
exemplary. There, the recourse is
greater, the discipline no less Austere;
and the Abbesses of no less worth than
the Abbots. They setle Rules with so
admirable Wisdome, and Govern their
<hi>Nuns</hi> with such prudence, that sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
amongst them happens any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order:
and, in short, the fame of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
houses, and the great Rents which
they possess, are the fruits of the good
order of their Superiours.</p>
            <p>Marriage is a state of life, the most
natural, and ordinary to men; when
once they are ingaged therein, it is
Death that must discharge them, and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:103324:39"/>
there they spend these periods of
age, where reason ought to be the
chief guid, over the different acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents
of Nature and Fortune (to
which this Condition of Life is liable)
exercising them who live therein more
than others, &amp; gives them occasion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to give greater tryal of their Parts.</p>
            <p>A little Experience is sufficient to
inform us, That the <hi>VVomen</hi> here are
more fit and useful than we; For,
young Maids are capable to order a
House, at that Age, when <hi>Men</hi>
stand still in need of a Master. And
the most proper Expedient to reclaim
a young <hi>Man,</hi> and restore him to
the Right Way, is, to give him a
<hi>VVife;</hi> who may reclaim him by her
Example, moderate his Extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
and win him from his Debauches.</p>
            <p>What Complyance does not Wives
use, that they may live peaceably
with their Husbands? They submit
to their Humours, do nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
their Advice, lay constraint upon
themselves in many things for fear to
displease them, and even deprive
themselves of honest and lawful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations,
to free them from Suspition.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:103324:40"/>
It is well enough known, which of
the two Sexes is the most faithful to
the other, beares more patiently the
Misfortunes that happen in Marriage;
and thereby make appear greater Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and Discretion.</p>
            <p>All the Families (for the most part)
are Ruled by the Wives, to whom
their Husbands resigne the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
And the Care that therein they
take of the Education of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
is more considerable to Families,
and more important to the Common-Wealth,
than that which they take
of the Estate; they bequeath them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
wholly to their Good, and Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare:
The Fear which they are in, left
any hurt should befall them, is often
so great, that (many times) it robs
them of their Rest: They deprive
themselves often of their most neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
Enjoyments, to the end that they
may want nothing: They cannot see
them suffer in the least, without suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
themselves to the bottom of
their Souls. And we may say, That
it is their greatest pain, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ease them, by charging themselves
with their Troubles.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:103324:40"/>
Who can be ignorant, how earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they labour to instruct them in the
ways of Vertue, as much as their tender
Age is capable of? They endeavour
to make them know and fear <hi>God,</hi>
and teach them to Worship him in a
manner suitable, and proportionate, to
their Years: They take care to place
them in the hands of Masters, as soon as
they are fit; and choose such (with all
imaginable Caution) who may improve
them in their Breeding: And, which is
most to be esteemed, they alwayes joyne
good Example to their Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>If we should descend into an intire
Catalogue, and Retail of all the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currencies
of Life, and of all the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
which <hi>Women</hi> practise therein,
and thereof examine the most Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
Circumstances; we might have
Subject enough to enlarge into a most
ample Panegyrick. We might repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
how far their Sobriety in Eating,
and Drinking, does go; their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
in Trouble; their Courage, and
Fortitude, in supporting Affliction.
Fatigues, Watchings, and Fastings;
their Moderation in Pleasures, and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:103324:41"/>
Passions; their Inclination to do good;
their Prudence in Affairs; their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity
in all their Actions. And, in a
word, we might make appear, that
there is no kind of Vertue, which is
not common to them with us; But,
on the other hand, that there are a
great many considerable Faults, which
are peculiar to <hi>Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These are the general and ordinary
Observations, upon what concernes
<hi>Women</hi> in reference to the Qualities
of the Mind; the Use and Practice
of which, is the onely thing that
ought to put a Distinction amongst
<hi>Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, since there is not any Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter,
where <hi>Men</hi> may not disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Inclination, the Genius, the
Vice, the Vertue, and the Capacity
of Persons; those (who would unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
themselves concerning this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of <hi>VVomen</hi>) have alwayes occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to do so in Publick, or in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate;
at the Court, and at the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent;
in Recreations, and Exercises;
with the Poor, as well as the Rich;
in whatsoever Condition, or Quality
they be. And, if we consider sincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:103324:41"/>
and without Interest, what may
be observed on their behalf, we shall
find, that if there be some Appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
which seem less favourable to
<hi>VVomen,</hi> there are also more which
are most advantagious for them; that
it is not for want of Merit (but of
good Luck, and Strength) that their
Condition is not Equal to ours: And,

            <p>THat which confirms the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
in the thought which
they have of <hi>VVomen,</hi> is,
That they find it propt, and
supported, by the Sentiment of the
Learned: So that, the Publick Voice
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:103324:43"/>
of those who Rule by Credit, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in certain general Appearances,
to the Disadvantage of <hi>VVomen;</hi> it
is not to be wondered at, to see them
so ill entertained in the Minds of the
Ignorant, and Simple. And, it happens
in this as in a great many other
things, that <hi>Men</hi> confirm themselves
in one Mistake, by another, Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice.</p>
            <p>The Notion of Truth being Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
pinn'd to that of Knowledge,
<hi>Men</hi> fail not to take that for true,
which is proposed to them by those
who have the Reputation of being
Learned: And, as the number of
those which are such only by name,
is far greater than of these who are
so indeed; the generality of <hi>Men</hi>
(who only count Heads) do rank
themselves amongst the former; and
do so much the more willingly embrace
their Opinions, as they find them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
to such as they have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
entertained.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, seeing that <hi>Poets, Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
Historians</hi> and <hi>Philosophers,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
(likewise) <hi>VVomen</hi> to be Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
less Noble, and Perfect, than
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:103324:43"/>
               <hi>Men,</hi> they perswade themselves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the more, because they are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
that their Knowledg is the same
Prejudice with their own (though of
some-what greater extent, and more
specious); and that they do no more,
but joyne, to the Impression of Custom
the Sentiments of the Antients; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Authority of whom, all their
Certainty is grounded. And I find,
that (in respect of their Sex) they that
have studied, and they that have no
Reading, fall commonly into the same
Mistake; which is, To judge, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
they (whom they esteem) do
say, is true; because, they are alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
perswaded, that they say well;
instead of forbearing to think that they
say well, till that they are assured,
that they speak nothing but what is
true.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Poets</hi> and <hi>Orators,</hi> having no other
Designe but to please and perswade;
Probability, and appearance of Truth,
serves them to deal with the most part
of <hi>Men:</hi> So that, Exaggerations and
Hyperbolies, being most proper to
that purpose, in Magnifying and Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
their Notions, according as they
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:103324:44"/>
have need, they render Good or Evil,
Small or Great, at their Pleasure:
And, by a very ordinary fetch, they
attribute to all <hi>VVomen</hi> in general,
that which they find but in some of
them in particular. It is enough to
them, to have known some <hi>VVomen</hi>
Hypocrites, to make them say, That
the whole Sex is Guilty of that Fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
The Ornaments with which they
set off their Discourse, do wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
contribute to gain them the Credit
of such, as are not upon their Guard.
They speak smoothly, and with Grace;
and imploy some certain, pretty, taking
(and not common) Formes of Speech;
whereby they dazle the Mind, and
hinder the discerning of Truth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Men</hi> see a great many peeces (in
appearance) very strong against <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
and yeild thereunto; because
they know not what it is, that makes
up the Force and Verity thereof;
that it is only the Figures of Eloquence,
Metaphors, Proverbs, Descriptions,
Similitudes, Emblems, and other
Flowers of <hi>Rhetorick:</hi> And, because
that there is ordinarily a good deal of
Wit and Art in such kind of Works,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:103324:44"/>
they imagine (likewise) that there is as
much of Truth.</p>
            <p>One perswades himself, that <hi>VVo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>
love to hear Tales told them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he hath (perhaps) read the Sonnet
of <hi>Sarrazin,</hi> upon the Fall of the first
<hi>Woman;</hi> whom he feignes only to have
slipt, for lending her Ear to the Flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes
of the Devil. It is true, the Fancy
is pleasing, the Cast pretty, the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
proper enough to his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe,
and the Fall most Ingenious:
But, if we examine the Piece to the
bottom, and turn it into Prose, we
shall find, that there can be nothing
more false or faint.</p>
            <p>There are some People silly enough
to imagine, that <hi>VVomen</hi> are more
inclined to Fury than <hi>Men;</hi> because
they have read, that the Poets have
represented the Furies under the shape
of <hi>VVomen;</hi> without considering, that
this is only a Poetical Fancy: And that
Painters, who paint the Harpyes with
the face of a <hi>VVoman,</hi> paint likewise
the Devil under the Appearance of a
<hi>Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:103324:45"/>
I have known, some undertake to
prove <hi>Women</hi> Inconstant, from this, That
a famous <hi>Latin</hi> Poet hath said, That
they are subject to a continual Change;
and that another <hi>French Poet</hi> hath
pleasantly compared them to a Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-Cock,
which turns with the Wind;
Not minding, that all these manners of
speaking are onely fit to tickle, but not
instruct, the Mind.</p>
            <p>Vulgar Eloquence is a speaking
Optick, which represents Objects un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
what shape and colour <hi>Men</hi>
please; and there is not any Vertue,
which may not be made appear
Vice, by the Means which Eloquence
affords.</p>
            <p>There is nothing more ordinary, than
to find among the Authors, that <hi>VVo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>
are not so noble or perfect as
<hi>Men;</hi> but, for Reasons, we see none:
So that, there is great likely-hood,
that they have taken their Perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as the Vulgar do.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Women</hi> have no share with us in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Advantages, as Sciences and
Authority, wherein <hi>Men</hi> commonly
place Perfection; and therefore, they
are not so perfect as we.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:103324:45"/>
But, to be seriously convinced of
this, it ought to be proved, That
they are not thereto admitted, because
they are not at all proper; but that
is not so easie as <hi>Men</hi> conceive: Nor
shall it be difficult (in the Sequel) to
make the contrary appear; and that
the Errour ariseth from this, That <hi>Men</hi>
have but a confused Notion of Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Nobility.</p>
            <p>All the Arguments of those who
maintain, That the lovely Sex is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
so Noble, nor Excellent as ours,
are founded on this, That <hi>Men</hi> being
the Masters, they believe that all is
their own: And I am assured, that they
would more strongly believe the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
(I mean, that the <hi>Men</hi> are only cut out
for the <hi>vvomen</hi>) if they had all the
Authority in their Hands, as in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
of the <hi>Amazons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true, that here amongst us
they discharge no Offices, but what
are esteemed the Lowest: And, it
is also true, that (upon that account)
neither Religion, nor Reason, values
them the less. There is nothing base
and low but Vice, nor great but Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue:
And, <hi>VVomen</hi> shewing greater
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:103324:46"/>
Vertue than <hi>Men</hi> (in their lesser Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments),
deserve likewise to be
more esteemed. And yet, I know not,
whether (in regard of their ordinary
Charge, which is to Nurse and Bring-up
their Children) they are not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of the first Place in Civil Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>Were we free, and without Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth,
we would not assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
our selves together; but for the
better Preservation of Life, in the
peaceable Enjoyment of those things
which are necessary thereto; and would
have greater Esteem for those who
should hereunto contribute in greatest
measure.</p>
            <p>It is by reason of this, that we are
accustomed to look on our Prince, as
the chief Person of the State; because
his Care and Fore-sight is the most
general, and of greatest Extent;
and, by Proportion, we Respect those
that are under him. Most part of
<hi>Men</hi> preferr Souldiers to Judges, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they directly oppose themselves
to those who (in most terrible manner)
attack our Lives; and every one sets
a Value upon Persons, as they judge
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:103324:46"/>
them more or less useful. So that,
<hi>Women</hi> seem to be the most Estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
since their Service (which they
render to the Publick) is incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
greater than that of all others who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Men</hi> might absolutely dispense with
Princes, Souldiers, and Merchants, as
they did in the beginning of the
World; and as Savages do still, even
to this Day: But, in our Infancy,
we cannot be without <hi>Women.</hi> In
States that are well pacified, the most
part of those who have Authority,
are as <hi>Men</hi> dead and useless; but
<hi>Women</hi> never cease to be necessary to
us. The Ministers of Justice are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
proper to preserve Goods and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states,
to those who possess them;
but <hi>Women,</hi> to preserve Life. Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
are employed for <hi>Men,</hi> grown
up, and capable to defend themselves;
but <hi>Women</hi> labour for <hi>Men,</hi> when as
yet they know not what they are, if
they have Enemies, or Friends; and
at that time, when they have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Arms but Tears, against such as
attack them. Masters, Magistrates,
and Princes, do not often-times bestir
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:103324:47"/>
themselves, but for Glory, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Interest; when <hi>Women</hi> do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but for the good of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
whom they breed. In short The
Pains, the Cares, the Troubles, and
Assiduities, to which they expose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
can in no wise be matched in
any other state (of Civil Society) what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever.</p>
            <p>There is nothing (then) but Fancy,
which renders them less Valuable.
<hi>Men</hi> would largely Reward him who
had tamed a Tyger: Such who have
the Skill to train Horses, Apes, and
Elephants, are well considered of;
and we speak, with Elogy, of a <hi>Man</hi>
that hath composed a small Work,
which hath cost him but little time and
pains; And shall we neglect <hi>Women,</hi>
that spend many Years in breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and forming of Children? If we
enquire into the Reason thereof, we
shall find, it is, Because the one is
(onely) more ordinary than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>What <hi>Historians</hi> say to the Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
of <hi>Women,</hi> makes deeper Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
on the Minds of <hi>Men,</hi> than
the Discourses of <hi>Orators;</hi> For, as
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:103324:47"/>
they seem to put forth nothing of their
own Heads, so is their Testimony less
suspected: Besides, that it is suitable
to that whereof <hi>Men</hi> are already per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded,
when they report <hi>Women</hi> to
have been in former times, the same
which they are believed to be at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.
But all the Authority which
they have upon the spirits of <hi>Men,</hi>
is nothing but a very common Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice,
in regard of Antiquity; which
<hi>Men</hi> represent to themselves, under
the Image of a Venerable Old <hi>Man,</hi>
who (having much Wisdom and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience)
is uncapable of being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
or of speaking any thing but
Truth.</p>
            <p>Whil'st, in the mean time, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients
are no less <hi>Men</hi> than we are,
and as much subject to Errour; and
we ought no more at present to assent
to their Opinions, than we would
have done in their own times. <hi>Men</hi>
heretofore considered <hi>Women</hi> as now
they do, and with as little Reason:
So, whatsoever <hi>Men</hi> say concerning
that, ought to be suspected; seeing
they are both Judge and Party. And
when any one brings against them the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:103324:48"/>
Sentiments of a thousand Authors,
that History is only to be considered,
as a Tradition of Prejudices and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes.
There is, also, as little Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and Exactitude in Antient <hi>Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi>
as there is in Familiar Rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals;
wherein we sufficiently know,
that there is (almost) none at all.
They that have wrote <hi>Them,</hi> have
there-with mingled their Passions and
Interest; and the most part (having
but had confused Notions of Vice and
Vertue) have often mistaken the one
for the other. And those, who like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
Read <hi>Them</hi> (with the ordinary
Pre-occupation) fail not to run into the
same Fault.</p>
            <p>In the Prejudice wherein they have
been engaged, they have made it their
business, to exaggerate and raise the
Vertues, and Advantages, of their own
Sex; and to debase and weaken the
Merit of <hi>VVomen,</hi> by a contrary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest:
This is so easie to be disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
that I need not adduce Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding if we can but a little
rip-up what is past, we may find e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to prove, that <hi>Women</hi> have not in
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:103324:48"/>
any thing yielded to men; and that the
Vertue which they have made appear,
hath been more excellent: if we sincerely
consider all the Circumstances thereof,
we may observe, that they have giv'n
as great markes of Wit, and Capacity,
upon all occasions; That there have been
some who have governed great States
and Empires with Wisdom, and modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that cannot be parallel'd: others
who have rendred Justice with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity
equall to that of the <hi>Athenian
Areopagites;</hi> Many, who by their pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and counsells, have restablished
peace, and tranquillity to Kingdomes,
and a throne to their Husbands. Some
have been seen at the head of Armies,
or with a courage more than <hi>Heroical</hi>
defending themselves upon the walls
of Townes. How many have there
been, whose Chastity could receive
no blemish, neither by the terrible
threats, nor splendid promises which
men made to them, and who with a
Generous, and astonishing Gallantry,
have endured the most horrible tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
for the cause of Religion!
How many have there been, who have
rendered themselves as compleat as
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:103324:49"/>
men in all sorts of Sciences! who have
dived into the most Curious Secrets of
Nature, the most quaint of Policy, the
most solid of Morality, and who have
Elevated themselves to the highest Pitch
of Christian Divinity! So that History,
which the prejudiced abuse against that
Sex to abase it, may serve to those
who look thereon with the eyes of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
to prove that it is in all respects
as noble as our own.</p>
            <p>The Authority of Laws has a great
Weight upon many men, as to that
which concerns the <hi>Women,</hi> because
they make particular profession of ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
to every one their right. They
place the Wives under the Juri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
of their Husbands, as children
under the power of their fathers; and
alledge, that it is Nature that hath as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
them the smaller functions of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
and placed them at distance from
publick Authority.</p>
            <p>Men think themselves sufficiently groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to say the same after them: but I
hope it is lawfull without wounding
the Respect which is their due, to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
from them in Judgment. We should
strangely puzzle them, If we obliged
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:103324:49"/>
them to explain themselves intelligibly
about that which they call Nature in
this case, and make us understand in
what manner she hath distinguished
the two Sexes, as they pretend.</p>
            <p>We must consider that they who
have made or compiled the Law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being
men, have favoured their own
Sex, as <hi>VVomen</hi> possibly might have
done had they been in their place:
And Laws being made since the Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of Societies in the same manner in
respect of <hi>Women</hi> as they are at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent;
the Lawyers who had likewise
their prejudice, have attributed to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
a distinction, which is only draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
from Custome, besides that it was
not at all necessary to change the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which they found setl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the end that they proposed,
which was the good government of a
State by the administration of justice.
To be short, if they should be head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strong,
to hold, that <hi>Women</hi> are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
in a condition of dependance
upon men, we might fight them with
their own weapons, since they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
acknowledge dependance, and
servitude, to be contrary to the order
of Nature, which renders all mankind
equal.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:103324:50"/>
Dependence being a meer Corporal,
and Civil Relation, ought not to be
considered but as an effect of chance,
force, or custome; except in the case
of Children to those who have given
them life. And yet neither does that
pass a certain age, wherein men being
supposed to have reason, and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
enough to guide themselves, are
freed by the Lawes, from the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of an other.</p>
            <p>Amongst persons of an equal or not
much different age, there ought only
to be a reasonable subordination, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to which those who have less
understanding, willingly submit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to such as have more. And if
we remove the Civil Priviledges, which
the Laws have bestowed on men, and
which establish them heads of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily;
we cannot find betwixt them,
and their wives, any other submission
but that of Experience, and Knowledge:
both one, and other freely engage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
at the same time, when the
VVives have asmuch, and often more
Judgment than the Husbands. Their
Promises and Covenants of Marriage are
reciprocal; and the power equal upon
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:103324:50"/>
one and others Body; And if the Lawes
give the Husband more Authority o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the estate, Nature allowes the
Wife more power, and right, over the
Children. And as the will of the one
is not the Rule of the other; if the
wife be obliged to do what the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
minds her of, he is no less bound
to follow the advertisements of the
Wife, when she tells him his duty:
And, except it be in matters just, and
reasonable, the Wife is not to be
constrained to submit her self to the
pleasure of her Husband, unless youll
say that he is stronger; which is the
dealing of a <hi>Turk</hi> with a <hi>Moore,</hi> and
not of <hi>Men</hi> of reason.</p>
            <p>We shall not need much trouble to
rid our selves of the opinion of the
Learned, of whom I have spoken: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we may easily be satisfied that
their profession does not engage them
to so exact an enquiry into the nature
of things; Appearances, and probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
are sufficient for Poets and Orators;
The Testimony of Antiquity to Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;
And Custome and Practice to
Lawyers, to bring them to their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
end: But as to the Sentiment of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:103324:51"/>
               <hi>Philosophers,</hi> we must not so easily pass
it; seeing that they seem to be above
all the preceding considerations, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
they ought to be; and that they
are thought to try matters more strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
which gaines them the common
credit, and makes it believed unquesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable
what they assert, especially
when they contradict not the received
opinions.</p>
            <p>So the common People confirm them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in the opinion, that there is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality
betwixt the two Sexes, because
they see those whose Judgements they
regard as the measures of their own,
and the same opinion; not knowing that
the most part of <hi>Philosophers</hi> walk by
no other Rule than that of the Vulgar,
and that it is not by Vertue of Science
or Knowledge, that they often dictate
especially concerning the matter in
hand. They have carryed their preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices
even to the Schools, where
they have learned nothing that might
serve to disengage them there-from:
On the contrary, all their Science is
sounded upon the Judgements that
they have made from their Cradle;
And with them it is a crime or Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:103324:51"/>
to call in question that which
they believed before the years of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion.
They are not taught to know
<hi>Man</hi> by the body, nor by the soul:
And that which they teach, commonly
may very well serve to prove, that
betwixt us, and beasts, there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
difference, but that of Lesser
and Greater in the Same kind. They
hear not a word of Sexes: They are
supposed to know them sufficiently al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready;
Very far from Examining the
Capacity, and real and natural diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
betwixt them; which is one of
the most curious, and probably also
the most important Question of all
natural or Moral <hi>Philosophy.</hi> They
spend whole years and some all their
lives, at Trifles, and <hi>Entia Rationis,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no where to be sound without
their own Brains; and to plod and
find-out, whether or not, there be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the world imaginary Spaces; and
whether the atoms or small dust which
appeares in the Beams of the Sun, may
be sliced out into infinite parts.
What solid ground can we lay upon,
what the learned of this kind say,
when we are to treat of serious, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
matters?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:103324:52"/>
               <hi>Men</hi> may think, nevertheless, that
(though they be so ill taught them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
yet) their Principles (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably)
are sufficient to discover, which
of the two Sexes have (naturally) the
advantage of the other; But none can
think so, but such who either know
them not, or are pre-possessed thereby.
The Knowledge of our selves, is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
necessary to enable us, for
the handling of that Question aright;
and especially, the knowledge of our
Body, which is the Organ of Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
after the same manner, as for
to know how Telescopes, and Glasses of
Approach, magnifie the Objects: we
must know the Fashion of them. They
touch not this but in passing, no more
than they do Truth, and Science; I
mean, the Method of acquiring true
and certain Knowledges; without
which, it is impossible to examine,
Whether or not <hi>VVomen</hi> be as capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
thereof, as our selves? And, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
amusing my self to repeat the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that they give us thereon, I shall
declare (in general) what my Thoughts
are thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:103324:52"/>
All Man-kind being made alike,
have the same Sentiments, and Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
of Natural things; for example,
of Light, Heat, and Hardness; And all
the Knowledge which we labour to gain
there-from, is reduced to this, That
we may truly find out what is the
Disposition (internal and external) of
every Object, which produceth in us
the thoughts, and conceits, which we
have of them. All that Masters can
do, to guide us to this Knowledge,
is but, So to apply our Minds to what
we remark, that we may examine the
Appearances and Effects thereof, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Precipitation or Prejudice; and
to shew us the Order, which we are
to observe in the ranking of our
Thoughts, for to find what we look
for.</p>
            <p>For instance, If an Illiterate Person
should desire me to explain to him,
Wherein consists the Liquidity of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
I would not assert any thing, but
only ask him, What he had observed
thereof? How, that if Water be not
contained in a Vessel, it sheds? that
is to say, that all the Parts thereof
separate and dis-unite of themselves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:103324:53"/>
without the Intermixtion of any other
Body; that we may thrust there-into
our Fingers without trouble, and
without finding Resistance as from
harder Bodies? And that, in putting
therein, Sugar or Salt, we perceive,
that these two Bodies dissolve piece
and piece; and that all the Parcels
thereof are dispersed through the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
parts of the Liquor.</p>
            <p>Hitherto, I should teach him no new
thing; And if (after the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner)
I had told him, What it is to
be in Repose, or in Motion; I
should have brought him to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that the Nature of Liquors con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
in this. That their insensible Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
are in perpetual Motion; which
requires them to be enclosed in a Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,
and disposes them to give ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
Entry to hard Bodies: And
that the Particles of Water, which
are little, glib, and pointed, (insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
themselves into the Pores of the
Sugar) shake and divide the Parts
thereof, by their Justling; and, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
themselves every way, transport
with them into all the Quarters of
the Vessel, that which they have sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:103324:53"/>
This Notion of Liquors (which is
a Part, taken from the Body of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<hi>Philosophy</hi>) would appear a great
deal more clear, if we saw it in its
proper Place and Order: and it hath
nothing, which the meanest sort of
<hi>VVomen</hi> are not able to understand.
The rest of all our Knowledges (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
proposed in Order and Method)
have no greater Difficulty: And if we
consider attentively, we shall find, that
every Science of Reasoning, requires
but less wit and time, than is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to learn to make Point or Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistry.</p>
            <p>In effect, the Notions of Natural
things are necessary, and we form
them alwayes after the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
<hi>Adam</hi> had them as we have;
<hi>Children</hi> have them as Old <hi>Men,</hi> and
<hi>VVomen</hi> as <hi>Men:</hi> And these <hi>Idea</hi>'s
are renewed, confirmed, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
by the continual use of Sense.
The Mind is alwayes in Action; and
he that knows well how it proceeds in
one thing, discovers (without trouble)
how it works in all others. There is
nothing (but More and Less) betwixt
the Impression made by the <hi>Sun,</hi> and
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:103324:54"/>
that of a Spark of <hi>Fire:</hi> And, to
think well thereon, there is neither
need of great Skill, nor Exercise of
Body.</p>
            <p>It is not so, in the Works of which
I have spoken. There is need of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Application of Spirit; the <hi>Idea</hi>'s
thereof being Arbitrary, are har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to be learned, and retained;
which is the cause, that so much time is
necessary for to Learn (well) a Trade,
because it depends on long Exercise.
There is Skill required, rightly to
observe the Proportions on a Canvas;
to Distribute equally the Silk or the
Wool; to mingle with Exactness the
Colours; neither to joyne too close,
nor keep too open, the Points; to
place no more in one Rank, than in
another; to make the little Knots im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptible.
In a word, One must
know to make and vary, in a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
different Wayes the Works of
Art, to be skillful therein; when, as
in Sciences, there is no more required,
but an orderly viewing of Works al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
made, and alwayes Uniform:
and, all the difficulty of Success there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
proceeds more from the Incapaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:103324:54"/>
of Masters, than from the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
or Disposition of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
            <p>We must not then (any more) won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to see <hi>Men,</hi> and <hi>VVomen,</hi> (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Study) entertain themselves, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
things which concern Sciences;
since the Method of Teaching of them,
serves only to certifie our Judgements,
which are confounded by Precipitation,
Custom, and Use.</p>
            <p>The Notion which we have given
of Knowledge (in general) might suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to perswade unprejudiced Persons,
That <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>VVomen</hi> are equally
capable thereof; But, because the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Opinion is most deeply rooted,
we must (for the intire plucking of
it up) Fight it by Principles; to the
end, that (joyning the Appearances,
agreeing to the Beautiful Sex, which
have been presented in the <hi>First Part,</hi>
with the Natural Reasons which we
shall here-after adduce) <hi>Men</hi> may
fully be convinced, in favour of
it.</p>
            <div type="subpart">
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:103324:55"/>
               <head>That Women (considered according
to the Principles of Sound Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy)
are as capable as Men, of
all Sorts of Sciences.</head>
               <p>IT is easie to be Remarked, That
the Difference of Sexes, regards only
the Body: there being no other, but
that Part (properly) which serves for
the Production of <hi>Men:</hi> And, the
Spirit concurring no other way but by
its Consent (which it lends to all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the same manner) we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
That in it there is no Sex at
all.</p>
               <p>If we consider it in our selves, we
find it equal, and of the same Nature
in all <hi>Men,</hi> and capable of all sorts of
Thoughts; The smallest busie it as well
as the greatest; and there is no less
required to the right knowing of a
<hi>Gnat,</hi> than of an <hi>Elephant:</hi> Whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
knows wherein consists the Light
(and Fire) of a Sparkle, knows also,
the Light of the <hi>Sun.</hi> When we are
accustomed to reflect on things which
only concern the Spirit, we perceive
therein all (at least) as clearly, as in
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:103324:55"/>
the most material things which are
discerned by the senses. I can disco<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ver
no greater difference between the
Spirit of a dull, and ignorant man,
and of that one who is delicate, and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious,
than betwixt the Spirit of the
same man considered at the age of ten
years, and at the age of Fourty: And
since there appeareth no more betwixt
that of the two Sexes, we may affirm,
that their difference is not on that side,
the constitution of the body; But par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
the Education, Exercise, and
the impressions that come from all that
does surround us, being every where
the Natural, and Sensible causes of
so many diversities as are observed
therein.</p>
               <p>It is God who unites the Soul to the
body of a <hi>Woman,</hi> as to that of a <hi>Man,</hi>
and who joynes them by the same
Lawes. The sentiments, the passions,
and inclinations, make and entertain
that Union; And the Spirit operating
after the same manner in the one as
well as the other, is there equally ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of the same things.</p>
               <p>This is yet more clear, when we
consider onely the Head, the sole or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gane
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:103324:56"/>
of Sciences, and where the soul
exerciseth all its functions; the most
exact Anatomy remarks to us no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
in this part between <hi>Men,</hi> and
<hi>Women,</hi> their brain is altogether like
to ours: The impressions of sense are
received, and muster themselves there
in the same fashion, and are no otherwise
preserved for Imagination, and Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
<hi>Women</hi> hear, as we do, by the
ears; they see by the eyes; and they tast
with the Tongue; And there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
peculiar in the disposition of
these Organs, but that the <hi>Women</hi> have
them ordinarily more delicate, which
is an advantage. So that the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
objects affects them after the
the same manner, Light by the eyes,
and Sound by the eares. Who can
hinder them then to apply themselves to
the consideration of themselves? To
Examine in what consists the nature
of the soul; how many kinds of
thoughts there are, and how they are
excited by occasion of certain corporeal
Motions; to consult afterwards the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Notions, which they have of God;
and to begin with things Spiritual to
dispose in order their thoughts, and to
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:103324:56"/>
frame to themselves that Science <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

               </p>
               <p>Since they have also eyes, and hands,
may they not make themselves, or see
others perform, the dissection of an
humane body? consider the Symmetry,
and structure thereof; observe the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity,
difference, and relation of its
parts: their figures, their motion, and
functions; the Alterations to which they
are Subject? and to conclude, on the
means to preserve them in good disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and to restore it to them, when
it is changed.</p>
               <p>They need no more for this, but to
know the nature of Extrinsical bodies,
which have any reference to their own,
discover their Properties, and all that
renders them capable of making any
impression good or bad thereon; this
is known by the aid of the Senses,
and by the various Experiments that
are made upon them: And <hi>Women</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
equally capable of the one as well
as the other, might learn as well as
we, <hi>Physick</hi> and Medicine.</p>
               <p>Is there need of so much under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
to know, that Breathing is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
necessary for the preservation
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:103324:57"/>
of life; and that it is performed by the
means of the Air, which entering by
the pipe of the nose and mouth, is
insinuated into the lungs, for the cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the blood which passeth that way
in Circulation, and there causeth dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Alterations, according as it is
more or less Gross by the Mixture of
Vapours, and Exhortations, with which
we see it sometimes blended.</p>
               <p>Is it a matter so difficult to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
that the tast of Food consists on
the part of the body (in the different man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
how it is allayed on the tongue)
by the Spitle? There is no Person, but
finds after meals, that the Victuals
which then are put into the mouth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
divided quite other ways than those
with which we are Nourished, cause
there a Sensation less pleasing. That
which remains to be known of the
Functions of Mans body, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
in order, have nothing more
of difficulty.</p>
               <p>The Passions are certainly that which
is most Curious in this matter: We
may therein observe two things, the
Motions of the body, with the thoughts
and stirrings of the Soul, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:103324:57"/>
in them. <hi>Women</hi> may know this,
as easily as we do And as to the
causes which excite Passions, we know
how they do it. When we have once
by the study of Natural Philosophy
comprehended their manner, how Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumambient
things affect and touch us;
And by experience, and use, how we
thereto apply, or separate, our wills
and inclinations.</p>
               <p>In making regular Meditations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the objects of the three Sciences lastly
spoken of, a <hi>Woman</hi> may observe, that
the order of her thoughts ought to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
that of Nature; that then they are
exact when they are conform thereto;
that there is nothing but hast, and
precipitation in our Judgements, which
hinders that exactitude. And marking
consequentially the Oeconomy which she
hath observed to attain thereto, she may
make Reflections, which may serve her
as a Rule for the future, and form
to her-self there-from a Logick.</p>
               <p>If it be objected notwithstanding of
this, That <hi>Women</hi> by themselves could
never acquire these knowledges,
(which is but said); at least we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
deny, but that with the help of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:103324:58"/>
Masters, and Books, they might; As
the ablest men in all ages have
done.</p>
               <p>It is enough to alledge the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
property of the Sex, to prove
it capable of understanding the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions
of the Mathematicks: And
we should contradict our selves to
doubt, that if it applyed it self to the
making of Engines, it would succeed
as well therein as our own; since we
our selves allow it more invention and
artifice.</p>
               <p>There is need but of eyes, and a
little attention, in observing the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances
of nature, To make us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark
that the Sun, and all the Luminous
bodyes of the Heavens, are real Fires,
since they heat, and light us, in the
same manner as the Fires here below;
that they appear'd successively to answer
to several parts of the earth, and so
be able to judge of their Motion and
Course: And whosoever can roul in
his head great designs, and set to
work the Movements thereof, may
there likewise with exactness turn
the whole Machin of the World,
if he have but once well obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:103324:58"/>
the diverse Appearances of the
same.</p>
               <p>We have already found in <hi>Women,</hi>
all the Dispositions which render
<hi>Men</hi> proper for the Sciences, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
them (separately) in themselves:
And, if we continue to consider them
within distance, we shall also fir'd in
them those which are necessary for the
Sciences, which regard them, as tyed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
with their like in Civil Society.</p>
               <p>It is a Fault in <hi>Vulgar Philosophy,</hi>
to place amongst Sciences so great a
Distinction; that, following that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
Method of it, we cannot ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
any Tye or Coherence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them: which is the cause,
that we restrain so much the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of Humane Understanding; ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining
to our selves, that the same
<hi>Man</hi> is never (almost) capable of
many Sciences; that, to be fit for <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Phylosophy</hi> or <hi>Medicine,</hi> one is
not thereby proper for <hi>Rhetorick</hi> or
<hi>Divinity:</hi> and that there ought to
be as many different Capacities, as there
are Sciences, in the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:103324:59"/>
This Thought proceeds on the one
hand, from this, That <hi>Men</hi> confound
(ordinarily) Nature with Custome;
in taking the Disposition of certain
Persons to one Science, rather than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
for an Effect of their Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Constitution; when indeed, it is
often but a Casual Inclination, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from Necessity Education, or Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit:
And, on the other hand, for
want of having Remarked, that there
is (properly) but one Science in the
World, which is the Knowledge
of our selves; and, that all others are
onely particular Applications there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>In effect, the Difficulty which we
find at this day to learn the Tongues,
Moral Philosophy, and the rest; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
only in this, That we know not
how to referr them to this general
Science: From whence, it may have
arrived, That all those who have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
<hi>Women</hi> capable of <hi>Natural Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy</hi>
and <hi>Medicine,</hi> may not have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
judged them capable of the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
that we are to speak of. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
the Difficulty is the same on
both sides: It is the business in All,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:103324:59"/>
to think aright: And this we do, by
applying seriously our Minds, to the
Objects which represent themselves to
us; that we may raise from them
clear and distinct Notions; that we
may eye them in all their different Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Relations, and that we may
pass no Judgement thereon, but upon
what appears manifestly true. With
this we need no more, but to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
our Thoughts in a Natural
Order, for the obtaining of a perfect
Science: And here, there is nothing
too High for <hi>Women;</hi> For, such of
them who may be (by this way) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
in <hi>Natural Philosophy</hi> and
<hi>Medicine,</hi> may likewise (by the
same) become capable of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, might they not perceive,
that the necessity of living in Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,
obliging us to Communicate our
Thoughts by some External Signes;
the most expedient of all others, is
Speech; which consists in the use of
Words, agreed on amongst <hi>Men,</hi>
That we ought to have as many of
them, as we have Notions of things?
That they ought to have some Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:103324:60"/>
of Sound and Signification one
with another, to make us learn and
retain them with more ease, and
that we should not be forced to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply
them infinitely? That they
must be Marshalled in the Order
most natural, and suitable, to our
Thoughts; and that we should not
employ more in Discourse, than what
may be enough to make us be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood?</p>
               <p>These Reflexions might put a <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
in Condition, to labour (like a
Virtuosi) for the perfecting of her
Mother-Tongue; by reforming, and
cutting off the bad Words, introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of New, Regulating Custom by
Reason, and the true Notions which
we have of Languages: And the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
by which she might have Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the Language of her Country,
would wonderfully help her to the
attaining of that of Strangers, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the Delicacies thereof, to read
Authors, and to become most exact
in <hi>Grammar,</hi> and that which is called
<hi>Humanity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Women</hi> (as well as <hi>Men</hi>) Discourse
of things, to make them be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:103324:60"/>
in the same manner, as they
know them; and to dispose others to
do as they would have them, which
is called Perswading: In this they
Naturally succeed better than we. And
yet, to perform it still with Art, they
have no more to do, but to study to
represent things, as they present them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to them; or as they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
them to themselves, if they
were in the Place of those whom they
would affect.</p>
               <p>All <hi>Men</hi> (being made after the
same manner) are (almost) alwayes
moved in like manner by Objects;
And, if there be any Difference, it
proceeds from their Inclinations, their
Habits, or their Quality; which a
<hi>VVoman</hi> might know with a little Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion,
and Custom: And, being able
to dispose her Thoughts in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
most convenient, express them
neatly, and with Grace; adding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
the Gestures, the Air of the
Countenance, and the Voice, she might
become Mistress of the most perfect E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence.</p>
               <p>It is not credible, that <hi>VVomen</hi> can so
highly practise Vertue, without being
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:103324:61"/>
able to penetrate into the Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Maxims thereof: In effect, a <hi>VVo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
already so instructed as we above
represented her, might discover of
her self the Measures of her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
by discovering the three kinds
of Duties which comprehend all Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality;
of which, the first regards <hi>God,</hi>
the second our Selves, and the third
our Neighbour. The clear and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
Notions, which she may have
formed of her Spirit, and the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thereof with the Body, must (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly)
lead her to acknowledge,
That there is another Spirit Infinite,
the Author of all Nature; and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
of Him the Sentiments, upon
which Religion is founded. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

learned wherein it is, that Sensual
Pleasure does consist, and in what manner
External Things contribute to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of the Mind, and the Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the Body; she cannot fail
to conclude, That we must be great
Enemies to our selves, if we use them
not with great Moderation. And, if
she come, in Sequel, to consider her
Self, as engaged in Civil Society, with
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:103324:61"/>
others of the same Nature, subject
to the same Passions, and to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities
which can not be satisfied
without mutual assistance); she must with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
trouble fall upon this thought upon
which depends all our Justice, That we
ought to do to others as we would be
done to; and, that we ought to bridle
those desires, whereof the exorbitancy
which is called Lusting or Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
occasions all the trouble, and all
the unhappiness of life.</p>
               <p>She might the more still confirm
her self in the perswasion of the last
of these duties, if she advanced, and
carried on her thoughts, to the point
of discovering the ground of Policy,
and of Law and Justice. And, as both
the one and other, only regard the
duties of men amongst themselves,
she would judge, that, Fully to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
to what it is that they are obliged
in civil Society, we must understand what
it is that hath inclined men to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
it. She would then consider them
as out of any such Society, and find
them all intirely free, and equal, with
the desire only to preserve themselves,
and a right alike to all upon every
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:103324:62"/>
thing that might be necessary thereto.
But she finding that this equality en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gageth
men in warr, or continual
mistrust (a thing contrary to their end)
the light of nature would dictate, that
they could not live in peace, without
that every one yeelded some what
of his right, and came to covenants,
and contracts: And that to render
these Actions valid, and stop all Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousiy,
it would be necessary to have
recourse to a third person, who taking
upon him Authority, might force every
one to perform what they had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to others; That he being chosen
only for the good of his subjects, ought
to have no other designe; And that
to obtain the end of this instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
it is necessary he should be the
Master of Lives, and Estates; of Peace
and of Warr.</p>
               <p>In Examining this matter, and the
depth, what would hinder a Woman
that she should not discover, What na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
equity is; What are Contract,
Authority, and Obedience; what is the
nature of Law, the use of Penalties;
wherein consist the civil Law, and that
of Nations; what are the duties of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:103324:62"/>
Princes, and of Subjects: And in a
word, by her proper Reflexions, and by
Books, she might learn all that is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to make a Lawyer and a States-man.</p>
               <p>After that, she may have obtained
a perfect knowledge of her self, and
be solidly instructed in the general rules
of the conduct of Men, Probably she
would become curious to inform her self
also how it is that men live in strange
Countreys. And as she had observed,
that the changes of weather, of sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
of place, of age, of dyet, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
and exercises, had occasioned in
her, alterations and different passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
she needed not much trouble to
find that these diversities produce the
same effect in regard of whole nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
That they have Inclinations,
Customs, Manners, and Laws diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
according as they are more near, or
distant from Seas, the South or North,
according as their countrey is plain
or mountainous, watered with Rivers,
and Woody, the soil more or less
fruitfull, the particular kind of Food
which it bringeth forth; And according
to Commerce, and the affairs which
they have with other Neighbouring or
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:103324:63"/>
remote people: shee might study all
these things, and so learn what are the
Manners, the Riches, the Religon, the
Government, and the Interests of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
or thirty different Nations, as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
as of so many private families
For what concernes the Situation of
Kingdomes, how Seas to Lands, Isles
to the Continent do answer; there is
no more difficulty to learn it in a Mapp<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
than to know the several quarters
and streets of a Town; or the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
of the countrey, where one liveth.</p>
               <p>The Knowledge of the present, might
breed in her desire also to know what
is past: And that which she may have
retained of Geography, would afford
her great assistance in this Designe, ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
her better to understand affairs,
as Warrs, Voyages, and Negoations,
marking to her the places where they
have hapned; the Passages, Roads, and
the boundings of States. But the skill
which she may have obtained of the
Transactions of men in general, by the
reflections which she may have made
upon her self, would bring her into
the Mystery of Policy, Interest and
Passions; and help her to discover the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:103324:63"/>
moving wheele, and spring, of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes,
the fountain and source of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions,
and to supply in great Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings
the lesser things which have
made them prosper, and which have
escaped Histories: And following their
true Notions, which she hath of
Vice, and Vertue; she may observe
the flattery, passion, and ignorance of
Authors; and to guard her self from the
Corruption, which infect men in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Histories, where these faults are
commonly mingled. As the ancient po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy,
was not so refined as the modern,
and the interest of Princes less conjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in former times than at present,
and commerce of less extent; there is
more Judgement required to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
and disentangle our Gazettes, than
Lives of <hi>Quintus Curtius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are a great many persons that
find the <hi>Ecclesiastick History</hi> more pleasing
and solid, than civil or prophane:
because, there they find the effects of
Reason, and Vertue, farther pursued,
and that passions, and prejudices cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with a pretext of Religion, sets
the mind upon a method, alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
particular in its conduct. A
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:103324:64"/>
Woman would apply her self thereto
with so much more affection, as she
judged it more important. She might
convince her self, that the books of
<hi>Scripture,</hi> are as authentick, as all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
which we have; that they containe
the true Religion, and all the Maxims
whereon it is founded; that the <hi>New
Testament</hi> where the History of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
properly begins, is no more
difficult to be understood, than <hi>Greek</hi>
and <hi>Latin Authors;</hi> that they that
read it with the simplicity of Children,
seeking only the Kingdome of God,
discover the truth, and meaning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
with more ease and pleasure, than
that of ridles, emblems, and fables;
And after having regulated her mind
by the Morality of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> she
may find her self in condition to direct
others; remove their scruples, and to
resolve Cases of conscience, with more
solidity than if she had filled her
head with all the Casuists in the world.</p>
               <p>I see nothing that could hinder, but
that in the progress of her studies, she
might observe as well as a man, How
it is that the Gospel hath passed from
hand to hand, from Kingdom to King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:103324:64"/>
from age to age, even to her own
times, but that she might gain, by read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Fathers, the Notion of true
Theology, and find out that it only
consists in the Knowledge of the History
of Christians; and the Particular Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of those that have written there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
So, she might render her self able to
compose Works of Religion, Preach
the Truth, and batter down Novelties,
by shewing what hath been alwayes Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
through the whole Church,
about the Matters in Controversie.</p>
               <p>If a <hi>Woman</hi> be capable to inform
her self from <hi>History,</hi> of the Nature
of all Publick Societies, how they
have been formed, and how they are
preserved by virtue of a fixed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Authority<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> exercised by Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
and Officers, subordinate to
one another; she is no less, to Learn
the Application of that Authority, by
Laws, Ordinations, and Constitutions,
for the Conduct of those who are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
thereunto, as well to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of Persons (according to their
several Conditions) as for the Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
and Enjoyment of Goods. Is
it a thing so difficult, to know the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:103324:65"/>
Relation between a Husband and
his Wife, between a Father and his
Children, the Master and his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
the Land-Lord and his Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
betwixt those who are Allied
in Affinity, betwixt a Guardian and
his Pupil? Is it so great a Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
to understand what it is to pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess
by Purchase, Exchange, Donati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Legacy, Testament, Prescription,
and Usufruit? and what are the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
Conditions to render Use and Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
valid?</p>
               <p>There appears to be no more Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
requisite to know (aright)
the spirit of Christian Society, than
that of the Civil; to frame a right
Notion of the Authority which is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
thereto, and upon which is
founded all its Conduct; and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
(precisely) betwixt that
which <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> hath left to His
Church, and the Dominion which
onely belongs to Temporal Powers.</p>
               <p>After having made that Distinction
absolutely necessary to the right Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
of the Canon Law, a
<hi>Woman</hi> might study, and observe how
the Church is Governed in the State;
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:103324:65"/>
and how the Spiritual Jurisdiction is
mingled with the Secular; wherein
the Hierarchy consists; what are the
Offices of Prelates, the Power of
Councels, Popes, Bishops, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors;
what is the meaning of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,
what are the Rules and Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
thereof; what mean Canons, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges,
and Exemptions; how Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices
are Established, and what is
the Right and Possession thereof. In
a word, What are the Customs and
Ordinances of the Church, and the
Duties of all those that Compose it.
There is (therein) nothing at all, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
a <hi>Woman</hi> is not most capable; and
so, she might become most Skilful in
the Canon-Law.</p>
               <p>These are some general Notions of
the Highest Knowledges, where-with
<hi>Men</hi> serve themselves, to signalize their
Parts, and raise their Fortune; and
of which, to the Prejudice of <hi>Women,</hi>
they have been so long in Posse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">

And, although they have as great

                  </gap>
towards them, by so much the more
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:103324:66"/>
unjust, that nothing like is to be seen
in the use of the Goods of the Body.</p>
               <p>It hath been judged expedient;
that, for the Peace and security of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
Prescription should take place:
my Meaning is, That a <hi>Man,</hi> who
(with a good Conscience, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
trouble or molestation) might
have enjoyed the Goods of another
for a certain space of time, should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
Possessour thereof, without the
After-claims and Pretensions of any
whosoever. But, it hath never enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into the minds of <hi>Men,</hi> to believe,
That such who had fallen from their
Possessions by Neglect or otherwise,
should be incapable by some manner
or other, to retrive them; and
their Incapacity hath never been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
as Natural, but onely Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, <hi>Men</hi> have not
onely contented themselves not to call
<hi>Women</hi> to a share in Sciences, and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
after a long Prescription against
them; but have proceeded farther,
to fancy, that their Exclusion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from,
is founded on a natural Indispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
on their Part.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:103324:66"/>
In the mean-while, there is nothing
in the World more Fantastical than that
Imagination: For, whether that we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the Sciences in themselves, or that
we regard the Organs, which serves to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
them; we shall find, that both Sexes
are thereto equally disposed. There
is but one only way to insinuate Truth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Mind (whereof it is the Food),
as there is but one to convey Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment
into all sorts of Stomacks,
for the Subsistance of the Body:
And, as to what concerns the different
Dispositions of that Organ, which
renders us more or less fit for Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
if we would fairly and honestly
acknowledge, Who have the better,
we must confess it to be the <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We cannot disagree; but, amongst
<hi>Men,</hi> such as are gross and material,
are commonly stupid; and, on the
other hand, the more Delicate, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
most Sprightly. I find the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of this too universal and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
to stand in need (in this place)
of the Support of Reasons: So, the
lovely Sex, being of a Temperature
more Fine and Delicate than ours,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:103324:67"/>
would not fail (at least) to match
ours, if it applyed it self to Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
               <p>I well fore-see, that this Opinion
will not be relished by many; who will
find it a little strange: I cannot help
that. <hi>Men</hi> think that it concernes the
Honour of our Sex to take the Place
in All; And I believe it to be Justice,
to render to every one that which is
their right.</p>
               <p>In effect, we All (both <hi>Men</hi> and
<hi>Women</hi>) have the same Right to
Truth, since the Mind in all of us is
alike capable to know it; and that
we are (All) affected in the same
manner, by the Objects that make
Impression upon the Body. This Title
to Knowledges (which Nature bestows
on All) springs from this, That we
have All need of them, the one as
well as the other. There is no Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that seeks not to be happy; It is
to that, that all our Actions tend;
and no Body can be solidly so, but
by clear and distinct Knowledges:
For, it is in that, that <hi>Jesus Christ</hi>
himself, and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> make us believe,
will consist the Happiness of the other
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:103324:67"/>
Life. A Covetous Man never esteems
himself happy, but when he knows
that he possesses great Riches: An
Ambitious Person, when he perceives
that he is above others. In a word,
All the Happiness of <hi>Men</hi> (Real or Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary)
is only placed in Knowledge;
that is to say, In the Thought which they
have, that they possess the Good which
they desire.</p>
               <p>It is this which makes me believe,
that there is nothing but the Notions
of Truth (which we procure by Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and which are fixt and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
from the Possession or Want of
things), that can make up the true
Happiness of this Life. For, that
which makes that a Covetous Man
cannot be happy in the simple Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Riches, is; Because that, that
Knowledge which renders him hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
ought to be joyned with the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment,
or the Imagination of pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ssing
of them for the present: And,
when his Imagination presents them to
him as distant from him, and out of his
Power, he cannot reflect thereon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being afflicted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:103324:68"/>
It is altogether otherwise with the
Knowledge which we have of our
Selves, and of all those which depend
thereon; but, particularly, of those
which enter into the Society of Life.
Since then, that both Sexes are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of the same Felicity, they have
Equall Right to all that which
conduceth to the obtaining thereof.</p>
               <p>When we say, That Happiness con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
(chiefly) in the Knowledge of
Truth, we exclude not Vertue; On
the contrary, we think that it maketh
up the most Essential Part thereof:
Yet, a <hi>Man</hi> is not happy by Vertue,
but in so much as he knoweth that
he enjoyes it, or that he endeavours
so to do; that is to say, That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it be sufficient to make a <hi>Man</hi>
esteemed happy, that we see him pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
Vertue (though he know it not
perfectly); and also, that such a Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
(with a confused and imperfect
Knowledge) may contribute to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
the Happiness of the other
Life): yet, it is certain, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
esteem himself solidly happy, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
he be Conscious to himself that
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:103324:68"/>
he does good; as he would not at all
believe himself Rich, without he pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
Wealth.</p>
               <p>The Reason why there are so few
that have a Relish of, or Love for,
true Vertue, is, Because they know
it not; and, not at all minding when they
practise it, they feel not that Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
which it produceth, and which
makes up that Felicity of which we
speak. That ariseth from this, That
Vertue is not a simple Speculation of
Good, to which we are obliged; but
an Effective Desire, which springs from
the Perswasion that we have thereof:
And we cannot practise it with Delight,
without the Resentment of some E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion;
because it happens with it,
as with the most Excellent Liquors,
that seem some-time bitter, or without
Sweetness; if, when they are upon
the Tongue, the Mind be other-wise
taken up, and does not apply it self to
the Alterations which there they cause.</p>
               <p>The two Sexes have not only need
of Light, to find their Happiness in
the Practise of Vertue; but likewise,
need thereof to practise aright. It is
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:103324:69"/>
sion that sets us at work; and we are
so much the more perswaded of our
Duty, as the more perfectly we know
it.</p>
               <p>That little which we have said here
concerning Morality, sufficeth to insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate,
that the Knowledge of our
selves, is most important to streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
the Perswasion of the Duties,
to which we are obliged. And it
would not be difficult to shew, how
all others contribute thereto; nor to
make appear, that the Reason why so
many Persons practise Vertue so ill,
or fall into Looseness, is only the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
of themselves, and what they
are.</p>
               <p>The Reason why People commonly
believe, That <hi>Men</hi> need not be know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for to become Vertuous, is, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we see many vitious Persons,
that otherwise pass for Intelligent;
from whence, they imagine that Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
is not only unprofitable for Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
but even that it is many times de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
thereto. And, this Errour ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
the most part of those who have
the Reputation of being more Witty
than others, suspect to weak <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>udg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:103324:69"/>
and, at the same time, makes
them flight, and be averse, from the
Highest Knowledges.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Men</hi> take no notice, that there is
nothing but false Lights, which cast
and leave <hi>Men</hi> in Disorder; because
that the confused Notions (which false
<hi>Philosophy</hi> gives us of our Selves, and
of that which makes up the Body of
our Actions), so bemists the Mind,
that not knowing it self, nor the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the things which surround it,
nor the Relation which they have to
its self; and not being able to bear
the weight of Difficulties which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
themselves in that obscurity: it
must necessarily succumb, and abandon
it self to its Passions; Reason being too
weak to stop it.</p>
               <p>It is (then) but a <hi>Panick Fear,</hi> which
hath given occasion to the Capricious
Imagination of the Vulgar, That Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and Learning would render <hi>Women</hi>
more Wicked and Proud: There is
nothing but false Knowledge, capable
to produce so bad an Effect. A <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
cannot Learn true Knowledge,
without becoming thereby more Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and Vertuous: And there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:103324:70"/>
more proper to depress the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours,
and to convince her of her
Weakness, than to consider all the
Movements of her Engine, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licateness
of her Organs, the (almost)
infinite number of Alterations, and
painful Failings, to which she is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
               <p>There is not any Meditation more
capable to inspire Humility, Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and Mildness, into a <hi>Man</hi> (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he may be), than seriously to
mind (by the Study of Natural <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy</hi>)
the Union and Tye of his

that he is obnoxious to so many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eeds,
that the Dependance in which he is
(on the most ticklish and delicate

keep him constantly exposed to a

the least thing in the World is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
(entirely) to confound it; that
a little Choler, or Blood, more Hot or
Cold than ordinary, may cast himself in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Extravagance, Folly, and Madness;
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:103324:70"/>
and make him suffer fearful Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</p>
               <p>When such Reflexions should find
Acceptance in the Mind of a <hi>Woman,</hi>
as well as of a <hi>Man,</hi> they would
chase thence Pride, far from letting
of it in. And, if after having filled
her Mind with the best of Knowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
she should call again to her Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
all her by-past Conduct, to see
how she had arrived to the happy
state, wherein she might find her self
very far from elevating of her self above
others; she would see enough to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
her the more; since that, she would
necessarily observe by that review,
that (hereto-fore) she had had an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
number of Prejudices, which
she could not Conquer (but by
Strength) against the Impressions of
Custom, Example, and Passions;
which, in spight of her, engaged her
to them: That all the Effects which
she had made to discover Truth,
had been almost unprofitable: That
it hath been, as by Chance, that it
hath presented it self to her; and at that
time, when she the least dreamt thereof;
and in such Occurrencies, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:103324:71"/>
but once in ones Life, and but
to very few Persons: From whence,
she would infallibly conclude, That it
is unjust, and ridiculous, to slight and
despise those who have less Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
than our selves, or who embrace
contrary Opinions; and that we ought
the rather to have Complacency and
Compassion for them; because, if they
discerne not Truth as we do, it is not
their Fault; but because that it hath
not presented it self to them, when they
have been in search thereof: and that
there is still some Veil on their Part
or ours, that hinders it to appear to
their mind, in its full Light. And,
considering that she might have held
for true, that which she had believed
false before, she would judge with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt. That it might still happen
in the Sequel, that she might make
new Discoveries; by the which, she
might believe false or erroneous, that
which had appeared to her most true,
and certain.</p>
               <p>If there have been some <hi>VVomen,</hi>
who (affected with their Knowledge)
have become disdainfull; there are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
a great many Men that dayly fall
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:103324:71"/>
into the same vice; And that ought not to
be considered as an effect of the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
which they have possessed, but
because men have looked, on them as
a Mystery to the Sex: And as, on the
one hand, such knowledges are ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
very confused; and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
they that have them, propose to
themselves thereby a particular ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage;
it is not to be thought strange
that they take occasion from thence to
swell, and it is almost unavoidably ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
that in this condition, it should
not be with them, as with those who
from a low birth, and fortune, have
with difficulty raised themselves to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and same: who seeing themselves
advanced to a pitch, to which, few of
their quality have been accustomed to
mount, are seized with a giddiness,
which presents to them, objects quite
other-wayes than in themselves they
are. At least, it is most probable, that
seeing the pretended vanity of the
learned <hi>VVomen,</hi> is nothing in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
of that of the learned men,
who arrogate to themselves, the title
of Masters and Sages: <hi>VVomen</hi> would
be less Subject thereunto, if their Sex
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:103324:72"/>
were admitted into equal share w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> ours,
of the advantages which occasion it.</p>
               <p>It is then a vulgar Errour to fancy,
that Learning is useless to <hi>VVomen,</hi>
because sayes one, they have no share
in Offices, for the which, men apply
themselves thereto. It is as necessary
to them as Felicity, and Vertue; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
without that, we cannot perfectly
possess either the one or other. It is so
for the purchasing, of Exactness in our
thoughts, and Justice in our actions:
it is so, for the right Knowledge of
our Selves, and what is about us, that
we may make the right and lawfull
use thereof; and that we may regulate
our passions by Moderating of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires.
To become capable of places
and dignities, is one of the uses of
Learning; and to be fit to be a Judge
or Bishop, we should strive to acquire
as much as is possible, because with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it the functions of such Offices can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be well discharged, but not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely
for that end, and for to become
more happy by the possession of the
honours, and advantages which they
afford: That would be to abuse learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by a sordid and base end.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:103324:72"/>
So that there is nothing but weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
or a secret and blind interest
which can make men say, that <hi>VVo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>
ought to remain shut out from
Learning, for this reason, that they
have never been publickly admitted
to any share therein. It fareth not
with the goods of the mind, as with
the goods of the body; against them there
is no prescription: and how long soever,
we have been deprived thereof, we
have alwayes the right of Reversion.
But it being impossible that the same
goods of the body, could at the same
time, be possessed by several persons,
without domination on each side; men
have had reason for the safety of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
to maintain the possessours,
with good conscience, in prejudice of
the ancient proprietaries.</p>
               <p>But, as concerning the advantages
of the mind, it goes quite otherwayes.
Every one hath a right to all that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible,
and good sense. The Spring
of reason is not limited; it hath in
all men an equal Jurisdiction; we are
all born Judges of what touches and
affects us; And if we cannot dispose of
the same with equal power, we may
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:103324:73"/>
at least, all know them with a like right.
And as all men employ the use of the
light and air, without prejudice to any
person, by that communication, all may
likewise possess the Knowledge of truth
without hurting one another. For the
more that it is known, the more it
appears splendid, and lovely: The
greater are the number of those that
search after it, and the sooner they find
it: And if both Sexes, had equally
busied themselves therein, it had still
the sooner been discovered. In so
much then, that Truth and Knowledge
are goods which admit of no prescrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
And such that have been depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
thereof, may make a Re-entry, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doing injury to those who are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
Masters of the same; There
can be none, but such as would rule
mens minds by belief, and credit, that
have reason to apprehend this Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
for fear, that if Sciences should
become so common, glory might also;
and that the Fame to which they aspire,
should be lessened by partnership.</p>

               <p>THere is therefore no inconvenience,
if Women apply themselves to Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and Learning as well as we. They
are able to make a very good use of
them, and to draw from thence the
two Advantages which we expect there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from;
the one, to have clear and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
Knowledges, which we naturally
desire, and whereof the desire is often
stifled, and annihilated by the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of thoughts, and the cares, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations
of life: And the other, To em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
these Knowledges, for the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
conduct of themselves, and for
that of others in the different condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Society, of which they make
a part. This agrees not atall with the
common Opinion. There are indeed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that will believe, that Women may
learn what is to be attained by the
Physicks or Natural Sciences; but will
not admit, that they are as fit as Men
for those which may be called Civil, as
Ethicks, Laws, and Politicks; and that
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:103324:74"/>
if they should be able by the Maximes
of these Last, to conduct themselves,
they could not therefore be capable of
guiding of others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Men</hi> entertain this thought, because,
they consider not, that the mind in all
it's actions, hath need of no more but
Discerning, and Exactitude, and whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
hath once these two qualities in
one thing, may as easily, and by the
same means have them in all the rest.
The being Moral or Civil, changeth not
the nature of our actions: They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
to be still Natural: Because that
Morality is nothing else, but to know
the manner, how men regard the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of others, with Relation to the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which they have of good or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
of vice and vertue, of justice and
injustice; And as that, when we have
once rightly conceived the Rules of
Motion, in Natural <hi>Philosophy,</hi> we may
apply them to all the changes, and
varieties which are remarked in Nature:
So likewise knowing once the true prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of civil Sciences, there remains
no more difficulty to make application
thereof to the new, and incident E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mergents
which occurr.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:103324:74"/>
They that are in places have not alwayes
more wit, though they have better
Luck than others: And indeed it is not
necessary, that they should have more,
than the common; though it be to be
wished, that none were admitted to
employments but the most worthy.
We act still after the same manner,
and by the same Rules, in what estate
soever, we find our selves; unless it
be that the more our conditions are
raised, the more our cares and views
are extended, because we have the more
to do. And all the change which happens
to men who are placed above others,
is like to that of a person who being
mounted to the top of a Tower, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes
his prospect farther, and disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
more different objects, than they
who stay on the ground below: It is
their favours, if <hi>VVomen</hi> be as capable
as we are to guid themselves, they are
likewise to conduct others, and to have
place in charges and dignities of Civil So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.</p>
               <p>The most Simple, and natural use
that we can make of Sciences which we
have well learned, is to teach them to
others: And if <hi>VVomen</hi> had studyed
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:103324:75"/>
in the Universities with men, or in
others appointed for them in particular,
they might have entred into Degrees,
and taken the title of Master of Arts,
Doctor of Divinity, Medicine, Civil,
and Cannon Law: And their genius
so advantagiously fitting them to learn,
would dispose them likewise to teach
with success. They would find me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods,
and insinuating biassess, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>still
their Doctrine; they would disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the strength and weakness of their
Schollars, to proportion themselves to
their reach, and the facility which they
have to express themselves; and, which
is one of the most excellent talents
of a good Master, would compleat
and render them admirable Mistres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</p>
               <p>The employment which approacheth
most to a School-Master, is that of
Pastour or Minister in the Church,
and there can be nothing else but cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
shewn, which remove <hi>VVomen</hi>
there-from. They have a Spirit as well
as we, capable of the Knowledge and
love of God, and thereby able to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
others to know, and love him.
Faith is common to them with us:
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:103324:75"/>
And the Gospel with the Promises
thereof, are likewise addressed to them,
Charity also comprehends them in its
duties; and, if they know how to put
in practice the actions thereof, may
not they likewise publickly teach its
Maxims? Whosoever can preach by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
from stronger reason can do so
by Words: And a <hi>VVoman</hi> that should
joyn her Natural Eloquence with the
Morality of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> should be as
capable as another, to Exhort, Direct
Correct, admit into Christian Society
those who deserved. And cut off such
who after having submitted themselves
thereto, should refuse to observe the
Rules thereof. And if men were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed
to see <hi>VVomen</hi> in a Pulpit, they
would be no more startled thereat, than
the <hi>VVoman</hi> are at the sight of men.</p>
               <p>We are not assembled into Society,
but that we may live in peace, and
find, in a Mutual assistance, all that is
necessary for the Body, and Soul.
This we could not enjoy without trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
if there were no authority; that
is to say, that for that end, there ought
to be some persons who have power
to make Laws, and to inflict punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:103324:76"/>
upon the breakers of them. And
to make the right use of that autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
we must know to what it obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth,
and be perswaded that those who
possess it, ought to have no other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
in the discharge thereof, but to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the welfare and advantage of
their inferiours. <hi>Women</hi> being no less
susceptible of this perswasion than men,
may not we then submit our selves
to them, and consent not only not to
resist their Orders, but even contribute
as much as we can to oblige to obedience
such as make any difficulty therein?</p>
               <p>So that nothing needed to hinder, but
that a <hi>Woman</hi> might sit upon a Throne,
and that for the government of her peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
She might study their humour,
the interests, their Lawes, their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes,
and their practices: That she
might place in Offices of the Gown
and Sword, only able and deserving
persons; and, in the Dignities of the
Church, men of understanding, and
Example. Is it a thing so difficult, that
a <hi>Woman</hi> could not perform it, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
her-self of the strength, and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of a State, and of those that lay
round it; to entertain amongst stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:103324:76"/>
secret Intelligences for to discover
their designes, and disappoint their
measures, and to have faithfull Spies,
and Emissaries in all Suspected places;
to be exactly informed of all that pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
there wherein she might have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest?
Is there needfull for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of a Kingdome more vigilance,
and application than <hi>Women</hi> have for
their families, or the Religious for their
Convents? They would prove no less
refined in publick Negotiations, than
they are in private affairs. And as
piety and mildness is natural to their
Sex, their government would prove less
Rigorous than that of many Princes,
and we should wish for under their
Reign, that which is often feared un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that of many others, that Subjects
would regulate themselves according
to the Example of their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours.</p>
               <p>We may easily conclude, that if <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
are capable to possesse severally
all publick authority, they are still more
to be subordinate Officers and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters:
As Vice-Queens, Governants,
Secretaries, Counsellors of State, and
Treasurers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:103324:77"/>
For my part, I should be no more sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
to see a <hi>VVoman</hi> with a helmet
on her head, than to see her with a
Crown; preside in a Council of warr,
as well as in a Council of State: To
see her train, and exercise her Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
drawing them up in Battell-array,
and divide them in several Bodyes, and
Squadrons, with as much ease as she
would please her self to see it done.
The military Art hath nothing beyond
others, whereof <hi>VVomen</hi> are not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable,
unless it be that it is somewhat
more rude, causeth greater noise, and
does more mischief. The Eyes are
sufficient to learn from a Mapp, that is
somewhat exact, all the High-wayes
of a countrey, the good and bade pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages,
and the places that are most prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for surprizes, and encampings.
There is hardly a Souldier that is not
ready to know that a General ought
first to gain all the Passes before he
venture there his forces, regulate all his
enterprizes according to the advice of
good Scouts; And even deceive his
Army by Wiles, and counter-marches the
better to cover his design. A <hi>VVo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
can do all this, and can invent
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:103324:77"/>
Stratagems to surprise the enemy, put
the wind and dust in his teeth, and
the Sun in his face: And Charging
him on one side, Flank him on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
Give him false allarms, draw
him into an ambush by a feigned flight;
give battel, and be the first that mounts
a breach to encourage the Souldiers;
Perswasion, and passion does all: And
<hi>Women</hi> testifie no less heat, and reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
when their honour is concerned,
than is requisite to attack or defend a
Place.</p>
               <p>What can be reasonably objected,
why a <hi>VVoman</hi> of sound Judgement
and Understanding, might not take the
chaire in a court of Justice, and pre
side in all other companies. There are
a great many able men who would
learn the Lawes and Customes of a
state with less trouble, than some Games
at Cards, which <hi>VVomen</hi> understand so
well: And it is as easy to remember
them, as an intire Romance; is it not
as easiy to see into the heart of an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair,
as to trace an intrigue upon the
Stage, and make as faithfull report of
a Law suite, as of a Comedy? All
these things are alike ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

those who equally apply themselves
thereto.</p>
               <p>Now seeing there is neither office,
nor imployment in society which is not
comprehended in these whereof we
have spoken, nor where there is greater
need of knowledge or parts: it must
be confest, that <hi>Women</hi> are proper for
all.</p>
               <p>Besides, the Natural dispositions of
the body, and the Notions which men
have of the function and duties of
their places, there is still somewhat ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
that renders them more or less
capable to acquit themselves worthy
thereof. The true perswasion of what
a man is obliged to do, the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of Religion, and interest, emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
betwixt equals, desire of win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
glory, and Honour, and of making,
preserving, or increasing ones fortitude.
According as a man is more or less
touched with these things, his manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is altogether different: And <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>
being no less sensible thereof than
men, in regard of employments, they
want nothing to render them their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals.</p>

We may (then) with Assurance,
exhort Ladies to apply themselves to
Study; without having Respect to
the little Reasons of those who would
undertake to divert them there from.
Since they have a Mind (as well as
we) capable of knowing of Truth
(which is the only Subject, on which
they can employ their Pains worthily),
they ought to put themselves in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of avoyding the R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

having stifled a Talent, which they
might put to use; and of having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
Truth in Idleness and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
There is no other way for
them to Guard themselves against Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
and the Surprize to which they
are exposed (who Learn nothing but
by the manner of <hi>Gazets;</hi> that is to
say, upon the bare word of another),
nor to render themselves happy in
this Life, by practising Vertue with
Discretion.</p>
               <p>What Advantage soever they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to themselves besides this, they
would meet with it in Study. If their
Parlours were turned into Academies,
their Entertainments would be Grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
more Solid, and more Pleasing.
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:103324:79"/>
And every one may judge, of the
Satisfaction she should have to Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of Lofty Matters, by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
that she hath to hear others speak
thereof. How slight soever might be
the Subjects of their Conversation,
they would have the Pleasure to treat
them more wittily than the Vulgar:
And the delicate Manners, which are
so peculiar to their Sex (being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
by solid Reasons and Arguments)
would far more sensibly affect the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers.</p>
               <p>They who only desire to please,
would there (to Admiration) find their
Designe; For, the Splendour of the
Beauty of Body, being heighthened by
that of the Mind, would thereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a hundred times more Brisk and
Lively. And, as <hi>VVomen</hi> (but of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Beauty) are alwayes well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
when they are Witty, the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
of the Mind, Cultivated by
Study, would give them Means abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
to supply what Nature or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
might have denyed them. They
would be admitted into the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments
of the Learned, and reigne
amongst them upon a double Respect.
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:103324:79"/>
They would enter into the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Affairs: Their Husbands would
not refuse to abandon to them the
Conduct of their Families, and to take
their Advice in all things. And,
seeing that Matters are in such a
state, that they cannot (now) be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
into Charges, (at least) they
might be able to know the Nature of
Functions, and judge if they be deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly
bestowed.</p>
               <p>The Difficulty of arriving to this
Pitch, ought not to scare them: It is
not so great as <hi>Men</hi> have made it.
That which is the cause, why <hi>Men</hi>
think there is need of so much Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
for to gain a few Knowledges,
is, Because they teach (for that end)
a great many things, which are most
unprofitable for those that aspire there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.
All Knowledge (even to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent)
consisting only in possessing of
a <hi>History</hi> of the Sentiments of those
that are gone before us; and <hi>Men,</hi>
having too much reposed on Custom,

                  <hi>Men</hi> may render themselves qualified,

of Perfection, Nobility,
and Honesty, suit with them as
well as Men.</head>
               <p>HItherto, we have considered no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in <hi>Women,</hi> but the Head;
and, it hath appeared, that that
Part (taken in general) hath in them
as much Proportion for all the Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
(whereof it is the Organ), as in
<hi>Men.</hi> Nevertheless, because that this
Organ is not altogether alike, even
amongst all <hi>Men</hi> themselves; and that
there are a great many, in whom it is
more proper for some things than for
others: we must descend a little lower
into the Particular, to see if there be
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:103324:80"/>
nothing in <hi>Women,</hi> that renders
them less fit for Learning, than our
selves.</p>
               <p>We may observe, that they have
a Countenance more stately and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
than we: They have the Fore-Head
high, lofty, and large; which
is the usual Mark of Witty and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginative
Persons. And, we find in
effect, that <hi>Women</hi> have much Viva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
Fancy, and Memory; which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes
a Brain so disposed, that it ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
receives the Impressions of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
even of the most Slight and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable,
which escape such, as
are of another Disposition; and that
it retains them without trouble, and
presents them to the Mind in the
instant that it stands in need there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>When this Disposition is accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
with Heat, it renders the Mind
more ready and quick to be affected
by the Objects; to fasten on, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate,
into them the more; and to
extend the Images, and Impressions
thereof, at pleasure: From whence,
it happens, that they who have good
Imaginations (considering things on
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:103324:81"/>
more sides, and in less time), are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Ingenious, and Inventive; and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
more with one only Glance,
than many others after much Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
They are fit to represent things,
with an insinuating and pleasing strain,
and to find, on the Spot, Turns and
proper Expedients: They express
themselves with Facility and Grace;
and set off their Thoughts with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
Aadvantage.</p>
               <p>All this is Remarkable in <hi>Women;</hi>
and, I can see nothing in this Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
which is inconsistent with a
good Wit. Judgment, and Exactness,
make the Natural Character thereof;
to acquire which two good Qualities,
we must become a little Sedentary,
and dwell on Objects<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the end,
that we may avoid the Errour and
Mistake, wherein <hi>Men</hi> fall by skip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping.
It is true, that the multitude
of Thoughts, in brisk Persons, hurries
(many times) the Imagination; But,
it is likewise true, That, by Exercise,
it may be fixed. We have the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of this, in the greatest <hi>Men</hi>
of this Age; who, for the most part,
are all very imaginative.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:103324:81"/>
It may be affirmed, That this Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
is the fittest for Society; and
that <hi>Men,</hi> not being made to remain
alwayes alone, and shut up in a Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set;
we ought (in some measure) the
more to esteem those who have the
best Disposition, pleasingly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably
to Communicate their Thoughts.
And <hi>Women,</hi> who have naturally Wit,
(because they have Fancy, Memory,
and a sparkling Liveliness,) may with
a little Application, acquire the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
of a good Judgment.</p>
               <p>This is sufficient to prove, That,
in Respect of the Head alone, the
<hi>Two Sexes</hi> are Equal. There are Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations
upon the rest of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
which are most Curious; but of
which, we must only speak in pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Men</hi> have alwayes had this common
ill-Luck, to spill and shead (if we may
so say) their Passions on all the Works
of Nature: There is not any Notion,
which they have not blended with
some touch of Love or Hatred, of
Esteem or Contempt: And these
which concern the Distinction of the
<hi>Two Sexes,</hi> are so material, and so
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:103324:82"/>
befogg'd with the Sentiments of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection,
Baseness, Undecency, and
other Trifles; that, seeing they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be touched without moving of
some Passion, and stirring up the Flesh
against the Spirit, it is often Prudence
to let them alone.</p>
               <p>And yet, it is upon that odd Med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,
of alwayes confused Notions,
that the Opinions disadvantagious to
<hi>Women,</hi> are founded; and which the
small Wits (ridiculously) use to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
them. The justest Mean and
Temper, that can be betwixt the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of explaining ones Self, and
the Difficulty of doing it Innocently,
is, To observe what we ought (Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally)
to understand by Perfection
and Imperfection, by Nobility and
Baseness, and by Decency and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decency.</p>
               <p>When I conceive that there is a
<hi>God,</hi> I easily conceive, that all things
depend on Him: And if, after having
considered the Natural and Intrinsical
State of Creatures, which consists (if
they be Bodies) in the Disposition
of their Parts, with a Reference to
one another; and the Extrinsical, which
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:103324:82"/>
is the Relation that they stand in, to
act or suffer with other Beings that
environ them: If (I say) I enquire
into the Reason of these two Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
I can find, none other but the
Will and Pleasure of Him who is the
Author of them. I observe further,
that Bodies have (ordinarily) a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Disposition, which renders them
capable to produce and receive cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Effects; For example, that <hi>Man</hi>
can understand by the help of his
Ears, the Thoughts of others, and by
the Instruments of Voice, express to
them his own. And I Remark, that
Bodies are uncapable of such Effects,
when they are otherwise disposed:
From whence, I inform my self of
two Notions; whereof the one Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents
to me, the First State of
Things, with all their necessary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences;
and that I call the State
of <hi>Perfection:</hi> And the other, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
contrary; which I name <hi>Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So, a <hi>Man</hi> (in my Esteem) is Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
when he hath all that he need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
(according to Divine Institution),
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:103324:83"/>
for the producing and receiving the
Effects to which he is appointed: And,
he is imperfect, when he hath more
or fewer Parts, than aré necessary; or
any Indisposition that removes him
from this end.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, he being formed in such
manner, that he hath need of Aliment
for Subsistence, I look not upon that
Necessity, as an Imperfection; no more,
than the Need which is coupled with
the use of Food; that, what is Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous,
must be avoided out of the
Body. I find also, that all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are equally Perfect, as long as
they continue in their natural and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
State.</p>
               <p>We must not confound Perfection
with Nobility: These are two things
very different. Two Creatures may
be Equal in Perfection, and in Nobility
Unequal.</p>
               <p>When I make Reflexion upon my
Self, it seems to me, that my Spirit
(being only capable of Knowledge)
ought: to be preferred to my Body,
and be considered as the most Noble:
And, when I consider Bodies, without
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:103324:83"/>
any Respect to my Self; that is to
say, without reflecting, that they may
be profitable or hurtful to me, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
or displeasing; I cannot perswade
my self, that one is more Noble than
another, being All but made of matter
diversly Figured. Yet, when I medle
with Bodies (considering the Good
or Hurt that they do to me), I come
to esteem them differently. Although
that my Head (regarded without In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest)
affects me no more, than the
other Parts; nevertheless, I prefer it
to all the rest, when I come to think,
that it is of greater importance to me,
in the Union of the Spirit with the
Body.</p>
               <p>For the same Reason it is, that, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
all the Places of the Body be
equally perfect, we have (neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less)
different Esteems for them: The
very Parts themselves (whereof the
Use is most necessary) being many
times considered with some sort of
Contempt and Aversion; because that
the Use is less pleasing, or otherwise.
It is so with all that surround and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
us; For, that which makes that
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:103324:84"/>
one thing pleaseth one <hi>Man,</hi> and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaseth
another, is, that it hath
made impression upon them different<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p>It is the Engagement of <hi>Men</hi> in
Society, that produceth in them the
Notion of Decency: So that, although
it be neither Imperfection nor Base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
to ease and comfort the Body;
and that it is even a Necessity, and
Indispensable Consequence of its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Disposition; and that all the
wayes of doing thereof, are Equal;
there are some notwithstanding, that
are considered less Decent; because
they are more offensive to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
in whose Presence they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
               <p>As all Creatures, and all their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
being considered in themselves,
and without any reference to Custom
or Esteem that is made thereof, are
as Perfect, and as Noble, the one as
the other; they are likewise equally
Decent, being considered in the same
manner. Wherefore, we may say,
that the Regards of Decency and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decency
are almost all, in their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:103324:84"/>
nothing else but the Effects of
Imagination, and the Capriciousness of
<hi>Men.</hi> This appears by that, That
one thing which is Decent in one
Countrey, is not all so in another;
and that, in the same Kingdome, but
in divers places, or (in the same
time) but amongst Persons of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Condition, Quality, and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour;
the same Action is sometime
conforme, sometime contrary to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency.
So that, Decency is nothing
but the manner of using of Natural
Things, according to the Esteem
which <hi>Men</hi> pass upon them; and
to which, it is Prudence to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.</p>
               <p>We are all possessed with this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
although we make no Reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thereon, That all Persons (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they be our Beloved, or the
Witty and Judicious; who in Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
and according to the ordinary
Custom, subject themselves to the
Rites of Decency) discharge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
thereof in Private, as of Burdens
troublesome and foolish.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:103324:85"/>
The Case is the same with Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
In some Countries of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi>
the Labourers have the same
Rank, as the Nobles with us: In some
Countries, Sword-Men are prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Gown-Men; And in others,
the quite contrary is Practised: Every
one, according as his Inclinations
leads him to favour such States, or
that he esteems them most Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant.</p>
               <p>Comparing these Notions, with the
Opinions that the Vulgar have of
<hi>VVomen;</hi> we shall (without trouble)
discover wherein consisteth the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="subpart">
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:103324:85"/>
               <head>From whence is derived, the
Distinction of Sexes; How
far it extends it self: And
that it places no Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Men and Women, with
Relation to Vice and Vertue:
And that the Temperament,
and Constitution in general, in
it self, is neither good nor
bad.</head>
               <p>GOD willing to produce <hi>Men</hi>
in Dependence, one upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
by the Concourse of two
Persons; for that end, framed two
Bodies, which were different: Each
was perfect in its kind; and they
ought both to be disposed, as they are
at present: And all that depends on
their particular Constitution, ought
to be considered, as making a part of
their Perfection.</p>
               <p>It is then without Reason, that some
imagine, That <hi>Women</hi> are not so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:103324:86"/>
as <hi>Men;</hi> and that they look
upon that (in them) as a Defect, which
is an Essential Portion of their Sex;
without the which, it would be use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
for the end, for which it hath
been formed; which begins and cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
with Fecundity, and which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin'd
for the most excellent use of the
World; that is, to frame and nourish us
in their Bellies.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Two Sexes</hi> (together) are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to beget the like: And if we
knew, how it is that ours contribute
thereto, we should find enough to be
said against our selves. It is hard to
be understood, upon what they
ground themselves, who maintain,
That <hi>Men</hi> are more Noble than <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
in regard of Children; since it
is properly the <hi>Women</hi> who Conceive
us, Form us, and give us Life, Birth,
and Breeding. It is true, they pay
dearer for it than we: But their
Pain and Trouble ought not to be
Prejudicial to <hi>them,</hi> and draw upon
<hi>them</hi> Contempt, in place of Esteem,
which they thereby deserve.</p>
               <p>Who would say, That Fathers and
Mothers (who labour to bring up
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:103324:86"/>
their Children, good Princes to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
their Subjects, and Magistrates
to render them Justice,) are less E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimable
than they whose Aid and
Assistance they use, for to discharge
themselves of their Duties?</p>
               <p>There are some <hi>Physitians,</hi> who
have mightily enlarged themselves
upon the Temperament of <hi>Sexes,</hi> to
the Disadvantage of <hi>Women;</hi> and
have pursued their Discourses out of
sight; to shew, That their <hi>Sex</hi> ought
to have a Constitution altogether dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from ours, which renders it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
in all things. But their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
are only light Conjectures;
which come into the Heads of such, as
judge of things only by Prejudice, and
upon simple Appearances.</p>
               <p>When they perceive the <hi>Two Sexes</hi>
more distinguished, by that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards
the civil, than particular, Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions;
they fancy to themselves,
that so they ought to be; And, not
discerning exactly enough, betwixt
that which proceeds from Custom
and Education, and that which comes
from Nature; they have attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to one and the same Cause,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:103324:87"/>
all which they see in Society;
imagining, that when <hi>God</hi> Created
<hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Woman,</hi> he disposed them
in such a manner, as ought to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
all the Distinction which we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
betwixt them.</p>
               <p>This is to carry too far the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of <hi>Sexes:</hi> It ought to be boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by the Designe, which <hi>God</hi> hath
had to form <hi>Men,</hi> by the Concourse
of two Persons; and no more to be
admitted, but what is necessary for
that Effect.</p>
               <p>We see, that <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Women</hi> are
alike (almost) in all, as to the inward
and outward Constitution of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
and that the Natural Functions (on
which depends our Conservation) are
performed in both, after the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
It is then enough to the end, that
they may give Birth to a Third; that
there be some Organs in the one, which
are not in the other: And yet, it is not
necessary in respect of that, (as <hi>Men</hi>
imagine) that <hi>Women</hi> have less Strength
and Vigour than <hi>Men.</hi> And, as there
is nothing but Experience, that can
enable us to judge aright of that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction;
do not we find, that <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:103324:87"/>
are mixed, as we are? There are
some both Strong and Weak in both
<hi>Sexes. Men</hi> brought up in Softness
and Ease, are worse than <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;</hi>
and sink at first under Labour: But
when (by Necessity, or otherwise)
they are hardened, they become E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual,
and sometimes Superiour to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>It is just so with <hi>Women:</hi> They that
are taken up and employed in pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Exercises, are stronger than <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi>
who only handle the Needle.
And this may encline us to think, that
if both <hi>Sexes</hi> were equally Exercised,
the one might acquire as much Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
as the other; which, in former
times, have been seen in a Common-Wealth;
where Wrestling, and other
Exercises, were common to <hi>both:</hi>
The same is Reported of the <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zones,</hi>
in the South Part of <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We ought not (then) to lay any
ground on certain ordinary Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
drawn from the present State of
the <hi>Two Sexes.</hi> When we would
(mockingly) blame a <hi>Man,</hi> as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
little Courage, Resolution, and
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:103324:88"/>
Constancy, we call him <hi>Effeminate;</hi>
as if we would say, That he is as
Low, and Cow-hearted, as a <hi>Woman.</hi>
On the other hand, to praise a <hi>Woman</hi>
that is above the Ordinary, because
of her Courage, Strength, or Wit;
we say, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he is a <hi>Man.</hi> These Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
(so advantagious to <hi>Men</hi>)
do not a little Contribute, to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the high Notion that we have of
<hi>them;</hi> Because we consider not, that
they are but Likely-hoods; and that
their Verity indifferently supposes Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
or Custom; and so, are purely
Contingent, and Arbitrary. Vertue,
Mildness, and Integrity, being so pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to <hi>Women</hi> (if their Sex had not
been so little esteemed); when we
would have signified, with Elogy, that
a <hi>Man</hi> had all these Qualities in an
Eminent Degree; we would have said,
He is a <hi>VVoman,</hi> if it had so plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<hi>Men,</hi> to Establish this form of
Speech.</p>
               <p>What-ever the Matter be, it is not
the Strength of Body, that ought to
distinguish <hi>Man-kind;</hi> otherwise,
Beasts would have the advantage of
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:103324:88"/>
                  <hi>them;</hi> and, amongst our Selves, the
Strongest. Notwithstanding, we know
by Experience, that such who have
so great Strength, are proper for
nothing but Matterial Works: And
that these, on the other hand,
who have less, have commonly more
Brains. The ablest <hi>Philosophers,</hi> and
the greatest Princes, have been Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
enough; and the greatest Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
would not have (perhaps) been
willing to Wrestle with the meanest
of their Souldiers. Go but to a
Court of Justice, and you shall see,
whether the greatest Judge match al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
(in Strength) the lowest of their
Officers.</p>
               <p>It is then useless, to lean so much
upon the Constitution of the Body,
for to render Reason of the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
which is seen betwixt the <hi>Two
Sexes,</hi> in Relation to the Spirit.</p>
               <p>The Temperament does not consist
in an indivisible Point: For, as we
cannot find two Persons in whom it
is altogether alike; neither can we
any more determine, precisely, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it is that they differ. There are
many sorts of <hi>Cholericks, Sanguines,</hi>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:103324:89"/>
and <hi>Melancholicks;</hi> and all these Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities
hinder not, but that they
may be often as capable the one, as
the other; and that there may be
excellent <hi>Men,</hi> of all sorts of Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions:
And even supposing, that
that of the <hi>Two Sexes</hi> be as diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
as it is pretended to be; there
is still found greater Difference a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
many <hi>Men,</hi> who are (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing)
believed capable of the same
things. The More, and the Less, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so little considerable, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but a spirit of Wrangling, that
can make it be regarded.</p>
               <p>It is propable, that that which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grosseth
so much (into Notion) the
Distinction whereof we speak, is,
That <hi>Men</hi> examine not precisely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
all that which is Remarkable
in <hi>Women:</hi> And that Defect makes
us fall into the Errour of those, who
(having the Mind confused) distinguish
not aright, what (severally) belongs
to things; and attribute to one, that
which only pertains to another; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they find them together in the
same Subject. Wherefore, finding so
great Difference in <hi>Women,</hi> as to the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:103324:89"/>
manner of Actions, and Functions;
<hi>Men</hi> have transferred it to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament,
for want of Knowledge of
the true Cause.</p>
               <p>However it be, if we would exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
which is the most Excellent of
the <hi>Two Sexes,</hi> by the comparing of
Bodies; <hi>Women</hi> might pretend to the
Advantage, and without insisting on
the Internal Fabrick of their Bodies;
and that it is in them, that the thing
in the World (the most Curious to
be known) passeth; to wit, How that
<hi>Man</hi> (the most Beautiful and Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
of all Creatures) is produced:
Who can hinder them to say, That
that which appeareth in the out-side,
ought to give them the better? That
Comeliness, and Beauty, are natural
and peculiar to them; and that it is
this, that produceth Effects as sensible,
as ordinary: And that, if what they
can performe by the inside of the
Head, renders them (at least) <hi>Mens</hi>
Equals; the Out-side seldome ever
failes, to render them absolutely their
Mistresses.</p>
               <p>Beauty being as real an Advantage,
as Strength and Health, Reason for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:103324:90"/>
not to plead Pre-eminence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from,
rather than from the others:
and if we should judge of its Value
(by the Sentiments and Passions, which
it excites), as we judge (for the most
part) of all things; we would find;
that there is nothing more estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
there being nothing so effective;
that is to say, which moves and stirs
more Passions, and does mingle and
fortifie them more diversly, as the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
of Beauty.</p>
               <p>It would not at all be necessary, to
speak any more concerning the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament
of <hi>VVomen;</hi> if an Author
(no less Famous than Polite) had not
thought fit to consider it, as the force
of the Defects which <hi>Men</hi> commonly
charge them with; which helps much
to confirm People in the Opinion,
That they are less to be valued than
we. Without relating his Opinion,
I say, that for the right examining of
the Temperament of the <hi>Two Sexes</hi>
(with a Reference to Vice and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue),
it must be considered in a State
indifferent; when, as yet, neither Vice
nor Vertue were in Nature: And
then we shall find, that that which in
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:103324:90"/>
one time is called Vertue, may in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
pass for Vice (according to the
use that <hi>Men</hi> make thereof); So that, in
that case, all Temperaments are alike.</p>
               <p>For the better Understanding of this
Opinion, we must observe, that there
is nothing but our Soul capable of
Vertue; which, in general, consists
in a firm and constant Resolution, of
doing that which we judge, the best;
according to the divers Occurrencies
that we meet with. The Body (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly)
is nothing but the Organ, and
Instrument of that Resolution (as a
Sword in ones hand), both for Offence
and Defence: And all the different
Dispositions (which renders it more
or less fit for that use), ought not to
be called good or bad; but as their
Effects are more ordinary, and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,
for Good and Evil: For exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
The Disposition to Flight, for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyding
the Evils which threaten us, is
Indifferent; because there are some,
which cannot otherwise be shunned;
and then, it is Wisdom to flye: When,
on the other hand, it is culpable
Cowardise, for one to betake him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to his Heels, when the Danger is
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:103324:91"/>
superable, by a generous Resistance;
which produceth more Good than
Hurt.</p>
               <p>But the Mind is no less capable in
<hi>VVomen,</hi> than in <hi>Men,</hi> of that firm
Resolution, which makes up Vertue;
nor of knowing the Ran-counters,
when it is to be put in Practice. They
can Regulate their Passions, as well as
we; and are not more enclined to
Vice, than to Vertue. We might e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
make the Ballance turn to their
Favour on this side; since that the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
towards Children (without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison,
stronger in <hi>VVomen,</hi> than in
<hi>Men</hi>), is naturally linked to Compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
which we may call, the Vertue
and Bond of Civil Society. It being
impossible to conceive, That Society
is rationally Established for other end,
than to supply the common Wants and
Necessities of one another. And if we
nearly observe, How Passions are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in us; we shall find, that after
the manner that <hi>VVomen</hi> contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
to the Production and Education
of <hi>Men,</hi> it is a Natural Consequence,
that they should treat them in their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,
in some sort as their Children.</p>

               <p>IT is so much the more important to
Remark, That the Dispositions,
which we bring with us into the
World, are neither (in their Nature)
good or bad; that otherwise, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

whereby <hi>Men</hi> often refer to Nature,

               <p>
                  <hi>Men</hi> torture their Minds, to search
for a Reason, Why we are subject to
certain Faults, and have particular
Customs; for want of having obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that which may be produced in
us, by Habit, Exercise, <hi>Education,</hi>
and outward Condition; that is to say,
The Relation of Sex, Age, Fortune,
and Employment, wherein we are pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in Society: It being certain, that
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:103324:92"/>
all these different Views diversifying,
in an infinite number of wayes, the
thoughts, and passions, answerably dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the minds quite other-wayes,
to look on the truths presented to
them. It is for that Reason, that
the same Maxime, proposed at the
same time to Citizens, Souldiers, to
Judges, and Princes, affects them, and
makes them Act so differently: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
that <hi>Men</hi> caring for nothing
but the out-side; Look on it as the
Rule, and measure of their Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
Whence happens, that the
one lets pass as useless, that which
very much takes up others; That
Sword-men are Choaked with that
which flatters Gown-men: And
that Persons of the same Constitution
take sometimes certain things in a
contrary Sense; Which enter by one
and the same biass into the minds
of Persons of different temperament;
but who have same the fortune, or edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
               <p>It is not that we pretend, that all
men bring into the World the same
bodily constitution. That would be
indeed, an ill-grounded pretence: There
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:103324:92"/>
are some that are quick, and some
flow: but it appeareth not, that that
diversity any way hinders the minds
to receive the same instruction: all
that, it does, is, that some receive it
more readily and happily than others.
So that what temperament soever <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
have, they are no less capable
than we, of truth and studies. And
if we find at present, in some of them
some defect, or impediment; or even
that all of them, do not look into so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
matters, as men do; to which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
experience is contrary,
that ought solely to be rejected up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the outward condition of their Sex,
and on the education, which is given
them, which comprehends the ignorance
wherein they are left, the Prejudices
or Errours, which are instilled in them,
the Example which they have of others
their like. And all the wayes to
which <hi>Decorum,</hi> restraint, reserve,
subjection, and fears, reduceth them.</p>
               <p>In effect, nothing is omitted, on their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
which may serve to perswade them,
that this great difference, which they
see betwixt their Sex, and ours, is a
work of Reason, or divine institution.
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:103324:93"/>
The apparel, education, and exercises,
cannot be more different. A Maid is
not in security but under the wings of
her Mother; or under the eyes of a
Governant that never leaves her: They
Frighten her with every thing: Threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
her with Spirits, and Hobgoblines,
in all the corners of the house, where
she may be alone: Even in the streets,
and Churches, there is something to be
feared, if she have not her guards. The
great care which is taken to dress her,
takes up all her mind: So many lookes
as are glanced at her, and so many
discourses, which she heares of beauty,
imployes all her thoughts; And the
complements, which she receives on
this Subject, makes her therein place
all her happiness. As they never speak
to her of any thing else, with that she
limits all her designs, and carryes no
higher her prospects. Dancing, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and reading, are the greatest ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises
of <hi>Women;</hi> all their library con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
in a few little Bookes of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
with that which is in the little
cabinet.</p>
               <p>All their Science is reduced to work
with a Needle. The Looking Glass
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:103324:93"/>
is the great Master and Oracle
which they consult. Balls, Playes, and
the Modes, make the subject of their
Entertainments: They consider their
meetings as, famous Accademies, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they go to inform themselves of
all the news of their Sex. And if it
happen, that some one or other distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
themselves from the common, by
the reading of certain Bookes, which
they had trouble enough to catch, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to unlock their minds, they are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
obliged to hide themselves: The
greatest part of their companions, out
of Jealousie or other respects, never
failing to accuse them of intending to
play the rare things.</p>
               <p>As to Maids of meaner condition,
forced to gain their lively-hood by their
labour; their parts are still more use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less.
Care is taken to make them
learn a trade convenient to their Sex,
as soon as they are fit thereto, and their
necessity of imploying themselves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
therein, hinders them from
thinking of any thing else: And when
both one, and others of them, bred in
this manner have attained to the age
of marriage, they are engaged therein,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:103324:94"/>
or otherwayes confin'd to a Cloyster,
where they go on to live as they have
begun.</p>
               <p>In all that which is taught to <hi>Women,</hi>
do we see any thing that tends to so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
instruction? It seems on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
that men have agreed on this
sort of education, of purpose to abase
their courage, darken their mind, and
to fill it only with vanity, and fop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peries;
there to stifle all the seeds of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
and Knowledge, to render useless
all the dispositions which they might
have to great things, and to take from
them the desire of perfecting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
as well as we by depriving them
of the means.</p>
               <p>When I seriously think on the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
how men look upon that which
they think to see faulty, in <hi>VVomen,</hi> I
find that such a carriage hath in it
somewhat beneath persons endowed
with reason. If there be equal occasion
of finding of fault in both Sexes, that
which accuseth the other, offends against
Natural equity; if there be more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
in ours, and that we see it not,
we are rash to speak of the faults of
others; if we see it, and conceal it,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:103324:94"/>
we are unjust to blame the other who
hath less. If there be more good in
<hi>Women,</hi> than in <hi>Men; Men</hi> ought to
be accused of ignorance, or envy, not
to acknowledge it, when in a <hi>Woman</hi>
there is more Vertue than Vice, the
one should serve to excuse the other;
and when the defects that she hath
are insurpassable, or that the means
to rid her self thereof, or guard there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from,
are wanting, as to <hi>Woman</hi> they
are, such a one deserves compassion, not
contempt. In fine, if these defects be
but slight, or onely apparent, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence
or Malice to insist on them;
And it is not hard to prove, that men
commonly carry so in respect of <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is commonly said, that they are
timerous, and uncapable of defence;
that they are afraid of their shadow,
that the cry a child allarmes them,
and the whistling of the Wind makes
them tremble. That is not Universal.
There are a great many <hi>VVomen</hi> as bold
as men, and it is known that the most
fearfull make often of necessity a Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue;
timerousness, is almost inseparable
from vertue, and all vertuous persons
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:103324:95"/>
have it: As they would not do hurt
to any, and that they are not ignorant
how much wickedness is amongst men;
a small matter is enough to fill them
with fear. It is a Natural passion,
from which no body is exempt: all
men fear death, and the troubles of life;
the most powerfull Princes apprehend
the Rebellion of their Subjects, and
the invasion of enemies, and the most
valiant Generals to be surprized una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares.</p>
               <p>Fear is great, proportionably, to the
force which men think they have to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist;
and it is not blameable, but in
such in who are strong enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
the evil which threatens them:
And we should be as unreasonable to
accuse a Judge, or a man that had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
minded any thing but his Book,
of baseness, for refusing to fight a
duel; as to blame a Souldier who had
alwayes carryed arms, for not daring
to enter into dispute against a learned
<hi>Philosopher.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>VVomen</hi> are bred in a manner that
gives them ground to apprehend, and
fear every thing; they have not light e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to avoid surprizes in matters of
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:103324:95"/>
Understanding. They have no share in
the exercises which give strength and
dexterity for attacking, and defending;
They see themselves exposed helplesly
to suffer the outragiousness of a Sex;
so subject to Transports, which regards
them with contempt, and that often
treats its like with more rage, and
cruelty, than Wolves do one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Wherefore timerousness in <hi>VVomen</hi>
ought not to pass for a defect, but rather
for a Rational passion, to which they
owe modesty, which is so peculiar to
them; and the two great advantages of
life, which are the inclination to Vertue;
and the aversion from Vice, which the
greatest part of men with all the edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
and light which are given them,
can hardly acquire.</p>
               <p>Fear of want is the ordinary cause
of Avarice, <hi>Men</hi> are no less subject
thereunto than <hi>VVomen;</hi> And if we
came to an account, I know not if the
number of the first should not be
found greater, and their covetousness
more blame worthy; Since the midle
Vertue is not far distant from the two
Vices, the Extreams, men often mistake
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:103324:96"/>
the one for the other, and confound
avarice with laudable frugality.</p>
               <p>As the same action may be good in
one, and bad another, it often happens
that that which is evill in us, is not
at all so in <hi>VVomen:</hi> They are destitute
of all means to make their fortune
by their parts, the door of Sciences,
and Employments, being shut against
them; And so being in worse conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to guard themselves against the
misfortunes, and inconveniences of life,
they ought more to be concerned. It
is no wonder then, that herewith they
seeing what a great trouble it is to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
a small estate, they take care to
keep it.</p>
               <p>If they receive so easily that which
is told them, it is an effect of their
candour, and ingenuity, that will not
suffer them to think, that these who
have authority over them, are ignorant,
or interested; and we offend Justice, to
accuse them of credulity, since there is
yet more amongst us. The ablest men
suffer themselves to be too much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lured
by a false appearance; And all
their Knowledge is often times, but a
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:103324:96"/>
mean credulity, but of somewhat
greater extent than that of <hi>Women:</hi> I
mean, that they are not more knowing
than others; but because they have
more Lightly given their consent, to
a greater number of things, of which
they have retained the Notions, right
or wrong, by having so often run them
over.</p>
               <p>That which causeth timerousness in
<hi>Women,</hi> produceth likewise superstition,
which the learned themselves impute
to them: But in this, the learned ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
like those, who being most in the
wrong, perswade themselves that they
are in the right, because they make
a Lowder Noise than others. They
fancy that they themselves, are clear
from superstition, because they find it
in some ignorant <hi>Women,</hi> whil'st in the
mean time, themselves are therein mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
plunged up to the eares.</p>
               <p>Though all men were the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipers
of God, in Spirit, and in Truth,
and that <hi>Women</hi> rendered him only
Superstitious adoration, in this they
would be excusable. They are not at all
taught to know God by themselves:
they know nothing of him, but what
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:103324:97"/>
is told them: And, as the most part
of <hi>Men</hi> speak of him in a manner, so
unworthy of what he is, and distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
him not from his Creatures, but
only by the attribute of Creator; it is
no wonder, that <hi>Women</hi> only knowing
him upon their report, Worship him
by Religion, with the same Sentiments
that they have for men, whom they
fear and reverence.</p>
               <p>There are some men, that think they
can sufficiently Mortifie the <hi>VVomen,</hi>
by telling of them, that they are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else all of them but tatlers.
They have reason to be vexed, at so
impertinent a calumny. Their body is
so happily disposed by the tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which is propper to them, that
they distinctly retain the impressions
of Objects, which once they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived:
They represent them to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
without Trouble, and express them
with wonderful Facility: That is the
Reason, that the Notions which they
have, awakening on the least occasion,
they begin and continue their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
at their Pleasure: And the
Quickness of their Spirit (giving them
Means to perceive, easily, the Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:103324:97"/>
of things among themselves, they)
pass without trouble from one Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to another; and, by that means,
can speak a long time, without letting
the Discourse flag or dye.</p>
               <p>The Benefit of Speech, is naturally
accompanied with a great desire of u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of it, when occasion offers: It is
the only Bond of <hi>Men</hi> in Society;
and many find, that there is no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Pleasure in the World, nor more
becoming the Mind, than to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
their Thoughts to others.
Wherefore, <hi>Women</hi> being able to
speak with Ease, and being bred and
brought up with others; they were
to be blamed, if they failed to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
themselves.</p>
               <p>They ought not, then, to pass for
Tatlers, but when they speak out of
purpose; and of things, which they
understand not, without desire of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.</p>
               <p>We must not imagine, that People
never tatle, but when they talk of
Cloths and Fashions. The Tatle of
News-Mongers, is often more ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous:
And that, store of Words,
heaped one upon another (and which
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:103324:98"/>
signifie nothing at all, in the most part
of Works), make a Chat far more
simple, than that of the silliest of <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi>
At least, we may say, That the
Discourses of these, are real and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible;
and that, they are not vain
enough, to imagine (as the greatest
part of the Learned do), That they
are Wiser than their Neighbours;
because they utter more Words, and
less Sense. If <hi>Men</hi> had a Tongue as
free, it would be impossible to make
them hold their Peace. Every one
entertains himself with what he knows;
Merchants about their Business, <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers</hi>
with their Studies, and <hi>Women</hi>
about that which they have been able
to Learn; And they may say, That
they would have entertained themselves
better, and with greater Solidity, if
there had been as great Care for Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
taken with <hi>them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It choaks a great many, that <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
in their Conversation, testifie a
great desire to know every thing. I
know not what can be the Palat of
these <hi>Men,</hi> that cannot relish, that
<hi>VVomen</hi> should be so Curious: For
my part, I am well pleased, that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:103324:98"/>
should be curious; and I only ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
them, to manage it so, that they be
not troublesome there-with.</p>
               <p>I look upon the Conversations of
<hi>VVomen,</hi> as upon those of <hi>Philosophers;</hi>
where it is equally permitted to all,
to entertain themselves about things,
of which they have no Knowledge;
and there are cross Times in the one, as
well as the other.</p>
               <p>It is ordinary with many <hi>Men,</hi> to
treat the Curious, like Beggars. When
they are in an Humour of bestowing,
they take it not ill to be asked; and
when they have a mind to discover
what they know, they are glad to be
entreated; If not, they fail not to
say, Ye are a little too Curious. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>Men</hi> have forged to themselves,
that Women ought not to Study;
they stand upon their Points, when Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
demand to be informed of that
which is Learned by Books. I esteem
them Curious things; and regret, they
have not the means to satisfie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
therein; being often (only) hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
by a just Fear, to address them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
for that end, to touchy and
foolish Heads; by whom they would
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:103324:99"/>
find themselves jeer'd, instead of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
Instruction. It seems to me,
that Curiousity is one of the most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Signes of a good Wit; that is,
more capable of Learning. It is a
Knowledge begun,-which sets us for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and makes us proceed farther
in the way of Truth. When two Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
are touched by the same thing, and
that the one looks upon it with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency,
and the other draws nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,
with designe to see it better; it
is a mark, that this hath the Eyes
more open. The Mind in both Sexes,
is Equally sit for Sciences; and the
Desire, which it may have of them,
is no more to be blamed in the one,
than in the other. When the Mind
finds it self affected with a thing, which
it sees but obscurely, it seems to be
by a Natural Right, that it would be
cleared therein: Ignorance being the
most irksome Slavery (wherein it can
be), it is as unreasonable to condemn
a Person, who strives to get out of
it; as a Wretch, who should endeavour
to escape out of a Prison, where he
were shut up.</p>

Amongst all the Faults that Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men

In the mean-time, they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
are not less subject thereto;
But because, they see themselves Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
they think that every thing is
lawful to them: And that Women,
being once engaged to them, the knot
ought to be indissoluble (onely) on
their part; although that they be both
Equal, and that every one is obliged for
their own share.</p>
               <p>They would not so often (Mutually)
accuse one another of Levity, if they
observed, that it is Natural to <hi>Men;</hi>
and that, he that sayes Mortal, sayes
Inconstant; and that, it is an Indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensible
necessity of being, in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
which we are made. We judge
not of Objects, we love, or hate
them not; but upon Appearances,
which depend not on us. The same
things appear to us diversly; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,
because they have suffered some
Alteration; some time, because we
our selves are changed. The same
Meat, more or less Seasoned, (Hot
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:103324:100"/>
or Cold) causeth in us quite different
Sensations: And, remaining still the
same, we are otherwise affected there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
in Sickness, than in Health. In
our Infancy, we are indifferent, as to
Things; which, ten Years after, we
look upon with Passion, because the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
is Changed.</p>
               <p>If a <hi>VVoman</hi> loves us, it is, Because
she thinks us Lovely; and, if another
hate us, it is, Because we appear to
her Hateful. In one time we esteem
those, whom we have slighted before;
because they have not alwayes appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to us the same; whether it be
They, or We, who are Changed. And
such an Object, being presented to the
Heart, hath found the Door open;
which, a Quarter of an Hour sooner
or later, had been barr'd against it.</p>
               <p>The Hovering, wherein we many
times find our Selves betwixt two dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Inclinations, which one and the
same Object causeth in us, convinceth
us in spight of our Teeth, that the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
are not free; and that we are
unjust to complain, That we are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
considered of, than we would. As a
small Matter is enough to kindle Love;
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:103324:100"/>
so, a little thing can extinguish it: and
that Passion depends no more upon us
in its Progress, than in its Birth. Of
ten Women, that aspire to be Loved,
it falls out ordinarily, That she who
hath least Merit, least of Birth and
Beauty, shall carry it over the rest;
because that she may have had a Bris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
Air, or some-what more in Mode,
or suitable to our Gusto, in the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
that then we find our selves in.</p>
               <p>It is so far from doing wrong to
Women, to accuse them of being more
Cunning and Artificious than Men,
that Men speak for them, if they
know what they say; since; by so
saying, they acknowledge them to be
more Witty and Prudent. Artifice is
a secret way of attaining an End pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
without being diverted: There
is need of Wit, to find out that way;
and Dexterity, to manage it: And
we cannot find fault, that a Woman
imployes Artifice, to avoyd being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.
Craft is far more Pernicious,
and more ordinary amongst Men: That
hath alwayes been the common Road,
to enter into the Places and Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
where they may do greatest
Mischief.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:103324:101"/>
And, instead of that, That <hi>Men</hi>
(who have a mind to Cheat), employ
their Goods, their Understanding, and
their Power, from which we are rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
secure: <hi>VVomen</hi> have nothing to
use, but Caresses and Eloquence, which
are natural Means; against which,
we may more easily guard our
Selves, when there is any reason of
Mistrust.</p>
               <p>For the Summary of Accusation and
Defect, it is said, That <hi>VVomen</hi> are
more malitious and wicked than <hi>Men:</hi>
And all the Evil, with which <hi>Men</hi> can
charge <hi>them,</hi> is shut up in this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
I do not believe, that those
who entertain this Thought, do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
That there are more <hi>VVomen</hi>
than <hi>Men,</hi> who do Mischief: That
would be a manifest Falshood; For,
they have no part in Employments,
and Charges; the abuse of which, is
the cause of all publick Calamities;
and their Vertue is too Exemplary;
and the Disorders of <hi>Men</hi> too well
known to call them in question.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Men</hi> (then) say, That <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>
have more Malice; it signifies no
more, but that, when they set them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:103324:101"/>
to do Evil, they do it more
dextrously, and drive it farther than
<hi>Men.</hi> Let it be so. This marks in
them a most solid Advantage: For,
one cannot be capable of doing much
Mischief, without having good Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and without being also (by
Consequence) capable of doing much
Good. So that, <hi>VVomen</hi> ought not
to look upon this Reproach, more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious,
than that which might be
made to Rich and Powerful <hi>Men;</hi>
that they are more wicked than the
Poor, because they have more Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunies
of hurting: And <hi>VVomen</hi>
might answer, as they; That, if they
can do Hurt, they can also do Good;
and that, if the Ignorance wherein
they are left be the cause, Why they
are worse than we; Knowledge, on the
contrary, would render them much
better.</p>
               <p>This short Discussion, of the most
signal Defects (which <hi>Men</hi> conceive
peculiar, and natural, to the lovely
<hi>Sex</hi>) proves two things; the one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That
they are not so considerable, as the
Vulgar Imagine; and the other That
they may be Rejected, upon the little
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:103324:102"/>
Education which <hi>VVomen</hi> have; and
what-ever they are, they may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
by Instruction; of which,
<hi>VVomen</hi> are no less capable than our
Selves.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Philosophers</hi> had followed this
Rule, in judging of all that concerns
<hi>VVomen,</hi> they would have spoken more
soundly; and had not (in Respect of
them) fallen into Ridiculous Absurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
But the most part, both of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
and Modern, having only built
their <hi>Philosophy</hi> upon popular Prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
and, having been in great Igno-rance
of themselves, it is no wonder, that
they have so far mistaken others.
Without giving our selves any trouble
to medle with the Antients; we may
say of the Modern, That the manner
how they are Taught (making them
believe, though falsly, That they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
become more knowing, than those
that have gone before them), renders
them Slaves to Antiquity, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines
them, to embrace (blindly) all
that they find therein, as Constant
and Universal Truths. And because,
that all that they say against <hi>VVomen,</hi>
is principally founded upon what
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:103324:102"/>
they have Read in the Antients; it
will not here be unprofitable, to relate
some of the most curious Conceits on
this Subject; which have been left to
us, by these Illustrious Dead, whose
very Ashes, and Rottenness, are at
this Day, held in so great Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plato</hi> (the Father of Antient <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy</hi>)
thanked the Gods for three
Favours, which they had bestowed on
him; but chiefly, for that he was
Born a <hi>Man,</hi> and not a <hi>VVoman.</hi> If
he had in his Eye their present Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
I should easily be of his Mind:
But that which makes me think, that
he had some-what else in his Thoughts,
is, The Doubt which he is said to have
been often in, If <hi>Women</hi> ought to be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in the Category of Beasts. That
may be sufficient to Rational Men, to
make him Condemn himself of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
or Brutishness; and totally to
degrade him from the Title of <hi>Divine,</hi>
which he enjoyes no more, but among
Pedants.</p>
               <p>His Scholar <hi>Aristotle</hi> (to whom the
Schools still continue the Name of the
Glorious Genious of Nature; upon a
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:103324:103"/>
Mistake, that he hath known her, better
than any other <hi>Philosopher</hi>) pretends,
that <hi>VVomen</hi> are but Monsters. Who
would not believe it, upon the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of so Renowned a Personage?
To say, It is an Impertinence; would
be, to choak his Supposition too open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p>If a <hi>VVoman</hi> (how Learned soever
she might be), had wrote as much
of <hi>Men,</hi> she would have lost all her
Credit; and <hi>Men</hi> would have ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
it sufficient, to have refuted such
a Foppery; by answering, That it must
be a <hi>VVoman,</hi> or a Fool, that had said
so. In the mean-while, she would
have had no less Reason, than this <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher.
VVomen</hi> are as Antient as <hi>Men;</hi>
We see them in as great Number;
and no <hi>Man</hi> is surprized to meet
<hi>them</hi> in his Way. To be a Monster
(according to the Opinion, it self, of
that Man) there must be something
Extraordinary, and Surprizing. <hi>VVo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>
have nothing of all that: They have
been alwayes made after the same
Fashion; alwayes Pretty and Witty.
And, if they be not made like <hi>Aristotle,</hi>
they may say, That <hi>Aristotle</hi> was not
made like <hi>them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:103324:103"/>
The Disciples of this Author (who
lived in the time of <hi>Philo</hi>), fell into
a Conceit, no less old Fashioned, in
regard of <hi>VVomen;</hi> fancying to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
(according to the Relation of
that <hi>Historian</hi>), That they were Half-Men,
or Imperfect Males. It is, without
doubt, because they have not the
Chin hung with a long beard; unless it
be that, I can apprehend nothing. The
<hi>Two Sexes</hi> (to be Perfect) ought to
be, as we see <hi>them.</hi> If the one were
altogether like the other, it would be
neither of the <hi>Two.</hi> If <hi>Men</hi> be the
Fathers of <hi>Women, Women</hi> are the
Mothers of <hi>Men;</hi> which, at least, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
them Equal: And we might have
as much Reason, as these <hi>Philosophers,</hi>
to say, That <hi>Men</hi> are Imperfect <hi>VVo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Socrates</hi> (who was the Morality and
Oracle of Antiquity) speaking of the
Beauty of that <hi>Sex;</hi> was accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to compare it to a Temple
of a Fair Show, but built upon a
Jakes.</p>
               <p>If this Conceit do not turn our Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks,
we must only Laugh at it. It
is propable, that he judged of the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:103324:104"/>
Bodies of others, by his own, or by
his Wives; who was a She-Devil,
which made him detest her; and, that
he spake of her <hi>Sex,</hi> to bring her down:
And, that he himself was mad to the
very soul, because he was ugly as a
Maggot.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Diogenes,</hi> Sir-named <hi>The Dog,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he was good at nothing but Bite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
seeing one day (in passing) two
<hi>VVomen,</hi> who Discoursed together;
told the Company, That there was
two Serpents, an Aspe and a Viper,
who Communicated to one another
their Poison. That Saying is worthy
of an Honest Man; and I wonder not,
that it is Ranked among the goodly
Philosophical Sentences. If the Wise
<hi>Men</hi> of <hi>Gottam</hi> had lived in his time,
it is certain, we should have found
their Ran-counters more sprightly.
The good <hi>Man</hi> was a little wounded;
and they that knew him a little, judged,
that (at that time) he had nothing else
to say.</p>
               <p>For the admirable and pleasant
<hi>Democritus;</hi> as he loved to be merry
and laugh a little, we must not take
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:103324:104"/>
every thing litterally which came from
his Mouth. He was a very tall <hi>Man;</hi>
and his Wife, one of the least: Being
one day asked, Why he had so ill
matched himself? He answered (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his ordinary Rallery), That
when we are obliged to choose, and
when there is nothing that is good to
be taken, the Least is alwayes the
Best. If the same Question had been
put to his Wife, she might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partied
with as much Reason; That
a little and a big Husband, being both
alike, the one as bad as the other,
she had taken her's hap Hazzard; for
fear, that if she had chosen, she might
have done worse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cato</hi> (the Sage and Severe Critick)
prayed often, That the Gods would par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
him, if he had been so Imprudent,
as to trust the least Secret to a <hi>VVo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi>
There stuck in the good <hi>Mans</hi>
Mind, a Famous Passage in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
History; which Antiquaries use
as a great Argument, to prove the little
Secresie of <hi>VVomen:</hi> A Child of twelve
Years of Age, being pressed by his
Mother, to tell her the Resolution of
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:103324:105"/>
he Senate (where he had been As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistant),
invented to baffle her; that
it had been decreed, That every Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
should have several Wives.
Immediately, she went and told her
Neighbours, to consult about her
Measures with them; So that, in the
space of half an Hour, it was all
the Town over. I would gladly
know, what a poor Husband would
do, if in a State, where <hi>VVomen</hi>
were the Mistresses (as in that of the
<hi>Amazones</hi>); one should come and
tell him, that it had been resolved in
Counsel, That every Husband must
have an Helper: without doubt, he
would not open his Mouth.</p>
               <p>These are some of the great and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime
Conceits, which they (whom
the Learned study as Oracles) have
entertained, concerning the Beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<hi>SEX:</hi> And that which is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant,
and odd, both together, is,
That Grave <hi>Men</hi> seriously make
use of that, which these Famous
Antients have often but said in
Drollery: So true it is, that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:103324:105"/>
and Pre-Occupation, do
make <hi>Men</hi> themselves mistake the
Mark, who pass for the most Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
Judicious, and Wife.</p>

            <p>THE strongest Objections that
can be made against us, are
drawn from the Authority of
great <hi>Men,</hi> and Holy <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:</hi>
As to the former, VVe think to
have sufficiently satisfied Them; by tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
them, That we acknowledge no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Authority here, but that of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and good Sense.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Scripture;</hi> it is not at all
contrary to the Intent of this <hi>Treatise,</hi>
if me understand (well) both the one and
the other. Here we pretend, That there
is an intire Equallity betwixt the Two
Sexes, being considered Independent of
of Custom; which placeth often those of
most Merit and Parts, in a Dependence
on others. The <hi>Scripture</hi> speaketh not
a word of Inequality: And, as the
end of it is only to serve <hi>Men</hi> for a
<pb facs="tcp:103324:106"/>
Rule in their Conduct, (according to
the Notions which it gives of Iustice);
So, it leaves to every one the Liberty, to
judge as well as he can of the natural
(and true) state of Things. And, if
we mind it, all the Objections which
are drawn there-from, are but Sophisms
of Prejudice; whereby sometimes, <hi>Men</hi>
understand (of all <hi>Women</hi>) Passages,
which only agree to some few in Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular:
Sometime they refer to Nature,
that which only flowes from Education
