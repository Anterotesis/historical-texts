            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

So that in thoſe things, without the ayde of externall information, reaſon can eaſily conclude the neceſſity of the effects and acts, from the conſtant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux, and vnchangable operation of their cauſe. But in all free Acts (and ſuch are all mans Actions) there is ſuch a variable contingencie, that a certain knowledge of their particulars can never bee attained, themſelues continuing <hi>Pro libitu</hi> for ever ſo vncertaine. Things that muſt be done, all men may knowe; but to thoſe things which either may, or may not be done, only the Actors, in whoſe liberty they are, are conſcious. Wherefore (becauſe of all humane actions, about which <hi>Iuſtice</hi> principally is converſant, there can bee in the <hi>Iudge</hi> no certaine knowledge demonſtratiue) God, for the better proceſſe of equity and right, hath allowed <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, a kinde of notice of their outward Acts, from the probability of externall teſtimonie. There is indeed aboue every ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>Teſt is intuens,</hi> a great and cleere-eyed witneſſe that viewes the heart and reynes, and fore-ſees our ſecreteſt actions before they come to Act. And there is too in every man, <hi>Teſtis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternus,</hi> an inward witneſſe, which wee can no more eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chew, then we can runne from our owne ſelues; That <hi>Conſcientia,</hi> that intimate &amp; ioynt-knowledge, or <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi> of our <hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Evill,</hi> ſo ſoone, yea in the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant it is done: And theſe two commonly, though they knowe moſt, ſpeake leaſt: <hi>God</hi> of his mercy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing, &amp; <hi>Conſcience</hi> bridled by him (in whoſe liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for a time it is) for that time not openly convincing or accuſing. But the third witneſſe is <hi>Extra Hominem,</hi> without the man: who, <hi>becauſe the ſpirit of man is onely conſcious of what is in man,</hi> (according to the Apoſtle) can ingender no certaine knowledge in vs, but a proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility

of truth by his accuſation; God frequently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth this his knowledge, in <hi>Vindication;</hi> conſcience hers, in <hi>Confeſsion;</hi> and our neighbour his, in <hi>Accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> God from his moſt infallible ſcience, both accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, ſo he did <hi>Ely.</hi> 1. Sam. 2. 29. and condemneth, as in the blaſpheamers caſe, Levit. 24. 14. and avengeth without either accuſation, or conviction. For firſt hee puniſhed <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and after told the cauſe, Ioſh. 7. 11. Then conſcience is the beſt evidence next God, and both accuſeth, as S. Iohn. 8. 9. and condemneth. Rom. 14. 22. But the outward witneſſe, <hi>the neighbour,</hi> onely can accuſe. So then, <hi>God</hi> is Witneſſe, Iury, and Iudge; <hi>Conſcience,</hi> Witneſſe and Iurie; but <hi>Man,</hi> the witneſſe <note place="margin">S. Th. Aquin. 2a 2ae. q. 70. art. 2.</note>only. Wherefore, becauſe the witneſſes accuſation, as being moſt infirme, breeds onely the vncertaine evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of probabilitie, God gradually betters and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes the truth of this probability, by the perſons multiplicity. If one onely accuſe, and one defend, it is probable the defendants anſwer may be as true as the Plaintiffes objection: but if two, or more witneſſe, and but one deny, the probability inclines to the part of the plaintiffe. Wherefore, <hi>at the mouth of two or three witneſſes ſhall the matter be eſtabliſhed.</hi> Deut. 19. 15. Two or three witneſſes, ſaith the old Teſtament, in the generality of caſes; and two or three witneſſes, ſaith the new, in an Elders accuſation at the leaſt, 1. Tim. 5. 19. And ſure I am, that if one had ſerued the turne, <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanna,</hi> who is now ſo celebrated for her vertue and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitie, had for her goodneſſe died, branded with the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracefull note of ſinne, and advoutries. One man hath but one ſoule; and therefore as conſcious of his owne thoughts, may bee irreuelably conſtant to his own vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanie: but two or more men haue as many ſoules, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:2026:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thoſe ſoules, as diverſe thoughts, &amp; thoſe thoughts, as various expreſſions. So that what one falſely averres for truth, the other as ignorant of his thoughts, may contradict. For if both thoſe witneſſes againſt <hi>Suſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> had had but one ſoule, and had conſequently beene conſcious each to others thoughts, both ſurely would haue ſtood to one tale; and the ſecond would never haue called that a <hi>Prime tree.</hi> Dan. 13. 58. which the forme had before averred to be a <hi>Lentiske.</hi> verſ. 54.
