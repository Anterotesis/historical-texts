            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

He had alſo two horſes, thone galyarde, luſty, and of a thycke tayle, thother leane, lyttell, and almoſte without a tayle. He appoynted the lyttell man, to pull of the great horſe tayle, the bygge and ſturdy ſoudiour to pull of thoſe few heares, that the leane horſe tayle hadde. The weake and feble man, vnto whom god and good education, had gyuen wyt in ſtrengthes place, pulled by .iiii. and by .v. heares at ones, and ſo within a ſhorte ſpace, he had made of a longe tayle no tayle. Thother a good yoma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s body, tugged at the hole taylle, and ſweatte faſte, but he pulled of not a heare. Nowe, yf the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant ſouldiours, were here thus taught, a handful of witte to be moch more worth than a horſelode of ſtrength, and were contente in battayle, that they ſhulde rule: whiche were the wyſer, they obey, that were the ſtronger, howe moche more ought we to be moued with this exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, ſpecyally in the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge of a comon welth, in makyng lawes, in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynge mattiers concernynge faythe and relygion, fynally in diſcuſſynge, what thynges maynteyne moſte the fauour of god towarde vs, and by what meanes a realme may beſt be kepte in welthynes?

            <p>¶The Romaynes after that they had wonne the citie of the Veiens, were at great contention, the commons of Rome, and many alſo of the gentylle menne, thoughte it very expediente, and hyghely profytable, that halfe Rome ſhoulde goo dwelle there, alledgyng, that many in Rome lacked, and that this citie was ryche, and of great welthyneſſe, gorgiouſly buylded, and alſo nigh vnto Rome, ſo that here many of them myght be enryched with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any diſturbance of them, that had poſſeſſions in Rome, ye and myght alſo, bycauſe they were ſo nyghe, be at al aſſemblees, all parlyamentes, that ſhulde be kepte in Rome. Marke what folowed: The ſenatours in eſpecial thoſe that were wyſeſt, in no caſe wolde aſſent to this, noo they thought it moche better to abyde all perylle, then any ſuche matier ſhoulde paſſe theyr handes. In ſo moche, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this was had in deliberation, and hotely

diſputed, the comons were ſo kendled agaynſt the Senatours, that it was harde to kepe them from goynge togyther by the eares. But what is it that ſage and graue perſones can not perſwade, if they be harde of them that vtterly lacke not diſcretion? A fewe of theſe ancient fathers and eſtemed ſena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, here ſtrayte brydled the rage of the people, and made them condeſcende vnto this, that all be it outwardely there ſemed gaynes in departynge, and loſſe in the abydynge at Rome, yet they ſhuld doo better to tary poore, than in goynge awaye to make them ſelfe ryche.</p>

The phiſition is called to do more good to other, then to hym ſelfe, and in dede oftymes he ſaueth the ſycke, and taketh the diſeaſe hym ſelfe, but yet he dieteth his pacient, not as the paciente deſyreth, but ſome tyme kepethe hym from meate, when he is hungry, ſome tyme from drynke, when he is ful thurſty, ſeldom geuynge hym that he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth for.

Many &amp; ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſeditions haue ben in Englande, they haue all ben ſoore punyſhed: this remedy helpeth but for a ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>¶Lucius Cinna, a noble man of Rome, conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and vtterly entended the deathe of Auguſtus the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perour. Ceſar had ſure knowlege, bothe where, when, and after what facion he purpoſed to bryng his treſon to paſſe. His intent was open, yet Ceſar long douted, what was beſt to be done. He thought to banyſſhe hym, he thoughte to doo nowe this, now that. As he thus toke delyberation, Liuia his wyfe came in, and after ſhe had perceiued the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier, ſayd thus vnto him: Sir, do as phiſitions do, whiche whan they ſee, that their accuſtomed medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines wyll not ſerue, they proue the contraryes. By punyſhment ye haue hitherto done lytel or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge, forgeue a nother whyle, and ſee what cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency may do. Cinna canne not nowe hurte your lyfe, he may ſet forth moche your honour. Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour thynkynge her counſayle not the worſt, by and by ſente for Cinna to come ſpeake with hym. As ſoone as Cinna was come, Themperour cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a chayre to be ſet for hym. Than thus he began to reaſon the mattier with Cinna. This one thing
<pb facs="tcp:22906:13"/>
ſaythe themperour, I muſte require of you, that you do not interrupte my communication, ye ſhall haue tyme, when I haue ſayde my mynde, to ſaye what ye wyll. Here he began to reherce his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fittes towarde Cinna. Firſt that he had perdoned hym his lyfe, whan that he founde hym in his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies tentis, and that he dyd reſtore him to his hole patrimony, that he had alſo gyuen hym great au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, many offices. If ye grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t all this, ſayth Ceſar, to be true, nowe I praye you tell me, what cauſe I haue gyuen you, to deſire my dethe? ye to go about your ſelfe to kylle me? Cinna here began to chaunge colour, to be troubled in cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenaunce, he wolde haue layde ſomwhat for his defence. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus made an ende of his expoſtulation, &amp; ſayde thus, Cinna, I gyue the ones ageyne thy lyfe: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I gaue the it, beinge myn ennemie, I giue it nowe to the, beinge a traytour, and a parricide. From this day forthwarde, lette frendeſhyp begin betwene vs, lette vs two contende, whyther thou mayſte ſhewe me more pleaſure, for perdonynge the thy lyfe, or I more gladde, that I ſaued the. And thus by and by Ceſar began with hym, and made hym conſul. Cinna was from that daye for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde, as true a frende vnto Ceſar, as one man myght be vnto an other, in ſo moche that he made Cinna his heyre.</p>
            <p>¶The kinge our moſte gracyous ſoueraine lorde myghte commemorate his benefyttes towarde all his ſubiectes. I wolde doo it for hym, but that I knowe I am farre vnmete, to take vppon me the
<pb facs="tcp:22906:14"/>
handelynge of ſoo weighty a mattier. His grace woll, I doubt not, folowe the clemency of Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus. He ſeeth, his noble progenytours haue ofte puniſhed rebelles, and done no more, but cut awey the branches of ſedicion, for their tyme. His high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes intendeth to pull aweye the roote. He ſeeth, it is not poſſible to cure this ſore, which in dede Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to calleth the greatteſt ſyckenes, that can come to a comune welthe, excepte he ſerche out, bothe where it ariſeth, and what thing moſte nouriſheth it, and then do as phiſicions are wont, whiche oft tymes laye not their medicines to the parte, that is diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but to that rather, from whens the diſeaſe firſt came, and is like to come ſtylle, oneleſſe it be there ſtopped. As for exaumple, when the eies be ſoore, firſt they ſeke, whether the diſeaſe grow in the eies, or is ſent from ſome other place nighe the eies, as from the heed, or els ſome other place further of, as the ſtomake. If it be not in the eies pri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cipally, but cometh either from the heed, or from the ſtomacke, they begynne not at the eies, but firſte pourge the ſtomacke, and ſo the roote cutte awaye, the diſeaſe nowe no more maynteyned, can in no wyſe longe tary behynde. It is very true, that Zamolſis, king of Thrace was wonte to ſaye. Loke, ſayth he, as the eies can not be clenſed, excepte ye fyrſte clenſe the heed, neyther the heed, without ye pourge the hole body, euen ſo, neither the bodye, without the mynde be firſte netted. This kynge ſawe it lytell auayled, to rydde the body of noughty humours, oneles alſo a man ſo brydell his appetyte, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde
<pb facs="tcp:22906:14"/>
he can forbeare ſuche thinges, as dydde hurte hym before, and wyll do ageyne, excepte he moderate his affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. The bote man I thinke, lacketh moche wyt, and loſeth moche labour, that ſtandeth all daye with a diſ ſhe ladinge out water, that nedes muſt come in agayne, oneles the bote be amended. The faut is in the breache of the bote, and not in the water. Surely, if it were any thing lyke to be brought to paſſe, it ſhulde be moche bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to fynde a waye, that none might haue wylle to rebell, then to truſſe vp rebellious people. Wolde god ſome high wytte, ſome man borne to do ſuche good for his countrey, coulde aſwel bryng this to paſſe, as I thinke it myght nowe very lyghtly be done. For if euer the cauſe of rebellion may vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be taken awaye, we haue a prynce, god wyll we maye haue his grace longe, we haue a prynce, that ſayth, the tyme is now. Al men ought to endeuour them ſelfe, here to occupie theyr wyttes, that ſuche a thynge myght take effecte. I for my parte, wylle do what I can, which I know is very lyttell, how be it if I do it not ſo well as my deſyre is, I truſte good intent ſhall ſoo make myne excuſe, that loue of my countrey ſhall not moche hurte me.</p>
            <p>¶Some ſay pouertie is the cauſe, that men come to be thenes, murderers, rebelles. But I thynke, nothynge ſo. For I knowe dyuers realmes, where pouertie raygneth moche more than in Englande, yet rebels there be none. The rote is lower, dygge deper, ye maye perchaunce fynde it. Education, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyll education, is a greatte cauſe of theſe and all
<pb facs="tcp:22906:15"/>
other myſchefes, that growe in a comune wel the. For where ſo many lacke honeſt occupatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by al men, that can not otherwiſe lyue by their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, ought to maynteyne them ſelues, howe canne we lacke any kynd of miſchief? No man is borne a craftis ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, youth muſt be beter brought vp, or euer the olde lyue welthely. The lacke, the lacke of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt craftes, and the habundauncie of ydlenes, all be it they be not the hole cauſe of ſedicyon, yet as they brede theues, murderers, and beggers, ſo not a lytle they prouoke men, or thynges lyke men to rebellion. There is a parte in man, whiche is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the mynde, that is of this nature, yf it be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyarde and luſty, either to do moche good, or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to do moche hurt. If this lacke good inſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if this be not handeled and ordered as it ſhulde be, men maye lacke ſedition, but they can not lacke a thynge within them to ſtyre them to ſedition. This muſt be ſo taught, that there be no rebellion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our ſelfes, we muſte conquere our luſtes, and compell the appetites, to obeye all ſuche ſtatutes, as reaſon and honeſtie ſhall thynke worthye to be enacted. Euery man, ſome wyll ſay, can not clyme to ſuche perfection, Euery man can not be kept at ſkole. I graunt, But yet I thynke, al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lordes ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and alſo the better parte of gentlemen, myght be as well brought vp, as it is neceſſary they be, if they had ſuche teachers, as oughte to inſtructe the nobles of a realme. Theſe wel brought vp, I wold nothynge doubte, but eyther we ſhulde be welthier than we be, or els moche better content with that,
<pb facs="tcp:22906:15"/>
that god ſhoulde ſende vs, all be it we had moche leſſe then nowe we haue. I longe haue ſuppoſed, that as the bryngyng vp of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nobles, is the ſaulfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde of a comune welthe, ſo theyr euill education is the ruyne therof. For as noble men be, ſo theyr ſeruantes are. The mayſter gyuen to ryot, the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant muſt nedes thynke, that there is no thriuyng for hym, excepte he ſhewe hym ſelfe a ruffler. So that though the ſeruaunt be good of hym ſelfe, yet to wynne the fauour of his mayſter, he muſte cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfaite their condicions, that his maiſter moſt ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth. Thus in vſynge theym a monethe or two, he maketh theym his owne. He nowe diſſembleth no lenger, he is as they be, whom he hath longe folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed. I muſt nedes ſaye more, if the nobles be euyl taught in poyntes concernyng religion, as if they be popyſhe, to put one exaumple for many, Howe can theyr ſeruauntes choſe, but be ſo to? Howe can theyr tenantes, whiche muſte haue theyr lordes fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, be of a nother religion, then theyr lorde is? Howe can they agre with their neighbours, if they bothe be not of one faythe and one beleue? The kynges grace ſhall neuer haue true ſubiectes, that do not beleue as his grace doth. For howe can they loue hym, as they ſhulde do, whiche beynge in er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours them ſelfe, in darkenes and ignorancy, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe his grace to be in a wronge faythe, and ſoo to ſeduce them, whiche entendeth nothynge ſo erneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as the ſauyng of their ſowles? Howe can theſe obey his highnes, as it behoueth them to do, whan they thynke in obeyenge his commaundementes,
<pb facs="tcp:22906:16"/>
they diſobey goddis. This foreyne heed, that is in Rome, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body being in England, hath brought the ſely braynes of many a poore manne, into depe er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours. Alas what greatter ignorauncye can there be, then to take hym for hede, that neuer was with the body? Hym for the heed, that hitherto hath done nothynge, but conſumed the membres? The kyng is our heed, though popyſhe ſay nay, yet lette vs beleue the prophete Samuel, Lo ſaythe he vnto kynge Saul, God hathe anoynted the, and made the prince of all his inheritance. I pray you, think you that prieſtes, monkes, friers, and byſhops, be not a parte of goddis inheritaunce? Hath god no tytle, no right vnto them? If god haue, the kynge alſo, whom god hath made his holle heyre, muſte nedes haue. He is theyr prynce, and yet not heade, ſome ſay. Samuell is a prophete, he ſayth yes, he ſaythe vnto Saule, <hi>Nonne cum paruulus eſses</hi>

I ſhal ſpeke of this matyer perchaunce a nother tyme, at more leyſure, And in place more conueniente. Nowe I wyll not go from my purpoſe. We muſte agree in
<pb facs="tcp:22906:16"/>
in religion, we muſt ſerue but one mayſter, one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy wyll haue but one heed. It is not poſſible men to agree longe, that diſſent in relygion. No more than it is poſſyble, chriſten men to agree with tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes. Howe be it, who wyll not thynke it moch bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to diſſent, then that we all agree, vpon perny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious errours? Whiche haue noo defence but this onely, that they haue reygned long, and that men hath long ben ſubiecteto them? The nobles muſte be of one beleue, of one fayth, of one religion, they muſt all agre vpon one heed. The gentylmen wyll folowe, the comunes can not tary longe behynde. And where I ſayde before, youthe muſte be welle brought vp, ſpecially in opinions of religion, here I ſay, the olde muſte begynne. It is harde for the ſonne to be agaynſt his father, in matters of faith. No, we ſe this thynge onely to be a defence for all argumentes: I beleue as my father did before me. Vndoubtedly, if the child lerne one thyng at ſcole, or of the preacher, and here his father at home, not onely ſaye, but ſee hym alſo doo the contrary, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des are forgotten, dayly exaumple worketh faſte, ſpecially when it is euylle. Clitipho ſaythe, as all yonge menne wylle ſaye, My father byddeth me lerne of other honeſt me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, what becometh me to do, he commaundeth me to folowe them, but when he hath well dronke, what ſhamfull actes dothe he tel of hym ſelfe? when he ſayth, he hath doone thus, Can I thynke vppon that he byddeth me do? and not ſooner do as he hath done? No no he telleth a tale, to one that hath no eares, that commaundeth
<pb facs="tcp:22906:17"/>
the yonge to do well, when they ſee the aged do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyll. I haue ofte meruailed, to ſee the diligencye, that the Iewes vſe in bringynge vp their youthe, and bene moche aſſhamed to ſee howe neglygente chriſten men are in ſoo godly a thynge. There is neyther man, woman, nor chyld of any lauful age, but he for the mooſte parte knowethe the lawes of Moyſes: and with vs he is almoſt a good curate, that knoweth .vi. or .vii. of the .x. commandemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes: amonges the Iewes, there is not one, but he can by ſome honeſte occupation, gette his lyuyng. There be fewe idell, none at al, but ſuch as be riche ynough, and may lyue without labour. There is not one begger amonges the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. All the cities of Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, many places in Eecilia, many bourges in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, haue a great nombre of Iewes in them. I haue ben longe amonges them, that are in Italy, I neuer harde of a Iewe, that was a thefe, neuer that was a murderer. No I neuer hard of a fraye betwene them. I am aſhamed to ſaye as I nedes muſte ſaye, They maye well thynke their religion better than ours, if religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be tried by mens lyues. Nowe if Moyſes lawe lerned in youthe, and but carnally vnderſtande, can ſo ſteye them, that fewe or none fall into other vice, than vſury, whiche al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo they do thynke permytted by Moyſes lawe, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they vſe it not one iewe to an other, as in dede they do not, but a Iewe to a ſtraunger. Might not we lerne ſo moche of Chriſtis lawe, as were able to kepe vs from rebellion? Maye not poore mennes chyldren come to the ſermons? maye they nothere preachers?
<pb facs="tcp:22906:17"/>
can they here goddis lawes, ye though they be but eaſily preached, and not abhorre ſedycyon and rebellion? Who harde euer, that the Turkes roſe againſt their prince? it is, it is vndoubted, one ſorte of relygion, though alſo it be not ryght, that kepeth men in concorde and vnytie. Turkes goo not agayne turkes, nor Iewes agaynſte Iewes, becauſe they bothe agree in theyr faythe. Chriſten men do ſo varye, Englande is ſo deuyded, that I wonder rather that ſedicion ſprange vp no ſooner, than that nowe men begyn to rebell. Englande is lyttell bounde vnto them, that at the fyrſt deuyded it ſo madly. This North and ſouth, eaſt and weſt, is a good particion of the hole worlde, it were wel in Englande, if we were all called Englyſhemen, of this countrey, or that, as of Yorke, of London, and ſuche other: and not theſe northern men, theſe ſoutherne, theſe weſtern. The very name maketh fooles out with theym, that they neuer ſawe. The northorn can not but beare haulfe a grudge to the ſouthern, ye for no nother cauſe, then that they be thus called. In Italie, Fraunce, Spayne, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, there is both north and ſouthe, eſt and weſt, yet they iudge nothynge by theſe, but the wynde. In Oxford I know the name of the northorn and ſouthorne proctour, hath ben the cauſe, that many men haue ben ſlayne. They that ſhulde rule tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, are out or euer they entre into their office. We can not get out of Paules churche, but we muſte paſſe by the northorn dore, or by the ſouthern. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten men are to ſoore diuided. The fryers of ſaynt
<pb facs="tcp:22906:18"/>
Fraunces ſkace loue the domynycans, the Iaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites loue not the Brigetines, or if they doo loue, they wolde loue moche better, if they were al of one ſort. I do knowe, good men, of what order ſo euer they be, they wyll do well. But the euyll be mo in nombre, they bere the ſwynge: thother be ſofewe that ſkace they be ſene in the chapiter howſe. It is only Chriſtis religion, that can make Chriſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men one of vs loue an other, as we ſhulde do. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptes of philoſophie, and good education, coude make many of the Grecians, mo of the Romans, not only to forſake riches, to banyſhe pleaſures, &amp; to put them ſelfes in a thouſande perilles: but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to dye for their cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey. And can not the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of the worde of god, the ſwete adhortations, the hyghe and aſſured promyſes that god maketh vnto vs, kepe chriſten men from contempning the iudgemente and lawes of god, frome vndoinge theyr cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey, from fyghtyng againſt theyr prince? If we were any thing wel inſtructed in the ioyes, that are prepared for them, that obey god and their prynce, in the ioyes that neyther mans eloquence can expreſſe, neyther harte fele, nor thought com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe: Who wyll thinke, that ſoo many of theym coude ſo frankely offre vp theyr liues, and that we ſhall not abhorre, ſuche as eyther wyll dye theym ſelfe, or bringe their countreye to ruine?</p>
            <p>¶Who can prayſe Themiſtocles ſoo well, but he maye ſeme to haue lefte out a greatte parte of his prayſe? Who dyd more for his countreye then he? Who coude be worſe rewarded then he was? that

was not only banyſhed his countrey, but alſo dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to ſeke ſuccour at Xerxes hande, whom he had not longe before diſhonored in batayle? who had a greatter cauſe to fall out with his countrey than he? who more commoditie to haue reuenged ſuche ingratitude? But ſe what good education can do? Se what is to be loked for of them, in whoſe bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtis vertue and deſyre of honeſte fame lodgeth. Xerxes interteyned hym highely, and ſhewed him all the fauour, that a myghtie prynce could ſhewe vnto one, whom he beſt loued.

Yet al this being thus, when Xerxes wold haue ſent hym agaynſt his countrey, with an hoſte of men, he forgot all theyr vnkynde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, he forgot they had exyled him, and put him in ieoperdy of his lyfe, and thought it moche better to ſlee hym ſelfe, than to be a capitayne agaynſte his countrey.

I wyll not ſpeake of Thraſſibulus, Codrus, Ancurus, Decii, and manye other, whiche all thought the welthe of theyr countrey, to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to their lyues. I can not thinke, but if Chriſtis lawes were well preached, (they be well preached, whan the preacher ſayth as the goſpel is, and doth as the goſpell ſaith) I can not thinke, but if Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtis

Goddis worde is potente, and to ſaye as I thynke, almoſt omnipotent, if it be well handeled, and of ſuche as it ſhulde be. It is moch that good men maye do. In Florence, the people were ſet parte agaynſte parte, as we were latelye here in Englande. The ſyde that hadde the better hande, came to ſet a fyre the palaice of their aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries Capitayne, called Pagolantonio Soderi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni.

There was none ſo lewde, that coulde in ſo honeſte a prelates preſence do any hurte. This Machiauellus wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, as a thynge wonderfull, howe be it, if people were as obedient as they ought to be, and byſhops in ſuche reuerence as they haue ben in tymes paſt, for their good lyfe and lernynge, this wolde be no wonder. who was leſſe beloued in the northe, than my lorde Cardynall, god haue his ſowle, before he was amonges them? Who better be loued, after he had ben there a whyle? we hate oft tymes, whom we haue good cauſe to loue. It is a wonder, to ſee howe they were turned, howe of vtter ennemyes, they became his dere frendes. He gaue byſhops a

There was fewe holy dayes, but he wolde ride .v. or .vi. myle from his howſe, nowe to this paryſhe churche, nowe to that, and there cauſe one or other of his doctours, to make a ſermone vnto the people. He ſat amonges them, and ſayd maſſe before al the paryſhe. He ſawe why churches were made. He began to reſtore them to their ryght and propre vſe. If our byſhops had done ſo, we ſhuld haue ſene that preachyng of the goſpell, is not the cauſe of ſedition, but rather lacke of preachyng of it. He broughte his dinner with hym, and bad dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of the pariſh to it. He enquired whether there was any debate or grudge betwene any of theym, yf there were, after dinner he ſente for the parties to the church, and made them at one. Men ſay wel that do wel. Goddis lawes ſhal neuer be ſo ſet by, as they ought, before they be well knowen. Howe ſhall poore men knowe them, excepte they be ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely preached?

Other men, that are borne in bare countreys, and can not lyue, onles they moche trauayle the world, auoyde myſerie by their great labour and toyle. In Englande the grounde almoſte nouriſheth vs alone. It is an incredible thynge, to ſee howe ſore men of other nations labour, howe moch we play, howe lytle they conſume on their belyes, howe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che we deuoure, howe poore they be, and how wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy we are, welthy I ſaye in compariſon of them. God hath gyuen vs to good a countrey, we maye here to many of vs lyue ydle. In many places of Germany, people are fayne to ſet theyr trees, that they vſe for theyr fewel.
