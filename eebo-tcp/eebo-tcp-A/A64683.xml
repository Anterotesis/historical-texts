         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Strange and Remarkable Predictions of that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Learned, and excellent Bishop, James
Usher late Lord Primate of Ireland.</head>
            <p>THe Author of the Life of this Excellent and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Primate and Arch-Bishop, gives an Account,
that among other extraordinary gifts and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
which it pleased the Almighty to bestow
upon him, he was wonderfully endued with a Spirit of
Prophecy, whereby he gave out several true Predictions
and Prophesies of things a great while before they came to
pass, whereof some we have seen fulfilled, and others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
yet to be accomplished. And though he was one that
abhor'd Enthusiastick Notions, being too Learned, Rational,
and knowing, to admit of such idle Freaks and Whimsies.
Yet he profest, <q>That several times in his Life he had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things imprest upon his mind, concerning future Events,
with so much warmness and importunity, that he was not
able to keep them secret, but lay under an unavoidable
necessity to make them known.</q>
            </p>
            <p>From which Spirit he foretold the <hi>Irish</hi> Rebellion Forty
years before it came to pass, with the very time when it
should break forth, in a Sermon Preached in <hi>Dublin</hi> in 1601.
where from <hi>Ezek<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 4. 6. discoursing concerning the Prophets
bearing the iniquity of <hi>Judah</hi> forty days, the Lord therein
appointed a day for a year: he made this direct Applycation
in Relation to the connivance at Popery at that time. <hi>From
this year</hi> (says he) <hi>will I reckon the sin of</hi> Ireland, <hi>that those
whom you now imbrace, shall be your Ruin, and you shall bear this
Iniquity.</hi> Which Prediction proved exactly ture, for from
that time 1601, to the year 1641, was just Forty years, in
which it is notoriously known, that the Rebellion and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of <hi>Ireland</hi> happened, which was acted by those
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97375:2"/>
Popish Priests, and other Papists, which were then connived
at. And of this Sermon the Bishop reserved the Notes, and
put a Note thereof in the Margent of his Bible; and for
20 Years before, he still lived in the Expectation of the Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling
thereof: And the nearer the Time was, the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
he was, that it was near Accomplishment, though there
was no visible appearance of any such thing: And (sayes Dr.
<hi>Bernard</hi>) the Year before the Rebellion broke forth, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
taking his leave of me, being then going from <hi>Ireland</hi> to
<hi>England,</hi> he advised me to a serious Preparation; for I should
see heavy Sorrows and Miseries, before I saw him again;
which he delivered with as great Confidence, as if he had seen
it with his Eyes: Which seems to verify that of the Prophet,
<hi>Amos 3. 7. Surely, the Lord will do nothing, but he will reveal it
to his Servants, the Prophets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this Spirit of Prophesie, he fore-saw the Changes and
Miseries of <hi>England</hi> in Church and State; for having in one
of his Books, (called <hi>De Prim, Eccl. Brit.</hi>) given a larg account
of the Destruction of the Church and State of the <hi>Brittains,</hi>
by the <hi>Saxons,</hi> about 550 Years after Christ: He gives this
among other Reasons, why he insisted so largely upon it;
That he fore-saw, that a like Judgment was yet behind, if time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Repentance and Reformation did not prevent it: And he
would often Mourn upon the Fore-sight of this, long before it
came.</p>
            <p>From this Spirit he gave Mournful Intimations of the
Death of our late Soveraign, <hi>Charles</hi> the First; of whom he
would be often speaking with Fear and Trembling, even when
the King had the greatest Success: And would therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
pray, and gave all advice possible, to prevent any such
thing.</p>
            <p>From this Spirit he fore-saw his own Poverty in worldly
things; and this he would often speak of, with admiration to
the Hearers, when he was in his greatest Prosperity; which
the Event did most certainly verify.</p>
            <p>From this Spirit he Predicted the Divisions and Confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in <hi>England</hi> in Matters of Religion, and the sad conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
thereof; some of which we have seen fulfill'd: And
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97375:3"/>
I pray God, the rest which he feared, may not also be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished
upon us.</p>
            <p>Lastly, From this Spirit he fore-told, That the greatest
stroke upon the Reformed Churches was yet to come; and
that the time of the utter Ruin of the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> should be
when she thought her self most secure: And as to this Last, I
shall add a brief Account from the Persons own hand, who
was concerned therein; which followeth in these Words:</p>
            <p>The Year before this Learned and Holy Primate, A. Bishop
<hi>Usher</hi> dyed, I went to him, and earnestly desired him, to give
me in Writing his Apprehensions concerning Justification, and
Sanctification by Christ; because I had formerly heard him
Preach upon those Points, wherein he seemed to make those
great Mysteries more intelligible to my mean Capacity, than
any thing which I had ever heard from any other: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I had but an imperfect and confused Remembrance of
the Particulars, I took the boldness to importune him, that
he would please to give a brief account of them in Writing;
whereby I might the better imprint them in my Memory;
of which he would willingly have excused himself, by declaring
his intentions of not writing any more: Adding, That if he
did write any thing, it should not exceed above a Sheet or
two: But upon my continued Importunity, I at last obtained
his Promise.</p>
            <p>He coming to Town some time after, was pleased to give
me a Visit at my own House; where I failed not to challenge
the Benefit of the Promise he had made me: He replyed;
<hi>That he had not writ, and yet he could not charge himself with any
Breach of Promise: For</hi> (said he) <hi>I did begin to write; but when
I came to write of Sanctification, that is, of the New Creature, which
God formeth by his Spirit in every Soul, which he doth truly Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
I found so little of it wrought in my self, that I could speak
of it only as Parrots by Rote, &amp; without the knowledge &amp; under
standing of what I might have exprest; &amp; therefore, I durst not
presume to proceed any further upon it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when I seemed to stand amazed, to hear such an Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Confession from so great and experienced a Christian,
He added; <hi>I must tell you, We do not well understand what San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97375:3"/>
and the New Creature are; It is no less then for a man
to be brought to an entire Resignation of his will to the will of God,
and to live in the Offering up of his Soul continually in the flames
of Love, as a whole burnt Offering to Christ, and how little</hi> (says
he) <hi>are many of those who profess Christianity experimentally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with this work on their Souls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this Discourse, I conceived he had very excellently
and clearly discovered to me that part of Sanctification
which he was unwilling to write.</p>
            <p>I then presumed to enquire of him what his present ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
were concerning a very great Persecution which
should fall upon the Church of God in these Nations of
<hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> of which this Reverend Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
had spoken with great confidence many years before,
when we were in the highest and fullest state of outward
Peace and Settlement. I asked him whether he did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
those sad times to be past, or that they were yet to
come, To which he answered, <hi>That they were yet to come, and
that he did as confidently expect it, as ever he had done,</hi> adding,
<hi>That this sad Persecution would fall upon all the Protestant Churches
of Europe;</hi> I replyed, That I did hope it might have been
past as to these Nations of ours, since I thought, that though
we, who are the People thereof, have been punished much
less than our sins have deserved, and that our late Wars
had made far less devastations, then War commonly brings
upon those Countries where it pleaseth God in Judgement
to suffer it; yet we must needs acknowledge, that many
great Houses had been Burnt, Ruined, and left without In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants,
many great Families impoverished and undone,
and many Thousand Lives also had been lost in that bloody
War, and that <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> as well as <hi>England,</hi> had
drunk very deep of the Cup of Gods Anger, even to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow
of the Government, and the utter Desolation al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
of a very great part of those Countries.</p>
            <p>But this Holy man, turning to me, and fixing his Eyes
upon me with that serious and ireful look which he usually
had when he spake Gods word and not his own; and when
the Power of God seemed to be upon him, and to constrain
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:97375:4"/>
him to speak, which I could easily discern much to differ
from the countenance where with he usually spake to me;
He said thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fool not your self with such hopes, for I tell you, all you have yet
seen, hath been but the beginning of sorrows to what is yet to come
upon the</hi> Protestant <hi>Churches of Christ, who will ere long fall under
a sharper Persecution than ever yet has upon them; and therefore</hi>
(said he to me) <hi>look you be not found in the Outward Court, but a
worshipper in the Temple before the Altar, for Christ will measure
all those that profess his Name, &amp; call themselves his People; &amp; the
Outward worshippers he will leave out, to be trodden down by the
Gentiles. The Outward Court</hi> (says he) <hi>is the formal Christian,
whose Religion lies in performing the outside duties of Christianity,
without having an inward Life &amp; Power of Faith and love, uniting
them to Christ, and these God will leave to be trodden down, and
swept away by the Gentiles; But the worshippers within the Temple
and before the Altar, are those who do indeed worship God in Spirit
and in Truth, whose Souls are made his Temples, and he is honoured
and adored in the most inward thoughts of their hearts, and they
Sacrifice their Lusts and vile affections, yea, and their own wills to
him; and these God will hide in the hollow of his Hand, and under
the shadow of his wings; and this shall be one great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
this last, and all the other preceding Persecutions; For in
the former, the most eminent and spiritual Ministers and Christians
did generally suffer most, and were most violently fallen upon, but in
this last Persecution, these shall be preserved by God as a Seed to
partake of that Glory which shall immediately follow and come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Church, as soon as ever this storm shall be over; for as it shall
be the sharpest, so it shall be the shortest Persecution of them all;
and shall only take away the gross Hypocrites and formal Profe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sors,
but the true Spiritual Believers shall be preserved till the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity
be over-past.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I then asked him by what means or Instruments this great
Tryal should be brought on. He answered, By <hi>the Papists;</hi>
I replyed, that it seemed to me very improbable they
should be able to do it, since they were now little countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
and but few in these Nations, and that the hearts of the
People were more set against them then ever since the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97375:4"/>
He answered again, <q>That it would be by the
hands of <hi>Papists,</hi> and in the way of a suddain Massacree;
and that the then Pope should be the chief Instrument of it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>All this he Spake with so great Assurance, and with the
same serious and concerned Countenance, which I have
before observed him to have<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when I have heard him soretell
some things which in all humane appearence were very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely
to come to pass, which yet I my self have lived to see
happen according to his prediction, and this made me give
the more earnest attention to what he then uttered.</p>
            <p>He then added, <q>That the Papists were in his Opinion the
<hi>Gentiles</hi> spoken of in the 11th of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> to whom
the outward Court should be left, that they might tread
it underfoot; They having received the <hi>Gentiles</hi> worship
in their adoring Images, and Saints departed, and in
taking to themselves many Mediators; And this
(Said he) the <hi>Papists</hi> are now designing among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and therefore be sure you be ready.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This was the Substance, &amp; I think (for the greatest part)
the very same words which this Holy man spake to me at
the time beforementioned not long before his death, and
which I writ down, that so great and notable a Prediction
might not be lost and forgotten by my self nor others.</p>
            <p>This gracious Man repeated the same things in Substance
to his only daughter the Lady <hi>Tyrril,</hi> and that with many
tears, and much about the same time that he had exprest
what is aforesaid to me, and which the Lady <hi>Tyrril</hi> assured
me of with her own mouth, to this purpose.</p>
            <p>That opening the Door of his Chamber, She found him
with his Eyes lift up to Heaven, and the tears running a pace
down his Cheeks, and that he seemed to be in an Extasie,
wherein he continued for about half an hour, not taking
the least notice of her, though she came into the Room, but
at last turning to her, he told her, That his thoughts had
been taken up about the Miseries and Persecutions that were
coming upon the Churches of Christ, which would be so
sharp <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>d bitter, that the contemplation of them had fetched
those Tears from his Eyes, and that he hoped he should not
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:97375:5"/>
live to see it, but possibly she might, for it was even at the
door; <hi>Therefore take heed</hi> (says he) <hi>that you be not found
sleeping.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The same things he also Repeated to the Lady <hi>Bysse,</hi>
Wife to the present Lord Chief Baron of <hi>Ireland,</hi> but with
adding this circumstance, That if they brought back the
King, it might be delayed a little longer, but (sayd he)
<hi>It will surely come, therefore be sure to look that you be not found
unprepared for it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude in the words of Dr. <hi>Bernard,</hi> speaking of this
Excellent Person. <q>Now howsoever I am as far from heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Prophesies this way as any, yet with me it is not
Improbable, that so great a Prophet, so sanctified from his
youth, so knowing &amp; eminent throughout the Universal
Church, might have at some special times more then Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Motions and Impulses in doing the watchmans part,
of giving warning of Judgments approaching.</q>
