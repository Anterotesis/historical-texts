            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE CATHOLIQVE READER HEALTH, AND ENCOVRAGEMENT in his Holy Fayth.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Ourteous Reader before thou peruſe this litle Booke, I would intreate thee, to reade theſe enſuing points very neceſſary to ſerue thy ſelfe of, with fruit and profit.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The firſt point is,</hi> that in the Textes of Scriptures alledged throghout this Treatiſe, it is not ſpecified out of which English Bible, the ſaid paſſages are extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:173416:4"/>
for as much, as this were ouer troubleſome vnto thee, ſith En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland hath ſet forth within theſe few yeares paſt, a great number of ſeuerall ſorts of Bibles, much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring one from another; So that our Aduerſaries (to whome I wiſh from very hart, as I do to thee, that this litle Booke may prooue profitable) haue not all one ſort of Bibles themſelues. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding know for certaine, that they are all faithfully taken forth of the Bibles <hi>in quarto, &amp; octauo,</hi> printed at London by <hi>Robert Barker,</hi> anno 1615. So as if by chance any one ſhall ſhew thee ſome other Bible wherein they be not ſet downe, word, for word, as heere thou findeſt; yet reſt aſſured, and out of doubt, that thou ſhalt find them ſo written, &amp; faithfully cited
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:173416:4"/>
out of the foreſaid Edition of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Barker,</hi> ſet forth by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties ſpeciall Commandement.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The ſecond point is,</hi> That thou admire the ſple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dor of Truth, the which is ſuch, and ſo paſſing bright, that notwithſtanding our Aduerſaries mayne, and ſerious endeauours to obſcure the ſame, by ſo many varieties of Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; by ſuch a number of groſſe corruptions and falſifications; yet neuertheles their condemnation is ſo expreſſely ſet downe in this their owne Bible, and is ſo cleere to all the world, that nothing els is needfull heerto, but that thou know to reade, and haue thine eyes to behold the ſame, at the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this their Booke. This cannot chooſe but be an exceeding comfort vnto Catholikes agaynſt
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:173416:5"/>
their Aduerſaries, concerning the vprightnes of their cauſe, to offer to be tryed, and to confound them by their owne Bible: the Tranſlation whereof, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding doth in a number of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and particularly in many of thoſe that are in queſtion, ſwarue and differ notoriouſly from the authenticall Latin, and to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible diſparagement, darkning, and obſcuring of the Catholique cauſe. Neuer did yet (nor I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume dare) our Aduerſaries offer to giue the like aduantage vnto vs, as to ſtand to be tried by our Tranſlations, and that in aboue fifty maine Heads, and Points of Doctrine, that are this day in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſy between vs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The third point is,</hi> That when thou ſhalt vrge, or alleadge
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:173416:5"/>
any paſſage, in fauour of thine owne faith and doctrine; if any one returne their charge, be it by way of recrimination and blaming of the Roman Church, or by allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging ſome obſcure texts, and thoſe ill vnderſtoode, to counterpoyze ſuch as are brought by thee; do thou ſhew them amiably, that this is not to proceed in due order, nor to deale with thee as they ought, in opoſing a paſſage darke, &amp; obſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, to confund another that is moſt cleare and euident. For example, when we ſet before their eies theſe few words (as cleare as the Sunne at Noone day) <hi>Take, eate, this is my body, this is my bloud which ſhall be ſhed for you &amp;c.</hi> (Marc. 14.25.) they will ſtraight ſuppoſe to haue found another important place, yea, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:173416:6"/>
to haue giuen vnto vs the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, if they preſently do reply, that our Sauiour ſaith in S. Iohn 6.63. <hi>The fleſh profiteth nothing, the wordes that I ſpeake vnto you, they are ſpirit, and they are life;</hi> a paſſage far more obſcure, then that which is in queſtion, &amp; which affirmeth nothing leſſe, then that which they pretend to prooue therby. For how abſurd were it to ſay, that the fleſh of Chriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth nothing? And if (as they themſelues ſay) we muſt interpret one paſſage by another, then doubtles it is better to explicate an obſcure one, by one that is clere, then one that is cleere, by a paſſage obſcure: and that one text giue place to many, rather then many giue place to one.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>The fourth point is,</hi> That if
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:173416:6"/>
they ſhall reiect any of the paſſages which thou produceſt, pretending the ſame to be <hi>Apocriphall;</hi> know that to preuent this obiection, no ſuch Scriptures as they cal <hi>Apocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phall</hi> are here produced alone, but that allwayes there goe accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with them others that be <hi>Canonicall,</hi> euen by their owne confeſſion: and ſo far forth as <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criphall</hi> Scriptures, ſhall, and do agree with <hi>Canonicall,</hi> they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, by their owne Rule, are bound to receiue them. Which will alſo ſtop their mouth, in their common pretence of Conference of places; for rarely haſt thou heere leſſe then three, or foure ſeuerall paſſages cited at large (beſides references) for the proofe of euery ſeuerall point: All our Aduerſaries put togeather, being neuer able,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:173416:7"/>
in their defence, to do the like; that is, to produce ſo many in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſo expreſſe and cleere, and for ſo great a number of Controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, as are heere diſputed, and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in ſo litle a Treatiſe.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>The fift point is,</hi> that if they ſhall contend with thee, not about the wordes themſelues, as being cleere, but about the ſenſe and meaning of them; for ſuch places, I ſay, as may be ſubiect to this ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, thou ſhalt forthwith haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe vnto that which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures call, <hi>The Rule of Faith,</hi> to wit, vnto the euer-conſtant and vniforme Iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Church and Ancient Fathers, who in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry age ſince Chriſt, haue vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the points in queſtion, in that ſenſe which Catholiques do. An example wherof thou maiſt
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:173416:7"/>
lay downe before them, out of that learned Treatiſe, intituled, <hi>The Summary of Controuerſies,</hi> debating the queſtion of the <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Sacrament.</hi> Which thou ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing done, bid them do the like, and thou wilt yield vnto them; (a thing which they can neuer do in their defence.) So as, no man of reaſon will reiect this <hi>Rule,</hi> groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſo cleerly in holy Scripture, and preferre the priuate interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of ſome ſilly Cobler before <hi>S. Chryſostome,</hi> of a Baker before <hi>S. Baſill,</hi> of ſome Tinker before <hi>Tertullian,</hi> or of any Nouelliſt whatſoeuer, before the iudgement of the Church, and the whole ſtreame of ancient Fathers.</p>
            <p>This point therfore being <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> important, ſhall be the firſt, which I will fortify, and proue by the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:173416:8"/>
word of God in this preſent Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, I meane this <hi>Rule;</hi> and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in no wiſe forget, allwayes to inuolue thine Aduerſary within this <hi>Rule,</hi> as often as he ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo vnruly, and thou ſhalt be ſure to get the victory.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>The ſixt, &amp; laſt point is,</hi> That I heere proteſt, in the preſence of God (whome I call to witnes in this behalfe, and pray thee alſo to call vpon, for the ſaluation and reduction of all thoſe that walke aſtray) that it is not in the power of any one, no not of all our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries that are in England, to find in their owne Bible, one only expreſſe Text, I ſay <hi>one only,</hi> I ſay, <hi>in their owne Bible,</hi> by which they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> poſſibly proue, <hi>one only</hi> point of their falſe Doctrine, without their vſuall art of adding, diminiſhing,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:173416:8"/>
chopping or changing it by ſome interpretation, or other: which yet ſhould be to alter the Text it ſelfe, and to employ mans fancy, inſteed of the pure word; a thing by their owne Confeſſion, flatly forbidden vnto them, proteſting, that the <hi>Word of God,</hi> doth in ſuch ſort containe all that which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſaluation, that it is not lawfull neither for men, nor An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells, to adde, diminiſh, or alter ought therof; and commanding their followers and adherents, vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly to renounce all Antiquity, Cuſtome, Multitude, Humane, Wiſedome, Iudgement, Decrees, Edicts, Counſailes, Viſions, yea and Miracles themſelues, to the contrary.</p>

Cor. 37. <hi>He that ſtandeth stedfaiſt in his hart, hauing no neceſſity, but hath power ouer his owne will, and hath ſo decreed in his hart that he will keep his virgin, doth well.</hi> But if a man haue not free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of will, as well to the one, as to the other, why doth the holy Ghoſt (Prou. 23.26.) require of vs to giue him our hart, if we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conſent but vnto euill? Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is in our power to chooſe good, or euill.</p>

               <p>Luc. 11.27.28. <hi>Bleſſed is the wombe that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast ſucked. But he ſayd; Yea rather, bleſſed are they that heare the word of God, and keepe it.</hi> Chriſt pronounceth them bleſſed, who heare the word of God &amp; keep it: but the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements are the word of God (which they affirme no man can keep) therefore they affirme that no man can be bleſſed. And like vnto this is that of Iohn 13.17. Matt. 12.50. Iohn 14.23. with an infinite number of ſuch like pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, in their owne Bible: with all

And Chriſt, ſaying to the young man in the Ghoſpell:
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:173416:47"/>
If thou wilt enter into heauen' keepe the Commandements, is as much as if he had ſaid; If thou wilt enter into heauen, take hold of the Moone betweene thy teeth.</p>

                  <hi>XLVII.</hi> That there is no Purgatory fire, or other priſon, wher in ſinnes may be ſatisfied for, after this life.</head>
               <p>COntrary to the expreſſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of their owne Bible. 1. Cor. 3.13.15. <hi>The fire ſhall try euery mans worke, of what ſort it is. If any mans worke ſhal be burnt, he ſhall ſuffer loſſe, but he himſelfe ſhall be ſaued, yet ſo, as by fire.</hi> S. Auguſtine writing vpon the 37. Pſalme, and drawing theſe very wordes of the Apoſtle into his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, ſayth: <hi>Becauſe it is ſaid (he himſelfe ſhall be ſafe) that fire is
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:173416:88" rendition="simple:additions"/>
therfore contemned. Yea verily, though ſafe by fire, yet that fire ſhall be more grieuous then whatſoeuer a man can ſuffer in this life.</hi> Thus he. Therfore there is a Purgatory fire, wherein ſinnes may be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for after his life.</p>
               <p>Iohn 11.22. <hi>But I know, that euen now, whatſoeuer thou wilt aske of God. God will giue it thee.</hi> S. Martha, the ſiſter of S. Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen belieued, that our Lord (whom then, ſhe held only for a holy man or Prophet, and not for the Sonne of God) could obtaine of God, ſomething profitable to her brother Lazarus, who was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed. For hauing ſaid: <hi>Lord if thou hadst bene heere, my brother had not bene dead,</hi> ſhe preſently added: <hi>But I know, that euen now whatſoeuer thou wilt aske of God,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:173416:88"/>
God will giue it thee.</hi> Which ſpeach ſhe could neuer haue vſed in any good ſenſe, if ſhe had not learned this doctrine of the Sinagogue, who offered ſacrifices, almes, and prayers for the departed, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les ſhe had knowen and belieued, that the dead might be holpen by the piety of the liuing; as Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Allen learnedly concludeth, in his Treatiſe of Purgatory.</p>
               <p>Actes 2.14. <hi>Whom God hath raiſed vp, looſing the ſorrowes of hell.</hi> In which wordes two things are to be noted which clearly make for the proofe of Purgatory. The one, that in this place where Chriſt was, there were certaine ſorrowes and paines. The other, that ſome there were inflicted for ſinne v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon whome he beſtowed that gratious benefit, as to diſcharge
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:173416:89" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and looſe them of thoſe paines. For as the Rhemes Teſtament very well noteth, Chriſt was not in paines himſelfe, but looſed other men of their paines.</p>

                  <hi>XLVIII.</hi> That it is not lawfull to make, or haue Images.</head>
               <p>COntrary to the expreſſe words of their owne Bible, Exod. 25.18. <hi>And thou ſhalt make two Cherubims of gold, of beaten worke ſhalt thou make them, in the two endes of the Mercy ſeate.</hi> Theſe grauen Angells, were Images of the higheſt order of Angells (one excepted) which is in heauen, and were made with faces of beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full young men, and commanded to be ſet vp by God himſelfe in the Holy of Holyes: which <hi>S. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> witneſſeth the Iewes to haue worſhipped, epiſt. ad Marcellam. Therefore it is lawfull to make Images.</p>
               <p>1. Kings 6.35. <hi>And he carued
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:173416:91" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thereon Cherubims, and Palme-trees, and open Flowers, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered them with gold, fitted vpon the carued worke.</hi> Hence is to be gathered, that the precept of not making <hi>grauen Idolls,</hi> doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all concerne <hi>Images,</hi> that is to ſay, the true repreſentation of thinges meerly imaginary and not ſubſiſting, for as <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſayth 1. Cor. 8. <hi>An Idoll is nothing.</hi> So that the Idoll repreſenteth that which is not, the Image that which is (a moſt remarkable difference.)</p>
               <p>Agayne, ſeeing an Idol is that properly, which being nothing (as <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſayth) is repreſented to be ſomething, or that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents the thing that is not; if our Reformers belieue the Images of Chriſt crucified to be an Idoll, they then belieue, that Chriſt was
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:173416:92" rendition="simple:additions"/>
neuer crucifyed: for ſo it would follow neceſſarily, that the Image of Chriſt crucifyed, being an Idoll, therfore chriſt was neuer crucified.</p>
               <p>Heb. 9.1.5. <hi>Then verily, the firſt Couenant, had alſo ordinances of diuine ſeruice, and a worldly ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary &amp;c. and ouer it, the Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims of glory, ſhadowing the mercy-ſeate.</hi> Loe <hi>S. Paul</hi> calleth the images of the Cherubims which Salomon made, an <hi>ordinance of diuine ſeruice,</hi> which our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers call, the making of Idols: whome ſhall we ſooner belieue, Bleſſed <hi>S. Paul,</hi> or a Reformed Brother?</p>
               <p>To conclude, an Image, is of ſuch diuine and naturall right, that all vnderſtanding, imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſenſe, as well interiour, as exteriour, is made by way of
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:173416:92" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Images, called <hi>ſpecies ſenſibiles,</hi> &amp; <hi>inſenſibiles.</hi> The body cannot be in light, without its ſhadow: the Moone, and the Starres imprint their image in the water: a man cannot looke in a glaſſe, without making his Image; Therefore, eyther God, and Nature it ſelfe, doth breake this commandement as well as we, or elſe it is abſurd to ſay, that we do breake it, in making of Images.</p>

                  <hi>LIIII.</hi> That the publique ſeruice of the Church, ought not to be ſaid, but in a language that all the people may vnderstand.</head>
               <p>COntrary to the expreſſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of their owne Bible, Luc. 1.8. <hi>And it came to paſſe, that while he executed the Priests of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, before God, in the order of his courſe, according to the custome of the Prieſts office, his lot was to burne Incenſe in the Temple of the Lord; and the whole multitude of people were praying without, at the time of Incenſe.</hi> Where it is to be noted. 1. That this was then the common cuſtome. 2. All the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:173416:103"/>
were without, and the Prieſt within; how then did they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand him? Therfore the publique ſeruice of the Church may be ſo ſaid, as all the people vnderſtand it not.</p>
               <p>Leuit. 16.17. <hi>And there ſhalbe no man in the Tabernacle of the congregation, when he goeth in to make an attonement in the holy place, vntill he come out, &amp; haue made an attonement for himſelfe, and for his houſehould, and for all the Congregation of Iſrael.</hi> Therefore &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I ſhal not need to produce the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities of Fathers for this point, when the as practiſe of the whole Chriſtian world, for theſe many hundred yeares together hath byn directly contrary to our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers heerin, againſt which to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:173416:103"/>
(as S. Aug ſayth) were inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent madnes. See to <hi>Rhe. Test. pag.</hi> 46. But againſt this they will obiect out of Scripture this their probableſt place, 1. Cor. 14.16. <hi>When thou ſhalt bleſſe with the ſpirit, how ſhall he that occupyeth the roome of the vnlearned, ſay Amen, at thy giuing of thankes, ſeeing he vnderſtandeth not what thou ſayeſt? For thou verily giueſt thankes, but the other is not edifyed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Heer to I anſwere, that there be two kindes of prayer, or giuing of thankes in the Church. The one <hi>Priuate,</hi> which euery man ſayes by himſelfe alone. The other <hi>Publique,</hi> which the Prieſt ſayth, in the name and perſon of the whole Church. As concerning <hi>priuate</hi> prayer, no Catholique denies, but it is very expedient, that euery man
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:173416:104"/>
pray in his owne tongue, to the end he may vnderſtand what he ſayes. But for the <hi>Publike</hi> praiers of the Church it is not neceſſary that the common people vnderſtand them, becauſe it is not they who pray, but the Prieſt in the name of the whole Church. For as it was inough for the people of the old Law to know and vnderſtand, that in ſuch a Sacrifice conſiſted the worſhip of God, although they had not ſo cleare an vnderſtanding of euery thing that was done therein (as hath bene ſaid:) euen ſo in the new Law, when the people aſſiſt at the ſacrifice of the Maſſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging thereby that God is worſhipped, and that it is inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the remembra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Chriſts death and paſſion, although they vnderſtand not the Latin tongue,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:173416:104"/>
yet are they not deſtitute of the vtiltty and fruit therof; beſides the help of the Godly Ceremonies therein, which do inſtruct them in the whole.</p>
               <p>And indeed this place by them alledged ſerueth nothing to the purpoſe, but rather agaynſt them, ſeeing it proues, that the common ſeruice of the Church, was not then in a tongue which euery man vnderſtood, but in another lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, which was not ſo common vnto all. For S. Paul ſaying, <hi>How ſhall he that occupieth the roome of the vnlearned, ſay, Amen, at the giuing of thanks, ſeeing be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth not what thou ſayest,</hi> ſhewes, that ſuch giuing of than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, was not accuſtomed to be made in the vulgar, tongue; and requires, or rather ſuppoſes, that
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:173416:105"/>
in the ſeruice of the church, there ſhould be ſome other to ſupply the place of the vnlearned, that is, one that ſhould haue further vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of that tongue, in which the ſeruice of the Church is ſaid. But had the Seruice bene in the vulgar tongue, there needed no man, to haue ſupplied the place of the Idior, that vnderſtandeth not. So that, <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſhewes moſt clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that ſuch ſeruice was not exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in a vulgar tongue, but in another which was not common to the whole people (ſuch as the Latin tongue is now in England, as alſo throughout the whole Eaſt) and yet was not in the contra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry extreme, that is to ſay, wholy ſtrange, or vtterly barbarous.</p>
               <p>And ſeeing our Aduerſaires haue this place continually in their
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:173416:105"/>
mouthes, and thereby deceyue the ſimple people, I would haue them to know that this text of <hi>S. Paul,</hi> is greatly peruerted by the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers themſelues. For whereas the Greeke and Latin text hath, <hi>He who ſupplies the place of an Idiot, how ſhall he ſay, Amen?</hi> the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of <hi>Geneua,</hi> in many of their Bibles, haue turned the ſame moſt deceitfully and maliciouſly, thus: <hi>He that is an idiot, how ſhall he ſay Amen?</hi> As if there were no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betwixt an Idiot, &amp; he who ſupplyes the place of an Idiot?</p>
               <p>Moreouer, the thankeſgiuing to which <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſayth <hi>Amen</hi> ſhould be anſwered, is not at all practiſed in many of our Reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, where neyther Idiots, nor thoſe that ſupply the place of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diots, do anſwere <hi>Amen</hi> as <hi>S. Paul</hi>
                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:173416:106"/>
willeth; ſeeing they haue altered <hi>Amen,</hi> into <hi>So be it,</hi> which is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repugnant to his meaning, as alſo to the practice of the whole Church. For they can not ſay for their excuſe, that <hi>S. Paul</hi> wrote to thoſe, who ſpake in the Hebrue tongue (for <hi>Amen</hi> is Hebrue) ſince he wrote to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> who had their publike ſeruice in Greek, and not in Hebrue: A mayne ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that the word <hi>Amen,</hi> ought to be retayned in all lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, as it hitherto hath euer been amongſt all Chriſtians, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the dayes of our Reformers; in ſo much that the moſt learned <hi>S. Auguſtin</hi> writeth, that it is not lawfull to turne <hi>Amen,</hi> into any other vulgar language, without the ſcandall of the whole Church. Aug. epiſt. 118. &amp; 2. de Doct. c. 20.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="209" facs="tcp:173416:106"/>To conclude, I cannot but much meruaile at the ſimplicity of the common people, who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the great light of their reformed Ghoſpell, ſee not the looſeneſſe and vanity of this their Leaders cauill. For, neyther the mayſters, or ſchollers, are ſo ſenſeleſſe, I hope, as to ſay that their own ſeruice, conſiſting part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Pſalmes of <hi>Dauid</hi> (the hardeſt part of all the Bible) and partly of leſſons taken out of the old and new Teſtament, is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of all the people preſent thereat; ſince the greateſt Diuines that euer were, durſt neuer ſay ſo much of themſelues. How wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully then, do they wrangle with vs about this matter? But perhaps they will ſay, that thogh the ſimple people vnderſtand not the hard
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:173416:107"/>
places contayned in the pſalmes and Seruice, yet (to their great comfort) they vnderſtand at leaſt ſome part thereof: euen ſo ſay we of our Maſſe, and of our ſimple people who aſſiſt therat: And ſo conclude as I began in the title of this Booke, <hi>By thyne owne mouth I iudge thee, naughty ſeruant.</hi>
