            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head type="sub">For the Satisfaction of thoſe that are Adventurers, and
enclined to be ſo.</head>
            <p>IT has, I know, been much expected from me, that I
ſhould give ſome farther Narrative of thoſe parts of
<hi>America,</hi> where I am chiefly intereſted, and have
lately been; having continued there above a Year
after my <hi>former Relation,</hi> and receiving ſince my
return, the freſheſt and fulleſt Advices of its <hi>Progreſs</hi>
and <hi>Improvement.</hi> But as the reaſon of my coming back, was a
<hi>Difference</hi> between the <hi>Lord Baltamore</hi> and my ſelf, about the
<hi>Lands of Delaware,</hi> in conſequence, reputed of mighty mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to us, ſo I wav'd publiſhing any thing that might look
in favour of the Country or inviting to it, whilſt it lay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Diſcouragement and Diſreputation of that Lord's claim
and pretences.</p>
            <p>But ſince they are, after many fair and full hearings before
the <hi>Lords</hi> of the <hi>Committee</hi> for <hi>Plantations</hi> juſtly and happily
<hi>Diſmiſt,</hi> and the things agreed; and that the <hi>Letters</hi>
which daily preſs me from all Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s, on the ſubject of <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:96945:2"/>
are ſo many and voluminous, that to anſwer them ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally,
were a Task too heavy, and repeated to perform, I
have thought it moſt eaſie to the Enquirer, as well as my ſelf,
to make this Account <hi>Publick,</hi> leſt my ſilence, or a more pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
intimation of things, ſhould diſoblige the juſt inclinations
of any to <hi>America,</hi> and at a time too, when an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Providence ſeems to favour its Plantation, and open a
Door to <hi>Europeans</hi> to paſs thither. That then which is my
part to do in this Advertiſement is,</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>To Relate our Progreſs, eſpecially ſince my laſt of the
Month called</hi> Auguſt 83.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Capacity of the Place for farther Improvement,
in order to Trade and Commerce.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>Which Way thoſe that are Adventurers; or incline to be
ſo, may imploy their Money to a fair and ſecure Profit;</hi> ſuch as
ſhall equally encourage Poor and Rich, which cannot fail of Advancing the Country in conſequence.</p>
            <p>I. We have had about NINETY SAYL <hi>of Ships with</hi>
PASSENGERS ſince the beginning of 82. and not one
Veſſel, deſigned to the <hi>Province,</hi> through Gods mercy, hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
miſcarried.</p>
            <p>The Eſtimate of the People may be thus made; <hi>Eighty</hi>
to each Ship, which comes to SEVEN THOUSAND
TWO-HUNDRED PERSONS: At leaſt a <hi>Thouſand</hi>
there before, with ſuch as from other Places in our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood
are ſince come to reſide among us: And I preſume
the <hi>Births</hi> at leaſt equal to the <hi>Burials:</hi> For having made
our firſt Settlement high in the <hi>Freſhes</hi> of the Rivers, we do
not finde our ſelves ſubject to thoſe Seaſonings that affect
ſome other Countries upon the ſame Coaſt.</p>
            <p>The People are a <hi>Collection</hi> of divers Nations in <hi>Europe:</hi> As,
<hi>French, Dutch, Germans, Sweeds, Danes, Finns, Scotch' Iriſh,</hi> and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96945:2"/>
               <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and of the laſt equal to all the reſt: And which is
admirable, not a Reflection on that Account: But as they
are of one kind, and in one Place, and under One Allegiance,
ſo they live like People of <hi>One County;</hi> which Civil Union has
had a conſiderable influence towards the proſperity of that
Place.</p>
            <p>II. <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> and our intended Metropolis, as I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
Writ, is two Miles long, and a Mile broad, and at each
end it lies <hi>thot</hi> mile, <hi>upon a Navigable River.</hi> The ſcituation
<hi>high</hi> and <hi>dry,</hi> yet repleniſhed with <hi>running ſtreams.</hi> Beſides the
High-Street, that runs in the midle from River to River,
and is an <hi>hundred foot</hi> broad, it has Eight Streets more that
run the ſame courſe, the leaſt of which is <hi>fifty foot</hi> in breath.
And beſides Broad-Street, which croſſeth the Town in the
middle, and is alſo an hundred foot wide, there are twenty
ſtreets more, that run the ſame courſe, and are alſo fifty foot
broad. The names of thoſe Streets are moſtly taken from
the things that Spontaneouſly grow in the Country, <hi>As Vine-Street,
Mulbery-Street, Cheſnut-Srteet, Wallnut-Street, Strawbery-Street,
Cranbery-Street, Plumb-Street, Hickery-Street, Pine-Street,
Oake-Street, Beach-Street, Aſh-Street, Popler-Street, Saſſafrax-Street,
and the like.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>III. I mentioned in my laſt Account, that from my Arival
in <hi>Eighty two,</hi> to the Date thereof, being ten Moneths, we had
got up <hi>Four-ſcore</hi> Houſes at our Town, and that ſome Villages
were ſetled about it. From that time to my coming away,
which was a Year within a few Weeks, the Town advanced
to <hi>Three hundred and fifty ſeven Houſes;</hi> divers of them, large,
well built, with good Cellars, three ſtories, and ſome with
<hi>Belconies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IV. There is alſo a fair <hi>Key</hi> of about three hundred foot
ſquare, Built by <hi>Samuel Carpenter,</hi> to which a Ship of <hi>five
hundred Tuns</hi> may lay her broade ſide: and others intend to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96945:3"/>
follow his example. We have alſo a Rope-walk made by
<hi>B. Wilcox,</hi> and cordage for ſhipping already ſpun at it.</p>
            <p>V. There inhabits moſt ſorts of uſeful Trades-men, As
<hi>Carpenters, Joyners, Bricklayers, Maſons, Plaſterers, Plumers,
Smiths, Glaſiers, Taylers, Shoemakers, Butchers, Bakers, Brewers,
Glovers, Tanners, Felmongers, Wheelrights, Millrights, Shiprights,
Boatrights, Ropemakers, Saylmakers Blockmakers, Turners</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>VI. There are <hi>Two Markets</hi> every Week and <hi>Two Fairs</hi>
every Year. In other places Markets alſo, as at <hi>Cheſter</hi> and
<hi>New-Caſtle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VII. Seven <hi>Ordinaries</hi> for the Intertainment of <hi>Strangers</hi>
and <hi>Work-Men,</hi> that are not Houſe-keepers, and a good Meal
to be had for ſixpence, ſterl.</p>
            <p>VIII. The hours for Work and Meals to <hi>Labourers,</hi> are
fixt, and known by Ring of <hi>Bell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IX. After nine at Night, the <hi>Officers</hi> go the Rounds and
no Perſon, without very good cauſe, ſuffered to be at any
Publick-Houſe that is not a Lodger.</p>
            <p>X. Tho this <hi>Town</hi> ſeemed at firſt, contrived for the
Purchaſers of the <hi>firſt hundred ſhares,</hi> each ſhare conſiſting of
5000 <hi>Acres,</hi> yet few going, and that their abſence might not
Check the Improvement of the Place, and <hi>Strangers,</hi> that flockt
to us, be thereby Excluded, I added that half of the Town,
which lies on the <hi>Skulkill,</hi> that we might have Room for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
and after Commers, that were not of that number, and it
hath already had great ſucceſs to the Improvement of the
Place.</p>
            <p>XI. Some <hi>Veſſels</hi> have been here Built, and many <hi>Boats;</hi>
and by that means, a ready Conveniency for Paſſage of People
and Goods.</p>
            <p>XII. Divers <hi>Brickerys</hi> going on, many Cellars already
Ston'd or Brick'd, and ſome Brick Houſes going up.</p>
            <p>XIII. The <hi>Town</hi> is well furniſh'd with convenient <hi>Mills;</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:96945:3"/>
and what with their <hi>Garden Plats,</hi> (the leaſt half an Acre) the
<hi>Fiſh</hi> of the River, and their labour, to the <hi>Country-man,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to pay with the proviſions of his own growth, they live
Comfortably.</p>
            <p>XIV. The Improvement of the place is beſt meaſur'd, by
the <hi>advance</hi> of Value upon every mans Lot. I will venture
to ſay, that the worſt Lot in the Town, without any Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon it, is worth <hi>four times</hi> more then it was when it
was lay'd out, and the beſt <hi>forty.</hi> And though it ſeems un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal
that the Abſent ſhould be thus benefited by the Improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of thoſe that are upon the place, eſpecially, when they
have ſerv'd no Office, run no hazard, nor as yet defray'd any
Publick charge, yet this advantage does certainly redound to
them, and whoever they are, they are great Debtors to the
Country; of which I ſhall now ſpeak more at large.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Of Country Settlements.</head>
               <p>1. WE do ſettle in the way of <hi>Townſhips</hi> or <hi>Villages,</hi>
each of which contains 5000 Acres in ſquare and
at leaſt <hi>Ten Families:</hi> The regulation of the Country, being a
Family to each five hundred Acres: Some Townſhips have
more, where the Intereſt of the People is leſs then that quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity;
which often falls out.</p>
               <p>2. Many that had right to more Land, were at firſt cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
to have their <hi>whole</hi> quantity, without regard to this way
of ſettlement, tho by ſuch <hi>Wilderneſs</hi> vacancies they had ruin'd
the Country, and their own intereſt of courſe. I had in my
view, <hi>Society, Aſſiſtance, Eaſy Commerce, Inſtruction of Youth,
Goverment of Peoples manners, Conveniency of Religious Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,
Encouragement of Mechanicks, diſtinct and beaten Roads,</hi>
and it has anſwer'd in all thoſe reſpects, <hi>I</hi> think, to an
Univerſall Content.</p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:96945:4"/>
               <p>3. Our <hi>Townſhips</hi> lie ſquare: generally the Village in the
Center; the Houſes either oppoſit, or elſe oppoſit to the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
betwixt two houſes over the way, for nearer neighborhood.
We have another Method, that tho the Village be in the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
yet after a different manner: Five hundred Acres are allotted
for the Village, which among ten families comes to fifty Acres
each: This lies ſquare, and on the outſide of the ſquare ſtand
the Houſes, with their fifty Acres running back, whoſe ends
meeting, make the Center of the 500. Acres, as they are to
the whole. Before the Doors of thoſe Houſes, lies the high
way, and croſs it, every mans 450 Acres of Land, that makes
up his Complement of 500 ſo that the Conveniency of Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood
is made agreeable with that of the Land.</p>
               <p>4. I ſaid nothing in my laſt of any number of Townſhips,
but there were at leaſt <hi>FIFTY</hi> ſettled before my leaving
thoſe parts, which was in the moneth call'd <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1684.</p>
               <p>5. I viſitted many of them, and found them much advanc'd
in their Improvements. <hi>Houſes</hi> over their heads, and <hi>Garden-Plots,
Coverts</hi> for their Cattle, an <hi>encreaſe</hi> of ſtock, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Encloſures in Corn, eſpecially, the firſt Commers; and I
may ſay of ſome Poor men, even to the beginings of an Eſtate:
The difference of labouring for themſelves and for others; of
an Inheritance, and a Rack Leaſe, <hi>being never better underſtood.</hi>

               <head>Of The Produce of the Earth.</head>
               <p>1. THe <hi>EARTH,</hi> by Gods bleſſing, has more then
anſwer'd our expectation; the pooreſt places in
our Judgment, producing large Crops of Garden Stuff, and
Grain. And though our Ground has not generally the ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms
of the fat Necks, that lie upon ſalt Waters in Provinces
ſouthern of us, our Grain is thought to <hi>excell</hi> and our Crops to

               <p>6. Engliſh <hi>GRASS-SEED takes well;</hi> which will give us
fatting Hay in time. Of this <hi>I</hi> made an Experiment in my
own Court Yard, upon ſand, that was dug out of my Cellar,
with ſeed that had layn in a <hi>Cask,</hi> open to the weather two
Winters and a Summer: I caus'd it to be ſown in the beginning
of the month called <hi>April,</hi> and a fortnight before <hi>Midſummer</hi>
it was fit to <hi>Mow:</hi> It grew very thick: But I ordered it to be
fed, being in the nature of a Graſs Plott, on purpoſe to ſee if
the Roots lay firm: And though it had been meer ſand,
caſt out of the Cellar, but a Year before, the ſeed took ſuch
Root, and held the earth ſo faſt, and faſtened it ſelf ſo well
in the Earth, that it held and fed like old Engliſh Ground.
I mention this, to confute the Objections that lie againſt thoſe
Parts, as if that, firſt, Engliſh Graſs would not grow; next,
not enough to mow; and laſtly, not firm enough to feed, from
the Levity of the Mould.</p>

mighty well</hi> for the time: The <hi>Peach</hi> Excellent, on ſtanders,
and in great quantities: They ſun-dry them, and lay them
up in lofts, as we do roots here, and ſtew them with Meat
in Winter time. <hi>Muſmellons</hi> and <hi>Water Mellons</hi> are raiſed there,
with as little care as Pumpkins in <hi>England.</hi> The <hi>VINE</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,

many more, that the Earth is very fertil, and the Lord hath done his part,

eat of. A brave <hi>Orchard</hi> and <hi>Nurſery</hi> have I planted, and thrive mightily,

which way they may lay out their Money to beſt
advantage, ſo as it may yeild them fair returns, and with
content to all concerned, which is the laſt part of my preſent

perhaps given ſome occaſion to ignorance and prejudice to
run without mercy, meaſure or diſtinction againſt <hi>America,</hi> of
which <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> to be ſure has had its ſhare.</p>
               <p>1. It is agreed on all hands, that the <hi>Poor</hi> are the <hi>Hands</hi> and
<hi>Feet</hi> of the Rich. It is their labour that improves Countries;
and to encourage them, is to promote the real benefit of the
publick. Now as there are abundance of theſe people in many
parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> extreamly deſirous of going to <hi>America;</hi> ſo
the way of helping them thither, or when there, and the return

and Families, but have nothing to begin with there;
and thoſe that want ſo much as to tranſport themſelves and
Families thither.</p>
               <p>3. The firſt of theſe may be entertained in this manner.
Say I have 5000 Acres, I will ſettle <hi>Ten Families</hi> upon them,
in way of Village, and build each an houſe, an out-houſe for

<hi>Horſe, Bull</hi> and <hi>Boar;</hi> I find them with Tools, and give
each their firſt Ground-ſeed. They ſhall continue <hi>Seven</hi>
Year, or more, as we agree, at <hi>half encreaſe,</hi> being bound to

and <hi>improved</hi> to corn and graſs; the charge will come to about
<hi>ſixty</hi> pounds Engliſh for each Family: At the ſeven years end,
the Improvement will be worth, as things go now, 120 l. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the value of the <hi>encreaſe</hi> of the Stock, which may be
neer as much more, allowing for caſualties; eſpecially, if the
People are honeſt and careful, or a man be upon the ſpot him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
or have an Overſeer ſometimes to inſpect them. The charge
in the whole is 832 l. And the value of ſtock and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
2400 l. I think I have been modeſt in my computation.
Theſe <hi>Farms</hi> are afterwards fit for <hi>Leaſes</hi> at <hi>full</hi> rent, or how elſe
the Owner ſhall pleaſe to diſpoſe of them. Alſo the People
will by this time be skilled in the Country, and well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
to ſettle themſelves with ſtock upon their own Land.</p>
               <p>4. The other ſort of <hi>poor people</hi> may be very beneficially
tranſported upon theſe terms: Say I have 5000 <hi>Acres</hi> I ſhould
ſettle as before, I will give to each Family 100 <hi>Acres,</hi> which in
the whole makes 1000; and to each Family <hi>thirty pounds</hi>
Engliſh, half in hand, and half there, which in the whole comes
to 300 l. After four years are expired, in which time they may
be eaſie, and in a good condition, they ſhall each of them pay
<hi>five pounds, and ſo yearly for ever, as a Fee-farm rent;</hi> which in
the whole comes to 50 l. a Year. Thus a man that buys 5000.
<hi>Acres</hi> may ſecure and ſettle his 4000 by the gift of one, and in
a way that hazard and intereſt allowed for, amounts to at leaſt
ten <hi>per cent.</hi> upon Land ſecurity, beſides the value it puts upon
the reſt of the 5000 <hi>Acres.</hi> I propoſe that there be at leaſt <hi>two
working hands</hi> beſides the <hi>wife,</hi> whether ſon or ſervant; and
that they oblige what they carry; and for further ſecurity
bind themſelves as ſervants for ſome time, that they will
ſettle the ſaid land accordingly, and when they are once ſeated,
their inprovements <hi>ſecurity</hi> enough for the Rent.</p>
               <p>5. There is yet another expedient, and that is, give to <hi>ten
Families 1000 Acres</hi> forever, at a <hi>ſmall acknowledgement,</hi> and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:96945:9"/>
ſettle them in way of Village, as afore; by their ſeating thus,
the Land taken up is ſecured from others, becauſe the <hi>method</hi>
of the Country is anſwered, and the value ſuch a ſettlement
gives to the reſt reſerved, is not inconſiderable; I mean, the
40<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> Acres; eſpecially that which is <hi>Contiguous:</hi> For their
<hi>Children</hi> when grown up, and Handicrafts will ſoon cover to
fix next them, and ſuch after ſettlements to begin at an
<hi>Improved Rent in Fee, or for long Leaſes or ſmall Acknowledgements,
and good Improvements,</hi> muſt advance the whole conſiderably.
I conceive any of theſe methods to iſſue in a ſufficient advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to Adventurers, and they all give good encouragement
to feeble and poor Families.</p>
               <p>6. That which is moſt adviſeable for People, intended thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to carry with them, is in ſhort, all things relating to
<hi>Apparel, Building, Housholdſtuf, Husbandry, Fowling,</hi> and
<hi>Fishing.</hi> Some <hi>Spice, Spirits</hi> and <hi>double <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

amiſs: But I adviſe all to proportion their Eſtates thus; one
third in <hi>Money,</hi> and two thirds in <hi>Goods.</hi> Upon <hi>peices of eight,</hi>
there will be almoſt a third gotten, for they go at 6 s. and by
goods well bought, at leaſt <hi>fifty</hi> pounds ſterl. for every hundred
pounds; ſo that a man worth 400 l. here, is worth 600 l. there,
without ſweating.</p>

               <p>1. THO Ships go hence at all times of the Year, it muſt
be acknowledged, that to go ſo as to arrive at <hi>Spring</hi>
or <hi>Fall,</hi> is beſt. For the Summer may be of the hotteſt, for
freſh Commers; and in the Winter, the wind that prevails, is
the North Weſt, and that blows off the Coaſt, ſo that ſometimes
it is difficult to enter the <hi>Capes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. I propoſe therefore, that Ships go hence about the middle
of the moneths call'd <hi>February</hi> and <hi>Auguſt,</hi> which, allowing
two moneths for paſſage, reaches time enough to plant in
the <hi>Spring</hi> ſuch things as are carried hence to plant, and in the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:96945:10"/>
                  <hi>Fall</hi> to get a ſmall Cottage, and clear ſome Land againſt the
next <hi>Spring.</hi> I have made a diſcovery of about a hundred
Miles Weſt, and find thoſe back Lands richer in Soyl, Woods
and Fountains, then that by <hi>Delaware;</hi> eſpecially upon the
<hi>SASQVEHANAH River.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. I muſt confeſs I prefer the <hi>Fall</hi> to come thither, as belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
it is more healthy to be followed with Winter then Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;
tho, through the <hi>great goodneſs and mercy of God,</hi> we
have had an extrordinary portion of health, for ſo new and
numerous a Colony, notwithſtanding we have not been ſo
regular in time.</p>
               <p>4. The <hi>Paſſage</hi> is not to be ſet by any man; for Ships will
be quicker and ſlower. Some have been <hi>four</hi> moneths, and
ſome but <hi>one,</hi> and as often. Generally between <hi>ſix and nine
weeks.</hi> One year, of four and twenty Sayl, I think, there was
not three above nine, and there was one or two under ſix
weeks in paſſage.</p>
               <p>5. To render it more healthy, it is good to keep as much
upon <hi>Deck</hi> as may be; for the <hi>Air</hi> helps againſt the offenſive
ſmells of a <hi>Crowd,</hi> and a <hi>cloſe place.</hi> Alſo to <hi>ſcrape</hi> often the
Cabbins, under the Beds; and either carry ſtore of <hi>Rue</hi> and

Adding, that I would for that reaſon never return: I
think fit to ſay, That <hi>Next Summer,</hi> God willing, I intend to
go back, and carry my Family, and the beſt part of my Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Eſtate with me. And this I do, not only of Duty, but
Inclination and Choice. God will Bleſs and Proſper poor

ſuch as are willing to embrace any of the foregoing propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
for the <hi>Improvement of Adventurers Eſtates,</hi> may not be
diſcouraged, from an inability to find ſuch <hi>Land-Lords, Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,

few of any quality or capacity, deſigned to the <hi>Province,</hi> that
do not inform him of their inclinations and condition.</p>
               <p>Now for you that think of going thither, I have this to ſay,
by way of caution; if an <hi>hair</hi> of our heads falls not to the
ground, without the providence of God, Remember, <hi>your
removal</hi> is of greater moment. Wherefore have a due reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
and regard to his good Providence, as becomes a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

and of all others. Be moderate in Expectation, count on La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
before a Crop, and Coſt before Gain, for ſuch perſons will
