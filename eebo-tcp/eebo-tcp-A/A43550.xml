         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of the great Victory obtained by

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">U</seg>Pon the 18 of Ianuary being Wednes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
His Majesties forces in <hi>Cornwall</hi>
drew out of <hi>Bodmin</hi> with a resolution
to fall upon the enemy in <hi>Lescand.</hi>
That night they lay abroad in <hi>Bocon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocke</hi>
parke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the next morning as they
were advancing towards the Towne,
the enemy leaving that advantage,
which the dangerous and difficult avenues unto the place
through deepe and narrow lanes did give them, came forth
into the field. They were about 20 foot Colours, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
4 and 500 horse. They faced us at <hi>Hilsborough,</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
being planted upon a little hill encompased with a
Bogge. There were but two passages (and those but wide
enough to receive ten or twelve men in breast) over it.
His Majesties Army tooke no feare for all that, their joy
to see their enemy, above either their expectation or their
hope fairely in the field, drowning all apprehensions of
that disadvantage, wherefore after prayers upon the
place (which the Rebels, as was afterwards confessed by
the prisoners, scoffingly termed masse) we advanced bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
forwards. Ere wee came neare them, they gave us two or
three volees in vaine, hurt none of us: but so soone as we
were got within distance of them, and had saluted them
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:34916:3"/>
with one volee, they turned about and fled, Our soldiers
were eager to pursue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. but by the industrie of their
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunders, were kept still in good order. This providence
diverted a mischeife from us, which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as it seemes, the enemie
had intended us. For on a  suddaine the whole body of their
horse turn'd backe upon us. But finding us in our rankes,
and unbroken, they utterly lost their courage, and ran away,
as if some tempest had driven them, even over their owne
men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The soldiers br<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ke now forth with all violence into
the chase (they could not any longer be possibly withheld)
we followed it at least five miles, even to the townes end.
There we were a litttle stayed by a volee, which a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the enemies, that had not that day marched forth, gave
us from their barricadoes. It did noe hurt; onely shot a horse
of Captaine <hi>Digbies</hi> through the legg. The volee ended,
they all ran presently away; and we enterd the Towne. Wee
found there good store of Ammunition, and five excellent
brasse gunnes, and one iron. This day there were slaine in
the pursuit 200 of the Rebells and 700 we tooke prisoners;
among them Sir <hi>Shilston Colmadee;</hi> and 8 colours; and all
this with the losse but of one common souldier, what became
of the rest of their colours we know not, but for certaine
they brought backe onely one into the Towne. The next
day, which was Friday, we rested there. On Saturday wee
advanced yet farther Eastward. In the meane while a fresh
regiment of the Earle of <hi>Stamford</hi> under the command of
Lieutenant Colonell <hi>Colmadee</hi> had entred Launcestan; but
upon our approach that way fled thence to Plymouth. This
evening the one halfe of our Army was quartered about
<hi>Calstecke</hi> and <hi>Cutteale;</hi> the other marched with Sir <hi>Ralph
Hopton</hi> towards <hi>Saltash,</hi> where the enemy had rallyed and
made head against us.</p>
            <p>On the morrow about 4 in the evening Sir <hi>Ralph</hi> assaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Towne. <hi>Ruthen, Crocher, Strode, Pyne,</hi> and divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of the enemies Chiefes were there. and they had 10
peeces of ordinance with them. 3 howres they held out; but
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:34916:3"/>
at last we forced the place (lost but one man in this service)
seized on their artillery, and so dispers'd the very men them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
that they could have but little time, lesse opportunity
to escape. yet it being darke, wee could not for the present
know either how many of them, or whom we had taken. the
morning was likely to yeild some better account of them,
but this Relator was dispatch'd for <hi>Oxford</hi> before it was day.
Ere he came away, one boate full of them putting over for
<hi>Plymmouth,</hi> suncke in the passage. perhaps there were of
their Chiefes in that. As he passed <hi>Devon,</hi> he heard it every
where, it was almost every mans discourse, how that <hi>Ruthen</hi>
himselfe and <hi>Stroud</hi> and the rest had miscarried in the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
Neither of these successes did the Kings Commanders
attribute to their owne strength or policy. they gave the
glory to him, whose worke alone it was, causing a Chaplaine
of the Army to draw a forme of thankes-giving, to goe
throughout <hi>Cornwall</hi> for those great deliverances.</p>
            <p>Since this Relaters arrivall at <hi>Oxford,</hi> His Majestie hath
received a more full information of Sir <hi>Ralph Hoptons</hi> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
at <hi>Saltash</hi> where hee hath taken (besides those 10 pei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of ordinance allready mentioned) 700 prisoners more,
and armes for 4000 men, and a shippe with 16 peeces of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
in it, formerly brought up to batter the Towne. It
pleasing God, contrary to their expectation, to give it up a
prey to that power, which it came thither to suppresse.</p>

Gunners; two thousand Armes, one thousand Prisoners,
and the Towne Plundered, which their owne base be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
was the cause of; for after we entred the Town
they shot out of their windowes at us, and killed
one of our men: what favour such desperate Rebels
deserve, let all the world judge.</p>
