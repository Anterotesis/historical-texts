            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CASE OF THE MARRINERS Which ſerved the Eaſt-India Company IN THEIR <hi>Wars in the</hi> EAST-INDIES. AND Of the Widows and Orphans of thoſe that Periſhed in the ſaid Wars, to the Number of Five hundred, and as many Widows.</head>
            <head type="sub">
               <hi>Humbly Preſented to the Honourable Houſe of Commons.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company, in the Years 1683, 1684, 1685 and 1686. entered the ſaid Marriners on Board ſeveral of their Ships, to make direct Voyages to and from the <hi>Eaſt-Indies, viz.</hi> in the Ships called <hi>The</hi> Charles <hi>the Second,</hi> the <hi>Beaufort,</hi> the <hi>Ceſar,</hi> the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,</hi> &amp;c. and the ſaid Marriners were ſo taken on Board in a Merchant-like way, and at low Wages, there being then no Wars betwixt this Crown and any Prince or State in the World, nor did theſe Marriners know of any War in <hi>India,</hi> nor did they any way apprehend any ſuch thing was to be, when they proceeded in the ſaid Voyages.</p>
            <p>That in ſome ſhort time after their Arrival in the <hi>Indies,</hi> the Companies Agents there, ingaged the ſaid Ships in an Actual War againſt the <hi>Great Mogul</hi> and others, and by exceſſive Tortures and Puniſhment, compelled the ſaid Marriners to ſerve in ſeveral places in their ſaid Wars, in ſeveral Parts there on Land very remote from any Shore: Yet the ſaid Agents found it abſolutely neceſſary, not only by Tortures, but alſo by many ſpecious Promiſes, for their Encouragement, they ſhould receive very great Largeſſes, more than their very low Wages (as by Law and in Juſtice they ought to have) and thereupon they were, by the ſaid Companies Commanders, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed one full Sixth part of all Prizes that ſhould be taken during the ſaid War; which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes were put into Writing, and publickly read in ſeveral of the ſaid Ships.</p>
            <p>That during the ſaid War, there was taken in Prizes to the value of 1500000 <hi>l.</hi> and upwards; proved in the Exchequer, upon a Bill brought by the Attorney General for the King's Tenths, ſo that the Sixth part belonging to the Ships Companies amounts to about 260000 <hi>l.</hi> and upwards.</p>
            <p>That the ſaid Marriners have applied themſelves from time to time to the ſaid Company, for the ſaid Summ, or what ſhould appear due to them, and were Addreſſing themſelves to this Honorable Houſe the laſt Seſſions for Relief therein, whereupon a worthy Member of this Honorable Houſe, and then Governor of the Company, promiſed the ſaid Marriners Satisfaction if they would forbear: Upon which Promiſe they reſted quiet, in ſure hopes the ſame Promiſe would be complied withall, which yet they have not done, but have moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſcionably offered ſuch a ſmall and inconſiderable Summ, as is not fit to be mentioned, which the ſaid injured Marriners have rejected, hoping, if they were entituled to ſuch a Summ, they are entituled to much more.</p>
            <p>And foraſmuch as this Honorable Houſe hath ordered the ſaid Company to bring in their Books, and a State of their Debts and Credits; the ſaid Oppreſſed Marriners do humbly Hope, this Honorable Houſe will take notice, that they may have Credit on the ſaid Companies Books for the ſaid Summ, in order they may have Satisfaction for the ſame; and the rather, becauſe in their Anſwer to the Attorney General's Bill, on the behalf of the King, they have ſet forth, that the ſaid Marriners were to have a Sixth part of all the ſaid Prizes. And further, for that the ſaid Prizes were converted to the uſe of the Company, and they have divided the ſame amongſt themſelves, and received the Benefit of the ſame.</p>
