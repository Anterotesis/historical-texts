            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>YOu have here before your Lordship an Appeal from
<hi>Clamour,</hi> &amp; <hi>Calumny,</hi> to your <hi>Honour,</hi> and <hi>Iustice:</hi> And
to whom, but to my <hi>Right Reverend Diocesan,</hi> should
I fly for <hi>Protection,</hi> and <hi>Relief;</hi> when <hi>Religion,</hi> and <hi>Good
Manners,</hi> (though brought in by <hi>Head and Shoulders)</hi> are
made the <hi>Question!</hi> I am Arraigned as a <hi>Stickler</hi> for <hi>Popery;</hi>
An <hi>Enemy</hi> to the Establish'd Church of <hi>England;</hi> a <hi>Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer</hi>
of the <hi>London-Clergy;</hi> and a Sower of <hi>Dissention</hi> among
his Majesties <hi>Subjects:</hi> All which <hi>Reproches</hi> I Valu'd as my
<hi>Glory,</hi> so long as I was <hi>Wounded</hi> for the <hi>Churches sake,</hi> and
by the <hi>Common,</hi> and <hi>Profess'd Enemies</hi> of the <hi>True Sons</hi> of
<hi>That Church,</hi> and of All <hi>Loyal Subjects.</hi> But, I must Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
it has given me some <hi>Trouble,</hi> as well as matter of
<hi>Admiration,</hi> to see so <hi>Unaccountable</hi> a <hi>Change</hi> of <hi>Humour,</hi> now
of <hi>Late,</hi> from what it was <hi>some Few Years agon:</hi> And that the
<hi>Same Zeal,</hi> under the <hi>Same Method</hi> of <hi>Manage,</hi> and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection;</hi>
and for the very <hi>Same Cause</hi> too; Nay, and the
<hi>Self-same Publique Offices,</hi> and <hi>Applications,</hi> that were <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd,</hi>
and <hi>Declar'd</hi> to be <hi>Meritorious Services,</hi> from
the <hi>Year</hi> 1680. to <hi>February 1684/5</hi> should now, all on the
Sudden, be Pronounc'd, so <hi>Scandalous,</hi> and <hi>Offensive</hi> to the
<hi>Same Protestant Church,</hi> which <hi>Before</hi> they were thought
to have <hi>Defended:</hi> And All these <hi>Contradictions</hi> at Last, from
many of the very <hi>Same Hands:</hi> Where the <hi>Fault</hi> lyes, is
Submitted to your Lordship to <hi>Determine;</hi> and whether
the <hi>Same Principles;</hi> the <hi>Same Iudgment;</hi> the <hi>Same Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;</hi>
and the <hi>Same Doctrine of CIVIL OBEDIENCE,</hi>
(for I have gone no further) be not as <hi>Warrantable</hi> under
<pb facs="tcp:107112:3"/>
the Reign of our <hi>Present King,</hi> (whom God Preserve) as
they were in the time of <hi>his Late Blessed Majesty.</hi> If it shall
be said that I have <hi>Departed</hi> from my <hi>Self;</hi> I do Freely
Offer-up Seaven or Eight and Forty Years of my Life, to
the <hi>Scrutiny.</hi> And if upon the Strictest Examination of my
<hi>Papers,</hi> and <hi>Actions,</hi> It shall be made Appear, that I am not
the very same Person at <hi>This Day,</hi> that I was in the <hi>First Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish
Rebellion</hi> of 38 and 9. with a respect to the <hi>Religion,</hi> and
<hi>Government,</hi> both of <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> and without any
<hi>Shifting,</hi> either of <hi>Opinion,</hi> or so much as <hi>Outward Pretence</hi>
in the <hi>Interval,</hi> I'le Submit to be <hi>Concluded</hi> by That <hi>Instance.</hi>
(Though I am persuaded (My Lord) that the <hi>Clearest</hi> of
my <hi>Accusers</hi> would be Loth to stand <hi>That Test)</hi> And This,
(under favour) is not <hi>All</hi> neither: For there Occurs yet
<hi>Another Difficulty,</hi> that's as much a <hi>Riddle</hi> as any of the
<hi>Rest;</hi> which is, how the <hi>Same Person</hi> should be so Deadly
an <hi>Eye-Sore</hi> to the <hi>Orthodox Clergy</hi> of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
and yet at the <hi>Same Time,</hi> (if not in the <hi>same Cause)</hi>
be so <hi>Galling</hi> a <hi>Thorn</hi> in the <hi>Sides</hi> of the <hi>Schismatiques.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With your Lordships <hi>Favour,</hi> and <hi>Patience,</hi> for a word
or Two upon <hi>This Part</hi> of my <hi>Case:</hi> If I am an <hi>Enemy</hi> to the
<hi>Church,</hi> I'me a <hi>Friend</hi> to the <hi>Faction;</hi> And yet I find no <hi>Abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
of <hi>Malicious Forgeries,</hi> and <hi>Scandals</hi> against me, from
<hi>That Quarter:</hi> If I'me an <hi>Enemy</hi> to the <hi>Schism,</hi> purely for the
<hi>Churches sake,</hi> I am so far, a <hi>Friend</hi> to the <hi>Church;</hi> And it is
yet my Fortune, to meet with as <hi>Hard Measure</hi> under <hi>Colour</hi>
of <hi>That Interest,</hi> as of the <hi>Other.</hi> Now (my Lord) If my <hi>Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,</hi>
and my <hi>Life</hi> be All of a <hi>piece;</hi> (as after all This <hi>Noise,</hi>
there's not the Least <hi>Shadow</hi> of a <hi>Proof</hi> to the <hi>Contrary)</hi> If both
the One, and the Other have had the Honour, 'till now of
late, of a Fair Interpretation, both as to my <hi>Religion,</hi> and my
<hi>Allegeance:</hi> If I do, at This Moment, stand upon the <hi>Same
Ground,</hi> and Assert the <hi>Same Principles</hi> that ever I did; there
must be either some <hi>Secret Practice,</hi> or some <hi>Dangerous Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>understanding</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:107112:3"/>
in the Bus'ness. And the <hi>Intrigue</hi> is no more then
<hi>This;</hi> The <hi>Common Enemies</hi> of the <hi>Government, Invent,</hi> and
<hi>Spread Scandals</hi> against the <hi>Friends</hi> of it. <hi>They</hi> throw out the
<hi>Bait,</hi> and here and there an <hi>Easy Honest man Swallows</hi> it;
while, under That <hi>Pretext,</hi> the <hi>Designs</hi> of the <hi>Faction</hi> are Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
as the <hi>Sense</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> (as will be set forth more at
large, in This Following Tract.) Your Lordship has not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
Notice, perhaps, that the <hi>Author</hi> of <hi>Iulian the Apostate,</hi> is
of late become a <hi>Famous Stickler</hi> for the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> and
<hi>the Church-of England <hi>as by Law Establish'd,</hi> against <hi>Popery</hi> and
<hi>Papists:</hi>
               </hi> And that he has <hi>Compos'd,</hi> and <hi>Publish'd Three Famous
Papers</hi> upon That Subject: But withall, That as These Three
Papers were <hi>Intended</hi> for <hi>Libells;</hi> so they were <hi>Manag'd</hi> in the
<hi>Dark,</hi> and <hi>Privately</hi> Thrown about the <hi>Streets,</hi> as the most
<hi>Pernicious</hi> of <hi>Libells:</hi> And in fine, to Consummate the <hi>Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
and the <hi>Wickedness</hi> of the <hi>Hypocrisy,</hi> These Papers were
<hi>Written, Design'd,</hi> and <hi>Calculated</hi> for the <hi>Service</hi> of the <hi>Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
it self.</hi> To say nothing of Other Affronts put upon the
<hi>Dignity</hi> of the <hi>Holy Order,</hi> and the <hi>Protestant Profession,</hi> under
the <hi>Same Disguise.</hi> It is, Briefly, my Lord, the very <hi>Train,</hi> and
<hi>Master-piece</hi> of the <hi>Faction,</hi> by a Certain <hi>Sleight of hand,</hi> to get
the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> turn'd up <hi>Trump:</hi> and Then, to Play
their <hi>Own Game</hi> under it. With Permission (my Lord) This
is the <hi>Iust State,</hi> and <hi>True Measure</hi> of the <hi>Case,</hi> both <hi>Publique,</hi>
and <hi>Private.</hi> I had it T'other day from a Person of <hi>Great,</hi> and
<hi>Vnquestionable Honour,</hi> That the very Morning after the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells</hi>
Landed at <hi>Lime,</hi> as they were Discoursing of the <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi>
of their <hi>Vndertaking; [Well!</hi> (says a <hi>Head-Man</hi> among
'em) <hi>If we can but make a Breakfast of Those Rogues,</hi> Jeffreys, <hi>and</hi>
L'Estrange, <hi>we'le never</hi> Repent <hi>the</hi> Hazzards <hi>we are to run.]</hi>
I take it for an <hi>Obligation</hi> that they <hi>Design'd</hi> the <hi>Eating</hi> of me
in so <hi>Good Company:</hi> But (with pardon) it seems somewhat with
the <hi>most</hi> yet, to be <hi>Baited</hi> by <hi>CHRISTIANs,</hi> on the <hi>One</hi>
Hand, and <hi>Worry'd</hi> by <hi>CANNIBALS,</hi> on the <hi>Other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:107112:4"/>
It will become me now to Enform your Lordship, in
Excuse of This Confidence, how <hi>Unwillingly</hi> I came to it.
The <hi>Western Rebellion</hi> has hardly made more <hi>Noise</hi> then
my <hi>Apostacy</hi> to the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and it has given no
small <hi>Reputation</hi> to the <hi>Imposture,</hi> that my <hi>Enemies</hi> have
taken <hi>Sanctuary</hi> in the <hi>Church;</hi> and <hi>Stabb'd</hi> me, even from
behind the <hi>Altar:</hi> So that I could not so much as <hi>Defend</hi>
my self, without some sort of <hi>Irreverence:</hi> And to go fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
would have been little less then <hi>Sacrilege.</hi> It was a
<hi>Dangerous,</hi> and an <hi>Vnkind Dilemma</hi> that I was now put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
Either to <hi>Sink</hi> for want of a <hi>Vindication,</hi> or to run the
<hi>Risque</hi> of <hi>Hurting</hi> my <hi>Mother,</hi> in the Attempt of <hi>Righting</hi>
my self upon some of her <hi>Froward Children:</hi> Upon This
Consideration, I contented my self with the <hi>Middle Course,</hi>
of only Touching upon the Point in question now and
then in an <hi>Observator:</hi> But still, so fast as <hi>One Sham</hi> went-off,
<hi>Another</hi> came on; and finding the Work to be End<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
I made a <hi>Virtue</hi> of my <hi>Misfortune,</hi> and took up a <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophical
Resolution,</hi> of Troubling my Head no further, with
what I could not help. So long as the Fame of my <hi>Levity,</hi>
and <hi>Hypocrisy,</hi> Pass'd only from <hi>hand to hand,</hi> in a <hi>News-Letter,</hi>
by <hi>Word of Mouth,</hi> or upon <hi>Common Hearsay,</hi> I stood
the Shock, without being much Concern'd, whether the
World were <hi>Angry,</hi> or <hi>Pleas'd:</hi> Notwithstanding, that
<hi>Great Names,</hi> and <hi>Authoritys</hi> were laid hold of, to Bolster-up
the <hi>Credit</hi> of the <hi>Report:</hi> But when I came, afterward, to
find <hi>Ten Sheets</hi> of a Book, <hi>Printed,</hi> under the <hi>Title</hi> of
<hi>[The Difference between the</hi> CHURCH <hi>of</hi> ENGLAND, <hi>and
the</hi> CHURCH <hi>of</hi> ROME, <hi>Considered and Stated, according
to such Measures as both do Allow:]</hi> The <hi>Subject</hi> of it, lyable
enough, to stirr up <hi>Vnseasonable Heats:</hi> And <hi>My Self</hi> (at
what Hazzard soever) render'd the <hi>Occasion</hi> of the <hi>Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy;</hi>
As if the <hi>Treatise,</hi> had been only a <hi>Defence of the
Church of England,</hi> in <hi>Reply</hi> to the <hi>Observator,</hi> that had Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb facs="tcp:107112:4"/>
against it. This <hi>Insinuation</hi> was the most <hi>Artificial Essay</hi>
of <hi>Proving</hi> me a <hi>Papist,</hi> that has, as yet, been <hi>Offer'd</hi> at:
And left only <hi>This Choice</hi> before me; Either to <hi>put Pen to Paper,</hi>
in <hi>Denial</hi> of the Charge, or to Stand <hi>Mute,</hi> and <hi>Confess</hi> it.</p>
            <p>You will, I hope, My Lord, Easily Excuse my <hi>Writing,</hi>
under <hi>These Circumstances;</hi> and as <hi>Generously Pardon</hi> the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture</hi>
of This <hi>Dedication,</hi> when you shall find, how In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juriously
my Adversaries have Apply'd the <hi>Countenance</hi> of

of an <hi>Innocent Person.</hi> Neither have I proceeded thus far,

into a Full <hi>Conviction,</hi> that I could not have done Less then
now I do, without being Wanting, both to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and to my self: That is to say; without Appearing
less Sollicitous for the Blessing of your Good Opinion,
then I ought to be.</p>
            <p>It is not yet, (My Lord) that I presume to Beg your

Iustice;</hi> So that my <hi>Petition,</hi> within Those Bounds, is
as Good as <hi>Granted Before-Hand:</hi> But the Sum of my
Humble Request (with Submission) is only <hi>This;</hi> That I
may have leave to Deposite These Sheets in your Lordships
Hand; To the End, that in case of Any Misrepresentation

            <p>THis is only to shew the Reader in a Few Words, how Matters
stand betwixt the Peevish Part of the World, and the <hi>Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vator;</hi>
and it is a <hi>Defence</hi> that I am <hi>forc'd</hi> upon by a Certain
<hi>Printed Paper,</hi> that lays me under the <hi>Absolute Necessity</hi> of a
<hi>Reply:</hi> And, at the same time, gives me as Fair an Opportunity
as I could Wish, of Clearing several <hi>Other Scores, all under One.</hi>
My Work will be the <hi>Easier,</hi> in regard that the most <hi>Popular
Stress</hi> of the <hi>Calumny</hi> against me, is <hi>Discharg'd,</hi> out of the
Mouths of my very <hi>Opposers;</hi> and not without <hi>Manifest Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions</hi>
upon <hi>Themselves</hi> too: Beside the <hi>False Countenances</hi>
that are put upon my <hi>Writings,</hi> &amp; <hi>Meanings,</hi> in Despite of <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar-Rules,</hi>
and of <hi>Common Reason;</hi> which the <hi>Reader</hi> would
have taken <hi>Notice</hi> of without <hi>Telling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the Better <hi>Colour</hi> of the Bus'ness; the <hi>Title</hi> bears the Face
only of <hi>a Consideration</hi> of the <hi>Difference <hi>betwixt the</hi> Two Churches;</hi>
But the <hi>First Sheet</hi> of the <hi>Text</hi> looks quite Another way; and
turns the <hi>Pretended State</hi> of the <hi>Controversy</hi> into a <hi>Stabbing
Reflexion</hi> upon the <hi>Observator:</hi> As who should say, let the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi>
of the <hi>Observators</hi> talk what he will, of <hi>Re-Unions,</hi> and
<hi>Accommodations;</hi> as if there were <hi>no Difference at all,</hi> but in
<hi>Terms,</hi> and <hi>Modalities,</hi> betwixt the Church-of-<hi>England</hi> and the
Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> Here's a Brief <hi>Confutation</hi> of his <hi>Mistake,</hi>
let him <hi>Deny</hi> it if he can. Upon the <hi>Authority</hi> of <hi>This Insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,</hi>
I am presently to be run-down for a <hi>Papist,</hi> without any

                  </hi>
As they could not think the Phrase <hi>Our Religion,</hi>
liable in it self to any just exceptions; so of all
men living, could not they have supposed, that
this Author, who had before treated them with
Respect, and had been so treated by them, should
all o'th' suddain, <hi>without any provocation,</hi> or obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Law he had before offer'd even to the
Dissenters, fall unmercifully upon that little
Phrase, and those that innocently used it; as if
there had been a <hi>secret reserve</hi> in it; and that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the <hi>Cant</hi> (as he is pleased to term it) <hi>of the
Protestant <hi>Religion, the</hi> Reformed <hi>Religion,</hi>

of Two or Three Lines there, I have Good Nature enough
to Forgive All the Rest. <hi>[Of All men Living</hi> (says the

This Passage, has in a Great Measure Unveil'd the <hi>Mystery;</hi>
and laid Open the very <hi>Root</hi> of All the Following <hi>Misun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings.</hi>
Alas! I was a <hi>Protestant;</hi> a Person in <hi>Credit,</hi>
and <hi>Treated with Respect,</hi> 'till This Unlucky <hi>[All o'th'

<hi>a Very Honest Man,</hi> and a <hi>Good Protestant;</hi> a <hi>True Son of
the Church,</hi> and a <hi>Loyal Subject</hi> to his <hi>Majesty,</hi> 'till the <hi>Three
and Twentieth of February Last past;</hi> which was the <hi>Precise
Date</hi> of the <hi>Bloudy Observator</hi> that has wrought me all this
<hi>Woe.</hi> There was No Notice taken as yet, of the Story of
my <hi>Massing-it</hi> at <hi>Somerset-House</hi> 1680. Not a Word said,
of my <hi>Siding with the Loyal Papists</hi> at <hi>Worcester,</hi> against
the <hi>Rebellious Pretended Protestants</hi> there, in my <hi>Observators</hi>
of <hi>May,</hi> 1683. No Talk as yet of <hi>Modalities,</hi> and <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations;</hi>
though I gave the World <hi>more Pretence</hi> for it
in <hi>Eighty One,</hi> then ever I did <hi>since:</hi> But now <hi>[All o'th'
Sudden]</hi> I'm a <hi>Papist;</hi> a <hi>Renegade,</hi> &amp;c. And All, long of
That <hi>Vnpardonable Observator. Vol. 3. Num.</hi> 7. Wherefore
I cannot do better then Remit my self to That very Paper,
and leave the <hi>World</hi> to <hi>Iudge,</hi> upon an <hi>Equal Hearing,</hi>
whether of the Two is the more to Blame, the <hi>Considerer,</hi>
or the <hi>Observator.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Only One Word by the way, to the Articles of my
<hi>Charge. First,</hi> I am made a <hi>Ridiculer</hi> of the <hi>Address</hi> of the
<hi>London-Clergy;</hi> for the <hi>Phrase,</hi> of <hi>[Our Religion.]</hi> Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
<hi>2ly, [His Majesties Gracious Assurance to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend

of the <hi>Presenters,</hi> and the <hi>Solemnity</hi> of <hi>Presenting</hi> it, I

make it no better then [<hi>a</hi> Cant; <hi>and as if there were some
Secret Reserve <hi>in't:]</hi>
                  </hi> To this I say, First; that the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderer</hi>
Cannot Apply the <hi>Descant</hi> upon <hi>[Our Religion]</hi>
to the <hi>London-Clergy</hi> without making them <hi>Schismatiques.</hi>
Neither does the <hi>Address</hi> run in the <hi>Style</hi> of <hi>[Our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;]</hi>
but <hi>[Our Religion, Establisht by Law.] <hi>2ly,</hi>
                  </hi>
Neither is it the <hi>Phrase</hi> of his Majesties <hi>Declaration</hi> it self.

Preserve This Government both in Church and State; as it is

to the <hi>Schismatiques,</hi> that All the Force in the World
cannot draw from them <hi>Any Other Meaning:</hi> So that Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the <hi>Whole Charge</hi> falls to the <hi>Ground;</hi> or he Confounds
the <hi>Church,</hi> with the <hi>Schism.</hi> Beside, that the <hi>Cavil</hi> Amounts
to no more then a Bare <hi>Supposition,</hi> or the <hi>Fiction</hi> of a <hi>Case,</hi>
where the <hi>Observator</hi> is made to Condemn a Thing that

                  </hi> but <hi>might <hi>possibly</hi> have been;</hi> which Casts the

Harmony</hi> of <hi>Confession,</hi> &amp;c. In fine; <hi>Heaven</hi> and
<hi>Earth</hi> may be as soon brought <hi>together</hi> as <hi>These Oppositions:</hi>
Nor could These <hi>Illusions</hi> ever have Pass'd upon Any Other

only upon the <hi>Schism,</hi> but to put the Matter past the very
<hi>Possibility,</hi> (as a body would think) of a <hi>Misconstruction,</hi>
there are I know not how many <hi>Savings</hi> of <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,</hi>

also be despised with it (tho' we did as little
deserve, as expect it from him) yet we think our

the Nobility of his Family, deserves so well of the

Flatters me in the Name of the <hi>London-Clergy,</hi>
that They might have <hi>Forgiven</hi> me perhaps, if it had not

               <p>6. That Religion,<note place="margin">Consid.</note> we say, <hi>now Established by Law,</hi>
in opposition, both to Fanatacism and Popery;
and from the Opposition it bears to the last of

               </p>
               <p>6. If the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Notes.</note> 
                  <hi>Established by Law,</hi> stands
in <hi>Opposition</hi> to <hi>Phanaticism,</hi> (as the <hi>Considerer</hi> says it does)
the <hi>Phanatiques</hi> are No <hi>Protestants:</hi> Neither are They pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly,

not Insist upon <hi>Strictnesses,</hi> and <hi>Criticisms;</hi> But I reckon it
a Thing much to be <hi>Wish'd,</hi> since the <hi>Confounding</hi> of the
<hi>Church-<hi>Protestants,</hi>
                  </hi> and the <hi>True-<hi>Protestants,</hi>
                  </hi> (so Call'd) is

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:107112:11"/>
may be Differenc'd, One from Another, in the very <hi>Style,</hi> by
some Note of <hi>Discrimination.</hi> As for the Purpose; I am of
the <hi>Protestant,</hi> of the <hi>Reformed <hi>Religion,</hi>
                  </hi> says a <hi>Canonical
Church-man:</hi> And so am I too, says <hi>Every Mouth of the
<hi>Schism;</hi>
                  </hi> and so it holds T'other way, <hi>Vice Versâ,</hi> which
looks as if Those <hi>Within</hi> the Pale, and Those <hi>Without,</hi>
were <hi>All One.</hi> To Conclude, <hi>[Establish'd by Law]</hi> Sets
All <hi>Right,</hi> and Solves All <hi>Difficulties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. But if the Case betwixt the Church of <hi>England</hi>
and <hi>Rome,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Consid.</note> betwixt Popery and those that have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
from it, be as this Ingenious Person has (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wittingly
we hope) represented it, <hi>Our Lives</hi> may
well be <hi>dearer</hi> to us than our Religion: And if we
will yet profess <hi>Our Religion to be dearer to us, than
our Lives;</hi> it must either be perverse Obstinacy, or
gross Delusion, egregious Folly, or lewd Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisy.</p>
               <p>7. Here's <hi>more Holy-water,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Notes.</note> yet. <hi>[This <hi>Ingenious</hi> Person has
(<hi>Unwittingly,</hi> we hope,</hi> &amp;c.) <hi>so Desperately</hi> Mis-Stated <hi>the</hi>

<hi>T'other way, and made our <hi>Lives</hi>
                  </hi> Dearer to us then

Egregious Folly,</hi> and <hi>Lewd Hypocrisy:]</hi> For I am
persuaded, if we look'd well about us, we might find <hi>Some</hi>
Persons of <hi>That Iudgment,</hi> that Think Themselves in the
<hi>Right</hi> in't: And <hi>Others,</hi> that are neither <hi>Fools,</hi> nor <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites;</hi>
nor to be Expos'd to the World under <hi>That Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter:</hi>
But he has now laid his Finger upon the <hi>Sore;</hi> and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Sin</hi> that is <hi>never to be Forgiven.</hi> And yet after All
These <hi>Mortal Errors, Transgressions,</hi> and <hi>Pompous Aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
he does <hi>Himself</hi> Clear me, in the very <hi>Next Paragraph</hi>
(and in the Name of the <hi>Church-of-England</hi> still) of Every
<hi>Article</hi> of my <hi>Charge:</hi> And in That, and the Following
Clause, he comes-up to the Uttermost Syllable of what I
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:107112:11"/>
ever said: Insomuch, that He who but Just now made me
such an <hi>Apostate,</hi> that he could not Forbear Writing against
me without being <hi>False to his Religion,</hi> is now <hi>Iudicially
Wrought upon,</hi> by an <hi>Over-Ruling Impulse,</hi> to do me <hi>Iustice,</hi> in
an Express <hi>Confirmation</hi> of the <hi>Truth</hi> of My <hi>Opinions,</hi> and in
as <hi>Point-Blanck</hi> a <hi>Contradiction</hi> to the <hi>Profession</hi> of his <hi>Own:</hi>
So that the <hi>Next Two Clauses,</hi> are Kind in Several Respects:
And in regard of the <hi>Connexion</hi> and <hi>Dependence,</hi> One upon
Another, we'le take 'em Both together.</p>
               <p>8. <hi>We will allow to this worthy Gentleman,<note place="margin">Consid.</note>
all the deference his Parts and his Pen do deserve. We
allow him to be what he professeth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Observa. 6. &amp; 10.</note> A Catholick of
the Church of <hi>England, or a</hi> Church of <hi>England</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant.
<hi>We allow him</hi> not to forget the Christian, the
Generous, and the Friendly Obligations, that many of
the Roman Catholiques have laid upon him. <hi>Lastly, Let
us allow that</hi> there are some points in the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Num. 6.</note> wherein, tho we differ in Modalities and Terms,
we agree yet in the same meaning. <hi>And that</hi> there are
some other points, wherein the matter is capable of such
Condescentions and Abatements, as both sides might very
well close upon, with a just deference to Christ<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> Charity,
and without offence to the Catholique Faith: <hi>Yet after
all these Concessions, we do most certainly believe,
and seriously affirm, that there are many other
points, in which neither</hi> Modalities <hi>and</hi> Terms, <hi>do
make the difference; nor is</hi> the matter capable of such
Condescentions and Abatements, as both sides might well
close upon, without offence to the Catholique Faith.</p>
               <p>9. That is,<note place="margin">Consid.</note> there are many things, they hold, and
we do deny; such again as we hold, and they do
deny, that with all the <hi>Condesentions</hi> and <hi>Abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:107112:12"/>
can never be Accomodated; nor we with
all <hi>the Christian Charity</hi> be reconciled; unless we
are so base as against Truth and Reason, to go over
in those points wholly to them, or Almighty God
shall open their Eyes, so to discern it, that they
come fully over to us.</p>
               <p>8. 9. I must be very <hi>Copious</hi> now,<note place="margin">Notes.</note> upon This Subject, to be
very <hi>Clear:</hi> And it is Certainly worth my while too, when
the <hi>Stress</hi> that's laid upon the <hi>Cause in hand,</hi> is made, not
only Matter of <hi>Life and Death;</hi> but of <hi>Heaven and Hell</hi>
too: For if ever we live to see <hi>the second Part of Otes'es Plot,</hi>
there will be both <hi>Hanging,</hi> aud <hi>Damning</hi> too, in the <hi>Case.</hi>
In the First Place he Allows me to be <hi>[a Catholique of the
Church-of-England, or a Church-of-England Protestant,]</hi> which
will hardly Consist, with his making me afterward, <hi>more then
Half a Papist.</hi> Now if he had Intended <hi>Candidly,</hi> and an
<hi>Impartial Iustice,</hi> upon the Question about <hi>My Religion;</hi> there
was enough in the <hi>Paragraph</hi> of <hi>Obs. 6. Vol.</hi> 3. whence he
took This, to have Answer'd That Point beyond All Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy:
But his Bus'ness was to <hi>Bring me <hi>On,</hi>
                  </hi> not to <hi>Bring
me <hi>Off:</hi>
                  </hi> And so I must e'en do <hi>That Right</hi> for <hi>My self,</hi> which
<hi>He</hi> would not do <hi>for</hi> me. The Words of the <hi>Citation,</hi> in
<hi>Connexion,</hi> are <hi>These.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The Question upon the Matter here before us, is Briefly
This; Not whether the <hi>Ingenious Worthy Man of Parts,</hi> be
a <hi>Protestant,</hi> or a <hi>Papist;</hi> but whether he be a <hi>Christian</hi> or
no: Nay a <hi>Pagan</hi> would not have made so Bold with his <hi>Idol,</hi>
as I have, upon This Occasion, with my <hi>Maker;</hi> if I have not
here Deliver'd the <hi>Truth,</hi> without <hi>Guile,</hi> or <hi>Reserve.</hi> And I
am Mistaken too, if the <hi>Charity</hi> of <hi>Believing</hi> me, be not as
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:107112:13"/>
much a <hi>Christian Duty,</hi> on the <hi>One Hand,</hi> as the <hi>Sincerity</hi> of
the <hi>Protestations</hi> I have here made, is on the <hi>Other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In his <hi>Next Citation</hi> out of <hi>Obs.</hi> 10. He passes over These
Words at the Beginning of the Same Period. <hi>[Though I am
not of the Religion of the Roman Catholiques] <hi>I can never
forget,</hi>
                  </hi> &amp;c.] The <hi>Considerer,</hi> I perceive, had much rather make
the world believe that I am a <hi>Papist,</hi> then Cite Any <hi>Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
or <hi>Oaths of Mine,</hi> to the <hi>Contrary;</hi> And yet now <hi>[All
o'th Sudden]</hi> he comes <hi>Over</hi> to me; and we <hi>Agree,</hi> like Two
<hi>Tallys:</hi> Unless it be, that He <hi>Out-does</hi> me, even in my <hi>Own
Proposition:</hi> For he speaks <hi>Positively,</hi> both to the <hi>[Some
Points;]</hi> and to the <hi>[Some Other Points;]</hi> To which I
only put my <hi>Naked Belief:</hi> But the Surest way is to Referr
to the Text it self.</p>
               <p>[There are <hi>Some Points</hi> in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Obs. 6. V. 3.</note> wherein
<hi>[I veryly Believe]</hi> though we <hi>Differ</hi> in <hi>Modalities</hi> and

Points</hi> wherein <hi>[I do As veryly Believe]</hi> the Matter Capable
of Such <hi>Condescentions,</hi> and <hi>Abatements,</hi> as <hi>Both sides</hi> might
very well <hi>Close</hi> upon, with a <hi>Just Deference</hi> to <hi>Christian Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi>
and without <hi>Offence</hi> to the <hi>Catholique Faith. Obs. Num.
6. Vol. 3.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let Any man Compare the <hi>Considerer</hi> now, upon This
Point with the <hi>Observator;</hi> and he shall find them to be Both
so perfectly of a Mind, upon the <hi>Desperate Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalities,</hi>
and <hi>Accommodable Differences,</hi> in <hi>[Some Points,]</hi>
and in <hi>[Some Other Points]</hi> that they Agree in the very
<hi>Same Words,</hi> and <hi>Syllables:</hi> But there are <hi>Many Other Points,</hi>
he says, wherein <hi>the Matter is Not Capable of such Condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Abatements,</hi> &amp;c.] This he says, §. 8. But then
within Two or Three Lines After, in § 9. He <hi>Qualifies</hi> the
Matter, and <hi>Vnsays</hi> it again; Though he's at <hi>Variance</hi> with
<hi>Himself</hi> too, in <hi>That very Section.</hi> He pronounces <hi>Peremptorily,</hi>
that <hi>All the <hi>Condescentions</hi> and <hi>Abatements,</hi>
                  </hi> or <hi>All the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Charity</hi>
                  </hi> in the World, will do no Good, in <hi>Many Cases:</hi>
But then he brings himself off, with an <hi>[VNLESS we are so
Base, as against Truth and Reason, to go over in Those Points
wholly to Them; or Almighty God shall open Their Eyes, to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:107112:13"/>
Discern it that they come fully over to us.]</hi> That is to say <hi>Those
Points</hi> can <hi>Not</hi> be <hi>Accommodated;</hi> unless it pleases God that
they <hi>May</hi> be <hi>Accommodated:</hi> And I could Wish now, that
<hi>Those Points</hi> had been <hi>Nam'd,</hi> which he says <hi>[We Hold,]
<hi>and</hi> [They Deny.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to speak more Expressly to his <hi>Ninth Section;</hi> I wou'd
fain know, if the very <hi>Words</hi> of the <hi>Observator, Vol. 3. Num.
10.</hi>
do not <hi>Import</hi> the <hi>Self Same Conception,</hi> and <hi>Vnderstanding</hi>
of the Matter with what He <hi>Delivers. i.e.. [It is not Expos'd
as the</hi> Project <hi>of a Thing</hi> Probable; <hi>but in a</hi> Charitable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
of the <hi>Possibility</hi> of it, by a <hi>Providential Removal
of Those</hi> Passions, <hi>and</hi> Prejudices <hi>that <hi>Hinder the</hi> Agreement.]</hi>
He goes now forward, to <hi>Deny</hi> in the <hi>Next Paragraph,</hi> what
he has <hi>Admitted</hi> in <hi>This.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>10. This is truly <hi>the Matter in question.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Consid.</note> It is not,
whether there be not <hi>Truth as well as Error in the
case: and the one may not then be separated from the
other</hi> (as this Gentleman mistakes;) but whether
there be not in the Doctrine of that Church which
we oppose, Error without Truth; and whether the
main matters in dispute betwixt Church and
Church, which the one faith is Truth, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
saith is Error, be capable of such <hi>condescentions
and abatements as both sides might well close upon,</hi> &amp;c.
And that for example, the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which
requires Purgatory to be believed under an <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema;</hi>
and the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which saith,
<hi>it's a fond thing, vainly invented,</hi> &amp;c. can be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
without those that hold, <hi>it is a fond thing
vainly invented,</hi> do make it an <hi>Article</hi> of their <hi>Faith,</hi>
or those that hold it an <hi>Article</hi> of their <hi>Faith,</hi> do
declare it's a <hi>fond, a vain, and a false thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>10. This <hi>Paragraph,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Notes.</note> I must Confess, is too Hard for me:
For I cannot Conceive, why the <hi>Superstructure</hi> of <hi>Error</hi> upon
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:107112:14"/>
                  <hi>Truth,</hi> may not as well be <hi>Taken-<hi>off,</hi>
                  </hi> as it was <hi>Laid-<hi>on:</hi>
                  </hi> For
it is not be Imagin'd, that <hi>Error</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> can be so <hi>Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated,</hi>
as to become <hi>Inseparable.</hi> When I speak of <hi>Error,</hi>
and <hi>Truth</hi> in the Case, it is to be Understood, with a Respect
to the Points in <hi>Difference</hi> betwixt the <hi>Two Churches:</hi> And
whether it be <hi>Error <hi>Without</hi> Truth,</hi> or <hi>Error Accompany'd
With <hi>Truth,</hi>
                  </hi> 'tis <hi>as Broad as 'tis Long. That,</hi> indeed, which
the <hi>One</hi> says is <hi>Truth,</hi> and the <hi>Other</hi> says is <hi>Error,</hi> can never
be <hi>Reconcil'd,</hi> so long as <hi>Both Parties</hi> Adhere to That <hi>Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition;</hi>
for that were to suppose <hi>Error,</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> to be all
One. But <hi>[His <hi>VNLESS;]</hi>
                  </hi> and <hi>[My <hi>PROVIDENTIAL
REMOVAL]</hi>
                  </hi> takes <hi>That Rubb</hi> out of the <hi>Way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>11. An Accommodation in such a case is <hi>Impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Consid.</note>
For (as our Author well observes upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
occasion) <hi>it imports an agreement of two divided
Chuches in the very state of their disagreement;</hi>
where not the <hi>passions and prejudices</hi> of men, but
the Nature of the things, <hi>hinder the Agreement;</hi>
and so spoils the Philosophy of <hi>a charitable contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation</hi>
about the <hi>possibility</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>11. 'Tis very <hi>True;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Notes.</note> that an <hi>Accomodation</hi> (as he says) is
<hi>Impracticable,</hi> where it is <hi>Impossible;</hi> And it is no less True,
that it is <hi>Impossible,</hi> so long as People that are of <hi>Differing
Persuasions, Continue</hi> in That <hi>Hostile State of Disagreement:</hi>
But <hi>Change of Mind</hi> removes <hi>That Obstacle;</hi> And <hi>the Grace
of Almighty God</hi> (as He Himself Confesses in the Former Page)
may work that <hi>Change of Mind.</hi> Now here's no <hi>Change</hi> all
this while, in the <hi>Nature</hi> of the Thing, but in the <hi>Opinion</hi> of
it: <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Error</hi> are the Same still that they were <hi>before;</hi>
And I know very well, that 'tis <hi>Impossible</hi> to make <hi>Truth</hi> to
be <hi>Error,</hi> or <hi>Error</hi> to be <hi>Truth:</hi> But what's This to the <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,</hi>
and <hi>Prejudices</hi> of Men, that may be <hi>Taken-up,</hi> or <hi>Lay'd-down,</hi>
allmost at <hi>Pleasure?</hi> The <hi>Inconciliable Opposition</hi> of
<hi>Vice,</hi> and <hi>Virtue,</hi> does not at all hinder, but that Men of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligate
Lives,</hi> and <hi>Vicious Habits,</hi> may yet <hi>Reclaim,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:107112:14"/>
                  <hi>Virtuous. Ambition, Avarice, Cruelty,</hi> and <hi>Oppression,</hi>
can never be Transform'd into the <hi>Opposite <hi>Uirtues:</hi>
                  </hi> But
<hi>Men</hi> that are Addicted to <hi>Those Vices</hi> may Cast their <hi>Skins<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> &amp;
Pass-over into the <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> of <hi>Humility, Moderation,
Tenderness, Compassion,</hi> without a <hi>Miracle.</hi> And it were <hi>Hard,
Otherwise;</hi> If (according to the Sense of my Expositors,)
the most <hi>Necessary Duties</hi> of a <hi>Christian;</hi> That is to say, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi>
and <hi>a New Life,</hi> should be Render'd only the <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
Contemplation of a thing <hi>Impossible.</hi> This</hi> is a <hi>Doctrine,</hi>
that seems to Me, (with Submission to be better Enform'd) to
<hi>Block-up the way,</hi> and to <hi>Preclude the Means,</hi> even of <hi>Salvation
it self:</hi> For if <hi>All men Living</hi> have their <hi>Errours,</hi> and their
<hi>Failings;</hi> And, when they are once <hi>Out</hi> of the <hi>Way,</hi> if there
be no getting <hi>Back;</hi> How miserable is the Condition of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,</hi>
that stands <hi>Condemn'd,</hi> at the same Time, to <hi>Inevitable
Frailties,</hi> and to <hi>Vnpardonable Mistakes!</hi> I will Allow all the
<hi>Stress</hi> that can be lay'd upon the most Potent Obstructions to
This Blessed End; As the <hi>Affectation</hi> of <hi>Power,</hi> and <hi>Dominion;</hi>
The <hi>Charms</hi> of <hi>Glory,</hi> and of <hi>Secular Interest;</hi> Or the <hi>Prepos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions</hi>
of <hi>Education.</hi> These <hi>Impressions</hi> make the Matter <hi>Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult;</hi>
But not <hi>Insuperable,</hi> and <hi>Vtterly Impossible:</hi> Especially
(As the <hi>Considerer</hi> says) <hi>[If Allmighty God shall Vouchsafe to
Open the Eyes of the Deceived, so as to make them Discern Truth
and Reason;]</hi> Or in the Words of the <hi>Observaor,</hi> in case of
<hi>[A Providential Removal of Those Passions, and Prejudices, that
Hinder the Agreement.]</hi> This is the <hi>Possibility</hi> that I <hi>Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate:</hi>
And I take the <hi>Considerers [ALLMIGHTY GOD]</hi>
and the <hi>Observators [PROVIDENCE]</hi> to Intend <hi>One and
the Same Power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>12. This is the Case we except against,<note place="margin">Consid.</note> and which
we shall now proceed to the consideration of; not
that we declare, to lessen the esteem of this Author
(whom we do honour for his Ingenuity and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry,
and his other Accomplishments worthy
of a Gentleman and a Scholar) but to Vindicate
our Church, and to preserve our People from

the Infection of such Doctrine; which how <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natured</hi>
soever it may be in the design, cannot but
be mischievous and pernicious in the consequents.</p>
               <p>12 I must needs put the same Complement,<note place="margin">Notes.</note> in this case, upon
the <hi>Considerer,</hi> that an <hi>Italian Prince</hi> put upon a Gentleman that
gave him a <hi>Lift</hi> to Help him into the <hi>Saddle.</hi> He was a <hi>Light
Person of a Man:</hi> And the <hi>Other</hi> Threw him quite <hi>over his
Horse:</hi> The <hi>Prince</hi> got up again; And, with his Cap in his
hand, <hi>Sr,</hi> (says he) <hi>the One Halfe of This Courtesy would have
done My Bus'ness.</hi> In like manner, I would have <hi>Compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
with the <hi>Considerer,</hi> with all my heart, for his <hi>Civilities</hi>
to the <hi>[Gentleman]</hi> and the <hi>[Scholar,]</hi> if he would but
have <hi>Excus'd</hi> me from the <hi>Infamy</hi> of a <hi>Defamer</hi> of the <hi>Charch,</hi>
and a <hi>Spreader</hi> of <hi>Infectious Doctrines.</hi> I do not speak This,
<hi>[to Lessen the Esteem of the Author;]</hi> but purely to <hi>Preserve
my Self</hi> from the <hi>Consequences</hi> of so <hi>Infectious</hi> a <hi>Calumny:</hi> And
a <hi>Calumny,</hi> (for ought yet appears,) without Any <hi>Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
The <hi>Clause</hi> runs in the Style of <hi>[WE Except against]
WE Declare] WE do Honour] OVR Church]</hi> and <hi>OVR Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:]</hi>
So that the <hi>Censure</hi> falls little short of an <hi>Anathema,</hi>
for it appears here to be <hi>Publish'd,</hi> as out of <hi>the Mouth of the
Church it Self.</hi> And what's my <hi>Crime</hi> at last now but the
Poor Innocent Observator of <hi>Feb. 23. Last Past?</hi> For my
<hi>[Modalities,]</hi> &amp; All that Train of <hi>True-Protestant Clamours,</hi>
and <hi>Scruples</hi> are <hi>Approv'd,</hi> and <hi>Allow'd <hi>of</hi>

Things: And I do not hear of so much as One Syllable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to my <hi>Charge,</hi> upon this Subject. So that upon the <hi>Main;</hi>

There's <hi>Popery,</hi> there's <hi>Heresy;</hi> there's <hi>Scandal;</hi> There's
<hi>Insolence,</hi> and <hi>In Manners</hi> in 'em; For till <hi>That Malevolent

The <hi>Considerer Himself</hi> Dates the <hi>Quarrel</hi> from that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi>

               <p>13. Our Author is pleased to affirm,<note place="margin">Consid. Observa. Num. 3.</note> That the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of the Papists are known and certain.</hi> A propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
which cannot be universally true, since they
are far from an agreement even in such points as are
of the greatest importance for them to agree in.
Such is that of Infallibility, which whether it be in
the Pope without a Council, or a Council without
the Pope, or Pope and Council, or the Church
Diffusive, they cannot agree nor determine. But
supposing, that their Principles <hi>are known and certain,</hi>
where may we expect to find them, if not in their
Councils, General and Provincial; in their Canons
and Decrees, in their allow'd Catechisms and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Professions of Faith, in their publique Offices
and approved Comments on Scripture? but if these
be not admitted, we must despair of satisfaction,
and have reason to conclude, their <hi>Principles</hi> are
neither <hi>known nor certain.</hi>

                  </hi> Principles <hi>are <hi>Known</hi> and
<hi>Certain;</hi> The <hi>Other Unnaccountable,</hi> and <hi>Uagabond]</hi>
                  </hi> And
so afterward; <hi>[The</hi> One <hi>Supposes a <hi>Doctrinal</hi>
                  </hi> Union; <hi>And
the</hi> Other <hi>Demands a <hi>Political,</hi>
                  </hi> &amp;c.] Now there is a Great
Difference, betwixt a <hi>Positive,</hi> and a <hi>Comparative Affirmation:</hi>
So that he puts the Case upon the <hi>Stretch,</hi> to make it the <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer:</hi>
Though 'tis the Same thing to <hi>Me,</hi> whether it be the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:107112:16"/>
                  <hi>One,</hi> or the <hi>Other;</hi> for I'm <hi>Right, Both</hi> ways, as to <hi>My Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</hi>
If <hi>their Principles be <hi>Not</hi> Known and Certain,</hi> there's One
<hi>Stabbing Argument</hi> against the <hi>Papists</hi> fall'n to the <hi>Ground.</hi>
That is to say, the Involving of the People of <hi>That Persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi>
to the <hi>Last Man</hi> of 'em, in the <hi>Common Principle</hi> of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying</hi>
(as they call them) <hi>Heretical Princes:</hi> For the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>captacle</hi>
of <hi>Infallibility,</hi> is a <hi>Point</hi> (as he says, <hi>p. 6.)</hi> that is
not as yet <hi>Agreed,</hi> or <hi>Determin'd</hi> among <hi>Themselves:</hi> But if
they Bee <hi>Known,</hi> and <hi>Certain;</hi> I have nothing more to say.
Neither is it One Jot to the Bus'ness of <hi>That Observator,</hi>
which Respects only the <hi>Disparity</hi> betwixt <hi>Vniting</hi> in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of <hi>Doctrine</hi> with men of <hi>Another <hi>Religion;</hi>
                  </hi> and <hi>Vniting</hi>
with men that pretend to be of <hi>Our Own Religion,</hi> in <hi>Political
Maxims,</hi> and <hi>Positions,</hi> which are <hi>Subversive</hi> of the <hi>Civil State.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>14. As for the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Consid.</note>
we can freely declare it to be <hi>known</hi> and <hi>certain.</hi> The
sum of what we hold, is drawn up in Nine and
Thirty Articles, explained in one and Twenty <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,</hi>
&amp; the way of our Worship exhibited in our
Liturgy. From hence we shall therefore collect our
Materials, and, according to the method of our
Articles, compare Doctrine with Doctrine, Church
with Church; by which we doubt not but to make
the Opposition between them so evident, that both
sides will agree, that the <hi>Church of England is one
thing and the Church of Rome another;</hi> and, <hi>as they
are at present,</hi> no more capable of being, one, than
Truth and Error can be the same.</p>
               <p>In order to which we shall premise.</p>
               <p>14. This looks, as if the <hi>Observator</hi> had stood-up For the
<hi>Principles</hi> of the <hi>Papists,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Notes.</note> Against the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the Church-of-<hi>England,</hi>
and, Consequently, <hi>Extorted</hi> from the <hi>Vnwilling
Author,</hi> These Papers, in <hi>Vindication</hi> of the <hi>Protestant Religion;</hi>
when yet the <hi>Observator</hi> has not Presum'd, in <hi>Any sort,</hi> or
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:107112:16"/>
upon <hi>Any Occasion,</hi> to <hi>[Touch the Ark;]</hi> but Kept himself
within the Bounds of <hi>Political Remarques,</hi> and <hi>Disquisitions,</hi>
in Order to the Service of the <hi>State,</hi> without Breaking-in
upon the <hi>Offices,</hi> and <hi>Duties</hi> of the <hi>Reverend Clergy</hi> in <hi>Any
Degree Whatsoever.</hi> Now I shall Easily Joyn with him, that
<hi>[the Church-of</hi>-England <hi>is</hi> One <hi>Thing, and the Church of</hi>
Rome, Another:] But it is yet as <hi>Possible</hi> that they may come
to be <hi>One <hi>Again,</hi>
                  </hi> as it was, before the <hi>Separation,</hi> that they
should come to be <hi>Divided.</hi> I'le break No Squares with him
neither, upon <hi>This Point;</hi> that <hi>[as they are at present, they
are no more Capable of being</hi> One, <hi>then</hi> Truth <hi>and</hi> Error <hi>can be
the Same;]</hi> which is no more then to say, that <hi>White</hi> can
never be <hi>Black,</hi> so long as 'tis <hi>White;</hi> nor <hi>Black, White,</hi> so
long as 'tis <hi>Black.</hi> But now though the <hi>Error,</hi> or the <hi>Vice</hi> can
never <hi>Change Colour,</hi> the <hi>Offender</hi> may Quit an <hi>Ill Habit,</hi> and
leave his <hi>Wickedness behind</hi> him; And the most <hi>Mistaken Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
in the world, may be brought out of <hi>Darkness</hi> into <hi>Light:</hi>
So that the <hi>Considerer</hi> might have sav'd himself the Labour
of <hi>Iumbling <hi>Doctrines</hi>
                  </hi> together, and <hi>Conferring <hi>Articles,</hi>
                  </hi> upon
Any Account, (That is to say, of the <hi>Observators:)</hi> For the
<hi>Virtues</hi> of the <hi>Load-stone,</hi> or <hi>the Squaring of a Circle,</hi> would
have been a <hi>Subject,</hi> Every jot as much to the Question in
hand (for any thing that I have to do in the Case) as the
<hi>Stating,</hi> and <hi>Ballancing</hi> the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Two Churches.</hi>
               </p>

written in opposition to our Articles,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>16. But of these Articles it is to be observed,<note place="margin">Consid.</note> there
are some which each party differs as much from the
other in (when they come to explain themselves) as
if there had been no agreement in Terms. Thus it
happens in Articles, <hi>3d, 7th,</hi> and 15; as shall after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
be shewed.</p>
               <p>15. 16. This <hi>Enumeration</hi> of <hi>Articles,</hi> is Nothing at all to

               </p>
               <p>17. 2ly. <hi>There are other Articles,<note place="margin">Consid.</note> wherein both
Churches do agree in the sence, tho they differ in
Terms; or that are not so much Controversies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Church and Church, as between private Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters
in each Church. Of this Opinion is a</hi> Learned
Forreigner of the Reformed Religion, <hi>about the
matter contained in Articles the</hi> 10th <hi>and</hi> 17th, of
Free-will; <hi>and</hi> of Predestination and Election. <hi>Of
the former he saith,</hi> The difference that our Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries

latter he concludes;</hi> Since we agree in the Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls
of this Doctrine (as we have already set forth);
and that our dissent is but with a few of their Doctors,
it would not be very hard (I should think) to find out
such a biass of Temperament,<note place="margin">1681. Part. 4. Cap. 3. pag. 133. 150.</note> drawn from the Word of
God, in proposing of these Opinions, and in Terms so
proportioned to their sublimity; as all humble and
moderate Spirits would find sufficient for their satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>

17. The <hi>Apology</hi> here-cited, was <hi>Translated</hi> by my self, and
Published with my <hi>Name at length</hi> to't, in 1681. The <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderer</hi>
is pleas'd to give the Author of it, the <hi>Character</hi> of
<hi>[A Learned Forreigner of the Reformed Religion.]</hi> How comes
This <hi>[Learned Forreigner,]</hi> (and so Call'd with a Respect to
<hi>This very Piece)</hi> to keep up <hi>His Reputation</hi> still, as a <hi>Professor</hi>
of the <hi>Reformed <hi>Religion,</hi>
                  </hi> and the <hi>Observator</hi> to be a <hi>Lost
Man,</hi> to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> past all <hi>Remission,</hi> for not
the Fiftieth part of the <hi>Liberty</hi> that the <hi>Other</hi> has taken? Or
rather, How comes a <hi>Protestant</hi> of <hi>Eighty-One,</hi> upon the very
<hi>Same Foundation,</hi> to be made a <hi>Papist</hi> in <hi>Eighty-Five?</hi> But
the <hi>Partiality</hi> will be yet more Obvious, from the <hi>Project</hi> and
the <hi>Title</hi> of That <hi>Apology:</hi> An Instance, which, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
I might have <hi>forgotten,</hi> if the <hi>Quotation</hi> had not brought
it into my <hi>Mind.</hi> The <hi>Title,</hi> in <hi>French,</hi> and <hi>English,</hi> is as

                  </hi> for a <hi>Reunion,</hi> is highly
<hi>Recommended</hi> and <hi>Approv'd;</hi> While at the same time, the <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
Speculation,</hi> but of the <hi>Possibility</hi> of it, is made a
<hi>Mortal Sin</hi> in the <hi>Observator.</hi> The Three next Clauses

or a <hi>Mad-man,</hi> to have laid my self open to <hi>any other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction:</hi>
For I might as well pretend to <hi>Reconcile Heaven and
Hell,</hi> as <hi>Truth and Error; Sound Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Heresie.</hi> And
I am Afraid, there has been more care taken to <hi>Puzzle</hi> my
Meaning, than to <hi>Understand</hi> it, though I Hope that the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderer</hi>
has been rather <hi>Misled himself,</hi> than a <hi>Willing <hi>Mislead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>

               </p>
               <p>If it be a <hi>Laudable Project,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Notes.</note> 'tis <hi>Well meant,</hi> and no hurt

of seeing it put in practice; And I am as much for the
<hi>Renunciation</hi> of <hi>Destructive Principles,</hi> as the <hi>Considerer Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;</hi>
And for making that <hi>Disclaimer,</hi> the <hi>Condition</hi> of the
<hi>Agreement.</hi> As to the <hi>Hazard</hi> that may Befall the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
[our Religion]</hi> and <hi>our Selves,</hi> as well by <hi>Credulity,</hi> as
by <hi>Distrust;</hi> the <hi>Danger</hi> is not so much in <hi>Each</hi> of them <hi>Singly,</hi>
as in <hi>Both Together;</hi> where <hi>Credulity</hi> towards a <hi>Faction,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
<hi>Fears</hi> and <hi>Iealousies</hi> of the <hi>Magistrate:</hi> But the <hi>Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer</hi>
follows <hi>This</hi> too, by Falling in with the Author of the
<hi>Apology</hi> before Cited upon this very Text.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[We shall Conclude the</hi> Whole (says he) <hi>With
what is said by a</hi> Moderate French Writer,<note place="margin">Consid.</note>

before,</hi> viz. [I would to God that Those of the Church
of Rome had the same Tenderness for Vs, that we have
for Them; And that they would but Treat Vs with
the like Openness, and Candor; They would be then
Easily satisfi'd, that we are no Enemies of a <hi>Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation,</hi>
if they would but take a step or two on
their side to Meet us upon the way.] <hi>But this can never
be,</hi> so long as the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> pretends, not only
to be the Chief of the Order, but to Exercise an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary,
and Absolute Power, as a <hi>Monarch</hi> in the
<hi>Church]</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And so he goes on, Reckoning up a great
many Errors in the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>as</hi> Obstructions <hi>to a</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation;
<hi>coming to this</hi> Result <hi>at Last. [So long I say,
as These</hi> and the Other like Abuses shall be Continued
in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> People may make what Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
they please: But there is no Vnion to be Expected
betwixt Them and Vs.] <hi>So that strike off the</hi> Abuses,
<hi>and the</hi> Obstacle <hi>is</hi> Removed.</p>
               <p>Now whatever <hi>Misunderstandings</hi> have fall'n out upon the
way,<note place="margin">Notes.</note> I cannot see, but that the <hi>Considerer,</hi> the <hi>Apologist,</hi> and
the <hi>Observator,</hi> are all Three of the same Mind upon the
Pinch of this Question, which is, that Men <hi>Continuing</hi> in
<hi>Erroneous Oppositions</hi> upon the Subject of <hi>Religion,</hi> cannot
<hi>Agree</hi> in the <hi>Truth;</hi> And that without the <hi>Truth,</hi> There can
be No <hi>Agreement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is Another Touch upon the <hi>Observator</hi> about the
<hi>Prerogative</hi> of the <hi>Deposing-Power.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Consid.</note> [It is so far <hi>(says the</hi>
Considerer) from being True, that <hi>[Not one Papist
in a Thousand is of the Persuasion that Princes may
be Deposed,</hi> Obs. Vol. 3. N. 6.] That more Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably,
not one in a Thousand is against it; and
if any such be against it, it is with as much <hi>Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence</hi>
to the Principles of <hi>Their</hi> Church, as it is

that the</hi> Papists <hi>are not</hi> Agreed <hi>whether the</hi> Infallibility <hi>be
Lodg'd in the</hi> Church Diffusive <hi>or not; or</hi> Where <hi>it is Lodg'd;
And this Instance was us'd, to shew that in</hi> That Point, the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi>
of the Papists are not <hi>Known</hi> and <hi>Certain: And if so; this</hi>
Inference <hi>will never hold, upon the</hi> Universality <hi>of that</hi> Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
<hi>Nay He Himself gives an Instance even against Himself,
in the same Page,</hi> where he Acknowledges, the Clergy of <hi>France</hi>
did not long since Publish a Proposition: [That the Pope had no
Power in Civil and Temporal Affairs, and that Kings were
Subject to no Ecclesiastical Power, nor can be Deposed, nor their
Subjects be Absolved from their Allegiance.] <hi>So that here's a
Foul Gap in the</hi> Principle <hi>already, to say nothing of our late
Experiences; For it is</hi> not <hi>my</hi> Zeal <hi>for the</hi> Papists, <hi>but the</hi>
Veneration <hi>that I have for</hi> Truth, Honesty, <hi>and</hi> Common Iustice,
<hi>that has engag'd me in this Controversie; not forgetting what
I owe to my self all this while, in the</hi> Common Cause.</p>
               <p>To summ up the Whole now in a Few Words; The Sun

The <hi>Connexion Mangled,</hi> and <hi>Disjointed;</hi> My <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,</hi>

the several Parts of the <hi>Calumny,</hi> the Entire <hi>Structure</hi> falls
to <hi>pieces.</hi> I will, in Charity, Believe, that the <hi>Considerer</hi>
took his <hi>Citations</hi> upon <hi>Trust,</hi> Especially, in what Concerns
the <hi>Address</hi> of the <hi>Reverend Clergy of the City of London:</hi>
For the <hi>Phrase</hi> in <hi>General</hi> of <hi>Our Religion;</hi> The <hi>Protestant
Religion;</hi> The <hi>Reformed <hi>Religion,</hi>

Appropriated</hi> to the <hi>Protestant <hi>Dissenters,</hi>
                  </hi> that it will
not so much as bear an <hi>Allusion</hi> to Any thing else; And I
thought it very Reasonable, to Inculcate a <hi>Caution</hi> against
Those <hi>Ambiguities,</hi> that have been so Pernicious to the <hi>Crown,</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Obs.</hi> Why you are <hi>Out</hi> now, <hi>Several Ways. First;</hi> it is
<hi>Not</hi> That <hi>Liberty</hi> of a mans Serving God according to his
<hi>Iudgment:</hi> For you <hi>Challenge</hi> That to the <hi>Subject,</hi> which
you <hi>Deny</hi> to the <hi>Magistrate: <hi>His</hi> Conscience</hi> bids him <hi>Serve
God,</hi> in <hi>Order;</hi> the <hi>People</hi> will have <hi>Their <hi>Consciences</hi>
                  </hi> at
<hi>Liberty</hi> to serve him in <hi>Confusion.</hi> The <hi>Magistrate</hi>'s is a <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning
Conscience:</hi> And what's to be <hi>done</hi> now, if the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject's
Consciences</hi> shall Refuse to be <hi>Govern'd?</hi> The <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate's
Conscience</hi> is Answerable for the whole <hi>Community:</hi>
The <hi>Subject</hi>'s is a <hi>Private Case,</hi> where every <hi>Individual</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
only for his <hi>Single Self. <hi>The Magistrate Sins against
his</hi> Own <hi>Conscience if he</hi> Suffers</hi> a <hi>Capricious</hi> part of his <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi>
to run <hi>Vagabonding,</hi> and <hi>Schismatizing,</hi> according to
<hi>Theirs:</hi> Besides that the <hi>Wisdom of God,</hi> and the <hi>Disposition</hi> of
<hi>Divine Providence,</hi> have made the <hi>Prince</hi> the <hi>Iudge</hi> of the
<hi>Controversy;</hi> and <hi>His <hi>Conscience</hi>
                  </hi> Exerts it self in <hi>Authority,</hi>
while the <hi>Peoples <hi>Consciences</hi>
                  </hi> are to <hi>Acquiesce,</hi> either in <hi>Resig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi>
or <hi>Obedience:</hi> The <hi>People</hi> are <hi>All</hi> and <hi>Every Man</hi> of
'em the <hi>Kings Subjects:</hi> And besides the <hi>Impious Mixture</hi> of
<hi>Erroneous,</hi> and <hi>Contradictory Opinions;</hi> All their Pretended
<hi>Associations <hi>of Conscience,</hi>
                  </hi> are <hi>Conspiracies</hi> of <hi>Practice;</hi> when,
at the Same time, the <hi>Sovereign</hi> has the <hi>Ordinance</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> the
<hi>Laws</hi> of the <hi>Land; Piety, Duty, Imperial Prerogative,</hi> and
<hi>Reason of State,</hi> on his side: So that there's a <hi>Conscience <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensable,</hi>
                  </hi>
on the <hi>One</hi> Hand, and a <hi>Conscience <hi>Unwarrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi>
                  </hi>
on the <hi>Other:</hi> Insomuch that <hi>Liberty of Conscience</hi> makes
against ye All the ways you can put it: For it is against <hi>Law;</hi>
Against <hi>Right;</hi> Against <hi>Truth, Nature,</hi> and <hi>Religion:</hi> And,
like a <hi>Bottomless Quick-Sand,</hi> it Sucks-in the very <hi>Frame</hi> of
All <hi>Political Constitutions, <hi>Never</hi>
                  </hi> to be <hi>Retriv'd.</hi> It is <hi>Your
Liberty of Conscience</hi> that I speak of; But the <hi>Magistrate's
Right,</hi> and <hi>Obligation</hi> of <hi>Conscience</hi> stands as <hi>Firm</hi> as the <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations</hi>
of the <hi>Earth.</hi> And prethee wilt thou go now, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
all the <hi>Rabbi</hi>'s of the <hi>Separation, Casuistically,</hi> upon <hi>This
Point.</hi> What <hi>Dispensation</hi> from <hi>Almighty God,</hi> has a <hi>King,</hi>
more then a <hi>Subject,</hi> to Act <hi>Contrary</hi> to his <hi>Conscience?</hi> Or
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:107112:20"/>
what <hi>Answer</hi> shall That <hi>Prince</hi> make, at the Day of <hi>Iudgment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
That when his <hi>Conscience</hi> Charges him, (as he hopes for <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation)</hi>
to Provide, according to the Best of his <hi>Skill,</hi> for the
<hi>Welfare</hi> of his <hi>People,</hi> shall yet Suffer his <hi>Subjects</hi> to Exercise
That <hi>License,</hi> which He in his <hi>Conscience, Thinks, Iudges,</hi> and
<hi>Believes,</hi> will be for their <hi>Destruction?</hi> The Question is, First;
<hi>Whether or No shall This Prince Govern <hi>according to his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science?</hi>
2ly,</hi> How is it <hi>possible,</hi> to <hi>Reconcile</hi> This <hi>Popular
Liberty,</hi> to a <hi>Consistency</hi> with the <hi>Conscience</hi> of the <hi>Supreme
Magistrate,</hi> and the <hi>Necessary Regulations</hi> of <hi>Sovereign Power?
3ly,</hi> Which shall have the <hi>Preference,</hi> in This Case, the <hi>Kings
Conscience,</hi> or the <hi>Peoples?</hi> That is to say, in Few Words;
where's the <hi>Sovereignty?</hi> In the <hi>King,</hi> or in the <hi>Multitude?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And again, [The <hi>Supream Magistrate</hi> has a <hi>Double Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,<note place="margin">Obs. Num. 36. Vol. 3.</note>

                  <note place="margin">Obs. Num. 42. Vol. 3.</note> Obs. Num. 36 Vol. 3.] What is this
to say now but that <hi>his <hi>Religious</hi> Conscience</hi> is <hi>Free</hi> as he is a
<hi>Christian,</hi> But <hi>his <hi>Practical</hi> Conscience</hi> is <hi>Limited <hi>as he is a</hi>

               </p>
               <p>What is there more now, in All This, then that <hi>Kings are

Throats,</hi> which they will most <hi>Certainly</hi> do, and <hi>Destroy</hi>
their <hi>Sovereign</hi> over and above, when ever he <hi>Yields</hi> to them
the Point of <hi>Popular Liberty of Conscience?</hi> So that here
are <hi>Reasons of State, Sublimated</hi> into <hi>Articles of Faith;</hi> and a

Acquitted me to all Purposes upon the whole matter: But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
the <hi>Rumour</hi> was <hi>Supported</hi> as long as they could keep
<hi>Life</hi> in't; and it was <hi>Impossible</hi> for any Man to <hi>Believe that
