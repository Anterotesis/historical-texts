            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Author of this Poem, knowing how hardly the best things protect themselves from censure, had no ambition to make it this way publique.

Nor estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming otherwise of them, whose abilities in this kinde are most passable, then of Masquers, who spangle, &amp; glitter for the time, but tis through tinsell. As it was meerly out of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience that he first wrote it, so when it was made, had it not been commanded from him, it had died upon the place, where it took life. Himselfe being so averse from raysing fame from the stage, that at the prefentment, he was one of the severest spectators there; nor ever show'd other signe whereby it might be knowne to be his, but his liberty to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise it. Yet he hath at length consented it should passe the Presse; not with an Ayme to purchase a new Reputation, but to keep that which he hath already from growing worse. For understanding that some at <hi>London,</hi> without his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation or allowance, were ready to print a false, imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Coppy, he was loth to be libell'd by his owne worke; or that his Play should appeare to the world with more then its own faults. <hi>Farewell.</hi>

            <l>THE Author, Royall Sir, so dreads this Night,</l>
            <l>As if for writing he were doomd to th'sight.</l>
            <l>Or else, unlesse you doe protect his fame,</l>
            <l>Y' had sav'd his Play, and sentenc'd him to th' flame.</l>
            <l>For though your name, or power, were ith'reprive,</l>
            <l>Such workes, he thinks, are but condemn'd to live.</l>
            <l>Which, for this place being rescued from the fire,</l>
            <l>Take ruine from th'advancement, and fall higher.</l>
            <l>Though None, he hopes, sit here upon his wit,</l>
            <l>As if he Poems did, or Playes commit.</l>
            <l>Yet he must needs feare censure, that feares prayse,</l>
            <l>Nor would write still wer't to succeed ith' Bayes.</l>
            <l>For he is not oth' trade, nor would excell</l>
            <l>In this kinde, where tis lightnesse to doe well.</l>
            <l>Yet as the Gods refin'd base things, and some</l>

            <l>And as the Oxe prepar'd, and crowned Bull</l>

            <l>Perchance he'd beg you would be good to th' Play.</l>
            <l>And I, to set him up in Reputation,</l>
            <l>Should hold a Bason forth for Approbation.</l>
            <l>But praise so gain'd, He thinks, were a Reliefe</l>
            <l>Able to make his Comoedy a Briefe.</l>
            <l>For where your pitty must your judgement be,</l>
            <l>Tis not a Play, but you fir'd houses see.</l>
            <l>Look not his quill, then, should petitions run;</l>

            <l>Whither their sold Scenes be dislikt, or hit,</l>

            <l>An Empty second day, or a thinne share;</l>
            <l>But can make th' Actors, though you come not twice,</l>
