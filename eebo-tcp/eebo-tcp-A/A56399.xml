            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
Reverend and most Ingenious
Mr. Jeremy Collier.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>BY many Titles you claim
my poor Endeavours, but
by none more than that of
the Example you have given me;
on which account, how much soever
the World is oblig'd to you, I,
for my part, must acknowledge
my self more especially indebt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
since of our Moderns, none
<pb facs="tcp:94057:3"/>
has afforded me a more perfect
Idea of Genuine Eloquence and
Reason than Mr. <hi>Collier.</hi> Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
therefore receive a Creature
thus in an inferiour Sense your
own; encourage its Address, and
protect it from the Censures and
Criticisms of a squeamish Age:
Protect it, I beseech you, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
under so great Disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages,
as its Author's Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity,
the Impediments of his
present Circumstances, and the
burden of its own Defects; Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacles
that must have prov'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>superable,
but for the benign In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
and Condescensions of that
Learned President and Society
under whose Discipline I live,
and by whose Instructions and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
I endeavour to improve.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:94057:3"/>
Instead of troubling you with
any occasions of my ensuing Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances,
I shall only inform
you of the occasion of a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Omission, I mean my neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of Mathematical Arguments,
of which the World is become most
immoderately fond, looking upon
every thing as trivial, that bears
no relation to the Compasses, and
establishing the most distant parts
of Humane Knowledge; all Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations,
whether Physical, Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical,
Ethical, Political, or any
other upon the particular results
of Number and Magnitude. Nor
is it to be question'd, but the
Dominion of Number and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude
is very large. Must they
therefore devour all Relations and
Properties whatsoever? 'Tis plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
unreasonable. In any other
Common-wealth but that of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb facs="tcp:94057:4"/>
such attempts towards an
absolute Monarchy would quick<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
meet with Opposition. It may
be a kind of Treason, perhaps,
to intimate thus much; but who
can any longer forbear, when he
sees the most noble, and most use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
portions of Philosophy lie
fallow and deserted for oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
of learning how <hi>to prove
the Whole bigger than the
Part,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I expect also some Doctrines
of that Essay, which treats of the
Certainty of Things, and the De<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>monstration
of a Deity, will be
disrelish'd by a Party of Men
amongst us at this time not incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable.
But the Author assures
all such, that as he understands
his Inferences in that Essay to be
just and sure, however agreeable
<pb facs="tcp:94057:4"/>
to this or that Hypothesis, so he
has neither taken advantage of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Errors, nor <hi>from</hi> any Acquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Mr. <hi>Lock,</hi> having not
read that Gentleman's elegant Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say
of <hi>Humane Understanding,</hi> till
some time after he had compos'd his
own Discourse, wherein he resolv'd
to quit all Authority for the simple
Evidence of his own naked Reason.</p>
            <p>And here I cannot chuse, but hint,
how much it were to be wish'd, your
self, Sir, would put an end to the
Dispute now prosecuted by that
Gentleman. I am confident a Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
so penetrating, adorn'd with
a Rhetorick so powerfull, might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
decide that subtile Controversie
both to the satisfaction of the Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonists
and their Readers. But, I
confess, I cannot handsomely urge
this mòtion, when I recollect how
<pb facs="tcp:94057:5"/>
vast a design you are already form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
a design which will redound
as much to the Credit of your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
as did once the <hi>Athenian</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns,
the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Pyramids, or
the <hi>Roman</hi> Registers to the Glory
of those States, and from the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit
of which, to detain you longer,
were altogether unpardonable in,</p>

               <p>GOOD morrow, Sir, You look

            <sp>
               <speaker>Bur.</speaker>
               <p>And so, <hi>Philalethes,</hi> would I always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly,
for such a surfeit of pleasures as I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd

            </sp>

               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>Dry, Sober, and Philosophical ones,
I suppose; for a little of any other serves your
turn.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bur.</speaker>
               <p>Philosophical if you please, but not dry.
O thou prodigious, incomparable, divine <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net!</hi>
thou foiler of all Philosophers, High-Priest
of Nature!</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, if you're there-abouts, I ask no
more Questions, but should be glad if you could
govern your self so far as but to learn my Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions
against your <hi>Night-mare.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bur.</speaker>
               <p>Prescriptions! I hope you will not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
to do more than so many eminent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicians
and Vertuoso's have done yet. The
sortress you would beleaguer is altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable;
and let the fate of others teach you,
that whosoever attempts the Theory, had as
good strike at a Spirit.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>However, with your permission, I will
venture the consequences, but shall premise this
in your favour, that I think all Characterizings
and personal Representations ought to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
avoided in the dispute. I'm sure that will
never confute a mistake, how much soever it
may lessen the Lapser. Nor will I remind you
of any thing hitherto urg'd by the Learned and
Ingenious against your Theory; only give me
leave to communicate a thought or two of my
own, and be free to find what flaws you can.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bur.</speaker>
               <p>Very fairly proposed, and you shall be
as fairly heard.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>I thank you. Then know in the first
place, it has been my opinion all along, that
the work might be cut much shorter. I was
never a Friend to multiplying Problems and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94057:6"/>
Propositions. The Theory is from first to last
a plausible pretty Chain of Physical Effects,
wherein you need ruin but one link to ruin the
whole. Make but one breach, and your impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnable
Fortress is lost. Compasses and Slate
may as well hang in their places, for a little
good Logick and natural Philosophy are suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to make head against the Mischief. Yet
because the surest way is to strike at the root, I
shall examine your Theorist's foundation, and
presume if he be catch'd tripping there, you
will easily give up his After-conclusions.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bur.</speaker>
               <p>You may depend upon't.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>Very good. Then if I make it appear
that the form of the Ante diluvian Earth was
not different from the form of the present Earth,
you will no longer maintain that the Deluge
was brought to pass by the Dissolution of any
form of the Earth different from the present.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bur.</speaker>
               <p>No longer I promise you; but yet I
shall be at a loss for any better Hypothesis to
clear those difficulties, which otherwise the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of an Universal Flood must necessarily carry
with it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>As for that, further Speculations may
in time bring forth a satisfactory Hypothesis:
but if they should not, thus much we know, That
the Flood was either the ordinary Effect of second
Causes, though the measures of their Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
be hidden from us, or if it could not be such
an Effect, that it was the direct and immediate

               <p>The Theorist you know presumes it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly
certain, that the Earth rose out of a
Chaos at first, and that such a Chaos as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
describes <hi>(Theor. Book 1. Chap. 4.)</hi> a fluid
Mass, or a Mass of all sorts of little Parts and
Particles of Matter mix'd together and floating
in confusion one with another. And this Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
he lays down as a Postulate, whereas I
must tell you, it ought to have been offer'd with
such restrictions as render it wholly unservicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to his main design. For why must this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>os
be a fluid Mass? Why might it not be as
well a drift or shower of Atoms yet unamass'd,
disorderly dancing one amongst another, and at
various distances?</p>

               <p>God forbid using of <hi>Epicurus</hi>'s terms

to thus much. That the Chaos or mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Elements of our Earth which were origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
created by a Divine Power, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
by the same Divine Power so dispos'd and
compounded as to form this Sublunary World,
might as well be a Company or Chorus of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms
of divers kinds dispers'd and dancing in the

               <p>What becomes then of the Authority
of the Ancients? who (not to cite'em particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly)
understood by their Chaos nothing but a

Mixture or Collection of the several Seeds

in my opinion none at all (sacred Authority al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
excepted whereto my Hypothesis is not
that I know of any way repugnant) for if the
Tradition of the Ancients avails any thing in
the present case, it therefore avails because they
liv'd at a less distance of time from the Chaos:
but alas! neither their earliness, nor the credit
of their Tradition qualifie 'em to be better
Judges than we of what neither they nor their
Fore-fathers could know more than the latest
of their Posterity: and 'tis impossible they
should be better acquainted with the Chaos than
their Offspring, unless they and the Chaos had
been Cotemporary. Not to mention how much
they are indebted to <hi>Moses</hi> for their Notions,
as also that most of your Authorities are either
properly Poetical, or else pure Hypothesis, and
Theory like your own.</p>

give a better guess from the Contemplation of

a good Comment upon Disorder: for
whether your Chaos or mine were the true,

No doubt they were equally Strangers

the distribution of the Chaos, much more
about the state of it before that distribution. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did the righteous Man and his Family, that
we know of, make any remarks at the time of
the Deluge which might give us some light into
the matter, or granting they left a Tradition
behind them relating thereto, and lost many
Ages ago, which however there appears no
manner of reason why we should grant, still I
say those remarks must be very imperfect, and
contribute little enough to our knowledge of the
Distribution of the Chaos, nothing at all to our
knowledge of its Constitution before that Distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution

to you that unless your dancing Atoms will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
all the ends of our fluid mass, I shall hold
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94057:8"/>
it reasonable to pay some deference to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Ancients which at least confirms
the original state of Nature to be such as is fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <p>With all my heart, when you can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
a just cause why my dancing Atoms as
soon as they are gather'd into a body will not
serve the true genuine purposes of a Chaos as

            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>Of singular use, believe me; for the
Atoms or Particles of my Chaos being free and
separate, and not sorted into distinct Orders and
Species, nor allotted their proper distances from
each other, 'tis very probable many less Detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of them would unite distinctly from any
greater Combination, and being united into
such smaller Masses, would in time encounter
the larger Combination (such an one as we may
understand to consist of the grossest matter of all
being the likeliest to reach the Center soonest)
and by their accession render the Superficies of
it however Spherical and regular in it self (which
according to our Supposition it could scarce be
to a Nicety) very uneven and mountainous. All
this would be but a natural result, and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
a more immediate Interposition of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
to frame the great ball of our Earth so
regular as it now appears to be; as indeed all
Events in the natural World do, and ever did,
and the Deluge no less than the rest, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the large Province you would assign to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94057:9"/>
second Causes. Thus we see what a doughty
Postulate your Theory leans upon.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Bur.</speaker>
               <p>Still we stand both upon the same bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
and if I should assent to your Hypothesis
you cannot, I think, deny but you have as much
reason to assent to mine. Only this advantage
I retain above you, that those Conclusions which
the Theory infers afterwards from my Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis,
are so just and apposite, and otherwise so
perfectly inexplicable as to turn the Scale on my
side, and strengthen not a little the probability
of our Proposition.</p>

               <p>As for the inexplicableness of those
Conclusions, I have spoke to it already, and
need only admonish you to beware of such circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar

               <p>To no worse a Friend than your self.
The Flood came to pass by the disruption of
that Crust of Earth which inclos'd the Abyss.
How could that be, unless there was such a
Crust? But there was such a Crust form'd
when the Chaos was digested into Order. Why
do you believe so? because the Floud which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued
upon the dis-ruption of this Crust is best
accounted for upon such a supposal. And yet
bating this Argument, I do not see but my Scheme
deserves to be as fairly receiv'd as that of
the Theorist, <hi>consideratis considerandis.</hi> But I
am ready to quit my own Notion of the Chaos,
offer'd only to shew the precariousness of the
Theorist's, and supposing the state of the <hi>Tohu
bohu</hi> to have been such as he describes it, I hope
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94057:9"/>
in the next place to convince you that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution
of its parts could not be such as he
would have it, not that Incrustation, upon
which he builds so confidently, be effected after
such a manner as he imagines.</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>You may remember the Theorist ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
delineated his Chaos, presently after, takes
notice that from such a Chaos 'tis impossible
should arise a mountainous, uneven Earth, for
that no Concretion or consistent State which
this Mass could flow into immediately, or first
settle in, could be of such a form or figure as
our present Earth, neither without nor within;
not within, because there the Earth is full of Cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and empty Places, of Dens and broken Holes,
whereof some are open to the Air, and others
cover'd and enclos'd wholly within the ground.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bur.</speaker>
               <p>And pray are not both of these unimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
in any liquid Substance, whose parts will
necessarily flow together into one continued Mass,
and cannot be divided into Apartments and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
Rooms, nor have Vaults or Caverns made
within it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>Not at all unimitable, if I may be a
Judge, for let us but conceive the agitation of
the Parts of this liquid Chaos to be pretty quick
and violent, which why it should not I know of
no better reasons you can give than I can why it
should; I say, suppose their agitation somewhat
of the quickest, and your Theorist's Axiom will
appear a plain mistake, unless he will please to
exempt some of the main constituent Principles
of this sublunary World out of his Chaos.</p>

               <p>I cannot apprehend what you would
drive at no more than why you should doubt of
the comprehensiveness of our Chaos. I know
no reason why we ought to exclude either Fire,
or Air, or Earth, or Water, I mean the consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuent
parts of them, and if you will consult the
Theorist's own description of his Chaos <hi>(Book

mind.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>I am glad to hear it; I was almost a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
the two former Elements would get no
House-room, at least that commodious Utensil,
Fire; and the more, because in that same De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of his which you cite, he has forgot to
reckon it amongst his principles of all Terrestrial
(I suppose by that word he means sublunary)
Bodies.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bur.</speaker>
               <p>But do not you know the Theorist is
so liberal of that Element, as to furnish out of
the Centre with it even to profuseness?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>With just as good a pretence as Mr.
<hi>Hobbs</hi> himself has sometimes acknowledged such
a thing as a Law of Nature, but yet by the
constant Tenour of his Argumentations would
abolish the very meaning of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thus the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orist
tolerates a Central Fire, and at the same
time forgets how upon the secretion of his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>os
he tumbles down all the course miry rubbish
directly thither. But this only by the by: so
long as he is reconcil'd to any mixture of Igne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and Aethereal Particles I am content, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the consequence runs thus, That these Igne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and Aethereal Particles being driven, and
put into motion in common with the rest may
not unlikely occasion rarefactions, at least in
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94057:10"/>
concurrence with the sulphureous Particles.
This I presume may pass with you for a Result
natural enough.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Bur.</speaker>
               <p>Not so very natural neither, 'till you
can make out the necessity of your quick and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent
motion. Did you never see Water and
Ashes mixt in a Kettle before 'twas hung over
the Fire? if you ever did, I much question
whether you could find a motion so brisk among
the parts of that Liquid, as to cause rarefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>Pardon me, Sir, if I think the case
quite different in the Chaos, not only because
its parts are suppos'd to be ten Thousand de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
more minute and mobile with respect to
each other than the gross ones of common Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and Ashes, but also because in such a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
before 'tis hung over the Fire, there
are no such ingredients as igneous Particles, nor
yet any sulphureous, at least at liberty. But up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the insinuations of the igneous Particles you
may behold how the more subtle parts of the
mixture are easily rarefy'd, and the gross ones
crowded one upon another. In like manner I
cannot but believe the grosser and earthy parts of
the Chaos by the rarefaction of the Igneous and
Aethereal would gather into Cakes and Masses
around the Spheres of rarefaction, which if pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticable,
then might the interior parts of the
Chaos be divided into Apartments and separate
Rooms, and have Vaults and Caverns made
within it, for the Masses so form'd being une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual,
irregular and disjointed, either of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
or by Explosions, when the rarefaction is
violent and restrain'd, encounter and tumble up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94057:11"/>
one another, by that means falling into
greater Masses, and those greater Masses being
craggy and cliffy, and settling among one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
no less irregularly, must necessarily leave
within them those Vaults and Caverns, so little
expected by the Theorist.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Bur.</speaker>
               <p>Very good. Then it seems you fancy

               <p>Not so fast, my Friend. But this I i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine
that what an overproportion'd degree of

in a Mess of Frumenty, <hi>viz.</hi> The clotting
or coalition of the grosser parts, that would a
degree of heat proportionably less very natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
effect in the Chaos. Nor do I think it can
be doubted but a Concourse of principles, so
contrary, will beget Fermentations, and by those
Fermentations the more feculent parts must
needs be separated from the finer and lighter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Masses of various Bulk and Figure, which if
granted upon your Theorist's own terms his Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis
unavoidably perishes.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
               <p>Why if the grosser parts must be colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
into Masses before the Descent of any of
them towards the Centre, as the case will stand
if they were collected by and during the Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
then will they upon their Descent lodge
themselves so immethodically one upon another,
and ruinously, as both to form Hills and Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencies
on their Surface, and leave hollownesses
within their Substance, and so the Primaeval
Earth will be e'ery whit as ill shap'd as that we
poor Mortals inhabit, even in spight of the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orist's
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94057:11"/>
lucky invention. Nay further, I see no
reason why, if we should excuse all Fermentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
whatsoever, the grosser Particles should not
either in their common state of Fluidity, or in
descending, gather into such Masses of different
Form and Size, according as larger or less num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of 'em encounter'd, and according as their
postures and modifications differ'd which circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
as they must be very various and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
in a Mass so compounded as the Chaos, and
withall so disorderly in the motions of its parts,
so they cannot but be the cause of horrible irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities
and deformities both upon and within
the great collection of the pond'rous solid parts.

               <p>How unwarrantably he compass'd all
that we shall presently evince. In the mean
while I would gladly be inform'd why oleagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
Particles meeting with earthy and gross
in a common Fluid may not couple and hold
them together very tightly and effectually, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if it be consider'd that it is the property
of Oily Particles to concorporate when they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter,
and consequently that by their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations
they become so much the better capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to collect and retain such dispers'd Particles
of Earth as come in their way. But this
is certain, that during its state of Fluidity the
Oily Parts of the Chaos when earthy occurr to
them, must adhere pertinaciously to the earthy,
so that in the distribution of the Chaos they
cannot disengage themselves, but are oblig'd to
subside along with them, and what will you do
now for a Sphere of Oil a' top of your Water,
when the parts of your Chaos are to be digested
into order? Yet without it you must utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair
of a Crust, and without a Crust, of an u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal
Deluge occasion'd by the disruption and

with a Dispute which indeed the Theorist him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self

of me, for if for confirmation he so willingly
appeals (as he often does most willingly) to the

            <head>That Wit and Beauty are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
the Concomitants of
Vertue.</head>
            <p>IT has always surpass'd the skill of our Wits
to define their own Excellency. What
Mr. <hi>Cowley</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiev'd
in the Undertaking is perhaps bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
known and (if I may dare to say so) less
considerable than to challenge the mentioning at
present. It seems to be altogether as intimate
an affection as even simple Perceptions either of
Understanding or Sense, and though very clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
known to it self, yet never can shine out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
its head. I confess that numerous party
of Mankind, who are no more than qualified to
listen and admire, may command a faint Idea of
it. They know there is something tickles in
such a certain choice and order of words, but
how the Pleasure is first form'd, and by what art
insinuated, they apprehend but very imperfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Nor does the Vanity of the Polytheism of
the Ancients appear to me more surprizing and
extravagant than their founding a whole College
of Gods and Goddesses for the Super-intendency
of Wit, seems (with respect to Polytheists)
consistent and reasonable. For besides its strange
variety of Feature, and the force of its Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
the manner of its presenting it self resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:94057:13"/>
not a little a divine Impulse: it darts in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Imagination unpremeditated, and often
violently. Its motions are rapid, and so capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
its embrace, that the farthest points of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
lie within its clasp, and every thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
'em dances after its pleasure like a Puppet
to the strings. It amuses the Understanding and
checks it in the Carreer of a sound or false rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning.
How often has the Poinancy of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
proposition, or the quaintness of a reply de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd
Life and Death? No more than O!
<hi>Solon, Solon,</hi> rescued a Monarch almost in the
very article of Fate, and snatch'd him from the
Pile already kindled, to the embrace and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the Victor. King <hi>Athelstan</hi>'s Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearer,
at whose instigation amongst others, that
Prince had some years before murther'd his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
at length became the instrument of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Vengeance against himself, and that by a
pure <hi>Lapsus Linguae,</hi> for chancing to slip one
day when he reach'd the Ewer, but recovering
himself on the other Leg, <hi>that's as it should be,</hi>
cry'd he, designing only to out-jeer the miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
<hi>one Brother helps t'other;</hi> but the words,
it seems, made a far different impression upon
the King, and easily admonish'd his conscience
to do justice upon the person that utter'd 'em.
Kingdoms and States have sometimes been trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
by an Elegancy. Almost a Troop in
season has taken Towns, and routed Armies.
Now so singular a Privilege as this 'tis certain
it most especially concerns the great Distributer
to conferr <hi>critically.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where Events of such consequence depend
upon it, both his Justice and Omniscience en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94057:14"/>
him to exactness. Were it a light ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
concern, he might sometimes seemingly
recede from the direction of the Plummet, and
by an After-decree correct the deviation: But
true Wit is a gratuity too valuable to be put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the hands of those who are ready and resolv'd
to pervert it when conferr'd to the worst pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses.
Like the sweetest and most volatile Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes
it becomes by abuse most offensive and
pernicious, and diffuses as wide, if not wider
than before. Yet this reasoning will by no
means hold universally. Exceptions present
themselves too frequently for such a compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensiveness,
and no where to our shame more
frequently than at home, even to such a pass,
that Dissoluteness and Irreligion are made the
Livery of Wit, and no body must be conscious
of good parts, but he loses the credit of them
unless he take care to finish 'em with Immorali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
However, as much as these Examples
crowd in upon us, there is this yet to be said,
that the gloss is too slight to hold. They may
ring the changes a while upon words, but the
sense and the sound expire together, and the
Organ of hearing is no sooner compos'd again,
but the minds of the Audience recollect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and nauseate the emptiness of the Quib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
I dare say, no body ever yet read the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scenities
of my Lord <hi>Rochester,</hi> or the <hi>Omnis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim
per se</hi> of <hi>Lucretius,</hi> but upon cooling saw
the Cheat, and grew, at least in his heart, out of
Love with it. Dactyl and Spondee cannot take
fast hold enough. The murmurs of a Cascade
may lull us in a Grotto, but when we are once
come abroad, any reliques of the noise in our
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94057:14"/>
ears serve only to disturb us. So that what Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
might have prevented in the Cause, it
has utterly defeated in the Effect, and our Beau|'sprits
must think of giving warning to their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiousness,
and listing under Vertue, if esteem
is their Scope. Indeed the conditions of their
Depravity are such that the Habit endangers
the Faculty. There is so much of the Absurd
in all irreligious Notions, as is even apt to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
and confound the fancy, or however re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
its pittance of Elegancies to <hi>Oxymoron</hi>
and <hi>Hysteron-Proteron.</hi> A civil War presently
breaks forth between the Judgment and Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
the former will be continually bearing
down upon the latter, continually bearing
down upon the latter, continuall mortifying
its pertness, and disappointing its motions. But
then if Intemperance goes hand in hand with
Prophaneness, 'tis a desperate case. For Wit
is no more proof against the Fumes of Luxury
and Indigestion, than a Feather against Smoak;
in spite of Fate they waft it all away, and 'tis
out of reach before you think on't:
<q>
                  <l>Quin Corpus onustum</l>
                  <l>Hesternis vitiis animum quoque praegravat u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nà,</l>
                  <l>Atque affigit humo divinae particulam aurae.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Some Genius's, 'tis true, retain their alacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
longer than others. Some can hold out a
<hi>Trojan</hi> Siege; others perhaps scarce a twenty-years
course of Bestiality shall effectually reduce,
and there are of a third sort that are almost ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
to one Bottle extraordinary. Nay I
have generally observ'd, that the more refin'd
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:94057:15"/>
the Genius, the more suddenly extinguish'd.
Many acute Persons instead of being elevated,
find themselves rather doz'd by the operation of
Wine. Many again grow <hi>Bacchanals</hi> in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
and had need only clap spurs to their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination
to make it run away with them. A
few tempers 'tis confess'd are Masters of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium;
but none always. Assiduity in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
will effect at long run what <hi>Circe</hi> compass'd
with a single Charm. 'Tis recorded of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
the <hi>Macedon,</hi> that he was a man of Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem
and singular Acuteness, and the progress
of his Arms declares him no worse a Politician
than Commander, but when for some time he
had abandon'd himself to Sensuality and Supine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
he not only lessen'd his Authority amongst
his Soldiers, but soon became guilty of the gros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest
follies 'twas possible for him to commit, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying
his best Friends, burning his own Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
crowning his own Captives, insomuch that
had he liv'd a few years longer, instead of weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for want of a world to conquer, he might
have whimper'd for the loss of that he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd
already. And much better it is, never
to have had, than at length to have forfeited an
eminency of Understanding. He who was born
with common Intellects, neither knows the
worth of Wit, nor the want of it. He 'scapes
all notice, and takes none. He values no Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
like that of a downright Dealer, and
prefers a Shop Beesom to the Bays. Whereas
he that makes Ship-wrack of his Talent meets
with a Destiny much severer; he carries his
Ignominy in his forehead, and sinks from a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Jests into the matter of 'em. There's
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:94057:15"/>
not half the inconvenience in being beggar'd or
cashier'd. They are misfortunes common to
the Wit with the Blockhead, and where cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
and conditions do or may jump, the
multitude behave themselves towards a sufferer
the more candidly for their own sakes. But
they never have any mercy for him whose losses
are foreign to all of their own Capacity, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if he has brought the Calamity upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and that by methods only befitting them.
This they think a just occasion for Triumph,
and therefore insult without measure upon such
a Proselyte to Stupidity. <q>D'you see that
poor Dog there? (cry the Journey-men and
Prentices as you walk the Street) since I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
him, he was a modest, sober, gentile,
pretty Gentleman, and moreover a man of as
clear a head, and as clever a Tongue as any
within forty Miles of him, 'till we got him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our Club, fox'd him ev'ry bout for a Twelve-month
together, and now we've drunk the
Bastard out of his Wits, we are e'en resolv'd
to drink him out of all his Money too,
and then turn him over to the Boys and the
Bailiffs.</q> Besides, no Wit is so lively as that
which is accompanied with a Complacency and
Lustre of mind. Their Bosom-Monitor will
be troublesome to Rakes of Railery. Remorse
never fails to balk all their good things. Good
Wits, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> has observ'd, and before
him <hi>Aristotle,</hi> are the most subject to Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
of any people in the World, but loose
ones lie under a double <hi>Shagrin,</hi> and till they
reform, are like to play their parts but very
awkardly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:94057:16"/>
The same is to be said of Beauty as of Wit:
all the difference is, The one engages by the Ear,
the other by the Eye. But Beauty is a charm
of a more universal sway. A fourth part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
I believe I may safely say, are, if not ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Strangers to the notion of Wit, yet little
affected with the Gallantry of it. And in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
those who are without it themselves, are
apt secretly to envy their Neighbours too much
to be generously and heartily delighted with it.
But in Beauty the case is far otherwise. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of that seems acquir'd; and we may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
without reproaching our selves that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
in another which is perfectly fatal to him.
Not that I think Wit altogether an acquir'd
Excellency. For my present purpose, it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
that those who want it at home so often
mistake it for such abroad. Ideots and Infants
experience the force of Beauty, nay better per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
than Philosophers. The Peasant takes the
infection assoon as the Prince. In a word, the
Dominion of Beauty reaches to both the Poles,
and 'tis withall so despotick as often to endanger
the great Charter of our Reason. Therefore
Providence will be sure to interest it self more
remarkably in the assignment of this property
than of the other. But how does this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
comport with the daily testimony of our
eyes? Have not Traytors, High-way-men, and
Prostitutes Complexion and Feature as taking
as Saints? Yes verily, more taking than those
of one sort of Saints. Nay we generally incline
to fancy a Padder in the Cart, or a Curtezan
without her Mask, singularly handsome. And
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:94057:16"/>
sometimes too, yet not so often, a Rebel shall
carry an attracting Countenance, though in our
Country, I believe, more instances might be
brought of the contrary. But here we ought to
make ample allowances for Compassion, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
and Prejudice. We hope to mitigate
the Prisoner's fate by helping out the blemishes
of his defects by our Illustrations of his good
Qualities. Again, we understand to what vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent
and frequent Temptations a blooming
Beauty is expos'd; and thence infer the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of the Town cannot be ugly. And then
as for Traytors, God knows they too usually
pass with the Multitude for either the Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
of Heaven if they prosper, or if otherwise,
for the Martyrs of its cause, not to appear at
least Angelical. Whereas these false Opticks
laid aside, we shall fairly discern an air very
disobliging in each of these lewd Master-pieces.
Guilt, Discomposure, and Depravity pass the
Pores of the Cheeks, and tarnish all their genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
Lustre. For it must be remember'd that
all the Irregularities of Passion and Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite
are equally a Distemper of the body as of
the Mind, and imprint their foul Characters
in the Countenance as well as in the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
The Soul after its fall cannot rest till it
has involv'd the body in its Forfeiture, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
it at a high rate that the Servant should
fare any better than the Mistress. Yet these
acquir'd Deformities are most visible in sudden
and violent cases. Indignation does the seat in
a trice, and creates a new face as readily as a
Mirror represents it. The Forehead gathers,
the Eyes flash, the Cheeks whiten, the Teeth
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:94057:17"/>
are set, the Mouth trembles, and the Foam
boils at each corner of it, and thus the fair <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dusa</hi>'s
metamorphos'd into a <hi>Gorgon.</hi> Nor is
Lust less active: the Blood overflows the Face,
the Eye flames, and dances, the Postures of the
Body are light and various. All Grace and
Decency fly off, and the man personates the
Monkey without looking so well. Of Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance
the consequences are little better. It
entails a ridiculous Inflammation upon the
Cheeks and Nose, and fastens a perpetual Small
Pox upon the Countenance. It scares a man
from all use of his own Looking-glass, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
him one to every body else. Envy poisons
the Visage, but the Poet may interpose not
unseasonably upon this head,
<q>
                  <l>Pallor in ore sedet, Macies in corpore toto, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
               <q>
                  <l>Paleness intense besets her Meager Face;</l>
                  <l>Her strutting Ribs extend their Vellum Case:</l>
                  <l>Her Eyes obliquely cast their noxious Rays,</l>
                  <l>While on her Heart an inbred Venom preys.</l>
                  <l>Perish'd her Teeth, and Gangreen in her Tongue,</l>
                  <l>Nor smiles, but when with Indignation stung.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>A very exquisite Beauty indeed! and yet as
much as here seems to be of Fiction, the Vizard
is no more than natural. Avarice very much
favours Envy. 'Tis a famish'd raw-bon'd Vice,
and happier only in this single respect, that it is
ever so sollicitous about the Dust, as to remain
utterly unconcern'd for any thing else. Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality
makes a fine show for a little while, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
bright and gay, and keeps its colour so
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:94057:17"/>
long as it keeps a Support in the Pocket, but
makes a wretched figure in rags, with fallen
Cheeks and a lank Belly. Instances innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
might be tack'd to these, if they were not
notorious enough of themselves. Yet one more
I must not omit, the Dissembler. And 'tis
plainly impossible for him to have, or at least to
preserve any good looks from Forehead to Chin,
and Ear to Ear. 'Tis a mere Posture-Master:
And artificial Convulsions ruine a good set of
Features sooner than natural. The most pliant
parts of the Face, which are the Eyes and the
Mouth, carry a great sway in its Symmetry, and
are the principal Organs of Dissimulation. These
are turn'd, and wreathed, and modell'd some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
different ways at once, that to me it seems
a Miracle that all Hypocrites don't squint, but
come off without inverted Pupils, Sparrow-Mouths
and blubber'd Lips, especially, whenas
it happens sometimes, two opposite Species of
Dissimulation concenter in the same person, at
one time pretending himself worse than he is,
at another time better. But the first of these,
which <hi>Theophrastus</hi> has incomparably characte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riz'd
is much more easily practis'd, much more
compatible with comely Features, altho' less in
use than the other. But old men, I have observ'd,
have the slight on't beyond all else, the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
whereof I cannot understand, for where, I
wonder, should they have a Modicum of Spirits
active and subtle enough to vary countenance
and complexion? Such an Atchievement, if I
mistake not, requires strength of Nature. To
create Faces, and (if I may so speak) <hi>Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faces,</hi>
implies vigorous Blood and a Skin yet sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:94057:18"/>
However 'tis certain we play our parts
best in the last Act, except down right Dotage
overtake us, although that too's dissembled of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
enough.</p>
            <p>But to return to the main Argument, and
summ up the Evidence; I know of nothing that
can encourage the great Endower to conferr or
continue these Excellencies of the second Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude
so much as a right use of them; nothing
that can provoke him to with-hold or remove
them so much as a perverse one. It asks no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Energy of Omnipotence to make a
man either a Fool or a <hi>Thersites.</hi> A slight alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
in the Brain, Blood or Nerves brought
about by a natural course will do the business.
If this be so, 'tis best looking to our selves, for
when the genuine brightness is lost, borrow'd
Lines and bought Charms expose more than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend.
At last to turn Dry-Nurse to the
Children of other People's Brains argues both
impotence and indigence <hi>Spanish</hi>-Wool upon
the Wreck and Ruins of Beauty sits worse than
fresh Vermillion in an old rusty Head, though
an Original of some eminent Master's. But
Vertue infallibly conveys to us both Wit and
Beauty. 'Tis confest indeed <hi>Socrates</hi> had a flat
Nose, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> a contemptible presence, yet
no question the Effulgency of the Proto-Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr's
face descended to a sufferer so eminent as
St. <hi>Paul.</hi> And as for <hi>Socrates,</hi> we know his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting
Country-men soon after his Death ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
a Statue in honour of him, which but for
the Vertues of the Original had been only a
most severe aggravation of his Sentence. Not
that I imagine good Manners make a new face,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:94057:18"/>
but what then? may they not brighten a native
coarseness? may not the serenity and transport of
the Mind add life to the Eyes, and smiles to
the Mouth, and colour to the Cheeks? and
not only so, but elevate and prompt the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation?
'Tis no less than a necessary effect, and
he that thinks otherwise, may perhaps retain
the Graces of his Phiz, but has foregone t'o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing already, that's certain.</p>
            <p>Yet at last, as the most ingenious Mr. <hi>Collier</hi>
says, no man's Face is actionable; and I may
add, nor his Dulness outlawry. Let it suffice
that the observation holds true in the Main.
When the odds are so considerable, 'tis a madness
to venture, and the more so, because when the
Cargo is once sunk, there's no diving for't ever
after. However the broken Merchant may in
time rig out again, but a Wit or a Beauty
Bankrupt remains a Bankrupt at least to the
day of Judgment. The Brain untun'd very
rarely and very late, if at all, settles to rights a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and faded Beauty must be acknowledged
all the world over a desperate case. In short,
we mistake Vertue, when we conceive her home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and rough-hewn, disaffected to all the Race
and Ornaments of Wit, and more injurious to
a man's person, than Dislocations or Diseases,
whereas on the contrary, nothing can so fairly
merit, nothing so certainly provide, nothing so
effectually, and to so long a period preserve both
Quickness of Parts and Comeliness of Form as

            <p>THere cannot be a clearer Confession of
the heinousness of Offences against
the Publick, than every <hi>Catiline</hi>'s
pretending to be a Patriot: 'tis true
their own Interest often, if not always counsels
it, for what blunder so unpardonable in the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks
of those men who aim at the subversion
of Government and Laws as to practise nakedly
and without a gloss. But still as they vaunt
and pride themselves in appearing instrumental
to the common Good, they evidently bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to the dignity of the Vertue, and expose
the monstrousness of their own proceedings:
so that one would admire not so much how
the Plebeian world comes to be impos'd upon by
the Sophistry, as how such pestilent Assertors
can dextrously manage the matter between their
Words and their Actions. However these In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendiaries,
at least if they chance to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
before they have crown'd their enterprize
(for if they can once grasp the end of their hopes
they are sure of a good title) in the proper no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of 'em are odious and detestable every-where.
Yet at the same time whole thousands may lie
in a Common wealth mere mortify'd Limbs,
and as unnecessary as Lap-dogs. Men of ample
Capacities and Fortunes may without any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement
lurk in their soft retirements, and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:94057:19"/>
when a Storm gathers or breaks upon the state,
when Tyrants and Invaders are pillaging and
proscribing, 'tis but a commendable and sober
caution, forsooth, to keep close and supinely
contemplate the Destruction, or rather to make
ones self even not so much as a Spectator. But
should the Retirer exert the strength of so much
as his little Finger in the service of his Country,
should he run the Risque of having the Crusts
of his <hi>Cheshire</hi> Cheese, or the Drippings of his
<hi>March</hi> Beer confiscated, he'd presently suspect
he had forfeited his Patrimony for a Fool, as if
to be wanting to his Country were not an indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
kind of Sedition, and not to abett her cause,
to strengthen and animate that of her Enemies.
What opinion, I wonder, of Piety to his fellow-Citizens
must such a man have embrac'd? how
must he look upon Political Duties as mere <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonick</hi>
Ideas? a sort of pretty, airy, fabulous, ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantick
Whimsies, and nothing but Brats of
the Imagination, obligatory upon none but Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious
and Hypocondriacal Consciences?
Thus therefore he argues, <q>What, am I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted
to my Country more than my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try's
indebted to me? so long as my interest
is wrapt in hers, I thing my self bound to
expose my self for us both, but when the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
of publick Affairs does not immediately
affect mine, ev'n let my Neighbours shift for
themselves, and the people at the Helm steer
just as they please. For what's the King and
his Council to me? and how can I help it,
if Constitutions will change? alas! <hi>Omnium
rerum vicissitudo.</hi> Providence decreed it, and
'twere impious to resist its Decrees, and so
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:94057:20"/>
for my part, I'll not trouble my head with
the justifiableness or unjustifiableness of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
but study my own convenience and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
and let the World rowl on as it pleases.</q>
Behold Sir <hi>Sociable Self-love</hi> in Epitome, a little
nasty inconsiderate Drone, without courage e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to put him upon Action, and yet without
sense enough to frame his Excuse. And then how
discreet the Resolution! for a Powder-Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key
to talk of enjoying himself under Hatches,
when he knows the Pilot's about to drive him
upon a Rock, because indeed he knows himself
to be a Powder-Monkey. But does he believe
his insignificancy will be his security in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
danger, a Pass-port through the Waves?
Such a decree of Providence, I'm sure he has
no reason to depend upon. Or does he fansie
his Hammock will serve him for a Long-boat,
and that he alone shall swim to shore upon his
back without striking? 'Tis a jest to talk of so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacing
at home and indulging Genius in the
midst of publick Distractions and Confusions.
Every Individual must be a party in spite of his
Teeth, and obscurity of condition instead of
exempting, makes a man more the object of Rage
and Oppression, and I dare say, if your <hi>Suburb-Gentlemen</hi>
would but carry along with them
this Maxim, That he whom at first a publick E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
least respects, in the conclusion becomes
most obnoxious to it, although then least of all
able to divert it, we should have them bestir
themselves in the first place. They would scowre
up the old Muskets and Head-pieces in the Hall,
shake off the delicious Lethargy, and take the
Field before the Veterans. The first Alarm
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:94057:20"/>
would fetch 'em out of their Quarters, and self-preservation
would work Miracles. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
nothing can be more obvious than that
an Innovator will be tempted to lay the severest
burthens upon them, of whose Pusillanimity he
has had such experience, and whom he very well
knows to be always unprovided against his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments.
Nothing can sollicit an usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
power so much to exercise its violence
more upon one man than another, (excepting in
the Case of Competition) as meanness of Spirit
joyn'd with littleness of condition. Be it so,
yet these Neutrals are prepar'd to gratifie the
Publick, and establish their own reputations some
other way. One perhaps by laying out the
Cash he knows not how to dispose of, upon
publick Edifices and Endowments. 'Tis but
erecting an Hospital, a Country-School, or a
Chapel of Ease, and then he counts so highly of
his merit, that Heaven, he presumes, may ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well compound for a thousand Tergiversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Compliances: as if, like the Masons of
<hi>Babel,</hi> he hop'd to build his way up thither.
Another sets so much by his Intellectuals, that
he thinks the fruits of his Understanding may
expiate for the perverseness of his Will and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.
Upon this Presumption he veers to
all Points, deserts a Cause, or espouses it, as
he holds most convenient, and thinks if his Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes
of Arts, Sciences, Languages, and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities
keep pace with the black Volumes of
his Trespasses, he bids fair for future Glorifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And if he can dandle some mens curiosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and perhaps do a little serious good in the
opinion of others, instead of seeming a Cypher
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:94057:21"/>
in his Generation, he looks upon himself a
main prop of the State, and in the high road to
Preferment and Esteem. A third pitches upon
a different method, distributes his Money, his
Loaves, and his Small Beer ev'ry Market-day;
and whether he be a Guelf or Gibelline, for
Turk or Pope, Monarchy-man, Fifth-Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy-man,
or no Monarchy-man, Whig, Tory,
or Trimmer, all, or some, or none, he has
made such Friends both in this World and in
the next, that he need not question, but he shall
have very good usage here, and no uncomforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
reception when he leaves us. Such Refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
as these give birth to that abjectness and
indifference of temper so universally both affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and applauded. Now the summ of all is
this, They don't much care, if they benefit the
Common-wealth a little, when they are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the interest of their own Benefaction, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
also they may take their own measures:
but if any Mortification's to be undergone, if
the prick of a Pin must be endur'd, Fire and
Sword may consume a whole Continent before
they'll stir a foot from their Dormitories. Now
for my part, I think these men might as well
declare openly and ingenuously against a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
as remain thus reserv'd and unactive,
for as silence in general is interpreted Consent;
so in a publick Cause, it may justly pass for an
approbation of the worst Practices, since 'tis
not to be doubted, but he who has not courage
enough to assert and suffer in the interest of the
Community, has not integrity enough to be
trusted in its concerns; although Perfidiousness
and Disingenuity more than enough to make its
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:94057:21"/>
Enemies depend upon him. On th'other
hand, what spectacle so glorious as a generous
Maintainer of his Country's true Liberties,
courting all Hazards and embracing all Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes
for her preservation and advantage,
quitting the little dirty satisfactions of Life,
loathing and deriding the dull empty excuses
and alleviations of Deserters, yet never to be
brow beaten out of his Modesty, good Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
or Chearfulness. He receives the worst
indignities with a smile, indulges and caresses
the very Enemies of his cause, and will do any
thing but take their example: for Complacency
and Orderliness ever accompany the Generosity
of a Publick Spirit. Then too the shyest part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
will readily repose a confidence in him, who
relinquishes all present enjoyments and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
rather than the Greatness and Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of his mind. No secrets but those of Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
in their proper trade shall escape his hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
so safe a repository is his breast, that how
much soever the sentiments of those who know
him may differ from his, they had rather dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burthen
their minds to him than to one another.
Nor is he only Master of their thoughts, but
often works them insensibly into a concern and
esteem, if not for his cause, yet however
for himself, at least so far, as to have his necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
reliev'd, and his Principles valued, for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
never omits to preserve such a force of
humanity in the bosoms of most Revolters, as
may sollicit a provision for perseverers. But
then what inexpressible exultations does the
brave man conceive within, when he calls over
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:94057:22"/>
his principles and practices, while his Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
entertains him with such Musick as this?
<q>Happy Hero! whom no allurements of Riches,
Pleasure, and Parade; no tumults of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
no menaces of Tyrants, no inflictions
of those Threats can prevail upon to renounce
thy regard of the Publick! Triumph, for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
triumph within thy self, and commise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
the weakness of those Wretches, who
either want judgment and consideration e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to learn the momentousness of that
duty, or (which is worse) have not the
heart to perform it. 'Tis true, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
thy Indignation and Contempt, and
have too much Charity for themselves to
have almost any just Title to any body's else:
Yet deny them not thy pity and good wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es;
nay condescend even to familiarity and
respect. But be sure remain proof against
all their gay promises and all their stupid
Satyr. Let <hi>Curtius, Cocles,</hi> and the <hi>Hora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tii</hi>
haunt thy imagination, and refine upon
their Vertues with the more excellent Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of thy own Religion. Thus reign
as perfect as the Stoicks Pattern, and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
in the glorious transports of thy noble
Soul.</q>

            <p>O ravishing Harmony! what Mind so fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid,

to signifie its Zeal? or in case, even
the main and last stake of all must be parted
with, the gallant man collects his vigour,
redoubles his Fortitude, calmly submits to the

            <head>Of the Weather.</head>
            <p>ABout three Months since, invited by
a Friend to share the pleasures of his
rustication, and enjoying a short re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spit
from a knotty concern, I scorn'd
to decline the proffer, but was attended all my
Journey long, and the best part of my stay at
his house, with a most uncomfortable season of
Weather, enough to have made me repent my
forwardness, but that the good Coversation
of the Family, and some Parlour-diversions we
found out amongst us, diverted the Spleen, till
such time as matters mended, which fell out, I
remember, one night at Eleven of the Clock,
when my Companions had all betaken themselves
to their repose; but I resolving the Moon
should not shine so seldom to so little purpose, e'en
took a solitary walk of a Mile, and at the Mile's
end arriv'd at a large stump of a Tree, by some
honest lazy Hind, hatcheted into an Elbow
Chair. Here I squatted, and after a little bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
my self for my being once more restor'd to
the open Air, fell to meditating upon the past
dismal Scene, when from an hollow Tree, just
over against me, starts forth a person of a sage
and serious Countennace, wrapp'd in a Morning-Gown,
with a large Ruff round his Neck, a
Broad-brim'd, high-crown'd Hat upon his head,
under his right arm a Terrestrial Globe, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:94057:23"/>
his Left a load of Books. This appearance
did not a little terrifie me: my Hair bristled,
my Blood curdled, and Nature had for certain
done a diskindness to my Breeches, unless I had
been animated in the nick by the courteous ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress
of my Visitant, who entreated me not to
fear, for that he presented himself with no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
design than to assist me in my Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
I was, <hi>said he,</hi> formerly your Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
in an age when Letters and Ingenuity,
which are now so coldly encourag'd, were am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
honour'd and rewarded, as well as Plain-dealing
and Honesty, and for my own part, as
I always lov'd the latter (though I know what
some people have thought of me) so I made it
my business to promote and improve the former.
Who I am, these Volumes will teach you; and
at the same instant he display'd the Title-page
of the uppermost, wherein was in capital Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to be read, <hi>NOVUM ORGANON.</hi> But
to pass directly to the present business, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
he, which by what I overheard of your
Soliloquy, I understand to be the unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness
of the Weather, I must first entreat you
to dismiss all fear, and in the next place, know
that notwithstanding by that nearer admission
to Physical secrets which since my retreat from
this neather world, I have obtained, it might
suffice, should I simply relate the measures Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
has taken in bringing about these unusual
Events, yet because I am to discoutse with such
a Being as can draw no Inferences, but upon
sight of their Connexion with Premises, and
because by that Being, the matter is to be sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
and publish'd amongst others of the same
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:94057:24"/>
Species, I shall not only make appear the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness
of my Assertions by their just depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
upon one another, but give you the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of interposing, when any Scruples arise. I
confess, when I carry'd Flesh and Blood about
me, being much inclin'd to amplifie the several
parts of Philosophy and Learning, I introduc'd
a considerable number of obscure Terms, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in my Book of the Copiousness of the Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
but then I always expounded their mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and am now as desirous both to express my
self intelligibly, and maintain my Arguments
rationally. Nay more, to make appear with
what Candour and Condescension I design to
treat you, before I lay down any Hypothesis of
my own, I request from you a concise ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the Sentiments of your <hi>Vertuosi</hi> upon
this point, which we departed Philosophers sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
trouble our selves about; not that they
lie beyond the Sphere of our apprehension, but
our own Illuminations are so great, that all the
Acquisitions of Mortals, as extraordinary as
you imagine some of your latter to be, are less
valued by us than poor <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
by the generality of you. Here he paus'd, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
my Narrative, toward which I thus
set forward: In the first place, I would not
have your Lordship presume my Catalogue of
Opinions compleat, for since no one <hi>Vertuoso,</hi>
that I know of, has hitherto communicated his
Sentiments upon this Question to the Publick;
a shrewd Sign they are little interested in Acres
or Orchards, I can answer your demands no
otherwise than by enumerating the several pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Conjectures, which, as my Friends tell me,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:94057:24"/>
have been made by sundry of the Learned. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
one would almost conclude either Life or
Fortune lay at stake; else in despite of the Itch
of Curiosity, that next these, has the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullest
influence upon our Latitudinarian <hi>Vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oso's,</hi>
they could as soon have kept Lent, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
an Hypothesis for Transubstantiation, as
left this argument untouch'd. Besides, these
violent and frequent alterations in the Weather
serve for a perpetual Monitor, by discompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
their Constitutions, blunting their Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and splenetizing the poor Gentlemen all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
Like <hi>Quevedo</hi>'s Necromancer in the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
they're loath to uncork and come abroad
for fear of the mischiefs reigning without, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
too, most of them are Evils of their
own brooding. There, they think, they may
lie snug, and swim daintily in Metaphysicks,
which once reckon'd the Dyet of Philosophick
Camelions they have now, if you'll believe 'em,
beat up to a Consistency, and render'd more
substantial and solid than the Creed it self. I
am unwilling to particularize Persons; though
if I were to name any, it should be the dull
Bogtrotting Abstractor, that by a worse bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
than the foolishest Hag in all <hi>Lapland,</hi>
pawn'd his Soul in prospect of reputation, and
in the conclusion lost his purchase. But I beg
your Lordship's pardon for my Digression, and
now pass to the Conjectures that have already
been made amongst Friends about the Question
we are upon. The first and most common is,
That by some unlucky shove, our Globe of Earth
has been justled out of its primitive Position;
that the North Pole has suffer'd no inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:94057:25"/>
Declination, and that to this Declinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is owing all that excessive Cold Rain and
Wind which we on the Northern Side have felt
for so long a succession of Years. Nothing but
this, as the Defenders of the Hypothesis main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
could possibly beget such wonderfull
Changes, and rather than forego the least mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that may advantage their cause, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to trump up the device of the old Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomers,
who having by means of an accurate
tradition learn'd that the fix'd Stars had shifted
their Site within a certain term of years, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crib'd
it to such an unheeded Jogg. But me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks,
what was objected to those Sages then,
may as reasonably be thrown in the dish of
these: which way such a thing might happen
without being perceiv'd, and whether they
thought all Mankind were in that minute so fast,
that the Jolt could not wake them? I was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding,
but his Lordship cry'd, Hold; and
setting down his Globe upon the seat, look you,
says he, it is evident I cannot depress the North-Pole
of this Globe, which now exactly answers
our Elevation, but the Position of it, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to the fix'd Stars and the Courses of the
Planets will be necessarily chang'd; so that if
the Depression were of Thirty Degrees, the
Stars, which before were Vertical to the Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth
Degree of Northern Latitude, would be
manifestly remov'd Twenty Degrees Southward:
nothing like which appearing in the face of the
Heavens, that alone refutes the assertion. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
could Sun and Moon rise and set as they
us'd to do; whereas these Speculators must
have lost their Eye-sight by the great improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:94057:25"/>
and use of their Glasses, unless they have
observ'd the contrary. Presumers indeed! that
fancy 'tis but giving the Earth a kick, and the
whole difficulty's solv'd. I would also know
from what causes this Convulsion should arise.
Nature is not given to starting: her motions
are equal, orderly and gentle. All things cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate
by an insensible Transition. There is no
surer sign of Inconstancy and Irregularity than
Abruptness. The cap'ring of a Beau, and the
catchings of a dying Man, though effects of
opposite Principles agree in this, that they are
alike the Symptoms and Consequences of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemperature.
The Celestial Bodies are all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
to the same degrees and lines of motion,
and the spiral progress of the Sun was never to
be charg'd hitherto, unless on the score of a
Miracle, with interruption or deviation. Be
pleas'd, therefore, to proceed to the second.
I shall, reply'd I, acknowledging you have more
fully convinc'd me than I had my self of the
absurdity of that opinion, the next, to which
is, in my judgment, ne'er a jot a more ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
being chiefly adapted to the extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of the Cardanists, men that value no other
Solutions than those fetch'd from the Postures
of the Stars, or Conjunctions of Planets: not
that they have yet erected a Scheme, or parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
examin'd the state of the Heavenly Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies:
but they are sure the whole matter may
be illustrated this way, and care not a Straw
how the Heavens are accommodated, as long as
they can accommodate their Notions to them:
as for example, are <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> in Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction?
'Tis a sure signification of an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:94057:26"/>
Wenching-Season at <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Naples,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
forsooth! the familiarity of those two
Planets is so very notorious; in <hi>Hungary,</hi> of
success to the <hi>Turks,</hi> denoted by <hi>Mars</hi> superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
to <hi>Venus;</hi> or of the contrary, <hi>Venus</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
the effeminacy of the Sultan, and <hi>Mars</hi>
the power and vigour of the Emperour. In
<hi>England,</hi> a Peace, a Plot, or any thing that
falls out. But I ought not to forestall your
Lordship, considering you, since your Manumis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
from Mortality, may have taken a Voyage,
as by a late Author we understand of Monsieur
<hi>des Cartes,</hi> through the Regions of the Upper
Worlds, and learn'd what their Correspondence
and mutual Impressions are. Be that so as you
suspect, or otherwise, said he, 'tis sufficient
that by knowledge atchievable in this world,
you may learn the ridiculousness of their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions,
who would make you believe they can
interpret the Language of all Revolutions and
Aspects over their heads, as easily and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> undertake to prick down
their Harmony; a Crew that do no more than
disgrace all humane Learning and Philosophy,
but infest and undermine the Common-wealth.
Thus <hi>Ephemerides</hi> and Almanacks are become
a Political poison; a man cannot look what day
of the Month 'tis, but seditious Dogrel stares
him in the face. Nor will ever any Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
be more auspicious, than of such miscre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
Heads with Pillory or Halter. Besides,
what order or disposition of the Heavenly Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
will these men pitch upon, as effective of
such consequences? or how will they prove such
a disposition so effective: Since they themselves
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:94057:26"/>
have not done it, much less will I, Sir, trouble
your head with examining particularly what
have been the motions and postures of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
bodies for these dozen years past. In ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
I know of no such extraordinary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions
as such extraordinary Effects require.
Have <hi>Orion</hi> and the <hi>Pleiades</hi> been in Trine with
<hi>Aquarius?</hi> or has <hi>Virgo</hi> been troubled with a
Diabetes so long? Proceed, I beseech you, Sir.
Others, answer'd I, seem rather inclin'd to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that the last Comet was the Parent of all
our unseasonable Weather; and this comes
from very judicious persons, who not unjustly
suspect, that the main Effects of a Comet are
late and rarely to be perceiv'd till a considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
time after the appearance. And for my
own part, I do not only think this Conjecture
probable, but further believe, that instead of
civil, they always portend natural Changes.
Battles, Rebellions, and State-Revolutions seem
to have very little affinity with their fiery Strea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,
unless in the destructiveness of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the irregularity of the motion. Your
judgment of Comets, reply'd his Honour, is very
apposite; but I am sorry your men of such a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
sagacity should link an Effect to a Cause
before they have discern'd the dependance of
one upon the other. 'Tis venturing too far,
and laying a Brat to the next comer. We ought
to be cautious in pronouncing so near relations,
especially when they succeed one another at so
long a distance of time; from which circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
we may pretty securely gather, that if a
Cause, Comets are however a remote Cause
of such Innovations, and if Naturalists will
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:94057:27"/>
solve Effects by remote Causes, at that rate a
man may be said to be the effect of Beef and Mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.
Comets may indeed have miraculous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences,
but who can be confident of their apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to produce those Events, much less, of their
begetting them immediately, and without the
intervention of other Causes. Though least of
all, methinks they should be the cause of abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of Rain, as rather suited to dissipate all
collections of moist Bodies, and proving too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
the fore-runners of excessive heats, and those
Epidemical Mischiefs which are thence deriv'd.
Once more I therefore return to your self, and
demand the next Hypothesis. There remain
yet, said I, some behind, but I desire another
may content you; and that such as is by some
contended for with no less vehemence than any
of the rest. However, 'tis but a partial Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and reaches no further backward than last
<hi>Christmas,</hi> about which time you may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
the Czar made us a visit, and brought along
with him all the Winter and bad Weather in
<hi>Muscovy.</hi> Then could not, cry'd <hi>Verulam,</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment
convince this Sect, for I dare say, had
any of them approach'd within breath shot of
that mighty Prince, they would soon have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
he had brought them over more Heat
than Cold. However if he brought it, yet
since he has not carry'd it back again, 'tis fit we
make a further enquiry into the reason of its
continuance: and because you say you are cloy'd
with other people's Notions, avoiding Pream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
I shall now begin to you my own Lecture,
your kind attention first bespoken. You have
heard, I make no question, and read much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:94057:27"/>
Central Fire, and may have observ'd that
notwithstanding Philosophers disagree among
themselves as to the material Causes, the means
of Perpetuation, and several other circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
so far they all consent, that there certainly
is such a thing. And indeed the existence of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
part of nature is perhaps the ultimate object
of natural Philosophy. Essences and Forms are
an intricate sort of concern, and will never be
effectually unriddled till Matter may be reduc'd
to an indivisible, yet discernible Minuteness.
This is the only sure method to come at them;
they lie more closely immur'd, than Gems in
the foundation of a Rock, and nothing less than
a total dissolution of their subject can bring 'em
to light. This I speak with respect to you
Mortals, for I am not to tell you what advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
the casting my Carcass has brought me,
least you should follow old <hi>Empedocles</hi>'s steps,
and caper out of the world the better to come
acquainted with it. The Experiment indeed
look'd brave, but Central Fire is no such lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent
Flame that a wise man should like to wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
in't. Elementary or not Elementary, gray
Beards will singe by't. And therefore of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>Vertuoso's</hi> who have exercis'd their Wits upon
this subject, none have been since so frolick some
as to make such a desperate proof of those
Flames. Instead of sensible Demonstration all
rest satisfied with their own rational Inferences.
<hi>Plato</hi> for his part troubles himself with no more
than the confession of its Being. <hi>Aristotle</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues
the matter further, and tells you in his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Book of Meteorologicks; the eighth Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter,
the cause of this fire, which he takes to
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:94057:28"/>
be the accension of Spirits upon violently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countring
one another in Air very much atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated.
<hi>Lucretius</hi> in his account of <hi>Aetna</hi>
speaks much to the same purpose, and counting
from even <hi>Thales,</hi> that trusty Friend of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Water, down to Father <hi>Kircher</hi> and
<hi>Burnet,</hi> you will find the number of those who
deny Central Fire to be very inconsiderable.
Some, 'tis true, have plac'd Water in the room
on't, and others Adamant, but upon no other
account than to support an Hypothesis, for
which your peremptory Systematist boldly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storts
Nature, and stuffs her inside with any
thing that may best serve his turn. Thus when
a great Ox is made to bear up the World, a
Tortoise must be added to sustain the Ox. Not
that I advise you to lay too great a stress upon
Authority, especially in cases which admit of a
better proof, as does the present. The System
of things, when we behold it, at first view sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gests
as much, and that very remarkably. <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suvius,
Aetna, Hecla,</hi> the <hi>Philippine, Molucca,
Canary</hi> Islands, and a thousand other places be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
in the several quarters of the World are
evident and unexceptionable Arguments. Those
inexhaustible Sources of Fire cannot but have a
deeper root than is ordinarily imagin'd, even
<hi>Borellu</hi>'s Arguments notwithstanding. Add to
this, how necessary such a common Stove must
be for the propagation and preservation of all
Beings animate and inanimate. The Sun, 'tis
true, is a great Cherisher, but he plays only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-board,
and seems rather to consummate
and polish, than primarily generate. So cold
a Birth-place as the Surface of the Earth, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:94057:28"/>
for Plants and Trees of a tender Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
would be apt to chill the Embryo, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
a moderate warmth rose from beneath as
well as descended from above. And the Fruits,
those Sweet-meats of nature, as a certain Bard
very elegantly sings, must be utterly spoil'd in
the confection, should the Dame be too sparing
of her Fewel, which yet why she should, seems
very unaccountable, seeing she is so plentifully
furnish'd with it: as I could shew at large by an
Induction of particulars, but choose rather to
refer you at your leisure to Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi>'s second
Part of his Theory. Though Father <hi>Kircher</hi>'s
remark being short, I shall here give you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he was eminently acquanted with the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Labyrinths of the Earth, and had in a great
measure anticipated Purgatory e'er he left the
upper. How is't possible, says he, such an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of Sulphur, Bitumen, Naptha, and
all sorts of Minerals should be found so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly,
and that in the cold confines of Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
and Darkness, quite beyond the reach of the
Sun's Influence, unless the Womb of Nature
supply'd a secret invigorating Warmth? The
observation's good, and as we cannot conceive
for what end she should lay in such a vast stock,
unless for the sustenance of this mighty Flame,
so the readiest and most likely course of prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and concocting these large portions of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
seems to be by the action of Central Fire.
Not to mention the gradual increase of heat,
which the illustrious Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> in his Treatise of
the temperature of the Subterranean Regions
has taken notice of. Nor need I send you fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for proof than to the common News-papers,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:94057:29"/>
which have been daily full of terrible relations
about <hi>Aetna</hi> and <hi>Vesuvius;</hi> how violent their late
Irruptions have been, and what vast quantities
they have discharg'd of Stones and Ashes, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
utterly wast all the adjacent Parts, and
frighting the Neighbourhood out of their Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
and Wits. The poor unkennell'd Fryars
thereabouts I dare say are ready to bear me out
in my Assertion, and convinc'd to their cost of
the reality of Central Fire: Which being by
this time made good, I have yet farther to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain,
how this Fire not only lasts, but encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
How it should be continually fed is a question
somewhat difficult in appearance. It must have
continued so long, and consumed in that time
so great a portion of Aliment, that you will be
apt to wonder with your self which way the
stock should last out till this time; a Riddle as
perplexing as that of many a beggarly Beau's li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
up to the condition of a Peer of the Realm.
And indeed if that matter which sustains the
Central Fire were as suddenly to be consum'd
as such a ones fortunes, the Central Fire of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
had been extinct long ago, for it cannot
live upon tick, and no sooner misses its usual
Food but vanishes. Hence it is easie for some
to infer, that the Aliment already dissipated by
the Flame, must according to the Laws and
Order of Nature's Revolutions be converted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
into matter suitable to maintain the Fire
as it did before; yet what may be done without
these Transmutations I shall presently discover,
but before I attempt this Discovery, must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to hear your Scruples about any thing alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
offer'd, that I may, as 'tis but just, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:94057:29"/>
to remove 'em. I made answer, that
what he had said carry'd in it a great deal of
probability; that I was sufficiently satisfied of
the Central Fire, and did not at all doubt of
his being able to state the measures of its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation:
Yet notwithstanding that I had these
two Queries to propose, first, Why the Centre
of the Earth might not be solid and of Stone:
next, Why if not solid, it might not however be
a Pool of Water; about which two points I
thought his Lordship had discours'd more spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly
than he needed. The Arguments, said
he, which I have already brought to confirm
your belief of a Central Fire suffice without any
other to answer both your Queries, no more being
requisite to prove the Centre of the Earth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Water nor Stone, than evincing it to be
Fire: but because you may be more fairly sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,
I shall not decline to bring some further
evidence of the Supposition. And I am sorry it
is my misfortune that the Argument I shall now
urge is of that kind, against which I my self
have so strenuously inveigh'd. However, now
I am become sensible of my error, and declare
that I think the Tendencies and Ends of things
contribute mainly to the knowledge of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
Accordingly I would gladly know to
what purpose the Centre should have been ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a Rock or a Puddle. If indeed this mighty
Globe could have been fashion'd no otherwise
than a Snow-ball, or had been destin'd to the
office of a <hi>Water-bottle,</hi> something like it might
be presum'd. For as for any further use of one or
t'other, I can by no means understand what it
should be. Those inmost Regions ought mu<gap reason="illegible: broken" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:94057:30"/>
rather to be the seat of the first Springs of Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Vertue, than a mere dead pond<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rous
Quarry. Perhaps you'll tell me 'tis sixt there
for Ballast. But how it should serve for such,
is to me as unintelligible, as if you should say it's
there for a rowling-stone. Instead of poizing, I
look upon such a Mass as rather fitted to unpoize,
and break those Mystick Chains upon which the
body of the Earth hangs. I grant indeed that
of whatever matter we constitute the Centre,
we shall be equally puzled to find out a stay. That
fine Ethereal Gulph in which the Earth swims,
is of so yielding a temper, that Waters far more
capable of supporting Gold than that its Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
However if any one Species of Matter
be more convenient than another, Fire being
the lightest and the most active should certainly
be it. You have, I presume, been often an
eye-witness of its power to carry heavy Bodies
through the Air. Your Bombs, which have
been invented since my Halcyon days, are a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Specimen of this. And that Element
which forces such pond'rous Matter so rapidly
through the air, cannot but most suit with its
hanging in it. Then as for the use of Water,
that's acknowledg'd to concern more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
the provisions of Life, and a Pool situate
so low, could neither furnish us with Fish, if
it entertain'd wholesome, nor serve for the Sun
to exhale Vapours from, or us to sail upon. To
those who would make it a Cistern for the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
of Ocean and Rivers, I need only hint that
natural property of all Water never to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
the level of its own Superficies, unless
when Violence is offer'd it. Thus your two
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:94057:30"/>
Questions are, I hope, satisfactorily answer'd,
and if you have any other doubts remaining
propose 'em, or expect me to proceed. I
thank'd his Lordship for his fair dealing, and
acquainted him I had no more Objections to
enter, for as for what some surmiz'd that there
is nothing but a large Cavern at the Centre fill'd
with Mists and Exhalations: the grounds of
their belief appear'd to me so slight, that I
would not trouble his Lordship to discuss them.
Then his Lordship thus again put forward, Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that which I lately offer'd, I shall
next instruct you in what manner the Aliment
of this Fire is perpetually provided: and this I
cannot better do, than by beginning at the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration
of the Fire it self, which penetrating the
Pores of the matter lodg'd next to it, and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the various Particles of it, devours as many
of 'em as are light and manageable, but sends up
the moist and phlegmatick through Chinks and
Passages of its own creating into Regions near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
the Earth's Superficies, or where it can obtain
a vent, quite out of it. The order of which
Analysis exactly corresponds with that of the
Chymists, for first of all rise their two Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
and Phlegm, and then their Sulphur and
Salt. The only difference is, that the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist's
Fire being much less vehement than the
Central, and the inclosures of the Central con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining
the sulphureous, implicated, and heavier
parts, that they cannot rise as in an Alembick,
such sulphureous and heavier parts are by the
power of the flame so broken and intermixt, as
to become constant nourishment for it. And
thus, as is evident, it does not merely sustain it
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:94057:31"/>
self, but propagates too, and diffuses upon the
ruins of its Neighbours. By what stated de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
it prevails, is hard to guess, there being
no mover in the world more undisciplin'd and
inconstant: besides that the Aliment it self is
variously and unequally digested. Sometimes a
large Vein of nothing but pure Sulphur occurs,
and then the Fire becomes most furious on that
side. Afterwards perhaps succeeds a more Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick
sort of Earth, and then again it slackens
and languishes, at the same time, perhaps, gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ground on another more unctuous part, (in
consideration of which, we may now very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
expect, after so tedious an Extreme of
Wet and Windy Weather, the contrary Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
of Calm and Dry, at least for some time,
and in some of the Northern Climates:) and
in a word, as it encounters matter more or less
obnoxious to its force, it becomes more or less
violent. Thus it is likely that within these
Twelve or Fourteen Years past, it has met with
larger Magazines of the more combustible kind
under the Northern Regions of the Earth, by
the accension and advantage of which it is near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
arriv'd, and with much greater vehemence,
to the superficial part of the Northern World,
where causing those moist and phlegmatick Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
which it has from the beginning drove
up before it, together with what others were
properly and of course allotted to those superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Regions themselves, and also a large quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
out of the Ocean and Rivers to exhale, it
easily produces those Events, of which I shall
now give you a particular Account.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:94057:31"/>
And first, the perpetual and amazing Show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of Rain which of late have, for instance,
water'd our Island, arose primarily, we may
presume from this cause, in as much as by its
situation it is peculiarly liable to the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies
of Vapours discharg'd from the Ocean as
well as of others from it self. Hence it comes
to pass, that the Markets every where abound
with Complaints and Sighs no less than the
Hospitals; that a Vine leaf is as rare a thing as
once the Grapes; that Green passes for the most
fashionable Complexion amongst so many La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
that Physicians, of all people, gather most
Money next to the Collectors of the Taxes; and
that the Apothecaries get more by the Fruite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
than of old by the Wine-Coopers. For it
is hardly conceivable what a flight of Vapours
daily issues from under and about Great <hi>Britain,</hi>
which either being collected into Clouds, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
and directly fall in Showers, or else by
the Sun at the short intervals of his appearance
and action are rarified and deflected to the Pole,
whence when once gathered to a preponderous
Body they return, and become the material cause
of our extraordinary Showers of Rain, and Storms
of Wind. Nor does it follow hence that no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Wind could blow besides the North, for
the Collection of Vapours in revolving is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
and parted into a great many lesser Clouds,
which as they variously actuate one another,
and are actuated by the heat of the Sun, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
and move the Air differently, and often ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
it to change its course, especially where high
Rocks and Mountains obstruct its passage. It
is no wonder therefore if the Sun be grown such
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:94057:32"/>
a stranger, when Fogs and Gloominess inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
so impregnably, that 'tis as much as he
can do to make a peeping-hole through 'em once
in a Month, and instead of fructifying barely
satisfie his Curiosity. Nor is this the Fate of
Great <hi>Britain</hi> only, though no Climate has
had a larger share on't: <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
Germany, Poland, Denmark, Swedeland,</hi> and
almost all Tracts of <hi>Europe</hi> to the North have
felt the same calamity. The Vintages on one
side seldom answering expectation, nor the
Crops on th' other: but over and above all Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses
of Rain and Wind they have suffer'd very
remarkably by terrible Tempests, Thunder,
and Lightning, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the destruction of Cattle,
Houses, Men, besides frequent and dreadfull
Earth-quakes. And these may be justly ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
to dry Exhalations, the matter of which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds
under those Regions, and is expell'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with the moist Vapours by the approach
of the Central Fire, through which means it
fortunes often that Lightning and Hail fall in
the same Tempest. For that Heat which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
from the accension of the dry Exhalations
in Thunder and Lightning cannot prevent the
congealing of the cold Vapours, which perhaps
are so intimately confederated and congeal'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand,
that the sudden and violent accension
of the Exhalations, instead of melting or disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
'em serves only to precipitate their Descent.
Accordingly, without the blind Salvo of Antipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristasis
many a funking Boor may have had his
Pipe lighted by a Flash this minute, and beat
out of his mouth by a Pellet of Frost the next.
In violent cases the concurrence of two contrary
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:94057:32"/>
extremes ought not always to be look'd upon
as a Paradox. Indeed without repugnancy the
very notion of violence ceases. Thus have I
brought you acquainted with my Hypothesis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to the strangeness of the seasons for so
many years past in most of the Northern Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates,
but shall not desert the argument yet,
till I have mention'd an observation or two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
my opinion: First, that the Eruptions
of <hi>Vesuvius</hi> and <hi>Aetna</hi> have within our last
twenty years been more violent than ever. To
give you a punctual History of them down
from that time would neither be edifying
nor entertaining, especially to one, who, I
make no doubt, is inquisitive at least after the
more general occurrences of the material World.
And many say the Pope has been so miserably
scar'd, that in order to their Pacification, he's
delegating half a dozen Cardinals to turn all the
<hi>Tuscan</hi> Sea into Holy Water. However what
dreadfull Effects such Enormities may have
wrought, is easie to be guess'd by recollecting
only the ancient Accounts that have been left
us of the latter of those Mountains, at a time
when 'twas far less furious, and amongst others,
that incomparable one of <hi>Virgil:</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>—Horrificis sonat Aetna ruinis, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               </q>
               <q>
                  <l>—Near the Shoar</l>
                  <l>With lowd Convulsions <hi>Aetna</hi>'s bowels roar.</l>
                  <l>Oft from its Iaws in tow'ring Vollies rowls</l>
                  <l>Thick sooty Night, with Show'rs of livid Coals.</l>
                  <l>Bright Spouts of wavy Flame it belches high,</l>
                  <l>Which with a lambent Summet court the Sky.</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="56" facs="tcp:94057:33"/>
From Earth's deep Womb its rushing Fire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends,</l>
                  <l>And off the noisy sides vast rooted Masses rends.</l>
                  <l>Oft it disgorges with a deaf'ning groan</l>
                  <l>Ribs of it self in Oar of scalding Stone.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This very description seems enough to shock
an ordinary Courage, but I am afraid even so
vast a Genius of Poetry, of whose Memory I ask
pardon for my injurious Translation, would
have found it exceed his power to form a just
design of it, as its condition is now. I cannot
tell what surer proof you would have of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominancy
of Central Fire, unless you were to
feel it your selves. Another observation that
not a little strengthens my Hypothesis is this,
That although a small share of your Fruits have
ripen'd to a due perfection, yet you have had
as great or greater shows in your Fields and
Gardens about the beginnings of the Summers
as formerly. The Blades have rose, and the
Ears multiplied most successfully. The Trees
for some Autumns have been almost over-loaden;
and abroad the Vineyards thick-hung. But the
main thing of all, a just Maturity has never or
very rarely follow'd Crude and green they have
prov'd at the best, and the Reliques of 'em con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
so upon the Boughs till the next hard
Frost mortifies the Stalks. Much the same for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
or rather a little better has come to the
Harvests. But how should your Springs and
Summers prove so promising, and your Autumns
so treacherous, unless the Central Fire were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
now more capable of assisting the Sun's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
during the two first Seasons, and invali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dating
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:94057:33"/>
it upon the return of the latter. A third
observation, and that my last of this kind may
be, that the Frosty Seasons are much longer
and severer, (the present Winter excepted)
than of old. It may look perhaps paradoxical
that the predominancy of the Central Fire
should be the cause of this: and yet it seems to
be so, though remotely; for the heat of the Sun
being by the means aforesaid excluded, the
Frosts on the Surface of the Earth must com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence
earlier, continue more intense, and end
much later, especially penetrating a great deal
deeper into the Collection of moist Vapours re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd
upon the Central Fire's approach toward
the Earth's Surface. Thus, what with Rain
and Floods one part of the year, and Ice and
Cold the rest, you may expect in time to see
your Country <hi>Holland compleat,</hi> and the next Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
believe me, shall all be Scaters. Then
perhaps the Physicians and Apothecaries may
blow their Fingers, and the Surgeons, grown so
poor since your Civil Wars, come once more into
play. But I have already been too tedious upon the
Efficient Causes of your unseasonable Weather,
and shall now directly pass to the Moral Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of it, in all respects as extraordinary as the
other, in the consideration of which I shall not
be so particular as I might, my term of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
from a better place being almost expir'd:
and besides the generality of Mankind had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hear the natural History of such Calamities
than any rebukes for deserving them; that is,
they would have their Curiosities satisfied with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

can be done. The bare recollection of such
Evils will necessarily beget horrour in those that
procur'd 'em, especially where the Provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
have been universal, as among you of this
Island, which, I believe, can vie with any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
under Heaven for Vice and Impiety. I
could be very prolix upon this Topick, but I
know 'twill be in vain, and I should purchase
nothing else by my admonishments, but to be
call'd a preaching, canting Shadow, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss'd
for a <hi>damn'd foolish Apparition, stop their
Vitals.</hi> If I were to cry, Repent, you'd answer
me, 'Tis time enough: If I tell you You're har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den'd,
ye excuse your selves by saying, 'Tis then
too late. Thus most ambidextrously ye keep on
the old pace; and to stop you in your Career
makes ye but the more impatient to be upon the
Wing again. The practical part of Religion,
I confess, had been laid aside long before my
time, yet our Faith stuck by us, and though we too
often made a may-game of the Ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
we retain'd a sincere Veneration for the
Creed. Yet that, in process of time is, it seems,
gone after the other, even from <hi>I believe in God,</hi>
to the <hi>Life Everlasting.</hi> In short, ye are once again
as true <hi>Saxons</hi> as <hi>Austin</hi> first found you, bating
the business of Idolatry: For yeare by this time
better vers'd in the Argument <hi>à Majori,</hi> than to
trouble your pates with any other, after ye have
deserted the true God. And were but your
Actions a little more <hi>Saxonick,</hi> 'twould be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
however of a Palliation. But ye scorn it.
Rapine, Oppression, Fraud, Rudeness, and
Treachery were detestable names to the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of them: And now a' days forsooth! these
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:94057:34"/>
are <hi>British</hi> Virtues. He that would live must
be eminent in one of them, and he that would
thrive, in all of them. Then here's the jest
on't i'th' upshot, that all these foul crimes must
be wrapt up in Hypocrisie; for ye dote so
wretchedly on your wickedness as to turn ev'n
impolitick in't, and keep the old trade of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simulation
on foot, when ye desire your Villai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
should be proclaim'd. Heretofore fine plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Pretences were of mighty use, because then
there was at least so much integrity abroad as
might often baffle and confound an open oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition;
but now 'tis high time, one would fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
to lay aside the Cloak, when a Rascal's sure
to be a loser, should he be mistaken for a Fair-dealer.

That you must never expect the Weather should

Possessors of it call by the name of right Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
or Reason, so could there not have been
a greater Curse inflicted on rational Beings than
if what they term right Reason were nothing
but Delusion and Infatuation: for beside that
Principle, which is unalienable from a rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
Nature, of eschewing all Error as such,
the consequence would have been either, that
we must have pursu'd false Ends through sincere
Means, or real Ends through false Means, or
lastly false Ends through false Means; and the
effects of either of these had prov'd intolerable,
the more because the inconvenience would not
have attended two or three Counsels of our
Lives only, but all our Motions and Endeavours
whether of greater or less Importance: nay so
miserable had been our state, that if we could
have been sensible of it, no more comfort could
have been had than remedy; and if insensible,
the whole drudgery of the Delusion must have
been first entirely finish'd, e'er we could so much
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:94057:35"/>
as know we had taken such pains to be disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.
Annihilation were certainly more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible,
or at least not to be is as good as to be
in vain, for if an end is unattainable, it is all
one in the effect, as if there were no pursuant
to attain it. It nearly concerns us therefore, as
many as are conscious to our selves of possessing
this Principle, to examine the Pretences of it,
and whether it is infallible in all its Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
or only in some, and if but in some, which
they properly are: to inform himself whereof
I do not think it by any means necessary for a
man to strip off Flesh and Blood, to benumb
himself all over, to give his person the lye, to
close up his Eyes and forget his faculty of feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
For this is endeavouring to reduce him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to that sleeping state in which the great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visers
of this method suppose the most subtile
delusion. 'Tis a mere waking Dream, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
must undergo many a bitter pang before
she can wreath her self into the Monster. When
with half the trouble I can state a Principle or
an Axiom in my mind that shall be never the
worse for my being in my senses, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if they may not be credited, may however
be decently neglected. And although in the
formation of abstracted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ideas they often divert
and interrupt us, yet they are undoubtedly a
far greater hinderance when so much violence
is offer'd them. If lest to themselves they
might perhaps sometimes retard, or bring us
out of the way: they might interpose their
gross compounded Objects, and mix again those
simple Conceptions which the Understanding
has with much labour refin'd and sorted: they
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:94057:36"/>
might confound Notes of Discrimination with
Notes of Identity, reverse general Ideas, and
detain us with the sensible Properties of Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual.
Nay further, they might counterfeit the
Species of Objects, and surprize and perplex us
with their Incoherences: yet if we attempt to
discipline and restrain them, much more utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to discard and null them, they grow twice as
troublesome, and instead of diverting the Mind
by fits as before, perfectly distract it, and find
it so much trouble in subduing and governing
them, that unless it were capable of more Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
than one at once, it cannot pursue the
contemplation of those Notices and Ideas, for
the more accurate perception of which it relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quishes
all the Benefit and Instruction of the
Senses. Thus for instance, when I take upon
me to abstract the individuating Properties
whereby this man differs from that, and he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
from a third, and so forward, in order to
constitute an Idea of such a number of Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
as are common to the whole College of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals,
which is the Idea of a Species, the
presence of any of those Individuals before our
eyes may solicit the Soul to return to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
Contemplation of it, or else the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
may of a sudden re-unite what the Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
had separated, may perversly range the
Concretes before it, and so retard the Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
but then if all these Individuals are to be
reduc'd to the State of a Species, and at the
same time our Faculties must be continually
upon the Watch, continually suppressing and
chastizing the Insolences of sense; if the Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
must look two ways at once, mark out her
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:94057:36"/>
Lines and form her Planes, while she repulses
a Sally; this would be hard service indeed, and
she would find her self at last necessitated to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
altogether one of the two, or atchieve but
half of either. And of this the <hi>Cartesians</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
eminent examples against themselves, who
endeavouring to form an Hypothesis in despite
to their Senses, meet with so violent an opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from them, that while they are disputing
the Field with them, and subjecting the Rebels
to the Understanding, the work of ratiocination
halts, and many times as soon as one Premise is
handsomely plac'd, a sudden strife of the Senses
for liberty shall commence, against which the
Understanding must make head, and after the
Fray is a little over, forgetting her self, she
presumes she had before laid down two Premis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and in that assurance demurs not to draw a
Conclusion: or perhaps, when she has stated
both her Premisses, the senses begin to heave,
and she must correct them, upon which she lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
the judgment she had pass'd upon the Ideas
of her Premisses, and so fetches a wrong Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
from them. Thus in essaying to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
the Immateriality of the Soul from the
Essence of it, as being contradistinct to that of
the Body, they propose to prove, that the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
may not exist, but the Soul must, and from
thence infer, that the Souls Essence cannot be
the same with the body's, and that therefore
the Soul cannot but be immaterial: now the
possibility of the Non-existence of their Bodies,
which at first they barely propos'd they present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after presum'd, which such curious and scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous
Reasoners could hardly have done, but
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:94057:37"/>
that by the untractableness of the Senses their
Intellect was so disturb'd and annoy'd, as upon
recollection to look upon that as warrantably
presum'd, which was but <hi>gratis</hi> suppos'd: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
it is made a foundation for a further
Conclusion, that the Soul is immaterial because
its Essence is distinct from the Bodies which is
material: and here again a short skirmish with
the Senses seems to have interven'd between
the Premisses and Conclusion, else it could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have been, that such cautious Philosophers
should derive the evidence of the latter from the
former, because if they had carry'd it along with
them, that at most they had but evinc'd the
possibility of their Body's not existing, and the
certainty of their Soul's existence, they could
never, unless for the reason I have now given,
have alledg'd it as a necessary consequence from
such Premisses, that the Essence of the Soul
and Body are contradistinct; since 'tis obvious
to every one who will faithfully connect these
Premisses with this Conclusion, and that in their
full and proper Sense and Extent, that if the
Body as truly exists as the Soul, they cannot
differ <hi>on the score of Existence,</hi> and that untill
the Existence of the Body can be prov'd utterly
false as well as questionable (not that I think
there are any grounds for attempting the latter)
it cannot be necessarily concluded from possible
Premisses, that the Essences of the Soul and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
are contradistinct, nor from that conclusion
as founded on such Premisses, that the Soul is
immaterial. The occasion of which and many
more mistakes in men so diligent and jealous
could be no other than the many Advocations
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:94057:37"/>
and Diversions they received from their Senses,
and therefore they ought to be a warning to us
not to pick any Quarrels with our Senses in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to the stating solid Principles, nor to hold
for an Axiom, that the Corruption of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
is the generation of Reason.</p>
            <p>And yet on the other hand it were not safe
with <hi>Epicurus</hi> to confide wholly on the Senses,
to yield an implicit assent to all their Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and to be directed either in the search of
Truth or Good solely by their conduct, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
I think there is no harm in being so
much a Stoick, as to impute those errors which
result from the Impressions of the Senses so
long as they keep their natural Disposition and
Tenor) not to the Organs, but to the Objects:
however as long as between the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we are in some cases liable to be deceiv'd,
a wise man would use their assistance warily, and
be sure to look upon them as bare instruments,
not free Agents: for we are naturally dispos'd
to commit our selves to all determinations in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently
of a free Agent, and no less ready
by reason of so near a relation between them to
confound the Senses with the Intellect, being
very prone to be guilty of the same Metonymies
in the common cases of Life. Thus the Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
himself will tell you that his Pencil will <hi>draw</hi>
a small Line, and such Drugs will <hi>make</hi> a good
Colour if mixt together; the Countryman that
his Plow-share <hi>cuts</hi> the Glebe; and the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
that his Crook <hi>pulls</hi> his Sheep: and this
way of speaking being familiar to us when we
talk of the instruments of Mechanicks, we have
unfortunately contracted a habit of expressing
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:94057:38"/>
our selves by the same figure when we discourse
of those instruments of our Understanding, the
Senses: which we are also the more easily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd
to through our not observing what I
mention'd before, the true nature and just
bounds of the relations between our Senses and
Understanding. But when we consider them
as instruments only, we regard them proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably,
we decline all assent to them till such
time as circumstances are weigh'd, and all those
conditions answer'd, without which their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
is exceptionable; such are the suitable
Site and Distance of the Object, the due Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament
of the Organ, the thickness or rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Medium, and the like. So when a
Mountain appears a Cloud, the distance of the
Object is to be enquir'd; when the colour of
the Plumes varies on the neck of the Dove, the
nature of the Medium, when the Snow seems
yellow, the disposition of the Organ: and when
all these conditions are duly examin'd, we shall
learn what grounds we have to assent, and by
becoming acquainted with the defects of our
Senses be able to form judgments as certain from
them in cases wherein they are faulty, as in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
wherein they are faithfull: for if we can tell
what is wanting to the perfection of a thing, we
cannot but know withal the true state of that
thing while under such an imperfection as clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as if that imperfection were away, we should
know the state of the same thing in its perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
an instance of this is that choice one among
the Academicks of an Oar half under water, of
whose real Figure, notwithstanding so plausible
an appearance, I can as confidently judge as if
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:94057:38"/>
the whole were out of the Water, seeing I know
my eye to be in that case incapacitated to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to my mind the true state of the Object,
and withal understand how far and wherein its
representation deviates from a just one: whence
I can deduce sure Inferences either in relation to
that appearance which I know to be false, or to
that state of the Object which I know to be real.
But beside this, another Discipline no less per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
has obtain'd as generally almost among
the Learned as the former among the Plebeians,
of confounding the Senses one with another, a
miscarriage occasion'd by that admir'd Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem,
That all the Senses are concluded in that
one of feeling, which by an easie consequence
disposes us to believe it necessary that whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
affects us by one sense, would, if in like
manner apply'd to the Organs of our other Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
affect them also, and that therefore when
an Object has past the Test of one, there is no
further need to examine it by the rest, because
all are affected after one manner, so that if any
thing acts upon my Faculty of seeing, it ought
to be a sufficient evidence, that it is in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the same to act as effectually upon my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
of hearing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> till at length we come to
imagine that whatsoever our Eyes represent to
us under the Figure of a Palpable Substance, is
in it self such. Thus while some Philosophers
have beheld the Azure of the Sky, they have
been mov'd to fansie it a solid Arch compacted
as it were of Blew Stone, or some such kind of
matter, whence arose that wild System of solid
Orbs, by which the Ancients made a mere Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-mill
of the Heavens; although I confess we
are not so often by this means deceiv'd in the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:94057:39"/>
general intrinsick properties of Substances, as
in their external modifications, in the discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of which we should not behave our selves so
like Infants, if we would not so often rely upon
the Authority of one Sense for the certainty of
that which can only be prov'd by another Sense.
How often have we known wise people scar'd
with the lustre of <hi>Phosphorus,</hi> rotten Wood,
and stinking Fish, only because they suppos'd
such an Affinity between the Senses, that if one
receiv'd such an Influence from its Object as is
proper to that Sense, the other would also up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
trial receive those Influences from the same
Object which are proper to them? Now where
these two Rules are observ'd, that we look on
the Senses as bare instruments, and that we do
not confound them one with another, I think
we may safely trust to and rely upon them, for
the first will prevent our assenting too soon, and
the latter will be a means of knowing when it
is time.</p>
            <p>But the most simple way of reasoning is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
the best; for although the Authority of
the Senses is not to be utterly rejected, nay, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it is for the most part to be receiv'd;
yet if more simple evidence can be had, the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
is doubly gratified, and the Will by
far more plyant; for evidence is as precious to
the one, as it is prevalent upon the other: the
first is not capable of any clearer information,
nor the latter of a stronger impression. Whence
it comes to pass, that it is impossible for a man to
be a <hi>Sceptick.</hi> He may indeed affect the name,
but cannot be the thing: because when he would
seem to deny an Axiom, he must be understood
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:94057:39"/>
to want evidence, and to have it at the same
time: to want it, because he says so, and to
have it, because he can bring no other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for his not having it than a bare denying
of it, which is none at all. 'Tis true indeed,
every man knows best how he feels himself af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
at any time, but if his Neighbour find it
out of his own power to evade the force of such
and such a proposition, he may assure himself
that the same proposition can be no more eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by the Pretender to Scepticism than by
himself, unless he believes that Pretender's Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
and Will to be of a quite different
constitution from his own, or else that such a
Pretender is endow'd with neither, or deny'd
the use and liberty of them, or last of all that
the Pretender's faculties transcend his own, and
that by vertue of a more sublime apprehension
he understands that to be false, which to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
appears necessarily true. In one of these
three conditions the Pretender must be, if he
can really within his own breast deny the truth
of an Axiom that is properly such: for if his
Faculties be exactly of the same kind and extent
with his Neighbours, it is impossible but what
affects those of the latter in such a certain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
must affect those of the former in the
same degree, seeing where the cause is one, and
the Patients on which an Effect is to be
wrought by that Cause are the very same in
kind, the Effect must also be the same: for else
two different Effects could be produced, <hi>caeteris
paribus,</hi> by the same Cause, which in a Cause
suppos'd to move at least one of the two Patients
fatally and inevitably as soon as addressed to that
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:94057:40"/>
Patient (and such is the self-evidence of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to the Faculties of the Pretenders
Neighbour in our case) cannot be, because if
address'd to one of the Patients it unavoidably
begets in it such an Effect, it must as unavoidably,
when address'd to another Patient, perfectly
the same, beget in it the same Effect: otherwise
its Effect would be necessary and yet not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
which the Pretender's Neighbour knows
of himself cannot be true, nor can the Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's
faculties be of a different kind, provided
they be of the same extent as his Neighbour's,
(for if they are larger or narrower, we are to
consider them as supposed to be such afterwards)
because there can be no Species of Rational Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
distinct in Essence and Nature from his
own, for whoever has a power of Apprehending,
of Judging, of Concluding Coequal with his,
must apprehend, judge and conclude as he does,
for if he have distinct powers equivalent to these,
he must apprehend, judge and conclude by the
help of those powers in the same degree as his
Neighbour, and if he cannot, his powers are not
equivalent, and are therefore to be consider'd,
when we shall speak of them as suppos'd less.
Do his Faculties therefore differ from ours on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in order? that is, Does he judge before he
apprehends? or conclude before he judges? in
that respect again, his Rational Powers will be
inferiour to his Neighbour's, and therefore they
cannot be of a different kind from those of the
latter, and equivalent to them. Neither may
they be superiour, since if they surpass the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever's
either in alacrity of Perception, strength
of Judgment, or security of Ratiocination,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:94057:40"/>
which is what I mean by Superiour, instead of
disbelieving what his Neighbour cannot but
assent to, his knowledge of it must be more
clear and ample, and his conviction much ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
than his Neighbour's, who assisted with
that poor capacity that he is endow'd with,
finds himself oblig'd to acknowledge the truth
of manifest Axioms, and plainly perceives that
they cannot be false: how much rather then
must the Pretender be sensible of their evidence,
being assisted with Faculties so much larger and
perfecter, in as much as that which approves
its own certainty to Faculties less capable of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
it, must approve it no less, for the
reasons already alledg'd, where we demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it impossible, that Faculties exactly of the
same kind and extent should be alike affected by
the same Impressions, to Faculties more capable
of apprehending it? Nay, must over and above
approve it self so much the more effectually to
them, as they are degrees more apprehensive
of it than the less capable: for carrying in it
self the unquestionable tokens of truth, so that
as soon as it reaches the apprehension, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
the judgment, it cannot offer it self to
a more eminent apprehension, but it must be
more intimately known to it, nor convince at
the same time a clearer Judgment, but with a
proportionably greater evidence. For notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
that evidence which convinces the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senter
be to him so clear, that nothing can be
clearer, yet it is not to be doubted but that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
more exquisite can more readily conceive
and easily entertain such evidence. However
it is sufficient for us, if the evidence but equally
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:94057:41"/>
convince both. But may not the Pretender's
Faculties be inferiour? May they not be fewer?
May they not be less perfect? And indeed it
seems a difficult matter to prove him a Master
of Right Reason, who declares himself proof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the first Principles of it. In this security
it is that the Pretenders hug themselves. It
looks like an errant Impossibility, that their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
should lie thus naked and expos'd to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Body's else. But they are deceiv'd, and as
little able to conceal their own abilities as they
are averse. The disguise will not stick on long
enough for them to enter upon their part, but
betrays them e'er the very first act. For the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senter
knowing by himself that first Principles
or Axioms exercise only the Judgment or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Operation of the Mind, and terminate in
it, may resolve himself, that if that Operation
is in the Pretender's power, he cannot but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
the certainty of those Axioms which
of themselves and antecedently to any Ratioci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
imprint a security of their Truth, and
that this Operation is in the Pretender's power,
himself evinces, when he forms that Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by which he declare himself unaffected with
the evidence of those Axioms; for he who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
that this thing can be predicated of that
thing, is oblig'd to such an act of examining
the relation between one Idea and another, as
we call Judgment, and furthermore by exerting
this Act demonstrates himself to have the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of assenting or dissenting, seeing he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
such a relation to be between one Idea and
another, or affirms that there is no such relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
between them, expresses by that very act an
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:94057:41"/>
assent to the latter proposition, or a dissent to
the former. Nor matters it any thing whether
this act be called an Act of Assent or Dissent,
for either of them consists in a <hi>Persuasion</hi> of
Mind, be that Persuasion either of the one kind
or of the other. He therefore that pronounces
a Proposition in which he denies the truth of
another Proposition, at the same time signifies
his Persuasion, and no more than both these ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities
is requisite to the being such a Patient
as the Assenter's first Principles or Axioms when
offer'd, necessarily affect in such a manner and
degree. But suppose the Pretender is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded
of what he pronounces. If he is not, then
he is either persuaded of the contrary, and so
becomes one with the Assenter, or is altogether
unaffected, or at best but dubiously with either
Proposition, and neglects or discredits no less
what himself pronounces than what the Assenter
pronounces. But this he cannot do, as being
qualified to pronounce such a judgment, for in
pronouncing it he unites and divides Ideas ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his own choice, and <hi>choosing</hi> to unite
this Idea with that, or divide it from it, is an
Act of Assent or Distent. Unless therefore the
Pretender, when he pronounces his Judgment
is suppos'd to be acted by a blind Principle, and
his words to be no more than sounds form'd
by a fatal motion of the Organs of Speech, not
the Interpreters of an Intelligent Being, (which
being suppos'd, we make the Pretender uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of being a Sceptick as much as before, for if
he is only a blind unintelligent Nature, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
perceive in himself an indifference to the
force of the Proposition in which consists his
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:94057:42"/>
Scepticism) the whole extravagant Mask drops
off o'course. Not that if he could keep it on
ever so long, the Assenter is concern'd to force
him to common sense against his Will so long as
himself is sincerely satisfied of the truth of such
undenyable Propositions, and upon Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of this kind, we now purpose to proceed.</p>
            <p>The Propositions which I shall expect to be
granted me, are these two,
<list>
                  <item>Whatsoever affects, has a being.</item>
                  <item>Whatsoever is affected, has a Being.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Nor will I yet dare to assume them, although
clear enough by their own light, without as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing
just reasons for so doing. The truth of
the first is no way to be question'd, if that which
assects can affect only by application of it self to
that which is affected, and this it must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
do either immediately to that which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
affected by it, or by communication of
other intermediate Afficients. And more certain
nothing can be, than that That which is nor can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
so apply it self. As necessarily also must eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing that is affected in any manner exist, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that in order to be affected, it must be such
a Patient as is capable of receiving and sustain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Afficient when it applies it self, which
a mere Negative cannot be. And this without
reducing the matter to any Axioms of the Schools
cannot but be so far convictive.</p>
            <p>Seeing therefore I am conscious to my self of
being in the number of those things which find
themselves affected, I am certain, that I truly
and really exist, and that not only as to that
part of me which is a Judge of the reality of
my being affected, but as to that part also
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:94057:42"/>
which is only capable of being affected, not of
being a Judge of it, because whether the latter
part, by which I design the purely sensitive part,
is or is not consummated but by the former or
purely cogitative part, a question which might
admit of a long dispute if it were necessary, it
is certain, that I am truly and properly affected
in both parts. That I am affected in the first,
the very doubting of it evidently proves, much
more, as I have already shewn, the denying of
it; it being impossible, but that he which su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spends
his Judgment, must find himself no less
affected by the matter of his suspense, than if it
were become the subject of his Assent or Dissent,
for although it does not affect him so as proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the event to dispose or determine his Will,
yet it makes him equally sensible of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
and application of such matter, as the
same would do, if become a Subject of his As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
or Dissent: which it does, as has already
been evinc'd when such matter passes once into
an Affirmation or Negation. And because that
Operation of the cogitative part, by which it
conceives the certainty of its being affected, is
indeed a Judgment consisting of an Idea of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
either in general or special, the thing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
and the act of affecting, for whoever
conceives thus much of himself, <hi>I am affected,</hi>
must apprehend such a thing as Affection impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the word Affected, something also affected
declar'd by the person I; and lastly, the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the former to the latter: and seeing
that there is no man, whether he doubts, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms,
or denies, (and one of these three every
man as to his cogitative part must do) but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:94057:43"/>
or feels the certainty of his being affected,
it necessarily follows, that that portion of the
cogitative part truly exists, which exerts the
Act call'd Judgment, and not this only, but
because (which has been prov'd above) in all
Acts of Judgment is compriz'd an Assent or
Dissent, and these appertain to the Will, that
the Faculty of the Will no less truly exists.
And as for the Imagination and Memory, the
first of them consisting in simple apprehension is
so contain'd in the Faculty of Judgment, that
it is evident he who is possest of the latter, must
be as truly endow'd with the former, but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
those Sensibles about which this Faculty is
conversant be true and sincere, we shall present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
examine. The Memory is indeed all consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
being no more than a power of resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the perception of Affections already past,
but so far as it is distinct from simple apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or Judgment, it is no more than a bare secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of having receiv'd such and such Impressions;
which security where ever it is lodg'd, is its own
Testimony, and he that has it cannot but know
he has it, because if he denies he has it, he must
form to himself such a Judgment, as will evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
shew that he has it, for in forming such
a Judgment, he must, in the first place, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
himself as the subject of which he denies
such an Attribute to be predicable, then the
Attribute it self; and lastly the extent of relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
between them, so that unless he can conceive
all these together, he must have it, which yet
he cannot conceive together, because if he could,
a due order of Succession in the terms of such a
Judgment were not absolutely necessary, both
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:94057:43"/>
the Relatives and the Relation between them
being <hi>so</hi> to be conceiv'd at the same instant as
any one of them: Whereas such a Judgment
cannot be form'd as shall consist of fewer terms
than these, nor the dependance of these terms
pronounc'd, unless they be dispos'd in a certain
due order and succession. The necessity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of such a succession being thus evinc'd, it
appears, that he who denies himself to have
Memory, must consider himself being the first
term in such a Judgment, not with the other
terms in the same instant of Conception, but as
the first of the line and the others in their order
distinctly afterwards, and when he has reflected
upon each of them, must to perfect the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
compare and weigh the relation of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
with the Subject, which is not to be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
without restoring that Perception or Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
of the Subject wherewith he was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
when in the order of his Reflections he
first consider'd that subject as the first term of
the Judgment, and this is Memory. The
same argument will hold, if instead of denying he
pretends to doubt whether he has Memory or
not, for I cannot conceive within my self thus
much, <hi>I doubt of such a thing,</hi> but by a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in which the case is all one as before:
Thus the certainty of the Existence of all the
Faculties or Portions of the cogitative part of
me is demonstrated upon the foregoing Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and consequently of the whole. Many
more arguments might be fetch'd to inforce
these now alledg'd; but perhaps one is more
than necessary, nothing being more out of the
power of a thinking Being than in good earnest
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:94057:44"/>
to persuade it self that it is no Being. Nay
even supposing it possible that it should be veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
persuaded that it has no Being, it cannot but
when it feels it self so persuaded, be at the same
juncture assur'd that it really is; so that while
I suppose such a thing possible, I must suppose
it impossible, and that being a direct contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
cannot be true; therwise the Principles so
lately granted might be true and not true, and
whatsoever affects or is affected be and not be.
We are therefore next to examine whether there
is the same security of the real Existence of the
sensitive part, and this upon the same Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.
Certain it is that I perceive my self af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
as well in this part as in the other, but
whether or no this Perception is intirely owing
to the cogitative part, or cannot be wrought
without the intervention of Organs external to
that and Corporeal, may by some Scepticks be
offer'd as matter of Dispute, because if such
Perception can be effected without such Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Organs, those Organs may be no more than
mere Phantom, Emptiness and Delusion; and
on the other hand, if it cannot be effected but
by such External Organs, those Organs must
be both distinct from the thinking part, and as
properly existent as that. To proceed therefore
regularly, it is necessary that we contemplate what
those Affections are which are proper to the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
part, and whence they arise. In themselves
they are such as can only inhere in, and arise
from Beings extended; of which we shall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
prove that by the laws of its nature it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be other. Nor is the consequence of this
Demonstration to be evaded, for if these Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:94057:44"/>
of the sensitive part can only inhere in an
extended Being, and arise from the Essential
Properties of an extended Being; and if all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Beings must be real, the sensitive part
must therefore be real and truly distinct from a
Being uncapable by it self of receiving <hi>immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
those impressions unless in a far more imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
manner, which it ultimately receives and
consummates by vertue of the Affections be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to that External Being which consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
the sensitive part, provided it be also de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated,
that that Being which constitutes
the cogitative part is indeed uncapable by it self
of receiving <hi>immediately</hi> those Impressions, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
in a far more imperfect manner. And this
I question not but to perform in its proper place.
In the mean while to prove that the Affections
of the sensitive part only inhere in, and are
proper to an extended Being: I think the first
thing to be done is to enquire what they are,
and that by Particulars according to the vulgar
Division of them, by which they are distributed
into the five external Senses, and the common
internal: where yet it ought to be remembred
that external is not oppos'd as before, to a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Incorporeal, seated within the External,
but to an extended one (extended so far as it is
properly sensitive, as shall be hereafter shewn)
more External with respect to the Incorporeal
Being than what is here call'd internal. The
first of these is the power of perceiving the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensions
and Complexions of Objects, both
which are proper to no Beings but what are
extended, for all Dimensions whether incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat,
as a Point, Line, or Superficies; or
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:94057:45"/>
compleat, as Prosundity in conjunction with
the former, cannot be conceiv'd but in a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
capable of such Dimensions: not but in
more abstracted Speculations those Dimensions
may be contemplated without particular regard
had to the Subject of them, but if we consider
them in the relation which they bear to a Being
extended, we shall easily learn how inseparable
they are from it, and therefore how necessarily
that Being wherein such Dimensions are found
is extended; and again it is no less evident that
Objects carrying Complexion or Colour must
be also extended, because all Colour, whether
it arises from the Modification of the superficial
parts of a Body; or whether it be what the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotelians</hi>
call a Form, (if indeed they are to
be distinguish'd) or whatever its Essence is, <hi>must
be co-extended with a Superficies,</hi> insomuch
that when the Intellect abstracts it from a real
Superficies, it cannot be conceiv'd any otherwise
than circumscrib'd and expanded to certain
Bounds and Limits on all sides as a Superficies,
and because it cannot be conceiv'd without the
Dimensions of a Superficies, nor a Superficies
out of a Being extended, supposing, as I said
before, we consider both the former, in the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which they bear to the latter; we cannot
but conclude that Colour or Complexion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it is found, must be in a Body truly and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
extended. I say therefore, as Dimension
and Complexion are proper to no Beings but
what are extended, and from these inseparable;
so we are also sure, that the sensitive part, by
which we obtain the Perception of these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
is it self extended, because thus much is
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:94057:45"/>
certain, that either the Intellect by its <hi>intuitive</hi>
Faculty does <hi>immediately</hi> obtain these Impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Dimension and Colour, or if not, either
it must receive them from the Objects them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
without the Interposition of any other
extended Being, or by the conveyance of some
other, unless it be granted that some other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporeal
Being is the Author of this commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication;
and then that as being an Afficient or
Operator must exist, if a Finite, independence
on, and by vertue of an Infinite, as the sequel
shall demonstrate; if an Infinite, so much
therefore of our Argument is made good with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
further study. Now the utmost our Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuals
can archieve by their intuitive Faculty
of it self, is to feign an Object to be, and to be
present, not to perceive it properly as real and
present. It can form an Idea of Dimension in
general, or any one kind of Dimension, as also
of Colour in general, or any particular sort of
Colour, but then this Idea shall be variable at
pleasure; the Dimensions shall be larger or less,
of this Form or that Form, and the complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this kind or that kind, as the Soul plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
whereas the Figure and Colour of those
Objects which affect us, as to what we call
sight, are not in our Power nor Subject to that
Faculty which can vary those particular Dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
and Colours it self has form'd at discretion.
These latter affect us without any antecedent
counsel or resolution of the Soul, whereas the
Faculty of Imagination cannot set to work with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being first determin'd by a plain Act of the
Will: so I cannot beget in my self the Perce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
of any figure without a motion first made
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:94057:46"/>
in my Soul to form such a Conception, and a
tacit consent also to pursue that motion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
we often find that Figures and Colours too
surprize us, and are not, as in other cases,
to be remov'd or chang'd at the decree of our
Will. Seeing therefore they affect us, and not
by our own procurement, and seeing the varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them does not depend on our own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
'tis evident they must so far, as things
are so and so figur'd and colour'd, be distinct
from them, because whatsoever is figur'd and
colour'd, must, as has been shewn above, be
extended; and that the Faculties of the Soul
cannot be, as shall be shewn hereafter: altho'
if they could, it would avail nothing against
us, as shall be also shewn hereafter. Nor mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
it as to the question in hand, whether that
which appears to be just so and so figur'd and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour'd,
really is so, but whether it only appears
in such a manner to be so figur'd and colour'd as
that by the power of my Intellectual Faculties
I cannot make it otherwise, and as that it offers
it self unsought and unlook'd for so dispos'd. <hi>Esse</hi>
and <hi>apparere</hi> in this case are one, and if we are
not able to vary these Dimensions and Colours
which affect us, though they may not perhaps
truly and properly, as they are of such a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
kind belong to such a Subject, it is De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
as they are Dimensions and Colours
in general, they exist in some extended Being
distinct from my Intellectuals. And by this
Principle it is easie to solve those Difficulties
which may be started concerning Dreams and
Lunacy, for although those Difficulties, if ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
are not, as the <hi>Cartesians</hi> and <hi>Malbran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chians</hi>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:94057:46"/>
have surmiz'd, any valid Objections or
Exceptions to general rules of certainty of the
Senses, it being very sufficient, if they are at
such certain times, and on such certain occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
true, when by particular attention they
have been found to be so, because indeed, any one
instance <hi>for us</hi> justly pursu'd to the Consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
we fetch from it, is of force to confirm all
that we shall contend for, yet because no room
for cavil should be left; I think upon these terms
it is apparent, that as to the general properties
of the Objects of Sense, they are as faithfully
represented to our Senses in our Dreams as at
other times. The Subjects of those Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
'tis true, are not in reality present, but
those Impressions which were a little before
made upon the Organs hold good, and affect
the Soul when no longer diverted by impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which though weaker, and therefore una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to destroy the more durable, do, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
while an entrance is open for them, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the Soul's being affected with any other.
Now it is absolutely necessary that these impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of such long continuance made upon the
sensitive part, be either made by that, <hi>of it self,</hi>
or else by Objects of the sensitive part; if by it
self, and it be prov'd, as it shall, extended and
distinct from the thinking part by arguments un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyable
in themselves, and fetch'd from diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
instances, the Objection leaves us as to this
part of it in the same place where it found us:
if by Objects of the sensitive part, no more is
requir'd than to prove from instances more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and unquestionable, and indeed most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that all Objects of the sensitive part must
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:94057:47"/>
be extended, which leads us again back to our
general rules. And indeed, unless the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
evidently carry'd in it such a repugnancy to
our general Rules, as that it could not be sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable
upon the Suppositions made by us in them,
let it be never so difficult to be accounted for in
it self, it avails nothing against the force of those
general rules: for granting it be solvable upon
those Suppositions, as to what we are concern'd
for in it the possiblity of its Being so is equally
consistent with our general Rules of certainty,
as they are principles from which such and such
Conclusions are to be brought; as if the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
had been ever so easily solvable in those
Questions which may be started about it consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
in it self, so that it is to no purpose to
urge, How do I know but my senses may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
me, when I'm awake, as well as when I'm
asleep? because, although perhaps the true and
real manner of their so affecting and disposing
us as we find they or their Objects, or some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
like what we mean by them does, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to us, yet I can assure my self, that for
ought I perceive of them (and I can judge no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all of them beyond that, unless by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Rules of certainty) that we should be affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
after such a manner by them, is not only
consistent with our general Rules of certainty
of the Senses, but altogether conformable to
them, and more than a probable Argument of
that which we are presently to evince, that the
Organs of Sense are distinct from the thinking
part no less than the Object. Indeed we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
say, but the Objection may prove that for
such Objects to be just then present, when as in
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:94057:47"/>
a Dream, we really imagine them to be so, is
not absolutely necessary; but it cannot infer that
Objects properly and truly such, at least with
respect to their general Properties, such as we
in such circumstances take them to be, need not
at one time or other to have been really pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent:
perhaps too, these general properties
might not then have been united as in my Dream,
suppose of a Chimaera; but one in one Object
might have made deeper impressions than any
other in the same Object, and another in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but that alters not the case supposing, as
we experience when awake, the Soul has a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of joyning and mixing these selected parts
and properties. And all this, according to the
common Notion of the Origin of Dreams,
which, as I have said already, whether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant
to these or those Physical Principles or
not, most certainly suffice to account for all
those difficulties which at present concern us
with relation to certainty of the Senses,
and therefore the Objection grounded upon
those difficulties stands no longer in the way of
our general Rules. And as for the manner
how the Impressions of Objects are so fasten'd
upon the Organs, as to affect them after so long
a time, we are as much excus'd from searching
into that, as into the manner of Objects moving
our Organs when we are awake. It is enough,
if by our general Rules we become sure that at
both times they truly act so upon us. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
since only Bodies have obtain'd those
general Qualities which the Soul perceives her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
affected with, as from those Bodies; and
since, as we shall prove hereafter, the Soul her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:94057:48"/>
is a Being unextended, it cannot be, that the
Soul should be so affected, as to the Perception
of those general Qualities, unless by such Beings
as have only obtain'd them, and those are Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies:
I say, as to the Perception of those gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Qualities, as Colour and Dimension in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
not the particular dispositions or sorts of
them, as whether the Object wherein I am
sure is Colour and Dimension in general be
Red or Green, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Crooked or Streight. For
here, though not often, we sometimes may err,
as in the particular Colours of a Prism or the
figure of a stick half under Water. Wherein
yet we may know by the Rules of certainty al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
laid down, that there really is Colour
and Dimension in general, and that therefore
their Subjects are Beings truly and properly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended:
so that whether awake or asleep, those
general properties of extended Beings which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
us must be lodg'd in Beings truly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
extended, which is as much as serves for
our present purpose, although even supposing
the Soul to be material, if it be one solid Piece
of matter, it cannot be affected, as by proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of extended Beings, unless by the applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a Being truly extended to its own Superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies;
or if it consists of many parts of matter,
either each part (whether it be mov'd or not
mov'd) must be endow'd with the power of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
such properties, or only certain of them:
if each part, the same application either of some
other part of it, which in respect of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
part, is no more than its Object; or of
some extended Being distinct from all parts of
the Soul is still necessary to affect in such a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:94057:48"/>
because no part of matter can be affected
with such Qualities as are proper to Matter,
but by receiving the Impressions of them from
some other portion of Matter. And this must
be, ev'n supposing such Matter to perceive by
a perceptive Quality unknown to us, for if it
be a perceptive Quality at all, it must be such
an one as we make the Soul to have, supposing
it immaterial, and consequently subject to
the same Laws as are proper to the other. Nor
shall we, I hope, need to say any more as to
this Objection in our Examination of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Senses. To proceed then, as the Soul can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
by her intuitive Faculty alone, so perceive
these Objects of Sight, as she finds she does per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
unalterable by and independent on her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties;
so cannot the immediate application of
the Object to her Faculties effect those Perce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions
without the commerce of extended Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans:
and here we have two things to prove,
That the Soul cannot perceive those general pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
of extended Beings distinct from her self,
but by the intervention of extended Instruments
united to her by the most intimate Union, that
an unextended and extended Being are capable
of, and that these Objects are by no means so
united: from whence it plainly follows, that
there are other extended Instruments by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,
of which the Soul perceives those ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
properties, and these we shall prove to be
the Senses. Now the most intimate Union that
can be between unextended and extended Beings
is of Composition; for that which is extended,
allotting it never so many occult properties, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be unextended while 'tis extended; and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:94057:49"/>
the most intimate Union of Composition is, when
one of the Beings united cannot be affected, but
the other must be affected also; supposing the
Beings united to be consider'd as passive which
we have already shewn the Soul, when she per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
the general properties of Objects, as in
the Objects must be, and therefore whatever is
united to her by a most intimate Union of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
if such an Union, as I understand,
be a most intimate, must with her be passive
too. And indeed those things which cannot
have one Being in common, can be no nearer
united than necessarily to affect or be affected in
common; since whatsoever is not essentially uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to any thing else, must be essentially distinct
from it, and whatsoever cannot be conceiv'd
without its Extension, as all extended Beings
(whether in that Extension consists their Essence
or not) must be essentially distinct from whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
cannot be conceiv'd with Extension, which
we have promis'd already to prove hereafter of
the Soul; and whatsoever is essentially distinct
from any thing else, can obtain no nearer an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance
than that of acting and suffering with it:
So as that in the latter case, the one cannot be
affected but the other must be affected also, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
when one is passive, the other may be active:
but that cannot be, for in order to this, they
must be so far disunited as that one, <hi>viz.</hi> the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Being must, in cases of Sensation alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
specified, affect the other by an extrinsecal
Impression, or such an Impression as must imply,
that that which impresses is no more united to
that which is impressed upon, than the Object
of Sense is to the perceptive Faculty of the Soul,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:94057:49"/>
and that's not at all, for the properties of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mension
and Complexion in those Objects could
not be perceiv'd, as in a distinct and separate
State from that which perceives them, in which
yet, for reasons lately alledg'd, they cannot but
be, unless they were at least so far divided from
it, as that it should not be united to their Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies,
which it is impossible for it to be, while it
plainly perceives that Superficies to be <hi>extra se,</hi>
and withal, that it cannot be ty'd nearer to any
Superficies, with the Perception of which it is
as distinctly affected, as with that of an Object,
than at most, barely to be surrounded by it,
which is far from any Union of Composition.
Not yet can the application of the Object's Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies
to the perceptive Faculty, without the
intervention of extended Organs united to the
perceptive Faculty by the most intimate Union
of Composition, produce such a Perception, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the utmost that the Imagination of her
self can effect, is, as was observed before, to
feign Objects real and present; nor can the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies
of the Object, by approaching only,
dispose that Faculty which is not else dispos'd
to take any notice of it; for unless that Object
can so affect the perceptive Faculty, as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
in it that real Perception of it self, which
the Faculty is no more than able to feign, it's
approach conduces not at all to the begetting
such a Perception: and thus much it is certain
it cannot, unless there be, at least, in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Object, a power of exciting, which pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
must either subsist in it independantly of it,
or as an accident move and operate only in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
with its Subject: not the first, because
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:94057:50"/>
this power being on such conditions, an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Being must beget still that Perception,
either by the approach of that extended Being,
which is its Subject, or by it self: the one it is
no more able to do, than the extended Being
approaching the perceptive Faculty without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
such assistant, nor yet by it self, because un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
it has in it self the Notices or Perceptions
of such general properties of an extended Being,
it cannot by a mere confus'd and blind Sollicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
cause our perceptive Faculty to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
such general Properties, which consider'd
(as we consider it now) in it self, it has not,
and consequently cannot move us to take notice
of them, and therefore the perceptive Faculty
does by other means receive those distinct and
clear Impressions of Dimension, Colour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
than by that which has them not in it self, nor
yet effects those Impressions by the means of that
which has such properties in it self. But then,
supposing it only an accident, it's effect cannot
exceed that of its Subject, <hi>viz.</hi> a bare brute ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Being; and by the mere accession of this,
which yet is all the Operation conceivable in a
bare brute extended Being, the immaterial Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
can be no more affected, than if the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Being had not approach'd, no more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Faculty, as has been prov'd above,
than at most to feign the Object real and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent;
nor any vertue in the immediate impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the extended Being, by which alone it can
procure a Perception of its own general proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in the perceptive Faculty. Because there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the accession of the Object cannot produce
a Perception of its general properties in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty;
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:94057:50"/>
nor the Faculty by her-self form those
independant and distinct Perceptions which she
has of Objects, some other extended Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
more intimately united, are requisite to
the begetting such a Perception, and these are
the Organs of Sense, which are more sensibly
and closely united, than that those general pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties,
by which we know Objects to be distinct
from the Faculty, are so by the Faculty to be
perceiv'd in them. And the same security we
have for the rest of the Externals, Hearing, Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting,
Smelling, and Feeling, of the last more
especially, because in it we are affected after
such a manner, as to perceive those general pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
peculiar to the Sensation of this Sense,
as Dimension, (which is common with this
Sense to that of Seeing) Hardness, Softness,
Roughness, Smoothness, and the like; and
which are not to be found, but in a truly extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Being, as in two distinct Superficies, that
of the Organ reaching the Object, and that of
the Object pressing the Organ, an evident
Demonstration upon those Principles we have
already laid down, as well of the certainty of
both their Extensions, as of their being distinct
from each other. But this, with the other
three Externals, I shall leave (for brevity sake)
to be examin'd by the Discipline of Certainty
already offer'd, and therefore offer'd in general
terms; declining particularly the discussion of
the three other Senses, because all the Objects
of them are primarily Objects of the other two;
and as to those general properties which are as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signable
to them, as Tast in general, Sound in
general, Odour in general, fall under the same
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:94057:51"/>
Doctrines with the former; only this may be
necessary to observe once again, that the surest
means of escaping error, is to try and judge on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of those properties which the Judgment shall,
by due methods understand to be appropriated
to each Sense, by that Sense. What these me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
are may easily be collected from what has
been said before. As little occasion have we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
to add any thing of the Internal, Common
Sense, which by <hi>Aristotle</hi> and others is call'd
so, because conversant about sensible Objects,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,

follows, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
(see beside the Comment of the <hi>Coim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra</hi>
Doctors) by whom it is defin'd, that Sense,
by which we distinguish the several properties,
which we acquire a Perception of by the five
Externals, and can be no other than that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive
or apprehensive Faculty which is to be
prov'd immaterial, for there is no distinguishing
one thing from another, but by a clear and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
apprehension of each.</p>
            <p>What we are next to prove, is the reality
of extended Beings, and the Immateriality of
that Being which perceives or apprehends and
judges of them. Whenever we conceive an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Being as able to affect us in the manner
lately mention'd, we must conceive something
more than length and breadth alone, because
they cannot alone affect us with those general
properties which we perceive in Objects long
and broad, for if they affect, they must really
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:94057:51"/>
be, and yet they cannot really exist, unless they
have also Depth as well as Length and Breadth,
a proposition of it self so evident, that it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
of no further Illustration. And indeed it
is high time to desist from this Demonstration
of the Truth of the Senses, which I have not
drawn out to such a length, as believing any just
Scruples are to be raised about them, but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
those unjust ones, which other have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
in the minds of many. In order to prove
the latter, <hi>viz.</hi> the Immateriality of the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive
and Judicious Part, I will not pretend
to define all the properties that may accrue to a
Being extended, and boldly to exclude Cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from among them, but shall make it my bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
to evince from what we certainly know of
an extended Being, that Cogitation cannot apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to it. Now thus much we plainly know of
an extended Being, that it cannot be such, unless
it have three Dimensions, Length, Breadth,
and Depth; and nothing Long, Broad, and
Deep can move it self, unless by virtue of some
other power lodg'd in it; which power, as it is
to be the Inciter of its extended Subject, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but be so far independant of it, as to be able
to move without it, because the motion of that
is antecedent to the motion of its Subject, and
if it be so far independant, it must necessarily sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
in a state distinct from its extended Subject,
since it is a most gross absurdity to suppose, that
Faculty whereby the Being in which it rests
is incited to move, should be incapacitated to
move, unless with that Being wherein it rests;
and yet if it is not, it is plain it must subsist di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly
from it, because all properties, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:94057:52"/>
of whose Existence is their Subject, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but move along with their Subject; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
to suppose such to move without their
Subject, is to set them free either more or less
from their Subject, and to allow them to move
only in proportion to the degree of such their
Liberty and Alienation. Now every act of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
if it proceed from any thing extended,
must be wrought by motion, for all alteration
must be the effect of motion, and whether that
which properly perceives, be extended or not,
the condition of it is in some degree alter'd, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
conscious to it self of a different state from
what it had before: as when it has perceiv'd a
Triangular Body, or (suppose) none before,
and afterwards perceives a round one. If that
from whence therefore this alteration arises is
lodg'd in a Being extended, Motion is lodg'd
in it, and if Motion, it must be either that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependant
Power discours'd of before, or an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
only concomitant with Extension: grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the first, by what has been so lately offer'd,
we prove it to be distinct from the Being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
and so immaterial, but if you will have
it to be an accident only Concomitant with Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension;
upon this Supposition again, it cannot
move or be mov'd, but along with its extended
Subject, and in the same Species of Motion, that
is, it can only change Site and Place, since an
extended Substance in motion differs from one at
rest no more than <hi>relatively,</hi> or with respect to
something without it self. For we will suppose a
Cube divided into ten thousand Cubes, and every
one of these subdivided into twice as many more,
till of one solid Cube it becomes at last a heap
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:94057:52"/>
of Atoms; and next let us suppose these Atoms
so dispos'd to play amongst one another, that
each of them shall (if you please) have a quite
different motion from all the rest. What
changes would ensue in this Cube of matter?
None certainly intrinsecal. But that Portion
of the Cube, which before its division lay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuous
to one certain Angle of it, upon the
Intersection would relinquish the Superficies
whereto it was continuous before, and apply
its own naked Superficies to another; suppose
that of the Instrument, or in what part it might
not be contiguous to the Instrument, to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies
of any intermediate matter whatever.
The Division and Subdivision thus atchiev'd,
and all the Particles thrown into Motion, what
other alterations are like to arise? Still none,
for every of the mov'd Particles continues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecally
the same; and the relative difference
too is the same as it was in the Division, this
single circumstance excepted, that in the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
the changes of each Particle's Site might
be fewer and slower, which in the commotion
they shift oftner and quicker; so that a Body
mov'd, and a body at rest, are materially and
intrinsecally the same; but by reason of Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
one Body looses that relation of Vicinity
which it had to another Body, and renews it
with a third. But beside, the power of Perce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
must be essentially united to that of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
for as it is evident, that those Ideas of
things, which the judgment compares, are the
very same with those which we receive by sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
apprehension, only more in number, and
Parts so mainly constituent of every Operation
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:94057:53"/>
of Judgment, that there can be no such Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
effected without them, so cannot that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
whereby single Ideas are barely contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
be indeed distinct from that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templates
them in the same manner, only in
greater numbers, and under their mutual Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
seeing where the Operation is essentially
one, the Operant cannot be more; for altho'
two distinct Efficients may concur to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
one Effect, yet that Effect must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
be compound, so as that the portion
of the Effect wrought by one Efficient, may be
distinct from the portion of the other Efficient,
but every act of Judgment is simple, and one
portion of it, <hi>viz.</hi> that of comparison, cannot
be separated from the other of Ideas without
being lost. The Unity of the Efficient there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
being thus prov'd from the Unity of the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
all that we have to prove is, that every act
of Judgment must be truly and properly Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and every act that has in it succession must
be Motion, not that of Bodies out of one place
or position into another, which yet is analogous
to it so far as it is successive, but the continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a complex act through all its parts, or
that Transition which in every judgment we
make from one simple Idea to another: and this
power of Motion, if seated in matter, must be
independent of it, as acting without it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
before it, for the other brute properties
of matter are of necessity perfectly unactive and
montionless, till agitated by this power indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of them. But there might yet another ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
as well as a further confirmation of
this be fetch'd <hi>à Posteriori,</hi> from the Wisdom of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:94057:53"/>
God, when that and his other Perfections have
been first prov'd from the Existence of even the
smallest Particle of matter, which according to
the method we shall now pursue, may be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and directly prov'd.</p>
            <p>Having therefore thus demonstrated the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence
and general Properties of all Beings im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
affecting either our sensitive or think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Faculties, as also the certainty of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence
of those Faculties, and difference of their
Nature, we come next to enquire how they
obtain'd this Existence and these Properties;
whether they gave them to themselves, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
them from some other Cause. Most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
it is, that they exist according to a certain
Line, Succession, or Course of Moments, and
that as to order of Time as they <hi>now are,</hi> so a
little before they <hi>were;</hi> which Line or Course
being trac'd by the moments whereof it consists
to the utmost Length that our or any Multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of such Moments can reach, will at last
terminate in some certain Point, beyond which
Moment the Existence of such Beings is not to
be referr'd, and in which they first began to be.
And this Beginning it is impossible they should
have had from themselves, because they could
not affect till they were; and if not affect, not
effect; whence it follows, that they had some
primary distinct Cause subsisting from Eternity,
not extended, because a successive Existence is
inseparable from Extension, for we can no soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
perceive an extended Being, but we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it as existing in time, because every ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Being is apt for, or capable of being
mov'd along the parts of a Line, the measure
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:94057:54"/>
of Motion, by which we thus demonstrate the
Succession of its Existence.</p>
            <figure/>
            <p>Let <hi>(a)</hi> be the Being extended; <hi>(f) (l)</hi> a
a Line along which <hi>(a)</hi> may be mov'd, while
<hi>(a)</hi> exists upon the space of the Line <hi>(f) (l)</hi>
between <hi>(f) (h),</hi> it cannot exist also upon the
space between <hi>(i) (b).</hi> And yet seeing it is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of being mov'd along the Line <hi>(f) (l),</hi>
till arriv'd to the space between <hi>(i) (b),</hi> it is
no less capable of existing upon the space between
<hi>(i) (b),</hi> but not till it has left off to exist upon
the space between <hi>(f) (h):</hi> and yet it
could not be capable of existing upon the space
between <hi>(i) (b),</hi> after it had existed upon the
space between <hi>(f) (h),</hi> unless it had existed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
between <hi>(f) (h),</hi> and so many moments
of Existence after its Existence between <hi>(f) (h),</hi>
as its Motion should last through the several spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
till it might arrive at that between <hi>(i) (b),</hi>
which Succession of Existence being trac'd back
to the utmost extent that any Multiplication
can attain, will at last terminate in some certain
point, and therefore beyond that require a Cause
which might subsist from Eternity. Beside,
without Motion, this extended Being could ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
or affect nothing; and yet this first Mover,
if an extended Substance, could not have self-motion
by the Demonstrations already offer'd
upon that Argument.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:94057:54"/>
And this prime unextended Cause must be
also Infinite, not only possessing Perfections e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
to those of its own Effect; but all others
whatsoever, or all Perfection <hi>possible,</hi> and that
because its Existence is necessary and eternal, for
to all manner of Perfection there accrues, at least,
a Possibility of Existence. So that whatsoever
Perfection is missing in the Effects of this prime
Cause, cannot but exist in the Cause it self; see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as we observ'd before, all Perfection
carries in it at least a Possibility of Existing,
which yet it could not, unless it may exist in the
Prime Cause, in case it cannot in its Effects.
There is no absurdity at all in affirming, that
whatsoever is a Perfection may exist; so far from
that, that it is impossible to feign any Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
wanting such a Possibility: but if it may
neither exist in the Effects nor prime Cause, (sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
that to be single) it is an absurdity to say
that such a Possibility is essential to all Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
And although in the Effects of the prime
Cause, whatsoever is possible may not be found,
and indeed cannot, for they are all notoriously
limited, the Extended by their Superficies, and
the Unextended by the defect of their powers;
and whatsoever is limited either way, must be
capable of Univocal Additions; and when those
are obtain'd, still of greater; so that something
of Perfection will ever be wanting to them: yet
in the prime Cause it self, whose Existence is
necessary, all manner of Perfection must, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of its Possibility of Existence, truly and
really exist; for it could not be in its own nature
apt to exist, unless it had been so either from
Eternity or from a certain Period of Time: now
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:94057:55"/>
although the Perfections of the Effects of the
prime Cause are in their own Nature capable
of existing only within a certain Period of time;
yet whatsoever Perfection may possibly exist in
the prime Cause, whose Existence is necessary,
cannot but truly and really exist in it: Now all
Perfection whatsoever carries with it such a
Possibility; as for instance, the power of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
a new World out of nothing, or a new or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Effects answerable to that already created
is such a Perfection, as may possibly be in the
prime Cause of those Effects already extant. But
yet it could not possibly be in this prime Cause,
unless co-eternal with it; seeing if it were tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary,
it must be only the Effect of this prime
Cause, and not of the Essence of it, nor co-e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
with it, unless it necessarily existed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
all Eternals exist by necessity. Neither is
this to say, that what is most perfect, must
therefore exist, because Existence is one of the
Perfections of that most Perfect, whereas indeed
it is inseparable from even the least Perfection.
No, all that I contend for amounts to no more
than, That in a Being of necessary Existence, and
in such an one only, all Perfection possible must
as necessarily exist. Not but from the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the nature of the Effects already in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Infinity of the prime Cause, is no less
conspicuous, supposing it no derogation, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it is not, from the Majesty of the prime
Cause, to say, that it cannot create more kinds
of Beings than what are already created. <hi>Kinds,</hi>
I say, which are these, a Spirit and a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
and in truth it implies a mere Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction,
to say there can be more Kinds of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:94057:55"/>
Beings than these; for whatsoever is, must ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be extended or not extended; if the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
'tis a Body; if the latter, 'tis either an
Intelligent Spirit, or a blind, unintelligent E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nergy.
And by these, I mean a Spirit in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.
Now more sorts of Beings than these
there cannot be; and a contradiction, I say, is
the Effect of supposing there can; because ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
a third Kind, it must be of such Beings
as are neither extended nor unextended, which
'tis evident cannot be any Beings at all. But
of these Kinds the Cause that first produc'd 'em,
can, at pleasure, produce new Qualities and
Numbers, since it is perfectly, and in all respects
the same that it was from Eternity; it being
impossible, but that whatsoever exists from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity
must be immutable, because its Existence
is necessary. Nay further, all Quantities or
Numbers of Substances anew created, be they
never so great, a Cause of Eternal Subsistence
can produce in one act, because it does not ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
according to the Succession of the parts
of time, although to us it may seem so to do,
whose comprehension is so narrow, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of it, as not to collect any manner of Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence
or Operation, but what is successive, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from the notice of our own Existence or,
Operation, or those of other Beings falling un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
our observation. So soon as such Substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are created, they cannot, 'tis true, exist, but
according to such a Succession; but the act of
Creation, as it is the act of the Creator, is no
more concern'd with any order of time than the
Agent: So that if a thousand Worlds not yet
created were to be created with respect to the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:94057:56"/>
Creator, they must be created together with that
World already created. All which is no other
than consonant to the Principles of those many
Philosophers who define Eternity a Possession at
once of all Past, Present, and to Come. To be
sufficient therefore to create all Substances that
can be created without a Contradiction, and
this at once, certainly appertains to no less than
a power Infinite; for although the Quantities
and Numbers of the Substances created, let
them be never so great, must be Finite, yet the
power of creating as many more remains in the
Creator. Nor seems it any diminution of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator's
Perfection, that the Quantities and Numbers
of the Substances created must be Finite; since
if they might be Infinite, they might not only
rival their Cause, but oblige him to confer that
upon Beings not existing from Eternity, which
only accrues to Beings existing from Eternity;
for nothing can be Infinite as to continuance,
unless a necessary Existent; and nothing Infinite
on other accounts unless Infinite as to continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
because every thing else must be the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of a Being of Infinite continuance, and
that Effect must be less perfect than its Cause,
as partaking, even of substantially and essential<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the same as the Cause, of but a portion of
its Cause, which yet a Temporary Being cannot
of an Eternal, because whatever is Eternal in
such a Being, is in its own nature incommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
to a Temporary Being: and yet no Effect
of an Infinite Cause can be less perfect than its
Cause without being Finite, by which it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
that to suppose the Quantities and Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Substances created may be Infinite,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:94057:56"/>
is to suppose the Cause of them may be guilty
of a most gross Absurdity and Contradiction;
and not only so, but that it may likewise be mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
though of necessary Existence. What I
have said of Substances, holds equally of their
Properties. And this argument it self might
suffice to demonstrate the Infinity of each Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
in the Creator, which may be found in
a more imperfect degree in the things crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>The Eternity of the All perfection, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly

Cause being thus evinc'd, we are yet to reflect a
little upon the necessity of all those Possible and
Eternal Perfections being united in that one
prime Cause; and here it must be remember'd,
that if they are not united in the same Infinite,
they must either as to one part or kind of them
be Finite or Infinite: not Infinite, for what
can be a bolder contradiction, than that one
share of such Perfections should be Infinite, when
there remains a great deal of Perfection not u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
to it. Finite therefore. If Finite, in
some measure defective; if defective, wanting
that principle, which, where ever it is found,
constitutes that Being altogether perfect, <hi>viz.</hi>
a necessity of existing, the want whereof must be
therefore the foundation of Imperfection, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Perfection is constituted of Reality, being
only a <hi>Plenitude of Existence,</hi> so as that, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
the Perfection of a Body is no more than
the real Existence of its Extension, and of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
else goes to the constituting of a Body; and
the Perfection of its Extension, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> consists in
its being real or <hi>positive,</hi> for nothing is further
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:94057:57"/>
perfect than it is <hi>positive;</hi> nor whatever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
the Essences of things any otherwise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summate,
than as those Constituents are true
and genuine Existents. It cannot therefore
exist necessarily, and if not necessarily, not from
Eternity; whence it is clear it must be essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
united to all other possible Perfection, that
is of Eternal Existence (<hi>Essentially,</hi> I say, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there can be no Union of Composition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
two Beings, unless each is in its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
able to subsist by it self.) So that all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
whose Existence is from Eternity, must
be collected and essentially united in one Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
most Perfect Cause of all other Beings
whatsoever.</p>
            <p>I know not whether I need particularly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
upon any further Eviction of the Omnisci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of this prime Cause, that being inclusively
prov'd by the general Argument so lately hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in proof of his All-perfection: but yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
this Attribute is a proper foundation for
the Demonstration of his Providence, it may
not be amiss to consider it in it self. So slight
is the acquaintance we have with Spiritual Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of a limited nature, and much more with
that of an unlimited one, that what we learn
concerning them, we acquire partly by general
Rules of Entities, partly from certain general
Properties of the Spiritual Beings themselves.
That the prime Cause must in it self have In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent
Faculties, there needs no other Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
than that certain Effects of it have. That
part of its Productions which is call'd and
known to be the Rational and Thinking, have
receiv'd of it considerable Abilities in that kind.
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:94057:57"/>
We apprehend, we know, we think, and are
admitted not only to the Contemplation of our
selves and Fellow-Creatures, but even into the
<hi>Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi> to the Contemplation of
the prime Cause it self: yet not without great
restrictions; it being the Prudence of the prime
Cause to bestow but a scanty Portion of that
upon its Creatures, which as it would be in
them the similitude of it self, so it would tempt
them to presume upon their own dignity, and
consequently to be forgetfull of his. (Not to
mention here the event of our first Parents
Lapse.) However such a portion of Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
we can boast of as serves to signifie the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
an Intelligent Being also: and as the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent
part of his Creation bespeaks him In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent,
so that with all the other parts of it
bespeak him infinitely so, because indeed they
could not have been at all, unless that which
gave them their Being had thoroughly and most
intimately known the Ends and Essences of them,
because a Being independent, existing from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity,
and therefore necessary and immutable,
could not be mov'd to exert the act of Creation,
unless by more than a brute Principle of Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which Motion must either have continu'd
from Eternity, and so the Effects of it have been
Eternal, the Absurdity of which we have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
refuted, or have been an arbitrary or volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Motion arising from a Principle of Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.
Nor can it be, but that these two Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
should operate for ends; seeing this vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
Motion could not have proceeded from
the Intelligent Principle, unless the Intelligent
Principle upon notice or conception (if I may
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:94057:58"/>
so speak) of things, found, at least, some end
to urge that voluntary Motion; so that as every
the least Effect of that Motion must have been
for an end; so must it also have issued from an
Intelligent Principle in the arbitrary Mover:
whence it is evident this arbitrary Mover or
Cause must have a perfect and absolute know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of all its own Effects. But here I would
not be understood either to define the Intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
Powers of the first Cause, or the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of their Operations; when all I attempt, is
to shew, that the least Effect of the prime Cause
must flow from a voluntary Motion (to which
although infinitely more perfect, that imperfect
one of our Wills is somewhat analogous) arising
from an Idea of that which is to be the Effect
of that voluntary Motion, and that Idea also
infinitely more perfect than any of ours. And
as this arbitrary Cause cannot but have the
most entire and absolute knowledge of all its own
Effects, so must it be no less acquainted with
whatever is possible besides, because it compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends
in it all such Possibilities; and whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it so comprehends it must it self be consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
of, seeing those Principles of Intelligence
and voluntary Motion already mention'd, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be, as perhaps in Inferiour and Finite Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionals,
distinct from the other Faculties and
Attributes, but on the same account that such
Principle are asserted at large to be in the
prime Cause, they must also be annex'd to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
of it is found to be of eternal Existence;
seeing whatsoever is found to be so, is alike in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent
of any foreign Impulsor as the prime
Cause understood at large, alike necessary and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:94057:58"/>
immutable, and accordingly a Being alike Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
and Arbitrary.</p>
            <p>Again, as this prime Cause is infinitely pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull
and Wise, so it must be infinitely Just and
Mercifull too, and that because its Effects are
the Objects of its Love, as well as the Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring
of its power, for so long as they exist,
they are certainly precious in its esteem, and not
only when they were first created, but even as
long as they continue in being, it cannot but
repute them <hi>good.</hi> In truth, unless they were
so, their All-wise Cause would fall under the
imputation of acting in vain, and be oblig'd in
its own Justification to annihilate the universal
System, or at least such portions of it as were of
no value in its sight; by which Rule, as we
may be assur'd of its general Concern for all, so
of that Concern's being proportionable to the
particular value of each Member: so that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
such Member in its particular Station is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted,
and provided for according to its Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
the measure whereof is best to be learn'd
by examining how large its capacity is of being
benefited by the first Cause, for there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more certain, than that the first All-wise
Cause rather than act in vain and to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
will benefit it and bless it to the full mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of that Capacity: Yet not without condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
too, where and so far as the Effect is qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify'd
for entring, or has actually enter'd into
them. Wherefore in cases even of Degeneracy
in such an Effect, the small remains of that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
which it receiv'd at first from its Cause,
are still valu'd by its Cause, nay even when it
seems good to the Cause, that its Effects should
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:94057:59"/>
undergo any Severities, it cannot but either com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensate
for them afterwards, which for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
already given, it is oblig'd to do, when
conditions are observ'd; or if it consigns over
the violators to a perpetual punishment (not
to insist upon any other defence of its Justice
therein) I know not why we may not believe
that the Effects even by the Laws of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
decline through degeneracy into such a
state of Misery, and acquire such a Disposition,
that upon being translated according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
course of things into a new Station and
condition, they necessarily become miserable, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thro' those Defects which they owe to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and partly from impressions from without,
which could not affect them, if the nature of the
Effect had undergone no change by its Degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy.
Lastly, Nothing is a more easie Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
than of the Providence of the first Cause
from the certainty of its Justice and Mercy. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it is most conspicuous in every part of its
great Work, wherein the whole contrivance ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
so admirable, the subserviency of this to
that so regular, and the distribution of proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
so just, that of all Miracles, the order of
Nature, which we daily behold, is certainly
the greatest. Nor does there seem to be any
necessity of betaking our selves to the more sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
methods of Demonstration, when if we
would never so fain, we cannot extricate our
selves from evidences of such a Providence. And
when <hi>Democritus</hi> had modell'd his Atoms, and
<hi>Epicurus</hi> had, as he fansied, put them in a right
way to gather into a Body, what did it avail
them? They neither could be Atoms till they
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:94057:59"/>
were made so, nor move a point on, till the first
Mover set them forward. But then what if
the Beauty, Structure, and Order which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su'd,
could not arise from any such Principles,
as it is plain they could not? For supposing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so great variety in the figures of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms,
that one Species of Motion, <hi>viz. Casus
declivis,</hi> could not by any means beget such a
multiplicity of Forms, but only generate a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid,
flinty Mass; <hi>solid</hi> and <hi>flinty,</hi> I say, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
no manner of concourse could so strongly
compact the Atoms as that. Indeed it must
have fasten'd all of them so close together that
nothing could have broken so many free distinct
Bodies off the Rock, but the Supervention of
an Almighty Arm: nor yet could each such
Frustulum have been so modify'd and temper'd
as we find, unless by the same: So that the
Founders and Maintainers of these Principles,
instead of mending the matter, only made more
work for themselves, and brought their Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
so fairly together at last, that when they
should have been got asunder again, nothing
but a superiour Agent, being that which they
made sure of escaping, could separate them. For
alas! Chance has not strength enough. If she
might bring them together, she could do no
more afterwards, but leave them together. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
what is this Chance at last? So far from
being a Cause, that it never can be any thing
but a Coincident. For granting these Atoms
fell thus together; did they chance, I beseech
you, to fall together before they did fall
together? And still it's all the same thing, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
these Atoms encounter in one kind of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:94057:60"/>
or in many; for if in many, so as that they
gather into many distinct Bodies, each of those
Bodies must be superlatively compact, seeing
that motion, which is to bring them together,
will bring them as close together, as they can
be brought, when there is nothing to interpose.
But what shall at last animate some of these
lumps, and temper all of them? Let the Ato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist
therefore take his choice, whether he will
have one great Mass, or many little ones. But
I digress too far, it being my present design
not so much to confute Error as demonstrate
Truth; although indeed the latter is much at
one with the former, especially in the dispute
before us. Yet the reigning sottishness of that
opinion so star'd me in the face, while I would
discourse upon the Providence of the prime
Cause, that I could not handsomely forbear a
rebuke, the continuation of the Effects of the
prime Cause being no better accounted for by
this barren, childish Hypothesis than their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal;
for as they could not give themselves a
Being, but must necessarily have receiv'd it from
an All-perfect Cause; so (not to mention the
necessity of perpetual Creation, in order to the
Subsistence of such Effects, sufficiently evinc'd
by others) from the nature and Attributes of
this prime Cause, I think I have clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated,
that it certainly governs and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
for all, even the smallest of its Effects,
and this All-perfect first Cause is GOD.</p>
            <p>But now where appears that little half Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
the Atheist? No longer, I hope, setting
up for a Philosopher, when for ought I know,
the Brutes even of the slowest apprehension may
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:94057:60"/>
claim Pre-eminence in the Schools before him:
The Brutes, whose every motion betrays a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciousness
of a Truth, which nothing but the
darkest blindness of Soul can escape. The
Brain must be clouded thick on all sides, or so
dazling a Lustre could not but strike it. Is
this then the penetrating Man? the subtile in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventive,
<hi>Verè adeptus?</hi> a Prodigy in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest!
if he could raise Effects without Causes,
and begin to build his Houses from the Tiles.
But alas! there is not one Phaenomenon in all
nature to be so much as plausibly interpreted,
but upon the confidence of a first Cause. Those
Accounts of Meteors which we have receiv'd,
are perhaps the fairest and easiest on all hands of
any other Physical Notices, whether we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
<hi>Cartes, Gassendus, Aristotle,</hi> or the Stoicks,
(Comets only excepted) and yet no Vapours
could be so much as exhal'd, or any condens'd
or rarefy'd, but by the interposition of the first
Cause; for if transmutations analogous to those
in the Alembicks of our <hi>Vertuosi</hi> require such
peculiar and most exquisite Instruments; how
much rather do they require an Omnipotent
Author and Cause to give an Efficacy to these
Instruments? And indeed the first blunder of
the Atheistical Philosopher has ever been his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staking
Instruments for Efficient Causes; for
not discerning the difference between that which
acts only necessarily, and that which acts arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily,
the poor Beetles have all along excluded
a Deity by confounding the first with the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Yet there's the mischief of it, these Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
cannot but be lost to all sound Reason and
Sense, before they straggle into such unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:94057:61"/>
delirious Notions; and how is it possible
to correct Error, when instead of any Candour
and Judgment, you have nothing to treat with
but obstinate Conceitedness, profound Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and desperate Indocility.</p>

Cum jam compendiariam hancce Idearum Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storiam
conscripsimus, deinde considerandum
subit quid suas esse Ideas designavit Cartesius;
quem etiamsi utpote virum definiendi peritissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum,
claram &amp; dilucidam significationem tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere
expectandum esset, nihil tamen aliud ex
illo quàm Platonicas allusiones ac descriptiones
percipimus, eo scilicet viri acutissimi consilio,
ut cum suum super iis Judicium obscurum &amp;
ambiguum reliquisset, exortis subinde Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onibus,
ad sensum sibi commodissimum inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretari
liceret. Quam conjecturam ne injuriâ
ac invidiosè proferri existimares, non abs re fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
videtur, si nonnullas ex illius Idearum defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionibus
colligemus, collectas inter se compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bimus.
Tertia Meditatio haec habet, <hi>Nunc

imagines sunt, quibus solis propriè convenit Ideae

Theologo igitur juxta genuinum vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabuli

Atqui nihilominus Apologistam malè habent

quòd ita repraesentari non possit, mihi omninò
arridet: quodsi Magister non minùs apertè sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiam
suam exposuerat, Theologo in istam
ulteriùs inquirere nihil opus esset. Cum verò
Ideas suas tanquam imagines rerum descripserit,
cum inter has tanquam imagines rerum, Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
Chimaerae, Coeli, Angeli, etiam Numinis
imaginem reposuerit, nos quaeso quâ praerogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va

Ergò quanta &amp; cujusmodi sit ista-notitia,

id in Cartesio castigantem, quod tu in

omnium Idearum dignitatem exaequare,
sic tibi Theologum puram intellectionem ab i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginatione
non distinxisse minimè complacuit.
Si verò in eundem, in quem tuus Cartesius, er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rorem
devenerit Theologus, vel te neutrum ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,
vel non hunc magìs quàm illum corripere
omninò decebat. En verò cujusmodi specimen
quo differentiam Idearum Intellectùs &amp; imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nationis

Si verò de Chiliogono cogitare velim,
equidem bene intelligo illud figuram esse mille late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus

quasi aliquis, quin Intellectûs &amp; Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginationis
Ideae longè inter se discrepent, quin
illae quàm hae multò magis sint perspicuae, dubita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret:
quid autem est, quòd Imaginationem tam

quàm in alio quocunque mens versaretur? quip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe

lineas tanquàm praesentes intueor. Quòd si rem
sic habere tueberis, vel actus intellectionis &amp;
intuitionis in unum confundes, cum tamen idem
distinctos esse subinnuas, vel si sunt plures, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse

eloco: cum infinitam, independentem esse defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio,

<hi>Quandam</hi> summo jure reprehendit? Quid enim
hoc est, quàm quae fuerit (ista substantia) te

Atqui istud tantam quidem viri imprudentiam
