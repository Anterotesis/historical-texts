         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Vindication of Mr. Chriſtopher Love
from divers reproaches caſt upon him by
the Malignant party.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F a mans good name be as precious
Oyntment, there will not be wanting
many Flyes (to carry about flying
Reports) to corrupt it: Although I
deſerve not a name among the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of the moſt high God, yet would
I not loſe that room which any hath vouchſafed me
in their hearts, not be made an abhorring to them.
'Tis true, this Sermon which I preacht at <hi>Vxbridge</hi>
expoſeth me to the envy of the bad, the jealouſie of
the good, yea the ſcandalous Reports of all; ſhould
I now be ſilent, I ſhould ſtrengthen thoſe reports,
and ratifie the rumours unjuſtly raiſed againſt me.
I confeſſe the meanneſſe of my gifts, and fewneſſe of
my years, (being no more then 28.) doth lay a great
diſcouragement upon my ſpirit to come into pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
view, to hold forth the dim light of a candle
now the Sun ſhineth; to bring in my poor mite,
when men now adayes caſt in of their abundance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Gods Treaſury; had I not been preſt under the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:34660:3"/>
preſſure of reproaches, I ſhould never have brought
my <hi>Sermon</hi> (which I preacht at <hi>Vxbridge</hi>) to the
Preſſe; when I Preacht it, I accounted it no other
then as an untimely birth, that ſhould never ſee the
Sun; the reaſon why I now bring it to light, is not
any high conceit that I have of it, but a falſe conceit
that many have both of the <hi>Sermon,</hi> and my ſelf that
preacht it. I am preſented to the world as an enemy
to Treaties, or a peace by that way; I can make my
Appeal to Heaven, where my witneſſe is, that in the
travel of my Soul I have unceſſantly cryed unto
God for a good ſucceſſe to that Treaty, that by it
<hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> might flouriſh in our dayes, onely an
unſound and an unſafe <hi>peace</hi> have I preached and
prayed againſt.</p>
            <p>I have onely two things faithfully and humbly to
preſent to your conſideration. Firſt, the <hi>Call</hi> that I
had to preach at <hi>Vxbridg</hi> at that day. Secondly, the
<hi>Matter</hi> which I preacht. For the firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Call</hi>
that I had to preach, I ſhall briefly relate: On Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſday
night the 29 of <hi>January,</hi> (being the monethly
Faſt) I had notice that the Commiſſioners were come
to <hi>Vxbridg,</hi> and that Mr. <hi>Martial</hi> or ſome other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
that attended upon the Honourable Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners,
was to preach the Thurſday following;
(which was the firſt day of the <hi>Treaty</hi>) hearing of
this, I rode from <hi>Windſor</hi> Caſtle to <hi>Vxbridg</hi> on <hi>Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi>
morning; went forth with to Mr. <hi>Martial,</hi> to
know whether he Preacht, who told me he did not,
yet ſaid that there was a Sermon: ſoon after I went
towards the Church to be an Hearer. As I was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
I met the Governour of the Town, who told me
that he with others had been waiting in the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:34660:3"/>
for a Sermon, but the Miniſter expected to
preach was not come; whereupon he deſired me
that I would preach, elſe the Congregation would
be diſappointed. To whom I anſwered, that I had
no thoughts of preaching, but to be an hearer, yet
rather then the Congregation ſhould be diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
I would ſpend ſome half an hour to give them a
word of <hi>Exhortation,</hi> which accordingly I did. Now
whether this was not a hand of Heaven to caſt me
upon the work, let my accuſers themſelves be Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
I am conſtrained to write the manner how I
came to preach, to wipe off thoſe ſcandals that are
caſt upon me. Some ſay that I intruded my ſelf on
the work, when divers can tell how earneſtly Capt.
<hi>Hampton,</hi> the Governour of the Town, did ſollicite
me, telling me elſe the Congregation would be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed.
Some were ſo ſhameleſſe as to ſay, that
I thruſt M. <hi>Martial</hi> down the Pulpit ſtaires, when
'tis well known M. <hi>Martial</hi> was not there all that
day; beſides, had he been there to preach, I am ſo far
from doing any ſuch unchriſtian action, as to rob the
<hi>Congregation</hi> of the Labours of him whoſe Books I
am no<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> worthy to carry after him, yea (if it were an
expreſſion meet for a meer man, I could ſay, whoſe
<hi>ſhooe-latchet</hi> I am not worthy to untye. Others ſay,
that one Mr. <hi>Kem</hi> was to preach; others ſay, ſome
adjacent Miniſter, (whoſe turn it was to ſupply the
lecture that day) whether the one or the other, I
knew not then; onely this I know, it was almoſt a
11 of the clock when I was entreated to preach: the
Governour and ſome of the people came out of the
<hi>Congregation,</hi> thinking they had been diſappointed of
a Sermon; yea, I did my ſelf alſo bid the Clark call a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:34660:4"/>
long Pſalm, that ſo if the Miniſter who was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to preach had come in the mean time, he might
have ſupplyed the place.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>What ever your Call was to preach that day, yet
the matter which you preacht was unſeaſonable in that
place, before that Auditory, and at that time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, Firſt, it was their uſual Lecture-day;
but a Country Auditory, none of the Commiſſioners of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
fide were there. Secondly, Had they been there, I ſpake
not a word touching the Commiſſioners of either ſide, only
prayed for our own. Thirdly if any thing were unſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
it muſt be this; I adviſed the Auditors not to dote too
much on Treaties of Peace: What unſeaſonableneſſe was
in this? I hope a Miniſter may adviſe a people not to dote
too much upon ordinances, or upon duties, yet this no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſparagement
to either, or to the authority of God that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns
both; one may adviſe another not to dote too much
upon Wife and children, yet this advice doth not reflect to
the diſgrace of either: in the like manner, might not a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
adviſe a Congregation not to dote too much upon that
Treaty, yet this advice no wayes reflects on the Treaters, or
Treaty it ſelf. I ſaid further, that whiles our enemies go
on in their wicked practices, and whiles we keep to our
principles, we may as ſoon make fire and water to agree, and
(I had almoſt ſaid) reconcile Heaven and Hell, as their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
and ours; either they muſt grow better, or we muſt grow
worſe, before it is poſſible for us to agree; wherein is this
unſeaſonable? ſh<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>w me, and I will fall down with an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment
at your feet.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>Why did you not write this Vindication ſooner; had
there not been a fault you would not have been ſo long ſilent, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
many aſperſion thus to ſpread.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I briefly anſwer, Firſt, I acknowledge ſuch a
ſenſe and apprehenſion I have of theſe poor fruits o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> my ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
that I had no thoughts at all to print my Sermon, had
not the importunity of divers friends, who are both godly
and wiſe, prevailed with me, as alſo the conſideration that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:34660:4"/>
theſe ſcandals would not onely reflect upon my ſelf,
but on other Miniſters alſo who cleave to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
proceedings, as if they were of the ſame ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
that I am unjuſtly preſented to the World to be
of, had not there conſiderations ſwayed with me, I
ſhould not have brought my Sermon to publick
view, but have waited in ſilence, ſubmiſſion, and
patience on my God for a Vindication, knowing aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly
the innocency and integrity of my heart and
carriage to be clear in this matter; I bleſſe God, the
integrity of my ſpirit (being in nothing about this
matter conſcious to my ſelf) hath been as a brazen
wall againſt all the ſcandals which have hence been
darted againſt me, that none of them have entred to
to pierce the quietneſſe and content of my ſpirit; I
remember what the Poet ſaid,</p>
            <q>
               <l>—Hic muru<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               <l>Nil conſcire ſibi, nulla palleſcere culpa.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Secondly, it was meet I ſhould be thus long ſilent,
leſt I ſhould have anticipated the Parliament (before
whom ſome accuſations againſt me were preſented)
I ſhould have been pragmatical, unwiſe, yea alſo
have blemiſht my own vindication, ſhould not I
have waited for their determinations; who have
(by an Order of the Houſe of Commons) cleared and
acquitted me touching this matter.</p>
            <p>It was requiſite I ſhould ſtay untill the Treaty
was over, leſt it might exaſperate the ſpirits of our
enemies, and ſo father that on me as if I had not
a peaceable diſpoſition, which indeed is the baſtard
that ought to be layed before their own doores;
though their words be ſmoother then butter, yet
war is in their hearts, but Peace in mine.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:34660:5"/>
Fourthly, I deemed it my beſt way to wait a while
in ſilence that I might the better hear and know the
ſcandalous aſperſions caſt upon me, that I might the
eaſier clear my ſelf. Some report that I ran out of
<hi>Vxbridge</hi> as ſoon as I had preacht the Sermon, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
aſhamed of what I had done, whereas 'tis known
by divers I went publickly up and down the Town,
and ſtaid at leaſt four hours after the ſermon in the
Town; others ſay that I retired my ſelf, and kept
out of the way when I was ſent for by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
when divers can teſtifie I went up and down
the City; yea, was ſo far from hiding my ſelf from
any Court of Judicature, that I uſed meanes that I
might be heard; that I might come to anſwer the
accuſations that were againſt me. Malignants (who
would have it ſo) reported that I was whipt out of
<hi>Vxbridge,</hi> or committed cloſe priſoner in <hi>Vxbridge</hi>
by our Commiſſioners, brought in a Cart to <hi>London,</hi>
committed by the Parliament cloſe Priſoner to <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi>
with many other lying reproaches would they
faſten upon me, whereas 'tis well known I was never
before either Paaliament, or Honourable Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners
imployed by them, or any elſe about this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe,
only I was ſent for by an Order of the Houſe
of Commons, but in regard nothing was brought in
againſt me, I was by them acquitted.</p>
            <p>Thus Courteous Reader, referring my ſelf to thy
favourable cenſure, I humbly take leave for this
time; preſſing my ſelf to be</p>
