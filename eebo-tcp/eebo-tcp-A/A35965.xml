            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>My Lord,</opener>
            <p>IT is not my intention, nor indeed my Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, to Celebrate those Excellent Virtues, which shine so eminently bright in your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship: For they are Themes only fit to be treated on by the strongest Pen, and their Native Worth and Resplendency are their own suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Panegyricks.</p>
            <p>Yet such is the Veneration I have for the Excellent Qualities and Endowments of your Noble Mind, and those Heroick inclinations, that move your Honour to make such exact, diligent, and curious search into all the Secrets and Mysteries of Nature, and encourage all others that Labour therein, that I cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear being so vain as to publish my resentments thereof to the World. These Reasons, My Lord, together with the consideration of your inbred Candour and Generosity, encouraged me to the boldness of committing this small Treatise to your Honours Patronage and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection: To whom I know it will be more
<pb facs="tcp:48889:3"/>
welcome, as containing in it the Choice Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations, both in Physick and Chymistry, of that Famous Man, and great Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor of Nature, Sir <hi>K. D.</hi> A Name, My Lord, that hath peculiar Charms with it, to recommend all that are under its great shadow, to the value and consideration of all the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, the Learned, and the Honourable: So great a Person (may I assume the vanity to say so) I had the Honour and Happiness for several Years to Serve, beyond the Seas, as well as in <hi>England,</hi> and to attend on him more particularly in the Production of many of his incomparable Experiments, and so to continue till his dying day; when he left with me those Choice things contained in this little Treatise.</p>
            <p>And since I fear they suffer diminution of their Worth and Beauty, by passing through my mean Hands, and weak Managery, I thought I could make no better Atonement, than by recommending them to receive Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits and Reinforcements from the Splendour and Eminency of your Illustrious Name. To that end therefore I take the Boldness to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate them at your Honours Feet, where also in all Humility lyes</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Courteous Reader,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS Treatise contains some of the Choicest Collections of the Famous Sir <hi>Kenelm Digby</hi> (some whereof have been wrought by his own hands, some commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to him by Learned Men of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) in praise whereof no more need be said, but, that they are his; either of his production, or of his approbation. I shall therefore, omitting other Artifices and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuations, only satisfie the Reader with all the clearness and ingenuity I can, how I came by them; and thereby I question not, but I shall very successively recommend this Collection of them to all Ingenious Lovers of Art, whose Ears the Fame of the Worthy Author hath reached.</p>
            <p>To this End I must acquaint him, that I had the Honour several years to wait upon Sir <hi>Kenelm,</hi> and to have several of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscripts in my Custody, more particularly this with others was committed to my
<pb facs="tcp:48889:4"/>
Charge, when my Worthy Master intended a Journey to <hi>France</hi> for his Healths sake, and to settle his Affairs there: And he had Progressed in his designed Journey as far as <hi>Cittenburn,</hi> when a violent Distemper forced him back again to his own House in <hi>Covent-Garden</hi>; and in three days after his return, left the Learned World to lament the loss of so great a Man. And here besides his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable self, his Friends and Countrey lost also the benefit of his Famous Library he had in <hi>France</hi> (which for want of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Naturalized) fell into the <hi>French</hi> Kings hands, who bestowed it upon a Gentleman, and it was sold (as I was credibly informed) for ten thousand Crowns. In which no doubt were Manuscripts of his own, of very great worth and rich value, and might have much obliged the World, had they fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of Generous and Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Men.</p>
            <p>But it was my happiness to have, among some other Manuscripts of his, the sole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of this Choice Manual, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains rare and profitable Secrets in Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy and Chymistry, delivered with more perspicuity and plainness than is yet to be found in any Chymical Book: Yea, such, that any understanding Reader may with great facility be conducted as with an <hi>Ariad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48889:4"/>
Line into the most intricate and nither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fatigating <hi>Arcana</hi> of Chymistry. Here are the true <hi>Menstruums</hi> and <hi>Alkahests,</hi> and that hitherto hidden <hi>Secret</hi> of Volatilizing the fixed Salt of Tartar without any <hi>Heterogene</hi> Substance, being the true Vegetable <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struum</hi>; with many other rare and unheard-of Medicines, some whereof I had a mind to reserve for my self, and not to Publish them during my Life, because of the great Experience, and the good Success I have had with them in desperate cases; but <hi>Impium est tacere, quae si promulgata essent, multo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum misere decumbentium, in levamen ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarent.</hi> 'Tis Impious and unchristian to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear the Publication of those things, which being rendred Publick, will effectually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to the Advantage and Comfort of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable Men.</p>
            <p>I have Translated most of these Secrets out of the <hi>Latine, French, German,</hi> and <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Tongues. And if I have committed any indecencies against the Idiom of the <hi>English</hi> Speech, I hope the Candid Reader will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give a Foreigner. As for any Ornaments and Embellishments of Language, as the Work requires no such Painting, so the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishers Foreign Stile and mean Talents are not able to afford it.</p>
            <p>I have no more to acquaint the Reader
<pb facs="tcp:48889:5"/>
with, but that these Secrets had been Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to him long before, but that I have been most part of my time since my Excellent Masters Decease, abroad: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I hope they will be now kindly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained. For it is the height of my Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to make the Memory of my incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Master to Live, who was my pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, and the Worlds publick Benefactor, which can no where do so with such Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage as in his Learned Works, for thereby being dead he yet speaks and instructs.</p>
            <p>And though it be no addition to his Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Name, yet for the Wit and smartness of the thing, and the Readers diversion, I shall conclude here with that Elegant Epitaph made on him by the Ingenious Dr. <hi>Farrar,</hi> which is as followeth.</p>

               <head>How to fix <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> into ☉ by ☿ and ☿ Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate.</head>
               <p>HAving Written so many Proces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and made so many Tryals, and heard so many Discourses of Learned Men upon this Subject, I will give you an Account of an easie Method that I have resolved upon for accomplishing this Work. Namely, That all imperfect Metals and common ☿ may be transmuted into ☉ by one and the same Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod; to wit, by Maturation and Coction, and not by Generation; for that which is generated, is no more that which it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was generated: And that which is
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48889:10"/>
Corrupted, is no more that which it was before it was Corrupted.</p>
               <p>But the baser Metals, after they are trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muted into <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> or ☉ are still Metals never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless as they were before, and the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation of their kind is done by changing their accidental form, not their substantial, the perfection whereof is Maturity; for by Maturation the Metal is brought to a higher degree of perfection.</p>
               <p>Now, imperfect Metals are Maturated by external heat, which digesteth their crude Humidity; yea, ☉ it self may be further perfected, and exalted in colour, as when the Stone is made of it, it will communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate this Maturity to imperfect Metals.</p>
               <p>And Common ☿ is extracted out of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals three several ways; namely, by Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation and Digestion, by Fermentation and by Tincture. As for Cementation that concerneth onely the digestion of <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> into ☉ but not the other too imperfect Metals, nor ☿ either, which is crude, and too much alienated from the Maturity of ☉.</p>
               <p>By Cementation the humidity of <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> brought to maturity. There are seven sorts of Cementations, namely by Salts, A<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>loms, Vitriols, and Metalline-waters: But often-times instead of digesting <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> they bur<gap reason="illegible: in gutter"/>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:48889:10"/>
it; so that this way of making ☉ is with more loss than profit.</p>
               <p>But there is no better way than ☿ and red Precipitate, which I have learned by the afore-mentioned Operations.</p>

               <p>After three days Digestion, take out your Powder, and grind it as before, so that if there be yet any quick ☿ it may be morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. Digest it again as before, and with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ours, to the end, that by the last degree of

heat all the ☿ and ☿ Precipitate may preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate the Powder of <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>, which will begin to grow white.</p>
               <p>Reiterate the addition of ☿ and ☿ Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate in the same quantity as before. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest two days more by four degrees of heat, as before, and the Powder will grow per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly white.</p>
               <p>Then by the same Operation reiterated it will begin to be of a Citrine colour, and fixed.</p>
               <p>And thus by reiterating the Digestions, you may give it what degree of this colour you please; for the oftner you digest it with the said ☿ and ☿ Precipitate, being separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from it again by the last degree of heat, the more the Powder will be of a Citrine Colour.</p>
               <p>Then melt your Powder with Borax, and you shall have ☉ at 24 Carrats, without diminution of the first weight of the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> which will be rather increased. All may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished in the space of One and Twenty days.</p>

               <head>A Work with ☉ and ☿ that Monsieur <hi>Dandre</hi> helped to work in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> in great quantity: Given me by him, <hi>June 1660.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>MOnsieur <hi>Dandre</hi> saith, he wrought thus: Make carefully an <hi>Amalgama</hi> of ℥j. of ☉ in Calx, with 7 or 8 of Purified ☿, then squeeze out so much ☿, that there remain ℥iij. of ☿, and so there be ℥iiij. in the Globe: To this add ℥j. of Sulphur-vive, which is clear and transparent in pieces, (in <hi>Italy,</hi> where he wrought this) and grind all very well toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, (in this consisteth the main part of the Secret, for at every time you are to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy three or four hours in grinding) then put the matter into a Matrass, and give a gentle heat, the Glass unstopped, till the moisture and smoak is exhaled out. Then let the Fire go out, and when the Matrass is cold, seal it Hermetically, and set it to Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime by degrees of Fire, till all that will, be Sublimed, which will be done in 20. or 24. hours. Then the Vessel being cold, break it, and take out the Matter, and grind all together a long time, both that which is Sublimed, and that which is in the bottom, adding ℥j. of new Sulphur-vive, then Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime in the same Method as before; repeat this seven times at the least, adding ℥j.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48889:12"/>
of Sulphur-vive every time, and the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will become a brown yellowish reddish Powder, which will be very fusible, and even in the grinding it will relent, as though it grew moist: You will have ℥iiij. of fixed Matter, which project (in parcels) upon ℥x. of <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> in good Fustion, then put it to the Ooppel, and separating 🜄 and you shall have ℥iiij. of pure ☉.</p>
               <p>You can work but ℥j. of ☉ in one Glass, but you may put 50, or more Glasses in one Sand Furnace with a large Bason of Copper in Sand.</p>

               <head>Some Observations about the said Monsieur <hi>Dandre's</hi> Work.</head>
               <p>THE Operation was made in an <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,</hi> with the Registers at the end, the hole through which the heat was communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, was about the bigness of a brick, the plate which held the Sand was of Iron, and contained 32 Matrasses, sixteen on every side: The Tower was in the middle, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Coals sunk down by degrees. They did not mix the Powder with Wax, nor any thing else in projecting, but only wrapt up in Paper, it did enter, and disappear im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately without smoaking. The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trass ought to have 2 third parts empty.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:48889:12"/>The <hi>Amalgama</hi> was made thus: They took ℥ix. of ☿ and heated it in a Crucible, until it begun to smoak, then they set it upon hot Ashes, and cast therein ℥j. of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats cut in small pieces, and made hot in a Crucible, then stirred it until the ☉ was swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up by the ☿: Then took it off, and let it cool. They did not wash the said <hi>Amalgama:</hi> They used common ☿ only mixed with Quick-lime, and then Distilled in a Retort.</p>
               <p>The Sulphur was transparent and yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low like Amber, in pieces, and to be had at <hi>Carmagnole, Turin, Cony, Mondevic, Saluce, Genes</hi>: It is a Sulphur-vive, cost four, five, or six pence a pound. The Sand they used was round River-sand, and the Matrass was never red in the Sand: They never put above ℥j. of ☉ in one Matrass, nor never above ℥x. of <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> at every Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</p>

And this Butter is the true Magnet which draws it in its purity.) Then put this Spirit into a Glass Cucurbite, of a convenient bigness, fit a Head to it with Limbec and Receiver; lute well all the junctures, and put it thus to putrifie in Ashes for two Months, in which time the Matter will become as red as Blood, and afterwards very black, sticking to the sides of the Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel like glutinous Soot, and the Ethereal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ascendeth and passeth into the Recipient in form of a Spirit, and in Body of fusible Salt, whereof you must also draw the Spirit, and separate them by Distillation with a very gentle fire, until you see a red and sparkling fire upon the Matter, which is a sign of its
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48889:13"/>
Maturity, and that you have obtained the Philosophical ☿, which is the true Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Dissolvent, then let it cool. That which resteth in the bottom of the Cucurbite, is the <hi>Terra damnata.</hi>

You must take great care that you lose nothing of the Spirits; it must be done in a Matrass with a Glass stopper, exactly fitted; and being well sealed and luted, digest it with a Lamp fire, with a very gentle heat in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. After fifty days digestion, you must feed and imbibe your Matter with the said <hi>Menstruum,</hi> whereof you must have store, for to multiply your Work. So soon as you have put in the said Dissolvent, you must stop it again immediately, and seal it as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, then digest fifty days more, the heat a little increased; which time being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, you must again feed your Matter with the Virginal Milk a little more than the first time, continuing the digestion, the heat a little stronger. Reiterate the Imbibition seven times, and your Matter will become more vigorous, and will be able to bear stronger Food from time to time, and to bear stronger heat, which nevertheless must

not be hastened, but well governed, after the Example of the Operation of the Rays of the Sun in the Spring and Summer, for the Nourishment and Maturation of Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables.

At the five first imbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions you shall see from time to time the wonderful effects of Nature, by the internal vertue of the Matter, and by all the Signs written in <hi>Flammel, La Tourbe, Le Rosaire,</hi> or <hi>Iubilation of the Soul,</hi> and in all those Authors that have possessed this rare Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which will appear infallibly; to the proportion whereof you must increase the fire, and that is left to the discretion of the Operator. You must observe, that as the Matter multiplieth in vertue and quantity at each imbibition, and always more and more, it might become so fusible, that at last it might penetrate the Glass; so that if you judge convenient, you need not imbibe quite seven times, that you may run no hazard; for you may afterwards multiply the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the same manner, and carry it <hi>ad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitum.</hi> And to perform all this, there needeth no more than about nine Months time, and without much trouble or care.</p>

Repeat this twice or thrice; then put one part of this fixed Salt to three parts of the Spirit, and to this Composition put a tenth part of pure ☉, and though it were in an Ingot, it will dissolve it speedily. Put this into an Egg, and Seal it Hermetically, and digest it, it will putrifie, and grow en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely black; then pass all the due colours, during which time increase the heat by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and when it requireth strong heat, use Coal.</p>

               <p>DIstill fifty or sixty quarts of Vinegar, and before you distill the Vinegar you must evaporate a fourth part of it, which is nothing but flegm; and for to render this distilled Vinegar more dissolving, it should be distilled once or twice from Lees.</p>
               <p>Take <abbr>lb</abbr>xij. or xv. of good <hi>English</hi> Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargy of Silver, reduce it into fine Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and put it into Matrasses of three or four quarts a piece, put <abbr>lb</abbr>j. into each Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trass; then pour upon the Powder so much of the distilled Vinegar, as may cover it the breadth of six Inches; then put them in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion, with the second degree of 🜂 for two days, shaking the Matrass three or four times a day, in which time the distilled Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar will be of a yellow colour, and very sweet. Then decant this distilled Vinegar impregnated with the Essence of ♄, and put on fresh upon the Lithargy; digest as before; then put in all the decanted Vinegar and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it, and distill in several Cucurbites with a gentle heat three parts of the distilled Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar; put the remainder in a Cellar, and in 24
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:48889:55"/>
hours the greater part of it will be congeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into a substance like Ice; it will suffice if you distill it off to a Syrup: Then upon this Syrup pour new distilled Vinegar, about the same quantity as before, digest twelve hours; then distill off about the quantity you put on: Put new distilled Vinegar upon the residue, somewhat more than the first time, digest and distill as before. Then pour upon it about half the quantity of the said distilled Vinegar that you put on before, digest and distill as before. Repeat this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion for twelve hours, and distillation so often, till you find that the distilled Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar come off in the beginning of the distil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation so strong as it was before, which is a sign of a perfect attraction of the universal dissolvent made by the distilled Vinegar.</p>
               <p>Then put your Gums which remained in the Cucurbites into one or several large Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trasses, which stop and lute well, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing may exhale; then put to digest in <hi>B. vapor.</hi> or <hi>in fimo</hi> (which change every six days) for twenty or thirty days, more or less; for the sign of a sufficient digestion is, when the Matter cometh to be black, and that it acquireth as it were a stinking scent, which is a sign of its Mortification, by which it ought to acquire a new Life, and a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual vesture. Then divide this Matter or
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:48889:56"/>
Ceruse into several parts, which put into se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Retorts, which you may do by causing the Matter to melt with some gentle heat, and then pouring it hot into the Retorts, for it easily congealeth by cold; and if any of it congeal about the necks of the Retorts, make it melt, and run down; the Retorts must be of such a bigness, that at least four parts of them may remain empty. Then distill off all the flegm with a very gentle heat in Sand, and so soon as you perceive any Fumes or Vapours, cease, and let all cool; then change the Recipient, putting on a large one, and having well luted it, and the lute dry, give the 🜂 by degrees, at last very strong and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, until you see no more fumes come over, but that an Oyl or Gum as red as Blood distill over. Take the feces remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Retorts (which will look like black Ashes) and extract the Salt out of them with distilled Vinegar, as you did with the Lithargy, which Salt will be in long Rocks like Rock-Salt-petre; and this Salt will be more subtil than the first: Distill this Salt in a Retort, putting what distilleth to the first Liquor; out of the feces extract again the Salt, of which distill also the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in a Retort. Proceed thus until the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining earth, or <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> giveth no more Salt. Then take all your Spirits,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:48889:56"/>
and mix them together, and put it in a large and high Cucurbite, which cover with a double paper Oyled and dryed; tye it well about the neck of the Cucurbite with a pack-thread, then put on the head, and lute well the junctures, put on a pretty large Reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pient, with a narrow and a short neck; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stil in <hi>B. vapor.</hi> and the AEthereal Spirit will pass over through the paper, and the flegm will stay behind, because it cannot pass through the Oyled paper; and if your Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit be not subtil enough, you may rectifie it once or twice with new Oyled paper; then keep it in a Vessel close stopped in a cold place: Then take off the Oyled paper, and distill the rest of the Liquor to the consistence of a red Syrup; put the Cucurbite with the Syrup in a Cellar, and in two days time there will be many little Crystals very white, which separate, and wash them in the flegm, and they will be white and pure: Then put the flegm to that which remained in the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curbite, and distill to a Syrup, which put in a Cellar to Crystallize as before: Cleanse and wash the Crystals to whiten them, then put them together upon white paper to dry them for two days in the shadow; then put them in a Cucurbite narrow and somewhat high, and pour upon them of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned AEthereal Spirit, so much as may

Repeat this cohobation and distillation four times, at the fourth time the said Gum will distill over in the form of an Oyl as white as snow, swimming upon the Spirit: This Oyl is the true and only dissolvent of ☉, separate it from the Spirit by a Funnel. And thus you shall have the Philosophical <hi>Menstruum,</hi> the Vegetable, and Mineral Salt, <hi>Aurora Dianae,</hi> and the true Philosophical ☿, and the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous 🜄, dissolving the two <hi>Luminaries</hi> into a Physical dissolution, with which you may prepare Medicines both for Health, and for Projection to transmute Metals, which will be both short and easie, as followeth.</p>
               <p>'Tis not enough to have the <hi>Menstruum</hi> or Philosophical 🜄, for it serveth only for an Agent or a means to excite the Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive quality which is hidden and buryed in the occult Secrets of the Metalline Nature.

               <p>Prepare then a slight, spungy, well opened, and attenuated Calx of ☉, which put in a small Cucurbite, and pour upon it so much of the afore-mentioned white Oyl as will co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it a fingers breadth; digest two or three days with a gentle heat, then distill over all the Oyl, then pour the Spirit upon the Calx: Then pour upon this Matter four or five times as much of the above-mentioned Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; digest twenty four hours, and the Spirit will be tincted of a pure red colour, more red than any Ruby, which decant, and dry the remaining Matter, and pour upon it the same Oyl, and digest twenty four hours, and it will be very red. Repeat this so long till your ☉ will yield no more tincture. Then Circulate all your Tinctures in a Pelican for thirty days, and then separate the clear from an Hypostace which will be at the bottom, and you shall have the true <hi>Aurum potabile,</hi> which will be of an admirable vertue, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king three or four drops of it at a time in a little Sack, or other fit vehicle.</p>
               <p>But for the Work, you must separate the Spirit by distillation in <hi>Balneo,</hi> until the Tincture remain in the bottom in consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

Note, that within fifteen days this Sea or Butter cometh to be very red, with a gentle heat of a Lamp 🜂 in Ashes; and this is <hi>Flamel</hi>'s Red Sea. This AEthereal 🜄 penetrates all Metalline Bodies, (being Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated and made red-hot) and tingeth them into <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>. Two drops of this 🜄 being dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in ℥iv. of Spirit of Wine, maketh a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Milk, whereof the Dose is a spoonful: It is a very gentle Emetick, because of its crudity, or rather <hi>Mercurial</hi> Substance, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the vertue Operates upwards, because it is moist and Airy. It Cures the Epilepsie by the Character which is imprinted into it, by the word <hi>Fiat,</hi> and all astral Diseases, as far as humane disposition permits. This is the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:48889:71"/>

                  </expan>, but it requires more Work. Take this 🜄 (you must have a pretty great quantity of it, and therefore you must have ten, fifteen, or twenty pound of Volatile Crystals) and put it in a Cucurbite, and with a very gentle heat of a Lamp distill off all the waterish moistness, which by careles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness it might have contracted from the Air: There will remain in the bottom a Gum, a Syrup, a viscous 🜄, a Radical Mineral moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, which is the Eagles gluten above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, which did fly the space of fifty days continually; by means of this gentle heat, the Gluten flies no more, but is the flying <hi>Crapant</hi> and <hi>Zacair</hi>'s <hi>Mercurial</hi> 🜄, which is congealed by cold, and liquified by heat. The Authors before mentioned have digested this Gluten <hi>per se</hi> in a Matrass Hermetically Sealed, without the addition of a Solary Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but afterwards they have been forced to ferment the Powder which they made of it. For to shorten the Work, take seven parts, or nine or ten, or more of this Glu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, unto which by heat joyn one part of ☉ in leaf, or Sulphur of ☉ prepared by the Salt <hi>Enixe</hi> (which is best) and digest in an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanor,</hi> or in <hi>Flamel</hi>'s Furnace (which is
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:48889:72"/>
very easie) until all the Matter have passed through all the due colours, and come to be of a purple Citrine colour; then have you the Metalline Salt, the most high Tincture, a Treacle made of Venom, a most Excellent Medicine made of the greatest Poison. This Medicine is multiplyed in quantity by new addition of the afore-mentioned Gluten; in quality, by dissolving <hi>in humido</hi> into a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, and purifying by digestion, and then by fixation; Experience will teach other things far better. This Method, although it differs much from that of the greatest Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers, as <hi>Lully, Trevesan, Cosmopolite,</hi> &amp;c. (and being but particular in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of that high <hi>Generalissima</hi>) nevertheless it seems to be Universal in regard of Metals and Minerals. Note, that you may also ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract a white and red Oyl of that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, as was said before, and make a new aurifique stone thereof, which those Authors have not understood, or if they have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood it, they have not spoken of it. Note also, that this Mineral 🜄 of Paradise, is the Philosophers live ☉, and the ☿ of the Wise, but not the <hi>Generalissima</hi>: And this 🜄 will serve against all Maladies, for it drives them out, according to the intention and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Nature.</p>

               <head>An Explanation of this Figure.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> IS the whole Fabrick, which may be Built (of good Bricks) about two foot four inches in length; one foot six in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in breadth; and about two foot four inches high.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>B.</hi> Is the fire place, which must be round, of the best and hardest Bricks (it may also be made of a fire stone) it must be eight inches deep, and eight inches diameter; at the bottom of it you may lay either a close grate, or a thick Iron Plate full of holes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>C.</hi> Is the Ash-hole &amp; Receptacle of the blast or wind issuing from the Bellows, which must
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:48889:81"/>
be very close, and the stopper fit the mouth of it exactly, to shut very close, so that the wind may find no vent any where out but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards through the grate; this hole needeth be but four inches deep, from the grate down to the bottom; the Ashes must be taken out of it from time to time, that they may not stuff up the place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>D.</hi> Is the Coppelling-place, which may be about seven or eight inches in length, and six inches wide, and about four or five in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches deep.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>E.</hi> Is the gap, through which the flame reverberates from the Furnace into the Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling-place, it is about four inches wide, about two or three deep, and two inches in length.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>F.</hi> is the Pipe or Chimney, which draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the flame.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>G.</hi> Is a hole, through which you may put Fewel into the Furnace, to avoid uncover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, when it is covered, as it must be when you Coppel; you must have a stopper exactly fitted to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>H.</hi> Is a hollow place under the Coppel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-place, which may serve to put Coals in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I.</hi> Is an Iron Hoop about an inch high, such as the Refiners use to make Coppels in, you may have them of what bigness you
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:48889:82"/>
please; at the bottom are fastened two flat Iron Bars, to hold the bone-ashes, having no other bottom.</p>
               <p>To use this Furnace, you must have a pair of Smiths Bellows, of a midling size; which (if there be not room in your La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boratory to fix them below) you may fix above ground, and so they will not incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber your Operatory below; and for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting of the Wind, you may have a square Pipe of Wood, made like an Organ-pipe, to come down from the nose of the Bellows through the Wall of the Furnace into the Ash-hole; and to the pearch you may tye a piece of Rope with a wooden handle at the end, to pull by in blowing the said Bellows.</p>
               <p>In all the Operations I do in this Furnace (even when I Coppel) I use nothing but small Sinder from the Glass-House, which are not so heady as Charcoal.</p>

when you press them in your hand; stamp them well down with the end of an Iron Pestle, and make the Coppel very close and hard every where, then make it hollow in the middle, that it may hold the Matter you mean to Coppel without running over; make it very smooth, then set it into the Coppelling-place, and raise it with any sifted Ashes, or with a piece of a fire-stone, so that the top of it may be level with the lower part of the gap. Then cover the Coppel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-place with two bricks, (I use two bricks, because I can lift up one of them to put the Metal into the Coppel, and leaving the other brick, the Coppel is not all uncovered, as it would be if it were covered with one whole stone.) Then having kindled the 🜂 in the Furnace, cover it as before, and blow the Bellows, and the flame finding no way out, is forced and driven into the Coppelling-place, where it reverberates upon the Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, which when you see that it is well nealed, lift up one end of the hithermost brick, and put in the ♄, the quantity whereof must be proportioned according to the impurity of the Matter you mean to Coppel; if it be <hi>Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> 
                  <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>, you must take four parts of ♄ to one of <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>; if it be any other mixture of impure Metal, you must take five, six, or seven parts of ♄ to one of the Metal, according to the

impurity of it. Govern the 🜂 so, that the Coppel may always work and flow, and you may leave a little space between the two bricks, through which you may look into the Coppel to see how it worketh, and if you see that it requires more flame than the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, or Charcoal will afford, you may put into the Furnace a round thick piece of wood; but you must observe, that when the Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling-place is come to be red-hot all over, and the bricks also that cover it, the Coppel will then work with a very gentle 🜂, so that then you must blow but gently; for if then you should give strong 🜂, the Matter in the Coppel would boyl too fast, and would spat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter about.</p>
               <p>Instead of an Iron Hoop, many times I use but an earthen Porringer, to make a Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, filling up the Coppelling-place with any Ashes round about the Coppel, and find that it doth altogether as well, only that it serves but for once. Note, that whilst you Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, or neal the Coppel, you may make <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulus,</hi> if you have occasion, or melt any other Metal at the same time. This Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace doth far exceed any ordinary Wind-furnace; for I can at any time make a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of <hi>Regulus,</hi> or melt any Metal before the 🜂 would kindle in an ordinary Wind-fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, and that with much less charge.

this Furnace you may distill with a luted Retort in a naked 🜂, by leaving two little holes in the Wall of it to put two small Iron bars in, to set the Retort upon; you may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so distill in it, in Sand, both in a Retort and in a Cucurbite, by putting an Iron Pot into the Furnace with Sand, and laying some Brick with Clay about the Pot, to inclose that part of the Pot (or luted Retort) that stands out of the Furnace, and you may give what degrees of 🜂 you will, from the first and lowest, to the fourth and highest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</p>

               <p>HE took but <abbr>lb</abbr>j. of Tartar well Calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and dissolved it in the Air, free from the Sun, then filtred, and congealed in a Glass Vessel, then the Calcined it as the <hi>Dutch-man</hi> doth (in the next Process) to keep it glowing hot for six or eight hours, then dissolved it again in the Air, and filtred,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:48889:87"/>
congealed, and calcined as before. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated this ten times, then dissolved it in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilled Vinegar (he used <hi>Spanish</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Vinegar;) the whole Secret (as he saith) consisteth in well distilling of the Vinegar, which must be done in <hi>B. M.</hi> but it must be so gentle, that you may receive the flegm by it self; and as soon as you perceive that the drops come Acid, change the Recipient, putting on another, and then distill the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit with a stronger fire, so that you may tell eight or nine between every drop: Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue distilling until it become like a Syrup, then change the Recipient again, and distill with a stronger fire until it begin to smell of the fire, and that it be almost dry. Recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie this last and strongest part by it self, and put it to the weaker part, (keeping the flegm by it self for another use) and recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie it together so often until there remain not the least spot at the bottom of the Glass after the distillations, which must be to dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness every time, and every time in a clean Retort: This is not a strong Spirit of Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, nor needs it be, but this will do the Work. Then take ℥vij. or viij. of your Salt of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, and dissolve it in as much of the said Spirit, or more, as will dissolve it; let it stand, and it will settle some black feces; then filter it, and congeal, and calcine it as
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:48889:87"/>
before, but not with so strong a fire; it must be scarce red-hot, and one hour will suffice; grind it while it is hot, and dissolve it again in new distilled Vinegar as before, let the feces settle, then filter it, congeal and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine again as before. Repeat this, till it leave no feces behind, which will be in Seven or Eight times, if you have wrought well; then when it is very dry, take ℥j. of it to make a tryal, put it into a clean Glass body, and pour upon it so much high rectified Spirit of Wine, as will not only moisten it, but that it be very thin; let it stand thus twenty four hours close stopped in a very gentle heat, that it may be but Blood-warm; then distill with a gentle fire. If the Spirit stays, and the flegm come away, then proceed with the whole parcel; but if not, you must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the dissolution in distilled Vinegar, Filtration, Coagulation, and Calcination, as before, until you find (by trying) that the Spirit stayeth with the Salt, which it will do in a few times: Then proceed with the rest of the parcel in the same manner as you did with the Ounce; continue the imbibition and distillation with Spirit of Wine so often, till the Spirit of Wine come away as strong as it was put on. Then here lyeth the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, to Sublime it: Dissolve the said Salt of Tartar impregnated in the flegm of your
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:48889:88"/>
distilled Vinegar, or in a very weak Spirit of Wine, using no more of the dissolvent than will dissolve it; shake them well toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and it will instantly dissolve all the best and finest part of the Salt of Tartar, and leave the course part of it, for that will not so easily dissolve. Pour off the dissolution, and filter it, then put it into a Cucurbite, and distill off the flegm off the Vinegar, or the weak Spirit of Wine, and then will the dry Spirit, or <hi>Aqua Sicca</hi> ascend like the purest Isickles dry that ever you saw; and this is the true Volatile Salt of Tartar, and Spirit of Wine, <hi>in forma Salis,</hi> and is the Vegetable <hi>Menstruum,</hi> which will dissolve leaf ☉ into an Oylish Substance in a very gentle heat.</p>
               <p>The Tartar which remaineth in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of this Sublimation you must put to that which was left undissolved by the flegm of Vinegar, or weak Spirit of Wine, and proceed to fix more Spirit of Wine upon that, being first Calcined, but not so long, nor with so strong a fire as formerly; and then dissolve it once in the Air, and it will leave more feces at this time than at any time before; then filter and congeal, and dissolve it in distilled Vinegar as before. And now you shall do more in three times than you did all the times before, for the Tartar is
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:48889:88"/>
altered in its Nature; then proceed with it as before, imbibing with <hi>S. V.</hi> And thus you may fix as much <hi>S. V.</hi> as you please, and Sublime as many pure and clear Crystals as you please.</p>
               <p>Note, That when your Spirit of Wine is fixed on the Tartar, it will be as sweet as Sugar; but when it is separated, as above-said, the Tartar will be of its old Nature, but fit to be impregnated again with much less trouble.</p>

then gently distills it off, but the Spirit of Wine ascendeth, and will not stay; when it is dry, he puts the Spirit of Wine back again upon it, and distilleth as before; and this he doth so often (twelve or fourteen times) and then it will hold the Spirit of Wine, and the flegm will come away: This he doth with new Spirit of Wine; and when he findeth that a pretty quantity is congealed with the Tartar, he grinds it (being very dry) and mixeth it with three parts of good Bole-Armony, and puts it into a Retort, and distilleth a Spirit from it by degrees of fire, forcing it strongly at last, and it will be a yellow Spirit, which he deflegmeth once, and then dissolveth his Calx of ☉ in this <hi>Menstruum,</hi> which by digestion extracts all the Tincture of ☉, and leaveth the Body white, tinging it self of a pure red.

to Celifie in the Air. As soon as it is cold, it will be hard, but the Air will resolve it: Make thus what quantity of Honey you please: Celifie them four days, then have another earthen Pot, covered with a rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed one that hath a hole in the bottom, fasten thereon a neck of a Cucurbite of Glass, ten or twelve inches long, upon which a Retort, with the bottom out for a head, to which fasten a great ballon.

After you have drawn off the Spirit and the flegm, evaporate the residue (very gently) <hi>usque ad pelliculam,</hi> then set in a cold place, and in fifteen days there were many Crystals in it; wash these with the flegm of the Wine, from the blackness and foulness that is upon them.

He doth thus:</p>
               <p>Set Equinox Rain 🜄 (pure Dew were better) to putrifie in Glass Vessels, slightly
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:48889:92"/>
covered (only to keep things from falling in) in a Cellar; in six weeks the putrefaction will be finished, and all the feces fallen to the bottom; filter it, set the clear to putrifie again, which will require longer time than before: If you put some quick dry Sand in it, it will help the putrefaction much the sooner, drawing down the foulness to it. In this purified 🜄 dissolve your Salt, Vitriol, Salt of Urine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And you must have a Gallon of this water to ℥j. of Salt; for such dilating of the Salt maketh the <hi>Menstruum</hi> lighter than the feces, and therefore they fall down. <hi>Mark the end of</hi> Isaac Hollands <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess upon Vitriol, where he directeth dissolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in fair 🜄 distilled off</hi>; then filter and congeal, and this you may repeat two or three times: Then take nine parts of this pure Salt, and put to them one part of pure Spirit of Wine, digest them together for seven or eight days, then distill off the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor very gently, and about fourteen or fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen parts will come off in insipid flegm, and only one part, or a little more will remain with the Salt in a dry substance. Repeat this nine times with fresh Spirit of Wine, till you have employed as much Spirit of Wine as you wrought upon Salt, which will be increased scarce one part: Put it then to Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime, and every whit of it will rise in a pure
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:48889:93"/>
Sublimate, excepting a small parcel of feces that will remain in the bottom: You may multiply this Sublimate as much as you will, by addition of Spirit of Wine to it; then distilling away the Liquor, for the 🜹 of the Spirit of Wine will adhere to the pure Salt in a pure Saline form, and the rest will come away in an insipid flegm. But in the end, this Salt will be apt to come over in an Oily Liquor, and sometimes after that, in form of Salt again: But he cannot yet penetrate into the Causes of these Bodies coming over sometimes liquid, sometimes dry.

They had put her into the hands of the ablest Physitians in <hi>England,</hi> who in effect could do her no good. A Gentleman, one of their Neighbours, undertook to Cure her, and performed the Cure thus: Take true Misletoe of the Oak, the Leaves, the Berries, and all the tender Branches; dry it gently in an Oven after the Bread is drawn; then reduce it to a fine Powder, of which give as much as will lye upon a shilling for one of ripe years; for middle aged, a six-pence, for a Child, a groat: Give it Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Evenings in Cowslip-water three days before, and three days after the Full of the Moon.

               <p>Hartman.) <hi>I cannot omit to relate here a Story, which I have often heard Sir</hi> Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelm Digby <hi>tell concerning a Famous Cure of a desperate Dropsie, done by Dr.</hi> Farrar <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an eminent Lord, who was over-grown with the Dropsie, his Belly and Stomach swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to a Prodigious bigness, and was given over by the ablest Physicians as incurable. Sir</hi> K. D. <hi>made the bargain between the Lord and the Doctor, who was to have five hundred pounds for the Cure: But when the Lord was Cured, he would give the Doctor no more than three hundred pounds, saying, that five hundred pounds was too much money, and that all the Ingredients he used could not stand him in twenty shillings.</hi> The Remedies were thus: Having first well purged the Patient with some fit Purge (as of <hi>Iallap, Manna, Sena</hi>) to carry away watry humours, he gave him the following Broth. A moderate Broth was made of Mutton, Chickens, and Capon, or Hen, but not Veal; the Broth was not strong of the Meat, nor too weak, but such as the Patient might drink all the day, for he was to drink no other Liquor; they made but about a pottle of Broth at a time, for it would not keep: And for this quantity they took a Gallon of Water, into
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:48889:114"/>
which the Doctor put above a handful of Garlick, and Rosemary, Penyroyal, Thyme, Sweet-marjoram, Fennel-roots, Parsley-roots, as also Currans, and a sufficient quantity of Salt. And after some days taking the Broth, they put into every draught of the Broth (the Patient took) above a spoonful of the crude juice of Garlick, stamped and pressed out. But if you cannot bear always to drink this Broth, then use the following De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction: Take <hi>Sarsaparilla</hi> ℥xij. <hi>China</hi>-roots ℥v. <hi>Sassafras</hi> ℥iij. Cut all these very small, and pour upon them Spring-water, to three fingers breadth above the Ingredients, and let them infuse over a soft fire the space of four hours; then throw away this Water, and stamp the Ingredients in a Stone Mortar with a wooden Pestle: Then pour upon them ten quarts of Fountain-water, and boyl it in a Vessel close stopped, till four quarts of it be consumed: Of this Decoction let the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient drink, without any other drink but the Garlick Broth.</p>

<pb n="203" facs="tcp:48889:114"/>
hang it in the Beer; ℥j. of the Ingredients is sufficient for a quart of Beer. Either of these Drinks is only in case the Patient can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bear the use of the Garlick Broth, which alone will dispatch the Cure much the soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and this course of the Garlick Broth is for all Obstructions, and superfluity of Cold, raw Humours, clogging the Brain, or any other part, as well as for the Dropsie. To strengthen and secure the Liver, use the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Electuary. Take of Powder of Turmerick a sufficient quantity, make an Electuary of it with Sugar, and to every Ounce of it add three drops of Oyl of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niseed, made by distillation; and if you put a little <hi>Amber-grease</hi> to it, it will be the more strengthening. Take of this Electuary two or three times a day the quantity of a Hasle-nut; take not above ℥j. in a day.</p>
               <p>Besides this, to strengthen the Stomach, use the following Stomacher: Take Worm-wood, Marjoram, Rosemary, Rue, <hi>ana</hi> one handful; Cloves, Cinamon, Mace, <hi>ana</hi> ℥j. bruise these Spices, and mix them with the Herbs; of these make a Stomacher, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it: And you may likewise anoint your Stomach, and region of the Liver with Oyl of Nutmegs and Oyl of Roses.</p>

               </p>
               <p>I Do not tell you that I have been Sick, (and that I am so still) to Excuse my self for having so long deferred an Answer unto your last two Letters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is true nevertheless, for I have laboured under di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Distempers; but among the rest, I have been ill of the Stone, and have had a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan Ague: I believe you will not be sorry to hear how I Cured my self of both with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of any Physician. For the Stone I took twelve grains of the Salt made of the Stones which were taken out of Men; I dissolved the said Salt in a little water, and then I put all into a Glass of White-wine, and drank it off, and walked about my Chamber near two hours, at the end where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I had a great need to make water, and I voided (with violence) a large Glass full of Gravel, which was so gross, and so rug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that it caused me to void near a Pint of Blood; the same thing happened to me three times, and every time I voided Blood, which made me judge that I should have taken less
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:48889:116"/>
of the said Salt; yet I took it but once, but I felt a great pain and heaviness in my Reins and Kidneys. The said Stones were Calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in a Potters Oven, and after they were Calcined, I extracted the Salt out of them with distilled Rain-water: The feces I Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cined again, and extracted the Salt as before, which I repeated so often, till the said Stones yielded no more Salt. Note, That to make this Salt for a Man, you must take the stones taken out of Men, and for a Woman, those that are taken out of Women. And thus was the first Cure performed.</p>
               <p>As for the Quartan Ague, without having been Purged, or let Blood, at the fourth fit I took a Glass-full of the water of green Wall-nuts, which I had distilled in their last Season: I took it as soon as I perceived the least symptom of the Fits approaching; I went to Bed, and caused my self to be well covered, and slept, and had no Fit at all that time, nor ever after.</p>
               <p>The Water I distilled thus: I took green Wall-nuts and beat them in a stone Mortar, then in a Cucurbite in <hi>B. M.</hi> I distilled the water from them, which I cohobated twice upon fresh Wall-nuts. Then having Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cined the three Marcs or <hi>Caput Mortuums,</hi> I extracted the Salt out of the Ashes; this Salt I put into the distilled water. I thus,

When it is well settled, pour off the clear water, which keep for Use. Pour the remaining milky thick substance upon <abbr>lb</abbr>j. of Hogs-grease melted in an earthen Pot; the grease must be very hot when you pour in the dissolved ☿; but take the Pot from
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:48889:132"/>
the fire when you pour the ☿ to it, and stir it well all the while you are pouring it in; and when it is all in, set the Pot upon the fire again to boil the grease, till all the moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture of the <hi>Mercurial</hi> Substance and Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is evaporated away, but be sure you stir it all the while, as also after you take it from the fire (which you must do as soon as the moisture is gone) till the grease is cold and hardened.</p>
               <p>The way of using this Oyntment and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to Cure all sorts of Tetters, Herps, or any Scabby Itches, or Inflamed red Faces or Noses, is thus:</p>
               <p>First, if the Evil be very great, Purge and let Blood strongly; then begin with the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, rub the Tetters, and all about it with Linnen dipped in the Water made as hot as you can endure it; and when you have rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed and bathed it well, lay upon it Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses wetted in the water. Do thus twice a day for two or three days, or more, till you see it hath drawn out the Salt Humour abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, and that the part is much inflamed, and very sore, and hath little holes or Ulcers eaten in it. Presently after the first wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it will grow very sore and Inflamed; therefore you must not afterwards rub it so hard as at first, but very gently. Some Sores will require that you use the Water five
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:48889:133"/>
or six days, others more, tender ones two or three days. When you judge that the Water hath drawn out sufficiently the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Matter, then anoint with the grease as hot as you can endure it, and lay on it a Plaister of the same Oyntment, binding it on. This Oyntment will presently asswage the pain, and take away the Inflammation. Dress it with it twice or thrice a day. Much Matter will run from the Sore, as from an Ulcer; and by little and little it will heal up. And that which is wonderful is, that whereas one would think that such deep holes as the Water will have eaten, should have scars, there will not appear the least mark of them, but a fine new tender Natural skin will come over it all.</p>

               <p>The way of using this Powder to Cure the above-mentioned Diseases is thus:</p>

<pb n="240" facs="tcp:48889:134"/>
you may let Blood the next day, then two days after that repeat the Purge, and two days after you may begin with the Powder; taking gr. viij. of it for five Mornings to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, the Powder being mixt with a little Conserve of Roses, let the Patient take it upon the point of a Knife in the Morning in his Bed, and drink after it immediately a Glass-full of the following Decoction as hot as he can drink it; let him keep his Bed, and he will be in a gentle breathing Sweat for an hour; which being past, let him be rubbed with warm Clothes, his Legs, Thighs, Arms, Shoulders, and the Back; then let him keep his Bed for an hour longer, to see if he will sweat any more: The sweat being quite over, he may rise, and go about his business, as at other times. After those five days the Dose of the Powder must be increased, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king twelve grains of it for other five Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and then you must come again to eight grains for five Mornings more. When you begin with the twelve grains after the first five Doses, you must drink a little more of the Sudorifick Decoction than before, and taking the Powder then in a little Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Alkermes. You may also increase the Dose of the Powder by degrees (as Sir <hi>K. D.</hi> observes) taking (for example) gr.x. the sixth day, and gr. xij. the other three
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:48889:134"/>
days following; then gr. x. the tenth day, and so come again to gr. viij. the eleventh day. One may take gr. xx. of it at one time without inconveniency. The first Purge the Author giveth, is a Decoction of Succory and Tamarinds, with infusion of two Drams of <hi>Sena,</hi> and being strained, dissolveth in it ℥j. of Syrup of Peach-flowers. The Second is the same, adding only of Confection of Hamech, or of Confection of Citron; or you may increase a little the Dose of <hi>Sena,</hi> and of the Syrup, if one is not willing to take any thing where there is <hi>Scammony</hi> in. The Sudorifick Decoction the Author maketh use of with this Powder, is thus:</p>
               <p>Take <hi>Sarsaparilla</hi> ℥ij. <hi>China-root</hi> ℥j. <hi>Sas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safras</hi> ℥ss. <hi>Santal Citrine</hi>

               <p>Note, That if you put a little Salt of Tartar into the water when you put the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients in, it will extract the Vertue and Tincture out of them much the better; as also in making any Purgative Decoction, if you infuse them over-night with a little Salt of Tartar put in the water, and then boyling

               <p>
                  <pb n="250" facs="tcp:48889:139"/>Take Quick-lime grosly beaten, put a bed of it about two fingers thick into the bottom of a Cucurbite; then dissolve <abbr>lb</abbr>j. of <hi>Sal armoniac</hi> in as much water as will dissolve it: Pour of this dissolution upon the Quick-lime (having first placed the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curbite in the Furnace in Sand) so much as may dissolve it well, and swim half a fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers breadth over it. Then be as quick as you can in fitting on the Head and Reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pient (for it will immediately begin to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>still without fire) lute all the junctures well, and distill with a gentle fire, keeping the subtil Spirit by it self, which cometh first. If any flegm should come over with the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Spirit, rectifie it in <hi>Balneo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This Spirit is not only good for benumbed heads to smell to, but also to take inwardly, for it is a most Excellent Remedy: It opens all Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, it is Sudorifick and Diuretick. 'Tis very good in Fevers, especially the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid, in Palsies, Epilepsies, Hysterical Fits, and the Plague, resisting all Corruption, in Lethargy, and stupification of the Spirits. The Dose is from eight to thirty drops. It also asswages the pain of the Gout, being mixt with</hi> S. V. <hi>or Brandy, and Linnen Clothes dipt in it, and laid upon the parts afflicted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hartman.) <hi>In distilling of this Spirit this way, I have observed several inconveniences;
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:48889:139"/>
the first is, that if you use a Glass Cucurbite, it will be apt to crack by the sudden heat of the Quick-lime, caused by pouring on the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of the 🜹 (and an earthen Cucurbite will imbibe it.) Secondly, by the same Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son you lose a great part of the subtilest Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which will ascend before you have poured in the quantity of the dissolution above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and before you can fit on the Head and Recipient. To prevent all these incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences, I make use of a Tin Cucurbite, with a Spout in the upper part</hi> (See it in the third Figure) <hi>and having placed it in the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace in Sand, I put in the Quick-lime, and then I fit a Glass Head and Recipient, and having well luted all the junctures with wet Bladders, or Paste and Paper, I pour in the dissolution of 🜹 by a funnel through the Spout; then I close the Spout, and distill with a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle fire. When the distillation is over, take out the</hi> Caput Mortuum, <hi>and make the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curbite clean, and wipe it dry, that it may not rust or canker, and it will serve for many other Operations, and will save you the buying of many Glass Cucurbites, which by reason of their thick and knobbed bottoms are so apt to break.</hi>

               <p>He caused a good quantity of the Herb Mullein (<hi>Verbascum</hi> in <hi>Latin</hi>) to be gathered every Summer when it was in its Flower, which is in <hi>Iune,</hi> it beareth many yellow Flowers upon a long straight stalk with large leaves at the bottom, which are hoary. Then he took a good quantity of this Herb, and cut it small; the Stalk, Flowers, and Leaves, and caused it to be boyled in a pail-full of Forge-water out of a Smith's trough, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he quenches and cooleth his Irons; when this was boyled sufficiently, then there was put into it a large piece of Chalk in Powder. In this Water he bathed his Feet, Leggs, and Knees, as hot as he could endure it, in a Tub, continuing until the Water grew cold. Then a hole was digged in the ground in his Garden, wherein this Water was put with the Ingredients, and then covered with Earth.</p>
               <p>This always prevented his Fit, so that he
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:48889:145"/>
never had any pain, lameness, or swelling at all, to which I was an Eye-witness. And I heard him say, that if he did not use this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, he would have very shrewd and rack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fits, and keep his Bed by it for a Month or six weeks, and that twice a Year, chiefly in the Spring, and at the Falling of the Leaf.</p>

               <p>TAke what quantity you please of good <hi>English</hi> Vitriol, dissolve it in warm wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but use no more water than will dissolve it, leaving some of the impurest part at the bottom undissolved: Then filter the disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and evaporate it until you see a thin skin upon it, then put it in a cool place, and let it stand without stirring it for two or three days, covering it loosely only, to keep things from falling in. It will shoot into fair, green, and large Crystals, which take out, and spread them abroad in a large flat earthen Dish, and expose them to the heat of the Sun in the Dog days, turning them often, and the Sun will Calcine them white; when you see them all white without, beat them grosly, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose them again to the Sun, securing them

from Rain; when they are well Calcined, powder them finely, and expose this Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der again to the Sun, turning and stirring it often. Continue this until it be reduced to a white Powder, which put up in a Glass, and tye it up close, and keep it in a dry place.</p>
               <p>As for the Vertues of this Powder, I will only say, that I have seen great Experience of it in my time, in stanching of desperate bleeding at the Nose. 2. In stanching the Blood of a Wound. 3. In Curing with it any green Wound (where there is no fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of Bones) without any Plaister or Oyntment, in a few days.</p>
               <p>A Girl about twelve Years of Age bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing desperately at the Nose for two or three days together, her Mother having used all the means she could devise (in vain) came to me, telling me, that she had heard I had a Powder that would stanch Bleeding, she desired me to let her have a little of it, for she feared her Daughter would bleed to Death: I gave her some of the Powder, and bid her put a little of it in three or four spoonfuls of fair water, and to bath her No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strils with it with a clean Linnen rag, putting it up into the Nostrils, which she did, and her bleeding stopped immediately; the next day she did bleed a little again, and then using
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:48889:150"/>
it again, it did stanch it, and she never bled again afterwards.</p>
               <p>I spoke with a Famous Chirurgeon, named Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> in the City of <hi>Augusta</hi> in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> who told me, that he had a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect for Sir <hi>K. D.</hi> Books, and that he made his Sympathetical Powder every Year, and did all his Chiefest Cures with it in green wounds, with much greater ease to the Patient than if he had used Oyntments or Plaisters.</p>
               <p>If the Reader desires to know more of the Effects of this Powder, and the Reason of it, I refer him to the Reading of Sir <hi>K. Digby</hi>'s Treatise of Curing of Wounds by way of Sympathy, where he will find entire satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and full information of the Reasons of its effects.</p>
