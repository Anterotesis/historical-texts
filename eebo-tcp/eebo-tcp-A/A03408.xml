            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>OR me O noble and renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Englande to write to thee, that hath bredde and brought for the so many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, honourable, wise, and learned menne, who bee not onely moste expert, in all po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litique gouernement, but also moste happely furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed eache waie, with all maner of knowledge, cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng and wisedome, throughly seen in all the noble sciences &amp; artes liberall. Bothe thou and thei maie thinke (and thinke it truely) ouer muche boldnesse, and meere arrogancie in me, that neither am furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed of good letters, knowledge, histories, or other meane, to make a plausable waie of that, or for that I wishe should haue good successe at thy handes, or good opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at theirs. Muche more I am afraid lest thou hold it outrage and presumption, for me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate vnto thee, and trouble thee, with the patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage &amp; defence of this my deuice: a frutlesse thyng

But sithence I am voide of presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, all maner of waies (God be my record) &amp; am one of thyne owne broode fostered vp with the fatt of thy loynes, and take not vpon me to discourse of vanities, but of the settyng out of part of thy flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng goodnesse, that hath so enbalmed this thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion with secret richesse, though a worlde of eyes be poryng in my face, I trust in thyne owne cause, and for thyn owne sake, and goodnesse of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it self, and for sutche reasons and argumentes, as I haue sette doune, to finde a greate nomber of willyng hartes, and well disposed myndes (that with open mouthe will confesse the inuention sound and good, and the meane to bryng it to passe bothe easie and profitable) to further their natiue soile, and the benefite thereof, with this my simple ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I take in hande, in displeiyng parte of thy ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chesse. And therefore the graue and wise menne of this lande, of their good grace and fauour, I trust vndoubtedly will accepte and take in good parte, this my good will and long trauell, and shroude &amp; defende me and my Booke, vnder the winges of their wisedome, as vnder a sure Anker holde, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the rashe opinions of those, that rather wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully

then wisely, will imagine no politique proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion can come, from the Skonse of a Soldioure, that hath trailed the Pike. But as God raiseth instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes to sette out his glorie diuerse waies, and by diuerse degrees. So lette it not bee greeuous to thee O Englande, nor to the better sorte of menne, that one of thyne owne (though not so finely as others) dooe sette abroade parte of thy richesse, wealthe, and glory to enriche thy owne peculiar people with all, and hath opened the golden streame, of thy se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete store house, to the Inhabitauntes of the same. But likewise open thou, by thy Deuine prouidence the hartes of the wise, graue, and riche of this land that thei will affecte it, embrace it, putte their hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyng handes to it, and willyngly further it, by all possible meanes thei can, for the common profite of the inhabitauntes. In as mutche as by Gods mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, so greate a benefite, is offered with small care, little toile, and no coste, to make all this lande bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, the people therof happie, strong, and inuincible.

the matter, I desire you should knowe. Therefore commendyng the goodnesse thereof to your wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and me to your fauourable exposition I ende.
