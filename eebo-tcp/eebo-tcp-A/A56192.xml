         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

attempts of any mortall whatsoever, against them. I have
therefore by authority of Parliament published these ensuing
<hi>Letters, Warrants, Papers,</hi> extant under His Majesties own, <hi>His</hi>
Councells, Secretaries, <hi>Hands</hi> and <hi>Signets,</hi> with sundry <hi>Orders</hi>
made in open <hi>Court</hi> by <hi>Royall direction,</hi> for protection of <hi>Popish Recusants, Priests,
Jesuits,</hi> against the many good <hi>Laws</hi> enacted to suppresse them; by means whereof, and
of his <hi>Marriage Articles,</hi> that dangerous <hi>Traiterous Faction</hi> hath grown so power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
great by degrees, and insinuated so far into the <hi>Kings affections,</hi> that they now
threaten a sudden extirpation of the Protestant <hi>Party</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> out of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties

of our own <hi>English Protestant blood;</hi> especially by the late sending for and landing of
<hi>Irish Rebels</hi> to destroy us.</p>
            <p>It seems a strange <hi>mystery of Iniquity</hi> to me; First, that from the beginning of His
<hi>Majesties</hi> reign till this present Parliament, the most zealous, conscientious, pious <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants</hi>
have been continually persecuted under the Title of <hi>Puritans</hi> (the better to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour

proceedings as speciall Agent for advancing Your Majesties Revenue arising by the
Forfeitures or Compositions with Popish Recusants in the Southerne parts of this

at my request, and for the better <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>nabling me to proceed in the service, did
signe letters (which I then presented unto them ready written) directed to the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices
of Peace within all the severall Counties for convicting of all Recusants, as by
the said Letters may appeare.<note place="margin">The reason of both these stais of proceedings was, because the Papists should not be diverted from their contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which they were then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king for me.</note> But about two or three dayes after, one of the
Commissioners did advertise me, That it was your Majesties pleasure those let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
should not be sent, which I obeyed.</p>
                           <p>The eleventh of July after, I sent Comissions into ten severall Counties for
enquiries to be made of the Estates of Recusants already convicted: But present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after letters were sent to the severall Sheriffs of the said Counties, requiring
them to stay all proceedings upon the said commissions untill your Majesties plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
were further knowne, upon sight whereof the Commissioners desisted,
whereby I lost 114 li. which I had disbursed to Substitutes and Messengers to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray
the charges of executing the said Commissions. And albeit in <hi>October</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
Letters were sent to the said Sheriffs for proceedings to be had upon the
said Commissions, yet in regard of the afforesaid stay, the Service was so dispara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
and the commissioners were so discouraged, that they have since neglected
to execute the like Commissions directed unto them; and some Sheriffs have
likewise neglected to provide Juries for finding and returning Inquisitions of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusants Estates.</p>
                           <p>In February following, I acquainted Your Majesties Commissioners here with
the stay of the said Commissions,<note place="margin">This was meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to make a distinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of meaner quality.</note> and backwardnesse of the commissioners in the
County to proceed in the like service, and intreated them that therefore they
would be pleased to signe Letters once againe to the Iustices of peace, and therein
Your Majesties pleasure might be signified, as well for the Indicting and Convict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of all Recusants, as also that the Commissioners hereafter appointed should
give better attendance in executing Commissions of equity: To which purpose
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:36432:13"/>
I did then present unto them a draught of a Letter, which being read over
unto them, they desired the Lord Treasurer to shew it Your Majesty, in regard
Your Majesties pleasure was to be declared therein, upon intimation whereof by his
Lordship they would signe such Letters, the which his Lordship about two or

How dangerous a seducer this <hi>Southworth,</hi> alias <hi>Southwell</hi> was, appeares by this
Petition of <hi>Robert VVhite,</hi> Sub-Curate of St. <hi>Margarets</hi> Parish in <hi>VVestminster</hi> to
the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the last great sicknesse, 1636.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>MOst humbly sheweth, That the Petitioner ever since the beginning of this
grievous visitation in <hi>Westminster,</hi> hath used all the pains &amp; diligence that
possibly he could, to serve the Cure in the absence of Dr. <hi>VVimberley;</hi> and
bein gimployd by divers charitably disposed people to distribute their alms among
the most indigent and distressed sort of people, he hath observed TWO PO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PISH
PRIESTS to frequent <hi>VVestminster,</hi> one of which is called <hi>Southwell,</hi>
who is, and long hath been a prisoner in the <hi>Gatehouse,</hi> but<note n="*" place="margin">These Priests had liberty to goe &amp; live abroad even whiles they were pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners, the more safely to seduce the people.</note> lies about <hi>Clerkenwel,</hi>
This <hi>Southwell,</hi> under a pretence of distributing Almes, sent FROM SOME
OF THE PRIESTS IN SOMERSET-HOUSE, or OTHER
PAPISTS, doth take occasion to go into divers visited Houses in <hi>VVestmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
and namely to the house of one <hi>VVilliam Baldwin,</hi> and <hi>VVilliam Stiles</hi> in
the <hi>Kemp-yard</hi> in <hi>VVestminster,</hi> and there finding <hi>Baldwin</hi> neer the point of
death, did set upon him by all meanes to make him change his religion, whereunto
by his subtile perswasions <hi>Baldwin</hi> easily consented, and received the Sacrament from him according to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and so died a <hi>Romish-catholique.</hi> And
in the same maner he perverted <hi>William Stiles,</hi> who also died a <hi>Romish-catholique.</hi>
And <hi>South-well</hi> to colour and hide these wicked practices, <hi>doth see the Watchmen</hi>
and other poor people thereabouts, that they should affirm he comes onely to
give Almes. And thus under a pretence of relieving the bodies of poor people, he
comes onely to poysons their souls.</p>
                  <p>Now may it please your Grace, the Petitioner having no means to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
these Priests, or to stop this danger and dishonour to our Religion,
doth humbly implore your Graces favour and zeal, that some speedy course
may be taken to hinder the progresse thereof; and that not onely for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
and setling of poor people in our Religion, but also to prevent a
great danger which may ensue to the <hi>Queenes Maiestie</hi> at her coming to
<hi>Denmarke-house,</hi> for that divers poor people <hi>newly turned Romish-Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques,
do commonly frequent the Masse at Denmarke-house;</hi> And three of
those poor people watched all night with <hi>VVilliam Stiles</hi> immediately before
he died, and the next day went thither to Masse. A most wicked course if it
should not be remedied.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Upon this, <hi>Southwell</hi> soon after was apprehended, indicted, arraigned, and the
premises fully proved against him by sundry witnesses; and yet by the Queens and
<hi>VVindebanks</hi> powerfull meanes, his finall triall was put off, to the great discontent of
the people, &amp; he not long after released, even neer the verie time that D. <hi>Bastwicke,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Burton,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Prynne,</hi> were most grievously censured in the Star-chamber,
and most barbarously pillored, deprived of their eares, stigmatized, yea sent away
Close-prisoners and exiles into forraign Islands, and there shut up so strait, that not
so much as their Wives of Friends might have accesse by person or letter to them,
nor set footing in the Islands where they were cloistered up, under pain of impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment
and the severest censures; and all for opposing the Popish Doctrines and
Innovations brought into our Church by the Prelaticall and Popish Confederates,
who conspired to undermine our Religion, and boldly discovering this their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:36432:18"/>
spiracie in printed bookes, to the incredulous secure world, who never dreamed of
such an imminent danger to our religion, which is since more palpably and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally
discovered. To such an exorbitant power and prevalency had the Priests
and Popish faction then attained.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if any Priests or Jesuits were committed in the Countrey, then it was
this Secretaries ordinary practice to send for them up to <hi>London,</hi> by his own War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
and Messengers, under pretence of proceeding against them here, and so to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease
them: to give you one late instance (most Counties having made experiences
of this practice.)</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>FRancis Newton</hi> Gentleman, about thirteene yeares last past, obtained a generall
Warrant from the Lords of his Majesties Privy Councell, for the apprehending
of Jesuits, Seminary-Priests, transporters of children &amp;c.</p>
               <p>By vertue of which Warrant he the said <hi>Newton,</hi> together with his servant <hi>Iohn
Cooke,</hi> did apprehend at severall times divers Jesuits and Priests, to the number of
36. at his great charge and hazard of life; who were brought before Secretary
<hi>Cooke,</hi> and others, and by them committed to severall prisons: Whereupon the late
Secretary <hi>Windebanke</hi> discharged the said Jesuits and Priests, and committed <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
and <hi>Cooke</hi> severall times to prison for performing their service, to their great
charges and hazard of life.</p>
               <p>The said <hi>Windebanke</hi> sending for <hi>Newton,</hi> tooke from him at severall times eight
Watches (formerly taken from Priests, and given to him by the Lords,) to the value
of 70. pound.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the said <hi>Windebanke</hi> took from <hi>Newton</hi> two rich units of popish Vest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
formerly given him by the Lords of the Privy Counceil; The said <hi>Winde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banke</hi> engaging his Honour to <hi>Newton,</hi> that <hi>he should receive from the Queene</hi> 200.
pounds or the Vestments againe; <hi>Newton</hi> often demanded the same of <hi>Windebanke,</hi>
yet could never get them, nor the value of them, but onely threatning words.</p>
               <p>Divers Jesuits and Priests constantly frequently the said <hi>Windebankes</hi> house;
and amongst the rest one <hi>Henry Lloyd,</hi> alias <hi>Francis Smith,</hi> alias <hi>Francis Ryvers,</hi> alias
<hi>Francis Simons,</hi> a grand Jesuite, a great seducer, and chiefe agent in the great and
damnable <hi>plot of the Gun-powder-treason,</hi> who by the <hi>counsell of Windebanke</hi> and
some of his adherents, gave a judgement of 300. pound to be a prisoner to the Fleet,
that the State nor Messengers should take no notice of his <hi>Iesuiticall Plot.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The said <hi>Newton,</hi> together with one <hi>Thomas Mayo,</hi> about August in the tenth
yeare of the King, searching the house of one <hi>Bartholmen Frumman</hi> Esquire, of
<hi>Cheame,</hi> in the County of <hi>Surrey,</hi> found the said <hi>Lloyd,</hi> alias <hi>Ryvers</hi> the Jesuite
there; who going to carry him away, the said Jesuit shewed him and two high Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stables
the said <hi>Windebankes</hi> Warrant, that <hi>no Messenger or any other person should
molest him,</hi> whereupon they left him there.</p>
               <p>Moreover the said Jesuite then said to <hi>Newton</hi> and <hi>Mayo</hi> and the high <hi>Consta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,</hi>
these words: <hi>Are you angry with me for being here? if you will stay till to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
being Monday, you shall see seven more Priests of us here;</hi> this he spake in a vaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
way, having a protection from <hi>Windebanke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The said <hi>Newton</hi> and <hi>Mayo</hi> the Michaelmas-Terme following indicted the said
Jesuite and <hi>Frumman</hi> the harbourer in the <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> and proceeded to the Vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary:
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:36432:20"/>
whereupon <hi>Windebanke</hi> sent a Warrant and apprehended <hi>Newton</hi> and <hi>Mayo,</hi>
and threatned them, that if they did not forthwith forbeare prosecuting the said
Jesuit and harbourer, he would immediately lay them by the heels; but the said <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
and <hi>Mayo</hi> proceeded to the Vtlary against them both, notwithstanding: which
<hi>Windebanke</hi> perceiving, caused Justice, <hi>Bartlet</hi> to stay the proceedings thereupon.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Francis Smith</hi> the Jesuit said to M. <hi>Waddesworth</hi> and M. <hi>Taxley</hi> these words
(in <hi>Norfolke</hi>) some yeers since, <hi>That it is not now a time nor way to bring in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
by disputing or books of Controversie,</hi> BVT IT MVST BE DONE
BY AN ARMY, AND BY FIRE AND SWORD.<note place="margin">Nota.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The said Jesuit usually frequented the now <hi>Archbishop of Canterbury,</hi> and was
very seldome from him: which Jesuit perswading <hi>Cooke, Newtons</hi> servant, to goe
with Sir <hi>Kenelm Digby</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> that so <hi>Cooke might give no more information
against Priests;</hi> and promising him great preferments there, he did about Christmas
was foure yeers, cary <hi>Cooke</hi> one morning to Sir <hi>Kenelms</hi> bed-side at M. <hi>Burgesses</hi> in
S. <hi>Martins</hi> in the <hi>Fields,</hi> where after some discourse, <hi>Smith</hi> taking his leave of Sir
<hi>Kenelm,</hi> prayed him in <hi>Cookes</hi> hearing, <hi>to excuse him to my Lord of Canterbury, that
he could not dine that day with his Lordship;</hi> and prayed him to desire my Lord of
<hi>Canterbury,</hi> to <hi>remember the businesse that he last spake with him about.</hi> To which
Sir <hi>Kenelm</hi> replied, <hi>that he would not faile him to doe it,</hi> for he was to dine with my
Lord of <hi>Canterbury</hi> that day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iohn Gray,</hi> a Messenger, took one <hi>Fisher</hi> a grand Jesuit, who having been severall
times examined before the Lords of the Councell, the said <hi>Canterbury</hi> came from
the King, and delivered this sentence against him: viz. Mr. <hi>Fisher, fall downe upon
your knees, and pray for the King, that he is so mercifull unto you to save your life.</hi> It
is the <hi>Kings pleasure that you must be banished the Kingdome; and be committed to
the Gate-house, there to remain, untill you put in good security never to return again.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet suddenly after the said <hi>Fisher</hi> his imprisonment, <hi>Windebanke</hi> released him, and
gave him a protection, <hi>That no Messenger, nor any other person should molest him, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
paine of his displeasure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The said <hi>Gray</hi> and <hi>Cooke</hi> afterwards (not knowing of his Protection) apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<hi>Fisher;</hi> whereupon he shewed him his Protection from <hi>Windebanke,</hi> and was
thereupon discharged. Vpon which <hi>Gray</hi> and <hi>Cook</hi> went to Secretary <hi>Cook</hi> and told
him that <hi>Fisher</hi> was discharged by <hi>Windebanke.</hi> Whereupon Master Secretary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<hi>Gray</hi> to go to my L. of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and tell him of <hi>Fishers</hi> discharge. Vpon
this <hi>Gray</hi> and <hi>Cook</hi> went accordingly to speak with <hi>Canterbury,</hi> yet could not have
any admittance to him; but spake with M. <hi>Dell</hi> his Secretary, and demanded a
Warrant of him under <hi>Canterburies</hi> hand to apprehend <hi>Fisher</hi> the Jesuite: who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
and said to <hi>Gray,</hi> that <hi>he was an idle fellow to come for a Warrant from my Lord,
for he would meddle with no such matter as that was;</hi> but bid <hi>Gray,</hi> if he would have
a Warrant, <hi>he should repaire to the Councell-board;</hi> Vpon which <hi>Gray</hi> answered and
said, <hi>I see how the game goes now; is not my Lord Metropolitane of England, and
ought not he to grant me a Warrant? but I hope eye it be long to see better dayes.</hi> Vpon
this the next day following <hi>Canterbury</hi> complained of <hi>Gray,</hi> and brought him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Councell, and <hi>committed him to the Fleet,</hi> where he remained 14. weeks.
After which <hi>Canterbury</hi> seeing the Lords would discharge <hi>Gray,</hi> who oft petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
them by his wife, caused <hi>Windebank</hi> to lay his Warrant upon him; wherupon he
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:36432:21"/>
there remained prisoner 7. weeks more. And upon often petitioning by <hi>Grayes</hi> wife,
<hi>Windebanke</hi> was at last contented to discharge <hi>Gray,</hi> so that <hi>Gray</hi> would put in <hi>good
security unto him</hi> THAT HE WOULD NOT HEREAFTER AP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PREHEND
ANY MORE PRIESTS.</p>
               <p>The said <hi>Newton</hi> apprehended <hi>Henry Gifford,</hi> a dangerous Iesuit, and brought him
before Iustice <hi>Griffith,</hi> where he was tendred the Oath of <hi>Supremacy and Allegiance;</hi>
whereupon the said Iesuite replyed and said these words: <hi>I wish to God, that all those
who made the Oathes of Allegiance and Supremacie, that their tongues were seered in
their mouthes, and all those that gave consent thereto.</hi> Whereupon the said Iustice told
him, <hi>that the King, the Lords, and Commons had made these Oathes,</hi> and committed
him to prison. The next day following, the <hi>Iustice</hi> and <hi>Newton</hi> were intreated to
come to Secretary <hi>Windebank</hi> to speak with him concerning the Iesuit; Which they
doing, <hi>Windebank</hi> said to <hi>Newton, Is this a Priest or a Iesuit? Newton</hi> answered and
said, <hi>If he be not a Priest, he is worse than a Priest;</hi> and told him the aforesaid <hi>dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
words.</hi> Then said <hi>Windebanke</hi> to the Iesuit (be being brought before him by
<hi>Windebankes</hi> direction) <hi>I will not baile you for a world;</hi> and sent him to prison. But
notwithstanding, that <hi>night or the next day, he set him at liberty, without giving New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton his Fees.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Newton</hi> and <hi>Cook</hi> apprehended one <hi>Fit-Iames,</hi> an <hi>Arch-spie</hi> for <hi>Rome,</hi> and brought
him before <hi>Windebank;</hi> yet <hi>Drew Lovet</hi> an Arch-Papist wrought so with him, that
he took <hi>Lovets</hi> word for his appearance before him, and discharged <hi>Newton</hi> of him.
About foure dayes after <hi>Windebank</hi> told <hi>Newton</hi> that <hi>Iames</hi> had given him good sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
concerning him. Afterwards <hi>Iames</hi> being arrested upon a Bill of <hi>Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sex,</hi>
at the suit of one <hi>Lincoln,</hi> upon a debt of 200. l. and put into the Gatehouse, <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debanke</hi>
thereupon hearing of his arrest (and solicited by <hi>Lloyd</hi> alias <hi>Smith,</hi> the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
grand Iesuit, and <hi>Lovet</hi> the Papist) sent for <hi>Newton,</hi> and gave him a warrant
to take the plaintife <hi>Lincoln</hi> and the <hi>Bailiffe,</hi> for arresting <hi>Iames;</hi> who did apprehend
and bring them before <hi>Windebanke.</hi> He thereupon sent for the prisoner <hi>Iames</hi> to be
brought before him, who being brought, he delivered him to <hi>Newton,</hi> and said, <hi>This
is your prisoner, for the King shall be served before you,</hi> Meaning the plaintife. <hi>Newton</hi>
answered, <hi>May it please your Honour, you have discharged him from me these 6. daies
agone, and I have nothing to do with him. Windebanke</hi> replyed and said, <hi>That is all one,
you shall take him. And if the plaintif be not contented therewith, I will lay him by the
heeles.</hi> Whereupon he was delivered to <hi>Newton.</hi> But immediately upon the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifs
going away, <hi>Windebanke</hi> caused <hi>Newton</hi> to deliver him the prisoner, and then
<hi>Windebanke</hi> delivered the prisoner to <hi>Lovet,</hi> and bid him <hi>shift for himselfe.</hi> Upon
which the plaintif lost his debt, and lay in prison for the monies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moreover, the said</hi> Windebanke <hi>at sundry times threatned</hi> Cooke, <hi>that</hi> if ever he
did go with <hi>Newton</hi> or any other to shew them any Priests, he would lay <hi>Cook</hi> in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
and that he would take a course that he should never come out. <hi>And also said,</hi> that
he would have <hi>Cook</hi> whipt about the streets; and caused <hi>Cook</hi> to fall downe upon his
knees to ask forgivenesse for what he had done formerly against Iesuits and Priests,
having made a Mittinius to send him to the Gate-house, which he would not revoke,
unlesse he would make such submission.</p>

               <p>To this I shall adde two relations more. During my imprisonment in the Tower
of <hi>London,</hi> Captaine <hi>Francis Conesby</hi> Surveyer of the Ordnance, went one mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
about the yeare 1633. to the <hi>New prison</hi> to visit one <hi>William Drury</hi> a Priest
(who had formerly brought him a letter from a speciall friend in the Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
being then a prisoner there; comming into the prison and inquiring for his
Chamber, he was brought into a large Hall, with sundry partitions on one side
(like drinking roomes in an Alchouse or Tavern) and a curtain drawn before each
of them; where he saw some walking, others sitting in the Hall; who informed him
that <hi>Drury</hi> in one of those Roomes: and going in order from one of them to
the other, he found a Priest and a woman privately together at confession in every
one of them, and <hi>Drury</hi> with a very handsome Chambermaide well clad in the
uppermost of them. With whom having some conference about halfe an houre
in his Chamber, as he was returning backe through the Hall, hee found a Priest
there saying Masse, and the Iaylor himselfe with a Censor persuming the roome,
and censing the same, (at they use in Popish Masses) and so many people, men and
women, kneeling downe in the Hall, that hee could hardly passe by. At which
strange sight he was much amazed, and not long after being in my company, upon
a discourse concerning the increase of Popery, and favour shewed to Priests, hee
related this story to me with much regrect, avouching the truth thereof upon his
credit.</p>
               <p>Since the sitting of this Parliament, by the houses speciall direction there were
severall Priests arraigned and condemned at Newgate much against his Majesties
will, who notwithstanding both Houses earnest request to the contrary reprieved
them from execution; and after many messages was hardly drawne to condescend
to revoke this reprive, and yeeld them up to publike justice: which being gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
the Parliament out of their lenity spared the lives of some of them, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
still prisoners in Newgate; where they have gained so much favour and
so far corrupted the Keepers, that even since the Covenant and Protestation taken,
they have had Masses publikely in their chambers, of which information being gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and a warrant made to Master <hi>Newton</hi> to search their chambers, during the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
last Sessions but one at Newgate, who searching <hi>Peter Milfords</hi> chamber (being
the most active dangerous seducer of all the rest) found about Masse time an Altar
ready furnished in his Chamber, foure severall suites of Massing Vestments, with
sundry Crucifixes, <hi>Agnus Deies,</hi> Reliques, Masse-bookes, and other such Romish
trinkets, (all delivered to the late Lord Mayors custodie) with no lesse then
eleven persons at Masse, five of them Prisoners in the House, and the other sixe
strangers; of which grosse abuse and intollerable connivance at condemned Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
(under the very Parliaments and Courts of Sessions Noses, in these dangerous
times, even since the Covenant and Protestation taken) information was given, and
complaint made in open Court, at the Sessions in the Old Bayly, by Master <hi>Newton</hi>
in my hearing, and thereupon order given (if observed) to prevent such licentious
abuses for the future, deserving the severast censures for the present.</p>
               <p>I shall adde one most remarkeable occurrent more, done in one of the highest
Courts of publike Iustice, in the Kings owne Name, by his speciall Command, in

in the Tower, I met with some more speciall passages in Popish writers, which
much confirmed me in the reality of this Conspiracie against our Religion, and
to re-establish Popery; which because then unobvious and unknown to most, I had

the thoughts of the holy Apostolicall

And indeede the Church was but
then in her infancie, when the King of
Kings did chuse her for his inheritance,
and so affectionately, that we beleeve, the

Principalities and first places of blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in Heaven, they have obtained on
Earth the Triumphant ornaments of true
holines. And although now the State
of the English Church is altered, we see
neverthelesse the Court of Great <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi>
adorned and furnished with morall
Vertues which might serve to support
the Charity that we beare unto her, and
be an Ornament to the name of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
if withall she could have for her
defence and protection the Orthodox
and Catholike truth. Therefore by how
much the more the Glory of your most
noble Father, and the apprehension of
your Royall inclination, delights us, with
so much more zeale, we desire that the
gates of the Kingdome of Heaven might
be opened unto you, and that you might
purchase to your selfe the love of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall
Church. Moreover it being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
that <hi>Gregory</hi> the great, of most
blessed memory, hath introduced to the
English people, and taught to their Kings
the law of the Gospell, <hi>and the respect of
Apostolicall Authority:</hi> We, as inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
to him, in holinesse and vertue, but
equall in name and degree of dignity, it
is very reasonable that we following his
blessed footesteps, should indeavour the
salvation of those Provinces, especially
at this time, <hi>when your designe (Most
noble Prince) elevates us to the hope of
an extraordinary advantage:</hi> Therefore
as you have directed your journey to
<hi>Spaine,</hi> towards the Catholicke King,
with desire to allie your self to the house
of <hi>Austria,</hi> We do much commend your
designe, and indeed doe testifie openly
in this present businesse, <hi>that you are he
that takes the principall care of our
Prelacy.</hi> For seeing that you desire to
take in marriage the daughter of <hi>Spaine:</hi>
from thence we may easily conjecture
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:36432:24"/>
that the ancient seedes of Christian Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which have so happily flourished in
the hearts of the Kings of great <hi>Brittaine</hi>
may (God prospering them) revive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
in your soule. And indeed it is
not to be beleeved that the same man
should love such an alliance, that hates
the Catholique Religion, and should
take delight to oppresse the holy Chaire.
To that purpose we have commanded to
make continually most humble prayers
to the father of lights, that he would be
pleased to put you as a faire Flower of
Christendome, and the onely hope
of Great <hi>Brittain,</hi> in possession of that
most noble heritage, that your Ancestors
have purchased for you, to defend the
Authority of the Soveraign High Priest;
and to fight against the Monsters of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie.
Remember the dayes of old, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire

I have seene a Coppy of these Letters in English, long since; the Kings letter
(who perchance writ two of this nature) being some what different from the French
in some expressions, though not in substance: Now that such Letters really pasted
betweene the King and Pope, during his abode in Spaine, appeares not onely by
divers ancient Printed Copies of it in sundry Languages, but is also thus expresse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
attested by Master <hi>Iames Howell,</hi> (an attendant upon his Majestie in that expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
no friend to Parliaments, but a Malignant now in custodie, in his <hi>Vocall For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,</hi>
dedicated to the King himselfe, the Queene, and Prince, Printed at London
1640. p. 128. </p>
               <q>
                  <p>The <hi>Holy Sire</hi> (the Pope) who was so great a friend to the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
alliance (<hi>who had formerly writ unto, and sent to visite Prince</hi> Rocalino
(<hi>Charles</hi>) was taken away by the hand of Fate, &amp;c. Moreover his booke farther
informeth us p. 124. That <hi>Chenandra</hi> (Olivares) the chiefe Ingrosser of the Olives
(the King of Spaines) favours, welcomming the Prince into Spaine, said; That he
doubted not but he came thither, <hi>to be of their Religion.</hi> And p. 134. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
voyce among those of <hi>Elaiana</hi> (Spaine) was; that Prince <hi>Rocalino</hi> (Charles)
came thither <hi>to make himselfe a Christian.</hi> But that which is most observable is
this passage concerning the Articles in favour of Papists agreed on, and sworne to
by King <hi>Iames,</hi> and his Majestie, by the Popes sollicitation upon the Spanish
Treaty: p. 125. 126. 127. when <hi>Rocalino</hi> (Prince Charles) arrived,
matters were brought to that perfection by the strenuous negotiation of
<note n="*" place="margin">Lord <hi>Digby</hi> who now swayes in his Councels very much.</note> 
                     <hi>Sophronio,</hi> that there wanted nothing for the consummation of all things, but a
dispensation from <hi>Petropolis</hi> (Rome) which at last<note n="*" place="margin">And after that another from the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Pope. <hi>p.</hi> 133.</note> came: and before that time
<hi>Rocalino</hi> (Charl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s) was not admitted to speake with the Lady <hi>Amira</hi> in quality of
a sutor, but a Prince. Now the said Dispensation came clogged with an unhappy
unexpected clause, thrust in of purpose, as it appeares, to retard the proceedings
of things; which was;<note n="*" place="margin">Nota</note> 
                     <hi>That whereas there were certaine Articles condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
unto by Druina's Monarke</hi> (King Iames) <hi>in Fauour of the Petropolitans</hi>
(Papists) <hi>that were in that Kingdome, and other Crownes under his Dominion;</hi>
the great Arch-flamin (the Pope) demanded caution for the performance of them.
The <hi>Royall Oake</hi> answered, that he could give <hi>no other caution then his Word
and Oath: and Recalino</hi> (Prince Charles) <hi>should doe the like, which should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by his Councell of State and exemplified under Druinas</hi> (Englands) <hi>broad
Seale:</hi> but this would not satisfie, unlesse some<note n="*" place="margin">Popish.</note> 
                     <hi>Petropolitan</hi> Soveraigne Prince
should ingage himselfe for them. Hereupon all matters were like to goe off the
hinges, and a buzze went abroad, that <hi>Rocalino</hi> intended to get away covertly.
In these traverses <hi>Chenandra</hi> steps forth and said: there were three wayes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
this businesse, two good and one bad: the first good way was, That Prince
<hi>Rocalino</hi> (Charles) <hi>Should become a Petropolitan</hi> (Papist.) The second was,
That as <hi>Elaiana</hi> (Spaine) was obliged to him for his free comming thither, so
she might as freely deliver to him the Lady <hi>Amira,</hi> trusting him without further
condition. The ill way was, not to trust <hi>Rocalino,</hi> at all with any thing, but binde
him as fast as they could. Whiles matters were thus a canvasing, and gathering ill
blood; <hi>Elaianas</hi> (Spaines) King stepped up, and proffered to engage himselfe by
Oath, for the satisfaction of the great <hi>Arch flamine,</hi> but with this proviso, that
he must first consult with his Ghostly Fathers, whether he might doe it <hi>Salua Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientia</hi>
or no. Hereupon the businesse was referred to a Committe of the learnedst
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:36432:26"/>
Yewes, (Bishops, Divines) and the State of the Question was.</p>
                  <p>Whether the<note n="*" place="margin">King of <hi>Spaine.</hi>
                     </note>

                  <p>This Assembly long demurr'd and dwelt upon the Question, and after a long

                  </p>
                  <p>This difficulty being surmounted, there was exceeding great joy, and all the
Capitulations were <hi>interchangeably sworne unto, Both by the Oake and Olive:</hi>
and as <hi>Chenandra</hi> said in <hi>Elaiana;</hi> so the<note n="*" place="margin">King <hi>Iames.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Royall Oake</hi> himselfe was so confident
that he said; All the Devills in hell could not now breake the match: whereto a
blunt facetious Knight being by, answered; That there was never a Devill now
left in hell, for they were all gone to <hi>Spaine</hi> to helpe make up the match.</p>

               <p>By all these observable passages, dedicated so lately to the King himselfe, by one
of his owne servants, who was privie to them; it is apparent, that not onely Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
passed betweene the King and Pope whilst he continued in <hi>Spaine:</hi> but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
That<note n="*" place="margin">This Prince <hi>Charles</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in the <hi>English</hi> Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie of the Letter to the Pope, though but implied in the <hi>French.</hi>

Dominions, even such as the Pope himselfe approved, were at the Popes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
condescended unto by King <hi>Iames,</hi> and caution offered and given to the
Pope for the performance of them, even by King <hi>Iames,</hi> King <hi>Charles,</hi> and the
King of <hi>Spaines</hi> regall words, Seales, Oathes: That these Articles were to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by the Privie Councell of State, and exemplied under the Great Seale of
<hi>England,</hi> 
                  <q>And that the maine end the Pope and Papists aymed at in this <hi>Spanish</hi>
match, was the seducing of the King and Realme to the Romish Religion, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
of them to their ancient Vassallage to the Sea of <hi>Rome:</hi> which will bee
more apparent if we adde to this, that <hi>Hugh Simple,</hi> a Scottish <hi>Iesuite,</hi> being in

to the King and Councell of <hi>Spaine,</hi> that they should not conclude
any match with <hi>England,</hi> unlesse there should be erected in each Vniversity under

caused the Image of the Crosse to be redressed, and that men should not foule it

were the true,</hi> yet then to avoyd all sorts of rumors, which might then have risen
to the prejudice of peace in the Re-publicke: I said, that in this Religion were
many superfluous ceremonies, the which deserved to be refused.</p>
                  <p>At the same time many Roman Catholikes, our Subjects and members of our
Realme, presented us their requests, by which they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>arnestly beseeched us to grant
them the liberty of their Conscience, upon the hopes they had to be so much the
more comforted under our raigne, as they had beene <hi>Dppressed</hi> under the raigne
of Queene <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> But as it oft times happens, that those who ardently desire
any thing, imagine with themselves, that it is very easie to doe, or to be obtained,
and oftentimes prove the contrary: so all the Catholikes who hoped to be relee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by us, and to be disingaged of great <hi>and intollerable surcharges which haue
beene imposed upon their Goods, Bodies and Soules,</hi> during the reigne of the said
<hi>Elizabeth,</hi> requiring onely of our Royall benevolence to be remitted to the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their Goods, Honours, and Estates, and to be maintained in the Religion
in which all our Predecessours and Kings of <hi>Scotland</hi> have lived from <hi>Donaldus,</hi>
untill the time of our late beloved Mother, who received <hi>Martyrdome</hi> in this

have sealed it with their owne blood in their death,) were then deceived of
their hopes, by an apparent feare of certaine commotions which then might have
ensued. So that in all our Realmes, for the sole respect of my person, <hi>and not by
Reason of Religion it selfe,</hi> (so as many of the said Catholikes have very well
knowne) there was no mutation or change at all had; although they well k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Loe here (writes this <hi>Mercury</hi>) the causes which moved his Majestie of Great
<hi>Britaine</hi> to seeke after the alliance of <hi>Spaine</hi> by marriages, the which many in
<hi>England,</hi> and <hi>especially the Puritans or reformed,</hi> and those of the <hi>English</hi> confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
adhearing to this Sect, were no wayes well pleased with; and cheifely, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
understood, of the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> his honourable entertainement at <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drit,</hi>
and of the Articles of the Marriage; which were <hi>to be cxamined at
Rome.</hi> So the <hi>French Mercury,</hi> which thus proceedes.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon two writings ran from hand to hand; the one intituled; <hi>A Discourse of
the Archbishop of Canterbury</hi> (Abbot) <hi>to the King of Great Brittaine,</hi> and the other
<hi>Vox Popul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>:</hi> the latter produceth many excellent reasons in point of policie and
Religion against the Popish match with <hi>Spaine</hi> (which you may peruse in the book
it selfe, being Common.) The first condemnes his Majesties toleration of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Religion in his Realmes, as being displeasing to God, an anguish and griefe to
his best Subjects professing the true reformed religion; a great dishonour to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
who had publickely Writ and disputed often against that Religion, which he
knew in his owne conscience to be false and superstitious. That his Edicts and
Proclamations for the tolleration of it, could not be confirmed without a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(which would never condescend thereunto) unlesse he would openly shew
to his Subjects, that he intended to usurpe an absolute liberty, to infringe and null all
Lawes of the Country: That it would produce many dangerous consequences,
and bring the just Iudgements of God both upon the whole Realme in generall,
and himselfe in particular. With all, it censures the ill advise of those who sent the
Prince into <hi>Spaine</hi> without the generall consent of the Realme, which by law had
more interest in him, then the King his Father &amp;c. (as you may reade in <hi>Mercury.</hi>)</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="48" facs="tcp:36432:29"/>
Notwithstanding all these and<note n="*" place="margin">Dr. <hi>Hackwel</hi> and others writ against this Popish match which divers Bishops approved of as lawfull.</note> other contrary advises, this match went on so
farre, that the generall Articles of the match, with the Popes alterations, were so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnely
sealed and sworne to by the Prince in <hi>Spaine,</hi> and also by King <hi>Iames</hi> in
the Chappell of <hi>Whitehall Iuly</hi> 20. 1624. the solemnity whereof you may reade
at large in the<note n="*" place="margin">Page 517. &amp;c. <hi>An.</hi> 1623. &amp; p. 19. to 30 <hi>An.</hi> 1624.</note> 
                     <hi>French Mercury,</hi> together with the articles. At the taking of this
Oath in the Chappell, there arose these two difficulties: The first about this Title
of the POPE, <hi>MOST HOLY,</hi> which King <hi>Iames</hi> refused to give to the Pope,
in the Oath which he ought to pronounce in the Chappell, alleaging the repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancie
thereof to his Religion, and that this would be a reproach, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
prejudiciall to him for the future. But the <hi>Spanish</hi> Embassadors refused to
passe it over, if his Majestie would not consent to give him the foresaid Title; to
which in the end he consented. The second difficulty was, that some reported to
the Embassadors, that they should have such prayers in the Kings Chappell when
they came to see the Articles sealed and sworn to by the King, and such singing of
Psalmes as were used in the Protestant Church and Kings Chappell, at which pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
they could not be present since they came thither to no other end <hi>but to assure
maintaine, and Warrant the Catholike Apostolicall and Roman Church.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the King commanded that nothing should be there sung, but what was sung
when the Constable of <hi>Castile</hi> tooke his oath there,<note place="margin">Nota.</note> to sweare the peace between
the two Crownes, which was an hymne of joy, in praise of peace: and to out
all scruple, the King caused the Register of his Chappell to carry the Hymne to the
Embassadors to peruse, and so all difficulties were removed: the King yeelding to
the Popish Ambassadors, to gratifie the Pope in his Anti-christian Title; but they
not yeelding one haires breadth to him, in honour or approbation of our Prayers,
Psalmes, or Religion, which must give place to their Catholicke pleasures.</p>
                  <p>The Articles being solemnely sworn in the forenoone; the King made an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
feast to the Embassadors; which ended, the King and they went to the
Councell-chamber, where all the Lords of the Councell sealed and subscribed
the Generall articles of the marriage. Which done the Embassadors came to the
King, who took this solemne Oath, and swore these private articles to them, in
favour of Papists and advancement of the Romish Religion: (enough to amaze
all Protestant Readers) which I have faithfully translated out of the Latine Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py

               <p>Before I proceed further, I shall desire thee, kinde Reader, whosoever thou art, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if an English, Scotish, or Irish Protestant, to pause a while, and mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> seriously
to ponder these premised Passages, Articles, Oaths, worthy thy most serious consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
if not thy admiration; and when thou hast so done, then let me propound
these few Queres to thee from them, &amp; to the Honourable House of Parliament too.</p>
               <p>First, Whether the <hi>heart of Kings</hi> (as well as of other persons) <hi>be not unsearchable;</hi>
yea, <hi>deceitfull above all things, and desperately wicked;</hi> So as <hi>no man can truly know</hi>
or discerne it? as <hi>Prov. 23. 3. Ier.</hi> 17. 9. resolve past all dispute.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Whether <hi>King Iames</hi> were really so <hi>zealous a Protestant,</hi> and <hi>Anti-Papist,</hi>
as the ignorant world reputed him, especially in his declining age?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Whether those who have willingly without any compulsion, and (for ought
appeares) cordially entred into such Romish Alliances, Articles, Covenants, Oaths,
can be ever sincerely affected to the Protestant Party or Religion, or really opposite
to Popery or Papists, notwithstanding all outward Protestations, Proclamations or
flourishes to the contrary, to blinde the over credulous vulgar; ignorant of the
Premises?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Whether his <hi>Majesty</hi> having thus twice taken two solemn Oathes at
least, upon both his Treaties of Marriage with <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> (of which more
anon) to protect and maintaine to the utmost throughout his Dominions, the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Catholikes, Church and Religion yea, to suspend and abrogate all Lawes against
them; and that before ever he made any Promise, or Declaration at all to maintain the
Protestant Religion; whether he be not thereby now farre more deeply engaged by
vertue of these Oathes and Articles to protect, favour, and defend the Romish Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Faith, then the Protestant; and his Romish Catholike Subjects in all his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,
then his Protestant Lieges, having never entred into any such Solemn Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
Oathes and Covenants (unlesse lately in <hi>Scotland</hi> much against his will, with
which his Holinesse of <hi>Rome</hi> will easily dispence, being quite contrary to his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Articles) to defend and propagate the Protestants, and Protestant Religion,
as he hath done to defend Popery and his Popish Subjects?</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Whether all the premised Letters of Grace, Protection, Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences
to <hi>Priests,</hi> Iesuites, and Popish Recusants, be not the reall results and
effects of these Oathes and Articles, and of the ensuing Articles and match with
<hi>France?</hi> as the <hi>French Mercury, Tom. 9. An. 1624. p.</hi> 28. 29. expresly resolves.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Whether the true and reall designe of the Pope, the Realmes of <hi>Spain</hi> and
<hi>France,</hi> and all Promoters of these matches, Articles, were not to re-establish Popery
in its perfection, and extirpate the Protestant Religion throughout all his Majesties
Realmes, by meanes and vertue of them, by degrees?</p>
               <p>Seventhly, Whether his Majesty doth not hold himselfe now bound in conscience
by vertue of these Oathes and Articles, (what ever his outward protestations and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
be) to side with his Roman Catholike Subjects, both in <hi>England, Ireland,
Scotland,</hi> and Arm them against his Protestant Subjects and Parliaments in all three
Kingdomes, of purpose to make good these his Oathes and Articles; and to protect
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:36432:30"/>
them against the due execution of all antient Lawes already enacted, and all other
new Lawes and prosecutions now really intended against them in <hi>England, Scotland,</hi>
contrary to these his Oathes and Articles? And whether this be not the very true, and
proper cause of all his former and present Wars, Proclamations, Declarations, Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strances
against the <hi>Scots,</hi> the former, the present Parliament; yea, the very ground
why he proclaimes them Traytors, Rebels, no Parliamment, but a faction? &amp;c. Why
he brake up all the former Parliaments since his raign by discontinuances, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to dissolve and cut off this by the sword of Papists and Atheists, against the
very Act of Parliament so lately assented to by himselfe? And whether upon this
ground, he would not rather his Parliament, his Protestant Subjects, Kingdomes
should now perish, then his Catholikes Subjects, or their Religion suffer or miscarry,
as he descernes they are like to doe if the Parliament should prevaile of continue?</p>
               <p>Eightly, Whether these Oathes and Articles bee not the reall ground of the late
horrid Irish conspiracy, massacre, Rebellion, Pacification. Toleration, and his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
connivance at, if not approbation of these horrid bloody execrable practises?
of the extraordinary favours lately indulged to those cursed barbarous Rebels by
his Majesty, and his most gracious entertainement of them, not only into his
Royall favour, but Court, Army, and Realme of <hi>England,</hi> as his securest Life-Guard?</p>
               <p>Ninthly, whether it be not then high time for the Parliament, and all the Protestants
throughout his Dominions to look about them, and enter into solemn Protestations,
Covenants, Engagements, mutually to defend themselves, their Religion, Lawes,
Liberties, Lives, Estates, when they are thus endangered by the Popish party, and the
King himselfe (to omit the Queen) by Oath and Articles, is thus confederated with,
and engaged to protect them, and their Religion to the uttermost?</p>
               <p>Tenthly, Whether these Oathes and Articles considered, it can possibly bee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
that his Majesty ever took up Armes and joyned with Papists to maintain the
Protestant Religion? Or that if his Majesty by force of Armes should prevaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Parliament or Protestant party, there be, or can bee any probability or
possibility (in humane reason) left us to believe or conceive, that the Protestant Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
should ever freely enjoy the Profession of their reformed Religion, just Rights,
Lawes, Liberties, Estates, or Lives; or Papists be prohibited the free publike tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and open practice of their Antichristian-Religion? And whether then it will not
inevitably follow by vertue of these Oaths and Articles, that all Lawes whatsoever
now in force against the Pope, Popery, Papists, shall and must be presently repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
even by a packed or forced Parliament; and a publike toleration at least of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
(if not totall suppression of the Protestant Religion) settled by Parliament; and
all attempts to draw the Queen, or any else from Popery, be prohibited by Oath to all
Protestants, under paine of High Treason, without any restraint at all on Papists,
not to endeavour to seduce the King and all his Subjects, by all the wayes and arts
that may be? This being the very purport of the premised Letter, the Spanish Oath,
Articles, and of the French, here following.</p>
               <p>If any after the perusall of all these Letters, Articles, Oathes, Queres, will still be
wilfully blinde or secure, let them be so at their own utmost perill; and if they suffer,
perish through their folly, let them thank themselves: I have freed my own soule,
though theirs miscarry through their own sottishnesse or incredulity.</p>

with <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and his enter-marriage with the <hi>Queen,</hi> (a most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous
Promoter of the Roman Catholike Religion;) these severall effects
ensued.</p>
               <p>First, an extraordinary great multitude of most dangerous seducing Seminary
Priests, Iesuits, Monks of all sorts, especially Benedictines. Nunnes and Iesuitesses came
flocking over into England, and other his Majesties Dominions, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint
or inhibition whatsoever, there being no lesse then 261 Romish Priests,
Monks, Iesuites, (besides Popish Physitians, Apothecaries, and Chirurgions) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly residing in and about <hi>London,</hi> in the yeare 1624. the Catalogue of whose
names you may read in <hi>Iohn Gee,</hi> (a reclaimed English Priest, by the fall of the
Massing-Chamber in Black-Fryers, where he hardly escaped) in his <hi>I oot out of

well-nigh 300 to his knowledge in one single County alone; and above
60 English <hi>Benedictine</hi> Monks from <hi>Doway,</hi> besides those sent from other
places.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There were many new Colledges, Monasteries, and Seminaries
erected in <hi>Spaine,</hi> and other forraign Parts for the training up of English, Irish, and
Scottish Priests, Monks, Iesuites. Nunnes, to be sent over into his Majesties Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,

and new Chappels built for <hi>Masse,</hi> and a Cell for <hi>Capuchins</hi> here.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, There were many private Societies and Monasteries of Iesuites, Monks,
Nunnes, secretly erected and maintained in <hi>England,</hi> but many more openly built,
stocked, and professedly supported in <hi>Ireland,</hi> as appeares by the Remonstrance and

created by the <hi>Pope,</hi> both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> to exercise all <hi>Episcopall Iurisdiction</hi>

               <p>Fifthly, All Lawes and Proceedings against Popish <hi>Priests and Iesuits,</hi> were sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
by generall and speciall letters, warrants of Grace and Protection fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned;
and before the Kings marriage by letters sent to all parts by <hi>Bishop

imprisoned for their Religion were<note n="*" place="margin">See Mercure Francois, Tom. 9. An. 1624. p 28 to 31.</note> released, upon pretence of procu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Who soone after were generally persecuted every where in <hi>Germany, France,</hi> and all
their Townes, Forts, demolished in <hi>France</hi> by force of Armes; yea, many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
of them massacred; and <hi>Rochel</hi> it selfe betrayed into their power, by our
English ships, and the treachery of the Popish and Court party here.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, There was a speciall Society erected, not onely in <hi>Rome,</hi> but likewise
here in <hi>England,</hi> intitled, <hi>The Congregation of Propagating the Faith,</hi> consisting of
foure Orders of most desperate active <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Scotish Iesuites,</hi> residing in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;</hi>
of which Society, <hi>The Pope himselfe was the head,</hi> and <hi>Cardinall Barbarino</hi>
his chiefe substitute. And for the better advancement of this <hi>Romish design,</hi> to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the Protestant Religion, and set up Popery in all the Kings Dominions; there
was an Agent sent from the King and Queen to lie Leager at <hi>Rome</hi> (one <hi>Hamilton</hi> a
<hi>Scottish Papist</hi>) and a speciall <hi>Nuncio</hi> sent over into <hi>England</hi> from the <hi>Pope,</hi> to wit,
one <hi>Seigneour Georgio Con,</hi> a Scot, who kept his Residence here in <hi>London,</hi> and was
President of this new erected <hi>Congregation of Iesuites;</hi> which held a constant
Councell once or twice each week, had weekly dispatches to and from <hi>Rome,</hi> yea, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall

and <hi>The Popes Briefe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seventhly, All Informers against <hi>Priests, Iesuites, Papists,</hi> were discountenanced,
menaced, and many of them imprisoned, by <hi>Secretary Windebanke</hi> their Pentioner,
who not only released sundry Priests and Iesuites by his Warrants, (as you heard

and Visitation Courts: the Printing Presses were also shut up against all Books in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation

Popish Doctrines, Superstitions openly maintained, preached in Our Vniversities,

               <p>Eightly, In pursuance of this design, his Majesties greatest Favourites, and those
in highest authority under him, were all either actuall Papists in profession, or well
inclined to Popery in affection, &amp; altogether swayed by popish Councels: witnesse the
first <hi>Grand Favòurite,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> who laid the foundation of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
and French Marriage-Treaties, Articles, and was a chiefe Actor in both;
swayed wholly by his Iesuited Mother, and Dutchesse, professed Papists, and their
Cabinet counsell of Iesuites; by whose Treachery <hi>Rochel</hi> was lost. The great
Lord Treasurer <hi>Weston</hi> steared by his Popish <hi>Countesse, kindred,</hi> Sir <hi>Toby Mathews,</hi>
Sir <hi>Basil Brook,</hi> and other Papists, whiles he lived, and reconciled to the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> receiving extreame Unction and <hi>Absolution</hi> from the <hi>Popish</hi> priests and

                  </note> Doctors have most blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously
written of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> in relation to <hi>God and Christ, That all things are
subject to the command of Mary, even God himselfe: That she is the Empresse and
Queen of Heaven, and of greatest Authority in the Kingdome of Heaven, where shee
may not only impetrate but command what soever shee pleaseth; That shee sitteth as
Chauncellour in the Court of Heaven, and giveth Letters of Grace and Mercy to whom
she pleaseth: That shee is the Fountaine, Treasurer and Dispencer of all Gods Graces,
Favours; the very neck and conduit-pipe through which they are all conveyed: That God
hath freely bestowed on her the better halfe of his Kingdome, to wit, all his mercy,
reserving only his Iustice to himselfe, yet so subject to her restaints: That if any</hi> (Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Catholike) <hi>doth finde himselfe aggrieved in the Court of Gods (or the Kings) Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
(for being prosecuted for his Recusancy or seducing the Kings people) he may safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appeale to Maries Court of mercy for reliefe, shee being the Throne of Grace,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:36432:33"/>
of which the Apostle speakes,</hi> Hebr. 4. 16. <hi>Let us go boldly unto the Throne of Grace,
that wee (Catholikes) may receive (from her) grace to helpe us in time of
need:</hi> And to further this Catholike work more effectually, the Queen Mother must
be sent over into <hi>England,</hi> to contribute her assistance to the Catholike party here,
which she had so much assisted in <hi>France,</hi> and forraign parts. No wonder then if
the designe succeeded, prevailed so much of late, since assisted, promoted by so many
powerfull active agents.</p>
               <p>9. By vertue of the former Articles and Oaths, all the Parliaments during his
Majesties raigne till now, urging the execution of old Lawes against <hi>Recusants,
Priests, Iesuites,</hi> and endeavouring to make new stricter acts against them, have
(contrary to the practice of all former ages,) been broken up and dissolved in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content;
And to crosse their execution of <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Iesuites</hi> in a politicke Pleasing
covert way, divers Proclamations have been published every Parliament, to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
them the Realm by a set day; after which, if they departed not, they should
be executed, which the common people, and plaine honest-minded Parliament
men conceived, to be done out of rigour and justice against them, and so rested sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
with these Proclamations onely, which in truth, were meere policies to free
the imprisoned Priests and Iesuites out of prison, under pretext of sending them
away, and to stay all proceedings against them, whilst the Parliaments sate, by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
them so many weeks respite to depart the Realme, before which the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
commonly were dissolved: and so by this policie were secured, inlarged to do
more mischief, and either departed not all, or returned presently againe into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
as soon as the Parliaments ended, as the premisses and experience manifest.</p>
               <p>10. By meanes of these Articles, proceedings of the Papists, Priest, and Iesuites
have grown so stupendiously powerfull, as during the late <hi>Scottish</hi> troubles, to hold
a Parliament, and generall Councell of State among themselves, even in <hi>London,</hi>
wherein not the King, but the Popes own <hi>Nuntio</hi> sate President: in which Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
the chief Papists out of all parts of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales</hi> assembled, and
made severall Lawes and Ordinances for imposing taxes, and raising monies upon
all Roman Catholiques, for maintenance of the <hi>Scottish</hi> wars, which were seconded
with the Queens own Letters and Instructions to the <hi>Catholikes,</hi> reciting, <hi>VVhat great liberties and favours her Highnesse had procured for them from his Majesty; and
exciting them to a most liberall contribution toward these wars, because the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining thereof, concerned them not onely as they were Subjects,</hi> BUT AS THEY
WERE ROMAN CATHOLIKES TOO. The verity of which
Popish Parliament, orders, instructions, taxes, was fully proved and manifested be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a speciall Committee of the Commons House specially appointed for <hi>Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sants,
and their Popish Nuncio, Novemb.</hi> 9. 1640. and at other dayes of meeting
in that and the following moneths, both by the orders, letters and instructions
themselves, and the examinations of Sir <hi>Kenelm Digby,</hi> and many other Popish
Knights, chief actors in that Parliament, now remaining in the safe custody of
Master <hi>Raynolds</hi> then Chaire-man. And were not the Papists then, think you,
growne to an extraordinary exorbitant power, and the Pope revested in his long
exploded usurped supremacie in our Realme; when they should thus be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to hold and keepe a Parliament without interruption, when the Protestants
and Kingdome might hold none at all, or at least one presently dissolved in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:36432:34"/>
and the Popes owne <hi>Nuncio</hi> sit Lord President to rule the rost, when they
should be thus openly tolerated to hold a Parliament, both to make and maintaine
a warre against the religious Protestant Subjects, even with the Kings owne actuall
consent, as is cleare by his forementioned answer under his owne hand to Master
<hi>Pulfords</hi> Petition, where he not onely takes notice of these contributions granted
him by the Papists, but makes them the ground of his stay of all proceedings against
them upon penall Lawes? And that these <hi>Scottish</hi> wars were then raised by them,
to get the king into their power, and extirpate the Protestant Religion, is evident,
not only by the plot detected in <hi>Romes Master-piece,</hi> found in the Archbishops
chamber, and the observations on it, but likewise by a little <hi>English Booke</hi> then
published in print by the Iesuits, intituled, <hi>The Iubilee of the Iesuites,</hi> one copie
whereof, <hi>Thomas Chaude</hi> receiving from a woman-papist in <hi>Redriffe,</hi> delivered it
to Sheriffe <hi>Warner,</hi> which he attested in the House of Commons, <hi>Novemb.</hi> 14.
1640. as the journall records: in which booke there was this observable
Passage:<note place="margin">Nota,</note> 
                  <hi>That the Papists should fish in troubled waters, whilest the King was
ingaged in the wars with the</hi> Scots; with some prayers for their good successe; and
for THE HOLY MARTYRS THAT SUFFERED IN THE
FLEET SENT AGAINST THE HERETIKES OF ENG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND
1639. By which among other circumstances, it is evident, that not
onely the <hi>Scottish</hi> war was plotted, maintained by the Papists, but that the <hi>Spanish</hi>
fleet then happily incountered and vanquished by the <hi>Hollanders</hi> on our coasts, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
these troubles, was directly designed against the Protestants in <hi>England,</hi> by
the Popish party here, with whom they were to joyne, to cut both the <hi>English</hi> and
<hi>Scottish</hi> Protestants throats, when all the powder of the Realme, and the traine
bands armes in most Counties were ingrossed into his Majesties hands, and they
thus incountering one the other; which plot, the unexpected pacification, with
the <hi>Scots,</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> fleet most happily prevented. And in truth, the improbabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of any other likely designe; our harbour and succour of them from the <hi>Dutch</hi>
Fleet in the <hi>Downes,</hi> our supplying of them with men, victualls, ammunition, our
guarding them with our ships against the <hi>Hollanders</hi> more then was meet, our hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the <hi>Hollanders</hi> to burne their ships, which ran upon our shore, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of an <hi>English man</hi> in that Fleet upon his death-bed, out of remoise of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, (when he was brought on shore wounded in the first encounter with the
<hi>Hollanders</hi>) that this Fleet was designed for <hi>England;</hi> the speeches of some Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,
that they expected this Navie here about that time; the landing of many
hundred <hi>Spanish</hi> souldiers at <hi>Plimmouth</hi> in English Ships, but a weeke or two be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this Fleet arrived on our coasts, upon pretence to transport them thence by
land towards <hi>Flaunders,</hi> (designed, as some then feared, to surprise <hi>Plimmouth;</hi>)
the Lord <hi>Portlands</hi> sudden journey to the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi> whereof he was Governour,
with the Lord <hi>Went worth,</hi> Col. <hi>Goring,</hi> and others, where they shot away all the

                  </gap>ick manner, just when the <hi>Spanish</hi> Fleet was before that Isle, to the
end they might the easier surprise it, when they had no powder to resist them, (as
some wise men then conject<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>red,) are more then probable arguments, that this
Fleet was destinated for <hi>England,</hi> to extirpate the Protestant party; and that by
the desperate confederacy of the predominant Popish faction, and their great Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:36432:34"/>
here, who procured them so much favour and protection from us against the
<hi>Hollanders,</hi> and would never permit this mysterie of iniquity to be throughly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined.
No wonder therefore, if we see the <hi>Popish Rebels</hi> brought over into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
to murther <hi>Protestants</hi> now, since the <hi>Spanyards</hi> were thus designed, (as is
more then probable) for that purpose then: And whether we may not feare the like
designe from <hi>France,</hi> I leave to the grand Councell of the Kingdome to consider.</p>
               <p>11. Those <hi>Articles,</hi> I doubt, have beene the true cause of the late rebellion
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the massacres there; of all his Majesties favours to these rebels, of
the late pacification Articles granted to them; of his Majesties departing from,
taking up armes, arming all <hi>English</hi> Papists, and sending for Popish <hi>Irish</hi> rebels into
<hi>England,</hi> to fight against the Parliament, and of his siding with, relying on the
Popish party, to whom he is obliged to adhere, and so ingaged against the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
for feare they should execute all old, and make new. Lawes against <hi>Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sants,</hi>
contrary to his premised Oaths, and Articles.</p>
               <p>12. Wee may hence assure our selves, that wee can never have any reall pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cification
with the King and his Popish party, without a toleration of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and a suspention, or repeale of all Lawes against them, according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
Articles; and in case his Majestie should prevaile against the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
we must expect an absolute establishing of Popery, and suppression both
of the Protestant party and Religion. Yea, seeing <hi>His Maiestie is both by</hi> Oath
<hi>and</hi> Articles, <hi>not to endeavour by any means at all, to withdraw the Queen from
the profession of the Romish Religion;</hi> whereas she on the other side, is left free,
by all meanes and arts that may be, to withdraw the King from the Protestant
Religion to her owne, and his children too: Wee have great cause to feare
(if <hi>Adams, Solomons,</hi> or <hi>Ahabs</hi> seducements by their wives be duly pondered)
that his Majesty, (now wholly alienated from his Parliament, and best Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Subjects, by the Queen and popish Counsellors, and resigning himselfe up
to the Councels, Armies, Forces, Guard of his <hi>Roman Catholike Subiects,</hi> who
have the custody both of his person, and next heires apparant to his Crownes,)
may ere long be seduced to their Religion, as well as to their party; especially,
since he hath been informed, That they have a poysoned Fig reserved for him, in
case he should refuse it; as is more amply manifested in <hi>Romes Master-piece.</hi>

written by <hi>Herman Lomelius,</hi> was answered by <hi>Le Maistre;</hi> and withall, <hi>they raised
up such a faction and persecution against this their new Bishop of</hi> Calcedon <hi>in</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
<hi>and</hi> Ireland <hi>among the Popish party, that they chased and banished him out of</hi>
England <hi>into</hi> France, <hi>where he was entertained by Cardinall</hi> Richelleiu. Upon this
occasion <hi>Le Maistre</hi> thus writes in his <hi>Defence,</hi> and prints the insuing Letter of
<hi>Rudesindus Barlo,</hi> President of the <hi>Benedictine</hi> English <hi>Monkes,</hi> in these very
termes:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nunc verò Episcopum, &amp;c.</hi> But now they see the Bishop of <hi>Calcedon,</hi> shining
on every side round about, with the splendor of Vertue, by whose amiable light
and prudence, if the tempest should become more hard, it might have been as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaged
and calmed; I say, the Bishop of <hi>Calcedon,</hi> greatly desired by the people,
coming FROM THE POPE, most humanely entertained by Christians,
not grievous to the enemies of our Faith, some enflamed with private hatreds and
grudges, have expelled, have suborned secret accusers and Sycophants, as if them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
would urge and imitate an OVER MUCH REMITTED PER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SECUTION,
who cease not to complain of the grievousnesse of persecution.
You (will you that I should speake) have made, you have raised a persecution;
neither hath Religion ever suffered under a more grievous evill, then by impiety,
cloaked under the colours of a religious <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

provoke your gall against so great a man, unlesse you purposed to execrate honesty,
sanctity, modesty, courtesie, wisdome, with the most filthy kindes of enmities?
Unlesse, like the <hi>Syberites,</hi> you scatter reproaches against the Sunne, and indure
not the light of so great innocence, which no man ever ought to shun, but he who
would not imitate it?</p>
                  <p>Now all <hi>France</hi> is overslowed with greatest indignation against your madnesse,
from which, since so many mischiefes have proceeded, this one commodity accrues
to behold and imbrace so great a man; so illustrious a Champion of the Gospell,
so acceptable and lovely to our most eminent Duke and Cardinall; But in the
meane time, the filthy patrocination of certaine Writers, may cease to draw clouds
over your wickednesse: Did not Bishops heretofore carry divine books with them
wheresoever they went, even whiles the persecution was vigorous, &amp;c? Did they
not, when driven into caves, hold assemblies, reforme Priests, performe holy duties,
dispence sacred mysteries? What then forbids the same things, and others which
are not of greater pompe to be performed in <hi>England;</hi> especially, WHERE

as if the Secular Priests only should constitute the Clergie; but the Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
should by no means belong to the Body of the Clergie; yet wee <hi>Benedictines</hi>
were alwayes of a far other opinion, esteeming even our selves to be some part of
the Clergie, although not a ruling part, yet an assisting part, out of the most an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient priviledges of the Sea Apostolike; wee doe not therefore a thing diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent

ENGLISH CLERGIE, since we judge the same in part to extend unto
our selves: verily we should not deserve to be under Christ the head of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,
if we should not suffer together with the Body, especially with the Body of the
ENGLISH CLERGIE, of which we remember the greatest-part by far in

authority among them, but as those who judge, that even our tranquility doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:36432:36"/>
on their quietnesse. For we most truely judge, that it is the onely method of
Peace and concord, that to every Order may be attributed what is its owne, that
due honour and authority may be rendred to the Clergy, and their Priviledges may
be preserved inviolable to the Regulars. Hence is it, that under the best and most
prudent old man of pious memory, Doctor <hi>William Bishop,</hi> THE MOST
REVEREND ORDINARY OF ENGLAND, and Bishop of
<hi>Calcedon,</hi> the pious foundations of an wholsome concord were laid betweene the

we <hi>Benedictines</hi> agreeing, (the Venerable Bishop himselfe exhorting and proposing)
<hi>upon certaine necessary Articles of Ecclesiasticall Discipline;</hi> whence without doubt
it would have come to passe, that the other Regulars following our example,
would have consented to the same Articles, and a most joyfull face of mutuall
peace and love in the whole Clergy of <hi>England</hi> would have shined forth; but by
the death of the holy Bishop intervening, (to him verily mature by reason of his
long age, but to us very unseasonable, by reason of the beginnings of peace not yet
confirmed) these our endeavours lye in a manner intercepted, and by meanes of
the long delay of granting a successor Bishop, almost quite dead.</p>
                     <p>For wee have received (not without great dolor of minde) from two chiefe
men, Master <hi>Matthew Kellison,</hi> and Master <hi>Richard Smith,</hi> ancient Priests, and
old Doctors of Divinity, who among others were nominated to our <hi>most Holy
Lord,</hi> to undergoe the <hi>Episcopall charge,</hi> that many things are objected by some,
onely out of a shew of the zeale of God, but in truth out of a hope of retarding that
businesse, <hi>then which there is none more necessary for the advancement of Religion, and
Piety in England,</hi> Wherefore I deemed it appertained to the office of fraternall

testifie, that they, both by us, and ALMOST BY ALL THE CATHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIKES
IN ENGLAND are had in so great veneration; whether wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
their integrity of life, or excellency of learning, that we suppose there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
easily be found their Peeres, much lesse their superiours in all the Clergy of
England, whether Regular, or secular. And truely the glory of both their lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
is sufficiently knowne to the Catholike world, by the most learned Bookes,
set forth by both of them against Hereticks, in <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>English,</hi> but to us it is more
specially knowne, who have knowne both of them to have a long time governed
the Chaire with great praise of learning, as well in <hi>Phylosophy</hi> as in <hi>Theology;</hi> and
we know that Dr. <hi>Kellion</hi> was chiefe Professor of Divinity for many yeares in
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:36432:36"/>
the Vniversity of <hi>Rhemes,</hi> and that Doctor <hi>Richard Smith</hi> was first conjoyned in
the society of Studies, to the most learned Bishop of <hi>Lussion,</hi> now Cardinall of
<hi>Richelieu.</hi> And concerning the integrity of both their lives, we can say, (seeing
both of them are familiar to us and our Brethren by their almost daily conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,)
that we never yet knew any thing in their manners, which might not beseeme
grave Bishops, yea that we have alwaies found so great gravity, meekenesse and
devotion in them, as that wee may deservedly rejoyce; we have been conjoyned
to them in a most firme amity for many yeares. And this our testimony concerning
them, is so much the more worthy of acceptation, that whereas we are of that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Monkes, who had the chiefest power heretofore in <hi>England,</hi> who had
eleaven Bishopricks in their power, and the Regiment of Cathedrall Churches,
computing also the <hi>Arch-Bishopricke of Canterbury,</hi> if we would doe after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of men, it is more likely for the desire of ancient power, we would rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
the secular Clergy as emulous, than give assistance to them. But wee emulating
the humanity and sincerity of our Fathers, and seeking the glory of Christ, not our
owne honoar, desire the quiet, profit, and encrease of the secular Clergy, as
much as our owne tranquility. Therefore we onely affirme, that these things which
wee have testified of the fore-named Doctors, are so manifestly knowne to all
good men in OVR ENGLAND, that verily they may suffer a great scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall,
whosoever shall dare irreverently to back-bite the said Priests of Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
your tribunall.</p>
                     <p>Therefore we <hi>Benedictines,</hi> your humble Servants and Sonnes, beseech you,
that rejecting their accusations (who denigrate the same of the best Priests,
onely that themselves alone in a <hi>Clergy without an head,</hi> may shine as it were by
an Anteperistisis, that they may seeme <hi>Hierarchicall,</hi> and by a division of mindes
in the Clergy, may thinke that the best way to greatnesse lyeth open to them,) you
would be pleased TO GRANT A BISHOP TO OVR ENG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND,
seeing that no Province of the Catholike world hath more neede
of one, Whether we respect the necessity of the Sacrament <hi>of confirmation,</hi> whose
frequent ministration by the Reverend <hi>Bishop of Calcedon,</hi> hath wonderfully <hi>erected
the minds of our Catholikes,</hi> or the concord &amp; dignity of the Clergy, and the observance
of Ecclesiasticall Discipline, whichseemes by no meanes to be able to be preserved
without <hi>Episcopall Authority:</hi> NEITHER IS IT TO BE DOVBTED
(for we have already scene the GOOD SVCCESSE VNDER THE

               <p>By which passage and Letter it is most apparant: That the Kings match with
the Queen was both in design and event, the greatest means to advance <hi>Popery
in England,</hi> to suspend the Laws &amp; proceeding against Popish Priests and Monks;
and to reduce both the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Prince</hi> to the entertaining and professing of the

of agreement made and sworn to by the <hi>King,</hi> upon the marriage with the
<hi>Queen,</hi> confirme. What power these Benedictine Monks have gained in England
since this letter, appeares by the <hi>Popes</hi> new printed <hi>Briefe</hi> directed to them, and
by this memorable story. Anno 1634. <hi>Lewes Cooke</hi> Generall of the <hi>Benedictines</hi>
dying without issue at Temple Cowly in Oxfordshire, where he had Purchased di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
lands and goods; his brother a Civillian in Ireland hearing of it, comes over
and claimes his lands as heire, his goods as Administrator to him: the <hi>Benedictines</hi>
withstood his claime to both, alleadging, that he purchased both goods and Lands
with the money of the Order, and for their use and maintenance onely. And by Sir
<hi>William Howard,</hi> and their Court friend there, made such a strong party against the
heire, that dispairing of his own right, he made his addresses to Sir <hi>Iohn Bankes</hi> the
Kings Attorny, and procures a Commission of inquiry, with a Fiat under his hand,
dated 2. Ianuary 1635. to intitle the King to the Lands and goods, as a mortmain
purchased to the use of these Monkes; whereupon they compounded with the
heire, and gave him 300, l. as I am credibly informed by Mr <hi>Bernard,</hi> who drew
the commission, wherupon it proceeded no further.</p>

               <p>From all these we may now clearly discover our great swaying Prelates concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
practices and intentions to set up Popery, and easily conjecture that all their late
Innovations, Altars, Images, bowing to Altars, raising and railing in Lords Tables
Altar-wise, Crucifixer, and new licenced popish Pamphlets, tend onely to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
<hi>to bring in the whole body of popery among us,</hi> by degrees; which they have well
nigh effected, and almost quite accomplished.</p>
               <p>This therefore being their cleare resolution, intention, confederacy, as most men
plainely discerne, and generally complaine of; let us all now at last, before it be too
late, ere our Religion be quite lost and betray'd beyond recovery: begin to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
view, and to the utmost of our powers, by all just and lawfull meanes resolve
manfully to oppose, withstand these conspiratours practices, designes, and cry aloud
to <hi>God,</hi> and His <hi>Majesty</hi> for speedy justice upon them, according to the greatnesse
of their Offences, that all others may be terrified from the like perfidious disloyall
attempts.</p>
               <p>O therefore let us now awake out of our drowise security, and be no longer chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with their faire words or specious pretexts, which have hitherto blinded the
eyes of most. Looke but upon their deeds, and these their <hi>complices</hi> testimonies of
them, and then their fained speeches and pretences will vanish into smoke; it being

                  <hi>ancient policy of Lordly Prelates</hi> (the readiest men in all ages both to maintaine
and set up <hi>popery,</hi> with the Popes universall authority.) to <hi>speake most against popery,
when they are busiest to bring it in; and to make the fairest pretences, when they are
plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and executing the foulest designes, of purpose to delude the over-credulous multitude.</hi>
I shall therefore close up all with the words of old <hi>Father Latimer,</hi> in his <hi>fourth Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
before King Edward,</hi> p. 52, 53. where he writes thus of Lordly unpreaching Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,
who bore greatest sway in Church and State, but n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>It is to be thought, that some of them would have it so, to bring in popery againe.
This I feare me is their intent, and it shall be blowne abroad to our holy Father of Romes
eares and he shall send forth his Thunder bolts upon these bruits; and all this doth come
to passe through their un-preaching prelacy. Are they not worthy double honour? nay,
rather double dishonour, not to be regarded, nor to be esteemed among the people, and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:36432:40"/>
to have no living at their hands: For as good Preachers be worthy double honour, so
unpreaching Prelates be worthy double dishonour. They must be at their doublets. But
now these two dishonours, what be they? our Saviour Christ doth shew,</hi> Si sal, &amp;c. If the

First, what certaine or probable <hi>assurance</hi> they can receive from all his <hi>Majesties</hi>
and his evill Councellours late <hi>Declarations</hi> and <hi>Protestations,</hi> not to <hi>connive at
Popery,</hi> but cordially to maintaine the <hi>Protestant Religion in its purity and liberty, to
the utmost of his Regall power;</hi> when as his Majesties ancient engagements by the

of professed <hi>Nuncios</hi> from the Roman Pontise for sundry yeeres in

Warrants, in favour, protection, discharge of the most notorious <hi>Papists, Priests, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits,</hi>
his extraordinnry fresh engagements to the <hi>Queen</hi> and <hi>Popish party,</hi> his arming
of Papists both in <hi>Ireland &amp; England</hi> against the Parliament and Protestant party,
his much distasted <hi>Articles of pacification</hi> with the Irish Rebels, after their most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane

intention, and quite crosse long agitated designe to all the world!</p>
               <p>Secondly, with what confidence at all can they expect; that his Majesty and his

even in an open hostile manner?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, with what conscience, heart, or spirit they can either in point of <hi>piety</hi>

he deserves a brand of eternall infamy, and that he and his posterity should be extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated

               <p>Fiftly, whether His Majesties former arming of English Protestants first (with

to fight against their fellow English Protestants, for to secure the Irish popish
Rebels; and his after arming of English Papists, and present sending for popish Irish
Rebels <hi>as his last and best refuge,</hi> to succeed and second his protestant Forces; with
the placing of his protestant Commanders, Subjects, since their union with his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish

owne party have truely observed, and now complaine of;) be not a most apparent
Jesuiticall plot to engage the Protestants of either party to weaken, kill, and ruine
one and the other, that so the English, Irish, Scottish confederated Papists (who are
still kept furthest off from danger, being rather Spectators then Actors in the hottest
services) may by this their Romish stratagem, speedily become the strongest or most
predominant party, and so easily conquer the Protestants (as well of the Kings as
Parliaments side) and utterly extirpate them, with their Religion, at the last, through
this their desperate folly, and most unnaturall unchristian discord. Certainely, what
ever crafty Jesuited pates may suggest, or impoliticke childish Protestants adhering
to them, conceive to the contrary, yet those who have any skill in Politicks or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiavilian projects, may most clearely discerne this derestable designe against the
Protestants (and our English Nation too, now devoted as a prey to the barbarous
Irish, and other forraigne Popelings) without the helpe of a perspective. And can,
or dare any Protestants then after this discovery of this plot upon them, be any
longer be besotted, as from henceforth to fight for or adhere to those mischievous,
treacherous, popish Conspirators, who rejoyce at this their folly, and would thus
make them the principall instruments of their religions, Countries, yea, their owne
destruction? I shall humbly therefore beseech all protestant Cavaliers, and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parliamenteers
whatsoever, of the contrary party, most seriously to lay this dispe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
plot to heart (as some of the very common English Protestant souldiers (trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported

               <p>Finally, in case the Irish Papists land, and their Faction prevaile, what security
or probility can any <hi>English Protestants</hi> who joyn with them, expect either for the

make warre with the Lamb (who shall over come them, for that he is King of Kings, and
Lord of Lords, and they who are with him are called and chosen, and faithfull:) and who
have committed fornication, and lived deliciously with her, shall bewaile her and lament
for her, when they shall see the smoake of her burning; standing afar off, for the feare of
her torment, saying, Alas, alas that great City Babylon, that mighty City, for in one
hours is thy judgement come &amp;c. For by her sorceries were all Nations deceived: and
in her was found the blood of Prophets and of Saints, and</hi> OF ALL THAT WERE
SLAIN UPON THE EARTH: and therefore all the late shed Protestant
blood in <hi>Ireland,</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> was originally shed by her procurement (as appears
by the <hi>Popes</hi> owne <hi>Briefe</hi> freshly published, <hi>For the inquiry after the death of such
Catholikes here in</hi> England <hi>as shall suffer any kinde of death in</hi> England <hi>for the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Faith or Cause during those wars,</hi> to the end <hi>they may be canonized for glorious
Saints and Martyrs at Rome,</hi> and by other evidences:) and finally, doubtlesse shall
be revenged in her everlasting punishment and subversion.</p>
