            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:51320:3"/>And truly, to my shame I publish it, that at first I was somewhat unpleased with the Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of my thoughts this way, conceiving it the Road to displeasure, and a Voyage of Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack; but as with the Prophet of old, so was it with me; the Resolution to abstain from Good<note place="margin">Psal. 39. 2.</note> words was Pain and Grief to me; for by the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance that I had from God, in its Composure, I saw that somewhat in it might be useful, had it the Cookery of a richer Wit, and readier Pen.</p>
            <p>This is my comfort, I am no Boutefeau, I endeavour no quarrel with Antiquity, Order, Piety, but rather resolve to take the reproach of them upon me; <hi>Speciosum pro Justitia ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptum<note place="margin">Petrach.</note> vulnus;</hi> all that I prefer, is, That God may be honoured by those Gifts which he hath given to men; and that the Foot may not say to the Head, I have no need of thee; nor piety be thought exclusive of Learning, nor any Age happy without Learned Men: For as he said,<note place="margin">Tacit.

            </p>
            <p>There is no subject more seasonable, none less turbulent then is this; for it asserts, whatever is a Foundation, and it shatters, what brings Foundations out of Order, and therefore can be reproached by none but those who misuse Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and mistake Reason, or whose Opinions like B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> yes, rise and sink with their parties; to
<pb facs="tcp:51320:4"/>
whom sober Truth is troublous, and against which they cry, as once the Divels did to Christ, <hi>Art thou come to torment us before our time?</hi> To this there is no other reply to be made then silence, they do not <hi>veritatem quaerere,<note place="margin">Lutheres.</note> sed gloriam &amp; triumphum;</hi> for they are sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with nothing but with wandrings, till they lose, with <hi>Dinah,</hi> their mental modesties, and become Prostitutes to him who leads into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and there leaves them to perish without mercy rescue them.</p>
            <p>This let the world know in confutation of their mistakes; those who are Godlily Learned are no such men as some represent them: Nor do they so much covet to know, as to live answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably and exemplarily, S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> hath long ago vindicated them, <hi>Nos qui Philosophi<note place="margin">Ser. 3. de bono p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            </p>
            <p>I know he that intends by Apologie to do good by perswading men to be good, must not hope to prevaile by falshood and fury, (<hi>Perfidi &amp; rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tores<note place="margin">Tacit. annal. 2.</note> pacis ultioni &amp; gloriae sunt mactandi;</hi>) but by gentle and honest prudence, so allay the wild fire of wit, that it flame not too furiously,
<pb facs="tcp:51320:4"/>
but carry with its edge somewhat of a tender and velvet touch; Therefore have I (by the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of God) so avoided all unnecessary tart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, that those who quarrel with me, must needs confesse themselves guilty of somewhat by me reproved; and those who are sober, not find themselves tempted to any contest beyond that, how they shall be what they seem, and grow better then they are.</p>
            <p>If any thing written by me offend those that are godly and wise, I shall take their reproofs as a precious balm, and intreat them to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that in many things we offend all; and if it be my frailty to erre, it becomes their piety to<note place="margin">Lips. lib. 4. polit.</note> forgive, (<hi>Non cursum eundem tenere opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet sed portum;</hi>) and when they read me, I would counsel them to remember what Saint <hi>Jerome</hi> sayes, <hi>Scio aliter me habere A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolos,<note place="margin">Sanctus Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron. ad Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F ever it were fit to salute the World with a tract calm and serious, if ever it became truth to contest by sober &amp; harmless Rhetorick for its birthright, then may this plea not be preposterous, nor its design unwelcome to those who are qualified to the proportion of its project. I am no <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phipyros,</hi> I carry no firebrand in my Pen: To plead for, not to exasperate against Truth, or to set the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51320:6"/>
World on fire by uncivil and exprobratory sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casms; do I attempt this Work.</p>
            <p>There are too many, whose rapes on the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of paper, make the Press almost execrable, and render the modest World resolute against pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing things in their own nature noble and use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, lest what was by them Christianly intended a brazen Serpent to heal, (through the miscon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of peevish and uncharitable censorious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness) should be termed a fiery Serpent to sting; This inconvenience singly, upon meere prudential grounds, would have deterred me from penning this Apology, were not the honour of God, duty to Truth, and love to Learing much more swasive with me, then vulgar discouragements: yea, did not the noble Presidents of former times cal me (since abler pens will not) to engage in, or rather humbly to endeavour attenuation of that quarrel, which (I hope) is causelesly revived, against the Muses.</p>
            <p>It is, and ever hath been the Policy of Satan, to disturb truth, and by that to foster the success of his diabolick practiques: his expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in these methods of mischief, tels him the high advantage that thereby accrewes to his Kingdom, and the progress thereof: One while he raises war against her, and summons all those that hold of him <hi>in capite,</hi> to attend his standard, hoping by profess'd hostility to suppress the very being of truth, &amp; to chase it into the wilderness to solace it self there with want &amp; obscurity; like that <hi>Athenian Themistocles,</hi> who banished <hi>Aristides,</hi> called <gap reason="foreign">

to the grave: Thus did he by Christ and his holy Apostles, their successors, and the primitive Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs; against all which he raised virulent and san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinary persecutions, accusing them of faction, disloyalty, vice, and every thing that was odious and fameless.</p>
            <p>The falsehood of which criminations, certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to the consciences of many civilized heathens, as well as Christian writers, put them upon Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies, and lenifying discourses, which (to the Powers then in being) they with great success di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected; and by which, Christianity found much relaxation and relief, from the cruel and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satiable persecutions of Ethnick Tyrants.<note place="margin">Vide S.

            <p>And because force could not effect without the consort of fraud, and God had so moderated powred Rulers, that they thought fire and sword ill effects of Politick Government, therefore Satan attempts to beguile those Princely Natures, into actions as conductive to his design, though less clamorous; and this he does by with-drawing those favours of Grandees, which invigor'd Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

Eras. in Adagiis, &amp; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristophanes in Equitibus.</note> Sycophant, that would do any thing for an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage) <hi>Eucrates</hi> has more tricks then one, no trap will easily take him: so may we say of this Serpent (the Devil) whose agent every Godless Man is, He knoweth how to be an Angel of Light, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive (if it were possible) the very Elect.</p>
            <p>Truth, and Learning its hand-mayd, have ever been the objects of the Devils fury, and for many thousands of years he hath laboured by his Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the denigration, if not the total extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them. Anciently, when God was pleased to reveal truth from Heaven, and speak to Men by Visions and Dreams, when he conducted holy Men to holy things by infallible impartment of his Spirit, and by calling to them, This is the way, walk in it, then Arts and Sciences were as useless as milk is to grown Men, or crutches to persons vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous &amp; agile; Then was God all in all to Man, there needed no Library but that of his discovery; no study, but to hear what the Lord will say: then was not Man directed to those mediated helps of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, arts, methods, disquisition, converse, God miraculously supplying his Saints, according to their necessities and his dispensation and good pleasure towards them. But when the World grew old in sin, as in age, he left them to labour out their way to life and light, and to see the toyl sin had exposed them to; while, as nothing naturally grew in the Earth, but weeds, bryars and thorns, without cultivation, so in the mind nothing of true coelestial and virtuous tendency could be or abide, without the polishment of art, and the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of searching after it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:51320:8"/>'Tis confessed, the Pen-men of holy Writ, both Prophets and Apostles, had much of the mind of God revealed to them, which was in order to their work of compilement and ministration, to which God hath appointed them: upon which reason our Lord Jesus chose poor illiterate Men to be his Disciples; knowing that the power of Heaven was to perfect their instruction, and that with God, it was as easie to make as find Men learned; and to teach us, that arts and tongues barely, without supernatural grace, do not enable to Apostleship: but when they were to be left in the World, and sent abroad to preach to all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, then had they gifts of tongues; and art,<note place="margin">August. lib. 2. de Doct. Christ. Bulling. lib. 2. ad H. 8. p. 83.</note> against which no gainsayer was able to stand, as is well observed by holy St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> and after him by learned <hi>Bullinger.</hi>

Then was the Church to see through the glass and prospectives of Arts, and by the ministration of those helps which God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, to the ends of informing the ignorant, convincing the contrarient, and being all things to all Men, that they may gain some.</p>
            <p>And therefore as then it was a grand piece of Atheism for any man to disbelieve Revelations, and to practise contrary to the direction of them, so is it now no less a degree of superstition for any man to wave the authority of Scripture, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on Miracles and Enthusiasms; forasmuch as God hath assigned his written Word for guide to the Church, and bids us search that, as the

            <p>It is not my drift to engage in the conflict 'twixt truth and error, or shew the several pitched fields that in all ages have been fought between them, nor yet to assign those Generals, who in chief have commanded on those parties; that were a work large, and perhaps useless to my purpose: My aemulation is to propose Learning &amp; Learned Men, as the Horsmen and Chariots of any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to discover that without them a People can expect nothing but Barbarity and Bestial Vulpinariness: for as our Country-man <hi>Pitsaeus</hi> sayes, The More men are sunk in<note place="margin">In prooemio relationum rerum Anglica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum p. 23 homines quo magis &amp; igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri, &amp; à bonis literis &amp; disciplinis a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieni, eo propinquius ad agrestem &amp; belluinam vitam accedunt: nam nisi illas animi potentias quibus à belluis distinguimur liberalibus scientiis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colamus, omnis earum virtus perit, &amp; brutis animantibus similes, imò in multis deteriores evadimus.</note> ignorance, and estranged from Arts and Sciences, the neerer come they to the life of Beasts and Savages: for unless the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the mind, by which we are distinguished from bruits, be by liberal sciences ordered and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dified, all their virtue and nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity will degenerate into not only a likeness to, but into a degree of rudeness be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond beasts. Hence is that applicable of the Poet</p>

            <p>And certainly, from this Divine &amp; Architecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick Artist, did man first take encouragement to attempt, and receive power to perfect parts of art; the finger of God in mans Soul, pointing at such emanations as were suteable to the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his creation, ordering the conception to precede the operations, the hand following the formative power of the fancy. Thus God making the world for mans spheare of motion in this short and military life, propensed his Soul to all those tendencies, which chiefly compleat the Harmony of its being, and fit it in many things (immunity from sin and sorrow, possibility of enjoying God face to face, and aeternity excepted) to a confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the upper Region Heaven, to which it is a
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51320:10"/>
tributary, and in which only it shall be perfect and compleat.</p>
            <p>Thus because order is necessary to preservation, as is heat to life, and some must obey as well as others Rule, God so ordered the distribution of his gifts and moral endowments, that the Ruler should have proportions transcending others, as far as the Sun lesser lights; that by clear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction there might obedience be yielded as a due, and yet the persons so Ruled understand their security included in such resignation, without which there would be unavoidable confusion: for a Ruler should be like <hi>Cato,</hi> universally compleat, fit for counsel and conduct, <hi>Optimus Orator, Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timus Imperator, Optimus Senator;</hi> which ternary of complements concludes all.</p>
            <p>And such anciently Rulers were, and so ought still personally to have been, had they been <hi>soli in regimine,</hi> and taken no assistance in govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from other persons, (to rule alone, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps by their own wills, being originally their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative and office) else should they have highly sinned against God and their People by vain and ignorant judgments, which sometimes they might have occasioned: but since they now do by coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel their great actions, and assume others to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise with them, their personal errors are drowned in their cathedral abilities, which can neither do, nor ought to receive wrong. Now because Rulers ought to be <hi>tam Marte quam Mercurio, ex utroque Caesares,</hi> Men fitted to Peace and War, therefore pleased it God to indulge men various &amp; different geniuses, by which, as by silent Oracles and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine inspirings, they should be carried on to works

            <p>To conclude this head; It appears out of the holy story, that there was a grand Colledge at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> in which the Masters of the Law resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and those that were inspired, as by name <hi>Hulda</hi> the Prophetesse; for so we read, 2 <hi>Kings c.</hi> 22. <hi>v.</hi> 14. from which as the fountain, all the other Schools grew; the institution of which, as judicious <hi>Calvin</hi> observes, was, that there should ever be a succession of learning and learned men<note place="margin">Seminarium aliquod semper maneret in Ecclesia Dei, ne destitueretur probis &amp; bonis doctoribus.</note> in the Church of God; that no age of the Church should be without Doctors learned and pious, every way accomplish'd to the Ministry.</p>
            <p>And therefore saith he, when God extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily called any (to promulgate his illimited and absolute power) whom he would send out as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, then did he qualifie them accordingly, and gave them an humble ingenuity to put all their authority and enablement upon a miracle; thus<note place="margin">In cap. 7.

            <p>Now God forbid the Clergy and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Minsterie should in these big looking times of reformation, grow contemptible, who have in all times hitherto, whether of peace or warre, born away a very great share of worship and valuations but if the dayes of visitation are come, and the dayes of recompence are come, wherein the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet is counted a fool, and the spiritual man mad, as the phrase is, <hi>Hosea</hi> cap. 9. v. 7. If the Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of God are with the holy Apostles made a gazing stock, both by reproaches and afflictions, Heb. c. 10. v. 33.

            <p>It is a Government ancient, used and continued in the Church ever since the Apostles times, a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment which God hath honoured with success to all spiritual and holy purposes; under this the Church of God throve, and from this came forth eminent Champions to defend the Truth against both Paganism and Heresie, and to settle the mindes of Christians in it by their dying for it.

(as to the Main) I hope I may without offence to the People of God say ours was: and this I Infinuate not onely to prevent the Advantages that our Adversaries will take hold of to our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, but also to justifie those many holy Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, Bishops, and Presbyters, who ever since our Reformation, yea, in the Bloody daies of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> lived and dyed in the Approbation and Justification of it, and did not Abjure it, or their Orders from it. I do not, nay, I cannot defend the Encroachments, and Illegal Innovations of some late Men, and Times, whose forwardness to Transcend the Bounds of Policie, and sober Pietie, by Rigid Exaction of Obedience in things not Warranted, nor agreed to in the Councels of the Church and State, hath brought such a Rent amongst us, that it hath left no room for Charitie, nay, it hath made all Government in the Church almost Execrable. But I pray Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor for the Constitution, and the worthy Officers in it, that It, and They may not be Traduced, lest the Reproach of them fall upon Christ, and the Religion which hath by it been preserved and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated, and by them written for.</p>
            <p>For although many out of Zeal to their own o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, and perhaps from heat of Oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on lanched out into the Ocean of Argument in the rough Storm of their Passion, and would make the Port of their own Ambition and Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, resolving by the strength of their Wits to force the same belief on others, which they took to themselves; yet, the Sober, Grave, Pious, and Temperate of the Clergie, both Bishops and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sbyters took great heed to their waies, that they

Hence was it that when Disputes about Government were, they distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed between things and things, yea they claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not the Entire Government from Christ, and his holy Institution, lest they should place a <hi>Ius Divinum</hi> in the Hierarchie, and condem, the Government of other Churches; but they wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly considered in Episcopacie what was Ministeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and what was Honorary; what was Essential and what Ornamental; what was Ministerial in Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacie, our Bishops confessed they held in Common with other Presbyters from Christ and his holy Apostles; to Teach, to Distribute the holy Sacraments, with all other parts of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, was equally valid whether done by them or other Presbyters, according to that of S. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose, The Orders of Bishops and Presbyters is one</hi>

So then if Tythes were paid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Levi</hi> was, and paid after to <hi>Levi</hi> as descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from that Priesthood which was Anteceda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous, and must be perpetual (as to the main) to the end of the world: then are Tythes, as Maintenance, no more Jewish and Temporary, then Scripture is, or any thing else that was in use amongst the Jews, and ought to be in use in the Church to the end of the world.</p>
            <p>I apply not this to the <hi>Quota pars,</hi> the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of decimation, but to Tythes so far as they are maintenance, plentiful and proportionate to the Service required from Ministers for them: I urge the Apostles Canon, I <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 13, 14. <hi>Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things, live upon the things of the Temple, and those which wait at the Altar, are partakers with the Altar? even so</hi> (saith he) <hi>hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the Gospel should live of the Gospel:</hi> And if the Priests Levitital were to Live by their labour and attendance, shall not the Priest-hood Evangelical and perpetual subsist it self upon the Gospel, and its Professors? that would be unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable and sensless; for God requires no more then he gives; if he expect the Labourers pains, <hi>he will think the Labourer worthy of his hire.</hi> So saith our Lord, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. 7. applied by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 18. to the Ministers of the Gospel, who
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:51320:53"/>
who ought to be rewarded for their pains and travel, where he saith, <hi>The Scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the Oxe that tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out the corn; the labourer is worthy of his hire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And were there no other Argument for Tythes as Maintenance, yet the Right of them would be Evinceable out of the Rule of meer Analogie, and Proportion, which the Apostle hints when he saies, <hi>If we have sowen unto you spiritual things, is it a great matter if we reap your carnal things?</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 11. where the Apostle by an Elegant ratiocination, convinces the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> that their contribution to their Teachers and the Apostles, is far beneath their deserts: that still they are the Ministers Debtors: Why? <hi>we sow the seed of immortality and life amongst you; we enfranchise you of heaven, and make you citizens of the heavenly Ierusalem; you pay us but in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible things, as Silver and Gold, with what is like your selves, mortal and impermanent;</hi> and does not the disparitie between the Work and the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges argue you stil debtors to us?</p>
            <p>In all Professions and courses of life there is a return of Labour, and a gain ordinarily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate to the toil: the Merchant when he ventures a long voyage, expects a large profit, and he has it, and well deserves it; a servants wages, the price of his toil is his due, and 'twere injurie to detain it from him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a Souldiers pay is his due, and 'twere dishonestie to keep him (if we could) without it; the Physician and Lawyer have Fees for their counsels, and pleadings, and all Artists prizes for their Works and Wares, and

'tis fit they should be contented for them: and must the Church-man be the onely <hi>Capuchin</hi> or <hi>Mendicant?</hi> Must he onely live upon Alms and Charitie?

What more Variety, Verity, Eloquence, rare Extasies of Devotion and holy Language in all that vast Continent of Books, which men have in all Ages and Arts written; then in that little Spot and Jewell of divine Writ? It is beyond any mans power to instance any one Directory that may, or hath conveyed that light to the Church, by which we may infallibly walk, and by it be conducted to the light that is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, as the Book of God doth.

            <p>There is another Objection against Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which I find forwarded by many opposites; That as great things have been done by unlearned as learned men: The Turks Conquest over a part of Christendom, as well as over the Asian world, confirms this: And say they, the providence and foresight of Men Learned, often disanimateth their Attempts of things which event stiles suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessfull.</p>
            <p>My Reply is, That no things so great have been done by unlearned as learned Men: The prealledged Deliverances of Israel from Egypt by <hi>Moses</hi> their Chieftain; the Conquests of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> and <hi>Caesar,</hi> were greater then those of the Turk, if we consider the time in which, and the number by which they effected them: Long time hath brought the Turk to this height, and

Can ye without sorrow consider your misery and leannesse, if your Teachers should be removed into corners, and your scholers grow like the Mountains of <hi>Gilboa,</hi> upon which the dew of greatnesse and support fals not?
