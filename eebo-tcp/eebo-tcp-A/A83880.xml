         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas heretofore it pleaſed God in the very dayes of Thankeſgiving for former Mercies, to meet us with new; as if hee
had taken notice of our Thankfulneſſe, and encouraged us to it, as a duty that gives him both Honour and delight:
Now, the infinite goodneſſe of the ſame gracious God hath prevented our day of Thankeſgiving (lately appointed for
the bleſſed ſucceſſe of the Parliaments Army at <hi>Torrington,)</hi> with many Mercies and Succeſſes in ſundry parts of this
Kingdom; and hath ſent them to us as grounds and encouragements to give him on this day a larger, fuller, and more
zealous Thankeſgiving: For the further advancement whereof, there are many obſervable paſſages of Divine providence.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place we may take notice that <hi>Ragland</hi> Caſtle in <hi>Wales</hi> was long fortified by the Earl of <hi>Worceſter</hi> a Papiſt, which of late
much increaſed in ſtrength, and committed many cruelties upon the County of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> plundering, firing, and deſtroying Towns
and Houſes; having the whole Country under their power, except ſome few Gariſons of the Parliaments, no way able to reſiſt them.
The <hi>Ragland</hi> Horſe drew towards <hi>Cardiffe</hi> in <hi>Glamorgan-ſhire,</hi> a Parliament Gariſon; whereupon the Governour and Committee there,
ſent to Collonel <hi>Kerne</hi> lately appointed High Sheriffe by the Parliament, and to the reſt of the Country to riſe in a body to oppoſe
the Enemy: but contrary to expectation, Collonel <hi>Kerne</hi> and the Malignant Gentry being at their Rendezvouze, prevailed with the
people to beſiege <hi>Cardiffe,</hi> which was done with about 2000 men: they tooke the Towne in a ſhort time, having the aſſiſtance of the
Malignant Towneſmen. The Governour, Committee, and Souldiers betook themſelves to the Caſtle; Gods Providence ſo caſt it,
that Major Generall <hi>Laughorne,</hi> Sir <hi>Trevor Williams</hi> and Collonell <hi>Keyrle</hi> came in ſeaſon, (Proviſion being almoſt ſpent in the Caſtle,)
and fought with the Countrey-men and <hi>Ragland</hi> Forces, (who were joyned on a Heath neare the Town,) Routed them, tooke many
Priſoners, and forced them to fly back to the Town: Major Generall <hi>Laughorne</hi> purſued, and relieved the Caſtle; the Enemy conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
in the Towne a while; at laſt Articles were agreed, That they ſhould march away with Colours flying, Match lighted, &amp;c. But
having marched ſome diſtance from the Towne, occaſion was given by the Enemy for breach of Articles, whereupon they engaged
in a very hot fight, in which were ſlaine and drowned of the Enemy neare 400, about 500 taken Priſoners, the reſt ſcattered and
fled. We loſt very few men in this ſervice, though many hurt: had this treacherous Plot taken effect, South-Wales had been loſt
again, which probably would have afforded thouſands to the King to joyne in a body with Sir <hi>Jacob Aſhley,</hi> who drew his Forces that
way. This, if rightly conſidered with the circumſtances, is none of the leaſt mercies, among many late ſucceſſes and Victories which
God hath vouchſafed us.</p>
            <p>The deliverance alſo of <hi>Abbington</hi> is an obſervable Mercy. The Enemy came to <hi>Abbington</hi> with a 1000 Horſe, and about a 1000
Foot; they drave our men from the Works, and entred above 300 men, and poſſeſt themſelves of ſundry Guards, Works, and the
Magazine it ſelf; but our Horſe and Foot reſiſted them valiantly, routed them, and made them quit their ground, God at that time
raiſing their Spirits to a great height of Reſolution.</p>
            <p>After the taking of <hi>Torrington</hi> in <hi>Devon,</hi> ſome Forces advancing towards <hi>Stratton</hi> in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> and the Enemy making reſiſtance, it
pleaſed God to put them to flight, and there were taken about 300 Horſe, and 80 Priſoners.</p>
            <p>After this our Army came to <hi>Launceſton</hi> a chief Town in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> which after ſome oppoſition they took, with the Armes and
Magazine in it. And it may be worthy both of notice and Thankeſgiving, that our Souldiers there were ſo temperate and obedient,
that notwithſtanding the oppoſition made at the Towne; yet they did not plunder ſo much as one Houſe; which no queſtion was a
great Conqueſt upon themſelves, and advanced much the conquering of that County; eſpecially ſince before the Armies comming to
<hi>Launceſton,</hi> the people were poſſeſt with an opinion that there would be no mercy ſhown to the Corniſh.</p>
            <p>It is alſo obſervable, that God hath ſtrucken the Enemy with a terror there; and divers perſons of quality ſend for Protections, and dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
make their ſubmiſſions; and not above 80 Foot appeared upon the calling of their Poſe; whereas heretofore thouſands have appeared.</p>
            <p>And now our Army advancing towards <hi>Bodmin,</hi> a Town about twenty miles within <hi>Cornwall,</hi> the enemy did quit the Town by night,
<hi>Hopton</hi> himſelf bringing up the Reare of them. In thoſe parts ſix Troopers drove away the Convoy of four Load of Ammunition;
and four Troopers overtaking 42 Musketeers with Matches lighted, and Muskets loaden, made them all lay down their Armes, and
brought them back Priſoners.</p>
            <p>The maine body of the Enemies Army, conſiſting moſt of Horſe is driven far into <hi>Cornwall,</hi> and being ſhut up behinde by our
Forces, is incloſed both before and on every ſide by the Sea, and hath little reſt, being Alarm'd by our parties.</p>
            <p>Beyond all this, God hath delivered not onely their Forces and Forts, but their Counſells into our hands; and the delivering up of
their Counſells, delivers alſo their Cauſe: For by Gods eſpeciall Providence, a Ship comming into <hi>Padſtow</hi> (a Sea Town in <hi>Cornwall,)</hi>
and bringing in divers of the native Iriſh (moſt of which, thoſe of the Town deſtroyed) there came alſo with them a Packet of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
from <hi>Ormond, Clamorgan,</hi> and <hi>Digby,</hi> which being caſt into the Sea was recovered again, and contained matters of great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
that concern the bringing in of a multitude of Iriſh into this Kingdom. Thus their Counſells being brought to light, their
Cauſe therein appears moſt abominable, while there muſt needs be a likeneſſe between it, and thoſe that ſupport it: now the ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of it are Idolatrous and bloody Iriſh Rebells and Traytors.</p>
