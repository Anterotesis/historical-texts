            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE AUTHOR TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THE Person who gives being to the trouble I am now put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting my self to, is so well known for a <hi>Malecontent,</hi> and his Writings of so little Repute, that I should take no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of notice of him, had he not been appointed the Mouth of a Party which would level their own with Crown'd Heads, and bring down those who have any seeming advantage over 'em. But since he is not content to be uninterrupted at his <hi>Calves Head Feast,</hi> to write against the Commissioners of the <hi>Victualing Office,</hi> at the same time when he had starv'd without their Assistance, to buz about Maladministration in those of the Admiralty, when he could prove nothing like it, but must needs arrogate to himself miserable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections on the best constituted Government in the World, and strike at the Person of his <hi>Sovereign</hi> in those he has been pleased to <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> with his Favours; I could not but think it my Duty to give him the Correction which was due to him, though it falls short of what he deserves. As for the Method I have taken; the Reason which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd me to Print his <hi>wretched</hi> Rhimes Line for Line was, because I would give some advantage to my <hi>Own</hi> which follow <hi>His</hi> Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph by Paragraph; and would expose those ridiculous Reflections to a <hi>Second</hi> Perusal, which have found too much favour at <hi>First.</hi> I intend it not so much for an Answer, as to put him in a more Methodical way when he shall write again; and to shew him what a dull <hi>Animal</hi> of a <hi>Malignant</hi> he is. I might indeed have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected upon his Incongruities, pointed at the several escapes he has made from the confinement of Sence, and examin'd his Expressions and lamentable turns of Thought; But I forbore <hi>Particulars,</hi> to make him a <hi>General</hi> Block-head, and if I have done that, I have gain'd my aim.</p>
