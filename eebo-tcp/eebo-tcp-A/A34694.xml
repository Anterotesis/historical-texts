            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Petitioner, together with <hi>James Caroll</hi> the
Elder, the Petitioners Father, having occaſion
to Travel in your Majeſties Kingdome of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
to buy Wool, Skins, and other Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
relating to the Calling of your Petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
did on the 12<hi>th</hi> day of <hi>April</hi> 1672. ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
at <hi>Tortumlin</hi> in the County of <hi>Galloway,</hi>
a Town belonging to the Earl of <hi>Clanriccard,</hi>
and took up their lodging at the houſe of the
abovenamed <hi>Thomas Allin</hi> an Innkeeper living at the <hi>Blackſpread-Eagh</hi>
there.</p>
            <p>The ſaid <hi>Thomas Allin</hi> falling into diſcourſe with them, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
them to be <hi>Iriſh,</hi> (your Petitioners Father ſpeaking that
tongue) did demand of them <hi>What News there was abroad?</hi> to which
they replyed, that they had been Travelling up and down the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
but had heard no ſtrange News, whereupon the ſaid <hi>Allin</hi> told
them in Engliſh as followeth, <hi>Viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If (<hi>ſaid he</hi>) we have news that the Dutch are beaten, then my Lord
of <hi>Clanriccard</hi> will preſently ſound a Trumpet and I will go along with
him, and three or four ſcore more of this Town, well Hors'd and
well Arm'd, and every man five pounds in his pocket, and I hope I
ſhall kill one hundred of the Proteſtants, Anabaptists, Independants,
and ſuch like Phanatick people, before I am killed: for I expect a
Quartermasters place myſelf, and I will have ſome of them upon the
point of my Sword before the laſt of <hi>June.</hi> And as for thoſe that are
here in this Countrey, we will ſoon cut them off, for they ſhall have no
help to come from the other ſide of the Brook (<hi>meaning England</hi>) there
ſhall be no ſhipping to come to help them, for we will cut them off in a
Months time, we ſhall be twelve to one, we will leave them neither Root
nor Branch, and not ſpare them as in the former Riſing.</p>
            <p>The Petitioner ſitting at the Table with the ſaid <hi>Allin,</hi> and his
ſaid Father, took out his Pocket book, and his Pen and Ink, and in
his ſaid Pocket book did write down the aforeſaid words as the ſaid
<hi>Allin</hi> ſpoke them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:104244:2"/>
The Petitioners Father hearing the ſaid <hi>Allin</hi> ſpeak the words
aforeſaid replyed, This is ſtrange news indeed; to which the ſaid
<hi>Allin</hi> rejoynd: <hi>Why did you not hear what was spoken at Maſs laſt day,
(Which was the</hi> Eaſter. Monday <hi>before) at every word curſing the</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh,
<hi>and declaring their wicked and bloody intentions againſt them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Petitioner upon his return to <hi>Dublin,</hi> holding himſelf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
in bounden duty and Allegiance to your Sacred Majeſty, and
natural affection to his Countrey-men the Engliſh Proreſtants of
that Kingdome, to make known ſuch Treaſonable words againſt
your Majeſties Crown and Dignity, did repair to Doctor <hi>Toppham</hi>
a Maſter of Chancery there, and upon his corporal Oath, did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
to him the whole buſineſs as aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>The next day after which Declaration, your Petitioner was ſent
for to appear before the Lord <hi>Berkeley,</hi> your Majeſties then Lord
Lieutenant there, by whom he was examined concerning the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
which he again confirmed upon three ſeveral Examinations,
before the ſaid Lord Lieutenant and your Majeſties Councel there;
after which he was ſent for before Sir <hi>Robert Rooth</hi> Chief Juſtice of
the Common Pleas, and by him engaged to proſecute the ſaid <hi>Tho.
Allin</hi> for the Treaſonable words aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>The ſaid <hi>Tho. Allin</hi> being ſent for by a Purſevant, who miſt to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tach
him, did ſoon after appear at <hi>Dublin,</hi> and with him the Earl of
<hi>Clanriccard,</hi> the ſaid <hi>Allin</hi> being examined before the ſaid Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
and Councel, concerning the Treaſonable words ſpoke by him
as aforeſaid, did deny the ſame with dreadful execrations and Oaths
confirming the ſame, with aſſerting that the Petitionar was neither
at his houſe nor at the ſaid town of <hi>Portumlin,</hi> at the time before
mentioned, whereupon the Petitioner being examined in the preſence
of the ſaid <hi>Allin</hi> confirmed the Accuſation aforeſaid, and did further
prove his being there contrary to the aſſertion of the ſaid <hi>Allin,</hi> by
a Bond taken at that time for performance of a Bargain of Goods
the Petitioner had bought and to which one <hi>Simon Allin</hi> Brother
of the ſaid <hi>Tho. Allin,</hi> was witneſs, whoſe hand the ſaid <hi>Tho. Allin</hi>
could not deny, offering further to prove the truth of what he had
aſſerted by his ſaid father <hi>James Carrol,</hi> if his Excellency and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
would pleaſe to ſend for him. But they being fully ſatisfied of the
truth of the Premiſſes from the Petitioners circumſtantial Evidence
ſought for no more, but then proceeded to preſs the ſaid <hi>Allin</hi> to make
an ingenious confeſſion of the whole truth, telling him if he did not, it
would be worſe for him; But he perſiſting obſtinately in denyal
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:104244:3"/>
thereof twas by them ordered to be committed cloſe Priſoner without
Bail or Main-price, commanding the Goaler to take him away. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs,
the ſaid <hi>Allin</hi> was at liberty the ſame day, upon what mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
the Petitioner troubled himſelf not to inquire, being ſatisfied that
he had diſcharged his duty.</p>
            <p>About two Months after, the Petitioner with his ſaid Father, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a new occaſion to travel into the ſaid County of <hi>Galloway,</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
at the River <hi>Shanon</hi> near <hi>Portumlin</hi> aforeſaid, where the wind
being high, it was late before the Ferry-Boat could paſs them over to
<hi>Portumlin</hi> ſide, where arriving on a <hi>Saturday</hi> night and finding the
Inhabitants of that place to gaze upon them, &amp; to draw Tumultouſly
together they believ'd it not ſafe to continue there, and though very
Wet and Weary, did rather chuſe to travel four Miles farther, to a
lone houſe ſtanding on the road to <hi>Laughrea,</hi> but ſix miles ſhort of that
place whether they intended to go had not the delay at the Ferry pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
them, but the next morning being the <hi>Lord's</hi> day, came into
<hi>Laughrea</hi> aforeſaid, about ſeven in the morning, and there ſtayed all
day and night.</p>
            <p>But very early on <hi>Monday</hi> morning (at the Inſtigation of the ſaid
<hi>Tho. Allin</hi> and other his accomplices) the Conſtable of <hi>Laughrea,</hi>
with others with them, rudely throwing open their Chamber door,
and affrighting the Petitioner and his ſaid father out of their ſleep, did
attach them by Vertue of a Warrant from one <hi>Donnolan</hi> Steward
to the ſaid Earl of <hi>Clanriccard</hi> and Juſtice of Peace, on pretence of
Travelling on the <hi>Sabbath</hi> day (though ſeveral of the Neighborhood
had come in with Cart and Horſes loden from a fair the day before,
twenty Miles from thence, and were for their more Notorius travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
on the <hi>Sunday,</hi> no ways moleſted by them) they further Seized
on a caſe of Piſtols and two Swords belonging to this Petitioner and
his ſaid Father, lying on the Table, and only uſed for their defence,
telling them thy believ'd they intended to kill ſome body with them,
which Arms they never yet could get reſtor'd, ſo forcing them out
of their Beds, they carried them ſix miles before one Juſtice <hi>Dean,</hi>
who reproving them for travelling on the <hi>Lord's</hi> day; told them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
that he had heard they had given in Evidence againſt the ſaid Earl
of <hi>Clanriccard,</hi> and ſo commited them to Priſon to <hi>Laughrea,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he commanded the Conſtable to carry them, and not to take Bail,
though he pretended to this Petitioner and his ſaid Father, they might
give Bail.</p>
            <p>In this Priſon of <hi>Laughrea</hi> they remained five days without any
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:104244:3"/>
covering but the Clothes on their backs, or any Bed to lye on; none
daring all that while to relieve them (though willing enough) either
by Bailing them, ſpeaking to them, or conveying a Letter for them
to <hi>Galloway,</hi> but eleven Miles thence, though they proffered any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
for it, and their own Horſes to ride on, being charged at their
Perils to the contrary, and fearing the diſpleaſure of the Earl of <hi>Clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riccard:</hi>
The better to colour which proceeding, they Inſtigated ſome
to report that the Petitioner's Father had a deſign to Burn the ſaid
Town of <hi>Laughrea,</hi> pretending that beſides that information they had
ſeven or eight Indictments to bring againſt them at <hi>Galloway</hi> Aſſizes.
Thus they lay in that Goal, and might perhaps till this time, had not
the Petitioner by ſtrange accident out at a window, obtained the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance
of a Letter to ſome friends of theirs at <hi>Galloway,</hi> who thereby
underſtanding their ſad Condition, made Application to the Judges
of Aſſize then there, and obtained an order for their removal thither
wither they were brought by the Goaler late at night, and clapt into
the vildeſt Priſon in all that Town, amongſt the condemned Rogues
and Malefactors, without any Accommodation.</p>
            <p>The next morning they were brought before the Judges, where an
Indictment for Travelling on the <hi>Sabboth</hi> day, was read againſt them
both. And another Malicious one againſt your Petitioner's Father,
for the Fictitious intent of firing <hi>Laughrea</hi> beforenamed, which no
man appear'd for to make good: To the firſt on the Courts demands
they ſubmitted: to the laſt your Petitioner's Father put in a Traverſe,
and though no Proſecutors appeared, they were forced to give One
thouſand Pounds Security not to depart the Town till the end of the
Aſſizes; at the end of which, being fifteen days after, they were again
bound to their good Behaviour, and to appear the next Aſſizes after,
which they accordingly did, though above 100 Miles from their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations,
where, after ſtaying fifteen days more, and no evidence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
to make good their Indictment, they were diſcharged by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation,
paying Fees: No remedy being found for ſo great Afflict
ions, as they ſuſtain'd by the aforeſaid ernel Uſage, and hard Travel,
extraordinary Expences, loſs of Time, and hindrance in their Callings
and Buſineſs.</p>
            <p>But as if all this malicious proceeding had been nothing, your Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioner
had not been return'd to <hi>Dublin</hi> above a week, to follow his
imployment, but he was Arrested in the name of the ſaid Earl of <hi>Clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riccard,</hi>
in an Action of 10000<hi>l.</hi> on pretence that he had ſlandered
the ſaid Earl, to the dammage of the ſaid Sum: And thereupon was
<pb facs="tcp:104244:4"/>
hurryed to Priſon: where, after lying four dayes, he procured Bayl,
and being ready to come forth, had another Action of 20000<hi>l.</hi> in the
ſaid Earls name laid upon him, when having after two or three dayes
more procured Bayl to that too, he was again detained on a third
Action at the ſame Earls Sute for 30000<hi>l.</hi> all three amounting to
Threeſcore thouſand pounds, laid upon him utterly to ruine him, by
keeping him in Priſon all days of his life; but after fourteen dayes
durance, your Petitioner procured by <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> to be brought
to the Common-Pleas Barr, where tendering Bayl to all the ſaid Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
the ſaid Earls Councel moved to have time to conſider of the
ſufficiency of the ſaid Bayl, which was granted by the Court till
next day, and the Petitioner remanded. But then the ſaid Earls
Councel in open Court, told the Judges that they had no advice from
the ſaid Earl to proſecute the Petitioner, and that they conceived
ſome perſons had proſecuted him out of malice, or purpoſe to curry
fovour with the ſaid Earl, and deſired he might be ſet at liberty, and
accordingly he was paying Fees without Bayl, but left without all
remedy to recover his charges and damages, the ſaid Earl being now
declared to be no proſecutor, though the Actions were in his name.</p>
            <p>But all this vexation ſuffiſed not, but being fully reſolved on the
deſtruction of the Petitioner, for his innocent, though zealous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of his duty in revealing the ſaid Treaſonable words: he
was again, about a week after, Arreſted by a Action out of the Kings
Bench at the ſaid Earls Sute, to which he gave Bayl, and again, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
a week after, was Arreſted at the ſame Earls ſute in another Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
out of the ſaid Court, to which he likewiſe gave Bayl: The firſt of
which actions was diſmiſt for Non Proſ. on the ſecond was decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that the Petitioner had ſlandered the ſaid Earl, to the damage of
2000l. and though the ſaid Action was brought in <hi>Dublin</hi> and the
Declaration put in there, the ſaid Earles Councel moved the <hi>Venne</hi>
might be laid in <hi>Galloway</hi> and the Action tryed there; whereupon
the ſaid <hi>James</hi> Petitioned the Court that it might be tryed in <hi>Dublin,</hi>
ſetting forth that <hi>Dublin</hi> was the place where he had made diſcovery
of the Treaſonable words ſpoken by <hi>Allin,</hi> on which the Action was
grounded, that his Witneſs to prove <hi>Allin</hi> ſpake thoſe words, was in
<hi>Dublin,</hi> that <hi>Galloway</hi> was a place where the Earl was very potent,
he keeping his Courts there, and above One hundred Miles from the
Petitioner, and his witneſſes habitation, which travel would be to
his Coſt, Charge, and Damage, beſides, the eminent danger of his
Life in coming thither from thoſe rude and Exaſperated perſons that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:104244:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
liv'd on the way: That what he had done, was in faithful diſcharge of
his duty to your Sacred Majeſty, wherein he had done the ſaid Earl
no wrong, nor never had cauſe to do that, if the ſaid Earl was any
ways ſlandered, it was by the ſaid <hi>Thomas Allin,</hi> againſt whom in right
and juſtice, he ought to take his remedy, and not againſt the ſaid
Petitioner. Yet notwithſtanding, ſeveral Petitions, to the Effect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid,
preſet'd to like Court, they were all over-ruled by Judge
<hi>Jones,</hi> the only Judge then upon the <hi>Bench,</hi> and he forced to Travel
with his Witneſs to <hi>Galloway,</hi> to attend the ſaid Tryal; where ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving,
he could get no Counſel for Money, to plead for him, when
Petitioning the Judges to Aſſign him ſome, the Earls Counſel urged
there were three at the Barr, unretain'd by the ſaid Earl, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
all <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts: Yet the Petitioner was forced to be contented
to retain them or none.</p>
            <p>The Matter in Iſſue, was for the Petitioner to prove that the ſaid
<hi>Allin</hi> had ſpoke the Treaſonable words aforeſaid, which he did ſo
well, that one of his Counſel told the Court, that the Evidence was
ſo full, that if it had been given againſt a Malefactor, it had been ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,
but was over-rul'd by Judge <hi>Jones</hi>'s ſaying that was not the
Caſe now, and beckoning with his hand when he ſpake the word, ſo
that none of the Petitioners Counſel opened their mouth after; yet
Judge <hi>Povey</hi> told the Jury that it was ſufficiently proved, <hi>Allin</hi> had
ſpoken thoſe words: However, the Jury being ſome of them Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawed,
ſome of them Tenants, ſome Bayliffs, and all one way or other
related to the ſaid Earl, he himſelf being preſent at the ſaid Tryal,
brought in a Verdict againſt the Petitioner for 2000 <hi>l.</hi> Damages, and
6<hi>d.</hi> Coſt, and hath ſince in <hi>Dublin,</hi> obtained Execution againſt the
Petitioner for the ſame.</p>
            <p>This Petitioner hath been ſince perſwaded to ſubmit himſelf to the
ſaid Earl, and confeſs his Fault, and to ſay that what he hath done,
was at the Inſtigation of ſome others, which was his only way to
be ſafe; elſe, it was added, that let the Petitioner return to <hi>Dublin</hi>
which way he would, there were thoſe related to the Earl would meet
with him, &amp; do his work for him: (This was in <hi>Galloway</hi> ſoon after the
ſaid Tryal) to which this Petitioner replyed, that he was never put
on by any one, that what he had declared, was no more than what
<hi>Allin</hi> had ſaid: and what if he was to do again, he would do as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
him in duty, but that he would take the beſt care of himſef he
could, in returning home, truſting to God to preſerve him from ſuch as
ſought unjuſtly to do him hurt: And to that purpoſe finding himſelf
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:104244:5"/>
often threatned and ſometimes ſtruck, in <hi>Galloway</hi> he was forced, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with his ſaid Father, to get thence in the night, to forſake the
common Road, and to go all the by ways they could, to ſecure their
Lives, they having been ſince credibly informed, that they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued
by ſeven perſons neer ſixty Miles, who miſſing of them returned.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly.</hi> That he proved the ſame to the full-ſatisfaction of your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
