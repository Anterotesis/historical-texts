            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Desire thee to
take notice, that
by <hi>Polygamy</hi> or
<hi>Plurality of wives,</hi>
handled in this
Treatise, is not
meant that base
practise of certain
impudent, shark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:100063:7"/>
rogues, whose
manner is, to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
a Wife in one
City or town, and
devoure her Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
and abuse
her Body, and
then run away to
some far distant
place, and marry
another, leaving
the first, with po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poverty,
shame,
and, it may be, a
great Belly to

boot; to be sure,
sorrow enough, at

They remove
their Quarters &amp;
make bold with a
third, till the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
catch them.
For such hard-hearted
and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Rogues and
vagabonds, are by
<pb facs="tcp:100063:8"/>
the Laws of this
Nation to be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> death, &amp;
that (I conceive)
more justly then
common thievs &amp;

Subject Question
of this Treatise is,
<hi>Whether he that</hi>
(if the Law of
the Land gave
way) <hi>should with
the Consent of his
first Wife, upon just
<pb facs="tcp:100063:8"/>
grounds and reasons
marry a second, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

sufficiently for
them &amp; their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and living
with them as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes

Question I say of
this Treatise, is,
<hi>Whether this Man
in so doing, should
offend against any

            <p>I Desire your advice; which
because I conceive you are
both able and willing to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
me: therefore it is I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress
my self unto you.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Och.</speaker>
               <p>I am indeed willing, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
it be within the reach of
my understanding and ability.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tel.</speaker>
               <p>In the first place, I beg of
you, That you will faithfully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to keep my Counsel.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Och.</speaker>
               <p>I am content, if I may do
it, without dishonouring God.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Tel.</speaker>
               <p>I have a Wife not suitable
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100063:13"/>
to my minde, so that I cannot
love her, and as far as I can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
she is both barren, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>healthful;
and I finde my self so
disposed, that I cannot want the
Company of a Woman: also I
desire to have Children, both
for Posterities sake, and that I
may instruct them in the fear of
God. I could indeed keep a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubine
or two, but my Conscience
will not suffer me: also I could
falsly charge my Wife with Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
and so put her away; but in
so doing, I should both offend
God, and blemish mine own, and
my Wives reputation, which I
will not do. I could also poyson
her, which is a thing I abhorre.
But a thought is come into my
minde, to take another Wife, so as
to keep her that I have already,
notwithstanding; and I conceive
God has put this into my minde,
and that I am thereunto called by
him: my desire therefore is, that
you will tell me whether, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the word of God, I may
lawfully do it.</p>

Och.</speaker>
               <p>In doubtful cases 'tis fit
to take advice, but the case is clear,
that a man ought not to have
more Wives then one, because the
condition of Mariage is such, that
it cannot be between more then
two.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tel.</speaker>
               <p>How can you make that
appear?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Och.</speaker>
               <p>God at the beginning made
out of <hi>Adam,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 2.</note> only one Woman,
and gave her to him; signifying,
that he ought to have but one and
that Matrimony ought to be only
of two persons. If he would have
had a Man to have more Wives,
he would doubtless have made
him more, especially at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the World, when pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation
was more necessary,
then ever afterwards.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tel.</speaker>
               <p>I conceive, this Argument
is of small validity. God gave to
our first Father <hi>Adam</hi> one Wife,
therefore it is unlawful for any
man to have more.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Och.</speaker>
               <p>If it had been the will of
God that he should have more, he
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100063:14"/>
would have given him more, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
in that state of perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
wherein he was pleased to put
him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tel.</speaker>
               <p>A bare act of God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any precept added thereunto,
does not obliege us to imitate the
same; for if so, then we are bound
to weare Coats of Skin, because
God so cloathed our first Parents,
and it were unlawful to wear
Cloth or Silk. For your Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
would alwayes be of force.
God cloathed them with Skins,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note>
and he could have cloathed them
with Cloth or Silk, if it had been
his pleasure, that men should be
so cloathed. If an Act of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
do bind us as much as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,
so that Gods giving <hi>Adam</hi>
one Wife only, were as much in
effect, as if he had said to him, I
will and command, that every
man have one only Wife; it would
follow, that not only it should be
unlawful for a man to have more
Wives then one, but that every
man that did not take a Wife, it
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100063:14"/>
being in his power so to do,
should sin, which is contrary to
the Doctrine of St. <hi>Paul.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Och.</speaker>
               <p>You must understand, that
<hi>Paul</hi> is not contrary to God. For
in that, God gave only one Wife
to <hi>Adam,</hi> it was all one, as if he
had said, I would not have a man
to have more Wives then one, and
it is my pleasure, that he have <hi>one,</hi>
unless I shall call him to a single
life,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.</note> and give him the gift of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity,
and that is the intent of
<hi>Paul.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tel.</speaker>
               <p>And I for my part must
say, that when God gave <hi>Adam</hi>
one Wife, it was as if he had said,
It is my pleasure, that a man shall
have one Wife; if either he want
the gift of continency, or I shall
call him to a married condition.
It is also my pleasure, that he shall
have no more; unless he stand in
need of more, or I shall call him
to more: which is at this time my
condition, who stand in need of,
and am called to marrie ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:100063:15"/>
Och.</speaker>
               <p>That a single life is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to God, the word of God
shewes; but we are not thereby
taught, that he is pleased, Men
should have more then one
Wife.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Och.</speaker>
               <p>Nay verily, both Gods
word, and the Saints example, do
reach the same, as we shall shew
by and by. But go to; suppose, it
had been Gods pleasure, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man should have so many
Wives, as it was possible for him
rightly to govern, and instruct to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with their Children: how
many Wives must he have given
<hi>Adam,</hi> thereby to signifie his
pleasure in this point?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Och.</speaker>
               <p>You suppose that which
cannot be, seeing the having more
Wives than one, is repugnant to
true Matrimony.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tel.</speaker>
               <p>You have not yet made it
clear to me, that to have more
Wives then one is repugnant to
Mariage, otherwise then by say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that God gave <hi>one</hi> to <hi>Adam,</hi>
Let us now suppose he had given
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100063:15"/>
him more; doubtless, from that
first Institution you could not
prove, that a man ought not to
have more; nay, it would follow
of necessity, that a man might
have more. How many Wives
therefore in such a case, had it
been necessary for God to give
<hi>Adam,</hi> to signifie his pleasure in
this point?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Och.</speaker>
               <p>Two would have been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tel.</speaker>
               <p>Now then, if that Action
of his had bin a praecept, as you
say, it would have bin unlawful
for men to have had more or less
then two Wives: which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless,
would not have been an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
to his will, seeing his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
was, that they should have as
many as they could govern. We
must therefore confess, that by a
bare act of God: no command be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
added, we are not obliged to
the imitation thereof. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
it would be sin for a Minister
to celebrate the Lords Supper, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
the Communicants were just
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100063:16"/>
so many in number, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
of Christ were, when he
instituted the same.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Och.</speaker>
               <p>Although it does not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
follow, that because God
gave one Wife to <hi>Adam,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is unlawful for a man to
have more; yet is it doubtless, a
very probable Argument, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade,
&amp; urges strongly, though it
be not altogether compulsive.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tel.</speaker>
               <p>Nay verily, it urges not at
all: since it may be said, that God
gave one Wife to <hi>Adam,</hi> not to
shew that his will was, that every
man should have but one Wife;
but that the rest of man-kind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
born as well of one Mother, as
one Father, might love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
so much the more: also that
<hi>Eve</hi> being made of the Rib of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
might be a figure of the holy
Church, the onely Spouse of
Christ.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Och.</speaker>
               <p>Go to, let us come unto
the words of the Text. Do you
not think that <hi>Adam</hi> was moved
by divine instinct, when he said;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100063:16"/>
                  <hi>For this cause shall a man leave his
Father, and Mother, and cleave
to his Wife?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tel.</speaker>
               <p>Without doubt.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Och.</speaker>
               <p>Do you not see how, in
saying, he shall cleave to his Wife,
(not, Wives) he teaches us, that a
man is to have but one?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tel.</speaker>
               <p>Very good, when God
commands a man to love his
Neighbour, does he oblige him
to love one or more?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Och.</speaker>
               <p>All that are his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tel.</speaker>
               <p>That's false; for he sayes,
Thou shalt love thy Neighbour,
not thy Neighbours; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
whoever loves one of his
Neighbours, has fulfilled that
Command.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Och.</speaker>
               <p>Christ, when he said, <hi>Thou
shalt love thy Neighbour,</hi> spoke it
in this sense, as if he should ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

said, Thou shalt love every one
that is thy Neighbour.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tel.</speaker>
               <p>So likewise <hi>Adam,</hi> when
he said: <hi>he shall cleave unto his
Wife,</hi> did intimate, that he should
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100063:17"/>
cleave unto every one that shall
be his Wife; And therefore <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>ã€ˆâ€¦ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>
not be proved by those wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>s,
that it is unlawful for a man to
have more Wives then one.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Och.</speaker>
               <p>But what will you say to
those following words of his: <hi>and
of them twain shall be made one
flesh?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 2.</note> for he does not say, of three
or four. From these words it is
doubtless manifest, that God
would not have Marriage to be
made between more then two.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tel.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adam</hi> sayes not, that of
them two shall be made one flesh;
but, <hi>they shall be made one Flesh.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Och.</speaker>
               <p>But that was his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as plainly appeares from the
words of Christ, who citing the
said speech, sayes, that God by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
declared,<note place="margin">Mat. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>And they two shall
be one Flesh,</hi> adding moreover, this
following clause: <hi>They are no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
two, but one Flesh.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tel.</speaker>
               <p>It is as if he had said, The
Husband shall love every one of
his Wives, as if she were the same
flesh, and the same body with
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100063:17"/>
him; and so likewise, shall every
Wife love her Husband.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Och.</speaker>
               <p>But God said, they two
shall be one: therefore there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be three or foure.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tel.</speaker>
               <p>You were in the right, if
he had said, They two (only) shall
be one. And therefore, as this
Argument is of no force; Christ
said,<note place="margin">Mat. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>If two of you on Earth shall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
about a thing, they shall obtain
what they aske:</hi> therefore if three
or foure shall agree they shall not
obtain the same: so is this no
good inference; God said, <hi>They
two shall be one Flesh:</hi> therefore
if there be three, it is no true Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Och.</speaker>
               <p>It is impossible for more
then two, to become one flesh.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tel.</speaker>
               <p>In the primitive Church,
there were not only two belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
but they were in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
having nevertheless one soul,
and one mind; and you believe,
if a man had divers Wives, he
could not become one flesh with
them. If a man, while he cleaves
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100063:18"/>
unto an Harlot, becomes as <hi>Paul</hi>
sayes, one body with her, although
he have a Wife, should he not
much more become one flesh
with her, if he should make her
his Wife?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Och.</speaker>
               <p>Say what you will; To have
more then one Wife, is a thing
filthy, dishonest, and quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
and destructive to the holy
State of Matrimony.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tel.</speaker>
               <p>And yet you know, that
<hi>Abraham</hi> had more Wives then
one; as also <hi>David,</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men under the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
who, in case it had been
unlawful for them, to have more
then one Wife, they should have
sinned in marrying divers Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
and the Children which
they had by all their Wives, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
the first; should have been
Bastards, because not begotten in
lawful Matrimony.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Och.</speaker>
               <p>I will sooner grant all that
you have said, then I will allow,
or grant it lawful for one man to
have more then one Wife. Those
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100063:18"/>
Ancients were holy men; yet
did they sometimes sin. They
were sinners, as being born of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
as appeares in the example
of <hi>David;</hi> and they should have
deceived themselves, if they had
denyed themselves to be sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tel.</speaker>
               <p>That they sometimes sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
I shall easily grant; but I will
never yield, that they continued
in their sins, till their day of
death: which nevertheless they
did, in case it was unlawful for
them to have divers Wives.
Whence it would follow, that
they were all damned, as those
who die while they keep a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubine.
As for us, we cannot hold
them for Saints, seeing we know
not for certain, that they ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented.
When <hi>David</hi> had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
those same Acts of Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and Murther, because he was
one of Gods Elect, God sent his
Prophet to him, to reprove him:
as also when he numbred the
People, contrary to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100063:19"/>
of God. Credible therefore
it is, that if to have divers Wives,
had been contrary to the Law of
God, God would have used the
like proceedings towards him,
that he might not be damned. But
though you read the whole Bible
over, you shall never finde, that
God has forbad the having of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Wives. And yet, if it had bin
a thing unlawful, <hi>Moses</hi> would
never have dissembled the matter.
Moreover, the Scriptures tell us,
that <hi>David</hi> was a man after Gods
own heart, and that he was obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
to all the Lords Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements,
all his life long, save in
the matter of <hi>Vriah.</hi> So that had
it been a sin to have divers Wives,
seeing that also had been suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
known, the Authour would
have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>cepted it, or he must
doubtless, make himself a lyar;
by saying, that <hi>David</hi> committed
only that sin of <hi>Homicide,</hi> under
which his Adultery is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended.
Again, how could that
be true, which God said to <hi>David,</hi>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:100063:19"/>
when blaming him for his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulness
he told him, that he
had given him many Wives?
which questionless, must have bin
all Whores, except the first, and
so it had not bin God, but the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
that gave them unto him.
Moreover, you shall finde, that
God made a Law, that if any man
had two Wives, the one beloved,
the other hated; and had by them
divers Children, the eldest of
which, was the son of the hated
Wife, it should not be allowed
the Father, to make the Sonne of
his beloved Wife his Heire. Now
it might fall out, that the beloved
Wife might be his first Wife, and
so it should come to passe, that
though the Husband had Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
by the latter, sooner then by
the first, yet they should be Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stards,
if your opinion be true, and
born of an Whore, and therefore
ought not to be Heires. It is
therefore clear by the word of
God, that all the Children are le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate,
though sprung from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100063:20"/>
wives by one and the same
Husband; and that therefore not
only the first, but the following
marriages are lawful, seeing God
did both approve and blesse them,
in those holy men the first Fathers
of the world.</p>

               <p>The first thing, which you
say follows from my opinion,
that all which died having many
wives should be damned. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer:
If they are dead not having
divorced all save their first wife;
or without repenting of their sin,
they are all damned. But as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them as are saved did repent
and put away all but their first
and lawful wife.</p>

               <p>It is not likely that it was

               <p>But we ought no longer

of their repentance.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Och.</speaker>
               <p>True, unlesse the word of
God assures us that they were
Saints: as we know (for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
sake) <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>
to be Saints, because Christ
said, that <hi>many should come from the

down with</hi> Abraham, Isaac <hi>and</hi> Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,
<hi>in the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
Now, I conceive, that as <hi>Moses</hi>
because of the hardness of their
hearts, suffered the Jews to put
away their wives without just
cause, so for the same cause he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
them to have sundry wives,
that is to say, he did not forbid or
hinder it, nor punish the same by
any Law enacted in his Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.
But it follows not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that they did not sin in Gods
sight, and that they did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100063:21"/>
punishment unlesse they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tel.</speaker>
               <p>That thing is permitted,
which is neither punished, nor
hindred, nor forbidden. Truly, I
will not say <hi>Moses</hi> sinned, if to
avoid a greater evil, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
with the hardness of the
Jewes hearts, he permitted them
to have divers wives; that is to
say, he did not punish or hinder
them. But if he permitted them
so as not to forbid them, I cannot
but say, he sinned. For <hi>Moses</hi> ought
to have expresly forbidden, that
any man should have more then
one wife: which because he has
not done, we must needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
that it is not a thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Och.</speaker>
               <p>The having of many wives,
was then (as it is now) so appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
filthy, dishonest, and viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
that it was needless for <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
to forbid the same.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>And was it not appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
that Adultery was a thing
filthy, dishonest, vicious? yea,
much more then the having of
many wives, and yet he expresly
forbad adultery. But in case it
had been unlawful to have many
wives, he ought to have forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
that, so much the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly,
by how much the unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulnesse
thereof, was lesse ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
then the unlawfulnesse of
Adultery was. Is it not a clear
case, that Homicide is unlawful,
and yet he forbids that. In a

            <sp>

               <p>It may be said, that God
might remit the transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
against the second Table, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he is above, not only all
Creatures, but his own Law: and
peradventure he might remit the

the death of Christ; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
be willing, that they
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100063:22"/>
might have more wives then one,
without sin. And so it comes to
pass, that those under the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament
that had many wives, did
not sin; and under that conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
God might give many
wives to <hi>David.</hi> Though it may
also be said, that he gave them to
him, that is, permitted him to
have them, in as much as he
neither hindred, nor punisht
him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tel.</speaker>
               <p>That it is unlawful to
keep more wives then one, if your
opinion be true, is clear from the
word of God, who said, <hi>that two
should be made one flesh;</hi> but that
God did so far remit of his Laws,
that men should not sin in having
more, does not appear in the word
of God; that opinion therefore
of yours, has no foundation.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Och.</speaker>
               <p>If you consider well, you
shall finde that <hi>Lamech</hi> a very
wicked man, was the first that had
two Wives. Other holy men
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100063:23"/>
that preceeded him, knowing the
will of God, had onely one a
piece.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tel.</speaker>
               <p>As if that <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi>
and <hi>Iacob,</hi> were not more holy
then those very men you speak of.
But, in the first place, I cannot
tell how you came to know that
<hi>Lamech</hi> was the first man that had
two wives, although he be the
first man whom the Scripture
mentions to have had two. But
as this is a vain Argument, The
Scripture no where mentions,
that <hi>Cain</hi> had more then one Son;
therefore, doubtlesse he had no
more: so, as vain is this which
follows: It is no where in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
recorded, that those men that
lived before <hi>Lamech,</hi> had more
wives then one: therefore none
of them had above one wife.
Moreover, where it is said, that
<hi>Lamech</hi> had two wives, it is not
charged upon him as a sin, but
seems rather to be set down as a
thing pleasing to God, that a man
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:100063:23"/>
should have more wives then one,
seeing by them he gave <hi>Lamech</hi>
such ingenious Sons, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the inventors of Arts, both
delightful and profitable. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can I see how you came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
that <hi>Lamech</hi> was so wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a man, as you talk of.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Och.</speaker>
               <p>God plagued him, by
suffering him to fall into the sins
of murther and desperation, only
because he had married two
wives.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tel.</speaker>
               <p>But I cannot see, either
that he was a murtherer or fell
into despair; neither does the
Scripture teach any such thing, if
it be rightly interpreted: Or if
the Scripture had intimated any
such thing, (which I do not grant)
yet does it not thereby appear,
that God suffered him so to slip,
because he had married two
wives.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Och.</speaker>
               <p>But we may conjecture,
that his having two wives dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100063:24"/>
God, seeing his murther is
presently after mentioned.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tel.</speaker>
               <p>In the first place, I have
already told you, that by the
words of that Text, if they be
rightly understood, there is no
signification made, that either he
was a man-slayer, or in despera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and if such a thing were
intimated, it does not therefore
follow, that his plurality of wives
was the cause thereof, or that God
was offended with him therefore;
inasmuch as presently upon the
mention of his two wives, he
commends their Sons, as if he
would give us to understand, that
he approves of plurality of wives.
Add hereunto, that nothing ought
to be affirmed or avouched in the
Church of God, as necessary to
salvation, if it cannot otherwise
be known, save by conjectures
only.</p>

               <p>You are in an errour if

profitable for reprehension, correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

the new Testament was not

               <p>You take that for granted
which you have not proved, <hi>viz.</hi>
That it is unlawful to have more
wives then one. Moreover, you
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100063:25"/>
are deceived, if you think, that it
is a bad thing to have one wife,
but worse to have two; For as
the Act matrimonial, in him that
has one wife, is a thing not in it
self evil, nor repugnant to those
actions, that are necessary to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation:
no more is it to have two
wives, provided a man have a call
from God to mary them, and be
moved, not by the impulse of the
flesh, but of the Spirit, that he
may have children, and bring
them up in the fear of God; his
wife likewise doing the same.
Whence it follows, that he may
be as perfect that has two wives,
as he that has but one or none.
Nor had <hi>Abraham,</hi> because he
had divers wives lesse Faith, Hope,
or Charity, then Priests, Monks, or
Friars that have none. Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
Chastity, is as well the gift of
God,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.</note> as that of a single State, For

God, some one way, some ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

               <p>In that place, the Apostle
exhorted the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
Life, and that for no other
cause, but that a married estate
has many incumbrances atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the same: in as much as
married people, being intangled
with worldly affairs, are not so
free to pray, and preach up and
down, and do good to others, as
single people are. Now, if so be
the having of one wife, do bring
so many impediments, any one
may soon conjecture, what the
having of divers wives will do.
And therefore to have more wives
then one is unlawful.</p>

               <p>Some do thus interpret
the mind of <hi>Paul,</hi> A Bishop is to
have but one wife, that is (say
they) one Church for his spiritual
Spouse.</p>

               <p>Many reasons shew that
to be a false opinion. First, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Christ only is the Spouse of
Souls and Bridegroome of his
Church. And if we that are mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
be his friends, we ought
with <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> as the friends
of Christ, the only true Spouse of
Souls, to send them to him their
Bridegroom: and not to draw
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100063:27"/>
them to our selves. The Churches
therefore of Christ are not the
Bishops Spouses. And if they
were, as the Husband is superiour
to his Wife, so should they be to
their respective Churches, against
which <hi>Paul</hi> writes to the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi>
where he sayes, <hi>We are not
Lords over your faith, or over you,
by reason of your Faith.</hi> The
Church therefore is not <hi>Pauls</hi>
Wife. I confess indeed, that one
Church is enough for one Pastor,
and he does no small matter, if he
can govern that well. In the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
times of Christianity, one
Church sometimes had divers Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors,
as appeares from the Epistle
to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> in which <hi>Paul</hi>
salutes the Bishops, which were
at <hi>Philippi:</hi> whereas now a dayes
one Bishop has many Churches.
Moreover, when <hi>Paul</hi> sayes. A Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
ought to have one Wife, he
speaks of the manners of him that
was fit to be a Bishop. But if he be
yet to be chosen, he is no Bishop;
and therefore has no Church as
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:100063:28"/>
yet, that might be called his wife.
Hereby also it is manifest,
that by Wife, he did not mean
Church, because presently almost
after those words, he makes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Children, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that he govern his Family
well, and have his Children sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to him, with all Reverence.
For if a man cannot govern his
own Family, how can he oversee
the Church of God? In that place

a second; for as much as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
sayes, that after the death of
the Husband, the wife is free, and

               <p>It is not therefore unlawful
to marry again. Why then should
<hi>Paul</hi> reject such Widows, as had
had more Husbands then one?
for it was possible that some Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
having had divers Husbands,
might be more holy and honest,
then they which had had but one.
Also it might fall out, that she
which had had divers Husbands,
might live but one year with
them: whereas the rest that had
never had more then one, might
have lived with him, thirty or
forty years. In such a case truly, I
cannot see why they should be
more worthy to be chosen then
she. I do therefore believe, that
the mind of <hi>Paul</hi> in that place
was this, that such Widows were
not to be chosen that had had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Husbands, that is to say, who
being divorced, had married a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain:
their former Husbands who
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:100063:30"/>
divorced them being yet alive. For
either they were divorced upon a
just ground, and then it was not
fit they should be chosen; or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
an unjust ground, and so the
Matrimony remained good, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
never bin violated and then
the divorced woman had sinned,
if she married to another. By
which meanes it came to passe,
that all women divorced were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous,
not only such as married
to other men; but such likewise
as abstained from Mariage, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
amongst the Gentiles, who
were not wont to divorce them;
save for some fault or vitious qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
<hi>Paul</hi> therefore did never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
those Women, who their
former Husband being dead mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
another, nor did he forbid
them to be Bishops, who their

have kept divers Wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:100063:30"/>
make him a Bishop; but if his
first Wife being dead, he marry
another, they will not: whence it
comes to passe, that Matrimony
amongst them is of worse report,
then Fornication, Adultery, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest,
Sacriledge, Sodomie, and all
imaginable abominations. This
is therefore the mind of <hi>Paul</hi> (and
this will make the third opinion)
as has bin said of Widows, that he
who has had divers Wives, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he divorced one<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to be made a Bishop. For if he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorc't
her unjustly, he ought not
to be a Bishop in that regard; if
justly, yet the Infamy of his wife,
redounding upon himself; for
that cause <hi>Paul</hi> would not have
him be a Bishop. Howbeit, I like
not this Opinion; for he does not
say, he must have bin, but that he
must be the Husband of one wife:
for he sayes, he must be unblamed,

that they should be married; and

be blameless, and to have a wise<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
but that they should have no
more then one, he did not say. Or
he shewes, that a Bishop ought to
have a wife, that is, he ought to be

            <sp>

               <p>The mind of <hi>Paul</hi> is this,
that it is lawful for the generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Christians, to have many
Wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>es; but for Bishops to have
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:100063:31"/>
only every man one, not because
it had bin a sin for them to have
more; but because the duty of
Bishops being to labour for the
salvation of others, he feared lest
multiplicity of Wives should be
a pul-back, and hinder them from
performing their Office, as they
ought to do. For this cause he
would have them to have but
one: nor is it therefore unlawful
for other men to have more. Yea
verily, while he forbids Bishops
and Deacons to have more then
one, he closely allowes it to other
men. Nor is it likely <hi>Paul</hi> would
have forbidd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>n Bishops to have
more Wives then one, had it not
bin the Custom of those times for
them to have more. It was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in the new Testament forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
to Bishops to have many
Wives, as it was in the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
forbidden to Kings; not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it was in it self unlawful,<note place="margin">Deut. 17.</note> but
lest Kings, whose Office was of
greatest consequence, being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted
by their Wives, should be
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:100063:32"/>
corrupted, as it happened to <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon;</hi>
for if <hi>Adam,</hi> when he had
but one, was notwithstanding
perverted by her, 'tis easie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture
what might happen to
Kings, if they should have many.
Yet do I believe nevertheless, that
as in the same place he forbad
Kings to have many Horses, that
is too great a multitude, least he
should put his trust in them, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then in God; for otherwise
they were allowed to have many
Horses; even so, they were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>
forbid to have many Wives, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>David</hi> a most holy man, had
many; but that they should not
have an immoderate multitude,
especially such as were Heathens,
and Worshippers of false Gods.
To return therefore to our busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
'tis not credible, that <hi>Paul</hi>
feared, lest <hi>Timothy</hi> should choose
for Bishops, such as were <hi>Gentile's</hi>
or <hi>Iewes,</hi> not baptized. There
were therefore in the Church of
Christ, and among the Christians,
such as had more wives then one.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:100063:32"/>
And because from among them a
Bishop was to be chosen: he
would not have him choose one
that had divers wives. But if to
keep more wives then one, had
bin contrary to the Law of God,
as you say it is, and the first Wife
only were right and true, the rest
Harlots: 'tis not credible, that
the Christians would have bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
any one that had plurality of
wives, unless he had put away all
saving his first. And if that had bin
the practise, it had bin in vain for
<hi>Paul</hi> to command, that he that
was to be chosen Bishop, should
be the Husband of one Wife,
seeing Christians out of the
number of whom the Bishop
was chosen, had but each of them
one a peece. But this I much mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
at, that many who have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
written and do believe,
that to have more Wives then
one, is repugnant to the divine
Law, both moral and natural, and
yet in expounding <hi>Paul,</hi> they say,
that he writing to <hi>Timothy,</hi> warns
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:100063:33"/>
him to take heed, that he choose
not a Bishop that had plurality of
wives; whence it follows, that
seeing Election was not to be
made of any out of the Church of
God, that there were in Gods
Church such as had more
wives then one; and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
counted it not unlawfu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

have more. Otherwise, if they
had counted it unlawful, as they
did not Baptize, or admit unto
the Lords Supper any man that
kept a Concubine, unless he would
forsake her: in like manner they
would not have Baptized, nor ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the Supper, nor suffer'd
amongst them such as had many
wives, unless they would divorce
all save the first.</p>

Whence it follows, That as a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

Body to his wife, he did not so

himself of all power to give
it to other wives also: which the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:100063:35"/>
wives knew well enough by the
publick custome then in force;
and thereunto the wives did si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
give consent, seeing their
husbands married them with this
condition being understood.
Their marriages therefore were
good and lawful.</p>

as <hi>Sarah</hi> did of old. And if she
would not approve thereof, this

were lawful for her husband to
marry another, contrary to her

after she is brought to bed,

sick, her husband may without

another wife; yea, though a
mans wife were sound, and fit for
generation, yet she ought to take
it in good part, if enjoying the
company of her husband at some

living Creatures, she leave it free
for him to enjoy the carnal ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaitance

               <p>And yet there are sick
Men, as well as sick women. Also
a woman is able to have to do
with more men, then a man can
with women. Whence it seems
more just, for one woman to have
divers husbands, or at least lesse
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:100063:36"/>
injust, then for a man to have
many wives.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tel.</speaker>
               <p>Nay rather, since Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
is chiefly ordained for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation
sake, and a man having
many wives, may in a short time
have many more children, then a
woman which has plurality of
husbands: it is more equitable,
that a man have many wives, then
that a woman have many hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands.
But the chief causes why
women may not have many hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands,
and yet men may have
many wives, are these. First of
all, because, if women should
have many husbands, there would
follow great disturbance and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
in the world. For seeing
no husband could certainly know
that his children are his own, he
might alwaies suspect, that they
were some other husbands rather
then his; and consequently he
would not bring them up, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
them, nor take such care
for them, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ow he does, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:100063:36"/>
they are his own, though born
of divers wives. Perhaps also
being unassured that they are his
own, he would not make them
his Heirs. Another cause, why
it is lawful for men to have many
wives, but not for women to have
many husbands, is this; The hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
is his wives Head, and has au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and command over her, as
being her Superiour; for which
cause he may have divers wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>es,
provided he can well rule and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
them all. Nor is it a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous,
but a comely thing for to
have many members in one Body,
though there he but one Head; but
if the Body should have many
Heads, it would be a monster: So
for one husband to have many
wives, is not mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>strous; but for one
wife to have many husbands, is
monstrous. And therefore, as there
would be dissention and discord,

               <p>Shall I make it clear and
manifest to you, that the having
more wives then one, is a thing
forbidden? Christ sayes, if any
man put away his wife, save for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery,
and shall marry another,
he commits adultery. But if a
man might have more wives then
one<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> he should not commit adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
as Christ sayes, whether he
put away his former wife, or no.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Tel.</speaker>
               <p>No man can expound those
words of Christ, better then Christ
himself, who in another place ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
the said words, sayes,
Whosoever shall put away his
wife, save for adultery, causes her
to commit adultery, that is to say,
he gives occasion to his wife, so
unjustly put away, to commit A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery.
For the wife being by
that meanes deprived of her true
Husband, cannot marry any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
her former Husband living;
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:100063:40"/>
but she shall commit adultery.
Christ does not therefore say, If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
man put away his wife, not for
adultery, and marries another, he
commits adultery; but that he
gives occasion to his repudiated
wife to commit adultery.</p>

               <speaker>Och.</speaker>
               <p>Both <hi>Matthew, Mark,</hi>

If any man put away his wife, and
marry another, he commits adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
that is to say, by marrying
that other. But if his intent was
to shew, that by unjustly putting
her away, he gave her occasion to
commit adultery; it had been suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to have said, If any one put
away his wife; not adding, <hi>and
marry another.</hi> Christ therefore by
those words of his in the fifth of
<hi>Matthew,</hi> did not intend to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
that passage, which is recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in the 19. Chapter of the said
Evangelist: only he said, If any
put away his wife, not for adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
he makes her to commit adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery.
But in the 19. of <hi>Mat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:100063:41"/>
he sayes another thing, <hi>viz.</hi> that if
he marry another in the same
kind, he commits Adu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tery, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the first was his wife, and he
ought not to have more then one.
Add hereunto, that the words of
Christ in his Sermon upon the
Mount, were uttered before those
were, by which he answered the
Pharises, when they asked him,
Whether a man for every cause
might put away his wife. Those
former words therefore cannot be
an Exposition of those were spoke
afterwards.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tel.</speaker>
               <p>Whether the latter words
were an Exposition of the former
or no; it satisfies me; that his
meaning is one and the same in
both places, <hi>viz.</hi> that if any man
put away his wife without just
cause, he occasions her to commit
Adultery. And as for those words,
which in the 19. Chapter, are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
over and above: Christ ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
them to shew, that a wife un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly
divorced, if she marry ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:100063:41"/>
man, commits adultery,
though at the same time her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Husband marry another wife,
seeing the first Matrimony is not
void; but remains in full force.
His meaning therefore is this; If
he put her away unjustly, though
he marry another, yet he gives her
that is put away, occasion to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
adultery.</p>

Women is greater, I conceive it
fit, that one man have many
Wives; for it is not in vain, that

there were in the World, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample

they could not so soon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate
their kind: as if of six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
four hundred were Women,
and two hundred men, every one
of which should have divers Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
For this cause therefore,
<hi>God</hi> ordained, that the number of

Och.</speaker>
               <p>In the first place, I do not
believe that you know there are
more Women in the World then
men. Perhaps it seemes so to you,
because commonly we rejoyce at
the birth of Boyes, and grieve at
the birth of Girles. But though
there be more Women born into
the World, yet they live not long
for the most part, by reason of the
more tender constitution of their
bodies. Add hereunto, that many
more men perish then women, by
Warres, Shipwrack, and the Sword
of justice: that reason therefore
does not prove <hi>Polygamy</hi> or plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of Wives. Moreover, the
love of carnal society, is a most vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent
passion: and if dishonest
love cannot endure a Rival, much
lesse can that which is honest?</p>

               <p>Holy love rather extends
to all, even our enemies.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Och.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iacob</hi> was an holy man,
and he loved barren <hi>Rachel,</hi> more
then fruitful <hi>Leah.</hi> So also <hi>Helka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:100063:43"/>
loved <hi>Hannah</hi> that was bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren,
more then <hi>Peninnah</hi> that was
fruitful. <hi>Solomon</hi> also said, that his
beloved was one. It is therefore
an hard thing, to share out a mans
love, amongst many Wives, which
notwithstanding, must be done in
<hi>Polygamy.</hi> When a man has but
one Wife, mutual love is better
preserved, then if he had more;
and if any falling out happen, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
is more easily made.
Where there are many Wives,
there are divers understandings,
divers Constitutions, Distractions
and Discords.</p>

               <p>If there were a call from
God, there would be his blessing.
<hi>Polygamy</hi> is no enemy to charity.
And therefore if any man should
have plurality of Wives, and love
were wanting between them, that
were not the fault of <hi>Polygamy,</hi>
but of the said Wives.</p>

               <p>If the filthy love of an
Harlot, is oftentimes the cause,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:100063:44"/>
that a man is content with her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
much more ought the holy

            <sp>
               <speaker>Tel.</speaker>
               <p>We see that filthy love is
more effectual in some persons,
then holy love is in others: as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
in like manner, superstition
produces more good works in

all which comes to passe,

            <sp>
               <speaker>Och.</speaker>
               <p>That plurality of Wives,
is a thing contrary to natural
Reason, hereby appears, in that
all Nations have alwayes abstain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
therefrom, as from a thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful.</p>

               <p>You know that the light
of nature, that is to say, the Law
which is imprinted in the hearts
of men, is the gift of God, and
that it is just, and that the Law of
<hi>Moses</hi> is not contrary thereunto,
but an explanation thereof For if
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:100063:44"/>
the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> were contrary
thereunto, God would be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to himself, seeing both proceed
from God, or rather, both are one
and the same Law. And therefore
if plurality of Wives, had bin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the judgement of right
Reason: neither would <hi>Moses</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
have dissembled the same;
neither would those most holy
Patriarchs have used the same<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> nor
would God have born with it.
God by <hi>Moses</hi> commanding the
<hi>Iewes,</hi> that when they came into
the borders of the Gentiles, they
should not imitate their vices,
would have named <hi>Polygamy,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
other vices, if it had bin
unlawful; and he would have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
the same by <hi>Moses,</hi> which
nevertheless, he did not do. We
no where read, that ever God
punished any man for having plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of Wives, nor that he ever
did by his Prophets, threaten such
as had many Wives. If you would
have the manners of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
to be your rule and law, you
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:100063:45"/>
shall finde amongst them much
wickedness. And whereas you
said, that all Nations abhorred
<hi>Polygamy,</hi> that is false, as appeares
by the <hi>Iewes.</hi> Also <hi>Chremes</hi> had

of the Roman Empire can have two

               <p>It is sufficient, that being
Emperors, they had power to
make Laws.</p>
               <p>It is to be observed, that in
their daies, the condition of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:100063:46"/>
in the Heathenish Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
was such, that any man
might put away his wife for light
and frivolous causes, and keep
Concubines without any shame.
Howbeit, they had neither the
name, nor authority of wives.
The Emperors therefore thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed,
not because they thought
Polygamy was unlawful, seeing
they allowed many lawful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines;
but they judged it fit,
that only the first should have the
title and authority of a wife, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
seeing they might Divorce
her, if she pleased them not.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Och.</speaker>
               <p>But we see that Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines
were forbidden by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
<hi>Constantine.</hi>

               <p>If you well weigh his
words, you will find that his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
was, that it should be unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for him that had a wife to
have Concubines; not that it was
wholly unlawful, but he might
not have them with him, that is,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:100063:47"/>
in his own House, where his wife
dwelt, <hi>viz,</hi> to avoid brawlings,
discords and countentions. But
out of his house, he might have as
many as he would, Moreover,
the Roman-Emperor <hi>Valentianus,</hi>
having the same Authority and
power, did not only permit such
as had wives to keep Concubines,
but many wives also at the same
time, in the same house, all dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifyed
by the same name and of
equal authority: and <hi>Valentia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
himself, at the same time had
divers wives; and therefore by
the Law of <hi>Valentianus,</hi> which was
afterwards made, the former Law
of <hi>Constantine</hi> was abrogated.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Och.</speaker>
               <p>But <hi>Justinian</hi> in his <hi>Code,</hi>

               <p>Yet that Law of his was,
doubtless, published, as appears
by the Histories. Add hereunto,
that besides <hi>Valentianus,</hi> it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent,
that <hi>Constantius</hi> also the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:100063:47"/>
Son of <hi>Constantine</hi> the great, had
many wives. <hi>Clotarius</hi> also King
of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Heribertus</hi> and <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pericus</hi>

Nor will I deny, that it is a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

That it is at this day a thing fit

for a man to prefer himself before

               <p>Though you read all the
Councels over, you shall never
finde <hi>Polygamy</hi> forbidden. Nor
can that be said to be the reason,
because they conceived, it was
forbidden in the holy Scriptures.
For, neither is it forbidden, as we
have showne already: and in the
17. Canon of the Apostles, it is
decreed, that a man having two
Wives, should be removed from
the Episcopal and Priestly Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and from all other Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Offices. But if the Authours
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:100063:50"/>
of those Canons, had seen that
<hi>Polygamy</hi> was repugnant to the
Scriptures, to charity, and the
common good of mankind; they
would have excommunicated
such as had two Wives<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> nor would
they only have kept them from
the Communion; but they would
have also punished them grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously.
But those Apostolical per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
as <hi>Paul</hi> had done before
them, did only forbid the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of the Church to have more
Wives then one, not as if it were
a thing repugnant to common

little and little, to turn aside from
the right way, so that many now
fell to account Marriage unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
they were not ashamed to
write, That a mans first Wife be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Marriage, to take another: touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

and <hi>Tertullian</hi> interpret that
saying of <hi>Paul</hi> and the Apostles,
as if his intent had been, that he
which had two Wives, though
one after another, might not be a
Minister in the Church of God: as
also he that married a Widow, or
a divorced Wife, which is obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

that many may by divine instinct,
be called thereunto. There are
many such Canons; especially,
concerning Matrimony, which
want amendment; nor are we
tyed by any Canons, but such as
have their foundation in the word
of God. The Fathers have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

sometimes swarving from the rule
of Gods word. Moreover, we ought
to believe, that <hi>Paul</hi> taught the
<hi>Ephesians</hi> (for examples sake) and
the rest of the Churches, all things
necessary to salvation, as himself
testifies; and yet he taught them
not, that any were to be tyed to

                  </gap>ment therefore, is of
no force; the Councel enacted
penalties for such as had two
wives; and therefore the second
was no true Marriage. Moreover,
though above a thousand years are
passed, since penalties were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
against such as had two
wives: yet is it not above four
hundred years, since that decree
was first received by the <hi>Italians,

but an humane constitution; and
the Bishops would have exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
against <hi>Valentianus,</hi> for his plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of wives; but that he had
the holy Scriptures on his side.
And notwithstanding, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
such as had more then
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:100063:52"/>
one wife, as <hi>Austin</hi> and <hi>Boniface</hi>
did, as persons that seemed over
indulgent to the flesh; they did
not therefore excommunicate
them, or reckon them for such as
could not be saved. <hi>Ambrose</hi> was
a very sharp Reprover of sin; yet
do we not any where read, that
he reproved <hi>Valentinianus,</hi> for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
two wives. Yea, and the said
<hi>Ambrose,</hi> reprehending <hi>Iustina</hi>
his second wife; for being an <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,</hi>
must have reproved her also
for being no true wife, but a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubine,
which notwithstanding he
did not do. It is likewise recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that <hi>Leo</hi> the fifth, when he
heard that a certain Bishop in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica</hi>
had two wives, he only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed,
that by reason of the words
of <hi>Paul,</hi> he should be degraded
from that honour; but not that
he should put away his second
wife, or be otherwise punished for

and twenty years after the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity

take care, that such as had many
wives, and all were dead save one,
might content themselves with
her alone, and marry no more. So
that he exhorts men to shun plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of Wives, just as he should
exhort them to embrace a single
life; which can be understood of
none, but such as are called by
God, to such a kind of life. The
true Ecclesiastical Canons, which
oblige us to their observance, are
such as have their foundation in
Gods word. But go to; read that
Epistle which <hi>Gregory</hi> the third of
that name, Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> wrote
to the foresaid <hi>Bonifacius,</hi> there
you shall find him write, to this
effect.</p>
               <p>If any Man have a Wife, which
by reason of some bodily infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
cannot afford her Husband
due benevolence, he shall do well
to abstain from her. But if he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
contain (for that is a gift of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:100063:53"/>
God not given to all) it is better,
that he should marry another
Wife, then burn; provided, he
allow his first Wife all necessary
maintenance. Than which, what
could be expressed more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly?</p>

               <p>All that you can say, though

               <p>In case a man is by God

               <p>The whole World has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
that plurality of Wives is
unlawful, nor can any man have
more then one Wife, without
giving the greatest offence imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
which all men ought to
shun. Moreover, it is the will of
God, that we obey our Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates;
and they are so far from
consenting to <hi>Polygamy,</hi> that they
will put him to death, that shall
have more then one wife.</p>

               <p>But not, if he have many

man being moved by divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct,
to marry divers Wives, and
it should be no sin so to do; if he
married them, it were a scandal
taken (as the Schools speak) and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:100063:54"/>
not given. Also he might, to avoid
scandal, marry his second Wife
privately.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Och.</speaker>
               <p>But such things are hardly
practicable; and if he should be
often seen in Company of his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Wife, men would take of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
as supposing her to be his
Concubine. I shall therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
exhort all men to avoid
<hi>Polygamy;</hi> and truly I exhort you
to do the same. The Papists them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
do vow to live single, and
shall we that are regenerate, spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
and Evangelical men, marry
more wives then one?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Tel.</speaker>
               <p>Just; And how honest, that
single life of theirs is, all the
World takes notice. The Law it
self condemns barren Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
so far is it from not condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
voluntary and barren single
life. Now I speak expresly, of such
as have not the gift of continen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
nor are called to a single life.
The <hi>Romans</hi> did punish such as
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:100063:55"/>
lived single, and rewarded those,
who by abundance of Children,
did augment the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth;
and <hi>Lycurgus</hi> also, and
<hi>Ulpianus</hi> decreed the same. Now
what more blessed a thing can
there be, then the preservation of
humane kinde? which would
wholly perish, were it not for
Marriage. A man cannot trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to posterity, a more honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
memorial of his name, then
by leaving behind him Children,
virtuously educated. And what
greater folly can be imagined,
then under a shew of holiness, to
shun holy Matrimony, as a thing
profane<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> which notwithstanding,
has bin ordained by God, is dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by nature, perswaded by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
confirmed by Christ, praised
by Authours, sacred and profane,
commended by the Lawes, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
by the consent of all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and whereunto we are invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Examples of good, and
holy men? What more barbarous
and inhumane, then to loath Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:100063:55"/>
the desire whereof is
implanted in us by nature? VVhat
more unthankful to the common
nature of the World and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
then not to beget Children,
as our Ancestors and Parents have
begotten us? For my part I make
account, that such men are mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers
of as many as they might
have begotten, in case they had
embraced Matrimony; unless per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure,
they are carried by a
Divine Impulse to live single.</p>
               <p>Questionless, it is a kind of
Man-slaughter, not only by Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments,
to cause abortion and
barrenness; but also, without ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

               <p>Dare you then say, that
Marriage, a thing so holy and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
may be dissolved by Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry?

               <speaker>Och.</speaker>
               <p>I for my part have said it,
&amp; will say it again, and stand to it:
&amp; that you may perceive the truth
of what I say, I will shew you the
reason of it. A woman in the
matrimoniall contract, gives up
the honest use of her Body to her
husband, promising that no man
while he lives shall have the use
thereof besides himself: and the
man does the like by his wife.
For this cause <hi>Paul</hi> saies, that <hi>the
wife has not power over her own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
but the husband:</hi> and likewise,
that <hi>the husband has not power over
his own body, but the wife.</hi> If
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100063:59"/>
therefore the wife break her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
and faith made to her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
as yours has done, having
given the use of her Body to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
contrary to her Covenant
made with you; in this case the
husband is free and disingaged,
so that he may grant the honest
use of his Body to another wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
joyned to him in Marriage.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mesch.</speaker>
               <p>When men in cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting,
do give or promise any
thing upon condition, there is no
question, but the condition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unperformed, the promise or
donation becomes invalid: But
if the Promise or Donation be
made without any condition, it
is alwaies valid, though one of the
parties break their faith. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
in Matrimony, an honest use
of the Body is promised, both by
the wife and husband, without
any manner of condition, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
That though the one falsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
his or her faith, yet is not the
other party freed from the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement.</p>

               <speaker>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:100063:60"/>
Och.</speaker>
               <p>Do you then think, that the
husband promises the use of his
Body to his wife perpetually,
without any condition, <hi>viz.</hi>
Though she shall behave her
self perfidiously towards her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mesch.</speaker>
               <p>Yes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Och.</speaker>
               <p>But in the matrimoniall
contract, doubtlesse, neither saies
to the other: I do for ever give
you the use of my Body, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
that you prove unfaithful
to me.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mesch.</speaker>
               <p>Nor is it thus said, I
give you the use of my Body, for
ever, upon this condition, That
you prove faithful to me. But
this, doubtless, ought to be the
mind of each of them, <hi>viz.</hi> to
give the other the use of his or her
Body for ever, whether he or she
shall prove faithful, or no?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Och.</speaker>
               <p>And how know you that,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100063:60"/>
I pray you? If it were necessary
that Marriage should be contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in such a sense, it ought to be so
expressed in the Contract, which
notwithstanding is not done.
And if it were so, that these words
should be used: I give thee the
use of my Body for ever, though
thou shouldest prove unfaithful to
me, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mesch.</speaker>
               <p>Therefore it is, that
no such expression is used, lest
one should give the other occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of breach of faith, and to think:
Although I shall break my troth
plighted, yet cannot he or she de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
me the use of his or her Body,
seeing it has been given me with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any condition. But they
ought doubtlesse, both of them to
be of that mind.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Och.</speaker>
               <p>But I believe there are

deny the use of their Body to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100063:61"/>
the party with whom they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,
though that party should
prove unfaithful. But, go to;
think you not, that it is lawful for
you, after you have taken her in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery,
to separate your self from
her for a time, and not to meddle
with her, but to deny her the use
of your Body; yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <sp>
               <speaker>Och.</speaker>
               <p>Yet, according to your

use of your Body without any

               <p>In the matrimoniall

grant the same, to another; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
my wife should carry her

Again, I gave the same upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
in as much as I gave it
with this Proviso, that she should
be faithful to me: otherwise, that
it should be in my power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
her thereof for a time; and
the self same, my wife promised to
me. And this ought to be enough
to preserve such as marry from
Adultery, besides other cause<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <sp>
               <speaker>Och.</speaker>
               <p>But this imagination of
yours is built and founded in the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100063:62"/>
Aire, and contrary both to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Scriptures and right Reason.
And that it is, in the first place,
contrary to the word of God, is
clearly seen from the words of
Christ,<note place="margin">Matth. 5,</note> who thus speakes, <hi>You
have heard how it is said, He that

you, he that shall put away his
wife (save in the case of Adultery)
causes her to commit Adultery:
and he that marries her that is put
away, commits Adultery.</hi> From
these words of Christ, it follows,
that if the wife be an adultress, the
marriage is dissol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ed; and the
Man may without sinne marry
another woman, which he could
not do, if he should put her away
for other causes besides Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mesch.</speaker>
               <p>But there is no menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this matter, in the Gospel
of <hi>Iohn.</hi>

Och.</speaker>
               <p>And what then I pray
you? Will you therefore deny
that those words were spoken by
Christ, and accuse the other Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists
for liars? Christ wrought
many miracles, which are not
written in the Gospel of <hi>John;</hi>
and did not Christ therefore work
the said miracles, because <hi>John</hi> has
made no mention of them? <hi>John</hi>
in his Gospel, did not write all
the miracles and workes that
Christ did, nor all the words
which he said; yet ought we not
a whit the lesse to believe, that
he did those miracles and workes,
and spake those words, of which
the other Evangelists have made
mention, than if they were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
written in the Gospel of
<hi>John.</hi>
               </p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Misch.</speaker>
               <p>But what will you an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to this, that it is by <hi>Mark</hi>
and <hi>Luke</hi> reported, that Christ
should say, <hi>If any man shall put
away his wife and marry another,
he is an Adulterer,</hi> without adding
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100063:63"/>
any exception of Adultery, or any
other thing.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Och.</speaker>
               <p>And what of all that?
Will you therefore say, that <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi>
added that exception touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the wives adultery, from his
own head.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mesch.</speaker>
               <p>Nay rather, Will you
say, that those other two Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists,
have so delivered in writing
the sentence of Christ, in a matter
of such moment, as to leave his
speech maimed, and detract from
his words?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Och.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Matthew</hi> relates, that
Christ said touching <hi>Iohn Baptist,
that among all born of women, none
was greater then he:</hi> And <hi>Luke,
that no Prophet had been grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then he.</hi> Now if Christ had
uttered those words twice, it
might be alledged, That at one
time he said <hi>a greater,</hi> and at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
time <hi>a greater Prophet.</hi> But
like it is, that he spake those
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100063:63"/>
words but once. And therefore
we must think, that eith<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>r <hi>Luke</hi>
added that word <hi>Prophet</hi> of his
own head: or, that <hi>Matthew</hi>
omitted the same. And because
it is more credible, that <hi>Matthew</hi>
omitted somewhat, then that
<hi>Luke</hi> should add any thing, we are
to believe that Christ said, there
had been no <hi>greater Prophet.</hi> Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
in this case we ought rather
to think, that those two Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists
omitted that exception
touching Adultery, then that
<hi>Matthew</hi> did add the same. So
that we must confesse, that it was
uttered by Christ. But, let us
suppose that Christ said it not, and
that <hi>Matthew</hi> added it; in such
a case, we must certainly confesse,
either that <hi>Matthew</hi> wrote by the
Instinct of Christ, as his Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Member; and that it
is therefore of as much authority,
as if Christ himself had said it: or
that <hi>Matthew</hi> added it of his
own head; and so all the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Evangelists falls to the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100063:64"/>
ground which were a great wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednesse
to say. And therefore, we
must confess, that those words are
true, as they are recorded by
<hi>Matthew.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mesch.</speaker>
               <p>That we may rightly
understand the holy Scriptures,
the circumstances are diligently
to be considered. <hi>Matthew</hi> wrote
his Gospel to the Jewes, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they were accustomed to
Divorce their wives at pleasure;
he gave allowance to them, as
men unperfect, to put away their
wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>es for Adultery. But <hi>Mark</hi>
and <hi>Luke,</hi> because they wrote to
the Greeks and Gentiles, who
were not wont upon such slight
terms, to put away their wives as
the Jewes were, they did not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
them to put them away. And
because we are sprung from the
Gentiles, it is unlawful for us to
put them away.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:100063:64"/>
Och.</speaker>
               <p>In the first place, How
you come to know that <hi>Matthew</hi>
wrote his Gospel in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> I
know not. But suppose it be so,
as some give out, it does not
therefore follow, that he wrote
only to the Jewes. If <hi>Matthew</hi>
when he wrote his Gospel, had
wrote an Epistle to the Jewes,
and that touching matters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
them alone, there were
somewhat in that you say. But he
in his Gospel relates the Nativity,
Life, Death, and Resurrection of
Christ, what he said, and did, and
suffered, for the profit and good,
not of the Jewes only, but of all
Mankinde. And therefore, as
Christ forbad it to all men, though
principally to the Jewes: even
so also <hi>Matthew</hi> wrote his Gospel
to all. Otherwise, we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse,
that the other Evangelists
also, wrote only to the Gentiles,
and not to the Jewes likewise.
Yea verily, and the Epistle which
<hi>Paul</hi> wrote unto the <hi>Romans<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
                  </hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it was not written concerning
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100063:65"/>
matters belonging to them alone,
both was and will be useful to the
whole world: Even so, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of each of the Evangelists,
is profitable for all men. Add
hereunto, that if what you have
said be true, it should be lawful
for Jewes being turned Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
to put away their wives for
Adultery; but not for the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles:<note place="margin">Eph. 2.</note>
and so Christ should not
have taken away the partition
wall through his flesh, nor aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
the enmity, even the
Law of Commandments contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in Ordinances, for to make
in himself o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>twain one new man,
so making peace; and that he
might reconcile both unto God
in one Body. Also, that should
be false which <hi>Paul</hi> writes, where
he saies,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.</note> that <hi>in Christ Iesus there
is neither Iew nor Gentile.</hi>

               <p>Know ye not that
Christ being at the wedding, did
make void the Marriage of the
Evangelist <hi>Iohn,</hi> who was the

up a resolution to follow Christ.
So also, the same Christ undoes the

verily, I cannot tell how you

that Christ was present at that

it is necessary to become a Monk

a man may be both an Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band

               <p>Marriage is such a band
as couples and binds men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men

by spiritual death. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he that becomes a <hi>Monk</hi> or

that the marriage of such an one
is dissolved, and that the woman

               <p>They likewise that are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,
are dead to the World, yea,
and buried with Christ, and yet
their Marriage is not dissolved:
because two persons may be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
together, the one of which
is dead to the World, and alive to

good and firm: yea, and suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
both the parties be dead unto

a thing naught and vitious, I
should then confe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>s, it could not
be practised by good Christians,
who are dead unto the World. But
Marriage is a thing so holy<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> that it
is not repugnant to Christian per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>tion,
and the same man may
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100063:67"/>
be both in the highest degree spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual;
and a married man never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless.
Nor do I truly believe,
that men are made dead to the
World, and alive to Christ, by
Monkery, more then by Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
But to return to the point
in hand, where as you have alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
that saying of Christ, which
forbids men to seperate whom
God has joyned together, <hi>viz.</hi> by
Marriage. I answer, If the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
be an Adulteress, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
put away by her Husband,
in such a case<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> the Marriage is not
dissolved by man, but by God;
whose pleasure it is, that for Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
it should be dissolved. And
therefore, as in every lawful Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
God is he that joynes us to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
so, whereever Marriage
is lawfully dissolved, God is he
that dissolves the same.</p>
               <p>And again, When Marriages
are unlawful, the Devil is the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,
and joyner of them; and he
it is that dissolves them, when
they are dissolved without just
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100063:68"/>
cause. Add hereunto, that seeing
by marriage, of two one flesh is
made; if either of them commits
Adultery, that party breaking
his or her plighted faith, by joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him or her self unto another,
and disjoyning him or her self,
from his or her respective Wife
or Husband, dissolves the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.
And therefore, if the Wife
have committed Adultery, and
for that cause her Husband mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
another: in such case the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
is not dissolved by the man,
though he marry another; but by
the woman, who by her Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
has disannulled the marriage.
Therefore Christ, when he forbids
Man to seperate, whom God has
joyned together: he does not only
declare, that a man ought not
without just cause, to put away
his wife; but also, that neither
of the parties should commit A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery,
because he or she that
commits adultery does for his, or
her part, dissolve the marriage.</p>

Mes.</speaker>
               <p>But you do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the mind of Christ, when he
denies that a man ought to put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
his wife, save for adultery. For
his intent is not, that a man by
his wives adultery, becomes so
free, that he may marry another
woman: his meaning being only
this, that a man in regard of his
wives adultery, may be so sepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from her, as to deny her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal
benevolence; the holy band
of matrimony, remaining never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
entire betwixt them.</p>

               <p>When the Jewes divor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
their wives, the matrimony
was dissolved, so that not only
they which divorced them, might
marry other women; but the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorced
wives might likewise be
married to other Husbands. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
it had bin needless for
God by <hi>Moses,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lev. 21.</note> to forbid Priests to
marry women that had bin di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorced,
in case such women had
not bin allowed to marry; and yet
God by <hi>Moses,</hi> forbad the Priests
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100063:69"/>
to marry women that had bin di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorced
from their Husbands.<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 19.</note>
Christ therefore speaks after this
manner. It has bin said, <hi>viz.</hi> by
<hi>Moses,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 24.</note> whosoever will put away
his wife<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> let him give her a Bill of
Divorce: namely, to the intent,
the Husband may not marry her
again; and that she may be free,
and in a capacity to marry to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
man; and that marriage of
hers may become firm and stable.
But I, sayes Christ, speaking after
another manner, do tell you,
whosoever does put away his wife
(that is to say, as the Jewes were
wont to put away theirs, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
given them a Bill of divorce,
were freed and inabled to marry
others) he is an adu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>terer. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
it is lawful for a man to put
away his wife, and marry another,
only in case his wife be an Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teress.
Marriage may therefore,
according to the Doctrine of
Christ, be dissolved for Adultery,
in such manner as the Jews were
wont, for every cause to dissolve
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:100063:69"/>
their Marriages, not only so, as
that they should not have to do
one with another, in a conjugal
way; but also that each party
should be so free, as they might
marry with any other. Neither
indeed, is it a true divorce, unless
the Matrimony be dissolved: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
were the Jews acquainted
with any other kind of divorcing,
or putting away of wives, saving
that which did abrogate and nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie
the marriage, and of such a
putting away, or divorcing it was
which Christ spake, which is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
from these words by him
subjoyned:<note place="margin">Mat. 19.</note> If the Husband (save
in the case of his wives commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Adultery) does put her away,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>nd marry another, he commits
adultery. Therefore if he put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>away
his wife for adultery, and
marry another, he does not, in so
doing, commit adultery. VVe
must therefore from the words of
Christ, be forced to confess, that
the marriage is made void, by the
wives adultery; seeing it is in this
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100063:70"/>
case lawful for a man to marry
another. And that you may clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
see, that Christ there speaks,
only of such a divorce, as disan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuls
the marriage, do but consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
how the Pharises tempting
him, and asking him, if for every
cause a man may put away, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce
his wife, <hi>viz.</hi> in such wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>e as
the Jews did, by dissolving the
matrimonial Contract; he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
them, that it is not lawful,
save for adultery. Marriage is
therefore dissolved by adultery, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
the answer of Christ were
impertinent. Nor shall I stand to
say, that if Christ by the terme of
divorcing, or putting away, had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
only an abstinence from
conjugal embracements, so as
that the marriage was neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
to continue firm, that Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
had contained in it matter of
untruths: for it is all one, as if he
had said, a man may divorce his
wife onely for adultery. Now,
that it should be unlawful for a
man, so to put away his wife, as to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100063:70"/>
stain from her bed, save in case of
adultery, is false: for it is clear, a
man may lawfully do that for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
causes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mes.</speaker>
               <p>Let us suppose, and take
for granted, that Christ by the
termes of putting away and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce,
did intend the abrogation
and dissolution of marriage, yet
shall you never be able to make it
appear, that a man by reason of
his wives adultery, may marry
another: the cause whereof is
this. The speech of Christ has two
members, each of which is true,
and the first member is this: who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
puts away his wife save for
adultery<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> he makes her commit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery,
that is, gives her occasion
of so doing, because he puts her
away, not being an Adulterss. For
if he should put her away, being
an Adulteress, he should not give
her occasion of adulterating, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
she was adulterated before.
The other member is likewise
true, being rightly understood,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:100063:71"/>
that is to say, without any excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>viz.</hi> after this manner
whosoever marries her that is put
away <hi>(v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>z.</hi> unjustly) commits
Adultery. You see how the truth
of Christ his Speech stands firm;
nor can we conclude from his
words thus understood, That
Marriage is abrogated and nulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by Adultery.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Och.</speaker>
               <p>According to your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
therefore, Christ intimates,
That if any man puts away his
wife, not being an Adult<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>esse, he
gives her occasion to commit
Adultery, unlesse she were adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
before. For, in such a case,
seeing she is already adulterated,
she cannot be made an Adultress.
Now, if this be the mind of Christ,
What great matter has he taught
us? For who knows not, That he
which puts away his wife, being
already an Adultresse, does not
give her occasion to commit her
first Adultery, because the same
has bin already by her commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted?
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100063:71"/>
It seems you have so low
an opinion of Christ, as to believe
that he should utter so frivolous a
speech. Though an Husband, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorcing
his adulterous wife, does
not give her occasion to commit
her first Adultery; yet, question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
if it be unlawful for him to
put her away for Adultery<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and if
the marriage be not thereby
dissolved, he that puts her
away, gives her occasion to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
new adulteries; from which
to terrifie us, Christ would doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
have said, That she ought not
to be put away for any cause, no,
not though she should have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
Adultery: for as much as,
even thereby, the Marriage could
not be dissolved. It is therefore
clear, that, as to the first member
of the speech, this is the mind of
Christ; If an husband put away
his wife, only because she is an
Adultresse, he gives her no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to commit Adultery, because
that she marrying upon these
tearms, the former marriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:100063:72"/>
dissolved, does not commit
Adultery, but becomes the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
wife of her latter husband;
the marriage which she had made
with her former husband, being
by her adultery dissolved. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
likewise it is, that those
words of exception used by
Christ, are likewise to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ted
to the second member
of the speech, so that the sense of
Christ in that member may be
this; that if any man marry her
that is put away, he commits
Adultery, unlesse she were put
away for Adultery. And that this
is the intent of Christ, is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
not only from the tenor of
his words, but also much more
from what he faies in another
place, explaining the said words.
<hi>Whosoever,</hi> quoth he, <hi>puts away his
wife,<note place="margin">Matt. 19</note> save for Adultery, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
another, commits Adultery.</hi>
And so does he that marries her
that is put away. Here it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly
apparent, that the excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is to be accommodated to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100063:72"/>
each member of the speech, and
that the meaning thereof is this,
That he sins not, who having di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorced
his wife for Adultery mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
another: and that he likewise
does not sin, who marries her that
has been divorced, or put away
for Adultery.</p>

to her husband; And
then without any manner of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
he adds this following
speech, And let not the husband
put away his wife. And therefore
it is unlawful for a man to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce
his wife for Adultery:</p>

               <p>Do you believe, that it is
<hi>Pauls</hi> meaning, that it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for a man upon any occasion
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:100063:73"/>
whatsoever, to put away his wife
and marry another, no not for
Adultery?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mesch.</speaker>
               <p>I believe it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Och.</speaker>
               <p>But I have shewn already,
That the sentence and judgment
of Christ is, That a man may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
put away his wife for Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
and marry another. How
can it therefore be, that <hi>Paul</hi>
should faithfully declare the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of Christ, as he saies of
himself that he did, if his mind
was, to speak contrary to what
had been said by Christ, <hi>viz.</hi> That
a man ought not to Divorce his
wife, no not for Adultery?
For, if this be his sense, certainly
<hi>Paul</hi> was no faithful Messenger of
Christ. And therefore, if we will
grant, That <hi>Paul</hi> faithfully deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
the mind of Christ, we must
confesse, that by him Adultery
was excepted as well as by Christ,
although <hi>Paul</hi> did not in words
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:100063:73"/>
expresse so much. For this cause,
<hi>Ambrose</hi> conceived, that in the
words of <hi>Paul</hi> the exception of
adultery must be understood, left
<hi>Paul</hi> should be contrary to Christ.
Add hereunto, That seeing <hi>Paul</hi>
in this place, exhorts to reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation;
it is clear, that he speaks
not of Adultery, but of other
smaller injuries, for which the
<hi>Greeks</hi> were wont to make Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce,
and which might easily be
reconciled; for which kind of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries,
<hi>Paul</hi> would not by any
means have married people to
Divorce. It may likewise be said,
That although the mind of Christ,
is, That he who puts away his
wife that has committed adultery,
and marries another, is not an
Adulterer, because in such a case,
the second Matrimony is good
and valid, as the first was; yet he
did not think it was alwaies
rightly done, and that Husbands
of Adulterous wives, ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
to Divorce them and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:100063:74"/>
others. But rather that it may
sometimes so happen, that the
wife being an Adulteress, her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
may neverthelesse sin, if he
put her away and take another.
For in case a Wife have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
adultery, and the Husband be
so minded, as to judge that it
makes more for the Glory of
God, not to put her away and
to take another, than the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
supposing it probable, That
if he take the Adulteress again, she
will be reclaimed; but if he put
her quite away, she will grow
worse: he ought not to Divorce
her; and if he marry another, he
sins: not because the second is
no true marriage, but because in
refusing and divoreing her, and
marrying another, he hath sinned
against Charity and his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.
And because 'tis likely,
that many times 'tis the best way,
not to Divorce them, <hi>Paul</hi> gave
order in the name of Christ, That
they should not be divorced, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:100063:74"/>
they did commit adultery,
in case the husbands believe, that
it will make more for the Glory
of God not to Divorce them.
But if the husband judge, That
in case he be reconciled to her,
both she and other wives, by her
example, will become more inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and depraved, to the great
dishonour of God; he ought to
put her away by Divorce.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> in another place
saies, That the wife is bound to
her husband by the Law so long as
he lives, so that if she marry ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
man, she becomes an Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresse:
which holds not, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
dead; for then, being freed by
the death of her husband, she is
by the Law allowed to marry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.
And therefore a Wife
cannot so long as her Husband
lives, any waies be freed from the
band of Matrimony, and marry

               <p>They which hold it lawful
for a man, because of his wives
adultery<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> to marry another, do
not therefore think it lawful for a
woman by reason of her husbands
adultery to marry another man.
I may therefore grant you that
which <hi>Paul</hi> writes, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is
in no wise lawful for the wife du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
her husbands life, to marry
another, though her husband be
an Adulterer. But it does not
therefore follow, that the husband
cannot Divorce his adulterous
wife, and marry another. And
therefore, though the husband
has power to put away his wife,
having played the Adulteress, yet
has not the woman the same
power, to Divorce her husband,
in case he prove an Adulterer, and
marry another man.</p>

Och.</speaker>
               <p>The very words of Christ,
who saies expresly, That it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for a man to put away his wife
for adultery: but that it should
be lawful for a woman to put
away or refuse her husband for
adultery, he has not said. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did ever <hi>Moses</hi> speak so much
as one word of the divorcing of
men. They add also this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
because the husband is
Head of his wife, and has autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
over her, he may upon the
occasion aforesaid, put her away:
which the wife cannot do to the
husband, as having no such autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>

               <p>If Marriage be dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by adultery, so that of two,
there is no longer one flesh made,
as there was by Matrimony; see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the husbands adultery is as
much adultery, as the wives, I
admire that Marriage is abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and dissolved by the womans

likewise.</p>

Och.</speaker>
               <p>Marriage is not so dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by adultery, that as soon as
the adultery is committed, the
band of Matrimony is loosed and
broken a sunder; so that, neither
the woman is any longer his true
wife, nor the man her true hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.
For, supposing the case to
be so, it were necessary that they
should be married again, to the
end they might enjoy one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in a conjugal way, without
sin. And therefore the Marriage
is not dissolved by the Act of
Adultery; but by the womans
Adultery it comes to passe, that
the Man has power to Divorce
her, and she being divorced, the
Matrimony is dissolved, which
does not so come to passe by the
mans Adultery: for as much as
the wife does not, thereby acquire
any power to put away her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
or Divorce her self from
him.</p>

               <p>Nay, but a wife may

so much, nor the Jewes ever

               <p>I will give you another an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to the words of <hi>Paul,</hi> and say,
That it is not necessary that Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes
&amp; Comparisons should in
all points agree; but it is enough
if they agree in that particular
for which they are brought, As
when Christ saies to his Apostles,
<hi>I am the Vine, ye are the Branches,</hi>
his meaning is by that similitude
to declare, That as the Vine-bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
cannot bear fruit without
the Vine, neither can they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Christ; and if in that point
the similitude hold<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> it is enough.
But he does not likewise intimate
this, That as the branches of the
Vine bear fruit only once a year:
so they should bring forth the
fruits of righteousnesse only once
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:100063:77"/>
a year. So <hi>Paul</hi> in the place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

stood in need of the Law; and
brings the Example of a woman,
who may lawfully marry againe,
her husband being dead. It is
therefore sufficient, if in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
the comparison hold (as it
doth) That as by the death of
her husband, a wife is freed from
the Law of Marriage, so that she
may be married to another man;
even so we, by the death of the
carnal man are made free from
the Law of <hi>Moses;</hi> seeing that
we now operate, not by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand

of the Spirit, and are no longer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

               <p>I answer, In that place,
the saying of <hi>Paul</hi> runs thus; I
speak to such as know, the Law,
<hi>viz.</hi> the Jewes that are already
baptized, who know the Law al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
a man to put away his wife,
by giving her a Bill of Divorce:
by which means she being freed
may marry another man. This
therefore was the mind of <hi>Paul,</hi>
that she might not marry another
during her husbands life, unlesse
she be first divorced from him;
and therefore during her husbands
life, it is not in her power to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,

is not in her, but in her husband.

               <p>As God allowed the
Jews by reason of their imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
and to give a little way
to the hardness of their hearts, to
Divorce their wives when they
pleased<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> so we must needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse,
that he has denied this liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

            <sp>
               <speaker>Och.</speaker>
               <p>This indeed is manifest;
Unlesse sin had been in the world,
there would never have been any
Divorce: and unto Christians,
who ought to be perfect, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce
may be in such a sense said
to be forbidden, in as much as
Adultery is forbidden. But if a
woman be an Adulteress, her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
is allowed to put her away,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:100063:78"/>
and to marry another. Even as, if
there had never been any sin,
Parents would never have cast off,
or renounced and disinherited
their children; and Christians, as
those that should be perfect, are so
far forbidden to renounce their
children, for as much as those cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
are forbidden, for which they
may justly renounce them: But if
children be such, that their Pa-Parents
may justly renounce
them, it is allowed to Parents,
both to renounce them, and to
adopt others in their stead.</p>

               <p>There can be no just

            <sp>
               <speaker>Och.</speaker>
               <p>Christ, it seems, was not
aware of those so great inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences,
which Divorce, as you
say, brings along with it: or you
are more careful to preserve san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity
then Christ was. If Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce
drew so many inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
after it as you say, we ought
to confesse, that Christ did ill
who allowed a man to practise it,
by reason of his wives adultery.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mesch.</speaker>
               <p>If Christ did permit
it, he permitted it only as an evil
thing.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Och.</speaker>
               <p>That he permitted it to
a man, in case of his wives adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
is apparent out of his words,
which we have formerly heard.
But whether he did well or ill
in permitting the same, that is a
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:100063:79"/>
thing, truly, which I would learn
of you. Nor do I take you to be
so shameless as to say, that he did
not well in permitting the same.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mesch.</speaker>
               <p>He did well to permit
it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Och.</speaker>
               <p>If he did well to permit
it for adultery, it follows, That
they do not well, and are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to Christ, who deny the same,
though a mans wife be an Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tress.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mesch.</speaker>
               <p>They do it to a good
intent, that those inconveniences
may be avoided, which are wont
to spring from Divorces.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Och.</speaker>
               <p>If greater inconveniences
arise from the allowance, then
from the forbidding of Divorce,
Christ did ill to permit the same:
and they have done well that have
forbidden it. But because it were
wickedness to say, That Christ did
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:100063:80"/>
ill to permit it, we must confesse,
that they have erred, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad
it, and that greater incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences
arise from denying,
then from permitting the same.
Therefore it is rightly permitted
by Christ; seeing of two evils, if
one must be chosen, we ought to
choose the least. But, let us take
this course; do you reckon up the
inconveniences, which arise from
divorcing wives for Adultery; and
I will recount such as spring from
forbidding to Divorce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> them:
which evils, being afterwards put
into the ballance, one against
another, we shall see which are
the greater.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mesch.</speaker>
               <p>I am content. And in
the first place: If it were lawful
for men to put away their wives
for Adultery, seeing the number
of unchast women is great, there
would be a world of divorces,
from whence infinite inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
would arise.</p>

               <speaker>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:100063:80"/>
Och.</speaker>
               <p>In the first place, I believe
there are many chast women; and
if some prove unchast, I am sure
there will be the fewer, if they
shall know they may be divorced
for adultery, and shall suffer the
just penalties thereof. Add here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
That I do not say, that a
man may put away his Wife for
every suspition: no, not if he shall
see her play the Adulteresse, with
his own eyes: but only, if he shall
convict her of adultery, before
Judges appointed to hear such
cases. Nor is the Husband in such
case bound to put her away: nay,
but it is lawful for him not only
not to put her away in such a case,
but to be reconciled to her. Yea,
and he is bound to do it, if for
some cause (which may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
happen) he shall fore-see,
that it will be more for the Glory
of God, to be reconciled. I add
this also, Although the woman
be convicted of adultery, yet is it
not lawful for the man to Divorce
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:100063:81"/>
her, and to marry another, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Magistrates consent, who
may sometimes determine, that
he shall not Divorce her: as if, for
example sake, he fears lest if he
should Divorce her, the womans
Parents should raise great tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults,
and there should be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of much blood-shed. And
therefore, there would not be in
this case so many Divorces, as you
have intimated.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mesch.</speaker>

                  </gap>d not suffer her to be
divorced by her Husband, he
should then, according to your
judgement, go contrary to Christ:
and therefore the Husband ought
not to obey him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Och.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, but he ought: for
he should not go contrary to
Christ. For Christ does not <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,</hi>
that a man <hi>should</hi> put away
his wife for adultery: he only
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:100063:81"/>
                  <hi>grants</hi> that he <hi>may</hi> do it. And
the man ought doubtlesse to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce
her, if <hi>that</hi> shall tend more
to the Glory of God. But if
to Divorce be more dishonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to God, then not to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce,
as it is in that Case by me
propounded, he ought not to
Divorce her. The Magistrate
therefore, is no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> therein contrary
to Christ, but agrees with him;
and the Husband ought to obey

they not to obey the Pope, who
would have them put away for no
cause, no not for adultery; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
that Precept of his
be unjust?</p>

Och.</speaker>
               <p>In such a case as I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,
the Magistrate ought to
be obeyed and not the Pope;
and that for this Reason. The au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
which Magistrates have,
is not contrary to Christ, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to the will of God:
and therefore they ought not by
refractorinesse to be contemned,
but to be honoured by Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
But the authority of the
Pope, is point blank contrary to
the Authority of Christ; &amp; ought
therefore to be contemned and
opposed. And, that this is so,
I thus demonstrate. The godly
and Christian Magistrate, has a
power of taking cognizance, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
women accused of adultery,
are indeed and in truth Adulteres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
or not. And, in case they
shall be lawfully convict of adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
they have the power of
judging, by sundry circumstances,
whether it is best they should be
divorced, or not. And, in case
they may sometimes erre in their
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:100063:83"/>
Judgement, their authority is
not therefore contrary to Christ,
as the Popes is; for their business
is not to hinder all Divorces, but
providently to consider, when
they may be allowed<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> or not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed;
being well assured, that
it may often so fall out, that
they may be lawful and fitting.
But the Popes work is, to prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
all Divorces, as if to Divorce
were never lawful, contrary to
the Doctrine of Christ, who
taught<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> That a Wife may lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be divorced for adultery; It is
therefore fit in this cas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn
the authority of the Pope,
as pernicious and contrary to
Christ: and on the otherside, to
honour the authority of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,
and obey the same, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
useful in it self, and agreeable
to the mind of Christ, though
they may sometimes abuse the
same. But to return to our mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in hand, Do you go on to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
the inconveniences which
altered Divorce.</p>

               <p>When women are not

will commit adulteries that their

               <speaker>Och.</speaker>
               <p>But this would very sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
happen: In the first place,
because they would understand,
that possibly they might not be
divorced, though they should
prove Adulteresses: Again, because
although they were divorced, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
made infamous, hardly any
men would marry them. Add
hereunto, That if just Lawes were
in force, they should be put to
death, or be at least so punished, as
it would be impossible for them
to marry.</p>

               <p>If a Man might put
away his Wife for adultery, and
marry another, his marrying ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wife would shew, that he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorced
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:100063:84"/>
the former, not so much
because offended with her adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
as because he was allured by
love of the second.</p>

               <p>Holy men can do nothing
so uprightly, but that wicked
persons may at least calumniate
their intentions; yet ought they
neverthelesse, to persist in that
which is right. If Divorce
should be exercised for adultery,
according to Gods word, when
ever it were done, by order of the
Magistrate, it would give occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of offence to no Man. And,
if so be neverthelesse, some wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
person should by such Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce,
take offence where none
was given; it were not therefore
just to compel the innocent Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
to hold society with so
wicked a Woman, to his great
disgrace and infamy, as in such
a case would happen: or to live
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:100063:85"/>
single all his life after, whether
he were endued with the gift of
Continence or not. But, go to;
consider with your self, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
inconveniences have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
arisen upon this ground, <hi>viz,</hi>
because it has been wholly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
to Divorce for Adultery.
In the first place, Many men have
killed their Wives whom they
have taken in Adultery, that
they might free themselves from
so shamelesse a companion, and
have by that means liberty to
marry another: which they
would not have done, if
they might have been allowed
to Divorce them. Moreover;
many Husbands, offended by
their Wives Adultery, and loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to hold society with them,
have given them Poyson privat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
or have run away from them:
and many times the Wives
themselves for fear of death, have
abstained from the society of
their Husbands in such cases:
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:100063:85"/>
and wanting peradventure the
virtue of Continency, have
committed innumerable crimes:
which they had not done, if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
made each of them free by
Divorce, they might have joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
themselves to some other
in Marriage. And these were
the fruits of (Sir reverence)
those holy Interdictions of the
Pope, forbidding Divorce for
Adultery, and License to the
divorced to marry again.</p>

               <p>As Christ sticks close to his

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:100063:86"/>
she brake her Covenant

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mesch.</speaker>
               <p>But all men know, when they
marry Wives, that they cannot
Divorce them, although they
should prove Adulteresses: and
they marry them with such a
mind as not to Divorce them:
Whence it follows, That it is not
lawful for them to Divorce them.</p>

               <p>Seeing it is false, That they
may not be divorced for Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and that which is false cannot
be known, it follows, That Men
when they marry, do not know
that their Wives may in no case
be divorced. They had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
such a false perswasion: but
their Error being removed, they
may lawfully and honestly Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce
them, though, through er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous

               <p>You can never reckon up all

               <p>Truly you reason most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently!
just as if you should say;
You shall never be able to reckon
up all the Causes for which men
ought to be punished: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
'tis the best way to forbid all
punishment of wicked men. But
I, for my part, in the first place,
do assuredly know from the words
of Christ, That a Wife may be
divorced for Adultery. I know
likewise, that Magistrates may,
and ought to put in execution
these Divorces for Adultery, so
oft as they see, it may make to the
Glory of God. I know also, that
Divorce may be made for infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
because <hi>Paul</hi> has so said.</p>
