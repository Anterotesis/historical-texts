            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Reverend and Learned CLERGY, who have left their Cures in this time of Calamity:</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIRS,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHat the ſad Effects of your Flight have been is too too evident to thoſe, who only unite to make a breach in the Church, never expreſſing ſuch mirth as when they ſee the Church in mourning; To theſe it hath afforded matter of Contempt, not only of your Perſons, but alſo of your Office: To others, who are the true Sons of the Church it hath been no ſmall cauſe of fear and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I heartily wiſh you had ſtopt the mouths of the firſt, however I beg of you that you will ſatisfie the doubts of the ſecond, whoſe grief I have experienced to be ſuch, that none can heal them, but you that have given the wound: I have a long time expected what is here requeſted, but finding a fruſtration of my Hopes, and an increaſe of the peoples feares, I do by theſe in all humility requeſt you, and if that will not move, I challenge you faithfully to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the cauſe of your flight, whether ſenſe of duty, or fear of danger; If you anſwer the firſt, then tell me what Text in the Sacred Page commands it: <hi>Is this to abide in your Calling whereunto you were called? Is this to ſtand upon your Watch? Is this to gird our ſelves, lament and howle,</hi> &amp;c. as the Prophet <hi>Joel</hi> commands, <hi>chap.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 13, 14. <hi>Is this to be ready to die for the Cauſe of Christ,</hi> with Saint <hi>Paul; Or to comfort the feeble-minded, and to ſupport the weak,</hi> as he enjoines, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 14. No, no, it cannot be. 2. Which of the Fathers have either taught or practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it: Is not this contrary to the doctrine of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers both ancient and modern, St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> comparing <hi>Mat.</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:33715:3"/>
10. 23. with <hi>Job.</hi> 10. 12. concludes, that though in ſome ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Flight may be lawful, yet ſaith he, <hi>Quando commune eſt periculum fugiendum non est, ne quiſquam fugere credatur non conſulendi voluntate, ſed timore moriendi magisque fugiendi obſit exemplo quam vivendi proſit officio</hi> epiſt. 180. In a common danger we ought not to flie, leſt we ſeem to flie rather for feare of death, then love to live to the good of the Church, and ſo become more hurtful by our example in flying, then we can be profitable by our living. Nay, further, he tells us, <q>If the Calamity be ſo great, that we muſt either all of us flie or die, that its then to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by lot, and we ought to take our lot: </q> Semblable to this are thoſe words of that learned and religious Prelat, once Biſhop of <hi>Exceter, Decad.</hi> 4. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 9. <q>We, ſaith he, are not our own but our peoples, and are charged with all their ſouls, which to hazard by abſence, is to loſe our own:</q>  We muſt love our lives, but not when they are Rivals with our ſouls, or with others; Its better to be dead then to be negligent or faithleſs: All ſoules muſt not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully be neglected becauſe ſome are contagiouſly ſick: this is the time when good counſel is moſt ſeaſonable and needful; now then, to run away from a neceſſary and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good to avoid a doubtful and private evil, is to run into a worſe evil then we would avoid. <hi>I</hi> will not trouble you any further, by inſtancing in the doctrines and practices of others of the Fathers; <hi>I</hi> know its needleſs: Only one more, and that is the practice of your ſpiritual Father, his Grace the Lord Arch biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who ventures his perſon with us in this common calamity, whom God preſerve in health and honour; Had you troad the ſteps of this holy Father, how might you have refreſhed your
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:33715:3"/>
afflicted flock, and ſtopt the mouths of all thoſe who watch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for your halting. I have hinted the example and practice of this pious and learned Prelat, not that <hi>I</hi> judg it leſs unlawful for a Biſhop to remove his Seat, then for any of us to remove from one part of our pariſh to another, (which in truth is ſo far from being unlawful, that in ſome caſes <hi>I</hi> judge it our duty to do it) But <hi>I</hi> have thus inſtanced for the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my fellow-Labourers in the work of the Miniſtry, ſeeing he hath denied himſelf his own convenience for our comfort. The <hi>Romans</hi> that Fled with <hi>Pompey,</hi> termed their baniſhment better then their own Countrey, becauſe <hi>Pompey</hi> was with them: what encouragement then may it be to us that we have our Father with us. 2. To the ſhame of ſom of you that are Fled, notwithſtanding the large taſte you have had of his kindneſſe, in 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 19. 37<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in ſtead of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in the Original we finde the Vowels ſet in the Text without their Conſonants; To intimate, that for the Kings own ſons to lay violent hands upon their father in the Temple, at his devotion, though it was to a falſ god, was <hi>ſcelus infandum</hi> a wickedneſs too monſtrous to be expreſt; If theſe were not worthy to have their Names written in the Book of God, becauſe they had ſlain their father, who was a Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipper of a falſe god, then what is due to you to leave your Father, who even in this time of danger, not only by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, but example, teacheth the Worſhip of the true God. 3. Pray tell me if it be your duty to Fly, who have <hi>Curam Animarum</hi> upon you; how then is it lawful for your Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates to ſtay, nay, is it not a ſin in you to requeſt other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to ſtay, if it be a Miniſters duty to Flie: Neither can you argue a double Cure; the ableſt Patient needs the beſt Phyſician, according to that of our Saviour, <hi>They that</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:33715:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>are whole need no Phyſician, but they that are ſick;</hi> Now <hi>I</hi> take it for granted, that your abilities ſurpaſs thoſe of your Curates, or elſe its pity you ſhould enjoy ſuch preferments; but it may be you will be more ingenuous and faithful, and confeſs that fear was the cauſe of your Flight; Conſider then 1. The ſad doom of thoſe who betray the truth out of fear: 2. How much better were it for men of your ſpirits, to content your ſelves with more private Benefices, whence your Flight at ſuch a time as this might be leſs of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive and prejudicial to the publick; If the Magiſtrates and other Officers of this place had followed your footings, would not this in all probability have induced two greater Judgments, <hi>Famine</hi> and the <hi>Sword,</hi> which <hi>I</hi> fear is wiſhed for by the <hi>plague-Parents</hi> of this place, <hi>Sectaries</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels;</hi> for ſo you finde them <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. 42. &amp;c. If Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates had Fled, how ſhould we have been protected? if inferiour Officers, how ſhould the poor have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved? Further, beſides that it conduces to the publick good, how much might a timely Reſignation of your li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings in this place, have conduced to the Glory of God, and quiet of your own Conſciences; Though I believe you are fearful, yet <hi>I</hi> dare not think that you are ſo far void of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as not to be troubled at that poiſon which may be ſuckt in by your people, from the mouths of Sectaries, who have not only crept into your pariſhes, but alſo (as <hi>I</hi> am credibly informed) into ſome of your Pulpits: Thus Gentlemen <hi>I</hi> have writ to you with all plainneſs, in order to the ſatisfaction of the publick, and not out of vain oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, though <hi>I</hi> confeſs <hi>I</hi> glory in this, that God hath given me courage to execute my Office, notwithſtanding the great mortalitie that is in this pariſh where <hi>I</hi> am an unworthy Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter:
