            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>To you he appeals, the Witty, Fair, and Good;</l>
               <l>Whose soveraign power can never be withstood,</l>
               <l>To all the Audience be bid me say,</l>
               <l>He of the Gout lay in, and of this Play</l>
               <l>Not long continu'd his Poetick Fit,</l>
               <l>The other grief he cannot part with yet,</l>
               <l>But give him case, and let who will have Wit.</l>
               <l>Your kind Indulgence sure he ought to gain,</l>
               <l>Who for your pleasure writes in spight of Pain:</l>
               <l>You have been kind to many of his Plays,</l>
               <l>And shou'd not leave him in his latter days.</l>
               <l>Though Loyal Writers of the last two Reigns,</l>
               <l>Who tir'd their Pens for Popery and Chains;</l>
               <l>Grumble at the Reward of all his Pains:</l>
               <l>They would, like some, the benefit enjoy,</l>
               <l>Of what they vilely labour'd to destroy.</l>
               <l>They cry him down as for his place unfit,</l>
               <l>Since they have all the humour and the Wit,</l>
               <l>They must write better e're he fears them yet;</l>
               <l>Till they have shown you more Variety,</l>
               <l>Of natural, unstoln Comedy than he,</l>
               <l>By you at least he should Protected be.</l>
               <l>Till then may he that Mark of Bounty have,</l>

            <stage>Enter <hi>Sir William Rant</hi> in his Morning-Gown, and <hi>Ralph</hi> his Man.</stage>
            <sp>

               </speaker>
               <p>I Am plaguy qualmish this morning, we drunk swingingly last night, what did we do? tell me the History.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ralph.</speaker>
               <p>Must every Morning be spent in asking Questions? 'tis a fine life, you'le sin over Night, and I must come to Confession next Morning.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir <hi>Will.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <l>Sirrah, Know I will have no Wit nor Wisdom from you.</l>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ralph.</speaker>
               <p>I don't know what you call Wit, but certainly Wisdom will never agree with that hot head of yours, Sir!</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir <hi>Will.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>You solid Lump of Massy Phlegm! there is no such blessing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Heaven, as a hot Head.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ralph.</speaker>
               <p>'Twill cost you and your Companions dear before you part with it; the Devil on't is, you are always the Transgressor, and I never fail of being the Penitent.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir <hi>Will.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Sirrah, The Inside of thy Loggerhead will endanger the Outside, if thou begin not thy Narrative immediately; some Action in the forepart of night, I remember, but the latter part is all Darkness to me: Yet it runs in my head we had a Fray.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ralph.</speaker>
               <p>And don't you feel it in your Shoulders? I am sure you've Reason, so have I.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir <hi>Will.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <l>Where was it?</l>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ralph.</speaker>
               <p>Why here, in <hi>Covent-Garden.</hi> You would needs have a Skirmish with some drunken Bullies, awkward, roaring, blustering Rascals: And Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadier <hi>Stokes</hi> with a detachment of Quarter-Staves, and rusty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Halberts fell in Pell Mell and routed both Parties.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir <hi>Will.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>That damn'd Quarter-staff Rogue would be universal Monarch of the Night; We must confederate and humble him, but what execution was there? Whose Skull crackt? whose Lungs pierced? or who lustily bruised.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ralph.</speaker>
               <p>One of the Bullies has a good lusty flesh wound, the other are a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle hackt, but all of them wer carryed Captive to the <hi>Round-house,</hi> where they have solaced with Ale and Brandy all night long: Two of your Footmen with bloody Coxcombs, were likewise in Limbo: Two or three of the Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have slight hurts, which they are ready to swear are mortal; But your Friends Mr. <hi>Tope</hi> and Mr <hi>Wildfire</hi> are escap'd unhurt, save a little dry beating which indeed we seldom fail of.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir <hi>Will.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>An Evening very handsomely spent; I am glad the Bullies are maul'd. I would rejoyce as much to run an English Bully through, as an Irish
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64553:4"/>
Rapparee. The City ought to pay a certain number of Bullies heads a tribute to the Government, as the Welsh did Wolves; but see my Footmen ransom'd.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ralph.</speaker>
               <p>They are bayl'd by your Taylor, and dress'd by your Surgeon, and are ready to be drunk, and scower again, Sir, but that was not all, that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened last night, 'twould take a Volume to write the History of your Actions one week.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir <hi>Will.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <l>We should be diligent, I love an active life, but what more?</l>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ralph.</speaker>
               <p>Why, in your retreat homewards you pick'd up a Strumpet! I must needs say not very handsome, nor over well drest, nor extreamly sober, nor extraordinary clean, and made me put her to bed in your own Bed, I thank you, Sir.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir <hi>Will.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <l>Well, thou art a faithful Bawd.</l>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ralph.</speaker>
               <l>Bawd, Sir?</l>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir <hi>Will.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Yes Bawd Sir, what a Devil dost thou think I keep thee for thy neat parts? Indeed thou art a little stout.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ralph.</speaker>
               <p>Any man but my Master, should find I were a great deal so, if he talk'd thus to me.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir <hi>Will.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <l>Well well Sir, but where is the Whore?</l>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ral.</speaker>
               <l>I believe where she should be, at the civil Recreation of Hemp-beating.</l>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir <hi>Will.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <l>Pox on your Impertinence! How got she out?</l>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ralph.</speaker>
               <p>Why truly Sir, after you had taken your wonted Nap in your Chair, recover'd a little, and came to your Bed-side, you puk'd at the sight of her, ask'd her how she had the Impudence to bring so ugly a Countenance along with her under your Roof: To all Entreaties were inexorable, you tore her out of the bed, flung her clothes out of the window, and made me turn her naked out of the house.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir <hi>Will.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <l>'Twas a very impudent thing of an ugly Jade to come hither.</l>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ralph.</speaker>
               <p>She pick'd up her Clothes, but was in great want of a Tiring-room; and most certainly fell into the enemies hands.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir <hi>Will.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <l>Well, and I have never a wench this morning?</l>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ralph.</speaker>
               <l>Here have been five or six, they all said they'd come again.</l>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir <hi>Will.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Pox on 'em, come again! but into whose hands may they fall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they come again? I hate even a Rose, after it opens in the morning, and is ruffled by the wind.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ralph.</speaker>
               <p>Your provident, prudent, and pious House-keeper has lodged two who came last night, for peace sake, in two several apartments of your Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio, not knowing which of them you would vouchsafe your Handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief to.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir <hi>Will.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <l>She has done wisely, I will have them both: Who are they?</l>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ralph.</speaker>
               <l>Mrs. <hi>Haughty</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Mavis.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir <hi>Will.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Oh pox they'll never draw together. But go into my Closet and fetch me a bottle of Spirit of Clary, and a lusty Glass.</p>
               <stage>Exit Ralph.</stage>
               <p>Now is my Father I warrant grieving in the Country bewailing my lewd courses: To say truth, I cannot but love him, he has been very indulgent to me; but methinks he should have the conscience to remember his own youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful gambols; <hi>Tope</hi> tells me he knew him almost as lewd a fellow as my self.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64553:4"/>
But the worst of all is I am in love, most desperate most abominable love, the worst of all love, I am afraid honest love.</p>
               <stage>Enter Ralph.</stage>

               <p>Set it down, and see what confounded <stage>[A great noise of talking and knocking without.</stage> noise that is without. The Devil take 'em, must I be always interrupted in my rest or my pleasure? a man had as good be a great man as a Drunkard at this rate.</p>
               <stage>Exit Ralph, and suddenly re-enters.</stage>
               <p>Well what's the matter?</p>

               <p>Puh this is nothing, why I knew the Hectors, and before thom the <hi>Muns</hi> and the <hi>Titire Tu's,</hi> they were brave fellows indeed; in those days a man could not go from the <hi>Rose Tavern</hi> to the <hi>Piazza</hi> once, but he must ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture his life twice.

               <p>Old! Gad take me, hem, hem; here's a body sound wind and limb! Old! quoth he. Indeed I have drank off two generations, and intend to drink off three more yet. Why I wench'd, drunk and scowr'd with thy Father, <hi>Will:</hi> He was a pretty fellow in his youth, and I thought he would have come to something, but he married and run into the Country, left our noble cause, and grew a very wise, discreet, vertuous Country Jobbernoll.</p>

               <p>I knew him in his ebb: but thy Father, <hi>Tom,</hi> was a sober for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptive Scoundrel, and we could make nothing of him, he married like a Puppy, and grew most pitifully uxorious, but the comfort is few of that sort get their own Children: Thou art not like him at all.</p>

               <p>Every Puppy, now a-days, presumes to set up for a Drunkard; but there are more good qualities requisite to a Drunkard than to a Minister of State, or a deep Divine. I'll pick up fellows fit for great men every hour in the Streets, but a Drunkard.—</p>

               <l>NOW Lady Mothers, you who frown to Day,</l>
               <l>Will be thought like the Lady of this Play;</l>
               <l>You'll not condemn your selves, but like bad Faces,</l>
               <l>Loath the Reflections, and abhor true Glasses:</l>
               <l>But know all, by these Presents; there's no way</l>
               <l>But Gentleness, to make ripe Girls obey:</l>
               <l>Us'd ill, if they have Beauty, Wit, or Sence;</l>
               <l>They will rebel in their own just Defence.</l>
               <l>You in your selves, from Grandam <hi>Eve</hi> shou'd find,</l>
               <l>The true Perverseness of a Womans Mind,</l>
               <l>To what is most forbidden, most inclin'd;</l>
               <l>What sharply to your Daughters you deny,</l>
               <l>You fire their Curiosities to try:</l>
               <l>They think when strictly kept from all Mankind,</l>
               <l>There's much more in't than afterwards they find.</l>
               <l>Your selves, go Flanting to all publick Places,</l>
               <l>Exposing all you can, your Feeble Graces,</l>
               <l>Darting weak Rays from your Autumnal Faces.</l>
               <l>Heav'n knows true Languishing of Eyes you show,</l>
               <l>When e're you mince, and simper at a <hi>Beaux;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>High Dresses, and rich Pettieoats will tell us,</l>
               <l>That all your Ornaments you wear at Fellows;</l>
               <l>Like Woodcocks, or like Teagues pursu'd, you hide</l>
               <l>Your Heads, and think your Body's unespy d;</l>
               <l>Your Daughters find you out, and will obey,</l>
               <l>What e're they see you do; not hear you say.</l>
               <l>The Gawdy Mother hates the Daughters sight,</l>
               <l>Whose dazling Beams Eclipse her glimmering Light;</l>
               <l>She must the Visitants but seldom see,</l>
               <l>And when admitted to the Company,</l>
               <l>With down cast Looks she enters, and affraid,</l>
               <l>She sneaks like an offending Chamber-maid:</l>
               <l>VVith toss'd up Head, she must be snub'd and chidden,</l>
               <l>And Mothers dear Delights to her forbidden;</l>
               <l>This begets Scorn, how can one stand in awe,</l>
               <l>Of a vain Tawdry, Amorous <hi>Mamma.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Of these the Poet must despair to Day,</l>
               <l>They will be mortal Foes to him and's Play.</l>
               <l>VVhile these frail Dames the Author does expose,</l>
               <l>The Lustre of the Good, that clearly shews,</l>
               <l>From them a Plaudit must not be deny'd,</l>
               <l>The VVitty, Fair ones, must be on our side,</l>
               <l>So much their Power by him is magnify'd.</l>
               <l>VVe show you how your vigorous Beams t'exert,</l>
               <l>Young vicious men to Conquer and Convert:</l>
               <l>Firm to our selves we always have a way,</l>
