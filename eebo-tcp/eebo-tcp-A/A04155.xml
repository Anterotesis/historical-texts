            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the Printers


<pb facs="tcp:225:3"/>
hands diverse daies ere
ever I purposed any
nuncupation, or dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of it at all. At
last, it came into my
minde to addresse it
this way, and that for
these causes. first, out of
honour to your chiefe,
<hi>Arch-Bishop Hutton,</hi> of
whom for his learning,
and gravitie, this great
Encomium was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely
given, that hee
was <hi>worthy to sit Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in a generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell.</hi>
Secondly, because
I was well ascertained,
my book could receive


<pb facs="tcp:225:3"/>
no smut from you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
people of whole
fame for native gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
innocency of
manners, faire deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
and uniforme pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of Religion.
Thirdly, for that the
most of you are spread
into a goodly posterity
and have faire sonnes
and daughters, unto
whom these things may
bee truely usefull to
ground them soundly
in Religion, so as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <pb facs="tcp:225:4"/>
ever <hi>starve</hi> in them those
due respects they owe to
divine powers. Would
God parents would at
last be wise, and thinke
it were conduceable to
the hopefull setling of
a child, to aime at more
of <hi>instruction</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
though lesse
of <hi>provision.</hi> Fourthly,
in acknowledgement of
that great love, sweet fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity,
and continuall
intercourses of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
acquaintance which
you were ever pleased
to hold with mee, both
affecting my person,


<pb facs="tcp:225:4"/>
and leaning to my mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery
farre beyond
the proportion of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert.
Lastly, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
for the pious me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of that worthy
Knight Sir <hi>Timothy Hut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
your deare Father,
and my most incorrupt
Patron. Into the menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of whom being fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,
I cannot containe
my pen, but to his great
praise I must relate one
or two things of him in
this very regard: first
that comming to settle
his family at <hi>Marske,</hi>
and finding the <hi>Rector</hi>


               <pb facs="tcp:225:5"/>
there to be no more but
a bare reader, he rested
not till hee had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
forth the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
incumbent, and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Church with a
preaching Ministery.
And when it was empty
againe by the death of
that incumbent, he most
freely presented my selfe
with out the least request
made in my behalfe to
him, either by my selfe,
or any other; yea hee
besought mee earnestly
to take it, and when he
signed the presentation
he drew with his pen the


<pb facs="tcp:225:5"/>
forme of his heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
his name and
sir-name. and I can well
take an accompt of my
memory, that the Bpp
of the diocesse, when he
gave institution, asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vehemently that I
had the best and most
upright Patron living.
This I say not onely for
his <hi>honour,</hi> but also for
the just <hi>defamation</hi> both
of such <hi>Patrons</hi> (sonnes
of the earth whosoever
they be) as thinke hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and earth would
faile them for mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
and support, if


<pb facs="tcp:225:6"/>
they should present a
<hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Priest</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
some sprinckling
either of direct or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect

of such <hi>Clerkes</hi> as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
they believe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection

after they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cined
to dust, and yet
dare not trust God for
food and raiment, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
these indirect and
symoniacall contracts.
But I containe.</p>
            <p>These things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

Paper, shall be made knowne unto
thee in a few following Paragraphs.</p>
            <p>First, Being a man full of lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
hee thought they might <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>
(through Gods blessing) prove a
few well spent houres to compose
some little <hi>Theologicall tractate,</hi>
or <hi>manuall of Devotion,</hi> which
might be truly usefull to militant
Christians, either to <hi>beget,</hi> or <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve</hi>
Religion in their hearts.
Wherein he had a speciall aime to
serve the Salvation of two sorts
of people: first, of his <hi>Parcchiall
charge,</hi> or the slocke whereof hee
is made an Over-seer; Secondly,


<pb facs="tcp:225:8"/>
of such <hi>Christian friends</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
(of what degree soever)
dispersed here and there, as did
more peculiarly love his person,
or approve his work in the ministery
thinking he might take more liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and boldnesse of speech to speake
unto every of them in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of <hi>Saint Paul</hi> to his Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
<hi>Timothy: Thou hast fully
knowne my doctrine: continue

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> 2. His Second thoughts were,
in so doing to practise <hi>selfe-deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,</hi>
in meerely serving Vertue, and
not fame; and not to theame his
pen with some high and applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

            <p>Thirdly, Hereupon hee resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/>
to draw and pourtray the
whole entire <hi>body of divioitie</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
called <hi>The revealed will of
God,</hi> and cast it into little moulds
or formes, as <hi>Alexander</hi> did all
<hi>Homers</hi> Iliads into a nut-shell, and
as <hi>Regiomontanus</hi> did his exquisite
motions into the little body of a flie,
yet so as he endeavoured to free it
from those two monstrosities both
of Nature and Art, <hi>Defect</hi> of any
thing necessary on the one hand, and
<hi>redundancie</hi> or excesse of any thing
superfluous on the other.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Hee acquired and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IIII"/>

worthy addressing of a mans selfe
to the Lords table, to receive the

beene esteemed an high piece of
Pietie, and one of the most eminent
performances which a militant
Christian can goe about, as being
one of the neerest approaches wee

see that those who are under their

in the principles of Religion,
whilst they are yet of very tender
yeares. for it is scarce to be credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,

2. The second Advertisement
is this, that the <hi>Catechist,</hi> that is,
hee, or shee, who takes upon them
the office to instruct, and Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chize
others, stand in some faire
and neere relation to the <hi>Catechu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menoi,</hi>
that is, those who are taught
and instructed: by which meanes it
comes to passe that their principles
are more <hi>authentick, authoritative</hi>
and <hi>magisteriall,</hi> and the doctrine
which they instill, proves both
more <hi>strong,</hi> by reason of the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
of a Superiour, and more
<hi>sweet,</hi> by reason of the love of a
familiar. Oh then documents
sticke, when wee can say, <hi>I know
of whom I have learned them.</hi>
Then rudiments and grounds are
indeed <hi>Nailes</hi> to fasten in the
memory, and <hi>goads</hi> to pricke on
the Affections, Eccles. 12. 11.
Thus <hi>Samuel</hi> was instructed by
<hi>Eli,</hi> and young <hi>Jehoash</hi> by <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jadah,</hi>
both Priests; the great
Eunuch by <hi>Philip,</hi> a Deacon;
<hi>Paul</hi> by his tutour <hi>Gamaliel; Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi>


               <pb facs="tcp:225:12"/>
by his mother, and Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother,
<hi>Lois</hi> and <hi>Eunice; Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi>

Neither ought any one thinke they
lesson themselves unto any low
indecencies in playing the duty of

whilst they see whole Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,

persons for learning, vertue,
and honour have descended even
unto the practiques herein, one I
cannot omit: Saint <hi>Hierom, for
learning</hi> so great a Clerke, as S.
<hi>Augustine</hi> seriously wished to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quallize
him, <hi>for sanctity</hi> so rare,
as it is farre more easy to <hi>counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit</hi>
him then <hi>imitate</hi> him: hee ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ving
exhorted <hi>Leta</hi> to send her
daughter to her Grandmother
<hi>Paula</hi> at <hi>Bethleem,</hi> to be educated
there, addes certaine words, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
hee binds himselfe to become
master and Catechist to the child,
saying hee will carry her upon his
armes, and on his shoulders, and


<pb facs="tcp:225:13"/>
that as old as hee was, hee would
teach her stammeringly to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
her words, and that in this
regard hee would not esteeme him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
lesse glorious then <hi>Aristotle,</hi>
who had <hi>Alexander</hi> the sonne of
<hi>Philip,</hi> King of <hi>Macedon</hi> for his
Scholler, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>3. The third Advertisement
must be this, that the disciple or
scholler be throughly acquainted by
his Catechist and instructer with
the <hi>Scheme</hi> and <hi>method</hi> of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
or Catechisme, for as in
reading of holy Scripture, who so
meanes to understand what hee
reades, must labour to get into his
head the structure and fabricke,
that is, the <hi>Oeconomie,</hi> and <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
of that booke of holy writ, that
he is reading: So whosoever would
bee fully instructed in Christian
Religion, must first get unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
a perfect and methodicall
forme of sound doctrine, and then
before he goe to particulars, must
possesse his understanding of the


<pb facs="tcp:225:13"/>
generall lineaments and portrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of that body of Divinitie,
which hee meanes to make his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
for his knowledge to saile by.
To instance in these subsequent
moulds and formes of Divinitie.
The oeconomie and disposition of
the first stands in the unfolding of
three points, 1. Mans <hi>misery</hi> by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>
the fall. 2. His <hi>redresse</hi> from
that misery. 3. His <hi>thankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi>
for that redresse: which is
also the manner and forme both
of the Heidelberge Catechisme, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized
through all the low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
and the Palatinate, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
of Alstedius his Catechisme
which hee calls the <hi>little bible,</hi> and
the very same is the oeconomie of
the Epistle to the Romans, which is
called the <hi rend="sup">f</hi>

                  </gap> Scripturae.</note> The
Oeconomie of the second is this, it
takes the first hint and rise from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
Saint Pauls dichotomie, Titus 1.
1. which distinguisheth Religion
into<note n="g" place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:225:14"/>
and explained the Apostles
Creed, and under <hi>Godlinesse</hi> the
second head is handled the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,
the Lords prayer,
and the doctrine of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> The third is of a circular
forme, like a snake holding the
taile in the mouth: of which forme
also are divers of Davids Psalmes
which are called circular Odes, as
Psalm. 8. and 117. and the five
last Psalmes. Enterance is made
into it by the very same quere that
Calvin doth into his so famous Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techisme,
that it is translated into
all the 3. learned Languages, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,
Greeke, and Hebrew; and
from thence, like the river of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
Gen. 2. 10. it spreads it selfe
into 4 heads, the first of <hi>Faith,</hi> or
thinges to bee beleeved, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
of <hi>Love,</hi> or thinges to bee
done, The third of <hi>Prayer,</hi> or
things to be asked, and the fourth
of the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> or thinges to be
sealed: and this is the Oeconomie
of Canisius, and Bellarmines Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>echismes,


<pb facs="tcp:225:14"/>
&amp;c. And to adde a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IIII"/>
word touching the mode and forme
of the last tractate, concerning the
holy Eucharist and the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants
worthy receiving of it, it's
method is pure Scripturall, for who
so hath but saluted the holy ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuall
tongue of the old Testament
knowes that<note n="h" place="margin">Quadru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliciplanxit alphabeto Hieron, praefat.</note> Ieremies Threnes and

and purpose, to helpe memory both
to <hi>attaine</hi> and <hi>retaine</hi> them with

to warrant this way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing;<note n="l" place="margin">Baron. ad an. 392. num. 6.</note>
Ecclesiasticall History
makes mention of an <hi>Abecedary
Psalme,</hi> which Saint Augustine so
made up against the Donatists.</p>
            <p>The 4. and last advertisement
is this, that to make a brave know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and intellectuall Christian in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
the way is, to referre the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
which he reads, and the Ser<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mons
he heares, unto those heads
and points of Catechisme, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto


<pb facs="tcp:225:15"/>
they specially and most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
belong. And to doe this
the better, learners and beginners
are not onely to make use of their
owne dexterity and skill so farre
as they are able, but also till they
be well versed in this way, consult
with their Superiours and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
get them to looke over them
while they practise, intreat them
freely to use their <hi>asteriskes</hi> of
approbation where they hit, and
their spunges and <hi>obeliskes</hi> where
they misse. The benefit redounding
hence will be this, First, an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
establishment and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the truth to see ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
bookes, Scriptures, &amp;c. all
to concurre and be concentrique to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
Secondly, an excellent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geny
and quicknesse both in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the principles and fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
of Religion by Scripture, and
in referring texts of Scripture, and
Sermons to principles of Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisme,
which may bee called the
<hi>Genesis</hi> and <hi>Analysis</hi> of Divinity.


<pb facs="tcp:225:15"/>
And I doubt not but by practise a
Lay Christian may doe as much as
Cartwright,<note place="margin">See <hi>Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrights</hi> comment on the Proverbs.</note> who hath referred
every Proverbe of Solomon to one
of the ten Precepts of the morall
Law.</p>
            <p>The Author now thinkes hee
hath prefaced sufficiently, and
will remove <hi>manum de tabula</hi> as
speedily as if hee heard an Angell
from Heaven say, <hi>hold thy hand,
it is enough;</hi> in all which if hee
have iudged any thing <hi>truly,</hi> or
<hi>wisely</hi> hee voweth onely to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
him who is the <hi>first truth,</hi> and

            <p>Now the good will of him that

there are two reasons why
