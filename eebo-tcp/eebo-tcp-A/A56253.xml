         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE
TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>THAT Hiſtory is the moſt pleaſant and
uſefull Study for Perſons of Quality, and
more particularly for thoſe who deſign for
Employments in the State, is well known
to all Men of Learning. It is therefore requiſite, that
young Gentlemen ſhould be exhorted early to apply
themſelves to this Study, not only becauſe their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
is vigorous, and more capable to retain what
they then learn, but alſo becauſe it may be concluded,
that he who has no Reliſh for Hiſtory is very unlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to make any Advantage of Learning or Books. It
is a common Cuſtom as well in Publick as Private
Schools, to read to their Scholars ſome ancient Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians;
and there are a great many who employ ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Years in reading of <hi>Cornelius Nepos, Curtius,
Juſtin</hi> and <hi>Livy,</hi> but never as much as take into
their Conſideration the Hiſtory of later Times. 'Tis
<pb facs="tcp:65650:5"/>
true, and it cannot be deny'd, but that we ought to
begin with the ancient Hiſtorians, they being equally
uſefull and pleaſant; but that the Hiſtory of later
Times is ſo much neglected is a great Miſtake and
want of Underſtanding in thoſe to whom the Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Youth is committed; for I lay down this as
a Principle, That we are to ſtudy thoſe Things in
our Youth, which may prove uſefull to us hereafter,
when we come to riper Years, and apply our ſelves
to Buſineſs. Now I cannot for my life apprehend,
what great Benefit we can expect to receive from
<hi>Cornelius Nepos, Curtius,</hi> and the firſt Decad of
<hi>Livy,</hi> as to our Modern Affairs, tho' we had
learn'd them by Heart, and had, beſides this, made
a perfect <hi>Index</hi> of all the Phraſes and Sentences
that are to be found in them: Or if we were ſo well
vers'd in them, as to be able to give a moſt exact
account, how many Cows and Sheep the <hi>Romans</hi> led
in Triumph when they had conquer'd the <hi>Aequi,</hi> the
<hi>Volſci,</hi> and the <hi>Hernici.</hi> But what a conſiderable
Advantage it is to underſtand the Modern Hiſtory
as well of our Native Country, as alſo its neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Nations, is ſufficiently known to ſuch as are
employ'd in States Affairs. But it is not ſo eaſie a
matter to acquire this Knowledge, partly becauſe thoſe
Hiſtories are comprehended in large and various
Volumes; partly becauſe they are generally publiſh'd
in the native Language of each Country; ſo that
he who intends to apply himſelf to this Study muſt
be well vers'd in Foreign Languages. To remove in
ſome meaſure this Difficulty, I did ſome Years ago,
for the Benefit of ſome young Gentlemen in <hi>Swede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
compile a Compendium, in which was compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
the Hiſtory of ſuch States as ſeem'd to have
any Reference unto this Kingdom, with an Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
only to give them the firſt taſt of thoſe Hiſtories
<pb facs="tcp:65650:5"/>
fitted chiefly for their Improvement. But after
this rough Draught had fallen into other Hands,
I had ſome reaſon to fear, leſt ſome covetous
Bookſeller or another might publiſh it imperfect, as
I have known it has happen'd to others, whoſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes
ſcarc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> premeditated, have been publiſh'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
their Will and Knowledge. Wherefore I ſaw
my ſelf oblig'd, notwithſtanding I had but little
Leiſure, to reviſe the ſaid Work<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and after I had
render'd it ſomewhat more perfect, rather to publiſh
it, ſuch as it is, than to ſuffer that another ſhould rob
me of it. I hope therefore, that the Diſcreet Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
will look favourably upon this Work, not as a
Piece deſign'd for Men of great Learning, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted
to the Apprehenſions and Capacities of young
Men, whom I was willing to ſhew the Way, and, as
it were, to give them a taſt, whereby they might be
encouraged to make a further ſearch into this Study.
I muſt here alſo advertiſe the Reader, That becauſe
I have taken the Hiſtory of each Kingdom from its
own Hiſtorians, a great Difference is to be found in
thoſe ſeveral Relations, which concern the Tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of ſome Nations that were at Enmity, it being
a common Obſervation, That their Hiſtorians have
magnify'd thoſe Factions which have prov'd Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to their Native Country, as they have leſſen'd
thoſe that prov'd Unfortunate. To reconcile and
decide theſe Differences was not my Buſineſs, but
to give a clearer inſight into its Hiſtory. I have
added alſo ſuch Obſervations as are generally made
concerning the good and bad Qualifications of each
Nation, nevertheleſs, without any Intention either to
Flatter or Undervalue any; as alſo what concerns the
Nature, Strength and Weakneſs of each Country.
and its form of Government: All which I thought
might be an Inducement to young Gentlemen when
<pb facs="tcp:65650:6"/>
they Travel or Converſe with Men of greater Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
in the Affairs of the World, to be more
inquiſitive into thoſe Matters. What I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
concerning the Intereſt of each State, is to be
conſider'd as relating chiefly to that Time when I
compos'd this Work And, tho' I muſt confeſs,
that this is a Matter more ſuitable to the Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Men of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding than young People,
yet I could not paſs it by in Silence, ſince this is to
be eſteem'd the Principle, from whence muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
whether State-Affairs are either well or ill
managed. I muſt alſo mention one thing more,
which may ſerve as an Inſtruction to young Men,
<hi>Viz.</hi> That this Intereſt may be divided into an Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
and Real Intereſt. By the firſt I underſtand,
when a Prince judges the Welfare of his State to
conſiſt in ſuch things as cannot be perform'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
diſquieting and being injurious to a great many
other States, and which theſe are oblig'd to oppoſe
with all their Power: As for Example, The Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
of <hi>Europe,</hi> or the univerſal Monopoly, this
being the Fuel with which the whole World may be
put into a Flame. <hi>Num ſi vos omnibus imperare
vultis, ſequitur ut omnes ſervitutem accipiant?
If you would be the only Maſters of the World,
doth it thence follow, that all others ſhould lay
their Necks under your Yoke?</hi> The Real Intereſt
may be ſubdivided into a Perpetual and Temporary.
The former depends chiefly on the Situation and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of the Country, and the natural Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the People; the latter, on the Condition,
Strength and Weakneſs of the neighbouring Nations;
for as thoſe vary, the Intereſt muſt alſo vary.
Whence it often happens, that whereas we are, for
our own Security, ſometimes oblig'd to aſſiſt a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Nation, which is likely to be oppreſs'd by a
<pb facs="tcp:65650:6"/>
more potent Enemy; we at another time are forc'd
to oppoſe the Deſigns of thoſe we before aſſiſted; when
we find they have recover'd themſelves to that degree,
as that they may prove Formidable and Troubleſome
to us. But ſeeing this Intereſt is ſo manifeſt to thoſe
who are vers'd in State-Affairs, that they can't be
ignorant of it; one might ask, How it often times
happens, that great Errors are committed in this
kind againſt the Intereſt of the State. To this
may be anſwer'd, That thoſe who have the Supream
Adminiſtration of Affairs, are oftentimes not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
inſtructed concerning the Intereſt both of their
own State, as alſo that of their Neighbours; and
yet being fond of their own Sentiments, will not
follow the Advice of underſtanding and faithfull
Miniſters. Sometimes they are miſguided by their
Paſſions, or by Time-ſerving Miniſters and Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites.
But where the Adminiſtration of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
is committed to the Care of Miniſters of
State, it may happen, that theſe are not capable of
diſcerning it, or elſe are led away by a private. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
which is oppoſite to that of the State; or
elſe, being divided into Factions, they are more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
to ruin their Rivals, than to follow the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates
of Reaſon. Therefore ſome of the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
parts of Modern Hiſtory conſiſts in this,
that one knows the Perſon who is the Sovereign, or
the Miniſters, which rule a State, their Capacity,
Inclinations, Caprices, Private Intereſts, manner of
proceeding, and the like: Since unpon this depends,
in a great meaſure, the good and ill management of
a State. For it frequently happens, That a State,
which in it ſelf conſider'd, is but weak, is made to
become very conſiderable by the good Conduct and
Valour of its Governours; whereas a powerfull State,
by the i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l management of thoſe that ſit at the
<pb facs="tcp:65650:7"/>
Helm, oftentimes ſuffers conſiderably. But as the
Knowledge of theſe Matters appertains properly to
thoſe who are employ'd in the management of Foreign
Affairs, ſo it is mutable, conſidering how often the
Scene is chang'd at Court. Wherefore it is better
learn'd from Experience and the Converſation of Men
well vers'd in theſe Matters, than from any Books
whatſoever. And this is what I thought my ſelf
oblig'd to touch upon in a few Words in this Preface.</p>

               <p>§. 1. NO Man of Common Senſe, imagines, that
at the firſt Propagation of Mankind,<note place="margin">The moſt anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent State of Mankind.</note> there
were ſuch Governments as are among
us at this time. But in thoſe Times each Father,
without being Subject to any Superiour Power,
governed his Wife, Children and Servants, as a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign.
Nay, it ſeems very probable to me, that even
to the time of the Deluge, there was no Magiſtracy,
or any Civil Conſtitution; but that the Government
was lodged only in each Father of his Family. For it
is ſcarce to be imagined, that ſuch abominable Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders
could have been introduced, where the Power
of Magiſtrates and Laws was exerciſed: And it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable,
that after once the Rules of Government
were Conſtituted, we do not find that Mankind in
general did run into the ſame Enormities, of which
God Almighty was obliged to purge the World by an
Univerſal Puniſhment, though the Root of the Evil
was remaining as well after as before the Deluge. It
ſeems alſo, that for a conſiderable time after the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge
this Paternal Government continued in the
World.</p>
               <p>

§. 2.<note place="margin">The Original of Civil Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> But the reaſon why the Fathers of Families
left this Separate way of living, and joyned in a Mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
civil Society, ſeems to be, That among the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Families, ſometimes Quarrels uſed to ariſe,
which being often decided by Force, drew along with
them very great Inconveniencies, to prevent which,
it was thought neceſſary for the Preſervation of Peace
and Quietneſs among Neighbours, to referr the Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of ſuch Matters to the Judgment of ſome of the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt
and moſt Conſiderable among them. After the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
of Mankind, it was alſo eaſily to be obſerved,
how difficult it would prove for a Single Family to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
it ſelf againſt the Joint Conſpiracy of a malicious
Party, to Oppoſe which, the Neighbours living ſo near,
as to be able to aſſiſt one another in caſe of Neceſſity,
did enter into a Society Mutually to defend themſelves
againſt their Common Enemies. That they might do
this with the better Succeſs, the Adminiſtration of the
whole Society was committed to him, who appeared
moſt Conſiderable for his Wiſdom and Valour. It is
alſo very Probable that ſuch as by Common Conſent
ſought out new Habitations, choſe a Leader, who
both in their Journey, and in the Country, which they
poſſeſſed themſelves of, had the chief Direction of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs:
And this office of a Judge, Head, or Leader by
degrees degenerated into that ſort of Government,
which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> calls <hi>Heroical,</hi> which is nothing elſe
but a <hi>Democracy</hi> under the Authority of one of the
Citizens, who has a Power rather to Adviſe than to
Command the reſt. And this ſeems to be the moſt ancient
Form of <hi>Republicks:</hi> for the Fathers and Rulers of their
Families could not ſo ſoon forget their Liberty, as not
to Reſerve to themſelves a ſhare in the Government by
which their Conſent was required to be given unto all
Matters, which were to be decreed in the Name of the
whole Society.</p>
               <p>§. 3.<note place="margin">At what time the firſt States were conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> But at what time preciſely theſe Societies were
firſt Inſtituted, and which of them is to be eſteemed
the moſt Ancient, is not eaſie to be determined; for
though commonly the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Empire is taken for
the firſt Monarchy, yet it is not from hence to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65650:16"/>
that the ſame was the firſt civil Society; ſince
it is evident that this Empire acquired its Greatneſs by
ſwallowing up Leſſer States. And thoſe Wars which the
<hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Kings waged againſt other States, do abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
teſtifie, that beſides the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> there were alſo
other Civil Societies even at that time in the World.
And here is to be obſerved, that as all human Affairs
do not come immediately to Perfection, ſo were the
firſt Inſtitutions of Civil Society very ſimple and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,<note place="margin">The firſt States were very ſmall and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect.</note>
till by degrees the Supreme Civil Power, together
with ſuch Laws and Conſtitutions as were requiſite for
the maintaining of a Civil Society, were inſtituted.
The firſt Common-wealths alſo were very ſmall, and
their Territories of a very little extent, ſo that it was
eaſie for the Citizens to aſſemble, either to Conſult or
to Defend themſelves againſt a Foreign Power. It is
evident out of Hiſtory, that the deeper you ſearch into
the moſt ancient Times, the more Separate ſmall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths
you will meet withal, out of the Union
of which great Empires in Proceſs of time did ariſe,
ſome of thoſe Uniting themſelves by common Conſent,
others being Subdued by the more Powerfull.</p>
               <p>§. 4. Among theſe great Empires,<note place="margin">The Aſſyrian Empire.</note> the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> is
commonly reckoned the moſt Ancient, the reaſon of
which may probably be, That thoſe Parts were Sooner,
and More Inhabited than other places, which being
later poſſeſſed had Fewer Inhabitants. Wherefore the
<hi>Aſſyrians</hi> might without much difficulty overcome one
ſmall Common-wealth after another, and by Subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſome, make way for an Entire Conqueſt over the
reſt, that had not then learned the advantage of a
joint Power and Confederacy. The vaſt Armies with
which <hi>Ninus</hi> and <hi>Semiramis</hi> (the firſt Founders of this
Monarchy) did over-power far diſtant Nations, make
the common Chronologies very doubtfull: But to ſettle
this is not to our preſent purpoſe. But by what means
the Kings of this vaſt Empire did bridle the Conquered
Nations, ought to be remembred, Two of them being
moſt remarkable.<note place="margin">By what means this Empire was maintained.</note> The Firſt was, That they intending
to imprint an Extraordinary Character of their Perſons
into the Minds of the People, they always kept them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65650:17"/>
very cloſe in their Palaces, and being ſeldom to
be ſeen by any but their neareſt Servants, they never
gave Anſwer to their Subjects Petitions but by them.
Whereby they poſſeſſed the People that they were
much above the Common Rank of Mankind. The
Second was, That every Year they uſed to draw a
certain number of Souldiers out of each Province, and
theſe being Quartered in and about the place of their
Reſidence, and Commanded by ſuch a one as was
thought moſt faithfull, theſe Forces ſtruck Terrour
both into the Subjects at Home and the neighbouring
Nations Abroad. This Army was again Disbanded
every year, and another drawn out of the Provinces,
that the General by the Authority he had with the
Soldiers, might not be in a condition to Invade the
Empire.<note place="margin">Its Fall.</note> The Ruin of this Empire under <hi>Sardanapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi>
is not ſo much to be aſcribed to his Effeminacy,
as to this, That the Kings allowed too much Power
to the Governours of Provinces of ſo vaſt an extent.
Theſe grew at laſt too Powerfull for the Kings them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
who being lull'd aſleep by Voluptuouſneſs (the
effects of Peace and Plenty) did not, as they uſed to do
formerly, by great Actions endeavour to maintain their
Authority among the People. Out of the Ruins of
the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Empire two new Kingdoms were erected;
<hi>Arbactes</hi> taking upon himſelf the Sovereignty of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi>
where he was Governour, as the Lord Lieutenant
of <hi>Babylon</hi> did the ſame in his Province, both which
were afterwards re-united under the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy.</p>
               <p>§. 5. <hi>Cyrus</hi> the firſt Founder of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Empire,<note place="margin">The <hi>Perſian</hi> Empire.</note>
did, beſides what formerly belonged to <hi>Media,</hi> and <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi>
alſo Conquer a great part of the Leſſer <hi>Aſia.</hi> This
Prince, beſides other remarkable Conſtitutions, did wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inſtitute this, as a moſt neceſſary one to preſerve the
Peace of his Empire;<note place="margin">By what means it was maintained.</note> That in all Provinces, where he

had their dependence immediately on the King. Theſe
therefore living in continual Jealouſies, ſerved as a Bridle
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65650:17"/>
to one another. The Lords Lieutenants, without the
Aſſiſtance of the Governours of the Fortreſſes, were
not in a Capacity to Mutiny againſt the King, who
not only Obſerved all their Actions, but alſo frequently
Informed the King concerning their Behaviour. From
the Governours of the Fortreſſes nothing was to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
becauſe, being of Mean Condition and a very Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Power, they were not capable of making any great

whenever the Kings of <hi>Perſia</hi> did undertake to extend
their Conqueſts further, it always proved fruitleſs. <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſes</hi>

Hydaſpes</hi> did the <hi>Scythians.</hi> And <hi>Xerxes</hi> was ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
beaten by the <hi>Greeks:</hi> But the following Kings,
<hi>Artaxerxes Longimanus, Darius Nothus,</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes
Mnemon,</hi> did Manage their Affairs with more
Wiſdom againſt the <hi>Greeks,</hi> whom they did not At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack;
but leaving them at reſt, they quickly ſaw Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine
Wars kindled amongſt themſelves; wherein they
ſo well knew how to play their Game, that by always
affording Aſſiſtance to the weaker Side, they rather
protracted than finiſhed theſe inteſtine Wars, till the
<hi>Greeks,</hi> quite tired and exhauſted, were obliged to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of ſuch Conditions of Peace as were projected by
the <hi>Perſians,</hi> whereby each City being declared free
and independent of one another, <hi>Greece</hi> was diſabled
hereafter to undertake any thing of Moment. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<hi>Macedon,</hi> an obſcure Nation of <hi>Greece,</hi>
proved the Ruin of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy, through
a defect of Policy in their Kings, in not early Oppoſing
the Growing Power of <hi>Philip,</hi> by raiſing Powerfull E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
in <hi>Greece,</hi> againſt him and his Son <hi>Alexander,</hi>
(which for great Summs of Money they might eaſily
have done,) and thus have cut out ſo much Work for
theſe two Warlike Princes at Home, that they
could not have had leiſure ſo much as to have entred
on the thoughts of Invading <hi>Perſia:</hi> In the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
as formerly the <hi>Perſians</hi> had obliged <hi>Ageſilaus</hi>

§. 6.<note place="margin">Greece.</note> 
                  <hi>Greece</hi> was in ancient times divided into a
great many petty Common-wealths, every one of
theſe being governed by its own Laws. Among thoſe
in Proceſs of time, <hi>Athens</hi> grew moſt famous, whoſe
Citizens for Ingenuity, Eloquence, and the knowledge
of Arts and Science, ſurpaſſed all the reſt; their Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
increaſed exceedingly after they had ſignalized them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſo bravely againſt the <hi>Perſians.</hi> After this, by
adding of the Harbour of <hi>Pyreum</hi> to their City, they
made it very commodious for Shipping, and acquired
ſuch vaſt Riches, that by their naval Strength they
ſubdued the Iſles of the <hi>Aegean</hi> Sea and the Coaſts of
the Leſſer <hi>Aſia.</hi> But being puffed up with their good
Succeſs, they drew upon themſelves the hatred of their
Allies: and after they once attempted to be ſole Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of <hi>Greece,</hi> the <hi>Peloponneſians,</hi> headed by the <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi>
(who eſpecially envied the <hi>Athenians)</hi> united to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
to chaſtiſe the inſolence of <hi>Athens.</hi> Yet the
<hi>Athenians</hi> behaved themſelves ſo bravely, that the
War was carried on for a conſiderable time with near e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
Succeſs, till at laſt being vanquiſhed in a Battle
in <hi>Sicily,</hi> they alſo loſt their whole Fleet on the Coaſt
of <hi>Thrace;</hi> then the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> becoming Maſters
of <hi>Athens</hi> conſtituted thirty Governours, who ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannized
moſt cruelly over ſuch of the Citizens of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi>
as ſurvived the Storming of their City; yet <hi>Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibulus</hi>
having expelled the ſame with the aſſiſtance of
ſome of the baniſhed <hi>Athenians,</hi> reſtored the City to
its former Liberty. After this, though the <hi>Athenians</hi>
did recover themſelves a little, yet were they never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to arrive at the former Grandeur of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
and being afterwards too forward in
making head againſt <hi>Philip,</hi> they were ſeverely cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſed
by him. It was therefore the immoderate Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and their deſire of conquering
more than they were able to defend, which occaſioned
their Ruin. For the number of the Citizens of <hi>Athens</hi>
did not exceed ten thouſand, and they rarely receiving
others as Citizens among them, great Cities and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
could not be kept in obedience by ſuch a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and with one unfortunate Blow their whole pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
was ſtruck down without Recovery. And conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65650:18"/>
that ſuch Cities are better fitted for their own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
than making Conqueſts upon others, it is more
adviſeable for them to mind the advantage of their
own Trade, than to inter-meddle too much in foreign
Affairs, and rather to keep ſafe their own Walls, than
to invade their Neighbours.<note place="margin">Sparta.</note> Next to <hi>Athens, Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daemon</hi>
was famous in <hi>Greece,</hi> whoſe Citizens by the
conſtitutions and rigorous Diſcipline introduced by <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curgus,</hi>
ſeem'd to be moſt fitly qualified for warlike
Atchievements. This City having not any powerfull
Neighbour to conteſt withall, was ſtrong enough to
defend its Liberty againſt the Neighbouring Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths.
And the <hi>Spartans,</hi> as long as they, according
to their Laws and Inſtitution, deſpiſed Riches, had no
great occaſion to invade others: But as ſoon as they
began to aim at higher matters, they found by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that it was a quite different caſe to conquer
Kingdoms, than to defend their own City. For ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
had the good Fortune of ſubduing <hi>Athens,</hi> they
fell into the ſame folly which had been the Ruin of the
<hi>Athenians,</hi> and were not only for conquering the <hi>Aſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atick</hi>
Sea Coaſts, but alſo under the Conduct of <hi>Age<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilaus</hi>
they invaded <hi>Perſia.</hi> But it was eaſie for the
King of <hi>Perſia</hi> to find out means to chaſtiſe their Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
who cauſed a diverſion to be made by the <hi>Greeks,</hi>
that envied the Succeſs of the <hi>Spartans,</hi> ſo that they
were quickly obliged to recall <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
at home. Not long after their Fleet being beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
by <hi>Conon, Epaminondas</hi> defeated their Army by
Land in the Battle of <hi>Leuctra,</hi> whereby they were ſo
weakened, that they were ſcarce able to defend their
own Walls. Next to theſe two Cities, <hi>Thebes</hi> was for

wherein the neighbouring Nations of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon</hi>
were at that time,<note place="margin">The Politick Conduct and great Actions of <hi>Philip.</hi>
                  </note> and the good Conduct of
<hi>Philip,</hi> whereby he ſo ſettled the Kingdom at home,
that it quickly became the chiefeſt in all <hi>Greece,</hi> gave
the firſt opportunity to lay the Foundation of this
Monarchy. For on one ſide it had for its Neighbours
the <hi>Thracians, Triballians,</hi> and <hi>Illyrians,</hi> very barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Nations; theſe were eaſily kept in awe by a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring,
wiſe and brave King. On the other ſide,
was <hi>Greece</hi> and its Cities, which, though they were
much fallen from their ancient Glory, yet, were all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
ſtill too hard for the <hi>Macedonians.</hi> Againſt
thoſe he made uſe of this Artifice, That by ſetting
them together by the Ears among themſelves, he ſo
weakened them with inteſtine Wars, that they were
afterwards not able to hold out long againſt him. And
becauſe <hi>Philip</hi> uſed only to attack one of thoſe Cities
at a time, and the reſt were not forward enough una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly
to hinder his growing Greatneſs, he was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a ſudden, before they were aware of it grown too
ſtrong and potent for them all. <hi>Philip</hi> ſeemed particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
endowed with great qualifications for this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize:
For beſides the Vivacity of his Spirit, he was
puſh'd on by an extraordinary Ambition to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
famous by great Actions. What real Vertues were
wanting in him, he endeavoured to ſupply with preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the ſame; wherefore tho' he did nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a fair Pretence, yet did he never ſtick at any thing,
provided he could obtain his ends, and was never ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
in Promiſes or Oaths, if he thought he could there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
deceive ſuch as he intended to overcome. He was
an abſolute Maſter of his Paſſions, and knew how to
keep his Counſels ſecret, how to ſet Friends together
by the Ears, and by pretending Friendſhips to both
Parties, to deceive them by vain hopes. He being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65650:19"/>
very Eloquent, knew how to inſinuate himſelf with
every body; and as for Money, he made no other uſe
of it, than to advance his deſigns. He was a moſt
experienced Warriour, and had made the <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians</hi>
ſo excellent Souldiers, that the <hi>Macedonian</hi>
Phalanx, firſt invented by him, was terrible, even to
the <hi>Romans.</hi> And, becauſe he was always at the Head
of his Armies, continually exerciſed his Souldiers, and
punctually paid them, there were no better Souldiers,
in his days, than the <hi>Macedonians.</hi> Being arrived to
this Greatneſs, ſo that he was choſen by the common
conſent of <hi>Greece</hi> their General againſt the <hi>Perſians;</hi>
and being buſie in making preparations for this expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
he was barbarouſly murthered, leaving his Son

conquer'd ſo vaſt and potent Kingdoms, and by his
victorious Arms extended his Empire from the <hi>Helle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpont</hi>

that, beſides the Providence of God Almighty, who

Valour of <hi>Alexander</hi> himſelf had a great
ſhare in the ſame; who having an Army of choſen
Men, fell upon his Enemy's Army with ſuch ſwiftneſs
and vigour, that it was impoſſible for any new levied

<hi>Darius</hi> committed a grand miſtake, when he offered

Beſides this, the <hi>Perſians</hi> having lived for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable

ſuch undiſciplined Souldiers, the ſooner were they
brought into diſorder at the time of Battel. <hi>Darius</hi>
was ignorant of that great Art of protracting the War,

off the Proviſions from his Enemies, to take off the

to give him a diverſion at home with the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance

both him and his young Children of the fruits of his

after his Death betwixt his Generals, brought the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd
Nations under great Calamities, who elſe would
have been in hopes to have changed their Kings for
a much better and greater Prince. But that it ſeem'd
was next to an impoſſibility, that theſe ſo ſuddenly

Kingdom. Since a firm Union betwixt ſo many Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
could not be eſtabliſhed without a ſingular Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence

We find alſo that a ſudden Greatneſs is rarely laſting,
there being no leſs ability required to maintain, than
to acquire a thing of this nature. The Conqueſts
therefore of <hi>Alexander</hi> being of ſo vaſt an extent, that
the ſmall number of his <hi>Macedonians</hi> was by no means
ſufficient to keep them in awe; and to make thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
dependent on the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Empire, there
was no other way to maintain ſuch vaſt Conqueſts,
than to treat the conquered Nations in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
with his native Subjects, and not to oblige them
to recede from their ancient Laws and Cuſtoms, or to
turn <hi>Macedonians,</hi> but rather for him to turn <hi>Perſian,</hi>
that the conquered might not be ſenſible of any other
change, but what they found in the Perſon of their
King. <hi>Alexander</hi> underſtood this very well; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he not only uſed himſelf to the <hi>Perſian</hi> Cuſtoms
and Habit, but alſo married the deceaſed King's Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and had a <hi>Perſian</hi> Guard about him. Thoſe Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,

only diſcover their own indiſcretion. But to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
a right underſtanding betwixt the Conquerours

in the World, as being endowed with a more than

                  </note> The Death of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great was
the occaſion of long and bloody Wars; For the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
puff'd up with the Glory of its great Actions,
eſteemed no body worthy of the ſupream Command;
And the Generals refuſing to obey one another, were
grown too potent to live as private perſons. 'Tis time
<hi>Arideus</hi> had the name of King; but this poor Man
wanted both Authority and Power to bridle the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
of ſo many proud and great Men. Wherefore
all ſpurr'd on by their hopes, ſome of obtaining the
whole Empire, ſome of getting a conſiderable ſhare,
they waged a moſt bloody and long War among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
till their number was reduced to a few, from a
great many, who firſt pretended to the Empire. Five
of them took upon themſelves the Title of Kings, and
the Sovereign Dominion of their Provinces, <hi>viz. Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander,
Lyſimachus, Antigonus, Seleucus</hi> and <hi>Ptolemy.</hi>
But only the three laſt tranſmitted their Kingdoms
to their Families. There were then no more than
three Kingdoms remaining in the power of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonians;</hi>
viz. That of <hi>Syria, Egypt</hi> and <hi>Macedon;</hi>
That part of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Empire which lay Eaſterly
beyond the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> being become a vaſt new
Kingdom under the name of the <hi>Parthian</hi> Empire.
The above-mentioned three Kingdoms were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
ſwallowed up by the <hi>Romans,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Fall of the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Empire.</note> and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom

ſo near to them, that in time he might eaſily prove

                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:65650:21"/>
reſtored Liberty to all <hi>Greece.</hi> By which means
the <hi>Romans</hi> at the ſame time divided their Strength,
and gain'd their Affections; at length they Conquer'd
<hi>Perſeus,</hi> and with him the Kingdom of <hi>Macedon:</hi>
Then they turn'd their Arms againſt <hi>Syria,</hi> and took
from <hi>Antiochus</hi> the Great, all that part of <hi>Aſia</hi> which

Kingdom did hold out for a while after, yet being
miſerably torn to pieces by the Diſſentions, which were

King of <hi>Armenia.</hi> But he being Conquered
by <hi>Pompey,</hi> the Whole was made a Province of the

ſomething of <hi>Carthage.</hi> This City having long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted
with <hi>Rome</hi> for the Superiority, ſo that the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Government did not think it ſelf well ſecured, as
long as this City was in Being. This City, though it
was rather fitted for Trade than War; yet having ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
vaſt Riches by its Traffick, and being vaſtly
encreaſed in Power and Inhabitants, forced not only
the next adjacent Countries in <hi>Africa</hi> to pay them
Tribute, but alſo ſent vaſt Armies into <hi>Sicily, Sardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi>
and <hi>Spain.</hi> This occaſioned the Wars betwixt
them and the <hi>Romans;</hi> the two Firſt they maintain'd
with extraordinary Reſolution and Valour, but in
the Third they were brought to utter Deſtruction.
If they had avoided to meddle with the <hi>Roman</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
they might in all probability have been able for
a great while to defend their Liberty. Ambition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
was the chief Cauſe of their Ruin, ſince the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of their Government was ſuch, as being Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apted
for Trade, did not require any great Poſſeſſions,
except a few Lands for the uſe of their Citizens, and
ſome Sea-Ports in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> for conveniency of
Commerce and Shipping. But the Conqueſts of large
Countries were more hurtfull than profitable to them.
For thoſe Generals who Commanded their Armies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
proved at laſt dangerous to them, thinking it
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65650:21"/>
below themſelves after ſo much Glory and vaſt Riches
obtained, to be put in the ſame Rank with their Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Citizens. The Inhabitants beſides, of this City,
were not ſo well fitted for Land-ſervice; ſo that they
being obliged to fill up their Armies with Mercenary
Souldiers, collected out of ſeveral Nations, theſe were
a vaſt and certain Charge to them, the hopes of the
Benefit remaining uncertain. And beſides this, their
Faith was very inconſtant, and the Conquered places
could ſcarce be truſted to thoſe, whoſe Faith might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
be bought by Money. After their firſt War with
the <hi>Romans,</hi> they Experienced almoſt to their utter
Ruin, how dangerous it is to wage War altogether
with Foreign and Mercenary Souldiers. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they could not poſſibly hold out againſt the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
who fought with a much greater Conſtancy for
their Native Country, than theſe Foreign Mercenaries
did for their Pay. 'Twas a Capital Errour in the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians,</hi>
that they did not take care in time, ſo to
Eſtabliſh their Power at Sea, that they needed not to
have feared any thing from the <hi>Romans</hi> that way: But
after they had once let the <hi>Romans</hi> become Maſters at
Sea, they could not but expect them one time or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at their City-gates. At the time when <hi>Hannibal</hi>
had ſuch prodigious Succeſs againſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
alſo a fatal Neglect in them, that they did not
timely ſend freſh Supplies to Re-inforce him, ſo that
he might have proſecuted the War to the Deſtruction
of <hi>Rome.</hi> For after they had once given leiſure to
the <hi>Romans,</hi> to recollect themſelves, they, conſcious
of their former danger, never reſted till they had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<hi>Carthage</hi> to the ground.</p>
               <p>§. 12.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rome</hi> a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like City.</note> It is worth the while to trace the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
of <hi>Rome</hi> back to its Original, becauſe none ever
yet Equall'd it in Power and Greatneſs, and becauſe
young Students are firſt Entred and beſt Read in the
<hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtory. This City was perfectly made for
War, from whence the firſt had her Riſe, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
her Fall. Its firſt Inhabitants were a ſorry
Rabble of Indigent People, the very Dregs of <hi>Italy,</hi>
being ignorant of what belonged to Commerce, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65650:22"/>
not expert in any Handy-craft's Trade. For the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
on of the firſt, <hi>Rome</hi> was not Commodiouſly
Situated; and the Latter was at that time un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
in <hi>Italy.</hi> That ſmall parcel of Ground which
at firſt they had poſſeſs'd themſelves of, was not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to maintain a conſiderable Number of People;
nor was there any vacant Ground in the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
which could be Tilled for their uſe. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they would not always remain Beggars, nothing
was left them but their Swords, wherewith to cut out
their Fortune. And truly <hi>Rome</hi> was nothing elſe but
a Den of Wolves, and its Inhabitants, like Wolves,
always thirſting after their Neighbour's Goods and
Blood, living by continual Robberies. It was then
neceſſary for a City, under theſe Circumſtances, to keep
up a conſtant Stock of Valiant Citizens. To effect
this the better,<note place="margin">Bywhat means <hi>Rome</hi> became ſo populous.</note> 
                  <hi>Romulus</hi> commanded, that no Child
ſhould be kill'd, except ſuch as were very Deformed;
which barbarous Cuſtom was alſo then very common
among the <hi>Grecians.</hi> Beſides this, he ordered that all
Slaves at <hi>Rome,</hi> together with their Liberty, ſhould
have the Privilege of the City, from whom afterwards
deſcended great Families, their Poſterity being ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
by great Deeds, to Efface the Memory of their
baſe Original. But above all, one thing did mightily
contribute towards the Increaſe of <hi>Rome,</hi> that <hi>Romu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>
did not ſuffer the Men to be put to the Sword, in
ſuch places, as were taken by force by the <hi>Romans,</hi>
nor would let them be ſold for Slaves; but receiving
them into <hi>Rome,</hi> granted them the ſame Privileges
with the reſt of the Citizens. The <hi>Roman</hi> Writers
give this for one reaſon, why <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Sparta</hi> could
not ſo long maintain their Conqueſts, as <hi>Rome</hi> did;
ſince they ſeldom Naturalized Strangers; whereas <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus</hi>
frequently uſed to receive the ſame as Citizens
of <hi>Rome</hi> in the Evening, with whom he had fought in
the Morning. For War cannot be carried on without
a good Stock of Men; nor can Conqueſts be maintain'd
without a conſiderable Number of Valiant Souldiers,
upon whoſe Faith the Government can rely in caſe of
an Attack. But that the Conquered places might not
be left deſtitute of Inhabitants, and <hi>Rome</hi> might not
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65650:22"/>
be fill'd up with too much Rabble, they uſed only
to Tranſplant the beſt and richeſt Men of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
places to <hi>Rome,</hi> filling up their places with the
pooreſt of the <hi>Roman</hi> Citizens; who ſetling a continual
good Correſpondence betwixt the Conquered and the
<hi>Romans,</hi> ſerved alſo for a Garriſon in theſe places. By
theſe means the moſt Valiant and Richeſt Inhabitants
of the Neighbouring Countries were drawn to <hi>Rome,</hi>
and the pooreſt among the <hi>Romans</hi> obtained thereby,
in thoſe places, large Poſſeſſions. But although Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
gave an Edge to the <hi>Roman</hi> Valour, 'twas not
that alone that made them ſo War-like a People; for
the Courage of their Kings, who inſtructed them in
Military Affairs, and hardned them to Dangers, had a
great ſhare in it; though, the thing rightly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
it is not always adviſeable, to lay the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a State upon Military Conſtitutions; ſince the
Changes of War are uncertain, and then it is not for
the Quiet of any State that Martial Tempers ſhould
prevail too much in it. Wherefore Peaceable times
did never agree with the <hi>Romans;</hi> and as ſoon as they
were freed from the Danger of Foreign Enemies, they
ſheath'd their Swords in each other's Bowels.</p>
               <p>§. 13. There were alſo other things worth our
Obſervation,<note place="margin">Several other Military Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions.</note> which did greatly advance the Military
Affairs of <hi>Rome.</hi> One of the chiefeſt was, That their
King <hi>Servius Tullius</hi> had ordered, that only the moſt
able and wealthy Citizens ſhould do Service as Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and Equip themſelves either with light Arms or
compleat Armour, according to their Ability: And,
whereas formerly every body, without diſtinction, was
obliged to ſerve the Publick in the Wars at his own
Charge; the poorer ſort afterwards were never made
uſe of, but upon Extraordinary Occaſions. And
though Riches do not make a Man the more Valiant,
yet was it but reaſonable, ſince every body was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to ſerve without Pay, that thoſe, who were ſcarce
able to maintain themſelves, ſhould be ſpared as much
as could be: But beſides this, their Wealth was a
Pledge of their Fidelity. For he that has nothing to
loſe but his Life, carries all along with him, and has
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65650:23"/>
no ſuch ſtrict Obligation to face Death; beſides, that
he may eaſily be brought to deſert his own Party, if
he meets with a proſpect of a better fortune among
the Enemies. On the contrary, a wealthy Man fights
with more Zeal for the Publick Intereſt, becauſe in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
That, he ſecures his own, and is not likely to
betray his Truſt; For if he deſerts, he leaves his Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions
behind him, with uncertain hopes of a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of his Treachery from the Enemy. And, though
this Cuſtom grew out of faſhion under the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
yet, in lieu of that, they always kept part of
their Arrears behind, to aſſure themſelves of their Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity;
and theſe were never paid, till they were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs'd.
It is alſo remarkable, that, though the <hi>Romans</hi>
have been often Signally beaten in the Field, yet did
they never deſpair or accept of any diſadvantageous
Conditions of Peace, except what they did with <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenae,</hi>
and the <hi>Gauls</hi> call'd the Terrour; to the firſt
they were fain to give Hoſtages, upon condition, that
they ſhould not make any Iron-work, except what
was requiſite for Tilling the Ground. Of which
ſhamefull Peace, the <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtorians have cautiouſly
avoided to ſpeak in their Writings. And the <hi>Gauls</hi>
were within an Inch of having put a period to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Being of <hi>Rome,</hi> if they had not been bought off
with Money, to Raiſe the Siege of the <hi>Capitol,</hi> redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to the utmoſt extremity by Famine. For what
is related, that <hi>Camillus</hi> coming up juſt at the time of
the weighing out of the Gold, and drove the <hi>Gauls</hi>
from the Capitol, ſome look upon as a fabulous Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Upon all other occaſions they have always born
their publick Misfortunes with an extraordinary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy.
For, notwithſtanding that <hi>Hannibal</hi> in the
ſecond <hi>Punick</hi> War had reduced them to the laſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity,
yet was not a word of Peace mentioned at
<hi>Rome.</hi> And when their Generals by <hi>Claudius</hi> and
<hi>Numantia</hi> had agreed upon ſhamefull Conditions
with the Enemies, they choſe rather to deliver up the
Generals to the Enemies, than Ratifie the Treaty.
They uſed alſo commonly to have but a ſmall regard,
and rarely to redeem ſuch as were made Priſoners a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, to teach thereby the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers, to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65650:23"/>
expect no deliverance but from their own Swords. As
this Cuſtom did oblige the Souldiers to fight till the
laſt, ſo did their Conſtancy ſtand them in great ſtead
among other Nations. For he that ſhows himſelf
once fearfull of his Enemy, muſt expect to be Attackt
by him, as often as opportunity preſents it ſelf.</p>
               <p>§. 14.<note place="margin">Of the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi>
                  </note> It is alſo worth the while to touch a little
upon the Religion of the Ancient <hi>Romans,</hi> which,
though it was derived from the <hi>Greeks,</hi> yet the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
knew much better how to Accommodate it to
the advantage of their State. It was therefore from
the very beginning a conſtant Rule at <hi>Rome,</hi> not to
begin any publick Affairs of moment, without good
Indications or Preſages: Becauſe that the Event of
things is commonly ſuppoſed to happen according to
the Approbation of God. And therefore ſuch as think
themſelves aſſured of the good Will of God, undertake
and effect things with a greater Courage. Theſe Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
were commonly taken from Birds. Which
being a very ancient Superſtition, which took its Riſe
from an Opinion of the Heathens, that the Gods ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
their place of Reſidence immediately above the
Region of the Air, did make uſe of the Creatures of
the next adjoyning Element for their Interpreters.
Theſe Indications alſo were thought particularly uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
becauſe the ſame were at hand at all times, and
the Motions and Chirpings of the Birds might be vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
interpreted according to the Exigency of the
Times, and the Affairs of the State. The cunning
Augrs or Sooth-ſayers made uſe of theſe Predictions
from the flight of Birds, to inſpire the ignorant Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
either with Hopes or Deſpair, Valour or Fear,
according as it ſeem'd moſt ſuitable and convenient to
the publick Affairs. Wherefore <hi>Cato</hi> the Elder, who
was an Augur himſelf, did not ſtick to ſay; <hi>He did
wonder, how one Augur, meeting another, could forbear
laughing, becauſe their Science was built upon ſo ſlight
a foundation.</hi> What the <hi>Romans</hi> did call Religion,
was chiefly inſtituted for the benefit of the State, that
thereby they might the better be able to Rule the
Minds of the People, according to the Conveniencies
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65650:24"/>
and Exigencies of the State; quite in another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
than the Chriſtian Religion does, which is inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
for the benefit of the Soul, and the future Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
of Mankind. Wherefore there were no certain
Heads or Articles of Religion among the <hi>Romans,</hi>
whence the People might be inſtructed concerning the
Being and Will of God, or how they might regulate
their Paſſions and Actions ſo as to pleaſe God: But
all was involved in outward Ceremonies; <hi>viz.</hi> What
ſort of Sacrifices was to be made, what Holy-days and
Publick Games were to be kept, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For the reſt, the
Prieſts were unconcerned, as to what the People did
believe or not believe of Divine Matters; or, whether
after this Life the Vertuous and Wicked were to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
Rewards according to their ſeveral deſerts; or,
whether the Souls periſh'd together with the Bodies.
For we ſee, that the Heathens have ſpoken very dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
concerning theſe Matters, and the wiſeſt of them
have taken theſe things for Inventions wherewith to
keep the People in awe. But in their Ceremonies they
were moſt exact, performing the ſame with great
pomp and outward ſhow, and rarely admitting of the
leaſt alteration to be made in the ſame. All this was
inſtituted to pleaſe the humour of the Multitude,
which is moſt moved with thoſe things, which dazle
the Eyes, and ſtrike ſtrongly on the Senſes. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their Temples and Sacrifices were not only extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Magnificent, but the Prieſts alſo were choſen
out of the moſt Noble Families, which ſerved to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
the Reverence of the People, that commonly
judges of the Value of things, according to the quality
of ſuch as are employed about them. Yet beſides this,
there was another Myſtery in it. For, becauſe they
made uſe of their Religion only as an Inſtrument of
State, to make the People pliable to the Intentions of
their Rulers; it was by all means neceſſary, that ſuch
Prieſts were made uſe of, as underſtood the Intereſt of
the State, and did themſelves alſo ſit at the Helm of
the Common-wealth. On the contrary, if the meaner
ſort had been employed as Prieſts, they might eaſily,
out of Ambition, have, with the aſſiſtance of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
raiſed a Faction contrary to the Governours, ſince
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65650:24"/>
the Multitude commonly depends on thoſe of whoſe
Sanctity they have an Opinion; or elſe out of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of the publick Affairs and the preſent Exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
they might chance to influence the People in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
manner, than was conſiſtent with the preſent ſtate
of Affairs. They prevented alſo by this way, that the
Prieſts could not form a particular Eſtate in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
and thereby either cauſe a miſchievous
Diviſion, or elſe ſtrive to get the Power into their
own hands.</p>
               <p>§. 15.<note place="margin">The Expulſion of their Kings, and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of a new Form of Government.</note> After <hi>Rome</hi> had been governed for Two
hundred forty and two Years by Kings, another Form
of Government was introduced, <hi>Sextus Tarquin</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
at that time raviſh'd <hi>Lucretia.</hi> Whether <hi>Junius
Brutus</hi> had ſufficient reaſon, upon this account, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
the King, may very well admit of Diſpute. For
on one ſide the Fact was moſt abominable, and of
ſuch a nature, that a brave Man would rather venture
at any thing, than bear ſuch an affront. And there
are a great many Examples, that Princes, who, to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
their brutiſh Luſts, have Violated the Chaſtity of
their Subject's Wives and Daughters, and thereby loſt
both their Lives and Crowns. But on the other hand,
it is to be conſidered, that a Fact, though never ſo
Criminal, committed by a Son, without the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and Conſent of his Father, ought not to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial
to the Father and Family; much leſs could it
be a pretence to depoſe a King from a Throne, which
he lawfully poſſeſſed; Eſpecially, ſince to take Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
of Criminals does belong only to the King,
and not the Subjects. And <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Collatinus</hi>
would have had reaſon to complain, after the King had
denied them juſt ſatisfaction for the Fact committed
by his Son, or if he had in any ways approved of the
ſame. But it is commonly obſerved, that in Revolutions
things are ſeldom carried according to the New form of
the Rules of Juſtice. And as there is commonly ſome
injuſtice committed at the firſt Settlement of a new
Form of Government; ſo Ambition and Envy, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with Pretences of the Faults and Male-Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
of the Prince, are the true Motives of Dethro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65650:25"/>
the ſame. But not to inſiſt further upon this, it
is certain that Kingly Government could not be du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
at <hi>Rome;</hi> For ſuch States as are comprehended
in one great City are more fit for an <hi>Ariſtocratical</hi> or
<hi>Democratical</hi> Form of Government; whereas a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
is fitteſt to be erected in Kingdoms, where the
Subjects are diſperſed in a conſiderable Tract and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of Land. The true Reaſon of this is, That Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
in general, politically conſidered, is like wild un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly
Creatures, ready upon all occaſions to ſhake off
the Bridle of Civil Obedience, as often as Matters do
not ſuit with its humours. Beſides, this Man cannot
be kept in Obedience without the aſſiſtance of Men.
From whence it may rationally be concluded, why a
King, who Commands only over one great populous
City, is immediately in danger of loſing all, as ſoon as
his Subjects are diſguſted at him, or another can inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate
himſelf into their favour, except he is fortified
with a ſtrong Guard of Foreigners, and a conſiderable
Fort; though theſe Remedies are very odious, and
oftentimes very uncertain. For when in ſuch a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
the Prince comes to be odious, the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
is quickly communicated to all his Subjects, as li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
cloſe together, and having conſequently an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of uniting themſelves eaſily againſt him.
But where the Subjects of a Prince live at a diſtance
from one another, it is eaſie for him to keep ſo many
of them inclined to his ſide, as are ſufficient to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
the mutinous Party. Wherefore alſo they are
not ſo much to be feared, as being not able to meet
ſo ſoon, and to unite themſelves in one Body. But it
is more eſpecially very dangerous to Command over
Subjects living in one place, of a fiery Temper, and
exerciſed in Arms. For Common ſenſe tells us, that
he who will controul another, ought to have more
force than him. In the mean while, this is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that this Alteration of the Government mainly
contributed towards the Encreaſe of <hi>Rome;</hi> it being
not credible, that under the Monarchical Government
it could have arrived to that Greatneſs; partly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Kings would have been obliged for their own
ſecurity to ſuppreſs, in ſome meaſure, the Martial Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:65650:25"/>
of their Citizens; partly, becauſe the Negligence
or Unskilfulneſs of ſome Kings muſt needs have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
diſadvantageous to the Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>§. 16. Above all,<note place="margin">Reaſons of the fall of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note> it is worth our Conſideration,
by what means the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, which extended
it ſelf over ſo conſiderable a part of the World, was
deſtroyed, and became a prey to the Northern Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
after it had been broken by its own Inteſtine
Troubles. The Cauſes of which we will enquire into
from their firſt beginning. The People of <hi>Rome</hi> then
being naturally of a fierce and martial Spirit, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed
together within the Walls of one City, their
Kings had no way left to ſecure their Obedience, but
by gaining their Affections with the gentleneſs and
moderation of their Government, ſince they had not
ſufficient Power to balance the Forces of ſo vaſt a City.
Wherefore the ſix firſt Kings kept the People in Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
rather by their good Inclinations than Fear.
But as ſoon as <hi>Tarquin</hi> the Proud began to oppreſs
the People with new Impoſitions, whereby he had ſo
alienated the Hearts of his Subjects from him; it was
eaſie for <hi>Brutus,</hi> under pretext of the Fact committed
upon <hi>Lucretia,</hi> to ſtir up the diſcontented People, and
to ſhut the City-gates againſt the King. But as all
ſudden Changes of Government,<note place="margin">The Defects of the <hi>Roman</hi> Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</note> that are carried on
before things have been maturely conſidered, and all
Emergencies provided againſt, are commonly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with great Defects: So alſo was this at <hi>Rome,</hi>
where ſome things were admitted, and others left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done;
not ſo much becauſe they conduced to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
and ſafety of the State, but becauſe the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Juncture of Affairs would not ſuffer them to be
otherwiſe. There were alſo many Over-ſights com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
in the beginning, which left a Gap open for fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Evils and Troubles. It ſeems to be evident, that
<hi>Brutus</hi> and his Aſſociates, after they had expell'd <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin,</hi>
did intend to introduce an <hi>Ariſtocratical</hi> Form
of Government: For it is ſcarce credible that they,
being Noble-men, with the peril of their Lives ſhould
have expelled <hi>Tarquin</hi> on purpoſe to ſubject them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to the Government of the Common people;
but becauſe no Wiſe man is willing to exchange his
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65650:26"/>
preſent condition with another, without hopes of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
the ſame: Therefore the chief Authors of
this Revolution were obliged, not only to render the
Kingly Government odious to the People, but alſo by
Mildneſs and Conceſſions to make the People in love
with the New Government. For if the Common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
had not been made ſenſible of the benefit they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from the Government of the Nobility, they
might eaſily have opened the Gates again to <hi>Tarquin.</hi>
Wherefore <hi>Valerius Papicola</hi> did ſtrive to pleaſe the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
eſpecially in letting down the Rods or <hi>Faſces</hi> (the
Enſigns of Authority) before them, and allowing Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals
to the People, as a tacit Confeſſion that the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Power of <hi>Rome</hi> did belong to them. It was by
all means requiſite, if the Noble-men did intend to
maintain the newly acquired Authority, to have a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
care of theſe two things. Firſt, To take heed
that they did not exaſperate the Common people
with their Pride; And, Secondly, To find Means to
maintain the poorer ſort, that they might not be
forced to ſeek for Remedies againſt their Poverty and
Debts by diſturbing the Publick. But neither of them
were ſufficiently regarded by the Nobility. There be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at that time no written Laws at <hi>Rome,</hi> and the
Nobility being in poſſeſſion of all publick Offices, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
was oftentimes adminiſtred according to Favour
and Affection, the poorer ſort being often, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly,
oppreſſed by the more Powerfull. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Citizens were obliged to ſerve in the Wars
at their own Charge at that time, when little was to
be got, they were thereby miſerably exhauſted; ſo
that they had no other remedy left them but to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
Money from the Richer ſort. Theſe uſed ſuch as
were not able to ſatisfie their Creditors in ſo barbarous
a manner, by Impriſoning, laying of them in Chains,
and other Cruelties, that the Commons, quite put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
deſpair, unanimouſly retired out of the City; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
could they be perſuaded to return, before the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
had agreed to conſtitute Magiſtrates, called <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes
of the People,</hi> who were to protect the Commons
againſt the Power of the Nobility.</p>

§. 17.<note place="margin">Two diſtinct Bodies in <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </note> This was the Original and Cauſe of the
Diviſion of the <hi>Romans</hi> into two Factions; <hi>viz.</hi> One
of the Nobility, and the Other two Parties of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
people: The continual Jealouſies of which did
afterwards miniſter perpetual fewel for Civil Diſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
It ſeem'd at firſt ſight but equitable and of no
great conſequence, that the Commons might have
for their Heads ſome, who could upon all occaſions
protect them againſt the Nobility: But in this the
Nobles did commit a grand Errour, that they allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Common people, which made the major
part of the City, a protection independent of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate;
making thereby the Body of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
as it were double-headed.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Factious</hi> Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes.</note> For the <hi>Tribunes,</hi>
ſpurr'd on by Ambition, and the Hatred, which is
common in the <hi>Plebeians</hi> againſt the Nobility, were
not ſatisfied with affording their Protection to the
People againſt the Nobility; but alſo were always
endeavouring to be equal in Power, nay even to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs
the Senate in Authority. And firſt by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
Conteſts they obtained a Privilege for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
to intermarry with the Nobles; Afterwards they
forced alſo the Nobility to conſent that one of the
Conſuls ſhould be choſen out of the Commonalty.
They took upon themſelves the Power of a Negative
Voice, ſo as that no Decree of the Senate could paſs
into a Law without their conſent, nay and even with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the conſent of the Senate to make Laws, and to
exerciſe the other Acts of Sovereign Authority. The
Senate, 'tis true, to divert and employ the People,
continually engaged them in one War or another,
that they might not have leiſure to contrive any
thing againſt the Government. This, though it did
very well for a while, and the Power and Territories
of <hi>Rome</hi> were mightily thereby encreaſed, yet did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe
from thence ſome other inconveniencies, which
did not a little contribute towards the indiſpoſition
of the State. For whereas the conquered Lands ought
to have been given to the poorer ſort of the people,
whereby the City would have been freed from a great
many needy Citizens; the Nobles, under pretence of
Farming the ſame, took them into their own poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65650:27"/>
and what with theſe Revenues, and the great
Booty which fell in the Wars almoſt all to their
ſhare, as being Commanders in Chief, the Riches of
the Nobles encreaſed prodigiouſly; whereas a great
many of the <hi>Plebeians</hi> had ſcarce wherewithall to
maintain themſelves. The Commonalty being for
theſe Reaſons extreamly diſſatisfied with the Senate,
there were not wanting ſome of the Nobility, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
of an ambitious Spirit, who having taken di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſte
at ſome Tranſactions of the Senate, did, under
pretence of maintaining the Liberties of the People,
make a conſiderable Party among them, though, in
effect, their chief aim was, with the aſſiſtance of the
<hi>Plebeians,</hi> to carry on their ambitious deſigns. Thoſe
being by force oppoſed by the Senate, it came quickly
to a Civil War, and they ſheath'd their Swords in
each other's Bowels.</p>
               <p>§. 18. In the mean time,<note place="margin">Citizens too powerfull.</note> partly by the vaſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, partly by Inadvertency
of the Senate, another Evil had taken root; <hi>viz.</hi> That
vaſt and rich Provinces, together with great Armies,
were committed to the Government of ſome of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Citizens, and that for ſeveral years. From
which, as it created in them an averſion to a private
life, ſo it gave an opportunity to have whole Armies
at their Devotion. It is not adviſeable for any State
whatſoever to let any of its Citizens mount to that
degree of Power. For he that has a potent Army at
his Devotion, will ſcarce be able to reſiſt the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but will be apt to attempt to make himſelf So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign.
It is evident that the Ambition and great
Power of <hi>Marius, Sulla, Pompey</hi> and <hi>Caeſar</hi> did ſpur
them on, by Inteſtine Wars, to ſuppreſs the Liberty of
their native Country; and after <hi>Rome</hi> was quite bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by them, to introduce an alteration in its Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
There was ſcarce any remedy left againſt this
Evil, after the Citizens had once laid aſide the reſpect
due to the Senate, and the Souldiers had taſted the
Sweets of the Booty got by Civil Commotions. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this Common-wealth at the very time when it
was arrived to the pitch of its Greatneſs, it return'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:65650:27"/>
to a Monarchy, but not of the beſt kind, where
the Army exerciſed Sovereign Authority.<note place="margin">The Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy.</note> 
                  <hi>Auguſtus</hi>
was the firſt Founder of this Monarchy, which he by
his wife and long Reign, ſeem'd to have eſtabliſh'd
pretty well: And truly this new introduc'd form of
Government, did for a while promiſe very fair, ſince
<hi>Auguſtus</hi> aſſum'd only the Title of Prince, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the Senate and the reſt of the great Officers in
their Stations, took upon himſelf no more than the
adminiſtration of Military Affairs. But in effect, this
Monarchy was not founded ſo much upon the conſent
of the Senate and People, as upon the Power of the
Souldiery, by whoſe aſſiſtance it was introduc'd and
maintain'd. And becauſe the ancient Nobility could
not brook to be commanded by one ſingle perſon,
and was always for recovering its former Liberty, the
Emperours left no Stone unturn'd either to diminiſh,
or quite to extinguiſh the Splendour of the ancient
Nobility; ſo that within the ſpace of 200 Years, very
few were left, in whoſe places new Favourites of the
Emperours were created, who were willing to ſubmit
themſelves to their Commands.</p>
               <p>§. 19. But this Monarchy being founded upon the
Souldiery,<note place="margin">The <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy could not be of a long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance.</note> could not be of a long continuance; for as
ſoon as the Souldiers had once learn'd this Secret, that
they being the Supporters of the Monarchy, could
diſpoſe of the Empire at pleaſure, and that the Senate
and People were now empty Names; the Emperours
were not only oblig'd with double Pay and great
Preſents to purchaſe their Favour; but they alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to kill ſuch Emperours as were not pleaſing to
them, and to fill up their room with ſuch as could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
their Favour. And becauſe one Army did claim
the ſame Prerogative as well as the other, not only
the <hi>Pretorian</hi> Bands, but alſo other Armies, which
were on the Frontiers, undertook to do the ſame.
Hence came nothing but Miſery and Confuſion in the
<hi>Roman</hi> Empire, the Life of each Emperour depending
on the Will of the covetous and unruly Souldiers, ſo
that no Emperour was aſſur'd to leave the Empire to
his Poſterity. Oftentimes the braveſt Princes were
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65650:28"/>
murther'd, and in their room others ſet up of the
meaneſt Rank and Capacity. Oftentimes two or
more were declared Emperours, who uſed to make
horrid ſlaughters among the Citizens in deciding their
Titles to the Empire. And this was the reaſon why
not only very few of the ancient Emperours died a
natural death, but alſo the Power of this vaſt Empire,
was diminiſh'd to that degree by theſe inteſtine Wars,
that it did appear no otherwiſe than a Body without
its Nerves. <hi>Conſtantine the Great</hi> did alſo haſten its
fall, when he transferr'd the Imperial Court from
<hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and ſent away the Veterane
Legions which guarded the Frontiers of the Empire,
along the <hi>Danube</hi> and the <hi>Rhine,</hi> to the Eaſterly
Parts, whereby the Weſtern Provinces, deſtitute of
their Guards, became a prey to other Nations. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
this, <hi>Theodoſius</hi> divided the Empire betwixt his
two Sons, giving to <hi>Arcadius</hi> the <hi>Eaſtern,</hi> to <hi>Honorius</hi>
the <hi>Weſtern</hi> parts; which diviſion did not a little
contribute towards the deſtruction of the Empire.
The <hi>Weſtern</hi> Parts became a prey to the <hi>Germans</hi> and
<hi>Goths,</hi> who about that time came in prodigious num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
to change their poor Habitations for the pleaſant
and rich Provinces of the <hi>Romans. England</hi> the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
left of their own accord, as being not in a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city

for their Troops to defend <hi>France. Spain</hi> fell to

                  <note place="margin">Major.</note> a great Misfortune happened at
Home. He had particularly recommended to the
Care of his Queen a very fine Horſe, which <hi>Garſias,</hi>
her Eldeſt Son, had a mind to have, and would have
obtained it from the Mother, if the Maſter of the Horſe
had not oppoſed it, telling them, that his Father would
be greatly diſpleaſed at it. This denial wrought ſo
upon the Son, that he accuſed his Mother of commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Adultery with the Maſter of the Horſe. The
Matter being examined, the King's Natural Son, <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirus,</hi>
profered to juſtifie the Innocency of the Queen
in a Duel with <hi>Garſias,</hi> and the King being uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

whereupon <hi>Garſias</hi> being declared incapable of
ſucceeding his Father in <hi>Caſtile,</hi> which did belong to
him by his Mother's ſide, and <hi>Ramirus</hi> obtained the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion

died in the Year 1158,<note place="margin">Alfonſo IX.</note> leaving his Son <hi>Alfonſo</hi>
IX. a Child of four years of Age. During the time
of his Minority, there were great Diſturbances in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile,</hi>
occaſioned partly by the Diviſions among the
Nobility, partly by the Wars with <hi>Ferdinando</hi> of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and <hi>Sanctius</hi> of <hi>Navarre,</hi> who took ſeveral Places
from the <hi>Caſtilians.</hi> But coming to his riper years,
he did extricate himſelf, though not without great
difficulty, out of thoſe Troubles. In the War againſt
the <hi>Moors,</hi> who always kept the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Kings in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe,
he ſuffered extreamly, ſo that he was obliged
to make a Truce with them, becauſe the Kings of
<hi>Navarre</hi> and <hi>Leon</hi> at the ſame time fell upon him.
At laſt there was a Confederacy made betwixt theſe
Kings, with a certain agreement, how ſuch Places
ſhould be diſpoſed of as ſhould be taken from the
<hi>Moors.</hi> In the Year 1210, a moſt Memorable Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
was undertaken againſt the <hi>Moors,</hi> where pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
themſelves a great many Foreigners, who came
to Signalize themſelves; but a great many of them
being ſoon tired out, returned home. At that time
was fought the famous Battle of <hi>Laſa,</hi> where 200000

of <hi>Leon</hi> took <hi>Alcantara. Alfonſo</hi> died in the Year 1214,

great diſturbances in the Kingdom; he died

<hi>Philip Auguſtus,</hi> King of <hi>France:</hi> The ſecond, <hi>Beren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garia,</hi>
was Married to <hi>Alfonſo,</hi> King of <hi>Leon.</hi> The
Crown, by Right of Succeſſion, did belong to the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt,
and her Heirs: But out of a hatred the States
bore to Strangers, they conferr'd the Kingdom upon
<hi>Ferdinand,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ferdinandus Sanctus.</note> Sir-named <hi>the Holy,</hi> Son of <hi>Berengaria,</hi> who

with all ſpeed imaginable, poſſeſs'd himſelf of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he could be prevented by his Father, ſurmount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all the difficulties which were rais'd againſt him,
partly by his Father, partly by ſome of the Nobility.
It is related by ſome, That <hi>Blanch</hi> was not the eldeſt
Siſter, but that ſome of the <hi>Caſtilian</hi> Noblemen did
diſpute the right of <hi>Berengaria</hi> to the Crown, becauſe
the Pope had declar'd her marriage with <hi>Alfonſo</hi> void,
and their Children illegitimate, as being too near in
Bloud.<note place="margin">1230.</note> By the death of <hi>Alfonſo, Leon</hi> and <hi>Caſtile</hi>

<hi>Moors</hi> ſuffer'd extreamly in their Affairs.<note place="margin">1230.</note> King <hi>James</hi>
of <hi>Arragon</hi> took from them <hi>Majorca,</hi> in the Year
1232. <hi>Minorca</hi> in the Year 1234. <hi>Yvica</hi> in the
Year 1238. The City and Kingdom of <hi>Valencia.

               <p>§. 7.<note place="margin">Alfonſo X.</note> The Hiſtory of the next following Years is
full of Troubles and Diviſions. <hi>Alfonſo,</hi> 'tis true,
was famous in foreign Countries for his Wiſdom and
great skill in Aſtronomy, ſo that it is reported of him,
that he uſed to ſay, <hi>That if God would have adviſed
with him at the time of the Creation of the World, the
World ſhould have been made more uniform;</hi> yet he
was unfortunate at home, and hated by his Subjects.
The firſt occaſion of which was, that he being deſirous
to fill his Treaſury, which was exhauſted, he caus'd
the current Coin to be diminiſh'd, which enhanc'd the
price of every thing, and whilſt to prevent this, he
ſet certain rates on all Commodities,<note place="margin">1256.</note> which occaſion'd
a general ſcarcity of all things, the people not being
willing to ſell at his rates. He was by ſome of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors
choſen <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour, but becauſe his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
were then very young, and great Diviſions aroſe
among his Nobles, he delay'd for a great many Years
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:65650:34"/>
to go thither, and to receive the Imperial Crown, till
in the Year 1275, a fancy took him all on a ſudden,
to go and take poſſeſſion of the Empire, though <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolf</hi>
of <hi>Habsburgh</hi> was already got into the Imperial
Throne. But his Journey was ended in <hi>Provence,</hi> he
returning from thence home by the perſuaſion of the
Pope, who afterwards excommunicated him, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
him alſo to renounce the Title of Emperour.
After the death of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> his eldeſt Son, <hi>Sanctius,</hi>
the younger Brother, did aim at the Succeſſion, tho
<hi>Ferdinand</hi> had left Children behind him. This rais'd
a Jealouſie betwixt the Father and Son, who roſe in

To remove this ſhame, and to exclude <hi>Joan</hi>

But with the <hi>French,</hi> during his whole Life, he
waged continual Wars. For, though in the Year 1516,
he made a League with King <hi>Francis</hi> I. whereby the
Daughter of <hi>Francis</hi> was promiſed to him in Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age;
yet was this Tie not ſtrong enough to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold

<hi>Charles,</hi> who was fluſh'd up with the great Succeſs of

But <hi>Francis,</hi> who was ſurrounded every-where

Charles</hi> alſo did intend to drive the <hi>French</hi>

pretending that <hi>Francis</hi> had neglected to receive this
Dutchy in fief of the Empire, beat the <hi>French</hi> near <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coque.
Fonterabie</hi> alſo, which they had taken by ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize,
was re-taken by force from the <hi>French.</hi> It pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

                  <note place="margin">1524.</note> beſieged <hi>Marſeilles;</hi> Which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
he was forced to quit, as ſoon as <hi>Francis</hi>
march'd with all his Forces that way into <hi>Italy</hi> to
recover the <hi>Milaneze.</hi> Where he took the City of
<hi>Milan,</hi> but at the Siege of <hi>Pavia</hi> was Attack'd by the
Imperial Generals, who totally routed his Army; and
having taken him Priſoner,<note place="margin">1525.</note> carried him into <hi>Spain.</hi>
The King himſelf was in part the occaſion of this loſs,

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:65650:39"/>
were moſt <hi>Italians, Swiſs</hi> and <hi>Griſons,</hi> who did not
perform their Duty in the Battle; and moſt of his
Generals were of opinion, to avoid the hazard of a
Battle, by retiring under the City of <hi>Milan.</hi> The
<hi>French</hi> alſo ſucceeded ill in the Diverſion, which they
endeavour'd to give the Emperour; for by the help of
<hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Geldres,</hi> and the <hi>Friſelanders,</hi> for
they were at that time worſted by <hi>Charles</hi>'s Forces.
There were ſome that adviſed <hi>Charles,</hi> to ſet <hi>Francis</hi>
at liberty without any Ranſome, and by this Act of
Generoſity to oblige him for ever: But he followed
the Counſels of ſuch as did adviſe to make advantage
of ſo great a Priſoner. He therefore impoſed very
hard Conditions upon him, which <hi>Francis</hi> refuſing to
accept of, out of diſcontent fell into a dangerous Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
ſo that <hi>Charles</hi> himſelf went to viſit and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort

his Chancellour <hi>Gallinaca,</hi> who alledged that ſuch a
Viſit, where he did not intend to promiſe the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
his liberty, would rather ſeem to proceed from
Covetouſneſs, and fear of loſing the advantage of his
Ranſome, than from any civility or good inclination
towards him. And this Sickneſs was the real cauſe,
why at laſt the Treaty, concerning his Liberty, which
had been ſo long on foot, was finiſh'd, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
fearing that his Diſcontent might plunge him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
another Sickneſs, or Death it ſelf. In the mean
time, the prodigious Succeſs which attended the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,

To prevent this Storm, and eſpecially to withdraw the
Pope from the Confederacy, the Emperour's Generals
marched directly againſt <hi>Rome,</hi> which they took by
Storm, (where <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Bourbon</hi> was ſlain,) and for
ſeveral days together plunder'd the City, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
great Out-rages. The Pope himſelf was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged

reſtoring the Kingdom of <hi>Tunis</hi> to <hi>Muleaſſa,</hi> who was

But the Emperour, who was reſolved to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex

the Emperour, againſt the advice of his friends, ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured
to take his way through the very heart of

had he before by the Conneſtable <hi>Anna Montmorancy,</hi>
cajolled <hi>Francis</hi> into a belief, that he would reſtore to
him the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> which however he never
intended to perform. In the Year 1541, he undertook

therefore, with an Army of 50000 men, beat

enter'd into <hi>Campaigne,</hi> taking by force <hi>Lygny</hi> and

of the River <hi>Marne,</hi> and not daring to fight the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts,
contented himſelf to ravage the Country
which they were to march through, to endeavour to cut
off their Proviſions: Nevertheleſs the Imperial Army
found a ſufficient quantity at <hi>Eſpernay</hi> and <hi>Chaſteau

in <hi>Paris,</hi> that the Citizens were for leaving the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
if the King, by his Preſence, had not encourag'd
them to ſtay. And if, on the other ſide, King <hi>Henry</hi>
had acted according to the Agreement, they might
eaſily have got the <hi>French</hi> Army betwixt them, and
in all likelyhood, would have put a period to the
<hi>French</hi> Greatneſs. But <hi>Henry</hi> being detain'd at the

Emperour, That he would not ſtir further, till he had
made himſelf Maſter of theſe two places. <hi>Charles</hi>
then began to ſuſpect the King of <hi>England,</hi> whom he

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:65650:41"/>

betwixt Duke <hi>Maurice</hi> and his Couſin, the
Elector of <hi>Saxony;</hi> and refuſing to fight with them
at firſt, he thereby protracted the War, foreſeeing,
that a Confederacy under ſo many Heads would not
laſt long, and that the Cities, which contributed the
moſt towards it, would grow quickly weary of the
Charges of the War. <hi>Francis</hi> alſo, and <hi>Henry</hi> VIII.
were both of them lately dead, who elſe, queſtionleſs,
with all their Power, would have oppos'd his deſigns
of oppreſſing the Proteſtants, thereby to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf

the Proteſtant League did greatly contribute to their
own Misfortune, they having let ſlip ſeveral opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
eſpecially, at firſt, before the Emperour had right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſettled his Matters, when they might have done
him conſiderable miſchief; nevertheleſs <hi>Charles</hi> was no
great gainer by theſe Victories, becauſe he uſed the
Conquer'd, whom he was not able to keep in Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
by force, with too much rigour, keeping the
Captive Princes in too cloſe an Impriſonment. He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo

ſurrender'd himſelf to the Emperour. The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector
therefore being perſuaded by the Prayers of his
Children and others, who objected to him, That by
his Aſſiſtance their Religion and Liberty were in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

forc'd to retire from <hi>Inspruck.</hi> After this exploit a

The Emperour attackt <hi>Metz</hi> again with great fury,
but having been fain to leave it after a conſiderable
loſs ſuſtain'd, he diſcharg'd his Fury upon <hi>Heſdin</hi> and
<hi>Tervanne,</hi> which he levell'd with the Ground. In <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly</hi>

§. 11.<note place="margin">Philip II.</note> Under the Reign of <hi>Philip</hi> II. the greatneſs
of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy began to be at a ſtand; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had its Kings the ſame ſucceſs, as formerly, to
get vaſt Kingdoms by Marriages. For from the match
of <hi>Philip</hi> with <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>England,</hi> came no
Children. And truly, in my Opinion, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Greatneſs receiv'd the firſt ſhock at that time, when
<hi>Charles</hi> V. ſurrender'd his Dominions in <hi>Germany</hi> to
his Brother <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and afterwards had him elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
King of the <hi>Romans;</hi> by which means the Power
of this Houſe was divided, and the Imperial Crown
ſeparated from the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy. <hi>Charles</hi> would
fain have afterwards perſuaded <hi>Ferdinand</hi> to transfer
the Succeſſion of the Imperial Crown upon <hi>Philip;</hi>
but he being perſuaded by his Son <hi>Maximilian</hi> to
keep what he had got, would in no ways part with it.
He was alſo much belov'd by the <hi>Germans,</hi> whereas
they had an averſion againſt <hi>Philip;</hi> who being a
meer <hi>Spaniard,</hi> did not as much as underſtand the
<hi>German</hi> Tongue: And <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and his Succeſſours
prov'd very good Princes, who were not fond of the
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> methods of Governing. But that which gave
the greateſt ſhock to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Greatneſs, were the
Troubles ariſen in the <hi>Netherlands.</hi> The reaſon why
this Evil grew incurable, was, becauſe <hi>Philip</hi> being over
fond of his eaſe, would rather ſit ſtill in <hi>Spain,</hi> than by
his Preſence endeavour to ſtop the current before it ran
too violent, tho' his Father did not think it too much,
to venture himſelf at the Diſcretion of <hi>Francis</hi> his
Rival, to appeaſe the Tumults ariſen only in the City
of <hi>Ghent.</hi> Another reaſon was, That he took the
moſt violent courſe, by ſending the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> a
cruel Man, among the <hi>Netherlunders,</hi> who being us'd
to a mild ſort of Government, were thereby put into
deſpair; eſpecially when they were inform'd, That
the Inquiſition had declar'd Criminal, not only thoſe
who were guilty of the Rebellion, and pulling down
the Images, but alſo all ſuch Catholicks as had not
made reſiſtance againſt them. The Saying of <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Vargas,</hi> a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſter, is a famous as ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous;
<hi>Haeretici diruerunt templa, boni nihil fecerunt
contra, ergo omnes debent patibulari;</hi> i. e. <hi>The Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:65650:42"/>
demoliſh'd the Churches, the Catholicks did not
oppoſe them, wherefore they ought all to be hang'd.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
this, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were much hated by the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlanders,</hi>
not only becauſe of the great differences
there was betwixt the Manners of theſe Nations, but
alſo, becauſe theſe latter had been in great eſteem with
<hi>Charles</hi> V. who was very like them in all his Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour:
On the contrary, <hi>Philip</hi> only encourag'd the
<hi>Spaniards,</hi> who having an extraordinary conceit of
their own Abilities, and taking the <hi>Netherlanders</hi> for
Cowards, did not think they had Courage enough
to oppoſe their Deſigns. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> alſo were well
pleas'd to ſee the <hi>Netherlanders</hi> to begin firſt, hoping
the King would thereby take an opportunity to clip
their Privileges, and by making them all alike obtain
an abſolute Dominion over them: This done, they
hoped to make theſe Countries their Armory and
Store-houſe, from whence they might with more eaſe
invade <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> and raiſe the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
to the higheſt degree of Greatneſs. But the
<hi>Netherlanders,</hi> on the other ſide, were reſolv'd not to
part with their Liberty, nor to be treated as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd
Nation. And when <hi>Philip,</hi> at his departure,
would leave <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Garriſons in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and
to ſoften the matter, conſtituted the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>
and Earl of <hi>Egmont,</hi> Generals over them, yet could
they not be perſuaded to accept of the ſame, alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
That the <hi>Netherlanders</hi> had got but very ſmall
Advantages by the Peace with <hi>France,</hi> which they
had procur'd by their own Valour, if they now ſhould
be in danger of being ſubdu'd themſelves by a foreign
Power. The neighbouring Princes alſo, but eſpecially
<hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Queen of <hi>England,</hi> took an opportunity by
theſe troubles to empty the vaſt Treaſures of <hi>Spain,</hi>
and to exhauſt its Strength. The Proteſtant Princes
alſo of <hi>Germany,</hi> who hated the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> were glad
of this opportunity, and aſſiſted the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>
upon all occaſions. And the Emperours thought it
more convenient to be at quiet and to pleaſe the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
than to be too forward to aſſiſt their Couſins.
Theſe Commotions in the <hi>Netherlands</hi> did alſo occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
the War betwixt <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>

the famous <hi>Francis Drake</hi> plunder'd the very Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
Coaſt of <hi>America.</hi> On the other ſide, <hi>Philip,</hi>
by ſupporting the Rebels in <hi>Ireland,</hi> proved very
troubleſome to Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> At laſt <hi>Philip</hi> did
reſolve with one ſtroke to put down the whole
Strength of <hi>England;</hi> to which purpoſe he was equip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
a great Fleet for ſeveral Years together, which he
call'd <hi>The Invincible,</hi> the like never had been ſeen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

Ships, which carried 1600 great pieces of Braſs Cannon,
and 1050 of Iron; 8000 Seamen, 20000 Souldiers,
beſides Volunteers; the Charge amounted daily to
30000 Ducats, but the whole Preparations to twelve
Milions of Ducats. The Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> V. alſo excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> aſſigning her Kingdom
to <hi>Philip.</hi> But all theſe Preparations came to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
the greateſt part of this Fleet being deſtroy'd,<note place="margin">The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Armado de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.</note>

ſo that there was ſcarce a Noble Family in

much to be admir'd in <hi>Philip,</hi> who receiv'd this bad

the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> after he had plunder'd it,
to the great diſhonour of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who might
from thence have done a great deal of miſchief to the
<hi>Spaniards.</hi> Neither did <hi>Spain</hi> get any advantage by
having entangled it ſelf in the Troubles, and (as it
was call'd) <hi>the holy League,</hi> made in <hi>France. Philip,</hi>
'tis true, propos'd to himſelf to have met with a fair

Diviſions in this Kingdom to ſwallow up one piece or
another, or to aſſiſt one of his Creatures in obtaining
that Crown; or, at leaſt, by dividing it into ſo many
Factions, ſo to weaken its Strength, as that it ſhould
not be able to recover it ſelf for a conſiderable time.
But by the Courage and good Fortune of <hi>Henry</hi> IV.
all theſe Meaſures were broke, and he declaring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
a Catholick, took away the Foundation whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the League was built. Thus <hi>Philip</hi> loſt his vaſt

recover'd <hi>Fere</hi> from the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> In the Year 1597,
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> took <hi>Amiens</hi> by ſurpriſe, which <hi>Henry</hi>
recover'd not without great difficulty. At laſt, a
Peace was concluded in the ſame Year betwixt <hi>France</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Peace made at <hi>Vervin.</hi>

In the Year 1571 the Confederate Fleet of <hi>Spain,
Venice,</hi> and other <hi>Italian</hi> States, under the Command
of <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> did obtain a moſt ſignal Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
over the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Fleet near <hi>Lepanto,</hi> whereby
the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Naval Strength was weaken'd to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
that they were never afterwards ſo formidable in
thoſe Seas, as they were before: But elſe the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
had got no great Reputation in this War; for by their
delays that conſiderable Iſland of <hi>Rhodes</hi> was loſt before.
In the Year 1573 <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> paſs'd with an
Army into <hi>Africa,</hi> to retake <hi>Tunis,</hi> which ſucceeded
ſo well, that he forc'd the City, and added a new Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
to it: But in the Year next following, the <hi>Turks</hi>
ſent a puiſſant Army thither, and retook the City, its
Fortifications being not quite perfected, as alſo <hi>Goletta,</hi>
which being not very well provided with all Neceſſaries,
was loſt by the unskilfulneſs and Cowardice of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour;
ſo that the whole Kingdom of <hi>Tunis,</hi> to the
great prejudice of the Chriſtians, fell into the Hands
of the <hi>Turks.</hi> At home <hi>Philip</hi> had a War with the
<hi>Marans</hi> of <hi>Granada,</hi> who rebelling againſt him, were
ſupported by the <hi>Algerines,</hi> and could not be ſubdu'd
but with great difficulty; and if the <hi>Turks</hi> had been
quick enough in giving them timely aſſiſtance, it
might have prov'd very dangerous to <hi>Spain.</hi> This
Rebellion did not end till the Year 1570, after it had
continued for three years.<note place="margin">1592.</note> There were alſo ſome Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions
among the <hi>Arragonians;</hi> who pretended to
take part with <hi>Anthony Perez,</hi> who ſtanding upon his
privilege againſt the Proceſs that was made him for
having upon the King's Orders, murther'd <hi>Eſcovedo,</hi>
an intimate Friend of <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria. Philip,</hi>
by this intended to purge himſelf of the Infamy of the
fact, and at once to revenge himſelf upon <hi>Perez,</hi>
who had been unfaithfull to him in ſome Love In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue,
aiming at that himſelf which he had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
to procure for the King. And tho this did not
much redound to the honour of <hi>Philip,</hi> yet by this he
took an opportunity to retrench the Privileges of the
<hi>Arragonians.</hi> In the Year 1568, <hi>Philip</hi> caus'd his Son
<hi>Charles</hi> to be kill'd, under pretence that he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd
to kill his Father; and not long after, the

Queen <hi>Iſabella</hi> alſo, <hi>Charles</hi>'s Step-mother, died, not
without ſuſpicion of having been poiſon'd. But a
great many are of opinion, that ſome Love Intrigues
were the occaſion of their death, which is the more
probable, becauſe the ſaid <hi>Iſabella</hi> being intended for

                  <hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>Portugal</hi> dying,

the Iſland of <hi>Tercera</hi> held out for ſome time longer,

Maſter, both of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> the two

the <hi>French, Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Hollanders</hi> had found out a
way to eaſe him of theſe prodigious Revenues. For
<hi>Philip,</hi> juſt before his death, did confeſs, That the
War with the <hi>Netherlands</hi> only, had coſt him 564
Millions of Ducats. And truly, it is very probable,
that truſting to his vaſt Riches he was thereby
prompted to his ambitious Deſigns, and to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
more than prov'd beneficial to him. He died

                  <hi>Philip</hi> the IIId's Father had left him the

grew every day the heavier upon the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> The
<hi>Spaniards</hi> did hope, that after <hi>Philip</hi> II. in his latter
days had married his Daughter <hi>Clara Eugenia</hi> to <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi>

and reunite themſelves with the reſt of the Provinces

own, and not liable to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Government. But
becauſe the <hi>Hollanders</hi> did by no means like this bait,
and at the Siege of <hi>Oſtend</hi> gave a taſt to the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi>

in hopes to make a conſiderable Diverſion, and to

was brought too low, the <hi>French</hi> would thereby be
enabled to ſwallow up the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and become
their immediate Neighbours, which they foreſaw
would prove fatal to their State. It was alſo alledged,
and that with good reaſon, That it was time to put up
the Sword, when all thoſe things might be obtained
by fair means for which it was drawn at firſt; and
that the Province of <hi>Holland</hi> had contracted conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Debts. <hi>Spain</hi> alſo perceiving, that the <hi>Dutch</hi>
were not to be overcome by force, was willing to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
to thoſe Conditions, being glad to be rid once of
ſo troubleſome an Enemy, that they might have the
more leiſure to be even with <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Portugal.</hi> It
is reported, that this War coſt the <hi>Spaniards</hi> above
One thouſand five hundred Millions of Ducats. In
the Year 1628, <hi>Vincent</hi> II. Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> dying,
the Emperour endeavour'd to exclude <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of

In the Year 1635, the <hi>French</hi> denounced War

that they had driven the <hi>French</hi> Garriſon out of <hi>Treves,</hi>
and poſſeſs'd themſelves of that City; but the true
reaſon was, that it was thought high time to bridle
the Ambition and Power of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi>
which after the Battel of <hi>Nordlingen,</hi> and the Peace

by mildneſs, and by preſerving their Privileges, to

<hi>Caſtilians,</hi> which were grown to that height, that the
Prieſts uſed to inſert it in their Prayers, <hi>That God would
be pleaſed to deliver them from the</hi> Caſtilian <hi>Yoak:</hi>
But after his death the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſters had not been
ſo carefull by maintaining their Privileges, to keep
the affection of the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> but rather had treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them as a conquered Nation; which ſo exaſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

Obedience. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> therefore thought it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeable,
that to bridle this People, nothing could be
more proper, than by employing the Nobles as well as

ill Humours of this Nation. In the mean while the
<hi>Catalonians</hi> falling into Rebellion, the <hi>Portugueſe</hi>
Nobles were ordered to go into the Field, which they
did not reliſh well; having beſides this, ſome other
reaſons to be diſſatisfy'd with the <hi>Spaniards:</hi> And, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> had a great affection for the

               <p>§. 15.<note place="margin">The Nature of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
                  </note> Having thus given a brief Hiſtory of the
Kingdom of <hi>Spain,</hi> we will alſo add ſomething con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Genius of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and the extent of
their Territories, as alſo of the Strength and Weakneſs
of this Kingdom, and its Condition in reference to its
Neighbours: The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Nation therefore is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
eſteem'd to be very wiſe, and to take remote
proſpects, throughly weighing a thing before it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes
it. Whereby, nevertheleſs the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
overcautious and exact in their Counſels, do of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
loſe the opportunities of action. Beſides this, the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> are very conſtant to their Reſolutions; and
tho' they fail once in an Attempt, they will try their
Fortune again, endeavouring to overcome its frowns
by their Conſtancy. They are very fit for War, and
not only brave at the firſt attack, but alſo will hold
out till the laſt; their ſober way of living, and ſpare
Bodies make them fit to bear Hunger and Thirſt, and
to be very watchfull: But this the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
blamed for, that they maintain their Gravity
by high-flown Words and a proud Behaviour. Tho'
thoſe that converſe with them, do declare, that this Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
which appears ſo odious, is not ſo much the effect
of their Pride, as of a melancholy Conſtitution and an
ill Cuſtom, they never being fond to converſe much
with Foreign Nations. They are in general, very
zealous for the <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Religion, and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
all others. They are ſeldom fit for any Trade or
Buſineſs where any hard labour is required; ſuch as
Husbandry, or any Handycraft Trades; wherefore
theſe are chiefly managed among them by Foreigners.
It is credibly reported, That in <hi>Madrid</hi> alone, there
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:65650:49"/>
are above 40000 <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> being for the moſt part,
Merchants, Artiſts, Handycrafts-men and Labourers,
who go under the Name of <hi>Burgundians,</hi> thereby to
avoid the hatred, which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> naturally bear
againſt the <hi>French.</hi> And ſuch is the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> pride,
that tho' they think it below themſelves to meddle
with thoſe trifles, yet they do not think much to be a
poor Centinel in ſome Fort or another all their life
time, the honour of the Sword, and hopes of becoming
in time an Officer, making them amends for what
hardſhip they endure. Their Pride, Covetouſneſs and
rigorous proceedings make them hatefull to all ſuch
as are under their Command; which are very unfit
Qualifications for the maintaining of great Conqueſts.
For no body is willing to be deſpiſed by Foreign Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours.
<hi>Spain</hi> being mightily exhauſted of Men,
and therefore incapable of raiſing great Armies within
it ſelf, is very unfit to maintain vaſt Countries, for
which ſeveral reaſons may be given. For the Women
here are not ſo fruitfull as in the Northern parts,
which is to be attributed to the heat of the Climate,
and the conſtitution of their ſpare Bodies. Thoſe
parts alſo which are remote from the Sea-ſhore, are
not well peopled, ſome of theſe Grounds being very
barren, not producing any thing for the ſubſiſtance of
Mankind. Whoring alſo being publickly allowed of
here; a great many of them will rather make ſhift
with a Whore than to maintain a Wife and Children.
Theſe alſo, who have taken upon them holy Orders,
of whom there is a great number, are obliged not to
marry. The Wars which they have waged againſt ſo
many Nations, but eſpecially in <hi>Italy</hi> and the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,</hi>
have devoured a great many <hi>Spaniards.</hi> A vaſt
number have tranſplanted themſelves into <hi>America,</hi>
being glad to go to a place where they may with a
ſmall beginning come to live very plentifully. Before
the diſcovery was made of <hi>America, Ferdinand</hi> the
<hi>Catholick,</hi> had at once before the City of <hi>Granada,</hi>
an Army of 50000 Foot and 20000 Horſe, tho' <hi>Arra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon</hi>
did not concern it ſelf in that War, and <hi>Portugal</hi>
and <hi>Navarre</hi> were at that time not united with <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile.</hi>
At laſt this Country was mightily diſpeopled,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:65650:49"/>
when <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> after the taking of <hi>Granada,</hi> and
<hi>Philip</hi> III. baniſhed a great many thouſands of <hi>Jews</hi>
and <hi>Marans,</hi> who could not be kept in obedience in
<hi>Spain;</hi> theſe ſettling themſelves in <hi>Africa,</hi> retain to
this day their hatred againſt the Chriſtians, robbing
their Ships in thoſe Seas. But this is evident enough,
that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> could never have made a Conqueſt
of thoſe vaſt Countries, by force of Arms, if the
greateſt part of them had not fallen into their Hands
by eaſier ways.</p>

the Juriſdiction of this Nation; <hi>Spain</hi> is large enough
in extent for the number of its Inhabitants, but it is
not fertile alike in all places; for the moſt remote
parts from the Sea-coaſts are many of them barren,
not producing any thing for the ſubſiſtance of Men or
Beaſts: But for the moſt part, nearer to the Sea-ſide, it
is very fine and fruitfull. There is abundance of Sheep
here. They have alſo very fine Horſes, but not in
very great quantities, having ſcarce enough for their
own uſe. This Kingdom is very well ſituate for
Trade, having on the one ſide the Ocean, and on the
other ſide, being almoſt ſurrounded by the Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean,
where they have moſt excellent Harbours.
The product of their Grounds and Commodities fit
for Exportation, are eſpecially, Wooll, Silk, Wine,
Oyl, Raiſons, Almonds, Figs, Citrons, Rice, Soap,
Iron, Salt, and ſuch like. In former times the <hi>Spaniſh</hi>

Gold nor Silver, as far as I know, is digged out
in <hi>Spain:</hi> Some will alledge for a reaſon, That it is
forbidden under ſevere penalties, to keep it as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
in caſe of a great extremity. But I am rather
apt to believe, That thoſe Gold-mines have been long

already mentioned. Tho' there are that pretend,
That <hi>America</hi> was diſcovered in the Year 1190, by
one <hi>Madoe,</hi> Son to <hi>Owen Geſneth,</hi> a Prince in <hi>Wales,</hi>
who they ſay, made two Voyages thither; and having
built a Fort in <hi>Florida</hi> or <hi>Virginia,</hi> or as ſome ſay, in
<hi>Mexico,</hi> died in <hi>America:</hi> And this is the reaſon why
in the <hi>Mexican</hi> Tongue abundance of <hi>Britiſh</hi> words
are to be met withall; and that the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> at their
firſt coming into <hi>America</hi> did find the remnants of
ſome <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Cuſtoms among the Inhabitants: From
whence ſome inferr, That if the firſt diſcovery of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
gives a good Title of Propriety to the Diſcoverers,
<hi>England</hi> would have as good, if not a better Title to
<hi>America</hi> than <hi>Spain;</hi> but this we will leave to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided
by others. But it is not ſo evident, from
whence <hi>Spain</hi> could claim a right of ſubduing that
Countrey by force of Arms. For, what is alledged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
other pretences, concerning the Bull of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
VI. wherein he did grant thoſe Countries to
<hi>Spain,</hi> this does not only ſeem ridiculous to us, but
alſo to thoſe <hi>Barbarians</hi> themſelves, who have ridicul'd
it, ſaying, <hi>The Pope muſt be a ſtrange ſort of a Man,
who pretended to give away that which was none of his
own:</hi> But let this be as it will, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> think it
ſufficient that they are in poſſeſſion of it; and if an
exact ſcrutiny ſhould be made into other matters of
this nature, it would appear, that the Titles to moſt
conquered Countries were none of the beſt. But
ſome of the moſt conſcientious <hi>Spaniards</hi> do not juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
what Cruelties, their Country-men committed in
the beginning againſt thoſe poor People, of whom
they kill'd, without any provocation given, a great
many hundred thouſands; or deſtroyed them by
forcing them to undergo intolerable hardſhips, and
making the reſt their Slaves: Tho' afterwards <hi>Charles</hi>

                  </note>
The firſt are the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who come thither
out of <hi>Europe;</hi> theſe are put in all Offices. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
are called <hi>Crioliens,</hi> who are born in <hi>America</hi>
of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Parents: Theſe are never employ'd in any
Office, as being ignorant of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Affairs, and
too much addicted to love their native Country of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica;</hi>
wherefore the King is cautious in giving them
any Command, fearing, leſt they ſhould withdraw
themſelves from the Obedience of <hi>Spain,</hi> and ſet up
a Government of their own; eſpecially, becauſe theſe
<hi>Crioliens</hi> bear a great hatred againſt the <hi>European
Spaniards.</hi> For this reaſon alſo the Governours are
changed every three Years, to take away the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of ſtrengthening their Intereſt too much; who
after their return into <hi>Spain</hi> are made Members of the
Council for the <hi>Indies,</hi> as being eſteemed the moſt
proper to adviſe concerning the preſervation of that
Country. The third ſort are called <hi>Metiffs,</hi> who are
born of a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Father and an <hi>Indian</hi> Mother, are in
no eſteem among them. Thoſe who are brought
forth of the marriage of a <hi>Spaniard</hi> with a <hi>Metiff,</hi>
or of a <hi>Metiff</hi> and a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Woman, are called <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tralvos,</hi>
as having three parts of a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and one
of an <hi>Indian:</hi> But ſuch as are born of a <hi>Metiff</hi> and an
<hi>Indian</hi> Woman, or of an <hi>Indian</hi> Man and a <hi>Metiffic</hi>
are called <hi>Treſalvos,</hi> as having three parts of an <hi>Indian</hi>
and one of a <hi>Spaniard.</hi> The fourth ſort are the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
of the ancient Inhabitants, of whom a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
are to be met with, eſpecially in the Kingdoms of
<hi>Peru</hi> and <hi>Mexico,</hi> who are not ſo Barbarous as ſome
may imagine, there having been found among them
ſuch excellent Laws and Conſtitutions as would make
ſome <hi>Europeans</hi> bluſh. The fifth ſort are the <hi>Moores,</hi>
or, as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> call them, <hi>Negroes,</hi> who being
bought in <hi>Africa</hi> are ſent thither to do all ſorts of
drudgery. Theſe are generally very handy, but very
perfidious and refractary, wherefore they muſt always
be kept under a ſtrict hand. Such as are born of a
<hi>Negro</hi> and an <hi>Indian</hi> Woman are called <hi>Mulats:</hi> Yet
is that part of <hi>America,</hi> conſidering its bigneſs, not
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:65650:51"/>
very well ſtock'd with People, ſince the <hi>Spaniards</hi> did
in a moſt cruel manner root out the moſt of its anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Inhabitants: And if I remember well, <hi>Hieronymus
Benzonus</hi> ſays, <hi>That all the Cities in</hi> America, <hi>which
are inhabited by the</hi> Spaniards, <hi>joined together, were
ſcarce to be compared, for number of People, with the
Suburbs of</hi> Milan: Yet there are ſome who talk large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
concerning <hi>Mexico, viz.</hi> That it has betwixt 30
and 40000 <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Citizens, who are moſt of them
very wealthy, ſo that it is reported, there are 18000
Coaches kept in that City. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> are not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
to be beaten out of <hi>America;</hi> becauſe moſt places
which are in their poſſeſſion, are hard to come at, and
it is very difficult to tranſport ſuch a number of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
out of <hi>Europe,</hi> as can be ſufficient to attack any
of theſe places: Beſides this, the great difference of the
Climate, and Diet could not but occaſion mortal ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
among them: But in <hi>Peru,</hi> eſpecially, they are
very well ſettled, there being ſcarce any acceſs by
Land, and by Sea you are obliged to go round the
South and remoteſt parts of <hi>America,</hi> or elſe to come
from the <hi>Eaſt Indies;</hi> both which are ſuch long Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyages,
which an Army can ſcarce undergo without

the Inhabitants; but an inconceivable quantity of
uncoined Gold and Silver, and abundance of Gold
and Silver Veſſels made without Iron Tools, all which
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> carry'd into <hi>Spain,</hi> except what the
Seas ſwallowed up in their Voyages, which was very
conſiderable: But now-a-days thoſe Rivers which
formerly uſed to carry a Golden Sand, are moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted;
and what is found there now is all dug up
out of the Mines; eſpecially the Silver Mines of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſi</hi>
in <hi>Peru,</hi> do afford an incredible quantity of Silver,
which is yearly, together with ſome other Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
tranſported in a Fleet into <hi>Spain:</hi> Nevertheleſs
a great part of this Silver belonging to <hi>Italian, French,

in <hi>Spain;</hi> ſo that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> keep the Cow,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:65650:51"/>

Precedency,<note place="margin">1563.</note> and the latter, to repreſent his
Maſter's Greatneſs, ſpoke very largely of the vaſt
Riches of <hi>America,</hi> the <hi>Frenchman</hi> anſwered, <hi>That
all</hi> Europe, <hi>but eſpecially</hi> Spain, <hi>had been a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
loſer by them: The</hi> Spaniards <hi>having employed
themſelves in ſearching after the Treaſures of</hi> America,
<hi>were thereby become idle, and had diſpeopled their own
Country. The King of</hi> Spain <hi>truſting to his great
Riches, had begun unneceſſary Wars.</hi> Spain <hi>being the
fountain from whence vaſt Riches were derived to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Nations, did receive the leaſt benefit of all by
them, ſince thoſe Countries that furniſh'd</hi> Spain <hi>with
Souldiers, and other Commodities did draw thoſe Riches
to themſelves.</hi> Formerly there were alſo Emeraulds in
<hi>America,</hi> and Pearls were found, but that Stock is
long ſince, by the Avarice of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> quite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted.
There is beſides this, a great quantity of
Commodities in <hi>America,</hi> which are uſed in Phyſick
and Dying Colours. There is alſo great quantities of
Sugars and Hides, as appears in that in the Year 1587
the <hi>Spainſh</hi> Fleet tranſported 35444 Hides from
St. <hi>Domingo,</hi> and 64350 from <hi>New Spain:</hi> For the
Oxen and Cows, which were firſt tranſported from
<hi>Spain</hi> into <hi>America,</hi> are grown ſo numerous, that they
ſhoot them for their Hides ſake only, throwing away
the Fleſh, which is ſcarce eatable. And as <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica</hi>
is the beſt Appendix of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Kingdom, ſo
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> take all imaginable care to prevent its
being ſeparated from <hi>Spain.</hi> They make, among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things, uſe of this Artifice, That they will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
any Manufactory to be ſet up in <hi>America,</hi> ſo that
the Inhabitants cannot be without the <hi>European</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities,
which they do not ſuffer to be tranſported
thither in any other Ships but their own.</p>

               </p>
               <p>§. 19. From what has been ſaid it is evident,<note place="margin">Strength and Weakneſs of <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </note> that
<hi>Spain</hi> is a potent Kingdom, which has under its Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
rich and fair Countries, abounding with all
Neceſſaries, not only ſufficient for the uſe of its Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants,
but alſo affording a great overplus for Expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
The <hi>Spaniards</hi> alſo do not want Wiſdom in
managing their State Affairs, nor Valour to carry on
a War: Nevertheleſs this vaſt Kingdom has its Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
which have brought it ſo low, that it is ſcarce
able to ſtand upon its own Legs: Among thoſe is to
be eſteemed one, the want of Inhabitants in <hi>Spain,</hi>
there being not a ſufficient number both to keep in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
ſuch great Provinces, and at the ſame time
to make Head againſt a potent Enemy; which want
is not eaſily to be repaired out of thoſe Countries
which are under their ſubjection, ſince it is the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
of <hi>Spain,</hi> rather to reſtrain the Courage of theſe
Inhabitants, for fear they ſhould one time or another
take Heart, and ſhake off the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Yoak. And
whenever they raiſe ſome Souldier in theſe Provinces,
they cannot truſt them with the defence of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Country, but are obliged to diſperſe them, by
ſending them into other Parts, under the Command
only of <hi>Spaniards: Spain</hi> therefore is ſcarce able to
raiſe within it ſelf, a ſufficient number of Souldiers for
the Guard and Defence of its frontier places: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
whenever <hi>Spain</hi> happens to have War with other
Nations, it is obliged to make uſe of Foreign Souldiers,
and to raiſe thoſe, is not only very chargeable but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
the King is not ſo well aſſured of their Faith, as of
that of his own Subjects. The want of Inhabitants is
alſo one reaſon, why <hi>Spain</hi> cannot now-a-days keep a
conſiderable Fleet at Sea, which nevertheleſs is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
neceſſary to ſupport the Monarchy of that
Kingdom. Another weakneſs is, That the <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Provinces are mightily diſ-joined, they being divided
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:65650:53"/>
by vaſt Seas and Countries: Theſe therefore cannot be
maintained and governed without great difficulty;
for the Governours of the Provinces being remote from
the ſight of the Prince, he cannot take ſo exact an
account of their Actions; and the oppreſſed Subjects
want often opportunity to make their Complaints to
the King; beſides that, Men and Money are with
great charge and danger ſent out of <hi>Spain</hi> into theſe
Provinces, without hopes of ever returning into the
Kingdom. Their Strength cannot be kept together,
as being obliged to divide their Forces. The more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined
theſe Provinces are, the more frontier Garriſons
are to be maintained; all which may be ſaved in a
Kingdom, whoſe parts are not ſo much diſ-joined.
They are alſo liable to being attack'd in a great many
places at once, one Province not being able to aſſiſt
another: Beſides this, <hi>America</hi> being the Treaſury of
<hi>Spain,</hi> is parted from it by the vaſt Ocean, whereby
their Silver Fleets are ſubject to the hazard of the Seas
and Pyrates. And if it happens that ſuch a Fleet is
loſt, the whole Government muſt needs ſuffer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
by the want of it, the Inhabitants of <hi>Spain</hi>
being ſo exhauſted, as not to be able to raiſe ſufficient
Summs to ſupply the Publick Neceſſities. The <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
are alſo mighty deficient in regulating their
<hi>Weſt India</hi> Trade, which is ſo ill managed, that the
greateſt part of thoſe Riches are conveyed to other
Nations, whereby they are empoured to chaſtiſe <hi>Spain</hi>
with its own Money. After the death of <hi>Philip</hi> II. it
has alſo proved very prejudicial to <hi>Spain,</hi> that by the
careleſſneſs of the ſucceeding Kings, and during the long
Minority of this preſent, the Nobles have ſo increaſed
their Power, that they are now very backward in
duely aſſiſting the King, and by impoveriſhing the
King and Commonalty have got all the Riches to
themſelves. It is alſo a common Diſeaſe in all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments,
where the Popiſh Religion has got the
upper hand, That the Popiſh Clergy is very rich and
potent, and yet pretends, by a Divine Right, to be
exempted from all publick burdens, except that ſome
of them in the utmoſt extremity vouchſafe to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
ſome ſmall portion for the defence of the whole,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:65650:53"/>
but that not without conſent of the Pope: Yet the
King of <hi>Spain</hi> has that Prerogative, which he obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from Pope <hi>Hadrian</hi> IV. that he has the diſpoſal of
all the chief Church Benefices in his Kingdom; and he
is alſo Head and Maſter of all the Eccleſiaſtical Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of Knighthood in <hi>Spain.</hi> And becauſe the Kings
of <hi>Spain</hi> have hitherto pretended to be the moſt zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Protectours of the Papal Chair and Religion,
they have thereby ſo obliged the Zealots of the <hi>Roman
Catholick</hi> Religion, and eſpecially the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> that
theſe have always been endeavouring to promote the
Intereſt of <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 20. Laſtly,<note place="margin">In what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition <hi>Spain</hi> is in, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to its Neighbours, and eſpecially as to <hi>Barbary.</hi>
                  </note> It is alſo worth our obſervation,
how <hi>Spain</hi> does behave it ſelf in relation to its Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
and what Good or Evil it may again expect
from them. <hi>Spain</hi> therefore is oppoſite to the Coaſt
of <hi>Barbary,</hi> having alſo ſeveral Forts on that ſide, <hi>viz.
Pegnon de Velez, Oran, Arzilla,</hi> and would be better
if they had alſo <hi>Algiers</hi> and <hi>Tunis.</hi> From hence <hi>Spain</hi>
need not fear any thing now, ſince it has quite freed it
ſelf from the very Remnants of the <hi>Moors:</hi> But the Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies
committted by thoſe <hi>Corſaires</hi> is not ſo hurtfull
to <hi>Spain,</hi> as to other Nations, who traffique with <hi>Spain,
Italy</hi> or <hi>Turky;</hi> for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſeldom export their
own Commodities into the other parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> but
theſe are exported by other Nations.<note place="margin">Turky.</note> The <hi>Turks</hi>
ſeem to be pretty near to the Iſlands of <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinia,</hi>
and to the Kingdom of <hi>Naples:</hi> Yet are they
not much feared by the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> the Sea which
lies betwixt them being an obſtacle againſt making a
Deſcent with a conſiderable Army in any of thoſe
Parts; and if an Army ſhould be landed, its Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
which muſt come by Sea, might eaſily be cut
off: For in ſuch a caſe all the States of <hi>Italy</hi> would
be obliged to ſide with the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to keep this
cruel Enemy from their Borders, and their Naval
Strength joined together, much ſurpaſſes the <hi>Turks</hi> in
every reſpect.<note place="margin">Italian <hi>States.</hi>
                  </note> From the <hi>Italian</hi> States, the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
have little to fear, it being a maxim with them, to
preſerve the Peace of <hi>Italy,</hi> thereby to take away all
opportunity from <hi>France</hi> to get a footing in <hi>Italy,</hi>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:65650:54"/>
which is alſo a general maxim among all the States
of <hi>Italy:</hi> Nevertheleſs this is moſt certain, That if
<hi>Spain</hi> ſhould endeavour to encroach upon the reſt of
the <hi>Italian</hi> States, they would unanimouſly oppoſe it;
and if they ſhould find themſelves too weak to oppoſe
their Deſigns, they might be eaſily wrought upon to
call <hi>France</hi> to their aid.<note place="margin">The Pope.</note> The Pope, perhaps, might
be willing enough to be Maſter of the Kingdom of
<hi>Naples, Spain</hi> holding the ſame in Fief of the Papal
Chair, and thereby the Popes might have a freſh op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to enrich their Kindred: But the Pope
wants Power to execute ſuch a Deſign, and the reſt
of the States of <hi>Italy</hi> would not be forward to ſee ſo
conſiderable a Country added to the Eccleſiaſtical
State; and the Pope's Kindred are more for gathering
of Riches out of the preſent Eccleſiaſtical Revenues,
than to beſtow the ſame upon an uncertain War. On
the other ſide, <hi>Spain</hi> having found it very beneficial
for its Intereſt, to pretend to the chief Protectorſhip
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, and that the Pope's good or
bad Inclinations towards it, may either prove advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous
or diſadvantageous, <hi>Spain</hi> has always endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
by all means to keep fair with the Popes.
<hi>France,</hi> on the contrary, having taken part with the
<hi>Proteſtants,</hi> whom <hi>Spain</hi> and the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi>
have ſought to oppreſs, has demonſtrated ſufficiently
to the <hi>Roman</hi> Court, that it is not ſo fond of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
as to neglect an opportunity to enrich himſelf
with the Poſſeſſions of the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and to make
way for attaining to the ſo long projected Deſign of the
Univerſal Monarchy; which done, he might eaſily
make the Pope his Chaplain: Wherefore the chief aim
of the wiſeſt Popes has been, to keep the Power of
<hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France</hi> in an equal Balance, this being the
moſt proper method to keep up the Authority and
provide for the Security of the Popedom. It being
the principal maxim of the <hi>Venetians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Venice.</note> to reſerve their
Liberty and State, by maintaining the Peace of <hi>Italy,
Spain</hi> has no reaſon to be jealous of them as long as it
undertakes nothing againſt them. It is alſo the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt,
as well of them as of all the other <hi>Italian</hi> States,
that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> remain in poſſeſſion of <hi>Milan,</hi> for
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:65650:54"/>
fear, if <hi>France</hi> ſhould become Maſter of this Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
it might thereby be put in a way to conquer
all the reſt of <hi>Italy.</hi> On the other ſide, if <hi>Spain</hi> ſhould
ſhew the leaſt Inclination to undertake any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Liberty of <hi>Italy,</hi> it cannot expect, but that
the <hi>Venetians,</hi> if not by an open War, at leaſt, by
their Counſels and Money would oppoſe it: For the
reſt, this State endeavours to remain Neuter betwixt
<hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> and to keep fair with both of them,
as long as they do not act againſt their Intereſt; <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noua</hi>
is of great conſequence to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Genouae.</note> from
which, depends in a great meaſure, the Security and
Preſervation of the <hi>Milaneze:</hi> Wherefore, when
<hi>Charles</hi> V. could not effect his Intention of building
a Caſtle (being oppoſed therein by <hi>Andreas Doria)</hi>
whereby he intended to make the <hi>Genoueſes</hi> dance af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

make them dependent on their Intereſt, by borrowing
vaſt Summs of Money from the <hi>Genoueſes</hi> upon the
ſecurity of the King's Revenues in <hi>Spain.</hi> Beſides
this, they are poſſeſs'd of the Harbour of <hi>Final</hi> on the
Coaſt of <hi>Genoua,</hi> whereby they have taken away the
power from them of cutting off the Correſpondency
betwixt <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Milan. Spain</hi> has great reaſon to
give in a good Correſpondency with <hi>Savoy;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Savoy.</note> for if that
Prince ſhould ſide with <hi>France</hi> againſt it, the <hi>Mila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neze</hi>

King of <hi>France</hi> ſhould become Maſter of <hi>Milan,</hi>
ſince <hi>Savoy</hi> would be then ſurrounded on all ſides by

But if the old Maxims of Policy are not grown quite
out of date, it is to be hoped, that all who have any
Intereſt in the preſervation of <hi>Spain,</hi> will with all
their power endeavour to prevent, that the ruin of

But <hi>Alfonſus</hi> of <hi>Portugal</hi> defeated the <hi>Caſtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Dionyſius.</note> eſpecially, Juſtice, Liberality and Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
are highly extoll'd by the <hi>Portugueſes:</hi> He having
alſo adorn'd the Kingdom with a great many publick
Buildings, among which is the Academy of <hi>Conim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bria,</hi>
firſt founded by him. There is an old Proverb
concerning him, uſed among the <hi>Portugueſes, El Rey
D. Denys, qui fiz quanto quin:</hi> King <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> who
did whatſoever he pleaſed. He died in the Year 1325;
his Son. <hi>Alfonſus</hi> IV.<note place="margin">Alfonſus IV.</note> ſirnamed <hi>the Brave,</hi> was very

beloved both by his Father and the People; and
cauſed <hi>D. Agnes de Caſtro,</hi> a very beautiful Lady,
who was without his conſent married to his Son <hi>Pieter,</hi>
barbarouſly to be murthered; which ſo exaſperated
<hi>Pieter,</hi> that he taking up Arms againſt the Father,
did conſiderable miſchief, till at laſt the buſineſs was
compoſed.<note place="margin">Pieter.</note> He died in the Year 1357. His Son <hi>Pieter</hi>
was commonly called <hi>the Cruel,</hi> tho' ſome will
have this rather to have been ſpoken to his praiſe, as
having been an exact obſerver of Juſtice, never ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
any Offender. He died in the Year 1368. His
Son <hi>Ferdinand</hi> contended with <hi>Henry</hi> the Baſtard,<note place="margin">Ferdinand.</note> who
had murthered his Brother <hi>Pieter,</hi> ſirnamed <hi>the Cruel,</hi>
King of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> about the Kingdom of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
his Mother <hi>Beatrice</hi> had been Daughter of <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctius</hi>
IV. King of <hi>Caſtile;</hi> and a great many of the
Nobility and ſome Cities of that Kingdom declaring
for him, he waged War againſt the forementioned
<hi>Henry.</hi> But he being too ſtrong for him, he could not
maintain his Pretenſions, but was obliged to make
Peace.<note place="margin">1373.</note> However the War broke out afreſh again be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them, becauſe <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had protected ſome
who were baniſhed out of <hi>Caſtile</hi> for High Treaſon,
neither would, upon demand, ſurrender them. To
revenge this, <hi>Henry</hi> made an inrode into <hi>Portugal,</hi> and
finding no reſiſtance, over-ran the greateſt part of the
Country. After the death of <hi>Henry, Ferdinand</hi> made
a Peace with his Son <hi>John,</hi> but the ſame was ſoon vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
again by the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> who encouraged the
Duke of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> that married <hi>Conſtantia</hi> Daughter
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:65650:57"/>
of <hi>Pieter</hi> King of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> to pretend to the Crown of
<hi>Caſtile:</hi> He came with a good Army into <hi>Portugal;</hi>
but the <hi>Engliſh</hi> being quickly grown weary of the
War in <hi>Spain,</hi> and living very diſorderly in <hi>Portugal,</hi>
a Peace was concluded on both ſides. At laſt <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi>
married his Daughter <hi>Beatrice</hi> to <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Caſtile,</hi>
under condition, that ſuch Children as were born of
their Bodies, ſhould ſucceed in the Kingdom of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal;</hi>
which was afterwards the occaſion of bloody
Wars. This <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> who by his frequent Wars
had proved very pernicious to <hi>Portugal,</hi> died in the
Year 1383, being the laſt of the true Race of the
Kings of <hi>Portugal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 3. After the death of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> great Troubles
aroſe in <hi>Portugal,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Interregnum.</note> moſt of the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> not being
able to brook living under the Subjection of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilians,</hi>
whom they mortally hated. It was, 'tis
true, agreed on in the Articles of Marriage made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> and <hi>Beatrice</hi> Daughter of
<hi>Ferdinand,</hi> That her Mother <hi>Eleonora</hi> ſhould have the
Adminiſtration of the Government in <hi>Portugal,</hi> till
ſuch Children as ſhould be born of this Marriage
ſhould be of age: But this <hi>Eleonora,</hi> leaving all to the
management of the Count of <hi>Ancira,</hi> her much ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
Favourite, ſhe drew upon her ſelf the hatred of
the <hi>Portugueſes. John,</hi> therefore, natural Son of <hi>Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> privately murther'd him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he got both the Favour of the People, and encreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the hatred againſt the Queen Dowager: But ſome
of the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> being much diſſatisfy'd at theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,
begg'd the King of <hi>Caſtile,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Some call in the King of <hi>Caſtile.</hi>
                  </note> to take upon
him the Crown of <hi>Portugal;</hi> which he might in all
likelyhood have obtained, if he had been quick e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
either by fair means or by force, to have put
himſelf into full poſſeſſion of the ſame: But he being
uncertain in his Reſolutions, gave by his delays, time
and opportunity to the adverſe Party to ſtrengthen it
ſelf. Wherefore, he coming without an Army into
<hi>Portugal,</hi> his Mother-in-law reſign'd to him the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
but he found but an indifferent Reception
among the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> they being very averſe to him
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:65650:58"/>
becauſe he uſed very rarely to ſpeak or converſe with
them: Nevertheleſs a great many of the Nobility and
ſome Cities did ſide with him; but moſt out of a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
to the <hi>Caſtilians,</hi> choſe for their Leader <hi>John</hi> the
<hi>Baſtard,</hi> a wiſe and brave Man, and much belov'd by
the People. The <hi>Caſtilians</hi> thereupon beſieged <hi>Lisbon,</hi>
but their Army being for the moſt part deſtroyed by
the Plague, they were obliged to leave it without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
got any advantage.<note place="margin">1385.</note> In the Year next following,
the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> declar'd this <hi>John</hi> their King,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>John</hi> the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard.</note> who ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
courageouſly attack'd thoſe places, which had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
for the <hi>Caſtilians,</hi> and ſubdued the greateſt part
of them. The <hi>Caſtilians</hi> then entred with an Army
into <hi>Portugal,</hi> but were entirely routed by this new
King near <hi>Aliubarotta,</hi> which Victory is yearly cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
to this day among the <hi>Portugueſes.</hi> After this
Battel, all the reſt of the Cities did without more adoe
ſurrender themſelves to the new King. The <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſes</hi>
alſo calling unto their aid, the Duke of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter,</hi>
unto whom they had promiſed the Crown of
<hi>Caſtile,</hi> they enter'd into that Kingdom with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my:
But the <hi>Engliſh</hi> having ſuffer'd extreamly by
Sickneſs, the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> thought it moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
to conclude a Peace with the <hi>Caſtilians,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
it was agreed, That the Son of the King of <hi>Caſtile</hi>
ſhould marry his only Daughter <hi>Catharine,</hi> which he
had by <hi>Conſtantia,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Pieter</hi> King of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile.</hi>
A Truce was alſo made betwixt <hi>Portugal</hi> and
<hi>Caſtile</hi> at that time; but the War ſoon breaking out
again,<note place="margin">1399.</note> at laſt, an everlaſting Peace was concluded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
both Kingdoms; ſo that <hi>John</hi> had the good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
to maintain himſelf in the poſſeſſion of the Crown
of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and reign'd with great applauſe. After
he was quietly ſettled in the Throne, he undertook an
Expedition into <hi>Africa,</hi> and took the City <hi>Ceuta;</hi>
whoſe Son alſo firſt found out the Iſle of <hi>Madera.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1415.</note>
This King died in the Year 1433,<note place="margin">1420.</note> and left a Memory

but did not reign long; for at that time, <hi>Portugal</hi> being
over-run with the Plague, he got the Infection by a

Letter, and died in the Year 1438. During his Reign,
his Brothers undertook a moſt unfortunate Expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

<hi>Don Pedro</hi> Duke of <hi>Conimbria,</hi> Brother to King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi>
but he received a very ſlender Recompence for
his Services; for being falſely accuſed before the new
King, he was ſlain as he was going with ſome Troops
to the King to juſtifie himſelf. <hi>Alfonſus</hi> V. was elſe a very
good Souldier and a brave Prince, under whoſe Reign the
<hi>Portugueſes</hi> took ſeveral places on the Coaſt of <hi>Africa,</hi>
viz. <hi>Tangier, Arcilla, Alcaſſar,</hi> and ſome others.
Good ſtore of Gold was alſo tranſported out of <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea</hi>

<hi>Lewis</hi> XI. alſo, King of <hi>France,</hi> ſent him ſome Auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaries,

great Intereſt in <hi>Japan,</hi> which was chiefly procured
by means of the Jeſuites, who made it their buſineſs
to convert the <hi>Japoneſes</hi> to the Chriſtian Religion. It
is related, that above 400000 of them were baptized,
not without hopes, that all the reſt would at laſt have
followed their example. But about thirty years a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,
the <hi>Dutch,</hi> by their Practices and Artifices, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> ſuſpected to the Emperour of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan,</hi>
having intercepted a Letter from the Jeſuits to
the Pope, wherein they promiſed to bring, ere long,
the whole Kingdom of <hi>Japan</hi> under the Obedience of
the <hi>Roman</hi> See. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> interpreted this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in ſuch a ſenſe, as if the Jeſuits, with the aſſiſtance
of the new Converts, did intend to dethrone the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour;
telling him, That the Pope pretended to an
Authority of diſpoſing of Kingdoms at his pleaſure,
and that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> who was then Maſter of
<hi>Portugal,</hi> was in great eſteem with him. The jealous
<hi>Japoneſes</hi> were eaſily perſuaded hereof, when they
conſidered with what Reſpect and Kindneſs the Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its
were treated by the new Chriſtians; thoſe being
alſo very ready to accept of what theſe good natur'd
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:65650:63"/>
People offered them. And the Governours were ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
and complained, that their uſual Preſents from
the Subjects decreaſed daily, ſince the new Converts
gave ſo much to their Prieſts. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> alſo
ſhew'd the Emperour of <hi>Japan</hi> in a Mapp, how the
Conqueſts of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> did extend on one
ſide as far as <hi>Manilla,</hi> on the other ſide as far as <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cao,</hi>
ſo that by ſubduing of <hi>Japan,</hi> he would have an
opportunity of uniting his Conqueſts. This occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a moſt horrible Perſecution againſt the Chriſtians,
the <hi>Japoneſes</hi> endeavouring by incredible Torments to
overcome the Conſtancy of a Nation, which is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
one of the moſt obſtinate. Neither did they
ceaſe, till there was not one Chriſtian left in <hi>Japan,</hi>
and the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> upon pain of death, were for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

their Subjects, to ſhew the leaſt appearance of

                  </note> 
                  <hi>Britainy,</hi> which was then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed
the biggeſt Iſland of the World, was
not ruled by one Prince, but divided into a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
petty States, each of them govern'd by its own
King; but this multitude of petty Princes, as it
cauſed great Diviſions among them, ſo it expoſed them
to the danger of being overcome by their Foreign E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.
This Iſland was ſcarce known to the <hi>Greeks</hi>
and <hi>Romans</hi> till <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi>'s time, who, after he
had conquer'd the greateſt part of <hi>France,</hi> undertook
an Expedition into this Iſland, hoping, as 'tis ſuppos'd,
to meet there with great Booty and Riches. But he
enter'd not very far into the Country, and after ſome
Skirmiſhes with the Inhabitants, returned again with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
leaving a Garriſon, or exacting any Contributions.
After this <hi>Britainy</hi> was not attack'd again by the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
till under the Reign of the Emperour <hi>Claudius,</hi>
who bent his Arms againſt it in good earneſt, and
the Inhabitants being divided among themſelves, and
not joined in a mutual defence againſt the common
Enemy,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The</hi> Romans <hi>conquer</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> he, without great difficulty, conquer'd part
of it. At which time <hi>Britainy</hi> was made a <hi>Roman</hi>
Province, a conſtant Army being maintained here by
the <hi>Romans,</hi> who by degrees conquered one part after
another, yet not without receiving ſome Defeats. At
laſt, under the Reign of <hi>Domitian, Julius Agricola</hi>
marched with his victorious Army through the whole
Iſland, and giving a ſignal overthrow to the <hi>Caledoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
who are now called the <hi>Scots,</hi> ſubdued them;
tho' the <hi>Romans</hi> could never entirely conquer the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
parts of <hi>Britainy,</hi> being almoſt inacceſſible.
Wherefore, afterwards the Emperours <hi>Adrian</hi> and <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verus,</hi>
by building a Wall croſs the Iſland from Sea to
Sea, divided them from the <hi>Roman</hi> Province, hoping
thereby to ſtop their Incurſions. But the <hi>Romans</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
came into <hi>Ireland.</hi> After the <hi>Britains</hi> had been
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:65650:65"/>
above 400 Years under ſubjection to the <hi>Romans,</hi> the
Northern Nations at that time over-running the
Weſtern parts of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, the <hi>Romans</hi> left
this Iſland voluntarily, being obliged to recall their
Legions, which were poſted in <hi>Britainy,</hi> to oppoſe
their Enemies.</p>
               <p>§. 2. <hi>Britainy</hi> being thus without an Army,<note place="margin">The <hi>Saxons</hi> come into <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainy.</hi>
                  </note> and
beſides, this, mightily exhauſted in its Strength, for
that the <hi>Romans</hi> had made uſe of their young Men in
their Wars, the <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> from their barren
Country, made an Inrode into theſe plentifull Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
deſtroying all before them. The <hi>Engliſh,</hi> to
make the better Head againſt them, had choſen one

it being certain, that the mordern Language of the
<hi>Frieſlanders</hi> has a great affinity with the ancient <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>

drive them out of the Iſland; but theſe taking up
Arms, and calling in a great many thouſands of their
Country-men to their aſſiſtance, firſt took from the
<hi>Britains</hi> the Eaſtern parts of the Iſland. And the
Weſtern parts, which were yet in the poſſeſſion of the
<hi>Britains,</hi> being afterwards extreamly waſted by
Plague and Famine, ſo that the <hi>Britiſh</hi> King <hi>Cad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walladar</hi>
retired into the <hi>leſſer Britainy:</hi> The <hi>Saxons</hi>
took hold of this opportunity, conquering all the reſt

a Baſtard, yet his Father made him his Succeſſour,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:65650:67"/>
and got the Nobility to acknowledge him as ſuch

him the Adminiſtration of the Goods and Poſſeſſions
of all Minors, till they came to the 21ſt Year of Age,
allowing them only ſo much as was requiſite for their
Maintenance: He reviſed all their Privileges, intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
new Laws in the <hi>Norman</hi> Tongue; whereby a
great many, that did not underſtand that Language,
fell under ſevere Penalties: He erected new Courts of
Judicature, and employed great tracts of Ground for

firſt the uſe of the long Bow in <hi>England,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

But the Nobles, who had diſperſed themſelves up and

by force, reduced to Obedience. This Rebellion
proved very beneficial to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the Rebels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

rely'd more upon the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as the moſt

Fealty, but in the laſt, he killed both him and his
eldeſt Son. He alſo ſubdued the Province of <hi>Wales.</hi>
Among other Inventions to get Money one was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable;
for he ſummon'd together 20000 Men,
under pretence to go with them into <hi>Normandy,</hi> but

ceaſed for a little time, there was a Foundation laid
in <hi>England</hi> for inteſtine Commotions. The King had
promiſed marriage to the Daughter of the Earl of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magnac,</hi>
to prevent which, the <hi>French</hi> King had made
both the Earl and his Daughter Priſoners. The Earl of
<hi>Suffolk,</hi> who was then Ambaſſadour in <hi>France,</hi> did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
thereupon, without having received any Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to that purpoſe from the King, a Match betwixt the
King and <hi>Margaret</hi> Daughter of <hi>Renè,</hi> Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi>

the King to ratifie the ſame. This Match was migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
oppoſed by the Duke of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> the King's
Uncle, who alledged, That her Father had only the
bare Titles of King and Duke; and that beſides this,
great Injury was done thereby to the firſt Bride, <hi>viz.</hi>
to the Daughter of the Count of <hi>Armagnac.</hi> Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
this, the Match went forward, and to
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:65650:78"/>
obtain the Bride of the <hi>French, Anjou</hi> and <hi>Maine</hi> were
given them as a Recompence. The King being thus
led away by the Queen and his Favourites, her firſt
deſign was to revenge her ſelf upon the Duke of
<hi>Glouceſter,</hi> whom ſhe accuſed of Male Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and after ſhe had got him committed to Priſon,
cauſed him privately to be murther'd. The death of
ſo innocent a Man did afterwards fall heavy upon the
King: For the <hi>French,</hi>

                  <note place="margin">The occaſion of this ſudden loſs.</note> This ſudden loſs was occaſioned

Pride of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> whereby they were become
hatefull to the <hi>French</hi> Subjects: But the chief cauſe
was, <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi> who had underhand

ſenſible of the King's Weakneſs, and how ill ſatisfy'd
the People were with the Queen's management of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
hoped, by fomenting and raiſing Troubles in
the Kingdom, to make way for himſelf to obtain the
Crown; and this he did, principally, becauſe he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to have the beſt right to the Crown, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended,
by his Mother's ſide, from <hi>Lionel</hi> Duke of
<hi>Clarence,</hi> third Son of King <hi>Edward</hi> III. whereas
<hi>Henry</hi> was deſcended from <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> fourth Son
of the ſaid <hi>Edward</hi> III. but publickly he profeſs'd,
That his Intention was only to remove from the King's
Perſon his pernicious Favourites, and eſpecially the
Duke of <hi>Somerſet.</hi> Having therefore got an Army
on foot, he fought with the King's Forces, in which
Battel the Duke of <hi>Somerſet</hi> was ſlain, and the Duke
of <hi>York</hi> thereupon declared Protector of the King's
Perſon and the Kingdom. But this Agreement did
not laſt long, and things came quickly again to an
open War, wherein the Duke of <hi>York</hi> being worſted,
was forced to fly into <hi>Ireland.</hi> But not long after
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:65650:79"/>
the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> did beat the King's Army, and
taking him Priſoner, the Duke of <hi>York</hi> was again de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
Protector of the King and Kingdom, and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Heir of the Crown; under condition that <hi>Henry</hi>
ſhould retain the Title of King during his life. But
Matters did not remain long in this condition, for the
Queen, who was fled into <hi>Scotland,</hi> marched with a
great Army againſt the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> who was kill'd
in the Battel, and all the Priſoners were executed.
But his Son, in conjunction with the Earl of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi>
raiſed another Army, and marching up to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>

And tho' an Agreement was then made betwixt

Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi>'s Forces were routed, and he forced

not ſo probable to ſome, ſince he did not marry the

the ſcruple of Conſcience; whereas the heat of Love
does not uſually admit of ſuch delays. Some will
have it, that Cardinal <hi>Woolſey</hi> raiſed this ſcruple firſt

of Popery, were for having every thing regulated ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

her Life and Crown; for her envious Enemies did erect
ſeveral Seminaries or Schools for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation

Inſtructing of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Youth in theſe Principles,
<hi>viz.</hi> That the Pope had the Supream Power over
Kings, and as ſoon as a King was declared a Heretick
by him, the Subjects were thereby abſolved from their
Allegiance due to him, and that it was meritorious
work to murther ſuch a King. Out of theſe Schools
Emiſſaries and Prieſts were ſent into <hi>England,</hi> whoſe
buſineſs was there to propagate the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick
Religion; but more eſpecially, to inſtruct the People
in the abovementioned Doctrines. To theſe aſſociated

conſpiring againſt her Life. But moſt of them got

was ſo much in favour with the Queen, that a great

whence King <hi>James,</hi> with whom Queen <hi>Mary</hi> was then
big with Child, had this natural infirmity, That he could
not ſee a naked Sword, his Mother having at that time
been frighted with naked Swords. This ſo exaſperated
the Queen againſt her Husband, that he ſoon after,<note place="margin">The Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> married <hi>Bothwell,</hi> who murthered her Husband.</note> as

But with <hi>Spain</hi> ſhe was at variance about the Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious

<hi>Cadiz;</hi> but quitted it immediately after. On the

Commotions and Conſpiracies againſt her. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were of Opinion, That <hi>England</hi>
might be ſooner conquer'd than the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and
that the latter could not be ſubdued without the
other, they equipp'd a Fleet which they called <hi>the

                  <note place="margin">The <hi>Armado</hi> defeated.</note> Which Fleet, to the Immortal Glory of

ſupported conſtantly the Rebels in <hi>Ireland,</hi> who
were very troubleſome to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> tho' they
were generally beaten by her Forces, except in the
Year 1596, when they ſoundly beat the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
Wherefore the Queen ſent thither the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi>
who did nothing worth mentioning. And after his
return, the Queen giving him a ſevere Reprimand,
and ordering him to be kept a Priſoner, he was ſo
exaſperated at it, that tho' he was reconcil'd to the
Queen, he endeavoured to raiſe an Inſurrection in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>

which coſt him his Head. Tho' the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
were twice repulſed and chaſed out of <hi>Ireland</hi> with
conſiderable loſs, yet the Rebellion laſted till the very
end of her life. Neither could a Peace be concluded
betwixt her and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> as long as ſhe lived:

be brought to take a Reſolution to marry, tho'
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:65650:88"/>
her Subjects did greatly deſire it, and ſhe had great
Offers made her; amongſt whom were, beſides <hi>Philip,

the Duke <hi>de Anjou,</hi> and his Brother the Duke <hi>de A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenſon,</hi>
the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> &amp;c. It was her cuſtom
not to give a flat denial to ſuch as ſued for her in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
but ſhe uſed to amuſe them with hopes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
ſhe made them her Friends: For ſhe treated with
<hi>Charles</hi> Archduke of <hi>Auſtria</hi> for ſeven Years together,
and with the Duke of <hi>Alenſon</hi> ſhe was gone ſo far, as
that the Marriage Contract was made, yet was it ſo
drawn as that a way was found to annul the ſame af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards.
Under her Reign the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Trade was
firſt eſtabliſhed in <hi>Turkey</hi> and the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> the fineſt
Coin, as alſo the Manufactury of Serges and Bays
was ſettled in <hi>England</hi> about the ſame time. This
Queen alſo brought firſt into Reputation the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Naval Strength,<note place="margin">She was jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of her Power at Sea.</note> which ſhe was ſo jealous of, that,
tho' ſhe ſupported the <hi>Netherlanders</hi> againſt the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi>
yet would ſhe never conſent, that the <hi>Netherlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
ſhould ſo augment their Sea Forces, as that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they might be able to conteſt with <hi>England</hi> at Sea.
This Maxim, which ſeem'd ſo neceſſary for <hi>England,</hi>
was not regarded by King <hi>James,</hi> he being a lover of
Peace: And King <hi>Charles</hi> I. having always his Hands
full with his Rebellious Subjects, was not in a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
to obſerve it; wherefore the <hi>Dutch</hi> Power at Sea,
could neither by <hi>Cromwel,</hi> nor by <hi>Charles</hi> II. be
brought down again. This moſt glorious, and by her
Subjects, extreamly beloved Queen died in the Year
1602, having before appointed <hi>James</hi> VI. King of

thereby the better to weaken ſo formidable a

Out-work of her Kingdom. Beſides this, ſhe finding
continual employment for her Subjects abroad, did
not a little contribute towards the preſerving the

the Dominion of the <hi>Narrow Seas</hi> with <hi>England,</hi> he
left them to themſelves, and concluding a Peace with
<hi>Spain,</hi> eſtabliſh'd a laſting Tranquility at home, for
his Inclinations were more for Books than Arms. And
becauſe Subjects in general are apt to follow the Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
of their Sovereigns, the People laid aſide all
Warlike Exerciſes, and fell into ſuch Weakneſſes and
Vices, as are commonly the product of Plenty and
Peace: And the King hoped, when theſe Nations ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
themſelves only to Trade and Commerce, they
would be diverted from having any thoughts of oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
his Authority. He made it alſo his main endeavour
to unite the Minds of the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Engliſh,</hi> by Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralizing
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the <hi>Scots</hi> in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and by joining the great Families by Marriages:
But he was more eſpecially carefull of eſtabliſhing one
Form of Religious Worſhip in both Kingdoms.<note place="margin">The Occaſions that were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</note> For
tho' there was no great difference in the Articles of
Faith, yet the Ceremonies and Church Government
were very different. For Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> when ſhe
eſtabliſhed the Proteſtant Religion retained many Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,
which were anciently uſed in the Primitive
Church, as alſo uſed by the Papiſts afterwards; ſhe
maintained alſo the Authority of the Biſhops, yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Royal Power; ſuppoſing that this Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was moſt ſuitable to a Monarchy, conſidering that
the Biſhops had ſome dependence on the King, and
had their Votes in Parliament. And it uſed to be the
ſaying of King <hi>James, No Biſhop, no King.</hi> But this
Conſtitution did not agree with thoſe of the Reform'd
Religion in <hi>Holland, Switzerland</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> partly
becauſe theſe Nations were uſed to a Democratical Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
and therefore loved an Equality in the Church-Government
as well as the State; partly becauſe they
had ſuffered from ſome Kings and Biſhops, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
both were equally hated by them. Theſe would
not allow of any Superiority among the Clergy, but
conſtituted the outward Church-Government by Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries,
Claſſes and Synods; neither would they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
any Ceremonies, believing, that the perfection of
the Reformed Religion did conſiſt in not having ſo
much as anything, tho'never ſo indifferent, common
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:65650:90"/>
with the Papiſts. And according to this Form the
Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> being eſtabliſh'd, the number of
ſuch as were of the ſame Opinion increaſed daily in
<hi>England,</hi> who were commonly called Presbyterians
or Puritans. And the Capriciouſneſs of thoſe who
were of ſeveral Sentiments proved the more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
becauſe theſe Nations being of a melancholy
temper uſed to adhere ſtedfaſtly to their Opinions,
not to be removed from them. King <hi>James</hi> being
beſides a great Enemy of the Puritans, thought to
have found out a way to ſuppreſs them in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
by inſerting it among the Royal Prerogatives, which
was to be confirmed by the Parliament of <hi>Scotland,
That he had the Supream Power both in Spiritual and
Temporal Affairs in the ſame manner in</hi> Scotland <hi>as
in</hi> England. By this means he hoped to model,
without any great difficulty, the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi>
according to that of <hi>England.</hi> And tho' this Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
was oppoſed by a great many in the Parliament
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> yet the King's party prevailed, and a
new Form of Church-Government was eſtabliſhed in
<hi>Scotland.</hi> But the King had no ſooner turned his
back and was return'd into <hi>England,</hi> but the common
people made an Inſurrection againſt the Biſhops in
<hi>Scotland,</hi> who began to introduce there the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>§. 25.<note place="margin">The Conduct of <hi>Charles I.</hi>
                  </note> Tho' King <hi>Charles</hi> I. was of a more war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
temper than his Father, yet was he obliged, tho'
againſt his Will, according to the Maxims of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to preſerve Peace abroad, to avoid the danger of
being oblig'd to depend on the Capricious Humours
of his Subjects. And becauſe he, as well as his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
had a great diſlike of the Power of the common
people, and of the Temper and Principles of the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans,
all his Thoughts were bent to find out ways
how to ſecure himſelf from the danger of both: And
becauſe the King could not impoſe any extraordinary
Taxes without the conſent of the Parliament, <hi>Charles</hi>
choſe rather to controul his own Inclinations, which
were bent for War, than to fawn upon the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
in hopes that its Heats, which was for limiting
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:65650:91"/>
the King's Power, would by degrees diminiſh, if it
was not called together for a conſiderable time. It is
ſuppoſed, that the Lord Treaſurer <hi>Weſton</hi> did confirm
him in this Opinion, who did expect to be call'd to
an account by the Parliament. The Parliament uſed
anciently to provide a certain yearly Revenue for the
King, towards maintaining his Court and Fleet, to
ſecure the Commerce of the Kingdom, which Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
was not hereditary to the next Succeſſour. The
firſt Parliament which was called by <hi>Charles</hi> I. had ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
the Cuſtoms, as part of his Revenue, but when he
afterwards, having diſſolved the ſame againſt the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the Male Contents, his Revenues alſo began to be
call'd in queſtion, it being their Opinion, that nothing
could ſo ſoon oblige the King to call a new Parliament, as
if what was neceſſary for his and the Courts Subſiſtence,
were withheld from him. But the King, however, did
not only receive the ſame Cuſtoms as his Predeceſſours
had done, but alſo augmented them with new Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
to the yearly value of 800000<hi>l.</hi> by which
means the King, who was firm in his Opinion, was
thought to have a Deſign to alter the ancient Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of the Government, and to maintain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
without a Parliament; which however was look'd
upon as an impoſſibility by the generality of them:
For King <hi>James</hi> had left above 1200000<hi>l.</hi> Debts,
which were ſince increaſed by <hi>Charles</hi> 400000<hi>l.</hi> more,
which Money was expended in the Wars againſt
<hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain;</hi> it was therefore not viſible, how
he could extricate himſelf out of theſe Debts without
the aſſiſtance of a Parliament, ſince according to the
fundamental Conſtitutions of the Realm he could not
levy any Taxes upon the Subjects, and to force them
to pay any, was beyond his Power, having no Forces
on foot, but the Militia of the Kingdom. And it
was impoſſible to bring in ſuch a Foreign Force, as
could be ſuppoſed to be able to make Head againſt
the diſſatisfy'd people. Notwithſtanding all which
the King purſued his Reſolution, and having ask'd
the Opinion of Men skill'd in the Law, who told him,
<hi>That it was allowable, for the publick benefit, to levy
Money by his own Authority;</hi> he impoſed ſeveral new
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:65650:91"/>
Taxes, whereby he augmented his yearly Revenue
from 500000<hi>l.</hi> to 800000<hi>l.</hi> Beſides this, he laid a Tax
for maintaining of a Fleet, which amounted to 200000<hi>l.</hi>
All which cauſed great diſſatisfaction among the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
againſt the King: Beſides, the King was thought
by the Puritans, to deal hardly with them and too mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with the Papiſts (by the Counſel of Archbiſhop
<hi>Laud,</hi> a Man of great Reſolution, who at that time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended,
that Faction very dangerous both to Church
and State which was by the Puritans interpreted, as if
the King was reſolved, by ſuppreſſing of them, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce
Popery; to inſinuate this into the Multitude,
abundance of Libels and ſcurrilous Papers were ſcatter'd
abroad againſt the King and the Biſhops, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
being appointed to inquire into them, they
were rather exaſperated than appeas'd by its Severity.</p>
               <p>§. 26. Both Nations being therefore full of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents,<note place="margin">Troubles in <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England.</hi>
                  </note>
the Flame firſt broke out in <hi>Scotland:</hi> For
the King endeavouring to root out Puritaniſm there,
to eſtabliſh the Authority of the Biſhops, and an U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niformity
in Religion, he order'd a Church Liturgy to
be compoſed, abrogating all Presbyteries, Claſſes and
Provincial Synods, and enjoining every one under ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
penalties, to conform to the ſame; there was a
general Inſurrection raiſed by that party in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
There was alſo another reaſon;<note place="margin">1637.</note> for, at the time of the
firſt Reformation the Revenues of a great many
Church Benefices were appropriated to the uſe of the
Crown, but without any remarkable advantage; for
they were lett out, for the moſt part, to younger
Brothers of Noble Families. Theſe having found the
benefit of them, had, by getting from time to time
the Survivorſhip, continued the ſame in their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
and kept them as their own Propriety. Nay,
they did more than this, for during the Minority of
King <hi>James</hi> VI.<note place="margin">1567.</note> they had obtained the Titles of Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
for ſome of the moſt conſiderable of theſe, or
ſome leſſer Benefices joined together. King <hi>James</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
perceiving,<note place="margin">1617.</note> that thereby they had bound him
up from rewarding ſuch with theſe Benefices as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
well of him, would have recall'd the beforeſaid
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:65650:92"/>
Grants, but met with ſuch oppoſition in the Nobility,
that he deſiſted from it.<note place="margin">1633.</note> But the King undertook the
buſineſs effectually, employing the ſaid Revenues to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the augmenting of the Salaries of the Clergy.
Theſe therefore who had been loſers by this Revoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
joined with ſuch Miniſters as were mortal Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> did, with all their might, help to
ſtirr up the Rebellion. <hi>Alexander Leſley,</hi> alſo, who
had been a Commander in the <hi>German</hi> Wars, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
refuſed to ſerve under <hi>John Banniers</hi> there, was
returned into his native Country, in hopes to make
his advantage of theſe Troubles. He put himſelf at
the Head of the Rebellious Party, and by perſuading
the Nobility, that the King intended to take away
their ancient Privileges, ſtirr'd up a great many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the King. And to make a fair ſhew to the
common people, they made uſe of the Religious Cloak
of Conſcience,<note place="margin">The <hi>Scotch</hi> Covenant.</note> ordering a Directory to be compos'd
by the Miniſters quite oppoſite to the former <hi>Liturgy.</hi>
They thereupon enter'd into an Aſſociation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> confirm'd
by ſolemn Oaths, That they would maintain the
ſame againſt all, even the King himſelf: This Aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was called <hi>the Covenant,</hi> which being ſubſcrib'd
by the greateſt part of the Nobility and Clergy, a
Council was conſtituted, unto whom was committed
the ſupream direction of their Affairs. To ſuppreſs
theſe Commotions, the King ſent the Marquiſs of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton</hi>
into <hi>Scotland,</hi> who dealing mildly with them,
only encouraged the adverſe party: For the King cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
a Parliament in hopes to remedy theſe Diſorders,
the Covenant was by its Authority confirm'd, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopal
Authority quite aboliſh'd, and Puritaniſm e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh'd
in defiance of the Royal Authority. There
being then no other way left to reduce the Rebellious
Party to Obedience but force, and the King being in
want both of Money and a ſufficient number of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Subjects, he was forc'd to make ſome uſe of the
Papiſts to obtain both, wherefore he did not only raiſe
an Army, wherein were ſome Papiſts, but alſo was
aſſiſted by them with ſome Summs of Money, all
which, however, was in no ways ſufficient to ſupply
the want of the King; and a Supply being demanded
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:65650:92"/>
from the Subjects, very few, except the King's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
and Officers were for contributing any thing.
And it being divulged, that a great many thouſand of
<hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts and <hi>Germans</hi> were ready for the King's
Service, to try, whether by this way the Subjects
could be frightened out of ſome Money, it ſerved only
to exaſperate the Minds of the people. Yet the King's
Forces might in all probability have been ſucceſsfull a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the <hi>Scots,</hi> if they had fallen upon them imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately.
But becauſe they had leiſure given them,
they did not only ſettle a Correſpondency with <hi>France</hi>
and <hi>Holland,</hi> from whence they were ſupply'd with
Money and Ammunition; but alſo ſent their Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
into <hi>England,</hi> who ſo well knew there to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
the ſtate of their Affairs, that the King being
perſuaded by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> made a diſhonourable A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
with them: Which nevertheleſs did not laſt
long, the Court being aſham'd of the Agreement,
and the <hi>Scots</hi> not truſting the King,<note place="margin">A Letter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted, wherein the <hi>Scots</hi> deſire Succour from <hi>France.</hi>
                  </note> the King had
in the mean while intercepted a Letter, wherein the
<hi>Scots</hi> had ſollicited for ſome Officers and Money to be
ſent them from <hi>France;</hi> this he hoped might prove
an inducement to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to oppoſe the Treachery
of the <hi>Scots,</hi> and to furniſh him with ſome Supplies,
of which he ſtood in great need at that time. He
calling therefore a Parliament,<note place="margin">The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours the <hi>Scots.</hi>
                  </note> the Letter was read,
but to no great purpoſe, the Members of the Houſe of
Commons being moſt of them Puritans, who were
great friends of the <hi>Scots,</hi> ſo that the Parliament was
a little while after diſſolv'd by the King's Authority.
The King had cauſed to be made Priſoner in <hi>London</hi>
the <hi>Scotch</hi> Commiſſioner, who had ſubſcribed the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bovementioned
Letter, whereupon the <hi>Scots</hi> took up
Arms, and took the Caſtle of <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> The
King having with great difficulty, for want of Money,
got together an Army, went in perſon againſt the
<hi>Scots,</hi> but as a party of his Army endeavouring to
force their paſſage was beaten back with loſs, which
augmented the Diſcontents of his Subjects, the
Souldiers for want of Pay, being to be maintained by
thoſe Counties where they were quartered. Beſides
this, ten thouſand Men, which were raiſed by the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:65650:93"/>
Parliament in <hi>Ireland</hi> for the King's ſervice, were
forc'd to be disbanded for want to Pay. There was
then no other remedy left but to make a Truce with
the <hi>Scots,</hi> and to call a new Parliament in <hi>England,</hi>
which began to ſit in <hi>November</hi> in the Year 1640.</p>
               <p>§. 27. But in the Seſſion of this Parliament,<note place="margin">The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> directly oppoſe the King.</note> the
Ulcer which had been long gathering in the Minds of
the people broke out: For the Parliament, in lieu of
aſſiſting the King againſt the <hi>Scots,</hi> enter'd into a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy
with them, promiſing a monthly Subſidy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the maintaining of the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Army, which
was to be ready at the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament's command.
Then they began to reform the States, to clip the
King's Authority, to puniſh his Miniſters and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
and to take away the Biſhops, Liturgy, and
fall upon Papiſts. The better to obtain their aim,
they forced the King to conſent, that he would not
diſſolve the Parliament, till all ſuch as were criminal
were puniſhed, and the State were entirely reformed:
In a word, that they ſhould have the liberty to ſit as
long as they pleaſed. Which in effect put an end to
the Royal Authority. To try the King's Patience,
and their own Strength, they brought, the Earl of
<hi>Strafford,</hi> Lord Deputy of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to his Tryal, who,
notwithſtanding he made a good Defence, and the
King did his utmoſt to preſerve his beloved and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Miniſter, yet the Rabble of <hi>London,</hi> then encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
by the Houſe of Commons, making an Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
he received Sentence of Death in the Houſe
of Lords. And the King refuſing to ſign the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
for his Execution, was obliged thereunto, partly
by the importunity of the Parliament, partly by the
Inſurrection of the Rabble of the City of <hi>London,</hi> and
partly by a Letter from the Earl, deſiring him to do
it. Then the reſt of the King's Miniſters went to
rack, ſome of them ſaving themſelves by flight, ſome
being impriſoned. The Biſhops were excluded from
the Houſe of Lords. The Star-chamber, the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Privy Council, and the High Commiſſion
were ſuppreſſed: the Cuſtoms and power over the Fleet
were taken away from the King. Some of theſe and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:65650:93"/>
ſome other things, which proved very prejudicial to
him, the King was forced to grant them, in hopes
thereby to heal the ulcerated Minds of the people.
He went alſo in perſon into <hi>Scotland,</hi> where he grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them all what they could deſire. About the ſame
time a horrid Conſpiracy broke out among the <hi>Iriſh</hi>
Papiſts, who pretended to maintain the Popiſh Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and to redreſs ſome Grievances by force of Arms,
which occaſioned afterwards a moſt cruel ſlaughter. At
laſt it came to an open Rebellion:<note place="margin">1642.</note> For the Parliament
not ceaſing to encroach daily more and more upon the
Royal Authority,<note place="margin">The Rebellion begins.</note> the King reſolved to aſſert his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
wherefore he ſummoned five Members of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
whom he accuſed as Traitors, and authors of all the
Differences: And the Houſe of Commons taking their
part, the King went into the Houſe accompanied with
ſome Officers, and ſpoke to them with a due reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their Behaviour,<note place="margin">Their Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours</note> which however they made
but little account of, being not ignorant of his want of
Power, of which he ſeem'd to betray himſelf, when he
immediately afterwards condeſcended and came nearer
their Expectations. The Houſe of Commons thereupon
ſtirr'd up the neighbouring Counties, and eſpecially the
<hi>London</hi> Apprentices, who made ſuch an Inſurrection,
that the King, not thinking himſelf ſafe in <hi>London,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd
into the Country. And the Parliament order'd all
the Governours of the Sea-ports, not to obey the King's
Commands. It was certainly a great errour in the
King, that in ſuch troubleſome times, he had not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
care to ſecure to himſelf the Sea-ports, by which
means he might have hoped for ſome aſſiſtance from
abroad: For, when the King intended to poſſeſs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
of the Fort and Harbour of <hi>Hull,</hi> he was not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted;
ſo that there was nothing left, but that the
Parliament had not as yet taken from the King
the diſpoſal of Offices. But for the reſt it was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that their Intention was, to aboliſh totally the
Royal Power, and to introduce a Democracy. And
after the King had once given his Aſſent to the exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the Biſhops from the Houſe of Lords, where
they had ſix and twenty votes, and the reſt of the
King's Friends had once abſented themſelves from both
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:65650:94"/>
Houſes, it was eaſie for the remainder quite to aboliſh
the Authority of the Houſe of Lords. Thus, after
there had been long conteſts by Words and Writings
betwixt both parties, the King now as well as the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
began to Arm themſelves: And the King ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
at ſeveral times, at firſt, beat the Parliament Forces,
the Parliament ſtirr'd up the <hi>Scots,</hi> entring with them
into a Confederacy. Whereupon the <hi>Scots</hi> came with a
conſiderable Force to the aſſiſtance of the Parliament,
which turned the Scale, the King's Forces being rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
near <hi>York,</hi> and he obliged, for want of Men and
Money, to give himſelf up to the protection of the
<hi>Scots,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The King made a Priſoner.</note> who nevertheleſs did ſurrender him to the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
for the Summ of 400000<hi>l.</hi> under condition that
he ſhould not be abuſed by them. The King was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
carried a Priſoner from place to place for a
conſiderable time.</p>
               <p>§. 28. By theſe means the Puritans or Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,<note place="margin">The Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents become Maſters.</note>
had, under the pretext of Religion, overthrown
the Royal Power: But that they could not long en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
their uſurped power, was occaſioned by a certain
Sect that called themſelves <hi>Independent,</hi> becauſe they
would not depend on any certain from of Faith, or
Spiritual, or Temporal Conſtitutions, nor acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
any of the ſame, whereby they opened a door
for all ſorts of Fanaticks, to come under their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.
Theſe, under pretence of a particular holy
Zeal, had not only got a great ſway in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and had been againſt any peaceable accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
propos'd by others; but alſo by their cunning
inſinuating way crept into the chief Civil and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
Employments: For in the place of the Earl of
<hi>Eſſex, Thomas Fairfax</hi> was made General, and <hi>Oliver
Cromwell</hi> Lieutenant General over the Army, the laſt
of which was the Head of the Independents, a ſly and
cunning Fox. And out of this party all vacant places
were ſupply'd in Parliament. The Presbyterians there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
perceiving that the Independents began to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſtrong in the Houſe, and that moſt Military Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments
were in their Hands, propoſed in the Houſe,
That one part of the Army ſhould be ſent into <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:65650:94"/>
that ſome Forces only ſhould be kept in <hi>England,</hi>
and the reſt be disbanded. <hi>Cromwell</hi> made uſe of this
to ſtirr up the Souldiers, telling them, that they were
likely to be disbanded without pay, or elſe to be
ſtarv'd in <hi>Ireland.</hi> Thereupon the Souldiers enter'd
into an Aſſociation among themſelves, taking upon
them not only the Military, but alſo all the Civil
Power, they took the King from the Parliament into
their own cuſtody, pretending they would give him
his liberty, but made themſelves Maſters of the City
of <hi>London,</hi> and acted in every thing at diſcretion. For
they quickly after broke off the Treaty with the King,
and a great many of the Subjects, who were not able
to bear their Tyranny, taking up Arms were diſpers'd
by <hi>Cromwell,</hi> who alſo beat the <hi>Scots</hi> that were come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>England</hi> to the aſſiſtance of the King, making their
General <hi>Hamilton</hi> a Priſoner. But during the abſence of
<hi>Cromwell,</hi> the Parliament had re-aſſumed the Treaty
with the King, and the buſineſs was carried on ſo far,
that there was no ſmall hopes of an Accommodation,
when the Souldiers, headed by <hi>Ireton,</hi> Son-in-law to
<hi>Cromwell,</hi> broke off the Treaty, taking Priſoners ſuch
Members of the Houſe as did oppoſe them: So that
there were not above forty Members left in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

Temporal Matters, for his Subjects were ready to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify
him in moſt reſpects, as having been taught by
Experience, <hi>That the Frogs who deſpiſed to have a

Thoughts that way, <hi>viz.</hi> How to make theſe proud
Merchants more pliable, his hopes being grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
what he had ſeen <hi>Cromwell</hi> do againſt them.
Wherefore he began a War with <hi>Holland,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">War with <hi>Holland,</hi> 1665.</note> which was
carried on at firſt with equal loſſes on both ſides: But
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> at laſt taking a Reſolution to tire out the

with them by the Mediation of <hi>Swedeland,</hi> tho' the great
ſucceſs of the <hi>French</hi> Arms in <hi>Flanders</hi> may probably
have contributed a great deal towards it. Yet it ſeems
as if ever ſince he had kept up a Reſolution of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging
himſelf upon them, he being alſo again exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperated
by the Rable in <hi>Holland,</hi> who affronted him
afterwards. He therefore in the Year 1672 attack'd
the <hi>Dutch</hi> at Sea, whilſt the King of <hi>France</hi> made
War againſt them by Land. But this War did not
ſucceed according to his expectation; for the <hi>Dutch</hi>
did not only take from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> a great number of
Merchant-ſhips, but alſo the <hi>Engliſh</hi> could not maſter
the <hi>Dutch</hi> in any of theſe Sea fights, partly, becauſe
the <hi>French</hi> would not fall on in good earneſt, partly,

§. 31.<note place="margin">Conſtitution of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation.</note> The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation is very populous and
fruitfull: There are ſome who have reckoned, that in
<hi>England</hi> are 9913 Pariſhes, in each Pariſh 80 Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
which make 778183 Families, and ſeven perſons
reckoned to each Family amounts to 6470800 Souls,
among which number it may be ſuppos'd to be above a
Million of Men capable of bearing of Arms. This Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is alſo very fit to ſettle Colonies in Foreign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
becauſe the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as ſoon as they are in the
leaſt ſettled in a place, they quickly marry, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
there for their life time. Whereas other Nations,
if they go into far diſtant Countries, go only with an
intent to get a little Money, which they afterwards
love to ſpend in their Native Country. The <hi>Engliſh</hi>
are alſo Courageous, Brave, not fearing Death. For in
former times their Land forces were much ſuperiour to
the <hi>French,</hi> and ever ſince the times of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi>
when they firſt began to apply themſelves in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
to the Sea, they have not been inferiour in Skill
and Courage to any Nation in the World, except that
the <hi>Dutch</hi> may be compared with them in Sea Affairs.
But this is to be obſerv'd of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Valour, that
they commonly are very Furious and Brave at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
yet great Hardſhip, Famine, and other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies
they are not ſo well able to endure with
Patience, as being us'd to live in great Eaſe and Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in their own Country. Wherefore <hi>Maurice</hi> Prince

They are alſo very dexterous in Woollen and Silk Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacturies,
and are generally great Improvers of
other Arts and Myſteries: Yet they are alſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
Highminded, inclining themſelves to Diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which is the reaſon that they do not ſo much
Work as otherwiſe they might; and yet they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
to be paid for their idle Hours as well as the
reſt, which is the reaſon why they ſell their Wares
at a higher rate than others, and that they envy
ſuch <hi>French</hi> Handycrafts-men, who live among
them, and are ſeldom diverted from their daily La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
by any Pleaſures. They being generally of
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:65650:97"/>
a melancholy temper, makes them very Ingenious,
and when they apply<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> themſelevs to any Science,
they make great progreſs in the ſame, if they hit
the right way. But by the ſame rule, becauſe there
happens often to be an ill mixture of this melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
temper, abundance of Fanaticks and Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſts
are to be found among them, who having form'd
to themſelves Opinions out of ill-grounded Principles,
adhere ſo ſtedfaſt to them, that they are not by any
ways to be removed from them. Wherefore there is
not any Nation under the Sun, where more different
and more abſurd Opinions are to be met withall in
Religion than in <hi>England.</hi> The looſe ſort of people
are addicted to Thieving and Robbing upon the
High-way, wherefore the Hangmen are always buſie
in <hi>England.</hi> This Nation alſo loves to eat and drink
extreamly well; tho' there are ſome who will have it,
that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have got their way of drinking ſo plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully
from the <hi>Netherlanders</hi> in the Wars of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi>
and from thence have brought that ill
Cuſtom over into <hi>England,</hi> which before, they ſay,
was not in uſe there. Their own Hiſtories are ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
evidences, that they have been always inclined to
Rebellion and inteſtine Commotions. Wherefore
their Kings can never be ſecure, except they keep a

neither are they ſo much addicted to their Belly, both
which they have from the barrenneſs of their Native
Country. They are very Revengefull, and inteſtine
Broils among the Noble Families were formerly very
common among them: For it was a cuſtom, that
each Family uſed to ſelect one for the Head of the
Family, unto whom they almoſt paid more reſpect
than to the King himſelf, and if any one of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
had received an Injury, he made complaint
thereof to the Head of his Family: And if the Head
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:65650:98"/>
of the ſame Family did reſolve to revenge the Injury,
the whole Family, under the Conduct of their Head,
fell upon the Family of the Aggreſſour with Fire and
Sword. Which abominable Cuſtom King <hi>James</hi> VI.
did endeavour to aboliſh. Beſides this, they are eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſtirr'd up to Rebellion, very obſtinate in defending
their Opinions to the utmoſt. Their fruitfulneſs in
Children makes them ſeek other Countries, ſince their
Country can ſcarce maintain them all at home. There
is another reaſon alſo to be given for this, which is the
right of the Firſt-born, whereby the eldeſt Son is Heir
of all the real Eſtate of his Father, the reſt of the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
being obliged to be ſatisfy'd with their ſhare in

themſelves as well as they can, apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

from ancient times, have made uſe of this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
and got vaſt Riches by the Fiſhery of Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
and Cods, giving only a ſmall Gratuity to the
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> in caſe they have occaſion to dry their Nets
on their Shores; tho' oftentimes the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> envying
the <hi>Netherlanders,</hi> will force them to pay more than
ordinary, which has ſeveral times ſerved as a pretext
for a War betwixt both Nations. Beſides this, the
Sea is extreamly advantageous to <hi>England,</hi> for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> being ſeparated from their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Nations, cannot eaſily be attack'd; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
they may eaſily invade others: And becauſe this
Iſland is ſituated almoſt in the very middle of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi>
in a narrow Sea, where all Ships which either go
Eaſt or Weſtward muſt paſs by; and having, beſides
this, a very deep Coaſt and commodious Harbour, it
lies moſt convenient for Commerce and Trade, which
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> carry on in moſt parts of the World, and
the <hi>Dutch</hi> hitherto have been the only obſtacle that
they are not become Maſters of the whole Trade of
the World. For it proves very diſadvantageous to
the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that they love to eat and drink well, and
that in great quantity, and by reaſon of their love of
Eaſe, they are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Seamen in their Ships, of what the <hi>Dutch</hi> do; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
this, they will not be contented with a ſmall gain:
Whereas the <hi>Dutch</hi> live very ſparingly, do not refuſe
the Penny, and therefore are eaſier to be dealt withall
than the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> They import a great deal of raw
Silk into <hi>England,</hi> which being wrought in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
mightily encreaſes their Riches. In the ſame
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:65650:99"/>
manner they do with their Woollen Manufactury
now, whereas before the times of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. they
uſed to tranſport moſt of their Wooll into the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,</hi>
where it was wrought, and turn'd to the great
advantage of thoſe Cities. But this King perceiving that
his own Subjects might as well make the ſame benefit of
it, he ſet up the Woollen Manufactury in his Kingdom,
which increaſed prodigiouſly, afterwards, when at the
time of the Troubles in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> a great many
of theſe Weavers did ſettle themſelves in <hi>England.</hi> The
Riches of <hi>England</hi> alſo are, as it ſeems, not a little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed,
becauſe it is not permitted there to any Body to
carry any Gold or Silver of their own Coin out of the
Land, except it be perhaps to the value of ten pound
Sterling for a Traveller. But <hi>Scotland</hi> does not come near
<hi>England,</hi> neither in Fertility nor Riches, having not
any Commodities fit for Exportation, except Salt-fiſh,
Salt, Lead and Coals. The Weſtern and <hi>Orkney</hi>
Iſlands alſo produce nothing but Fiſh. <hi>Ireland</hi> abounds
in Cattel, and eſpecially in Sheep, tho' the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Wooll
is not ſo fine as the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> but for the reſt it is a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
and plentifull Country. In <hi>America</hi> belong to the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Crown, the Iſlands of <hi>Bermudos, Virginia</hi> and
<hi>New England,</hi> and ſome of the <hi>Caribby Iſlands,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have ſent their Colonies, and have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
begun to ſettle themſelves on the Continent of <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana.</hi>
The Product of theſe Countries is chiefly Tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co,
Sugar, Ginger, Indigo and Cotton. They have
alſo a Colony in the Iſland of <hi>Jamaica,</hi> from whence
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Buckaneers and Privateers do great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
to the <hi>Spaniſh Weſt Indies.</hi> For it is a cuſtom
with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> That tho' they are at Peace with the

                  </note> The Conſtitution of the Government in
<hi>England</hi> is chiefly remarkable for this, that the King
cannot act at pleaſure, but in ſome Matters is to take
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:65650:100"/>
the Advice of the Parliament. By this Name is to be
underſtood the Aſſembly of the Eſtates of <hi>England,</hi>
which is divided into the Higher and the Lower Houſe.
In the firſt ſit the Biſhops and the Lords, in the latter
the Deputies of the Cities, and of the 52 Counties
or Shires, into which the whole Kingdom of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
is divided. The firſt origin of the Parliament, as
'tis related, was this, That the former Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
did grant great Privileges to the Lords, by whoſe
aſſiſtance they had conquer'd the Country, and kept
the common people in obedience. But theſe in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
with the Biſhops growing too head-ſtrong,
proved very troubleſome, eſpecially to King <hi>John</hi> and
<hi>Henry</hi> III. wherefore, to ſuppreſs their Inſolence, <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
I. took part with the Commons. And whereas
formerly, out of each County or Shire two Knights and
two Citizens only were call'd, to repreſent their Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances,
which having been debated by the King and
the Houſe of Lords, they uſed to receive an anſwer
and to be ſent home again: This King <hi>Edward</hi> call'd
together the Commons, and conſulted with them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the publick Affairs; tho' there are ſome who
will have their origin to be much more ancient. This
Houſe, after it was once eſtabliſh'd, did extreamly
weaken the Authority of the Lords, and in proceſs of
time did not a little diminiſh the Regal Power; for
ever ſince that time the Rights of the People were
maintained with a high hand, the Houſe of Commons
imagining, that the Sovereignty was lodg'd among
them, and if the Kings refuſed to gratify them in their
Requeſts, they uſed to grumble at their proceedings.
And becauſe the Power of the Parliament is not ſo
much eſtabliſh'd by any ancient Laws as Precedents
and Cuſtoms, this is the reaſon why it is always very
jealous of its Privileges, and always ready to make out
of one ſingle Precedent a right belonging to it ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
This Parliament the King is obliged to call toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as often as any extraordinary Taxes are to be le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy'd
(for the Parliament did aſſign this King, at firſt,
for his ordinary Revenue, 1200000<hi>l. per annum,</hi>
which has been conſiderably augmented ſince) or any
old Laws are to be abrogated, or new ones to be made,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:65650:100"/>
or any alteration to be made in Religion. For con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
theſe matters the King cannot decree any thing
without conſent of the Parliament. The Parliament
alſo uſed to take into conſideration the ſtate of the
Kingdom, and to preſent their Opinion to the King,
yet is the ſame of no force till approved of by the King.
It often alſo calls into queſtion the Miniſters of State,
concerning the Adminiſtration of publick Affairs, and
inflicts Puniſhment upon them, with the King's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation.
And it is a common rule in <hi>England,</hi> that
whatever is committed againſt the Conſtitutions of the
Realm, is done by the Miniſters and Officers; for the
King, they ſay, does never amiſs, but his ill Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
which is not altogether contrary to Truth. But
if the Parliament ſhould pretend to tranſgreſs its
bounds, the King has power to diſſolve it; yet
ought the King alſo to be cautious in this, leſt he ſhould
by an unſeaſonable Diſſolution of the Parliament exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate
the People.</p>

                  </note> If we duely conſider the Condition and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

conſiderable Kingdom, which is able to keep up the
Balance betwixt the Chriſtian Princes in <hi>Europe;</hi> and
which depending on its own Strength, is powerfull e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to defend it ſelf. For, becauſe it is ſurrounded
every where by the Sea, none can make any attempt
upon it, unleſs he be ſo powerfull at Sea, as to be able
entirely to ruine the Naval Forces of <hi>England.</hi> And
if it ſhould happen, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet were quite
defeated, yet would it prove a very hard task, to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
thither ſuch an Army, as could be ſuppos'd to be
ſuperiour to ſo powerfull a Force as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation
is able to raiſe at home. But <hi>England</hi> ought to take
eſpecial care, that it fall not into civil Diſſentions, ſince
it has often felt the effects of the ſame, and the Seeds of
them are remaining yet in that Nation; which chiefly
ariſes from the difference in Religion, and the fierce
Inclinations of this Nation, which makes it very fond
of Alterations. Nevertheleſs a Wiſe and Courageous
King may eaſily prevent this evil, if he does not act a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the general Inclination of the People, maintains
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:65650:101"/>
a good Correſpondency with the Parliament; and for

                  <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> being comprehended in one
Iſland, whoſe chiefeſt Strength lies in a good Fleet, it
is evident, that this King need not make any great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count

or elſe are not very powerfull in Shipping. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
as the King of <hi>England</hi> takes no great notice of

of <hi>Poland</hi> and other ſuch like States; ſo it is eaſie for
him to curb the Pirates on the <hi>Barbary</hi> Coaſt: Which
Neſts of Pirates might have been eaſily deſtroyed long

four, and no Body would touch the Victuals that
came from his Table, which was therefore thrown to

were ſent abroad into the World, and what
was given towards the uſe of this War, was collected

theſe Wars carried off a great many turbulent Spirits:
And a great many of the Nobility uſed either to ſell
or elſe to mortgage their Eſtates; and if any of them
happened to die in the Expedition, leaving no Heirs
behind them, their Eſtates fell to the King. By this
means alſo, that prodigious number of People, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with

diminiſh'd, whereby the Kings got an Opportunity
to deal more eaſily with the reſt. Nevertheleſs, when
afterwards the Kings, either by Inſtigation of the
Popes, or out of their own Inclinations, undertook
theſe Expeditions in their own Perſons, they found
the diſmal effects of it. For, by ſo doing, the beſt of
their Subjects were led to the Slaughter; and yet it
was impoſſible to maintain theſe Conqueſts as long as
they were not Maſters of <hi>Egypt:</hi> Whereas, if this
Kingdom had been made the Seat of the intended

began to favour the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who, in the Year next
following, landed again in <hi>Normandy,</hi> and had great
Succeſs. At laſt the Queen, who had hitherto had a
ſhare in the Government, added Fuel to the Fire:
For the Conſtable <hi>d' Armagnac</hi> having now the ſole Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration
of Affairs, and being only balanc'd by the
Authority of the Queen, took an opportunity, by the
free Converſation of the Queen, to put ſuch a Jealouſie
in the King's Head, that with the Conſent of <hi>Charles</hi>
the Dauphin ſhe was baniſh'd the Court. Which ſo
incenſed the Queen, that ſhe having conceiv'd an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable
Hatred againſt her Son, ſided with the Duke
of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> whoſe Party was thereby greatly
ſtrengthen'd. Thus commenced the inteſtine Wars,
wherein both Parties were ſo exaſperated againſt one
another, that they had little regard to the great Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who, in the mean time conquer'd
all <hi>Normandy</hi> and <hi>Roan</hi> it ſelf.<note place="margin">1419.</note> The Dauphin intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at one blow to root out the Evil of theſe inteſtine
Commotions, cunningly invited the Duke of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy</hi>
to come to an Agreement with him,<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> aſſaſſinated.</note> when at
their ſecond meeting at <hi>Monterau,</hi> he cauſed him to
be kill'd. But this ſtroke had a quite contrary effect:
For the generality of the Nation abominated the fact,
and the Queen took from hence an Opportunity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
to ruin her Son, and to exclude him from the
Succeſſion. Wherefore, entring into a League with
the murther'd Duke's Son <hi>Philip,</hi> a Peace was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
with <hi>Henry</hi> V. King of <hi>England,</hi> by vertue of
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:65650:114"/>
which he was to marry <hi>Catharine,</hi> the Daughter of
<hi>Charles</hi> VI. and during his Life to be Regent of
<hi>France,</hi> and after his Death to be put into the full
poſſeſſion of the Crown of <hi>France;</hi> That both the
Crowns of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi> ſhould be united, yet
that each Kingdom ſhould be ruled according to its
own Laws. Beſides this, a Sentence was pronounc'd
againſt the Dauphin in <hi>Paris,</hi> That by reaſon of the
Murther committed by him upon the Duke of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy,</hi>
he was declared incapable of the Crown, and
that he for ever ſhould be baniſh'd the Kingdom. He
appeal'd from this Sentence to God and his Sword,
and ſet his Court up at <hi>Poictiers,</hi> ſo that at that time
there was in <hi>France</hi> two Governments and two Courts.
But the Affairs of the Dauphin were in a very ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
very few of the Provinces ſiding with him;
thoſe that did, were <hi>Anjou, Poictou, Tours, Auvergne,
Berry</hi> and <hi>Languedock,</hi> but all of them mightily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted
of Money. But it was happy for him, that
the brave King <hi>Henry</hi> V. died in the very Flower of
his Age and good Fortune, as likewiſe did, not long
after,<note place="margin">1422.</note> 
                  <hi>Charles</hi> VI. whoſe Life (by the Infirmities of

his Affairs at the beginning were under very ill

in <hi>Paris,</hi>

<pb n="200" facs="tcp:65650:115"/>
that one time he had nothing for his Dinner
but a piece of roaſted Mutton and a couple of Fowls.
Beſides this, moſt of the great Men about him being
diſſatisfy'd with the ambitious Proceedings of the
Conſtable <hi>Richmond,</hi> had left the Court, and were
driving on their own Intrigues.<note place="margin">Miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> the only Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage <hi>Charles</hi> had left.</note> The only Comfort

<hi>John</hi> Duke of <hi>Brabant,</hi> a Couſin of the Duke of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy,</hi>
was married again to the Duke of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi>
Brother of <hi>Henry</hi> V. The Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> taking
his Couſin's part, it cauſed great Heart-burning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
him and the Duke of <hi>Glouceſter.</hi> The Duke
of <hi>Bedford</hi> endeavour'd to appeaſe them, yet did the
Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> from that time entertain a Grudge
againſt the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> which encreaſed afterwards, when
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> refuſed to put the City of <hi>Orleans</hi> into

which was going to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Camp, having been
entirely beaten: Which Engagement is called <hi>la jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>née
des Haranes,</hi> or, <hi>the Battel of the Herrings.
Charles</hi>'s Affairs were then become ſo deſperate that
he had reſolv'd to retire into <hi>Dauphine,</hi> when upon a
ſudden an unlook'd for help was ſent him: For a
Country Maid born in <hi>Lorraine,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Maid of <hi>Orleans.</hi>
                  </note> whoſe Name was
<hi>Joan,</hi> did pretend that ſhe was ſent from God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve

Both which ſhe effected, ſtriking thereby great ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour

their Affairs from henceforward mend every day. But

                  </note> The <hi>Engliſh,</hi> perceiving

to give them new Life and Vigour, by bringing over
the young King <hi>Henry,</hi> and having him crowned in
<hi>Paris:</hi> And to keep fair with the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi>
they gave him the Counties of <hi>Brie</hi> and <hi>Champaigne;</hi>
yet all this proved inſufficient. The War therefore
having been thus carried on for ſeveral Years only
with light Skirmiſhes, both Parties being tir'd out, a
Treaty was at laſt propos'd by Mediation of the Pope
at <hi>Arras;</hi> but the <hi>Engliſh</hi> rigorouſly inſiſting upon
their Pretenſions, which were very hard, they were
deſerted by the Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> who made a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Peace with <hi>Charles</hi> upon very advantageous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.

                  <note place="margin">1435.</note> who hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
had adminiſtred the Affairs in <hi>France</hi> with
great Prudence. After this the Cities of <hi>France</hi> ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render'd
themſelves one after another to <hi>Charles;</hi>
among which was <hi>Paris,</hi> which ſubmitted it ſelf to
its natural Lord.<note place="margin">1436.</note> But becauſe the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had made
miſerable havock throughout <hi>France,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi>
Souldiers themſelves being ill paid, had committed
great Depredations, without any Order or Diſcipline,
a great Famine enſu'd, and afterwards a great Plague.
It is related that the Wolves did ſnatch the Children
out of the Streets of the Suburbs of St. <hi>Anthony</hi> in
<hi>Paris.</hi> The War having been thus protracted for a
conſiderable time, a Truce was concluded for ſome
Years. The King, to be rid of the Souldiers, ſent
them into <hi>Alſace,</hi> under pretence to diſturb the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
at <hi>Baſil.</hi> They killed at once 4000 <hi>Swiſs,</hi> but
having loſt double the number ſoon after, returned
home again. In the mean time the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated
from their former Valour, their Forces
were extreamly diminiſh'd in <hi>France,</hi> and the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
for want of Pay had given themſelves over to
Plunder. They wanted good Officers, their Places
were not well provided, and their Subjects weary of
the Government. <hi>England,</hi> at home, was divided
within it ſelf, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> weakened by two O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrows,
which they had received from the <hi>Scots.
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:65650:116"/>
Charles</hi> therefore having met with this Opportunity,
reſolv'd to beat the <hi>Engliſh</hi> at once out of <hi>France.</hi>
He took, for a Pretence of the War, that they had
broken the Truce in <hi>Britainy</hi> and with the <hi>Scots;</hi> and
attacking them with great Vigour in ſeveral places at
once,<note place="margin">He drives the <hi>Engliſh</hi> out of <hi>France,</hi> 1449.</note> he drove them, within the ſpace of thirteen

<hi>French</hi> Crown,<note place="margin">1453.</note> after it had been 300 Years in the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> Thus did this King re-unite the
mangled Kingdom, having expell'd the <hi>Engliſh</hi> out
of its Bowels. Nevertheleſs he did not entirely enjoy
the Fruits of his good Fortune, living at variance
with his Son, who for the ſpace of thirteen Years came
not to Court. And being at laſt perſuaded, that a

reſolute and malicious Prince, who laid the firſt Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation

was kept under by the Authority of the great Men of
the Kingdom.<note place="margin">He reduces the exceſſive pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</note> He began with reforming his Court

wherewith they pretended to defend the Publick a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the King's arbitrary Proceedings. Among theſe
were the Dukes of <hi>Burgundy</hi> and <hi>Britainy,</hi> who were
willing to keep the King within bounds. In the Year
1465, <hi>Charles,</hi> the young Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> enter'd
<hi>France</hi> with an Army, and fought a Battel with the
King near <hi>Montlehery,</hi> wherein the Advantage was

was paſs'd, he revok'd at pleaſure. To diſſolve the

ruined by his Policy, eſpecially by bribing their Friends

Lewis</hi> taking advantage of the great Confuſion, which

under pretext that the ſame was an Appanage, and

'Tis ſaid, that the firſt Cauſe of this Difference
was, becauſe the Duke of <hi>Bourbon</hi> had refus'd to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

with the Emperor and the King of <hi>England,</hi> That

This <hi>Bonnivet</hi> perſuaded the King to go in Perſon into

well, he ſhould have the Glory of having been the
Adviſer, but if they ſucceeded ill, the Misfortune would
be cover'd by the King's Perſon. <hi>Francis</hi> therefore
went with a good Reſolution into <hi>Italy,</hi> becauſe he
ſaw the Duke of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> who in the mean time ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

for two Months together harraſs'd his Army in that

pretended, That what had been done was done

upon him the Government of his Native City
<hi>Genoua,</hi> and to reſtore to the <hi>Genoueſe, Savona.</hi> This
<hi>Doria</hi> is deſervedly praiſed, for that, when he might
have been Lord of his Native Country, he choſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to procure its Liberty, which it enjoys to this

that the City of <hi>Naples</hi> could not be cut off of

to reign in the Army during this long Siege, which
devoured the greateſt part of it, and the General him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
The Remnants of the Army were miſerably
treated, the Officers being made Priſoners, and the

from the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> which took <hi>Guiſe,</hi> but

attack'd the Emperour with five ſeveral Armies at

But the King could not proſecute his Victory,
being obliged to recall his Troops, becauſe the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour

engaged in a War againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> and the <hi>German</hi>
Princes being very jealous of his Greatneſs, <hi>Henry</hi>
thought to have met with a fit Opportunity to break
with him. He began therefore in the <hi>Netherlands</hi>
and <hi>Piedmont;</hi> and having made an Alliance with
<hi>Maurice</hi> Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His Expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> 1552.</note> he marched with his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my

Cities of <hi>Metz, Toul</hi> and <hi>Verdun,</hi> and would have
done the ſame with <hi>Strasbourgh,</hi> if they had not been
upon their Guard there. But the Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi>
having made a Peace with the Emperour without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
the King, and ſome Princes intreating him
not to advance farther into the Empire he marched
back into the Country of <hi>Luxembourgh,</hi> where he took
ſome Places. The Emperour then beſieged <hi>Metz</hi> with
an Army of 100000 Men, but the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
himſelf ſo bravely, that the Emperour was
obliged to raiſe the Siege with great loſs. To revenge
this Affront, he attack'd <hi>Terouëne</hi> in <hi>Artois</hi> with great
Fury, and raſed to the Ground this Fortreſs, which
had proved hitherto ſo troubleſome to the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands.</hi>
The ſame he did to <hi>Heſdin,</hi> both the Garriſons
being put to the Sword. On the other ſide the <hi>French</hi>
took <hi>Siena</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> and ſeveral Places in the Iſland of
<hi>Corſica,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1555.</note> but were again beaten out of <hi>Siena,</hi> after they

                  </note> In the Year 1556,
a Truce was concluded at <hi>Vaucelles</hi> near <hi>Cambray,</hi> the
Emperour being deſirous to leave the Kingdom to his
Son (to whom he had ſurrender'd the ſame) in Peace.
But the Truce was ſcarce confirm'd by Oath, when
the <hi>French,</hi> upon the Inſtigation of Pope <hi>Paul</hi> IV.
broke the ſame again, who having ſome Differences
with <hi>Spain</hi> perſuaded <hi>Henry</hi> to take his part. The
Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> was therefore ſent into <hi>Italy</hi> with an
Army, but did nothing worth mentioning. In the
mean time King <hi>Philip</hi> had gathered an Army of 50000
Men, hoping thereby to eſtabliſh his Reputation in
the beginning of his Reign, and having alſo drawn
<hi>England</hi> into the War, he beſieged St. <hi>Quintin,</hi> into
which place the Admiral <hi>Gaſpar Coligny</hi> had thrown
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:65650:123"/>
himſelf. The Conſtable <hi>Montmorency</hi> advanced with
an Army to the Relief of the Place, but retreating a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
in ſight of the Enemies, they fell upon him, and
gave him a terrible Defeat.<note place="margin">1557.</note> 
                  <hi>France</hi> had been then in
the utmoſt danger, if this Victorious Army had
march'd directly towards <hi>Paris,</hi> and if the Enemies
Deſign upon <hi>Lyons</hi> had not miſcarry'd. But King <hi>Philip</hi>
feared leaſt the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who commanded his

to <hi>France</hi> upon ſome advantageous Conditions;
wherefore he would not let him march on far into the
Country, but took St. <hi>Quintin</hi> by Storm, and loſt his
Time in the taking of <hi>Han, Chaſtelet</hi> and <hi>Noyon.</hi> This
gave leiſure to the <hi>French</hi> to recollect themſelves, and

                  <note place="margin">The Cauſes of the inteſtine Wars of <hi>France.</hi>
                  </note> Concerning the Cauſes of theſe
Inteſtine Wars, it is to be obſerv'd, That after the
Houſe of <hi>Valois</hi> came to the Crown, the next in
Blood were thoſe of the Houſe of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> which
Houſe was grown ſo Potent, by its Riches, Power
and Authority of a great many brave Perſons, which
deſcended from it, that the preceding Kings were
grown extreamly jealous of it. And, tho' <hi>Francis</hi> I.
at the beginning of his Reign did conſtitute the Duke
of <hi>Bourbon</hi> Conſtable; yet being ſoon convinced af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
of the Reaſons which had induc'd his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors
to keep under this Houſe, he us'd all his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to humble the ſaid <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Bourbon.</hi> For
this Reaſon he enter'd into a Conſpiracy againſt <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis,</hi>
which having been diſcover'd, he went over to
<hi>Charles</hi> V. and commanded as General in the Battel
near <hi>Pavia,</hi> where <hi>Francis</hi> was taken Priſoner, and
was ſlain in the ſtorming of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1527.</note> By his Death the
Houſe of <hi>Bourbon</hi> receiv'd a great blow, thoſe who
were left being look'd upon with a very ill Eye, tho'
they kept themſelves very quiet to extinguiſh the Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion
and Hatred conceiv'd againſt them. The Houſe
of <hi>Bourbon</hi> being thus brought very low, the two
Houſes of <hi>Montmorency</hi> and <hi>Guiſe</hi> held up their Heads
under the Reign of <hi>Francis</hi> I. The firſt was one of
the moſt ancient in <hi>France;</hi> the latter was a Branch
of the Houſe of <hi>Lorrain.</hi> The Head of the firſt was
<hi>Annas Montmorency,</hi> Conſtable of <hi>France;</hi> of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Claude</hi> Duke of <hi>Guiſe.</hi> Both of them were in
great Favour and Authority with <hi>Francis</hi> I. but both
fell into Diſgrace at the latter end of his Reign, being
baniſh'd the Court. It is related of <hi>Francis</hi> I. that
juſt before his Death he adviſed his Son <hi>Henry</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:65650:124"/>
with neither of them in his Affairs, ſince too great
and too able Miniſters proved often dangerous. Yet
notwithſtanding this, <hi>Henry</hi> II. did receive both <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas
Montmorency</hi> and <hi>Francis de Guiſe,</hi> the Son of
<hi>Claude,</hi> into his particular Favour; who quickly grew
jealous of one another, the firſt taking much upon
him becauſe of his Experience in State Affairs, and
Gravity, the latter being puff'd up with the Glory of
Martial Exploits,<note place="margin">The Houſe of <hi>Guiſe</hi> riſes, and that of <hi>Bourbon</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines.</note> and the Applauſe of the People; the
Authority of the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> was greatly encreas'd
after he had repuls'd <hi>Charles</hi> V. from before <hi>Metz,</hi>
and taken <hi>Calais;</hi> whereas the unfortunate Battel
fought near St. <hi>Quintin,</hi> and the enſuing diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Peace were very prejudicial to <hi>Montmorency,</hi>
But the Houſe of <hi>Guiſe</hi> got the greateſt Advantage,
after <hi>Francis</hi> II. had marry'd <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
whoſe Mother was Siſter to the Duke of <hi>Guiſe:</hi> So
that during the Reign of <hi>Francis</hi> II. the Duke of
<hi>Guiſe</hi> and the Cardinal his Brother, were the Men
that bore the greateſt Sway in the Kingdom; which
extreamly exaſperated <hi>Montmorency</hi> and the two Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of <hi>Bourbon, Anthony</hi> King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and the
Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> ſeeing themſelves thus neglected.
And tho' <hi>Anthony</hi> was of a very modeſt Behaviour,
watching only an Opportunity to regain his Kingdom
of <hi>Navarre</hi> from the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and having a ſufficient
Revenue out of his Country of <hi>Bearn,</hi> wherewithal to
maintain himſelf; yet the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> was Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
Poor, and of a turbulent Spirit, who was not able
to maintain his Grandeur without ſome conſiderable
Employment. Beſides this, he was continually ſtirr'd up
by the Admiral <hi>Gaſpar Coligny,</hi> an ambitious, cunning
and fly Man; who, as his Enemies will have it, was very
forward to fiſh in troubled Waters; his Brother <hi>d' An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delot</hi>
alſo being of a very wild and turbulent Spirit.
Theſe three only watch'd an Opportunity to raiſe
Commotions in the Kingdom. Thus the great Men
of the Kingdom were divided into theſe ſeveral Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
at the Time when <hi>Francis</hi> II. began his Reign, a
Prince ſcarce ſixteen Years old, weak both in Body
and Mind, and therefore incapable to rule the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
by himſelf. Several therefore pretended to have
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:65650:125"/>
a right to the Adminiſtration of the Government,<note place="margin">Diviſions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note>
theſe of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> as being the next Princes of the
Blood; the Houſe of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> as being nearly related to
the Queen, and the Queen Mother <hi>Catharine de Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicis,</hi>
the very pattern of an aſpiring and cunning Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
hoped, That whilſt the Princes were in conteſt
about the Adminiſtration of the Government, it would
fall to her ſhare, wherefore ſhe always fomented the
Diviſions, by keeping up the Balance betwixt them.
This <hi>Catharine</hi> firſt ſided with the Houſe of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
the Adminiſtration of Affairs with them, ſo
that ſhe was to have the Supream Adminiſtration, the
Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> was to manage the Military Affairs,
and his Brother the Cardinal the Finances. This A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
being made betwixt them, the Conſtable,
under pretence of his old Age was diſmiſs'd from Court,
and the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> ſent as Ambaſſadour into <hi>Spain.</hi>
Theſe, who were thus excluded, had a meeting, to
conſider which way they might free themſelves from
theſe Oppreſſions, where it was reſolv'd that the King
of <hi>Navarre</hi> ſhould intercede for them at Court; who
being put off with fair words and empty Promieſs, ſet
himſelf at reſt. <hi>Conde</hi> was reſolv'd to try his Fortune
by force; but having not a ſufficient Intereſt, <hi>Coligny</hi>
adviſed him, he ſhould ſide with the <hi>Huguenots</hi> (for ſo

Beſides that, they mortally hated thoſe of <hi>Guiſe,</hi>

of this Deſign was undertaken by a certain Gentleman

pretended to be no Enemy to the Proteſtant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

The firſt occaſion of it was given by ſome

neither to ſpeak of all the ſmall Skirmiſhes which are
innumerable, nor the Cruelties committed on both

In this firſt War the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> died of a Wound,

                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:65650:126"/>
a bloody Battel was fought, where <hi>Conde</hi> at firſt had
the Advantage, but his Souldiers falling to plundring,
he was beat back again, he himſelf being made a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner,
and the Mareſchal St. <hi>Andrew</hi> being kill'd by a
Shot, 8000 Men were ſlain upon the Spot, and the Loſs
near equal on both ſides; the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> kept the
Field, but was afterwards, at the Siege of <hi>Orleans,</hi> trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherouſly
murther'd by one <hi>Poltrot,</hi> with a Piſtol-ſhot,
who was ſuppoſed to have committed the Fact by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigation
of <hi>Coligny.</hi> Soon after a Peace was made.
It is related,<note place="margin">1563.</note> that above 50000 <hi>Huguenots</hi> were ſlain
in this War; on the other ſide, they took the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate
and Ornaments, which they having turn'd into
Money, Silver was after this War more currant in
<hi>France</hi> than before. But <hi>Catharine</hi> had perſuaded her
ſelf, that both Parties were reduc'd to that Condition,
that ſhe could now handle them at pleaſure. After
the Peace was concluded the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were again beaten
out of <hi>Havre de Grace,</hi> which the <hi>Huguenots</hi> had given
them as an Acknowledgment for their Aſſiſtance. This
Peace laſted no longer than till the Year 1576, when the
<hi>Huguenots</hi> were perſuaded, that at the interview betwixt
<hi>Catharine</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Alba</hi> at <hi>Bayonne,</hi> a League was
ſet on foot for rooting out the Hereticks: And in effect,
they were immediately after more ſeverely dealt with,
and, as it was reported, the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligny</hi>
were to be ſecur'd.<note place="margin">The Second War.</note> The <hi>Huguenots</hi> therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan

was very troubleſome to him; <hi>He ſhould let him be at
quiet, ſince during the Time of</hi> 80 <hi>Years that he had
liv'd, he had learn'd how to employ one quarter of an
Hour in dying.</hi> The <hi>Huguenots</hi> got great Reputation
for Valour in this Engagement, they being much In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
to the other in Number. About the ſame time
the City of <hi>Rochelle</hi> declar'd for the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> which
afterwards for 60 Years together ſerv'd them for a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
Retreat.<note place="margin">1568.</note> Then a ſecond Peace was concluded,
not with an Intention to keep it, but that each Party
might find a better Opportunity to take Advantage
of one another; nor were the Conditions ever fulfill'd.
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:65650:126"/>
The War therefore was renewed in the ſame Year,<note place="margin">The Third War</note> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
which the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> was kill'd by a Shot,<note place="margin">1569.</note> in

He in vain beſieged <hi>Poictiers,</hi> in the Defence of which
Place the young Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> gave the firſt proofs of his
Valour; he was alſo ſoundly beaten near <hi>Moncontour,</hi>
where he loſt 9000 Foot. He loſt nevertheleſs nothing
of his former Reputation, for he quickly recollected
his broken Troops, and got together a great Army,
being aſſiſted by Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> with Money, and
by the <hi>Paltzgrave</hi> with Souldiers.<note place="margin">1570.</note> He directed his
March towards <hi>Paris,</hi> whereupon a Peace was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
to the great Advantage of the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> the
four ſtrong Cities of <hi>Rochelle, Montauban, Cagnac</hi> and
<hi>Charité</hi> being given them for their Security: But the
main deſign of this Peace was, that the King per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving,
that the <hi>Huguenots</hi> could not be ſuppreſs'd
by Force, hop'd he might win them by Policy, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
endeavour'd by fair Words and great Promiſes to
make them ſecure. The Admiral was careſs'd at Court,
he being conſulted withall concerning an Expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to be undertaken againſt the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands.</hi>
A Marriage alſo was concluded betwixt
<hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>Navarre</hi> and <hi>Margaret</hi> the King's Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
to which Wedding they invited the chief of the
<hi>Huguenots,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The <hi>Pariſian</hi> Maſſacre,</note> with a Deſign to cut their Throats in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.</hi>
And firſt of all the Admiral <hi>Coligny,</hi> as he was
going home from Court, was by ſorne Villains, who
were ſuborn'd by the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> ſhot with two
Bullets through the Arm. Then it was agreed, That
in the Year 1571, on the 24th Day of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> early
in the Morning, when the Bells were ringing to Prayers,
all the <hi>Huguenots</hi> ſhould be maſſacred, except the
King of <hi>Navarre</hi> and the young Prince of <hi>Conde:</hi>
The Execution of this Enterprize the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi>
had taken upon himſelf. The beginning of whoſe
Maſſacre was made with <hi>Coligny,</hi> who was ill of his
Wounds; then it fell promiſcuouſly upon the reſt,
the Fury of the Mob not ceaſing till after ſeven Days
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:65650:127"/>
ſlaughter. A great many other Cities of <hi>France</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
the Example of <hi>Paris,</hi> ſo that within few Days
near 30000 were miſerably maſſacred. The King of
<hi>Navarre</hi> and Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> were forc'd to abjure
the Reformed Religion. This was the ſo much cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
<hi>Pariſian</hi> Wedding, which <hi>Gabriel Naude</hi> would
fain repreſent us a State's Trick, but this is, in my
Opinion,<note place="margin">The Fourth War.</note> a very groſs way of arguing. Nevertheleſs
the <hi>Huguenots</hi> did quickly recollect themſelves, after
the firſt Conſternation was over, renewing the War
with great Animoſity and Revenge. During this
War the King's Army beſieged <hi>Rochelle</hi> near eight
Months together, and having loſt 12000 Men before
it, News was brought, That the Duke <hi>d' Anjou</hi> was
elected King of <hi>Poland.</hi> Hence an Opportunity was
taken to raiſe the Siege with ſome Reputation, and to
make a Peace the fourth time with the <hi>Huguenots;</hi>
by vertue of which,<note place="margin">1573.</note> the Cities of <hi>Rochelle, Montau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi>
and <hi>Niſmes</hi> were given them for their Security.
But immediately,<note place="margin">The Fifth War.</note> in the Year next following, the fifth
War commenc'd; at which time alſo a third Faction
aroſe in <hi>France,</hi> which was call'd, <hi>that of the Politici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi>
they pretended, without having any regard to
the Religious Differences, to ſeek the publick Welfare,
to have the Queen remov'd from the Adminiſtration
of the Government, and the <hi>Italians</hi> and thoſe of
<hi>Guiſe</hi> to be baniſh'd the Kingdom of <hi>France.</hi> The
Heads of this Faction were thoſe of the Houſe of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morency,</hi>
who intended, during theſe Troubles, to
play their own Game. Theſe were afterwards very
inſtrumental in helping <hi>Henry</hi> IV. to the Crown.
During theſe Troubles <hi>Charles</hi> IX. died, leaving no
legitimate Iſſue behind him.</p>
               <p>§. 21.<note place="margin">Henry III.</note> After the Death of <hi>Charles</hi> IX. the Crown
fell to <hi>Henry</hi> III. who was at that time in <hi>Poland,</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
whoſe abſence his Mother <hi>Catharine</hi> govern'd the
Kingdom, which was in a very confus'd Eſtate. He
left <hi>Poland</hi> privately, and taking his Way by <hi>Vienna</hi>
and <hi>Venice,</hi> arriv'd ſafely in <hi>France.</hi> But after he had
taken upon him the Adminiſtration of Affairs, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
every body in thoſe Hopes which were conceiv'd
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:65650:127"/>
of him before. For he being addicted only to his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
and Idleneſs, was led away by his Favourites,
leaving the chief Adminiſtration of the Kingdom to
his Mother. The <hi>Huguenots</hi> Power encreas'd re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably
after the Duke of <hi>Alenſon,</hi> the Kings Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
ſided with them, and <hi>Conde</hi> and the <hi>Paltzgrave,
John Caſimir,</hi> led an Army out of <hi>Germany</hi> into
<hi>France;</hi> beſides that, the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> found
means to make his eſcape out of Priſon. The fifth
Peace was therefore concluded with the <hi>Huguenots,</hi>
whereby they obtain'd very advantageous Conditions.
About the ſame time a new Faction was ſet up,<note place="margin">The Holy League.</note>
which was compos'd of a great many ſmall ones,
this was call'd <hi>The holy <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> or <hi>League,</hi> which
reduc'd <hi>France</hi> to the moſt miſerable Condition that
could be. The chief promoter of it was <hi>Henry</hi> Duke
of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> who, perceiving, that the great Authority
which he had among the People, made him to be ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the King, endeavour'd to make a Party of his
own. He made uſe eſpecially of the Prieſts and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
People of <hi>Paris;</hi> among whom the Name of the
<hi>Guiſes</hi> was in great Veneration. He was encouraged
to undertake this Deſign, becauſe the King was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpis'd
by all, and the Women by their Intrigues, rul'd
at Court. Beſides this, he pretended to be deſcended
from the Race of <hi>Charles the Great,</hi> which was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
unjuſtly from the Crown by <hi>Hugh Capet.</hi> The
Pretence of this League was the Catholick Religion;
and there was a Draught made of this League, which
contain'd chiefly three things, <hi>viz. The Defence of the
Catholick Religion; the Eſtabliſhment of</hi> Henry III. <hi>in
the Throne, and the maintaining the Liberty of the
Kingdom, and the Aſſembly of the States.</hi> Thoſe who
enter'd into this League promis'd to be obedient to
ſuch Head or General as ſhould be choſen for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of this League, all which was confirm'd by
Oath. At the firſt ſetting up of this League the King
conniv'd at it, hoping thereby the ſooner to ſubdue
the <hi>Huguenots;</hi> nay, he himſelf ſubſcrib'd the ſame at
the Dyet at <hi>Blois,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1577.</note> declaring himſelf the Head of this
League.<note place="margin">The Sixth War.</note> Then the ſixth War was begun againſt the
<hi>Huguenots,</hi> but the King made Peace with them the
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:65650:128"/>
ſame Year, notwithſtanding that they were in a very
ill Condition, neither was any thing done worth men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning
in this War. The War being ended, the
King returning to his Pleaſures, confounded great
Summs of Money, and therefore laid new and heavy
Impoſitions upon the People, and his Favourites grew
very Inſolent; which increas'd the Hatred againſt
him, and at the ſame time the Reſpect and Love of
the People to thoſe of <hi>Guiſe.</hi> Beſides this, the Duke
of <hi>Alenſon,</hi> the King's Brother, declaring himſelf
Lord of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Spain</hi> enters the League.</note> 
                  <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Spain</hi> was
provoked to revenge himſelf of the <hi>French,</hi> and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
the League.<note place="margin">The Seventh War.</note> In the Year 1579 the Seventh War
was begun againſt the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> wherein alſo they
ſucceeded very ill. Notwithſtanding this the King
made a Peace with them in the Year next following
he being unwilling that they ſhould be quite rooted
out, for fear that the League might prove too ſtrong
for himſelf. The <hi>German</hi> Horſe were alſo much fear'd,
and the Duke of <hi>Alenſon</hi> was very forward to have
the Peace concluded, that he might be at leiſure to
employ his Forces in the <hi>Netherlands.</hi> This Peace
laſted five Years, during which time the Hatred againſt
the King increas'd daily, becauſe of the heavy Taxes
which were devour'd by his Favourites. He made
himſelf alſo the more deſpis'd by playing too much
the Hypocrite, and by transforming himſelf almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Monk. The <hi>French</hi> Glory was alſo much eclips'd,
when the Duke of <hi>Alenſon</hi> behav'd himſelf ſo ill in
the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> Fleet which was ſent
to the Aſſiſtance of <hi>Anthony</hi> the Baſtard, was totally
ruin'd near <hi>Tercera.</hi> But the League grew very
ſtrong after the Death of the Duke of <hi>Alenſon,</hi> the
King's younger Brother, the King having no hopes
of any Iſſue of his Body: Then it was that the Duke
of <hi>Guiſe</hi> propos'd to himſelf no leſs than the Crown,
tho' he for a colour ſet up the Cardinal of <hi>Bourbon,</hi>
thereby to exclude the King of <hi>Navarre.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it was ſuſpected that the King favour'd the King
of <hi>Navarre,</hi> the Prieſts began to thunder in the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits,
and to make horrid Exclamations, that the
Catholick Religion was loſt; the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:65650:128"/>
into a Confederacy with <hi>Philip,</hi> who was to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
great Summs of Money under pretext of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the Catholick Religion, and to aſſiſt the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
of <hi>Bourbon</hi> in obtaining the Crown; but in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
this Intention was to uphold the Diviſions in
<hi>France,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1585.</note> thereby to diſenable it to take part with the
<hi>Netherlands.</hi> Then the Leaguers began to break out
into an open War; and having taken a great many
Towns, oblig'd the King, according to their Demands,
to forbid the Exerciſe of the Proteſtant Religion in
<hi>France.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Eighth War.</note> And ſo began the Eighth War againſt the
<hi>Huguenots,</hi> and if the King had been in earneſt to ruin
them, they would have been in a very ill Condition:
For tho' the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> beat the Duke <hi>de Joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euſe</hi>
near <hi>Coutras,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1587.</note> yet did he not proſecute his Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
And about the ſame time the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers'd
the <hi>German</hi> and <hi>Swiſs</hi> Forces, which under the
Command of <hi>Fabian de Dona</hi> were marching to the
Aſſiſtance of the <hi>Huguenots.</hi> This Army, being deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of a good Commander was miſerably maul'd,
and the reſt ſent home in a very ſhamefull Condition.
This Victory acquir'd the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> great Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe
and Favour among the People, and ſtill leſſen'd
the Value of the King's Perſon; ſo that the Prieſts now
did not ſtick to exclaim againſt the King in their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
calling him <hi>a Tyrant.</hi> The King therefore ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
reſolv'd with himſelf to puniſh the Heads of the

                  <note place="margin">The League force the King from <hi>Paris.</hi>
                  </note> they broke out into open Rebellion,
and having ſent for the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> as their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector,
the King was oblig'd to leave <hi>Paris</hi> by Night:
But the King perceiving that more Cities ſided daily
with the League,<note place="margin">1588.</note> and deſpairing to overcome them by
Force, took another Courſe to obtain his Ends, and
made an Agreement with the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> with
great Advantages on his and the Leaguers ſide: He
pretended alſo to have forgotten all paſt Injuries, on
purpoſe to inveigle the Duke of <hi>Guiſe.</hi> And under
theſe ſpecious pretences he got him to appear at the
Aſſembly of the Eſtates at <hi>Blois.</hi> In the mean time the

                  </note> the King caus'd the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi>

put thoſe of the League into a Rage, and with the
Aſſiſtance of the Prieſts, the King was in <hi>Paris</hi> publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
declar'd to have forfeited the Crown. Moſt of the
great Cities of <hi>France</hi> being ſtirr'd up by the Example
of the <hi>Pariſians</hi> did the ſame, declaring the Duke <hi>de

Head of the League; who endeavour'd, but
in vain,<note place="margin">The King makes uſe of the <hi>Hugue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots</hi> againſt the League.</note> to ſurprize the King in <hi>Tours.</hi> The King
then being overpower'd by the League, and beſides
this, excommunicated by the Pope, was oblig'd to
make an Agreement with the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> and
to make uſe of the <hi>Huguenots.</hi> And having got toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

a Reſolution to reduce that City to Obedience by
Force of Arms: But the day before the general Attack
was to be made, one <hi>James Clement,</hi> a <hi>Jacobin</hi> Monk,
brought a Letter out of the City directed to the King,
which whilſt he deliver'd, pretending to whiſper the

<hi>the King of</hi> Navarre, and, who was the firſt of the
Houſe of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> did at the beginning of his Reign,
meet with no leſs Difficulties than he had met with
before. For tho' he was lawfull Heir to the Crown,
yet the Proteſtant Religion, which he profeſs'd, was
no ſmall obſtacle, for as long as he was addicted to
that, the League, the Pope, and <hi>Spain,</hi> would que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſs
oppoſe him with all their might: But if he

promis'd him Obedience after ſeveral Conteſts,
under Condition, that within ſix Months he would

But becauſe <hi>Henry</hi> would not be bound to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
certain time, but only gave them ſome Hopes in
general terms, it was agreed, That the <hi>Huguenots</hi>
ſhould enjoy the free Exerciſe of their Religion, yet
that the Catholick Religion ſhould be re-eſtabliſh'd
in all Cities, and the Revenues reſtor'd to the Clergy.
But, thoſe of the League, becauſe the Duke of <hi>Maine</hi>
at that time durſt not take upon him the Title of
King, proclaim'd the Cardinal of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> an ancient
decrepid Man, Uncle to King <hi>Henry,</hi> and who was
then in Cuſtody, their King, declaring the Duke <hi>de

the Catholick Princes, except <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Florence.</hi>
But the Heads were not very unanimous, and the
Duke <hi>de Maine</hi> had not Authority enough to keep
them in Unity. But on the King's ſide were almoſt
all the Nobility, the whole Court of the deceas'd King,
all the Proteſtant Princes and States, the old <hi>Hugue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not</hi>
Troops, who had done great Service to <hi>Henry,</hi>
and would ſtill have done more, if they had not
miſtruſted him, that he would change his Religion.
Each Party watch'd an Opportunity of ſurprizing one
another. The Duke of <hi>Maine</hi> endeavouring to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
the King near <hi>Diep,</hi> was bravely repuls'd, which
ſeem'd to be ominous to the League. On the other
Hand, the King could not get <hi>Paris</hi> tho' he had taken
the Suburbs. But <hi>Henry</hi> was not only peſter'd by the
League, but alſo for want of Money, was oblig'd to
keep up his Party with fair Words and Promiſes.
The <hi>Spaniards</hi> alſo began to intermeddle publickly in
the Affairs of <hi>France,</hi> in hopes in this Juncture either
to conquer the Kingdom, or to divide it, or at leaſt
to weaken it. But the Duke <hi>de Maine</hi> did under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
oppoſe theſe Deſigns, being unwilling, that in
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:65650:130"/>
caſe he could not be King himſelf, <hi>France</hi> ſhould fall
under the Subjection of <hi>Spain.</hi> In the Year 1590,
<hi>Henry</hi> obtain'd a glorious Victory over the Duke <hi>de
Maine,</hi> who had double the Number, near <hi>Ivry.</hi>
Then he block'd up <hi>Paris,</hi> which was reduc'd to the
greateſt Extremity by Famine, but reliev'd by the
Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> Governour of the <hi>Netherlands.</hi> In
the Year 1591, there aroſe a third Faction, the young
Cardinal of <hi>Bourbon</hi> making Pretenſions to the Crown,
but was very fortunately diſappointed in his Aim by
the King.<note place="margin">The Pope Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicates <hi>Henry.</hi>
                  </note> Then Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> XIV. excommunicated
<hi>Henry,</hi> exhorting all his Subjects to withdraw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
from their Obedience, which Difficulty <hi>Henry</hi>
did not ſurmount without great troubles. The <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
alſo declar'd themſelves more freely, <hi>Philip</hi> offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his Daughter <hi>Iſabella Clara Eugenia</hi> to be made

by the young Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> he being then
juſt eſcap'd out of his Cuſtody, as 'tis ſuppos'd, by
connivance of the King, who ſuppoſed, that thereby
that Party might be divided, ſince he would certainly
endeavour to oppoſe the Deſigns of the Duke <hi>de
Maine</hi> his Uncle.<note place="margin">Propoſals a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſetting up another King.</note> After the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> had rais'd
the Siege of <hi>Roan,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> urg'd more and more,
that the <hi>French</hi> would take a Reſolution concerning
the ſetting up of another King. And in the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
of the Eſtates in <hi>Paris,</hi> which was held for that
purpoſe,<note place="margin">1593.</note> it was propos'd, That <hi>Iſabella</hi> the Daughter
of <hi>Philip,</hi> being born of a <hi>French</hi> Mother, ſhould be
declar'd Queen of <hi>France,</hi> and that ſhe ſhould have
for her Husband <hi>Erneſt</hi> Arch-Duke of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> But
the <hi>French</hi> refuſing to accept of a Foreigner for their
King, <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> was propoſed as a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
to <hi>Iſabella.</hi> This Propoſition reliſh'd very ill
with the Duke of <hi>Maine,</hi> who thought himſelf ſo
well deſerving, that no body ought to be preferr'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him; wherefore, if he could not have the Crown,
he was reſolv'd no body elſe ſhould have it, and ſo
employ'd all his Cunning, that there was nothing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
in the Aſſembly concerning this Propoſition;
the King, however, plainly perceiv'd, That if he did
not change his Religion, his Affairs muſt needs grow
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:65650:130"/>
worſe, eſpecially, ſince theſe Catholicks, who hitherto
had been of his Party did threaten to leave him, if
he did not perform his Promiſe. He called therefore
the Biſhops together,<note place="margin">The King chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> who inſtructed him in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Faith, and having receiv'd Abſolution, he
went,<note place="margin">1593.</note> to St. <hi>Denys</hi>'s Chapel to Maſs. And that the
People might taſt the ſweetneſs of Peace, and deſire
it, he made a Truce of three Months, which prov'd
very ſucceſsfull, eſpecially, ſince the fundamental Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
namely, <hi>Henry</hi>'s being a Heretick, was now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd.
<hi>Vitry</hi> and the City of <hi>Meaux</hi> were the firſt
that ſurrender'd themſelves to the King in the ſame
Year,<note place="margin">Several Cities ſurrender to him.</note> upon very advantageous Conditions; <hi>Aix, Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Orleans, Bourges</hi> and other Cities ſoon followed
their Example. And to encourage the reſt to do the
ſame, the King cauſed himſelf to be Crowned and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed
in <hi>Chartres, Rheims</hi> being as yet in the hands
of the League. Not long after <hi>Paris</hi> was alſo Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
by the Governour <hi>Briſſac;</hi> and here the King was
received with ſuch joyfull Acclamations of the People,
as if they had never been his Enemies, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
being turn'd out with Ignominy, and the hiſſing
of the Common people. Then all the reſt of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Governours ſurrendred themſelves to the King
on very advantageous Conditions, which the King was
willing to grant them, that he might once be put in
quiet poſſeſſion of the Crown, and drive the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
out of <hi>France.</hi> The young Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> ſubmitted
himſelf, being made Governour of <hi>Provence.</hi> Then
<hi>Henry</hi> denounced War againſt <hi>Spain,</hi> not only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
himſelf for what Troubles they had created to
him before, but alſo to pleaſe the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> and to
root out of the People their affection for the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
Theſe were the Fruits <hi>Philip</hi> reapt for ſo many Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which he had beſtowed in ſupporting the League.
In the beginning of the ſame Year,<note place="margin">1594.</note> a Knife was by a
certain deſperate Ruffian,<note place="margin">The King aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted and wounded by a Ruffian.</note> called <hi>John Caſtel,</hi> thruſt
into the King's Mouth, whereby he loſt one of his
Teeth. It was the King's good fortune that he juſt
bowed himſelf, this Villain's aim having been at his
Throat:<note place="margin">The Jeſuits baniſh'd,</note> And becauſe it was found out, that the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits
had been tampering with him, whoſe Principles
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:65650:131"/>
alſo were thought very dangerous, they were baniſh'd
out of <hi>France,</hi> but ſome years after reſtored again.
Afterwards the Duke of <hi>Nevers</hi> being ſent to <hi>Rome</hi>
to obtain Abſolution for King <hi>Henry,</hi> the ſame was
granted by the Pope, who had been very averſe hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
to <hi>Henry;</hi> but perceiving that he would main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
his Crown in ſpite of him, was now for ingratia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
himſelf with the King. Then the Dukes of <hi>Maine,</hi>
and <hi>Eſpernon,</hi> and <hi>Marſeilles</hi> were received again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the King's favour. But the War againſt <hi>Spain</hi> did
not ſucceed according to wiſh. For tho' the King had
got ſome advantages over them in the <hi>Franche Comte,</hi>
and had beat the <hi>Spaniards</hi> out of <hi>Han</hi> in <hi>Picardy;</hi> yet
on the other ſide, theſe took <hi>Dourlans</hi> and <hi>Cambray,</hi>
the latter of which had been hitherto in the Poſſeſſion of
<hi>Balagny</hi> under <hi>French</hi> protection; and in the Year 1596,
next following, they took <hi>Calais</hi> and <hi>Ardres.</hi> And tho'
the King took from the <hi>Spaniards Fere,</hi> yet was that
a very ſlender compenſation of his Loſſes. But there
happened another great Misfortune; For the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
in the Year next following took the City of <hi>Amiens</hi> by
ſurprize, which was not re-taken without great pains.
In the Year 1598, the Duke of <hi>Mercoeur,</hi> who hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
had ſtood out reſolutely in <hi>Bretany,</hi> did at laſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
himſelf, hoping thereby to obtain the ſaid Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
And to ſet the <hi>Huguenots</hi> at reſt, he publiſh'd
for their ſecurity that famous Edict of <hi>Nants,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Edict at <hi>Nants.</hi>
                  </note> as it is
called, by virtue of which they have hitherto enjoyed
the free Exerciſe of Religion. At laſt a Peace was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
betwixt <hi>Henry</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> at <hi>Vervins,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Peace of <hi>Vervins.</hi>
                  </note>
with Conditions, that ſuch Places as were taken ſince
the Year 1559, ſhould be reſtored on both ſides. A
Peace being thus concluded, and <hi>Henry</hi> reſolved to be
even with the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who under his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour's
Reign had taken <hi>Saluzze,</hi> and during the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine
Wars had raiſed great Troubles in <hi>Dauphine</hi> and
<hi>Provence,</hi> in hopes to ſnatch away a piece of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
Kingdom; and tho' the Duke came in
Perſon into <hi>France,</hi> and promiſed to the King to give
him ſome other Places in exchange of the former; yet
was he not in earneſt, in hopes to be upheld by <hi>Spain,</hi>
or that the Marſhal <hi>de Biron,</hi> with whom he kept pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:65650:131"/>
Intelligence, ſhould renew the civil Commotions.
But the King fell upon him,<note place="margin">He takes from the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> all that he poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed on this ſide the <hi>Alpes.</hi>
                  </note> and took from the Duke
all what he was poſſeſs'd of on this ſide of the <hi>Alpes.</hi>
At laſt, by Mediation of the Pope, an agreement was
made, that the Duke ſhould give to <hi>France,</hi> in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
for <hi>Saluzze, La Breſſe, Bugey, Valromay en Gex.</hi>
The <hi>Italian</hi> Princes were very ill ſatisfied with this
Peace,<note place="margin">1600.</note> ſince there being no door left for <hi>France</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Italy, Italy</hi> was left to the diſcretion of the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard.</hi>
But <hi>Henry</hi> being tired with ſo long and tedious
War, was reſolved at laſt to enjoy the ſweet Fruits of
Peace after ſo many years Troubles. But ſoon after a
dangerous Conſpiracy was diſcovered,<note place="margin">The Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal <hi>de Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron.</hi>
                  </note> contrived by the
Mareſchal <hi>de Biron,</hi> who intended with the Aſſiſtance
of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to depoſe the King, and to diſmember
the Kingdom, by ſetting up a great many petty Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities;
having agreed with the reſt, to have for his
ſhare the Dukedom of <hi>Burgundy.</hi> And he refuſing to
accept of the King's Mercy, which he was willing to
grant him in conſideration of his great Deſerts, was
condemn'd,<note place="margin">1602.</note> and his Head cut off. The King being
now at Peace, did employ all his Thoughts, how <hi>France</hi>
might recover it ſelf after ſuch tedious Wars, and that
good Ordinances might be eſtabliſh'd, but eſpecially
that his Revenues might be encreaſed. He eſtabliſh'd
for this purpoſe all ſorts of Manufactories,<note place="margin">He introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturies.</note> and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
that of Silk, (which afterwards drew great Riches
into that Kingdom.) But even in the midſt of Peace
he was continually troubled with his Queen, who was
jealous about his Miſtriſſes; and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
plotting both againſt his Perſon and Crown. On
the other hand, <hi>Henry</hi> had a deſign to oppoſe the grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Power of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His Deſign to put a ſtop to the growth of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria.</hi>
                  </note> by keeping it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Bounds of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Hereditary Countries
in <hi>Germany.</hi> And 'tis ſaid, that for that purpoſe he
concerted Meaſures with the <hi>Northern</hi> Crown, with
<hi>Holland,</hi> with the Proteſtant Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> with
the Elector of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> the <hi>Swiſs,</hi>
and even the Pope himſelf. To put this deſign in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
he took the opportunity of thoſe Differences
which were then on foot concerning the Succeſſion in
the Country of <hi>Juliers,</hi> which, that it might not be
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:65650:132"/>
devoured by the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> he was reſolved to
prevent with all his Might. This is certain, that his
Preparations were greater, than ſeem'd to be requiſite
only for the buſineſs of <hi>Juliers;</hi> for he and his Allies
had got 120000 Men together, and prodigious Summs
of Money. The Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> on the other hand
did not make the leaſt Preparations, juſt as if it had
fore-known the fatal Blow, which happened ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
The Army was marching towards the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,</hi>
and the King ready to follow in a few days, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
cauſed the Queen to be Crowned, and conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
her Regent during his abſence; When the King
going along the Street in <hi>Paris</hi> in his Coach, which
was fain to ſtop by reaſon of the great Croud of the
People,<note place="margin">He is Aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated by <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villac.</hi>
                  </note> was by a deſperate Ruffian, whoſe Name was
<hi>Francis Ravillac,</hi> ſtabb'd with a Knife in his Belly,
ſo that he without uttering one word died immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately.<note place="margin">May 14. 1610.</note>
There are ſome, who make no-queſtion of it,
but that this Villain was ſet on to commit this fact,
and that it was not done without the knowledge of
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and the Queen her ſelf. And ſo fell this
great Hero by the hands of a profligate Wretch, after
he had ſurmounted great Difficulties in aſcending the
Throne, and had avoided above fifty ſeveral Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies;
which being moſt contrived by the Prieſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
his Life, were all timely diſcovered. His Death
proved very pernicious to the Kingdom, becauſe, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Minority of his Son, the Power of the Great
Men, and alſo of the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> did extreamly encreaſe.</p>
               <p>§. 23. His Son <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. ſucceeded him,<note place="margin">Lewis XIII.</note> being
ſcarce nine Years of Age, and under the Tuition of his
Mother <hi>Mary de Medicis,</hi> ſhe endeavour'd to preſerve
Peace abroad by Alliance, and at home by Clemency
and Liberality towards the great Men of the Kingdom,
who nevertheleſs ſeveral times raiſed Diſturbances,
whereby they made their own advantage, the Queen-Regent
being not Powerfull enough to keep them in
Obedience by force. As ſoon as the King had taken
upon himſelf the Management of Affairs,<note place="margin">1617.</note> he cauſed
<hi>Concini,</hi> Marſhal <hi>d' Ancre,</hi> who was born a <hi>Florentine,</hi>
to be killed, he having been in great Power during the
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:65650:132"/>
Queen's Regency, and by his Pride, Riches and Power,
drawn upon himſelf the Hatred of the Subjects; by his
Death he hoped to appeaſe the diſſatisfied Multitude.
The Queen-Mother was ſent away from Court to <hi>Blois,</hi>
from whence ſhe was carried away by the Duke <hi>d' Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernon.</hi>
And theſe Commotions were at laſt appeaſed
by beſtowing liberal Preſents among the Great Men.<note place="margin">1619.</note>
About the ſame time <hi>Richlieu,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Richlieu</hi> comes in play.</note> afterwards made a
Cardinal, began to be in great Eſteem in Court, who
adviſed the King to eſtabliſh his Authority, and to
take up by the Roots the inteſtine Evils of <hi>France.</hi>
He laid this down as a fundamental Principle, That he
ſhould take from the <hi>Huguenots</hi> the power of doing him
any miſchief, conſidering that ſuch as were diſſatisfied
at any time, or that were of a turbulent Spirit, took
always refuge, and were aſſiſted by them. The firſt
beginning was made in the King's Patrimonial Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
of <hi>Bearn,</hi> where he cauſed the Catholick Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
to be re-eſtabliſh'd. The <hi>Huguenots</hi> being great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſſatisfied thereat, began to break out into Violence,
whence the King took an opportunity to recover ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Places from them, but ſuſtained a conſiderable Loſs
in the Siege of <hi>Montauban,</hi> till at laſt Peace was made
with the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> under condition that they ſhould
demoliſh all their new Fortifications, except thoſe of
<hi>Montauban</hi> and <hi>Rochelle.</hi> In the Year 1625, Cardinal
<hi>Richlieu</hi> was made Chief Miniſter of <hi>France,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Made chief Miniſter of State.</note> about
which time alſo the ſecond War with the <hi>Huguenots</hi>
was ended. But this Peace did not laſt long, becauſe
thoſe of <hi>Rochelle</hi> would not bear, that the Fortreſs called
<hi>Fort-Lewis,</hi> ſhould be built juſt under their Noſes.
<hi>Richlieu</hi> therefore having taken a reſolution at once
to put an end to this War by the taking of <hi>Rochell,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieg'd
it ſo cloſe both by Sea and Land, that the <hi>Engliſh,</hi>
who had had very ill Succeſs in the Iſle of <hi>Rhée,</hi>
where they Landed, could bring no Succours into the
place.<note place="margin">Rochelle <hi>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</hi>
                  </note> Their Obſtinacy was at laſt over-come by Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
of 18000 Citizens, there having been not above
5000 left, for they had lived without Bread for thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Weeks. With this ſtroke the Strength of the
<hi>Huguenots</hi> was broken, <hi>Montauban</hi> upon the perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the Cardinal having demoliſhed its Works.
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:65650:133"/>
The cunning Duke of <hi>Roan</hi> alſo at laſt made his peace,
after he had been ſufficiently troubleſome to the King
in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> under condition, that the Cities of
<hi>Niſmes</hi> and <hi>Montpelier</hi> ſhould demoliſh their Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations;
but for the reſt, enjoy the free Exerciſe of
their Religion. And thus the Ulcer, which had ſettled
it ſelf in the very Entrails of <hi>France,</hi> was happily heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up.<note place="margin">The Effects of the Civil Wars.</note> It is related by ſome, that theſe Civil Wars

Condition, and the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> began to hold
up its Head again, <hi>France</hi> broke out into open War
with <hi>Spain,</hi> to balance the growing Power of the
Houſe of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> He took for a pretence that the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> had ſurprized the City of <hi>Treves,</hi> and taken
the Elector of <hi>Treves</hi> Priſoner, who was under <hi>French</hi>
protection. And then the War began in <hi>Italy, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>
the <hi>Netherlands</hi> and <hi>Rouſſilion,</hi> which was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
on with various Fortune; yet ſo, that the <hi>French</hi>
got the better of it at laſt. To touch upon ſome of
the moſt remarkable Actions: The firſt Attack which
the <hi>French</hi> made in the <hi>Netherlands</hi> did not ſucceed
very well, they having been forced to raiſe the Siege
of <hi>Lovain</hi> with great Loſs.<note place="margin">1636.</note> In the Year 1636, <hi>Picco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomini</hi>
marched into <hi>Picardy,</hi> and <hi>Galias</hi> into <hi>Burgundy,</hi>
but did nothing of moment. On the other hand the
<hi>French</hi> beat up the Siege of <hi>Leucate</hi> in <hi>Rouſſilion,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1638.</note> and
the brave Duke <hi>Barnhard</hi> of <hi>Saxen-Weimar</hi> took the
Fortreſs of <hi>Briſac,</hi> he carrying on the War with
<hi>French</hi> Money. And after the Death of this Duke,
which happened not long after, the King of <hi>France</hi>
brought both that Fortreſs and his Army over to its
ſide with Money. Yet the <hi>French</hi> miſcarried in the
ſame Year before St. <hi>Omer</hi> and <hi>Fontarabia,</hi> before the
laſt of which Places the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> ſuſtained a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
Loſs. In the ſame Year, <hi>viz.</hi> on the 5th. of
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:65650:134"/>
                  <hi>September, Lewis</hi> XIV. was, almoſt by a Miracle, born
of a Marriage, which had proved unfruitfull for twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Years before. In the Year 1639, the <hi>French</hi> were
beaten before <hi>Thionville.</hi> In the Year 1640, they took
<hi>Arras,</hi> and in the ſame Year <hi>Catalonia,</hi> revolting from
<hi>Spain,</hi> threw it ſelf under the <hi>French</hi> Protection. In
the Year 1641, a great Misfortune hung over <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu</hi>'s
Head, the Count the <hi>Soiſſons</hi> having raiſed a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Rebellion; but, he being killed in an Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
wherein otherwiſe his Party had the better, eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd,
by his Death, the Cardinal's Authority, and
the Quiet of <hi>France.</hi> In the Year 1642, <hi>Perpignan</hi>
was taken, at which Siege the King and <hi>Richlieu</hi> were
both preſent. Monſieur <hi>Cinqmats</hi> did about that time
firſt inſinuate himſelf into the King's favour, hoping
thereby to undermine <hi>Richlieu.</hi> And the better to
balance the Cardinal, he had made ſome under-hand
Intrigues with <hi>Spain.</hi> But the Cardinal having diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
the buſineſs, cauſed his Head to be cut off; as
alſo <hi>de Thou</hi> the younger's, becauſe he had been privy
to the buſineſs; tho' he had adviſed againſt it, yet had
he not diſcover'd it. From the Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> who
had been alſo of the Cabal, he took for a Puniſhment
his ſtrong Hold, <hi>Sedan.</hi> In the ſame Year <hi>Richlieu</hi> died,
to his great good fortune, the King being grown quite
weary of him, notwithſtanding he had laid the firſt
Foundation of the Greatneſs of <hi>France,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">May 14. 1643.</note> which is now
ſo formidable to <hi>Europe.</hi> The King alſo died not long

he came to the Crown, his Mother 'tis true bore the
name of <hi>Regent</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> but in effect the Cardinal
<hi>Julius Mazarini</hi> had the chief Management of the
Kingdom;<note place="margin">Mazarini'<hi>s Miniſtry.</hi>
                  </note> which was then in a very flouriſhing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;
but every Body was for enriching himſelf out
of the Kings Purſe during his Minority; and <hi>Mazarini</hi>
was very liberal, thereby endeavouring to make them
in love with his Government. But the Treaſury be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
become empty, new Taxes were of neceſſity to
be impoſed upon the People which cauſed a great
diſſatisfaction againſt the Government. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:65650:134"/>
for the firſt Five years every thing was pretty quiet
at home, and War carried on abroad. At the very
firſt beginning of this new Government the Duke
<hi>d' Auſtria</hi> obtained a ſignal Victory againſt the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
near <hi>Rocroy;</hi> after which he took <hi>Thionville,</hi>

                  <hi>Anguin</hi>
revenged the loſs which the <hi>French</hi> had ſuſtainded the

the <hi>Bavarian</hi> Forces near <hi>Friburg</hi> in <hi>Briſgaw,</hi> he
took <hi>Philipsburg;</hi> in the Year 1646. he beat the <hi>Bava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi>
Troops near <hi>Norlingen,</hi> and afterwards took <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirk.</hi>
But in the Year next following he in vain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged
the City of <hi>Lorida.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Peace of <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</hi>
                  </note> In the Year 1648. a Peace
was concluded at <hi>Munſter</hi> in <hi>Weſtphalia,</hi> betwixt the
Emperour and <hi>France,</hi> by Vertue of which the latter
got the two Fortreſſes of <hi>Briſac</hi> and <hi>Philipsburg,</hi>
the Countrey of <hi>Puntgau,</hi> and part of the upper <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatia.</hi>
But as <hi>France</hi> by this Peace was freed from
one Enemy,<note place="margin">The inteſtine Commotions.</note> ſo on the other hand the inteſtine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions
put a ſtop to its great Progreſſes. The chief
reaſon of theſe Troubles was, that ſome envying <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarini,</hi>
as being a Foreigner, they would by all means
have him removed from the Helm, and this they ſought
with the greater Importunity, becauſe they were not
in awe of the King, who was but a Child, neither of
his Mother, ſhe being an outlandiſh Woman. Some
of the great Men alſo were for fiſhing in troubled Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:
But above all the reſt, the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>
would fain have been Maſter, and have made the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
dance after his Pipe. The Cardinal was for
bringing of him over to his Party by a Marriage pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to him; but the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> perceiving that
the Cardinal was for maintaining his old Poſt, nor
would depend on him, rejected the Offer as unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
the Grandeur of his Houſe. There were alſo
ſome Women of a reſtleſs Spirit concern'd in theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues,
among whom was Mad. <hi>de Longueville,</hi> Siſter
of the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> Mad. <hi>Chevreuſe, Mombazon,</hi>
and others. The firſt beginning was by ſlanderous
Papers and Libels which were daily diſpers'd in <hi>Paris.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1648.</note>
There was alſo a certain Faction ſet up,<note place="margin">The Slingers.</note> who called
themſelves <hi>the Slingers,</hi> becauſe they openly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:65650:135"/>
to knock down the Cardinal, as <hi>David</hi> ſtruck
down the Giant <hi>Goliah</hi> by the help of his Sling.
The Heads of this Faction were the Duke of <hi>Beaufort,</hi>
and <hi>Guadi</hi> the Archbiſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> afterwards call'd
the Cardinal <hi>de Rez.</hi> With this Party alſo ſided the
Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> which did pretend to have a
great Authority againſt the Government at that time.
The firſt Inſurrection was made in <hi>Paris,</hi> occaſion'd
by the taking into Cuſtody of one <hi>Brauſſel</hi> a Member
of the Parliament, whereupon the King left the City.
Yet the Buſineſs was compos'd for that time, ſome
things having been granted to the mutinous Party.
But the Faction of the Slingers renewing their former
Diſturbances,<note place="margin">The King forc'd to leave <hi>Paris,</hi> 1649.</note> the King left the City a ſecond time.
The Parliament having then publickly condemn'd the
Cardinal, grew every day ſtronger, <hi>Turenne,</hi> who then
commanded the <hi>French</hi> Army in <hi>Germany,</hi> having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
for that ſide; but he was fain to leave the Army,
which was kept in Duty by the help of a good Summ
of Money. And tho' Matters were afterwards recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil'd
a ſecond time at St. <hi>Germains,</hi> yet the Deſign a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>Mazarin</hi> was not laid aſide; the Prince of
<hi>Conde,</hi> who had brought over the Slingers to his Party,
not ceaſing to ſtir them up againſt him. But becauſe
they had a different Aim, for the Slingers were for to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
pulling down of the Cardinal, but the Prince of
<hi>Conde</hi> would only have humbled him, the Cardinal
cunningly rais'd a miſunderſtanding betwixt them,
by ſetting the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> againſt the Slingers.
Whereupon the Slingers were reconcil'd with the
Cardinal. The Cardinal taking hold of this Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,
cauſed the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> and his Brother the
Prince of <hi>Conti,</hi> and their Brother-in-law the Duke
of <hi>Longueville</hi> to be taken into Cuſtody.<note place="margin">The Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Princes.</note> This was
putting Fuel into the Fire, every body being diſſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd
at the Impriſonment of the Princes. The City
of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> openly rebell'd. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> upon
this Occaſion took from the <hi>French, Piombino</hi> and <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Longone</hi> in <hi>Italy.</hi> The Archduke <hi>Leopold</hi> ſtruck
Terrour into the City of <hi>Paris</hi> it ſelf, on the ſide of
the <hi>Netherlands.</hi> And tho' the Cardinal beat <hi>Turenne</hi>
near <hi>Rethel,</hi> he being gone over to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> yet
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:65650:135"/>
the Hatred againſt him encreas'd daily, and the Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Slingers, the Parliament, and the Duke of
<hi>Orleans</hi> were abſolutely for having the Princes ſet at
Liberty. The Cardinal therefore perceiving that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
was to be done by open Violence, reſolv'd to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
the Storm, by ſetting the Princes at Liberty:
And he himſelf retir'd to <hi>Bruel,</hi> the Court of the
then Elector of <hi>Collen.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1651.</note> Then he was by a Decree of
the Parliament for ever baniſh'd the Kingdom of
<hi>France.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Cardinal baniſh'd <hi>France.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Mazarini</hi> being thus remov'd, the Prince of
<hi>Conde</hi> began to diſturb the publick Quiet with more
freedom, having engag'd himſelf with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi>
and being gone to <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> he began to make open
War againſt the Government. And the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
taking hold of this Opportunity, recover'd <hi>Barcello<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
and with it all <hi>Catalonia.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Queen re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calls him.</note> Then the Queen re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call'd
the Cardinal, who having ſtrengthen'd the King's
Army by ſuch Troops as he had got together, fought
ſeveral times very briskly with the Prince of <hi>Conde.</hi>
But ſeeing that the Hatred which the Faction of the
Slingers and the Parliament had conceiv'd againſt
him, did not diminiſh, he took this Courſe, that he
publickly declar'd, he was willing to leave the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
to re-eſtabliſh the publick Quiet. He hoped
by ſo doing, to lay the Blame of the Inteſtine Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
upon the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> alone; which Deſign
prov'd ſucceſsfull; for thereby the Eyes of the People
were opened, who now plainly perceiv'd, that the
Cardinal ſought the Good of the King and Kingdom,
but the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> his own Intereſt, <hi>Dunkirk</hi>
and <hi>Graveling</hi> being loſt in the Fray. The Prince of
<hi>Conde</hi> therefore perceiving that he had loſt the Favour
of the People, retir'd with his Troops into the <hi>Spaniſh
Netherlands.</hi> Then the Cardinal return'd to Court,
and ever after had the Adminiſtration of the chiefeſt
Affairs of the Kingdom till his Death, without any
further Oppoſition. The City of <hi>Paris</hi> return'd to
its due Obedience, the Faction of the Slingers was
diſſolv'd, the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> left the Court; <hi>Rez</hi>
was taken into Cuſtody, and <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> forc'd to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.
In the Year next following the <hi>French</hi> began a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain

                  <note place="margin">1653.</note> they took <hi>Mom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy</hi>

to oppoſe their March; for they trick'd him, and
having march'd to the <hi>lower Rhine,</hi> in conjunction with
the <hi>Spaniard</hi> and Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> took <hi>Bon:</hi> This,
and the loſs of <hi>Narden,</hi> which the <hi>Dutch</hi> took, caus'd

For it ſeem'd very difficult to maintain ſo many
Garriſons, and at the ſame time to have a ſufficient
Army in the Field to oppoſe the Enemy; ſince it
might eaſily have happen'd, that all Correſpondency
with theſe places in the United Provinces might have
been cut off by the Enemy. Afterwards <hi>Spain</hi> and
the whole <hi>German</hi> Empire declar'd againſt <hi>France,</hi>
and a great many were of Opinion, That the joint
Power of <hi>Spain, Holland</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> would be
ſufficient to curb the <hi>French,</hi> and to carry the Seat of
the War into <hi>France</hi> it ſelf; but this could not be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.

<hi>French, Philipsburgh,</hi> and beat them out of <hi>Treves,</hi>

we have briefly related, it muſt be obſerv'd, That
it is ſwarming (if I may ſo ſpeak) with People, and
ſow'd thick with Cities and Towns. Under the Reign
of <hi>Charles</hi> IX. it is related, That above twenty Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of People paid the Poll Tax. Some ſay, That
<hi>Richlieu</hi> affirm'd, that by Computation, <hi>France</hi> could
bring into the Field 600000 Foot, and 150000 Horſe,
provided every Man that was able to bear Arms, did
go into the Field. This Nation alſo has been always
warlike: nevertheleſs in former times, it has been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
to them, That they were very brave at the firſt
Onſet, but after their firſt Fury was a little cool'd, their
Courage us'd to ſlacken, if they met with a ſtout and
brave Reſiſtance: wherefore they us'd to make great
Conqueſts, but ſeldom kept them very long. And
after they had good Succeſs, they us'd to grow care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
inſult over the conquer'd, and put them to great
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:65650:138"/>
Hardſhips under their Government. But in our laſt
Wars they have ſhewn ſufficiently, that they as little
want Conſtancy at laſt, as Heat and Fury at firſt.
There is a great number of Nobles in <hi>France,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Full of Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</note> who
make Profeſſion of the Sword, and make no difficulty
to expoſe themſelves to any Hazards to gain Glory.
In former times, the <hi>French</hi> Infantry was good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
wherefore they always us'd to employ <hi>Swiſs</hi>
and <hi>Scotch:</hi> but now a-days, their Foot are very good,
and in attacking of a place, they are to be preferr'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all other Nations. This Nation always hath a great
Veneration and Love for their King; and as long as he
is able to maintain his Authority, is ready to ſacrifice
Life and Eſtate for his Glory. The <hi>French</hi> are alſo
brisk, forward, and of a merry Conſtitution: as to
their outward appearance in their Apparel and Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
they are generally very comely;<note place="margin">Their Natural Qualities.</note> and ſome other
Nations, whoſe temper is more inclined to gravity, and
do attempt to imitate them, appear often very ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
there being a vaſt difference in theſe matters, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
what is natural and what is affected. They are
of a Genius fit to undertake any thing, whether it be
in Learning, Trade, or Manufactures; eſpecially in
thoſe things which depend more on ingenuity and dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity
than hard labour. On the other ſide, the levity
and inconſtancy of the <hi>French</hi> is generally blam'd,
which is eaſily to be perceiv'd by ſuch of them as are
raw and unpoliſh'd; and a great many of them glory
in amorous Intrigues, oftentimes more than is true;
and under Pretence of Freedom, they commit great
Debaucheries.</p>
               <p>§. 26. The Country which is poſſeſs'd by this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Nation,<note place="margin">The Nature of the Country.</note> is very conveniently ſituated, almoſt in
the very midſt of the Chriſtian World; wherefore this
King may conveniently keep Correſpondence with
them all, and prevent <hi>Europe</hi> from falling into the
hands of any one Prince. On the one ſide, it has the
<hi>Mediterranean,</hi> on the other the Ocean, and on both
ſides a great many pretty good Harbours; and is well
water'd with Rivers; beſides that great Channel with
twelve Sluces, by which the preſent King has joyn'd
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:65650:139"/>
the Rivers of <hi>Garonne</hi> and the <hi>Aude,</hi> and conſequently
the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> with the Ocean; which proves very
beneficial for Trade. It is alſo very near of a circular
Figure, and well compacted, ſo that one Province may
eaſily aſſiſt another.<note place="margin">Its Situation.</note> On the ſide of <hi>Spain,</hi> the <hi>Pyre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naean</hi>
Mountains; and on the <hi>Italian</hi> ſide, the <hi>Alpes</hi>
are like a Bullwark to the Kingdom: but on the ſide
towards <hi>Germany</hi> and the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> it lies ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
open: For out of the <hi>Netherlands, Paris</hi> it ſelf has
often been hard put to it. And this is the reaſon why
the <hi>French</hi> have been ſo eager in getting a good part
of theſe into their Poſſeſſion, in which they have been
ſucceſsfull in the laſt War, and thereby have mightily
ſtrengthen'd their Frontiers: and for the ſame reaſon,
they have made themſelves Maſters of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify
themſelves on the ſide of <hi>Germany;</hi> and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
to become Maſters of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> the ancient
boundary of <hi>Gaul,</hi> which ſeems the only thing want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Perfection of <hi>France.</hi> Next to this, <hi>France</hi>
may be one of the moſt happy and moſt fruitfull
Countries,<note place="margin">Its Fertility.</note> not only for the equal Temperature of its
Climate betwixt an immoderate Heat and an exceſſive
Cold; but alſo, becauſe it produces every thing, which
ſeems to be requiſite for the Suſtenance and Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
of Mankind; ſo that ſcarce a ſpot of Ground is
to be found in <hi>France,</hi> but what produces ſomething
or other for the benefit of Man. And its Product is
not only ſufficient for its Inhabitants, but alſo plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
enough to be exported into foreign parts. The
Commodities exported out of <hi>France,</hi> are chiefly;
Wine, Brandy, Vinegar, Salt, innumerable ſorts of
Silk, and Woollen Stuffs, and Manufactures, Hemp,
Canvas, Linen, Paper, Glaſs, Saffran, Almonds, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lives,
Capers, Prunello's, Cheſnuts, Soap, and the like.
Yet in <hi>Normandy</hi> and <hi>Picardy,</hi> grow no Vines, but
the common people drink Cyder. Scarce any Metals
are to be found in <hi>France,</hi> and not Gold or Silver
Mines. But this want is ſupplied by the ingenuity of
the <hi>French,</hi> and the folly of Foreigners. For the
<hi>French</hi> Commodities have drawn Fleets of their Money
into <hi>France,</hi> eſpecially ſince <hi>Henry</hi> IV. ſet up the Silk
Manufactury there. There are ſome who have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:65650:139"/>
that <hi>France</hi> ſells Stuffs <hi>A-la-mode</hi> yearly to Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners
only, to the value of 40 millions of <hi>Livres,</hi>
Wine 15 millions, Brandy 5 millions, Salt 10, and ſo
proportionably of other Commodities. Mr. <hi>Forcy</hi> an
<hi>Engliſhman,</hi> ſays, that about the year 1669, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
which were brought from <hi>France</hi> into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
exceeded what were carried from <hi>England</hi> to <hi>France,</hi>
in value 1600000 <hi>lib. Sterl.</hi> And it is notorious that by
help of ſuch Commodities as they ſend into <hi>Spain,</hi> they
get a great part of their <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Plate-Fleet. Yet
Navigation does not flouriſh ſo much in <hi>France</hi> as it
might. The reaſon ſeems to be, that the <hi>French</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is not ſo much addicted to the Sea, and that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Nations have been before-hand with them in the
<hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi> Which is the reaſon, that the
King, tho' he has above 100 Capital Ships, yet cannot
ſet out ſo great a Fleet hitherto, as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and
<hi>Dutch,</hi> as ſome think, wanting able Seamen. For it
is not ſufficient to Man out a Fleet once, but in time
of War, Recruits muſt alſo be had. Nevertheleſs it
may be this King will firſt ſettle his Maritime Affairs,
and afterwards take his opportunity to ſurprize his
Neighbours.<note place="margin">Its Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> 
                  <hi>France</hi> has very few Plantations abroad,
except what is in the <hi>Caribby Iſlands,</hi> the Iſles called
<hi>Tartuges,</hi> and on the North-ſide of <hi>Hiſpaniola.</hi> They
apply themſelves alſo to fiſhing upon the great Sand
Bank before <hi>Newfoundland,</hi> and catch in <hi>Canada</hi> and
<hi>New France</hi> good ſtore of Bevers. They have ſet ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Projects on foot for the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade, but
without any great ſucceſs hitherto, the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who
are ſo powerfull there, oppoſing them with all their
might. Laſtly the great ſtrength of <hi>France</hi> may be
judged of by this, that the Revenue of the Clergy,
which is poſſeſs'd of two fifth parts, as 'tis ſaid, of the
Kingdom, amounts to 104 millions and 500000
Crowns yearly. The King's Revenues are computed
to amount now to 150 millions of Livres, whereas in
the laſt Age it did not amount to above 9 or 10 milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
At the time of <hi>Henry</hi> IV. to 16 millions, and in
the year 1639 to 77 millions; which vaſt difference is
in part to be aſcribed to the different value of Money
ſince thoſe times, and the great Taxes which are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:65650:140"/>
upon the Subjects: but without queſtion the
chief reaſon is, that <hi>France</hi> ſince that time has found
out new ways to draw Money out of other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</p>
               <p>§. 27. As to the Form of Government of <hi>France,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>France.</hi>
                  </note>
it is to be obſerv'd, That anciently there were very po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Dukes, Earls and Lords in <hi>France,</hi> who, tho' they
were Vaſſals of the King, yet they us'd to pay no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Obedience to him, than was conſiſtent with their
own Intereſt, except the Kings were in a Condition to
oblige them to it: But all theſe in proceſs of Time
were extinguiſh'd, and their Countries united to the
Crown. Now-a-days the Dukes and Earls in <hi>France</hi>
are nothing elſe but bare Titles annex'd to ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
Eſtate without any Sovereignty or Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And whereas formerly certain Countries uſed to
be aſſign'd to the King's Sons, whereof they bore the
Title, now-a-days only a certain yearly Revenue is
allotted them, with the Title of a certain Dukedom
or County, wherein perhaps they have not a Foot of
Ground. And after the ancient Sovereign Dukedoms
and Earldoms were aboliſh'd, ſome of the great Men
of the Kingdom had taken upon themſelves great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
in the Kingdom, but by the Policy of <hi>Richlieu</hi>
and <hi>Mararini</hi> they were reduc'd to ſuch a Condition,
that they dare not utter a Word againſt the King. The
Aſſembly of the Eſtates (there being three of them,
<hi>viz.</hi> The Clergy, Nobility, and the Citizens, they
making up the third Eſtate) were alſo formerly in
great Veneration, whereby the King's Power was
much limited. But they having not been conven'd
ſince the Year 1614, their Authority is quite ſuppreſs'd.
Thoſe of the Reform'd Religion did prove alſo very
troubleſome to the Kings of <hi>France</hi> as long as they
were in a Condition to take up Arms, but with the
loſs of <hi>Rochelle</hi> they loſt the Power of giving their
Kings any Diſturbance for the future. And tho' the
King hitherto does not force their Conſciences, yet he
draws off a great many from that Party, by hopes of
his Royal Favour and Preferments. Heretofore the
Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> us'd to oppoſe the King's Deſigns,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:65650:140"/>
under pretence, that it had a right, that the King
could not do any thing of great moment without its
conſent; but this King hath taught it only to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle
with Judicial Buſineſs, and ſome other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns,
which the King now and then is pleas'd to leave
to its Deciſion. The <hi>Gallick</hi> Church alſo boaſts of a
particular Prerogative in regard of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi>
ſhe always having diſputed with the Pope ſome part
of his Authority over her; and the King has the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of the Biſhops and Abbots, all which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
much to the Strength and Increaſe of this
Kingdom, if a wiſe and good King ſits upon the
Throne.</p>

                  </note> When we duely weigh the Power of <hi>France</hi>
in compariſon with its Neighbours, it is eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd,
that there is not any State in Chriſtendom
which <hi>France</hi> doth not equal if not exceed in Power:
'Tis true, in former Ages the <hi>Engliſh</hi> reduc'd the <hi>French,</hi>
but at that time they were poſſeſs'd of a great part of
it themſelves; there were then ſeveral Demi-Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Princes; the <hi>French</hi> Infantry was then inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable,
and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bows were terrible to them:
All which is quite otherwiſe now, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forces
are now not to be compar'd with the <hi>French</hi>
neither in Number nor Goodneſs, ſince the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are
unexercis'd, and their Civil Wars have rather been
carried on by Armies rais'd on a ſudden, than well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciplin'd
Troops, and theſe Wars have not a little
weaken'd this Nation. On the other hand, the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
have chiefly apply'd themſelves to Sea Affairs, and
in this the <hi>French</hi> cannot hitherto be compared with
the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> yet <hi>England</hi> can ſcarce reap any great
Advantages from <hi>France</hi> at Sea. For, ſuppoſe they
ſhould beat the <hi>French</hi> Fleet, yet they would ſcarce
venture to make a Deſcent upon <hi>France,</hi> as having
not any footing there; and the <hi>French</hi> Privateers
would certainly do great miſchief to them. But if
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhould once miſcarry at Sea, an that the
<hi>French</hi> ſhould once get footing in <hi>England,</hi> it might
perhaps prove fatal to that Kingdom, ſince the fate
of the War muſt be then decided by the Iſſue of one

the <hi>French</hi> ſcarce being able to defend themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it, and having ſeveral times been oblig'd to
make Peace upon diſadvantageous Conditions: But
beſides, that at that time the <hi>French</hi> Infantry was
good for little, and the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Nation was then at its

their own Ruin. Neither is it likely that <hi>England</hi>
and <hi>Holland</hi> will agree in a War againſt <hi>France,</hi> for
whilſt one of them is engag'd in a War againſt <hi>France,</hi>
it ſeems to be the Intereſt of the other to ſtand Neuter,
and to promote its own Trade and Navigation. It is
alſo not very probable, that the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi>
eſpecially thoſe of the Proteſtant Religion, ſhould be
willing to ſee <hi>France</hi> fall before the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria;</hi>
ſince both their Power and Religion would ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſlippery Ground, if not ſupported by a Foreign
Power. Wherefore it ſeems to be no difficult task to
perſuade ſome of the Proteſtant Princes, at leaſt, to
ſit ſtill. The <hi>Swiſs</hi> alſo are not likely to co-operate
with <hi>Spain</hi> and the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> in the Conqueſt
of <hi>France,</hi> and therefore it would not be ſo difficult
for <hi>France</hi> to defend it ſelf againſt the Houſe of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria</hi>
and all its Confederates. Not to mention here,
that in ſuch a caſe, <hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>Poland</hi> would not leave
<hi>France,</hi> if they were in a Condition to aſſiſt it. But
it is not probable, that <hi>France</hi> ſhould make any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
upon an Alliance with the <hi>Turks,</hi> except in the
greateſt Extremity; for the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Princes have
learn'd by Experience, that where-ever they have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termedled
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:65650:142"/>
with the Chriſtians in their Wars, theſe
commonly have clapt up a Peace, without including
them, or having any regard to their Intereſt. On the
other hand, <hi>France</hi> ſeems not to be ſtrong enough to
overturn all the States of <hi>Europe</hi> by his Conqueſts:
For <hi>France</hi> may be the moſt potent Kingdom in
Chriſtendom, but not the only one; and by extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
its Conqueſts too far it would be weaken'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in:
In the mean time, thoſe leſſer States bordering up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

                  <hi>Philip</hi> II. therefore was not a little to be
blam'd, as being partly himſelf the cauſe of theſe civil
Troubles; for he being born in <hi>Spain,</hi> and educated
after the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Faſhion, did favour only the <hi>Spain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi>
repreſenting in all his Behaviour a perfect haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<hi>Spaniard;</hi> which did mightily alienate the Minds
of the <hi>Netherlanders,</hi> eſpecially after he reſided alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in <hi>Spain,</hi> and did not ſo much as honour the
<hi>Netherlands</hi> with his Preſence; thinking it perhaps
below his Grandeur, that he who was Maſter of ſo great
a Kingdom, and had ſuch great Projects in his Head,
ſhould trouble himſelf much about the Affairs of the
<hi>Netherlanders.</hi> Tho' in all Probability theſe might
have been kept in Obedience by his Preſence; for his
Father, the ſooner to appeaſe a Tumult which was
only riſen in the City of <hi>Ghent,</hi> did venture to take
his journey through <hi>France,</hi> and the Territories of
<hi>Francis,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">William <hi>Prince of</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range.</note> who was but lately reconcil'd to him. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
<hi>William,</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> a crafty, thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pac'd,
and ambitious Man, did not a little foment theſe
Diviſions. For when <hi>Philip</hi> had taken a Reſolution
to go into <hi>Spain,</hi> and to commit the Adminiſtration
of the <hi>Netherlands</hi> to a Governour, this Prince was
contriving how <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> Dutcheſs of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> might
be conſtituted Regent of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and how
he, by marrying her Daughter, might bear the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
ſway in the Government: But he miſcarrying in
both, becauſe <hi>Philip</hi> conſtituted <hi>Margaret</hi> of <hi>Parma,</hi>
natural Daughter of <hi>Charles</hi> V. Regent of the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,</hi>
and refus'd to give his conſent to the Match,
was ſo diſſatisfy'd thereat, that by doing of Miſchief, he
reſolv'd to ſhow his own Strength.<note place="margin">Diſcontents of the Nobility and Clergy.</note> The Earls of <hi>Eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi>
and <hi>Hoorn</hi> were alſo very much diſſatisfy'd, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
a great many others, who being in great eſteem
with the People, were all very jealous of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
A great many alſo of the Nobility were for a Change,
partly out of a hatred to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> partly becauſe
they were naturally of a turbulent Spirit, and were
become poor and over Head and Ears in Debt, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:65650:143"/>
endeavour'd to outvie the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in Splendour
at Court, and thereby ſpent more than their Incomes
would allow of. The Clergy beſides this, was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
diſcontented, becauſe <hi>Philip,</hi> having created ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
new Epiſcopal Sees, would have employ'd the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues
of ſeveral Abbies for the Maintenance of them,
which did not only diſſatisfie ſuch as were in preſent
Poſſeſſion of theſe Abbies, but others alſo, who were in
hopes of them for the future: for the Abbots were choſen
by a free Election of the Monks in each Monaſtery,
but the Biſhops were nominated by the King.<note place="margin">Change of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</note> But all
this could not have furniſh'd ſufficient Fuel for ſo great
a Flame, if Religion had not been joyn'd to them,
which proves moſt efficacious in diſturbing the Minds
of the Common People, and always ſerves for a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Pretence to ſuch as are for alterations in a State.
There were great numbers in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> who
had relinquiſh'd the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Religion, ſome
of them profeſſing the <hi>Augsburgh</hi> Confeſſion, ſome
the Doctrine of the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> others fell into the
Errors of the <hi>Anabaptiſts. Charles</hi> V. had by ſevere
Proclamations and Puniſhments been very hard upon
them, which had ſerv'd for nothing elſe than to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperate
the Minds of the People, and to promote the
new Religion. Wherefore it was the Opinion of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
Queen of <hi>Hungary,</hi> the Siſter of <hi>Charles</hi> V. and
then Regent of the <hi>Netherlands, That they ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be treated more mildly:</hi> But <hi>Philip</hi> had taken
a Reſolution to root out by force this Hereſie, either
out of a Zeal for the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Religion, or
becauſe he hoped thereby to oblige the Pope, whoſe
Favour he ſtood in need of at that time. He renewed
therefore his Father's Proclamation, and that with
more Severity againſt theſe Hereticks; and to put
them in Execution, he was for ſetting up a Court of
Judicature,<note place="margin">Spaniſh <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition.</hi>
                  </note> according to the Model of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition;
the very Name of which was terrible to
every body: And in effect, this Inquiſition is a very
cruel Conſtitution, whereby the Life, Eſtate, and
good Name of every Subject is put into the Hands of
unmercifull Prieſts, whoſe chief Glory is to be Inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
and Rigorous in their proceedings; and who
have a power to take up and puniſh any perſon upon
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:65650:144"/>
Suſpicion only; and tho' a Man is wrongfully accus'd,
he is not to know either his Accuſer or Crime, and tho'
he makes his Innocence appear, yet he ſeldom eſcapes
without ſome puniſhment. The <hi>Netherlanders</hi> were
the more frightned, not only becauſe in this Court,
no Privileges, no Favour of the King, nor Interceſſions,
did avail; but alſo, becauſe they knew the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi>
to be free in their Speech, carrying, as it were,
their Hearts upon their Tongues, and that by way of
Trade they were obliged to be converſant with thoſe
of other Religions. Whereas on the other hand, it
was natural and eaſie for an <hi>Italian</hi> or <hi>Spaniard</hi> to
keep his Thoughts within himſelf. Some are of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
That the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were glad to ſee that the
<hi>Netherlanders</hi> did begin the Fray, hoping thereby to
get an Opportunity to force them to Obedience, and
by ſuppreſſing their Liberty and Privileges to rule
over them at pleaſure. They hoped that this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
might ſerve them one day for a Magazine, from
whence they might conveniently attack <hi>France, Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and the Northern Kingdoms. Yet it is alſo
moſt certain, that ſome foreign Princes did admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
Fuel to nouriſh and augment the Flame; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<hi>Elizabeth</hi> Queen of <hi>England,</hi> whoſe Intention

<hi>Spaniard,</hi> that he might not be at leiſure to think of

               <p>§. 3. Thus the Seeds of Civil Commotions were
ſown in the Minds of the <hi>Netherlanders,</hi> about which
time <hi>Philip</hi> II.<note place="margin">1559.</note> went into <hi>Spain;</hi> having ſo conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

ſecret Inſtructions to the Regent to rule according
to his Advice: But the <hi>Netherlandiſh</hi> Lords quickly
perceiving, that the whole Government was manag'd
according to the Counſels of the Cardinal, did ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
ſhew their Diſcontent in oppoſing themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:65650:144"/>
it; eſpecially when the Cardinal preſs'd hard to
execute the King's Commands concerning the Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment
of the Biſhops, and rooting out of the new
Religion; the <hi>Netherlandiſh</hi> Lords advis'd a Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the ſame, and to deal more gently with the
People. This rais'd a general Hatred againſt the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal,
whereupon the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and the Earls
of <hi>Egmont</hi> and <hi>Hoorn</hi> writ to the King, <hi>That if he
was not remov'd, it would be impoſſible to preſerve the
Peace of the</hi> Netherlands; neither did they reſt ſtis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd
till <hi>Philip</hi> did conſent to their Demands: But
becauſe the Regent was,<note place="margin">1564.</note> after the removal of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal,
ſway'd by the Preſident <hi>Vigilius</hi> and the Earl
of <hi>Barlemont,</hi> who in every reſpect follow'd the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps
of the Cardinal, this Joy did not laſt long, but
the old Diſcontents being renew'd, it was ſaid, <hi>That
the Body of the Cardinal was remov'd from the Council,
but his Spirit remain'd in it.</hi> Thus the Diviſions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd
in the Council of State, nor could the Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
againſt the new Religion be put in Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
becauſe the People began more and more to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
them.<note place="margin">Count <hi>Eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> ſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </note> It was therefore with conſent of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
and Senate agreed upon, to ſend the Earl of <hi>Eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi>
into <hi>Spain,</hi> who was to give an account to the
King, of the whole ſtate of Affairs, and to ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the King could find out another Remedy. The
King receiv'd him very courteouſly as to his perſon,
but would not remit any thing from his Severity as to
Religion. And imagining that the cauſe why this
Evil had taken ſo deep root, was the Mildneſs of the
Regent, he caus'd his Proclamation to be renew'd, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
withall, That the Counſel of <hi>Trent</hi> ſhould
be introduc'd in the <hi>Netherlands.</hi> Beſides theſe Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
a Rumour was ſpread abroad, That <hi>Philip</hi> had
agreed with <hi>Charles</hi> IX. at <hi>Bayonne,</hi> by all Means and
Ways to root out the Hereticks, which was the cauſe
why it was reſolv'd to oppoſe the King's Intentions.
Some of the Nobility made the firſt beginning,<note place="margin">An Aſſociati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</note> who
enter'd into an Aſſociation (which they called <hi>the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promiſe)</hi>
whereby they engag'd themſelves, to oppoſe
the Inquiſition, and to ſtand by one another, if any
one ſhould be moleſted for his Religion; but ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
proteſted, That they had no other Aim by ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:65650:145"/>
but the Glory of God, the Grandeur of the King,
and the Peace of their native Country. This Aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was drawn up by <hi>Philip Marnix</hi> Lord of <hi>Alde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonde,</hi>
and ſubſcrib'd by 400 Perſons of Quality, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
whom the chiefeſt were <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Brederode,
Lewis</hi> Earl of <hi>Naſſau,</hi> Brother of the Prince of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range,</hi>
the Earls of <hi>Culenburgh</hi> and <hi>Bergh.</hi> Theſe
met at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1566.</note> and deliver'd a Petition to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
wherein they deſir'd, That the Proclamations
iſſu'd forth touching Religion might be annull'd.
The Regent anſwer'd them in courteous but general
terms, telling them, <hi>That ſhe would know the King's
Pleaſure in the Matter.</hi> 'Tis ſaid, That the Earl of
<hi>Barlemont,</hi> who ſtood then near the Regent, did tell
her, <hi>That they were no ways to be fear'd, becauſe they
were only</hi> Geuſen <hi>or Beggars;</hi> which has render'd the
Name of the <hi>Geuſen</hi> very famous afterwards, they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
had a Beggars Pouch the Coat of Arms of that
Confederacy. In the mean while abundance of Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets
were ſpread abroad, which did more and more
exaſperate the People. And becauſe <hi>Philip</hi> had given
but a very indifferent Reception to thoſe Deputies,
which were ſent into <hi>Spain,</hi> to pray for a Mitigation
of theſe Proclamations, and had refus'd to comply in
the leaſt with the Sentiments of the People, it came
to an open Inſurrection. So that the new Religion
was not only publickly profeſs'd and taught in a great
concourſe of People, but the Rabble alſo fell to plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
of Churches and pulling down of Images.<note place="margin">Breaking of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

And tho' the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi>
did what they could to appeaſe this Tumult,
yet had the King conceiv'd a ſhrewd Suſpicion as if
they had been in the bottom of it; wherefore they
were conſulting their own ſafety, but could, as yet,
not come to any Reſolution. In the mean time, the
Regent having rais'd ſome Troops, and endeavour'd
either by Fear or fair Words, or any other ways to
reduce the diſſatisfy'd Party to Obedience, ſome of
whom did by Submiſſion and other Services endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to be reconcil'd to the King. And this Deſign
ſucceeded ſo well, that without any great trouble and
the puniſhment of a very few, the Country was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd
to its Tranquility: Nevertheleſs, becauſe it was
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:65650:145"/>
rumour'd abroad, that a great Army was marching
out of <hi>Spain</hi> againſt them, a great many of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants,
and eſpecially of the Handycrafts Trade, did
retire into the neighbouring Countries. The Prince
of <hi>Orange</hi> himſelf diſliking this calm retir'd into <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 4. It was then the Advice of the Regent, that
the King ſhould come in perſon, without any great
Force, into the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and by his Preſence and
Clemency endeavour entirely to heal the ulcerated
Minds of the People. But he follow'd the Advice of
the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Alva.</hi>

And a Court was erected of twelve Judges, from
which no Appeal was to be allow'd, where Judgment
was to be given concerning theſe Matters, this Court
was commonly call'd <hi>The bloody Council.</hi> Before this
Court, the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> and ſome other Lords,
who were fled, were ſummon'd to appear, and upon
non-appearance they were declar'd guilty of High
Treaſon, and their Eſtates Confiſcated. The ſame Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity
was us'd againſt others of leſs note. This caus'd
ſuch a Terror among the Inhabitants, that they left
their Habitations in Troops. He caus'd alſo Citadels
to be built in ſeveral great Cities, among which one
of the chiefeſt was that of <hi>Antwerp.</hi> In the mean
time the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> had brought together conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Forces in <hi>Germany,</hi> ſome of which, under the
Command of <hi>Lewis</hi> his Brother, falling into <hi>Frieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
beat the Count of <hi>Arembergh,</hi> the Governour of
that Province.<note place="margin">The Earls of <hi>Egmont</hi> and <hi>Hoorn</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed.</note> But ſoon after the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
firſt caus'd the Earls of <hi>Egmont</hi> and <hi>Hoorn</hi> to be

after the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> fell with a great Army into
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:65650:146"/>
                  <hi>Brabant,</hi> but was beaten back by the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi>
and his Forces diſpers'd. The Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> puff'd
up with this great Succeſs, did not only cauſe a moſt
magnificent Statue to be erected at <hi>Antw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

alſo form'd a Deſign to conquer the <hi>Netherlands</hi>
with their own Money, he impos'd a Tax upon them,
of the hundredth Penny, to be paid of the whole va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
of all Eſtates; and beſides this, the twentieth Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
to be paid of all Moveables, but the tenth of all
Immoveables, as often as they were ſold. This did
exaſperate the <hi>Netherlanders</hi> to the utmoſt degree.
And whilſt the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> being in great want of
Money, was buſie in ſqueezing out theſe Taxes, and
was upon the point of forcing the Inhabitants of
<hi>Bruſſels,</hi> who refus'd to pay it, News was brought,
That the baniſh'd <hi>Netherlanders,</hi> who were turn'd
Privateers, and had about 24 Ships of indifferent
Strength, had under the Conduct of the Earl of <hi>March</hi>
taken the City of <hi>Briel</hi> in <hi>Holland.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Briel <hi>taken,</hi> April 1. 1571.</note> Then moſt Cities
of <hi>Holland,</hi> out of a Hatred to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and the
tenth Penny, revolted from the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> except
<hi>Amſterdam</hi> and <hi>Schonhoven,</hi> which remain'd for ſome
time under the Obedience of <hi>Spain.</hi> It was a grand
miſtake in the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> that during his Regen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of four Years, he had not ſecur'd the Sea Coaſts.
The revolted Places choſe for their Governour the
Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> ſwearing to him Allegiance as the
King's Stadtholder, as if they had only revolted from
the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> and not the King. A great many
Privateers then join'd from <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> who
within the ſpace of four Months made up a Fleet of
150 Ships, who had their Rendezvouz at <hi>Fluſhing,</hi>
and afterwards did great Miſchiefs to the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
The Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> was not in a condition to reſiſt this
Storm, becauſe the Earl of <hi>Bergh</hi> had not only at the
ſame time taken a great many places in <hi>Gueldres,
Frieſland</hi> and <hi>Over-yſſel,</hi> but alſo <hi>Lewis</hi> Earl of <hi>Naſſaw,</hi>
had with the Aſſiſtance of the <hi>French,</hi> ſurpris'd <hi>Mons:</hi>
Which City the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> endeavour'd to recover
by force of Arms, and the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> who with
an Army newly rais'd in <hi>Germany,</hi> had made prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
havock in <hi>Brabant,</hi> had in vain endeavour'd to
relieve it, was retir'd into <hi>Holland.</hi> Wherefore this
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:65650:146"/>
City was ſurrender'd upon Articles to the Duke of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va.</hi>
He then try'd all ways to reduce the revolted
places to Obedience by force, having among others,
pillag'd <hi>Malines</hi> and <hi>Zutphen,</hi> quite deſtroy'd <hi>Naer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>
and taken <hi>Haerlem</hi> after a tedious Siege, the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants

<hi>Alva</hi> (who us'd to bragg, that during his Regency of

                  </note> but who had a very
ill beginning of his Regency, the Fleet which he had
ſent out to relieve <hi>Middleburgh</hi> being deſtroy'd before
his Eyes, and the City ſurrender'd to the Prince of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range:</hi>
Yet the Prince alſo receiv'd a great Blow; for
his Brother <hi>Lewis,</hi> who led an Army to his Aſſiſtance
out of <hi>Germany,</hi> was routed near <hi>Grave</hi> upon the
<hi>Mockerhyde,</hi> where he and his Brother <hi>Henry</hi> were
ſlain in the Field. After this Victory the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
mutiny'd for want of Pay, and liv'd upon free
Quarters in <hi>Antwerp</hi> till all was paid. Then the Siege
of <hi>Leyden</hi> was undertaken, which was reduc'd to the
utmoſt extremity by Famine, till a Dyke of the
<hi>Maeſe</hi> was cut through, by which means, and the
help of a <hi>North Weſt</hi> Wind at Spring tide, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
round about being put under Water, the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi>
after a great loſs ſuſtain'd, were forc'd to leave it.
In the Year next following the Emperour endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
by his Mediation to compoſe theſe Troubles,<note place="margin">1574.</note>
and a Meeting was held for that purpoſe betwixt the
Deputies of both Parties at <hi>Breda,</hi> which prov'd
fruitleſs. Then the <hi>Spaniards</hi> took <hi>Ziricuzea</hi> after a
Siege of nine Months; but before the place was taken
<hi>Lewis Requeſenes</hi> died.<note place="margin">1576.</note> After his Death the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of State took the Adminiſtration of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
into their Hands, which was approved by the
King.</p>
               <p>§. 6. In the mean time the Hatred of the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi>
againſt the <hi>Spaniards</hi> was more and more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:65650:147"/>
eſpecially after the Souldiers, who were
grown mutinous for want of Pay, and had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
great Outrages, that the Council of State had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
them Enemies, giving leave to the Inhabitants
to take up Arms againſt them. During which Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbances
<hi>Maeſtricht</hi> and <hi>Antwerp</hi> were plunder'd:
Which diſpoſed the reſt,<note place="margin">The Treaty of <hi>Ghent.</hi>
                  </note> to enter upon a Treaty with
the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> at <hi>Ghent,</hi> which contained, That

That the Proclamations iſſued forth during the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency

the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſent out of the Country: Which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,
tho' it was ratify'd by the King, yet he had
taken a Reſolution quickly to diſunite them again.
For this purpoſe he conſtituted <hi>Don John d' Auſtria,</hi>

his natural Brother, Governour of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi>
The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> forewarn'd the <hi>Netherlanders,</hi>
That he ought not to be truſted; notwithſtanding
this, he was receiv'd by plurality of Voices, they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
oblig'd him to ſubſcribe the Contract made at
<hi>Ghent,</hi> and to ſend away the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Souldiers. But
the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> and the Provinces of <hi>Holland</hi>
and <hi>Zealand</hi> were not well ſatisfy'd with this Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the reſt alſo quickly began to miſtruſt him.
He gave them ſufficient occaſion to believe that their
Jealouſie was not ill grounded, when he by Surprize
made himſelf Maſter of the Caſtle of <hi>Namur,</hi> under
pretence to ſecure his perſon againſt any Attempts,
which ſo diſturb'd the <hi>Netherlanders,</hi> that they took
up Arms to drive him out of <hi>Namur,</hi> They alſo
took all the ſtrong Holds, where any <hi>German</hi> Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

for the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> to come to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi>
they conſtituted him Grand Bayliff of <hi>Brabant.</hi>
This encreaſe of the Houſe of <hi>Orange</hi> made ſome

                  <hi>Alexander</hi> Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> came with
an Army out of <hi>Italy</hi> to the Aſſiſtance of <hi>Don John

old <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Troops, beat the Army of the Eſtates
near <hi>Gemblours,</hi> and took <hi>Louvain, Philipville, Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourgh,</hi>
and ſeveral other places. The Eſtates then
finding themſelves alone not ſtrong enough, offer'd
to put themſelves under the Protection of <hi>Henry</hi> III.
King of <hi>France,</hi> and he having refus'd to accept it,
the ſame offer was made to the Duke of <hi>Alenſon</hi> his
Brother, who having accepted of it, came into the
<hi>Netherlands:</hi> But could do nothing of moment, the
Provinces and great Men being ſo divided among
themſelves, that no body knew who was Maſter.
There aroſe alſo a new Diviſion among the Eſtates,
when upon Requeſt of thoſe of the Reformed Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Liberty of Conſcience was allow'd in the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands;</hi>
which was willingly conſented to by thoſe of
<hi>Ghent</hi> and others; but <hi>Artois, Haynault,</hi> and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Wallooon</hi> Cities, that were very zealous for the
Catholick Religion, did oppoſe it with great violence;
and having by degrees ſeparated themſelves from the
reſt, ſet up a new Faction, who were call'd <hi>the Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents.</hi>
During theſe Troubles <hi>Don John d' Auſtria</hi>
died,<note place="margin">Malecontents</note> leaving the Government to the Duke of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi>
who was confirmed in his place by <hi>Philip.</hi>

the Year next following <hi>Groningen</hi> was reduced, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the United Provinces were made entire, and ſecured
on this ſide of the <hi>Rhine.</hi> In the Year 1596, <hi>Albert,</hi>
Arch-Duke of <hi>Auſtria,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Arch-Duke <hi>Albert,</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the <hi>Spaniſh Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands.</hi>
                  </note> arrived as Governour of the
<hi>Netherlands,</hi> who began his Regency with the Taking
of <hi>Hulſt.</hi> And, becauſe <hi>Philip,</hi> being oppreſſed with
Debts, was fain to ſhut up his Exchequer. <hi>Albert,</hi> for
want of Money, was not in a capacity to undertake
any thing of moment in the Year next following, but
was ſoundly beaten near <hi>Tougenhout.</hi> And after the
Trade of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> with <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they uſed to ſend their Ships under Foreign Flags,
had been quite cut off; whereby the <hi>Spaniards</hi> hoped
the ſooner to reduce them to Obedience, Neceſſity, and
the deſire of Lucre, taught them another way to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
vaſt Riches. For by this means the <hi>Hollanders</hi>
were forced to try whether they could Sail themſelves
into the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> and to attempt to find out a
nearer Way thither round about the <hi>North.</hi> But this
Deſign not ſucceding, they took the common Courſe
about <hi>Africa;</hi> and having with incredible Pains, in

ſpite of all the Reſiſtance made by the <hi>Portugueſe,</hi>
ſettled a Trade there, a great many Merchants and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
who knew no better way to employ their Ready<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>money,
erected ſeveral Societies to Trade into the <hi>Eaſt-Indies:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1602.</note>
All which were by virtue of a Patent granted
by the Eſtates,<note place="margin">The <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company.</note> formed into one Company, which did
afterwards prodigiouſly encreaſe its Power in the <hi>Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Indies,</hi>
and has conveyed unconceivable Riches into
<hi>Holland.</hi> In the Year 1597, <hi>Maurice</hi> took <hi>Rhine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergh,
Meurs,</hi> and all the reſt of thoſe Places of
<hi>Over-Yſſel,</hi> which were as yet in the poſſeſſion of
<hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 11. In the Year 1598, they found out another
Decoy for the <hi>Hollanders.</hi> For becauſe it was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
pretended, that they would not live under <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi>
ſubjection, <hi>Philip</hi> found out this artifice: He Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried

That the ſame ſhould return to <hi>Spain,</hi> if no Heirs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
from this Match, which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were very
well aſſured of, the Princeſs being pretty well in Age;
and beſides this, having been ſpoiled before by means of
ſome Medicaments adminiſtred to her to prevent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.
The <hi>Netherlands</hi> being then by this means,
according to outward appearances freed from a Foreign
Subjection, as having got their own Prince, it was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
the <hi>Hollanders</hi> would the eaſier re-unite themſelves
with the other Provinces; becauſe a Peace being lately
concluded betwixt <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> at <hi>Nervin,</hi> the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi>
had thereby loſt their chief Confederate. But
the <hi>Hollanders</hi> remained ſtedfaſt in their former Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
rejecting all Propoſitions of Peace made by the

                  <hi>Maurice</hi> fell into <hi>Flanders,</hi> with an intention to

                  <hi>Albert</hi> then undertook the Siege of

ſaid,<note place="margin">The Conqueſts on both ſides.</note> that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> loſt within the Town above
70000 Men, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> without a great many

the Command of <hi>Frederick Spinola</hi> was deſtroy'd, and
<hi>Rhinebergh, Grave</hi> and <hi>Sluce</hi> taken by <hi>Maurice.</hi> In

Lingen, Groll</hi> and <hi>Rhinebergh,</hi> and <hi>Maurice</hi> ſuſtain'd
ſome loſs before <hi>Antwerp.</hi> The laſt glorious Action in
this War was, that of <hi>James Heemskirke,</hi> who burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet in the Harbour of <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> where
he himſelf was kill'd. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> therefore find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it impoſſible to reduce <hi>Holland</hi> by force, which they
found encreas'd in Strength by the War; and being
beſides this, jealous of <hi>Henry</hi> IV. and quite out of
breath by this tedious War, they reſolv'd to make an
end of it at any rate. How deſirous the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
were of the Peace may eaſily be conjectur'd from hence,
That <hi>Albert</hi> himſelf propos'd the Treaty to be at the
<hi>Hague,</hi> and firſt ſent <hi>Spinola</hi> himſelf thither as Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour,
whereas the <hi>Hollanders</hi> carry'd it very high,
and were very reſolute. The Buſineſs met with great
difficulty, before it could be brought to the concluſion
of a Truce of twelve Years: The greateſt obſtacle was,
that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> urg'd it cloſely, That <hi>Spain</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Exception ſhould declare them a free People,
which the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Embaſſadours refuſing to do, at laſt
this Medium was found out; That <hi>Spain</hi> and the
Archduke <hi>Albert</hi> did declare, they would treat with
the <hi>Netherlanders,</hi> As a free Nation. And they being
not ſatisfy'd alſo with this, the Preſident <hi>Janin,</hi> who was
ſent thither in behalf of <hi>France,</hi> anſwer'd, That the
word <hi>As</hi> could not add much to the Strength of <hi>Spain,</hi>
nor diminiſh theirs; and that it was their Buſineſs to
ſecure themſelves and their State by Arms and not
by Words.<note place="margin">A Truce of 12 Years,</note> Both Parties kept what they were poſſeſs'd
of, and the <hi>Hollanders</hi> maintain'd their Navigation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

have got from them; but the chief cauſe, why the
<hi>Hollanders</hi> at that time when their Affairs were in ſo
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:65650:151"/>
good a Condition, conſented to a Truce, ſeems to be,
that they began to be jealous of <hi>France,</hi> for fear, leſt
that King ſhould ſnatch <hi>Flanders</hi> away upon a ſudden,
which muſt needs have prov'd their Ruin. Beſides this,
<hi>Maurice</hi> being grown very Powerfull during this War,
was likely to be troubleſome to their Liberty. And
this was the firſt ſtep which <hi>Holland</hi> made towards

               </p>
               <p>§. 12. Soon after the Truce was concluded, the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi>

Diviſion in <hi>Holland</hi> betwixt the <hi>Arminians</hi> or <hi>Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants</hi>
(as they are termed) and others; which Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
was partly occaſioned by a State-jealouſie, partly
by Diſputes among the Divines. We have ſaid before,
that Prince <hi>William</hi> did endeavour under-hand to be
Soveraign over the United Provinces, which was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
only by a very few Voices. Then after his Death
his Son <hi>Maurice</hi> purſued the ſame Deſign, but was op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
by the chief Men among them; who alledged,
That their Labour was very ill beſtowed, if in place of
a great One, they ſhould be brought under ſubjection
to a little Prince. Among theſe, one of the chiefeſt was
<hi>John</hi> of <hi>Olden Barneveldt,</hi> Penſionary of <hi>Holland,</hi> who
had been always for upholding the publick Liberty.
But becauſe the Authority of the Captain-General was
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:65650:151"/>
more conſpicuous during the War,<note place="margin">Afterwards manag'd by State Policy.</note> 
                  <hi>Maurice</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured

did, as much as he could, promote the Truce with
<hi>Spain,</hi> knowing that in time of Peace, the Authority of
the Captain-General would be diminiſh'd, which <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice</hi>
kept in good remembrance. In the mean time
<hi>Arminius,</hi> a profeſſour of Divinity in the Univerſity of
<hi>Leyden,</hi> had defended ſeveral Propoſitions concerning
Predeſtination, and ſome other Articles relating to the
ſame, with leſs rigour than the reſt of the Reform'd
Churchs had hitherto generally taught. His Opinion
was after his death oppos'd by one <hi>Francis Gomarus.</hi>
This Diſſenſion being ſpread abroad, moſt of the
Clergy ſided with <hi>Gomarus,</hi> but the chief States-men
with <hi>Arminius.</hi> But becauſe the generality of the
People followed the footſteps of the Clergy, <hi>Maurice,</hi>
who after the Death of his elder Brother, was become
Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> declared himſelf for the <hi>Gomariſts.</hi>
And there happening great Tumults in ſeveral places;
<hi>viz.</hi> at <hi>Alckmaer, Leyden</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> the Prince

Age; <hi>Grotius</hi> was condemned to a perpetual Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment;
out of which he afterwards made his eſcape

And tho' at the Synod of <hi>Dort</hi> the Doctrine of <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>

of the Prince againſt a Man, who had deſerved ſo well,
was very ill reſented by a great many: And theſe two

it is not improbable, but at laſt they may occaſion the

till a bloody War broke out betwixt them and the

                  </note> 18. At laſt, in the Year 1672, a prodigious
Storm fell upon <hi>Holland,</hi> which at firſt threaten'd its
ruin; <hi>France</hi> attacking it by Land, and <hi>England</hi> by
Sea. It was ſurpriſing to ſee how the <hi>French</hi> in a few

that ſome are of Opinion, they might have
taken <hi>Amſterdam</hi> it ſelf, if they had immediately
gone towards it, whilſt the firſt Conſternation laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Some lay the fault upon <hi>Rochford,</hi> who having

tarry'd two days at <hi>

It ſerv'd alſo for a great Encouragement to the
<hi>Hollanders,</hi> that the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter</hi> was forc'd to
go away from before <hi>Groningen,</hi> he having, together
with the Elector of <hi>Collen,</hi> taken the <hi>French</hi> ſide. In
the Year next following the <hi>French</hi> took <hi>Maeſtricht</hi>
from the <hi>Hollanders.</hi> But the <hi>Hollanders</hi> having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hav'd

and the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> being become very jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
of <hi>France,</hi> a ſeparate Peace, was by the Mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

The Emperour and <hi>Spain</hi> having then declar'd for <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
the <hi>French</hi> King took his Garriſons out of all the
conquer'd Places, having firſt exacted from them
great Contributions, except <hi>Naerden</hi> and <hi>Grave,</hi>
which were retaken by force. Thus the <hi>Hollanders</hi> got
all their places again except <hi>Maeſtricht; Rhinebergh</hi>
which belong'd to the Elector of <hi>Collen</hi> being reſtor'd
to him, and the Country of <hi>Cleves</hi> to the Elector of

<hi>Orange</hi> to the ſame Dignity, and that under better
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:65650:155"/>
Conditions than they had been in the poſſeſſion of his
Anceſtors. For the Common People, which already
favour'd the Houſe of <hi>Orange,</hi> being put quite into a
Conſternation by the prodigious Succeſs of the <hi>French,</hi>
and being perſuaded, that this Misfortune was occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
by the Treachery of ſome who ſat at the Helm,
and that no body but the Prince could reſtore the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay'd
State, did raiſe Tumults in moſt Cities, which
the Prince was forc'd to appeaſe, by depoſing the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Magiſtrates, and putting in their room ſuch as he

<hi>Cornelius</hi> and <hi>John du Witt,</hi>

though a great many are of Opinion, That eſpecially
the laſt of theſe, who had ſo long ſat at the Helm,
had better deſerv'd of his native Country. Tho the
Prince had been not a little inſtrumental in appeaſing
the Commotions, whereby <hi>Holland</hi> was put in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
to recover it ſelf, yet he was not ſo ſucceſsfull in

At laſt their Fear, that through long War their

People is to be attributed their Induſtry, increaſe of
Trade and great Riches; for in a Country which is
not the moſt fruitfull, and where every thing is very
dear, they muſt elſe of neceſſity periſh by Famine:
But moſt of the Inhabitants were tranſplanted thither
out of other Countries; out of <hi>France</hi> during the times

of the Civil Commotions; out of <hi>England</hi> under

of Religion and the Government; by its extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Conſtitutions and Conveniencies for Trade
and Correſpondency in all Parts; and at laſt, by the
great Reputation which the States have gain'd abroad,
by their wiſe Management at home, and Succeſs of
their Arms abroad. And becauſe every body, who
either brings ſome Means along with him, or has
learn'd ſomething to maintain himſelf withall, finds a
good Reception in <hi>Holland;</hi> even thoſe who are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted

bad, it being a common Cuſtom to ſpeak ill and
deſpicably of their Magiſtrates, as often as things do

very parſimonious, not much addicted to the Belly,
it being not the Cuſtom here to ſpend their yearly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
but to ſave every Year an overplus. This ſaving
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:65650:156"/>
way of living upholds their Credit, and enables them
to bear ſuch heavy Taxes without being ruin'd by
them. They are very fit for all ſorts of Manufactury,
and very much addicted to Commerce, not refuſing to
undergo any Labour or Danger, where ſomething is
to be got, and thoſe that underſtand Trade deal very
eaſily with them. They are very punctual in every
reſpect, pondering and ordering a thing very well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they begin it. And there is ſcarce any Nation in
the World ſo fit for Trade as the <hi>Dutch,</hi> this being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
praiſe-worthy in them, that they always chooſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

of <hi>Orenoque.</hi> Some of the moſt curious have obſerv'd,
that a great many things concurr in <hi>Holland</hi> for the
promoting of Trade, which are not to be met withall
all at once in any other Country: As for example,
the great quantity of People, the Conveniency and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
of the Country, the ſmall Intereſt which is paid
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:65650:157"/>
for Money, which ſhews the great Superfluity of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Money; the Severity us'd againſt Thieves, Cheats,
and Banquerooteers; the Bank of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> great
number of Convoys, and moderate Cuſtoms, that they
are ſo exact and regular in their way of Trading, that
the Magiſtrates are generally Merchants, or at leaſt,
ſuch as have an Intereſt in Commerce; That they are
Maſters in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> and that by reaſon of the
Frugality and Induſtry of the Inhabitants, far more
Commodities are exported than imported. And it is
obſervable, that tho' the <hi>Hollanders</hi> are Maſters of the
Spice in the <hi>Indies,</hi> yet they uſe them leaſt of all them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
They have alſo the greateſt ſhare in the Silk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trade
in <hi>Perſia,</hi> and yet they cloath themſelves in
Woollen Cloath, generally ſpeaking. Nay, they ſell
their fine Cloaths abroad, and ſend for courſer out of
<hi>England</hi> for their own uſe. They ſell their delicious
Butter, and ſend for other out of the <hi>North</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and <hi>Ireland</hi> for their uſe. <hi>French</hi> Wines and
Brandies are the chiefeſt Commodities which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
here, yet even when they make a Debauch,
they are not overlaviſhing.</p>
               <p>§.<note place="margin">Strength and Weakneſs of this Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</note> 21. From what has been ſaid, it is manifeſt that
the Strength of this Common-wealth is founded upon
Trade and its Naval Force, which is abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to maintain the former; nor is there any Country
ſo ſtock'd with good Seamen, for the ſetting out of a
great Fleet. But on the Land-ſide, where the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
cannot be under Water, it is not near ſo ſtrong. For
tho' they do not want Money to raiſe an Army of Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners,
yet is it not always adviſeable, for a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
to rely only upon ſuch as have no other
tye but their Pay, ſince they may eaſily prove un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull,
or elſe, miſ-led by the General, aſſiſt him in
over-turning the Liberty of the State. And it has been
in regard of this that ſome have adviſed, that the
Provinces of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand</hi> ſhould ſeparate
themſelves from the reſt, and only endeavour to
ſtrengthen themſelves betwixt the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> the <hi>Rhine,</hi>
and <hi>South-ſea;</hi> and in caſe of Neceſſity, by opening of
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:65650:158"/>
their Sluces, put the Country under-water; but for
the reſt, only endeavour to ſtrengthen themſelves at
Sea: But to examine this Propoſition, is not now my
buſineſs. There are ſeveral Inconveniences that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from the very Form of the Government of this
State. For, to ſpeak properly, theſe ſeven Provinces
do not make up one entire Common-wealth, but
there are ſeven Common wealths,<note place="margin">Form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</note> which by the Union
at <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht</hi> are joined into one Confederacy; they
have their Deputies conſtantly reſiding at the <hi>Hague,</hi>
whoſe buſineſs it is to take care of ſuch Affairs as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
the whole Union; and if any thing of moment
is to be decreed, they ſend to the ſeveral Provinces,
and according to the Approbation of theſe they make
their Decrees: theſe Deputies are called the States-General.
Nay, it ſeems that each Province is rather a
Confederacy, than one City or Common-wealth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the ſeveral Members of each Province do treat
with one another like Confederates, and not like one
Body, where one is ſuperiour to the other, or the
majority of Votes determines a buſineſs. For even in
the Provincial Aſſemblies a great many things cannot
be determined by the Plurality of Votes, but every
Member's conſent is required. Which ſhows, that theſe
Provinces and Cities not united by ſo ſtrong a Tye, as
thoſe who are govern'd by one Soveraign, except as
far as Neceſſity obliges them to keep together. And
the great Cities are fill'd with Rabble; which if once
put in motion, uſes to make ſtrange work among
them. It is therefore the great Care of the Magiſtrates,
that they are kept in conſtant Employment to get
Bread, for Famine would quickly be the occaſion of
great Tumults here. There is alſo a Jealouſie betwixt
<hi>Holland</hi> and the other Provinces; the latter pretending
to ſome Prerogative, as being the moſt Powerfull, and
contributing moſt to the Publick; whereas the others
are for maintaining their Liberty and Equality. All
the reſt of the Cities are eſpecially jealous of <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
becauſe this City draws abundance of Trade from
the reſt, and puts them in apprehenſion, as if She were
ambitious to domineer over them. But the greateſt
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:65650:158"/>
Irregularity happens in their Conſtitution, by means of
the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prince of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range.</hi>
                  </note> who having the Favour of the
Common people, of the Land-Souldiers and the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
(for the Clergy hate the <hi>Arminians,</hi> who being
of the <hi>Barnefelt</hi> Faction, are Enemies of the Prince)
ſeems to endanger their Liberty. Wherefore the chief
Men in the Cities, to whom belongs the Magiſtracy
there, poſſeſs their places in continual fear, except they
will be pliable to the Prince of <hi>Orange;</hi> Whoſe intereſt
is alſo inconſiſtent with that of the State, becauſe no
Land way can be advantageous for <hi>Holland;</hi> whereas
in time of War, his Authority is much greater than
otherwiſe. And therefore according to this Form of
the Government, ſcarce a firm Peace can be eſtabliſh'd
at home. It may eaſily happen that the Prince may
aſpire to be their Soveraign.<note place="margin">1675.</note> And when the Province
of <hi>Gueldres</hi> did offer to him the Soveraignty, he did
give them to underſtand, That if all the reſt were of
the ſame Opinion, they ſhould have no occaſion to
look for him behind the Wine-pipes, as the <hi>Jews</hi> did
for <hi>Saul;</hi> yet the wiſer ſort are of opinion, that he
would reap no great benefit from this Soveraignty,
ſince it would be ſcarce poſſible to keep ſo many great
Cities in Obedience againſt their Will. For Cittadels
and Garriſons would prove the Ruin of Trade, which
never flouriſhes where abſolute Power controuls the
Subject. Wherefore it ſeems more adviſeable for the
Prince to be ſatisfied with what Power he has, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
certain, that if he knows how to manage the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
of the People, he is almoſt able to do what he
pleaſes.<note place="margin">Whether it is their advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to have a Soveraignty.</note> It has been a great Diſpute, whether it be
for the advantage of theſe <hi>Netherlands,</hi> to have a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
General. Thoſe who are for the Affirmative,
alledge, That this Country having been from ancient
Time under the Juriſdiction of a limited Soveraignty,
has been uſed to that Form of Government; That it
conduces to the outward Splendour of the Common-wealth,
and to uphold the Authority of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
in the Cities; That thereby Factions and Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults
are kept under and ſuppreſſed. That thereby
are prevented a great many Inconveniences in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:65650:159"/>
any deſigns of moment, which were incident to
an Ariſtocratical and Democratical State; <hi>viz.</hi> Slow
and divided Counſels in Conſultations, delays in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions,
and the divulging of ſecret Deſigns; all which
we will leave undetermin'd here. This is alſo to be
eſteemed one of the Weakneſſes of this Common-wealth,
that ſo great a number of Inhabitants cannot
be maintained by the Product of the Land, but muſt
get their Bread from abroad, and by the help of Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners.
Wherefore the certain Ruin of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
is at hand,<note place="margin">Other Defects of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.</note> when-ever its Trade and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation
ſhould be ſtopt; which however is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
impoſſible to happen. The difference of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
is commonly reckoned among the weakneſſes of
a State. But ſome make this one of the main Pillars
of the flouriſhing Condition of <hi>Holland,</hi> becauſe it
contributes greatly to the Strength and Encreaſe of
this State. The Reformed Religion is here the Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd
Religion, all the reſt being only tolerated:
The <hi>Papiſts</hi> are connived at, but alſo they keep over
them a ſtrict Eye, for fear the Prieſts, who all depend
on the Pope, ſhould enter into a Correſpondency with
<hi>Spain.</hi> Yet it is rarely ſeen in <hi>Holland,</hi> that one Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
hates the other, or proſecutes him upon the Score
of Religion. It has been the Saying of ſome, that in
other Countries Religion doth more good, but in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
leſs harm. It is alſo very inconvenient for the
Inhabitants, that all ſorts of Victuals are ſold at ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive
a Rate: The reaſon of which is, That the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Revenues of <hi>Holland,</hi> are raiſed by way of Exciſe
upon theſe Commodities; and it is a common Saying,
That before you can get a Diſh of Fiſh ready dreſs'd
upon your Table at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> you have paid above
Thirty ſeveral Taxes for it. And notwithſtanding all
theſe heavy Impoſitions, the State is much in debt.
There are ſome alſo who pretend, that the Traffick of
the <hi>Dutch</hi> does grow leſs and leſs; for which they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
ſeveral Reaſons; <hi>viz.</hi> That ſince the Peace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
at <hi>Munſter,</hi> other Nations have alſo applied
themſelves to Trade. That the Price of the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi>
Commodities does fall every Year, and yet the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:65650:159"/>
of the Company increaſes daily. For whereas for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
five or ſix <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Ships coming home year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
were reckon'd very conſiderable, now eighteen or
twenty do return; which ſo over-ſtocks them with
theſe Commodities, that they are obliged to lay them
up in their Ware-houſes for a conſiderable time, before
they can vent them without Loſs. They alledge all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
that Corn has been of late years ſo abundant in
<hi>France, Spain, Italy</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> that the <hi>Hollanders</hi>
have not ſent much of it into theſe Parts, it being
their cuſtom to fetch Corn from off the <hi>Eaſt-Sea,</hi>
where they vent, in exchange of it, moſt or their
Spices: That the great Addition of Fortifications and
ſumptuous Buildings to the City of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> have
taken up a great quantity of Ready-money, which
might have been better employed in way of Trade;
and that Luxury and Debauchery does encreaſe daily
in that City. But the Reaſon why the <hi>Hollanders</hi> had
ſuch ill Succeſs at the beginning of this War, ſeems to
be, that by the great Eagerneſs of Gain and Trade,
their Martial Heat was almoſt extinguiſh'd; and that
after the Peace concluded at <hi>Munſter,</hi> they being not
apprehenſive of any Invaſion by Land, they only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
themſelves to ſtrengthen their Power at Sea;
and having diſmiſſed their beſt Officers, they had ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
their place with their own Relations; whoſe
Motto was,<note place="margin">1665.</note> 
                  <hi>Peace and a good Government.</hi> For at
the time of the War with <hi>England</hi> they had diſmiſſed
the Old <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bands; and in the Year 1668, the
<hi>French</hi> Troops, both which were the flower of their
Armies, which of neceſſity muſt have been reduced
into a very ill condition, ſince the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>
had no more concern with them. Beſides this, they
thought themſelves very ſecure, not imagining that
<hi>France</hi> would either dare, or be able to attempt a
Conqueſt over them, as long as they were ſure, that
the Emperour and <hi>Spain</hi> would ſide with them; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did they imagine that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> would join with
the <hi>French</hi> againſt them. And at laſt they hoped,
they would beat the <hi>Engliſh</hi> out of the Sea, before
<hi>France</hi> ſhould be able to take three or four Places.
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:65650:160"/>
They relied upon the old Way of making of War,
when a whole Company was taken up with the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of one Place, and when whole Books were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
of the Taking of <hi>Groll,</hi> or the Sar of <hi>Ghent.</hi>
It is alſo believed, that ſome of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> were
not ſorry, that they had no great Succeſs by Land,
hoping thereby to bring into diſcredit the Conduct, and
to diminiſh the Authority of the Prince, whom they
had been obliged to make their Captain-General a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
their Will.</p>
               <p>§.<note place="margin">The Neighbours of <hi>Holland.</hi>
                  </note> 22. As for the Neighbours of <hi>Holland,</hi> and
what it has to fear or to hope from them; it ſeems
that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are the moſt dangerous Neighbours
to the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> they being the only Nation that
have been formidable to them hitherto, againſt their
Pretenſions to the Dominion of the Seas and Trade;
who are extreamly diſſatisfied, that this new Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
which, when it was in a very tottering
condition, was ſtrongly upheld by them, has now
been before-hand with them in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> and
daily ſpoil their Markets almoſt every-where. For,
becauſe an <hi>Engliſh-man</hi> is naturally proud,<note place="margin">England.</note> and loves
to live well; whereas a <hi>Hollander</hi> minds nothing ſo
much as his Gain, being ſatisfied with an indifferent
ſhare, nor ſpends any thing idly; a <hi>Hollander</hi> can ſell
cheaper than an <hi>Engliſh-man,</hi> and Strangers will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
rather deal with the firſt than the laſt. It is
therefore in all probability the chief Intereſt of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
not to irritate <hi>England,</hi> and rather to allow
them ſome Ceremonial Prerogatives at Sea, ſuch as
ſtriking, and the like; but withall to ſtrengthen their
Power at Sea, that, in caſe <hi>England</hi> ſhould really con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
with them for the Trade and Fiſhing, it may be
able to make head againſt them. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> muſt
alſo, as much as is poſſible, endeavour to encourage
the ſame ſort of Manufacture, as is in <hi>England,</hi> and
either to make theſe Commodities better, or at leaſt
to ſell them cheaper, thereby to get the advantage
from them. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> ought to ſtand in great
fear of <hi>France</hi> on the Land-ſide,<note place="margin">France.</note> eſpecially ſince that
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:65650:160"/>
King is their great Enemy, having oppoſed for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
time all their Deſigns. It is therefore very
neceſſary to be in a good poſture on the Land-ſide,
and to keep fair with the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> who
elſe would permit the <hi>French</hi> to march through
their Territories, or elſe perhaps join with him.
They muſt endeavour the Preſervation of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
Netherlands,</hi> which they ought to conſider as
their Frontiers, and whereby <hi>Spain</hi> is obliged al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
to Side with <hi>Holland</hi> againſt <hi>France.</hi> They
muſt take care to be provided with good Officers,
and to put the Province of <hi>Holland</hi> into a better
Poſture of Defence on the ſide of <hi>Gueldres.</hi> It is
not eaſie to be ſuppoſed, that <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi>
will join again againſt <hi>Holland,</hi> which may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
by the <hi>Hollanders.</hi> It is alſo the Intereſt of
<hi>Holland</hi> to take care, that the Naval Strength of
<hi>France</hi> do not increaſe too much, and to prevent,
as much as in them lies, that they do not ſettle a
Trade in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies.</hi> And becauſe <hi>France</hi> draws
the Riches of all <hi>Europe</hi> to it ſelf by its Manufactu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
the <hi>Hollanders</hi> muſt try to imitate them, and
furniſh other Nations with the like.<note place="margin">Spain.</note> From <hi>Spain,
Holland</hi> need fear nothing either by Sea or Land,
ſince that time, that this Kingdom has loſt all its
labour againſt them. Nay, it is their Common In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
now that they cultivate a mutual good Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
to ſtop the Progreſſes of the <hi>French</hi>
in the <hi>Netherlands:</hi> And the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have ſcarce
any thing left them, from which the <hi>Dutch</hi> could
have any proſpect of Benefit, they being not in a
Capacity to conquer or to maintain the <hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi>
And though the <hi>Hollanders</hi> may be very trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Silver Fleets, yet the <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Privateers may alſo do them conſiderable miſchief.
<hi>Portugal</hi> has no Pretenſions againſt <hi>Holland,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Portugal.</note> and it
ought moſt to ſtand in fear of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
theſe would be glad of an opportunity to take
from the <hi>Portugueſe Broſile,</hi> and what they have left
in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> which however they would not

are obliged to fetch their Bread out of the <hi>Eaſt-Sea;</hi>
they have always taken care that neither of the

which Balance is the eaſier kept now, ſince the

it is notorious enough what Game they have play'd

Intereſt of <hi>Holland,</hi> to keep fair with all other
Princes, thereby to maintain a free Commerce every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.
And in theſe Places where they cannot Trade
alone, it is the Intereſt of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> either by
goodneſs or cheapneſs of their Commodities, and an
eaſie Deportment to endeavour to draw the chief
Benefit of Trade to themſelves. For this is the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier
and leſs odious Way to heap up Riches, than if
they ſhould attempt publickly to mix the Foreign
Trade of all other Nations; ſince it would prove
impoſſible for them alone to maintain a general

<hi>France</hi> ſeems to have no great reaſon to attack the

and beſides this, by ſelling the Church Benefices

Miſchief to the Empire. Wherefore <hi>Henry</hi>

had got all the beſt Poſſeſſions of the Empire

<hi>Hildebrand</hi> or <hi>Gregory</hi> VII. and his Succeſſours, did
raiſe a more dreadful Storm againſt him; for the Popes
having long ſince been vexed to the Heart, that they

Free in his younger Years, and the Church Benefices ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been rather beſtowed upon Favourites or ſuch as
payed well for them, than ſuch as deſerved them, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
the Pope with a ſpecious Pretence to make a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,
that it was not the Emperour's right to beſtow
Biſhopricks or other Church Benefices upon any Body,
but that it did belong to the Pope. The Emperour was
alſo ſummoned to appear at <hi>Rome,</hi> and to give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count

he was threatened with an Excommunication. On
the other Hand, the Emperour having declared the Pope
unworthy of his Office, would have depoſed him. So
the Pope excommunicated the Emperour, diſcharging all
his Subjects from their Allegiance due to him, which
proved of ſuch Conſequence in thoſe Times, that all
his Authority fell to the Ground at once among moſt of

Extremity. For moſt Princes aſſembled at <hi>Trebes,</hi> where

                  <note place="margin">Matthias.</note> the ill Humours
did ſo encreaſe by degrees in <hi>Germany,</hi> that towards his
latter days they cauſed violent Convulſions. The origin
of this war, which laſted thirty years, was this: In
the Religious Peace formerly concluded at <hi>Paſſau,</hi> two
Parties were only included, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi>
and thoſe who adher'd to the <hi>Augsburgh</hi> Confeſſion,<note place="margin">Origin of <hi>the German</hi> Wars.</note>
the free exerciſe of Religion being forbidden to all others.
But ſome of the States of the Empire, among whom
the chiefeſt were the Elector <hi>Palatin</hi> and the Landgrave
of <hi>Heſſe Caſſel,</hi> having ſince that time receiv'd the
Reform'd Religion, commonly call'd the <hi>Calvinian,</hi>
the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> were againſt their enjoying the
benefit of the Religious Peace. Theſe on the other
hand alledged, that they did belong, as well as the
reſt, to the <hi>Augsburgh</hi> Confeſſion, and that the whole
difference did only conſiſt in ſome few paſſages: But
the reſt of the Proteſtants who ſtrictly adher'd to the
Words of the <hi>Augsburgh</hi> Confeſſion, were not for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
them into the ſame Communion, yet it was
their opinion, that they ought not to be proſecuted for
the differences that were betwixt them. But afterwards
theſe controverted Articles were by the heat of the
Prieſts explain'd in ſo different a manner, that the name
of a <hi>Calviniſt</hi> became as odious to ſome Proteſtants, as
that of a <hi>Roman Catholick.</hi> The <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hold of this opportunity, careſſed the old Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,
eſpecially thoſe in the Electorate of <hi>Saxony,</hi>
unto whom they repreſented the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> as a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
equally deſtructive to both Parties; whereby
they hop'd to disjoyn them from the reſt, and after
they had deſtroy'd them, to make the eaſier work with
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:65650:175"/>
the reſt of the Proteſtants. Theſe therefore of the
Reformed Religion, entered into a Confederacy for
their common ſecurity; into which there having

Power here circumſcribed within certain bounds,

Form of Government, the like is not to be met withal

<hi>Germany</hi> acknowledges but one Supreme Head, under

of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Protection of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
and her Patrimony. This Dignity was firſt annexed
to the <hi>German</hi> Empire by <hi>Otto</hi> I. but it is long ago
ſince the Popes have robb'd the Kings of <hi>Germany</hi>
of this Power, and only have left them the bare Name.
But beſides this, the Eſtates of <hi>Germany,</hi> ſome of which
have great and potent Countries in their poſſeſſion,
have a conſiderable ſhare of the Sovereignty over their
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:65650:179"/>
Subjects; and tho they are Vaſſals of the Emperour
and Empire, nevertheleſs they ought not to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd

'tis true, is a main obſtacle that the Emperour cannot
make himſelf abſolute in the Empire, except it be in
his Hereditary Countries; yet this has been always ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd,
the more potent the Emperour is, the more he
has exerciſed his Authority, and the Eſtates have been
forced to comply with his commands: and it is certain,
that the grandure of the Eſtates, except what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the <hi>Golden Bull</hi> concerning the Electoral
Dignity, was more founded upon antient Cuſtoms and

concerning ſeveral Articles of Faith; which, by the

that both Parties were brought to the very brink of

Diſtemper, it being next to an impoſſibility, that among
ſo many, there ſhould not be ſome, who either promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by their paſſions, obſtinacy, or for want of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
may not deviate from the true Intereſt,
or be miſled by ill Counſellours to act againſt the ſame;
ſo that it would be a miracle to ſee ſo many Heads not
well united. The Eſtates are alſo very unequal in Power;
from whence it often happens, that ſome of the moſt
Potent are for being like Sovereigns, and therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
inclin'd rather to act according to their particular
Intereſt and Grandeur than for the Publick, they make
little account how they Ruin the leſs powerful. Theſe
therefore, when they ſee that the Laws cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect

their own preſervation, than of the Publick Liberty,

There was a certain Perſon in <hi>Poland</hi> who pretended

Duke of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> and that he was to have been mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:65650:198"/>
by the Order of <hi>Boris Gudenow,</hi> who hoped
thereby to obtain the Succeſſion in the Empire after

This Man having found great Encouragement from <hi>George

Daughter. Wherefore this <hi>Vayvod</hi> with the Aſſiſtance
of ſome other <hi>Poliſh</hi> Lords having gathered an Army
that marched with <hi>Demetrius</hi> into <hi>Muſcovy:</hi> And the

ſoon after,<note place="margin">1605.</note> 
                  <hi>Demetrius</hi> was well received by the <hi>Ruſſians;</hi>

to the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> they ſuſpecting him to be an
Impoſtor, but did however hide their reſentments till
the arrival of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Bride. In the mean while the
<hi>Muſcovites</hi> (under the Conduct of thoſe of <hi>Suski,</hi> who
were by their Mother's ſide deſcended from the Family
of the Grand Dukes) had under-hand got together about
20000 Men.<note place="margin">1606.</note> Theſe at the time when the Nuptials were
celebrating with great Pomp, raiſed a Tumult, attacked
the Caſtle, and cut to pieces <hi>Demetrius</hi> and a great many

               <p>Then <hi>Baſilius Suski</hi> was proclaimed Great Duke in the

was ſpread abroad, that <hi>Demetrius</hi> was eſcaped, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
appeared ſoon after, who pretended to be the
ſame <hi>Demetrius.</hi> Whether it was the ſame or not, is not

him as ſuch, they being very deſirous to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
the former Affront and the Death of their Friends.
This Old or New <hi>Demetrius</hi> did march with a great

                  <note place="margin">1086.</note> where

very well, for the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Troops immediatly left the

the perſwaſions of ſome of his Friends refuſed this offer,
thinking it more for his purpoſe to Conquer <hi>Muſcovy</hi> by

Miſchiefs upon the <hi>Poles.</hi> The buſineſs happened thus:
As the number of the <hi>Coſacks</hi> was greatly encreaſed by

this, it was decreed in the Dyet, that all their former

that whoſoever is not a Nobleman in <hi>Poland,</hi> is
eſteemed a Boor. For the Inhabitants of the Cities are very
little regarded, and the Tradeſmen are moſt Foreigners.
But the Boors are eſteemed nor uſed no better than
Slaves, being alſo very raw and barbarous, both in their
Life and Converſation, wherefore when we talk of the
<hi>Poles,</hi> thereby ought only to be underſtood the Nobility.
They are therefore commonly downright and honeſt,
very ſeldom given to the art of diſſembling; they are of
a very generous ſpirit, and expect a great deal of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:65650:202"/>
And if you give them as much reſpect as they
pretend to, they are no leſs courteous, and will willingly
pay a reſpect again to you; and their words and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
are full of Pomp and Ceremony. They are
very liberal, or rather profuſe; and not given to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimonious,
tho they ſhould want the next day. This
Nation alſo is very fierce and extravagant, much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
to an uncountroled liberty, or rather licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and petulancy. Wherefore Plots and Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
againſt their Kings are frequent among them, whoſe
Actions they canvaſe with a great deal of freedom, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
always jealous of the leaſt point of their Liberty.
They do not want courage, but they are more fit to
act with a ſudden heat, than to endure long the fatigues
of War. And becauſe the Nobles only apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to the War, who never ſerve but on Horſeback,
and the reſt of the Inhabitants are of no great ſpirit,
their infantry gathered out of the Natives is not worth
much, wherefore they are obliged in their ſtead to make
uſe of Foreigners liſted into their Service, or of the
<hi>Coſacks,</hi> who are courageous and active.</p>

is moſt conſumed by the Inhabitants, who make Mead
of it; the reſt is exported, as likewiſe abundance of
Wax, Hemp, Flax, Leather, Pot-aſlies, Salt, Wood,
and the like. But on the contrary the Commodities
which are imported here are Silk, woollen Stuffs and
Cloaths, Tapeſtries, Sables, <hi>Hungarian</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Wines, abundance of Spice, which they uſe in great
quantity in their Dyet. If the <hi>Poles</hi> were addicted in

                  <hi>Poland</hi> is very populous and full of Towns and Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages.

the Biſhops and Canons 100550, the reſt of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,

200000, out of the Nobility. Which ſeems to be
a little largely ſpoken, except you would reckon among
them their Servants. This is certain that in no King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Europe</hi> there is ſo great a number of Nobles.
They alſo may find a way to raiſe a proportionable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry

the miſchief, that the King cannot levy any extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Taxes, without the conſent of the Nobility, and
both the Clergy and the Nobility are very backward
in paying of any Taxes, or at leaſt grow quickly aweary

And this is the reaſon why the King of <hi>Poland</hi> cannot
carry on a War long with vigour. Beſides this when
the Nobles are ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

in them, that where 10000 fighting Men are,
at leaſt five times the number of Servants and idle Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows

               <p>§. 17. Concerning their Form of Government;<note place="margin">Their form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> it
is to be obſerved that the <hi>Poles</hi> live under one Head,
who bears the Title, and lives in the Splendour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
a King; but if you conſider his Power, which
is circumſcribed within very narrow bounds, he is in
effect no more than the Prime or Chief Regent in a
Free Commonwealth. This King is always choſen by
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:65650:203"/>
a free Election, where every Noble Man there preſent
has his Vote; and tho the <hi>Poles</hi> have been always in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
to keep to the Royal Race, yet have they never
been for declaring a Succeſſour during the life of the
preſent King, but have always expected the vacancy of
the Throne, as being of opinion, that this time is the
moſt proper to aboliſh ſuch Abuſes as perhaps are crept
in under the former Reign, and to prevent all means
which may prove prejudicial afterwards to their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties.
But, that, during this Vacancy, all diſorders
may be prevented, Juſtice is then exerciſed with more
ſeverity than at other times: the Archbiſhop of <hi>Guieſen,</hi>
who is the Primate of <hi>Poland,</hi> being in the mean while
the Regent, or as it were Interrex of the Kingdom.
The <hi>Poles</hi> have had for a conſiderable time this Maxim,
that they would rather chooſe a King out of a Foreign
Princely Family, than out of their own Nobility; as
being of Opinion that thereby the equality among the
Nobility may be better preſerved; for a Foreigner is no
more engaged to one than to another; whereas a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
always prefers his Kindred and Relations before the
reſt: and this Rule they have obſerved ever ſince the
time of <hi>Jagello,</hi> who being a <hi>Lituanian,</hi> united <hi>Litua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi>
with <hi>Poland.</hi> But they had not the ſame good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
with <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> partly becauſe
the ſituation of theſe two Kingdoms is ſuch: that both
cannot well be governed by one King; partly becauſe
they were thereby engaged in a heavy War againſt
<hi>Swedeland,</hi> which elſe might eaſily have been avoided;
but they have been always very careful not to take their
Kings out of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> fearing leſt they
ſhould be treated like the <hi>Hungarians</hi> and <hi>Bohemians.</hi>
In the two laſt Elections they have choſen two Kings
out of their own Nobility, and whether thereby theſe
Factions which have hitherto been predominant in that
Kingdom, can be ſuppreſſed, time will ſhew. This
Elective King has a great Revenue out of the Lands
belonging to the Crown,<note place="margin">The Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues of the King.</note> and has the ſole power to
diſpoſe of all vacant Offices, Dignities and Benefices;
but he cannot make new Laws, begin a War<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> impoſe
new Taxes, or undertake any other Matters of great
moment, without the conſent of the Eſtates. The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:65650:204"/>
in <hi>Poland</hi> are compoſed of the Biſhops and ſome
Abbots,<note place="margin">The Eſtates of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</note> of the Palatins or Vaywods, which are Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
of the Provinces, of the Caſtellans or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
of Caſtles, and of the chief Officers of the
Kingdom; theſe compoſe the Senate, which conſiſted
formerly of 150 Perſons; beſides theſe there are the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties
of the Nobility out of each Diſtrict, who have
almoſt the ſame power which the Tribunes of the People
had at <hi>Rome;</hi> ſince one ſingle perſon among them by
entring his Proteſt may annul a Decree at the Dyet;
and theſe Deputies uſe their Tongues very freely at the
Dyet, both againſt the King and his Miniſters; from
whence it often happens that Matters are debated here
with great confuſion, ſince by the capricious humour
of one Deputy the benefit of the whole Dyet is loſt
at once; eſpecially ſince a certain time of ſix weeks is
prefixed by the Laws for the holding of the Dyet,
which they rarely ſuffer to be Prorogued, and that not
but for a very few days; but they call this right of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting,
the Soul of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Liberty. The King
is alſo obliged to beſtow all the vacant Benefices upon
the Nobility, and cannot reſerve any for his own uſe,
or beſtow them upon his Children without conſent
of the Eſtates,<note place="margin">Of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of Juſtice.</note> neither can he buy or take poſſeſſion of
any Noblemens Lands. The King alſo is not Maſter of
the Judicial Courts; but there is a certain High Court
of Juſtice, the Judges whereof are Nobles: firſt Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
by King <hi>Stephen Batori.</hi> Theſe Judges are
changed every twelve months, and keep their Seſſion
ſix months in the year at <hi>Petricovia,</hi> and ſix months a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
at <hi>Lublin,</hi> and from theſe no Appeal lies to the
King; except that ſome Caſes of the greateſt Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
are determined at the Dyet; but Caſes belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the King's Exchequer, or to his Revenues, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
by the King. The <hi>Poles</hi> are extreamly fond
of this form of Government, as being very ſuitable to
their natural fierce inclinations; yet the ſame is very
improper for any ſudden and great undertaking; and
contributes not a little to the weakneſs of this vaſt
Kingdom, eſpecially when the Nobility is refractory,
and jealous of the King.</p>

not powerful enough to conquer <hi>Poland,</hi> or to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
a Country which is of ſo vaſt an extent and very
populous, and lying all upon a level is not ſecured by
any fortified places. If no body elſe ſhould ſide with
<hi>Poland,</hi> the <hi>Turks</hi> themſelves would not eaſily ſuffer that

and the <hi>Turks</hi> are the fitteſt inſtruments to prevent it.
But the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> has often endeavoured, tho
the wiſeſt among the <hi>Poles</hi> have always oppoſed it, to
unite the Kingdom of <hi>Poland</hi> to their Family by an
Election; but the <hi>Poles</hi> are conſcious of the danger

very praiſe-worthy can be ſaid. For among them there
is no ſuch Education as among moſt other <hi>European</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Reading and Writing being the higheſt Degree
of Learning among them, and the Learning of their
Prieſts themſelves does not go further than to be able
to read a Chapter out of the Bible, or to read a piece of
a Sermon. They are alſo jealous, cruel and bloody-minded;
inſupportably proud in proſperity, and deje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
and cowardly in adverſity. Nevertheleſs they
have ſuch an Opinion of their own Abilities and Merits,
that you can ſcarce ever pay them ſufficient Reſpect.
They are very fit for and cunning in the Trade of Uſury,
but are of a ſervile Temper, and muſt be kept under
by ſeverity. At all ſorts of Games and Sports their end
is with blows and fighting; ſo Sticks and Whips are the
uſual Inſtruments among them. They are of a ſtrong
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:65650:208"/>
Conſtitution, able to undergo all ſorts of Fatigues, even
Famine and Thirſt. In Field-Fights and Sieges they are
worth nothing, becauſe they are ſoon brought into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion,
and are themſelves of Opinion, that other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are their Maſters in this Point. But they defend a
Fortreſs to the utmoſt, not only becauſe they are very
fit to undergo hardſhips and all ſorts of miſery, but alſo
becauſe they know it is preſent death to them if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
home after they have ſurrendred a Fortreſs by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.
Nevertheleſs, they do endeavour to bring their
Soldiers under better Diſcipline, for which purpoſe, they
make uſe of a great many <hi>Scotch</hi> and <hi>German</hi> Officers,
who are to inſtruct them in all manner of Exerciſes as
practiſed among other <hi>European</hi> Nations. But they do
not allow that the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> ſhould ſerve abroad and
learn themſelves the perfection of Military Arts and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes,
becauſe the Grand Duke ſtands in fear, that if
they ſhould grow too knowing, they might be for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Innovations at home.</p>
               <p>§ 6.<note place="margin">The Nature of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities.</note> The Territories of the preſent Grand Duke of
<hi>Muſcovy</hi> are of a very large extent, yet ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that a great
many parts are meer Wilderneſſes ſcarce inhabited at all.
The <hi>Muſcovites</hi> have at home great plenty of Corn,
Cattel, all ſorts of Game, Fiſh, Salt, Furrs and all other
Neceſſaries. They have a great many Commodities fit
for exportation, eſpecially, Furrs and their precious Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
which are eſteemed at a high Rate among their
Neighbours, Salt-Fiſh, Caſiarr, Hides, Tallow, Wax,
Honey, Pot-aſhes, Soap, Hemp, and the like. But the
Commodities which are imported to them are Silk, Stuffs,
Gold, Silver and Woollen Cloths, Tapeſtry, Pearls and
Precious Stones, Spices and Wines, but the latter not
in any great Quantities; Tobaco is now a prohibited
Commodity there. They keep it for a conſtant Cuſtom
in their way of Trade, not to buy with ready Money,
but to exchange Commodities for Commodities, and it
is againſt the Conſtitutions of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> to export any
Coin. Their greateſt Trade is at <hi>Archangel,</hi> which way
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> firſt found out in the Year 1553. But ſince
that time the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and <hi>Hamburgers</hi> have followed
their Example. Before that time, this Trade was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:65650:208"/>
on by the way of <hi>Narva</hi> and <hi>Reval,</hi> but tho' this
was the ſhorter way, yet did the foreign Merchants not
care to be ſo much in ſubjection to the <hi>Swedes</hi> and <hi>Danes.</hi>
There is alſo a conſiderable Trade carried on with the
<hi>Perſians</hi> upon the River of <hi>Wolga</hi> by the way of
<hi>Aſtracan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 7.<note place="margin">Form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</note> The Form of Government here is an abſolute
Monarchy; the Grand Duke, whom they call in their
Native Language <hi>Ozar,</hi> being not tied up to any Laws
or Rules, unto whom his Subjects are obliged to pay
Obedience without reſerve, ſo that they are no more
than Slaves, which alſo ſutes beſt with their natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.
And therefore this abſolute Power of the
Prince is a great addition to his Strength,<note place="margin">Strength of the Country.</note> ſince he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
only raiſe ſome Hundred Thouſands of Men at the
firſt Command, but alſo has vaſt Riches and prodigious
Revenues. Theſe do accrue to him, not only out of the
Taxes and income of ſo vaſt a Country, but alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Grand Duke himſelf has the monopoly of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
and if I am not much miſtaken, alſo Farms out all
publick Inns, Taverns and Ale-houſes himſelf, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts
to a prodigious Revenue in a Country where
the Nation is much addicted to drinking. He makes alſo
his Preſents to Foreign Princes and Ambaſſadours in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
but receives in lieu of them Gold and Silver. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
this, it is a common Cuſtom with him, to ſet a
new Stamp upon Crown Pieces, and to oblige his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to take them for double the value: From whence
it cannot be ſuppoſed but that this Prince muſt lay up
vaſt Treaſures. <hi>Muſcovy</hi> alſo enjoys this Advantage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
other States, that it is not to be attack'd on the
backſide, becauſe its Territories are on the North-Eaſt
ſide ſurrounded by a vaſt unnavigable Sea, and vaſt
Wilderneſſes.</p>

the <hi>Perſians.</hi> Theſe two States cannot hurt one

and vaſt Wilderneſſes being their common Borders;
wherefore it is not worth their while to extend their
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:65650:209"/>
Conqueſts upon one another. But they may be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
to one another by making a Diverſion to the
<hi>Turks.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tartars.</note> The <hi>Tartars</hi> are woubleſome Neighbours to the
<hi>Muſcovites,</hi> who make no account of Faith or Alliances,
but make a Trade of Robbing and Plundering, againſt
whom there is no Remedy, but to kill them as faſt as
one can; and this is not ſo eaſily to be done, becauſe
they are very nimble. The <hi>Crim-Tartars</hi> are the moſt
miſchievous to <hi>Poland,</hi> to hinder their Incurſions, the
<hi>Muſcovites</hi> are obliged to keep a conſiderable number of
Horſe upon the Frontiers, and they give them ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
a Diverſion, with the help of the <hi>Doniſque Coſacks,</hi>
and the <hi>Nagage</hi> and <hi>Calmuck-Tartars.</hi> If the <hi>Muſcovites</hi>
could maintain themſelves in <hi>Kiovia,</hi> and a part of the
<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>kraine,</hi> it would ſerve them at once to bridle theſe
Robbers, and for a Bulwark againſt the <hi>Turks.</hi> For the
<hi>Turks</hi> do not immediately border upon <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> but by
the Country of the <hi>Crim-Tartars,</hi> who being Vaſſals of
the <hi>Turks,</hi> they make uſe of them like their hunting
Dogs. Wherefore it is of great conſequence to <hi>Muſcovy,</hi>
that the <hi>Turks</hi> do not become Maſters of the whole <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>kraine,</hi>
ſince thereby they would be enabled with the help of
the <hi>Coſacks</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi> to do great miſchief to <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Muſcovites</hi> ought to have a watchful Eye over
the <hi>Poles,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Poland.</note> they being ſo ſituated, that they may do the
greateſt miſchief to <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> eſpecially ſince the <hi>Poles</hi>
are much better Souldiers than the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> in the
Field. But the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> have at preſent a great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
againſt <hi>Poland,</hi> ſince they are poſſeſſed of <hi>Smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lensko,
Severia</hi> and <hi>Kiovia,</hi> which cover their Frontiers
on that ſide. <hi>Muſcovy</hi> need not fear any thing much
from that ſide where it borders on <hi>Sweden,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sweden.</note> not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is able enough to defend it ſelf there, if every
thing is quiet at home, but alſo becauſe the <hi>Swedes</hi> are
not ambitious to make any more Conqueſts on that ſide,
ſince to maintain ſuch large and far diſtant Countries,
would be more hurtful than profitable to their State.
And the Kings of <hi>Sweden</hi> have of late ſhewed no great
inclination to fight with the <hi>Muſcovites.</hi> But if the <hi>Swedes</hi>
in conjunction with the <hi>Poles</hi> ſhould attack the <hi>Muſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,</hi>
                  <pb n="367" facs="tcp:65650:209"/>
they would put them very hard to it; whereas
alſo the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> may prove very troubleſome to <hi>Swede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
if they ſhould join in conjunction with the Enemies
of <hi>Swedeland.</hi> Nevertheleſs, the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> ought not to
make any great account upon an Alliance with <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi>
becauſe they are far diſtant from one another, and
therefore cannot revenge themſelves upon one another;

ways: Firſt, As far as the Articles which
are taught by him and differ from other Chriſtians, are
agreeable or diſagreeable with the Holy Scriptures, and
conſequently uſeful or prejudicial to Salvation, which
Conſideration we leave to Divines. Secondly, As far
as the Pope is not only poſſeſs'd of a conſiderable Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality
in <hi>Italy,</hi> but alſo pretends to be the Sovereign
and Supreme Head of Chriſtendom, at leaſt in Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Matters, and in effect, exerciſes the ſaid Power in
thoſe States of <hi>Europe</hi> which profeſs themſelves of the

               <p>This ſecond Conſideration belongs to the Politicians,
for this ſpiritual Sovereignty does introduce great altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and interferes with the Supreme Civil Power;
nay, circumſcribes and maims it. Wherefore ſince Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
has been ſo interwoven with the Civil Intereſt, it
belongs to the perfection of an underſtanding Politician,
to be well inſtructed whence this Spiritual Monarchy had
its Original, and by what means it hath ſo mightily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
and is preſerved. From whence alſo will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
of what nature are the chiefeſt Controverſies now
in vogue among Chriſtians in the Weſtern Parts of the
World, how far they are owing either to the various
Interpretations of the Holy Scripture, or to worldly
Intereſt; ſo that from thence a Wiſe Man may eaſily
judge, whether at any time theſe Controverſies are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

§ 2. Now to look back to the firſt beginning of things,
we find, that before the Nativity of our Saviour the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of the whole Univerſe, except the <hi>Jews,</hi> lived
in groſs Ignorance as to Spiritual Affairs. For what was
commonly taught concerning the Gods, was for the moſt
part involved in Fables and moſt extravagant abſurdities
'Tis true,<note place="margin">The Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</note> ſome of the learned among them, have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to give ſome rational Account concerning the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Gods and the State of the Soul; but all this
in ſo imperfect and dubious a manner, that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
remained very uncertain in the whole matter.
They agreed almoſt all of them in this Point, that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
ought to apply it ſelf to the practice of Vertue,
but they did not propoſe any other Fruits, but the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Benefit which from thence did accrue to Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Society. For what the Poets did give out concerning
the rewards of Vertue and puniſhments of Vice after
Death, was by theſe who pretended to be the wiſeſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, look'd upon as Fables, invented to terrify
and keep in awe the common People. The reſt of the
People lived at random, and what the Heathens called
Religion, did not contain any Doctrine or certain Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
concerning the knowledge of Divine Matters. But
the greateſt part of their Religious Worſhip conſiſted in
Sacrifices and Ceremonies, which tended more to Sports
and Voluptuouſneſs, than to the Contemplation of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Things. Wherefore the Heathen Religion did nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Edify in this Life, nor afford any Hopes or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
at the time of Death.</p>
               <p>§ 3.<note place="margin">The Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Jewiſh Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</note> At that time the <hi>Jews</hi> were the only Nation
unto whom God had revealed the true Religion, which
could lead Mankind in the way of Salvation. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs,
there was a vaſt difference betwixt that and
the Chriſtian Religion, not only becauſe the Jewiſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
repreſented the Saviour of the World and the
Fountain of Salvation in Types and Promiſes; whereas
the Chriſtian Religion comprehends the reality and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment
of the ſame; but alſo becauſe the Jewiſh
Religion was cloathed with a great many and thoſe very
burthenſome Ceremonies: And ſome of them being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:65650:211"/>
to the natural inclination of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
they proved an obſtacle to the general recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that Religion by all Nations: This ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
part being like a Wall, whereby the <hi>Jews</hi> were
ſeparated from other Nations. 'Tis true, all other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
were not excluded from receiving Salvation through
the Belief in the Saviour of the World who was to come.
There were alſo ſome among the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were very
careful, and applied themſelves to the converſion of ſuch
as they kept Correſpondence withal. But it was not
decreed by God Almighty to ſend all over the Earth at
that time his Delegates or Apoſtles, inſtructed with
peculiar Gifts to call all Nations to unite themſelves
with the Jewiſh Church: And what was done by ſome
private Perſons in converting of Infidels, was of no great
conſequence in compariſon of the whole World. Beſides
this, the Jewiſh Nation being at that time the ſelected
People of God, adorned with great Prerogatives, and
having the poſſeſſion of the only Temple of God, was
grown ſo proud, that the <hi>Jews</hi> deſpiſed all other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
beſides themſelves. They being alſo obliged by
the Inſtitution of their Ceremonies, not to converſe too
familiarly upon ſeveral accounts with other Nations;
this occaſioned a mutual hatred betwixt the <hi>Jews</hi> and
them, which was a main obſtacle to the propogation of
the Jewiſh Religion. Neither could other Nations ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
digeſt this, that as often as they were to attend the
ſolemn and publick divine Service, they were firſt to
travel to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as if it were not in their power to
build a Temple equal to the other near home. Beſides
this, ſuch as received the Jewiſh Religion, were eſteemed
among them one degree below the Natives, which was
the reaſon why very few could reſolve for the Jewiſh
Religion's ſake, to be deſpiſed among them as Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners.</p>
               <p>§ 4.<note place="margin">The Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion is proper for all the world.</note> But the Chriſtian Religion is not only much
clearer, and alſo has other great Prerogatives above the
Jewiſh, which Conſideration we will leave to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines:
But it is alſo freed from thoſe Circumſtances
which were particular to the Jewiſh Religion, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
with all Qualifications requiſite for an univerſal
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:65650:211"/>
Religion; wherefore every one is obliged to receive and
embrace it, which deſerves particularly to be remarked,
that hereby we may inveſtigate and penetrate to the very
bottom, the propriety and genius of the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
For here is no particular place appointed by God
Almighty for performing in publick the Divine Service,
nor can any place claim a Prerogative before another,
ſo that no Nation henceforward has any occaſion to
make exception about the remoteneſs of the Temple;
but in all places you may lift up holy Hands unto him,
no Temple in the World having any particular promiſe
appertaining to it that God will ſooner hear your Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
in that than in another. No Nation has according
to the Chriſtian Religion, a precedency before another,
whereby one may claim a Prerogative above the other.
Here is no <hi>Jew,</hi> no <hi>Greek,</hi> no Bond nor Freeman, but
they are all one in Jeſus Chriſt. Here is no particular
Family or Tribe appointed by God for the publick ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration
of Divine Service as it was among the <hi>Jews;</hi>
but none is excluded here, provided he be endowed with
the neceſſary Qualifications. There is no Article in the
Chriſtian Religion, which forbids us to cultivate with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
either familiarity, or to render to one another the
Duties required from us by the Law of Nature.</p>
               <p>It is purely and by it ſelf conſidered,<note place="margin">Not contrary to Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</note> quite ſeparated
from all worldly Ends and Intereſts; yet is her Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
not in the leaſt repugnant to, or alters Civil So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
or Laws, as far as they are conſonant to the Law
of Nature, but it rather (tho' that is not her main in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention)
confirms the ſame. There is nothing to be
found in the Chriſtian Religion, which is deſtructive to
the Ends of Civil Society, or which hinders us from
living honeſtly, quietly and ſecurely under the protection
of Civil Magiſtrates, or from executing in every reſpect
the higheſt Civil Power according to the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
true Reaſon and the Neceſſities of the State, or
from adminiſtring all Offices and performing ſuch Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
without offending againſt the Rules of Chriſtianity,
as are requiſite for the maintaining a State eſtabliſhed
according to the Law of Nature. The Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
rather promotes all theſe things, expreſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
us ſtrictly to obſerve every Commandement
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:65650:212"/>
of the Law of Nature, and eſpecially thoſe where no
temporal puniſhment could be conveniently inflicted by
the Civil Conſtitutions, and to perform our Duty with
all Faithfulneſs and Zeal, as far as the ſame is conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with Honeſty and the Law of Nature.<note place="margin">No other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion or Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to it.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore not any Philoſophy or Religion whatſoever
is in this point to be compared with the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
which may be evident enough to all who will
make a true compariſon betwixt this and all the reſt.
And every body is therefore obliged as he hopes to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
for his Soul before God, not only to receive the
Chriſtian Religion, but alſo all Sovereigns and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
ought for the above-mentioned reaſons, and out
of a Duty belonging to their Office, to introduce and
maintain it. It is objected, that the Effects of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Religion are not ſo viſible, nor that the Life and
Converſation of a great many Chriſtians is not different
from that of the Heathens and <hi>Turks;</hi> it is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
that this Fault is not to be imputed to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian

               </p>
               <p>By the outward Direction or Government of the
Chriſtian Religion, we underſtand the Power of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting
certain Perſons for the exerciſing of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Divine Service, and the ſupreme Juriſdiction over
their Perſons; the ſupreme Adminiſtration and Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of ſuch Poſſeſſions as are dedicated to Religious
Services. The Power of making Laws for the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
maintenance of Religion, and the determining of
ſuch Differences as may ariſe among the Clergy under
what pretext ſoever it may be, and ſuch like. We
make a great difference betwixt the outward Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Religious Affairs and betwixt the Miniſtry of
the Church, which conſiſts in teaching, preaching and
adminiſtring of the Sacraments, all which, doubtleſs
belong only unto the Clergy. This Queſtion alſo is to be
underſtood of a Church already planted and eſtabliſhed,
not of a Church that is to be planted and eſtabliſhed.
For ſince the Chriſtian Religion owed its Original to
Divine Revelation, no humane Power could pretend to
have any Direction in the ſame, before this Doctrine
was throughly propoſed and taught by ſuch as had an
immediate Authority for ſo doing from God Almighty.
For when our Saviour after his Reſurrection did ſend
his Diſciples as Delegates and Apoſtles throughout the
whole World, to publiſh and introduce the Chriſtian
Religion, they received their Commiſſion for Preaching
every where not from the ſupreme Civil Magiſtrates, but
from God himſelf: wherefore Kings as well as the common
People were obliged to acknowledge them as immediate
Meſſengers of God, and obediently to ſubmit themſelves
to their Doctrine; and it would be next to an abſurdity
if any one ſhould pretend to a Direction in ſuch Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
as he was not inſtructed in before. From whence
ariſes this Conſequence, that what has been ſaid is to be
underſtood of ſuch Sovereigns or ſupreme Magiſtrates
as themſelves profeſs the true Chriſtian Religion, but
not of thoſe who are Infidels or erroneous in the chief
Articles of the Chriſtian Faith. For to commit the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of Religion to the latter, would be to make the
Wolf a Shepherd.</p>

§ 6.<note place="margin">The Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of this Queſtion according to the nature of Religion in general.</note> This Queſtion may be conſidered in three-ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
ways: Firſt, Whether this Neceſſity ariſes from
the Nature of each Religion in general? Or, Secondly,
Whether it ariſes from the Genius of the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
in particular? Or, Thirdly, Whether the ſame is
impoſed upon us by Divine Inſtitution or the particular
Command of God? That it ſhould proceed from the
natural Conſtitution of Religion in general, I am in no
ways able to find out. For Reaſon does not tell me,
that if I intend to ſerve God, I muſt of neceſſity make
a diviſion in the State, and thereby introduce two dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Powers independent of one another. The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
of the ſupreme Power, or ſuch a double<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed
Sovereignty in a State, adminiſters continual
Fuel, which at laſt breaks out into Jealouſies, Diviſions,
and inteſtine Commotions. On the other hand, it is in
no ways contrary to Reaſon to ſerve God, and at the
ſame time leave the ſupreme Direction of the outward
Matters belonging to Divine Service, to ſuch as have the
ſupreme Power in the State; if we ſuppoſe that thoſe
who have the ſupreme Power in their Hands, will not
impoſe any thing upon their Subjects which is falſe or
erroneous. It cannot be denied, that as every one is
bound by the Law of Nature to ſerve God; alſo is it
at the ſame time in his Power to perform the outward
Ceremonies in ſuch a manner as he believes they are
moſt pleaſing to God. But after Civil Societies were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted,
that ſame Power is thereby devolved to thoſe
who have the ſupreme Adminiſtration of Affairs in a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Society. And the moſt antient Fathers who did not
live under any regulated Government, exerciſed this
Power in their Families, which uſed to be transferred
to the Eldeſt Son, as <hi>haereditas eximia</hi> (or a hereditary
Prerogative) if the Brothers, after the Father's death,
did reſolve to live together in one Community. But
when afterwards Civil Societies were inſtituted, the ſame
Power was transferred to the Heads of theſe Societies,
and that out of a weighty Conſideration: For if every
one had been left to his free Choice in this Point, the
various and different Ceremonies in the Divine Service
muſt needs have introduced Confuſions, Diviſions and
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:65650:213"/>
inteſtine Commotions. And tho' by the <hi>Jews</hi> the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Miniſtry was hereditary to one particular Family,
yet the inſpection and ſupreme Direction was among
them reſerved to thoſe who had the ſupreme Civil Power
in their Hands, as the ſame is practiſed among moſt
other Nations.</p>
               <p>§ 7.<note place="margin">According to the Nature of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</note> Neither can any Reaſon be given why the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Religion is particularly ſo qualified, as to imply a
neceſſity, that the abovementioned Direction ſhould be
committed to any other than the ſupreme Magiſtrates,
tho' it contains ſomething more than is taught us by the
Light of Nature; ſince we ſuppoſe that by vertue of this
directive Power, they ought not to impoſe any thing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us contrary to the Word of God, nor be a hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
to the Prieſts in performing the Miniſtry accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Ordinances of God in the Holy Scriptures.
Neither can I find out any Reaſon, why the ſupreme
Magiſtrates ſhould want means duly to qualify them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
for this Adminiſtration or Direction. At leaſt,
they may let this Direction be exerciſed under their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
by ſuch as have acquired ſufficient abilities for
the ſame: In like manner as Sovereigns exerciſe their
Power by others in Civil Affairs, ſo the Power of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Laws was never denied to appertain to Sovereigns,
tho' it is certain that a Doctor or Profeſſor of the Law,
ought to be better inſtructed in them than is required
from a King. For both in theſe and other Matters, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereigns
ought to act with the Advice of ſuch as have
applied themſelves throughly to ſuch Affairs. And as it
is againſt the Intereſt of a Good and Wiſe King, if this
Power be not well exerciſed, ſo it is both his Duty and
Intereſt to ſee the adminiſtration of Religious Matters
well performed. For the more zealous and earneſt he is
in maintaining the Chriſtian Religion, the more obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
and better qualified his Subjects are likely to be,
and he may the better hope for the Bleſſing of God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty.
Neither can any thing be alledged why God
Almighty ſhould not as well afford his Aſſiſtance to a
Chriſtian and Orthodox Sovereign as to any other,
to perform this Government praiſe-worthily. Laſtly,
becauſe the Chriſtian Religion does not in any other
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:65650:214"/>
way derogate from Civil Ordinances and Laws, or from
the Power of Civil Magiſtrates as far as they are found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon the Law of Nature; ſo it is not to be ſuppoſed
that it diſagrees from this in this one Point, except a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive
Command of God can be alledged for the proof of
this Aſſertion. Whether there be ſuch a Command in
the Holy Scriptures, which expreſly forbids Sovereigns
to intermeddle with this Direction, and allows the ſame
to others in the higheſt degree of Sovereignty without
any dependency at all, thoſe are obliged to prove, who
endeavour to maintain this Aſſertion. In the mean while
we will inquire into the firſt Occaſion, and by what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
this Eccleſiaſtical Monarchy was eſtabliſhed in the
Weſtern Churches.</p>
               <p>§ 8.<note place="margin">Firſt propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</note> The Apoſtles therefore having after the Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of our Saviour, according to the Inſtructions recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from his own Mouth, begun to ſpread the Doctrine
of the Chriſtian Religion in far diſtant Countries, met
with great approbation in a ſhort time, both among the
<hi>Jews</hi> and other Nations; but more eſpecially among the
Common People, which having hitherto lived in groſs
Ignorance and in a miſerable Eſtate, very joyfully recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
this Doctrine, which enlightened and comforted
them in the miſeries of this Life. The Apoſtles alſo
themſelves, who were of mean Extraction and of no
great Authority, uſed to converſe moſt among this ſort
of People, as having the moſt eaſie acceſs to them as
their equals. But Men of Quality and Learning did
ſcare at firſt think it worth their while to apply
themſelves diligently to ſearch into the bottom of this
Religion, and very few of them would profeſs it.<note place="margin">The Methods of God in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhing the Chriſtian Religion.</note>
               </p>
               <p>If we may inquire into the Reaſons why it was the
pleaſure of the Wiſe God to chooſe this way of plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Chriſtian Religion, it ſeems very probable, that
God was not pleaſed to introduce the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
by the Power and Authority of Civil Magiſtrates,
nor by the Aſſiſtance of Learned Men, becauſe it might
not be deemed hereafter a State Trick, or a Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical
Speculation; but that whenever a due compariſon
might be made betwixt the ſlender beginnings and prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
encreaſe of this Religion, the World might from
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:65650:214"/>
thence conclude, that the whole was ſomething above
humane Power. And becauſe the Learned had proved
unſucceſsful with all their ſubtilties in their Diſcoveries
concerning Divine Matters; and that <hi>Socrates</hi> and ſome
others who were ſenſible of the vanity of the commonly
received Superſtitions, and had condemned them as ſuch,
had not been able to aboliſh thoſe, and in lieu thereof,
to introduce a better Religion; God Almighty was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to convince the World of the Vanity of worldly
Wiſdom, and to ſhew, how eaſie it was for him to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
this great Work by the means, even of poor
Fiſhermen. Beſides this, the Doctrine of the Apoſtles
ſeemed to be full of abſurdity to the Philoſophers and
Politicians, the ſame being founded upon, and begun
with Jeſus who was crucified. For it appeared very
ſtrange to them that the Apoſtles ſhould acknowledge
him for the Son of God and their Saviour, who was of
a hated and deſpiſed Nation, who having lived without
any great Splendour, or performed any great Heroic Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
had beſides this, not made himſelf Famous through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the World by long Study or Preaching, but had in
his younger years ſuffered a moſt infamous Death. And
this is the reaſon why the Jeſuites, when they teach the
Chriſtian Religion among the refined <hi>Chineſes,</hi> do not
begin with the Doctrine of the Paſſion of Chriſt; but
argue firſt with them out of the Principles of natural
Religion, and ſo at laſt come about to this Article of
the Chriſtian Faith. But whether theſe Fathers by this
method are likely to be more ſucceſsful than the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
I will not determine here.<note place="margin">Way the meaneſt firſt converted.</note> It may alſo be alledged,
that God was pleaſed to deliver the common People a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Heathens, before great Men, out of their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery
and darkneſs; becauſe the firſt were ſeduced by the
latter, and upheld in their Superſtition; for theſe, tho'
they were ſenſible of the Vanity of the Pagan Religion,
yet did not do their utmoſt endeavours to ſearch after a
better. Wherefore God Almighty by firſt drawing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the common People from Paganiſm, did under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the whole Structure, which was forced to fall of
it ſelf. Since the ſimplicity and credulity of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

§ 9.<note place="margin">Perſecution of the firſt Church.</note> The Chriſtian Doctrine therefore having been
moſt of all, at firſt, ſpread abroad among the common

of the true nature of this new Religion, or what was
the main end of it; ſince they ſaw the number of the
Chriſtians daily encreaſe, who all deſpiſed the Pagan

               <p>There were alſo not a few among the <hi>Romans,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Politick Reaſons of the <hi>Romans</hi> againſt it.</note> who
being averſe to any Innovation whatſoever, were of

among themſelves a certain Form of Eccleſiaſtical

who looked upon them as ſuch that were for ſetting up

in it, and ſo to divide the Empire, and at laſt make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
Maſters of it: Some alſo there were, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving,
that the more the numbers of the Chriſtians in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed,
the leſs frequented were the Temples of the
Heathens, and that the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire began to decline
and received great ſhocks; they perſwaded themſelves
that theſe Misfortunes befel them, becauſe thoſe Gods
through whoſe Aſſiſtance the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire arrived to
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:65650:215"/>
the Pinacle of its Grandeur, were now deſpiſed among
them, and therefore looked upon the Chriſtians as an
Atheiſtical Generation, endeavouring to over-turn the
very Foundations of Religion. And becauſe the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
refuſed to adore the Idols, notwithſtanding the
Emperours Commands, and ſuffered the moſt prodigious
Tortures and Death with conſtancy and even Joy; they
were treated like a perverſe and obſtinate ſort of People
by the <hi>Romans,</hi> who encreaſed their Cruelties to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
their Authority againſt them. But no ſufficient
Reaſons can be alledged for the juſtification of theſe
Perſecutions againſt the Chriſtians, which ought to be
conſidered no otherwiſe than unlawful Tyrannies, and
pernicious Abuſes of the ſupreme Civil Power. For their
Subjects had received this Religion according to the
expreſs Command of God, which could nor ought not
to be oppoſed by the Civil Power; the Magiſtrates as
well as the Subjects being obliged to receive it, except
they would groſly ſin againſt God Almighty. Neither
could their Ignorance ſerve them for an excuſe, ſince
this being a new Doctrine, it was their Duty to take
due information concerning the ſame, before they had
ſent the Innocent Chriſtians to Execution, only, becauſe
they refu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which ought not to oblige them to Obedience in this
Point. For no body ought to give Sentence of Death

the nature of the Crime, he is accuſed of.</p>
               <p>§.<note place="margin">The firſt Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</note> 10. And becauſe the Sovereigns did at firſt not
concern themſelves for the welfare of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
the Chriſtians therefore did without their aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
conſtitute a Miniſtry and the outward Church
Government among themſelves, which was maintained
among them as well as it could. For this is common
to all Societies which are inſtituted without the conſent
of the Supream Magiſtrate, that the Members thereof
are forced to agree among themſelves, which way to
order their Affairs beſt, and to Conſtitute certain Rules,
and Governours for the management of the Societies:
Elſe, according to the Rules of Policy, founded upon
the Law of Nature, the outward Government of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:65650:216"/>
belongs to the Sovereigns. But becauſe the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
would not perform their duty at that time,
the Chriſtians were obliged to Conſtitute Miniſters of
their own accord, who received their maintainance from
the Charity of good Chriſtians. And if any Errors
did ariſe, or other matters happened of ſuch conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
that the ſame could not be decided by one aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly,
ſeveral of theſe Aſſemblies uſed to conſult a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themſelves concerning the matter in queſtion, or
leave the determination to an Aſſembly of ſuch Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
as were next at hand. Tho it is certainly elſe
not to be allowed in a State, that private perſons ſhould
Conſtitute a Society among themſelves, conſiſting eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
of a conſiderable number; yet the Aſſemblies and
Synods of the antient Chriſtians are not therefore to be
deemed unlawful Meetings; ſince their only aim was
the exerciſe of their Religion, which being commanded
them by God, ought not to have been oppoſed by any
human Power. Neither is it reaſonable, that becauſe
the Magiſtrates were careleſs both of their Duty and
their own Salvation, the reſt alſo who had knowledge of
the true Religion, ſhould loſe the benefit of their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
againſt which no Civil Power ought to extend
its Juriſdiction. And, as it is allowable for every body
to defend himſelf with his own Strength and Weapons,
if Magiſtrates either can or will not protect him; ſo,
if a Sovereign will not do his Office as to the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of my Soul, I have as much more right to take
care of it without him, as the Soul is dearer to me than
the Body; and as by the exerciſe of the True Religion
my Fellow Subjects are leſs endangered, than by a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
defenſe of my own perſon; for no body by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
a Subject in a Civil Society, does thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
the priviledge of taking care for his Soul and
Body. Otherwiſe no doubt is to be made, that if it
had been the Will of God to introduce the Chriſtian
Religion by the Converſion of the Emperours and
Kings, theſe would with their Commands have aſſiſted
the Apoſtles in their Office, thrown down the Temples
of the Idols, aboliſhed the Pagan Idolatry, and would
according to the inſtruction of the Apoſtles, have
Conſtituted the outward Church Government, and
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:65650:216"/>
maintained it afterwards. For it is evident enough,
that this has been the manner of proceeding, as to this
point in other Countries, where the Chriſtian Religion
has been firſt introduced into the State, by the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of their Sovereigns.</p>
               <p>§.<note place="margin">What per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions ariſe thence.</note> 11. Nevertheleſs becauſe the firſt Chriſtians were
obliged, when the Magiſtrates failed in their Duty, to
regulate and Conſtitute a Church Government among
themſelves, this has occaſioned the riſe of ſeveral Errors,
which are of no ſmall conſequence. For, ſome have
from thence, endeavoured to make this inference, that
the people, as they ſtand in oppoſition to Sovereignty,
has an original and inherent Right to Elect Church Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters.
Tis true a Miniſter ought not to be obtruded
upon an Aſſembly againſt their will, eſpecially if they
have a lawful exception againſt him; becauſe he would
edifie but little in his Station; nevertheleſs, it is not
from hence to be concluded, that, becauſe ſome Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
have been obliged to provide themſelves with Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
when the Magiſtrates did neglect their Duty,
therefore the ſame Right is ever ſince Originally in the
People. For without this ſuppoſition an Aſſembly has
as little right to call and Conſtitute a Church Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
as to diſpoſe of Publick Offices and Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in the State. And if in ſome places the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
People or ſome others have ſuch a Right, it is
enjoyed either by connivance, or a conceſſion from the
Supreme Magiſtrate, whom we ſuppoſe to be a Chriſtian
and Orthodox. Some alſo have been endeavouring to
draw from thence this Concluſion, <hi>viz.</hi> That the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Church Government is ſeparate and diſtinct from
the Supreme Civil Power, and that it ought to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred
either by the whole Clergy, or elſe to depend
abſolutely on one ſingle perſon of the Clergy; ſo that,
according to this ſuppoſition, there muſt be in each
Chriſtian State two diſtinct Bodies independent of one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
one of which muſt be called the Eccleſiaſtick
<hi>(Eccleſia)</hi> the other the Politick State, <hi>(Civitas)</hi> and
each of them to be Sovereign in its Government.
But, tho this has been made uſe of ſometimes, when
Magiſtrates were quite negligent of their Duty, this
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:65650:217"/>
ought not to be drawn into Conſequence, when Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
are ready, duely to execute their Office. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
does it follow, that the ſame power which belonged
to the Apoſtles at that time when the Church was firſt to
be Eſtabliſhed, is now devolved to ſuch Church Miniſters
as have not an immediate Vocation from God in the Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
Church. For the Office of the Apoſtles was parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
and very different from the Church Miniſtry, as it is
exerciſed now adays; in like manner as the outward
Church Government is very different from the Miniſtry.
And as every lawful Church Miniſter is therefore not
immediately an Apoſtle, ſo the King is therefore not
immediately a Prieſt. And tho the Chriſtian Religion
ows its Original to God, and is above human reaſon;
nevertheleſs the Supreme Magiſtrate may be capable of
having the outward direction over it, with the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of ſuch perſons as are beſt verſed in ſuch Affairs.
And, from what has been ſaid, this Concluſion may be
made: <hi>viz.</hi> That the practice of the Primitive Church
as to this Point of the outward Church Government,
is not to be made a perpetual and univerſal Rule of the
Church Government in a State, which is under the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction
of a Chriſtian and Orthodox Magiſtrate. For
that practice was accommodated to the Circumſtances
of their Affairs then: But, where both the whole
People and the Sovereign have received the Chriſtian
Religion, the caſe is quite different, and implies not
any neceſſity that the State ſhould thereby become a
Body with two Heads.</p>

Emperours, who paſſed then but for Novices in the

in Eccleſiaſtical Matters, and to bridle the Authority of
the Biſhops and Clergy, that were very backward to part
with it. They were rather obliged to keep fair with
them, and to make uſe of their aſſiſtance to Eſtabliſh
themſelves in the Throne, ſince moſt of their Subjects
being then become Chriſtians paid a profound Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
to their Prieſts. The firſt Chriſtian Emperors alſo
made uſe of ſeveral Miniſters and Officers in their
Courts, who were as yet Pagans; wherefore it ſeem'd
not juſt, that Matters concerning the outward Church
Government, ſhould be determined by a Council, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
ſome Members were Heathens.</p>
               <p>This was the reaſon why the Vocation of Biſhops
and other Eccleſiaſticks was performed for the moſt
part according to the Cuſtoms introduced before.<note place="margin">Of making Biſhops.</note> And
not only ſuch Controverſies as aroſe concerning certain
Articles of Faith, but alſo of ſuch as had a relation to
the outward Order and Government of the Church,
and all other differences of moment among the Clergy
of the higher Rank were brought before the Councils,
or the Aſſemblies of the Clergy where theſe did pretend
alone to have the right to Preſide and to give their
Votes; Tho it is certain that not only the right of cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
them together belongs to the Sovereigns, who alſo
for a conſiderable time have exerciſed that power; but
alſo the direction and Preſidentſhip of ſuch Aſſemblies:<note place="margin">Of Preſiding in Councils.</note>
whatever matter is to be debated there, does at leaſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to the Prince, if their Decrees ſhall paſs afterwards
for, and have the power of a Law or a definitive
Sentence in the State. Indeed the Supreme Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,
no more than the Clergy can pretend to a right
of introducing new Articles of Faith, or of explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Scripture according to their own pleaſure: Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs,
the whole Duty of a Chriſtian being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the whole Scriptures, which God has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to be publiſhed for the benefit of Mankind,
and not to be committed, like Sibylline Oracles, to the
cuſtody of certain Prieſts; and ſince others as well
as the Clergy have the opportunity to comprehend the
Senſe of the Holy Scripture, it ſeems not at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to reaſon, that the Civil Magiſtrates ſhould have
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:65650:218"/>
at leaſt the Supreme direction of theſe Aſſemblies,
where matters concerning the different interpretations
of the Scripture are to be debated. From hence alſo
this benefit will accrue to the Publick, that thereby the
extravagant Heats and immoderate Paſſions, which are
commonly obvious in theſe Diſputes, may be mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,
matters may be debated with prudence, and not
ſtretched too high out of a fondneſs of contradicting,
nor that any one by malicious interpretation of his
Words and Opinion may fall under Slanders and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
or the Excommunication be thundred out with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
neceſſity againſt the innocent. And becauſe the
firſt Chriſtian Emperours did either neglect this their
Right, or had no opportunity of exerciſing it, this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned
great confuſion in ſome Councils:<note place="margin">Abuſes in the Council<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> From hence
alſo the Pope took an opportunity, after he had ſet
himſelf above the Weſtern Biſhops and Councils them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
to take upon him an Authority to decide Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies
even concerning Articles of Faith, to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
ſuch Canons or Eccleſiaſtical Laws in the Church,
as he thought moſt proper for his Intereſt and State,
and by pretending to the higheſt Juriſdiction to exempt
the Church from the Juriſdiction of the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates:
For when once this Opinion was eſtabliſhed,
that all theſe Matters did belong of right to the Clergy
only, without having any reſpect to the Civil Power,
the Pope did pretend to the ſame by the ſame Right,
by which he had ſet himſelf above the Clergy and the
whole Church.</p>
               <p>§.<note place="margin">Of the Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> 12. Beſides this it was the Cuſtom among the
Antient Chriſtians, that they very ſeldom pleaded their
Cauſes, according to the admonition of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> before
the Pagan Judges: But, in caſe of differences among
themſelves, they uſed to refer the ſame to the deciſion
of a Biſhop, that by their Conteſts they might not
give any occaſion of Scandal to the Heathens, ſince it
might ſeem unbecoming, that thoſe who made profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of deſpiſing worldly Riches, ſhould quarrel among
themſelves about the ſame. This Cuſtom as it was very
uſeful and praiſeworthy at that time; ſo becauſe it was
not Abrogated, but rather confirmed afterwards by the
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:65650:218"/>
Chriſtian Emperors, tho the Courts of Juſtice were
then Governed by Chriſtian Judges, the Biſhops after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
pretended to a formal Juriſdiction, which did
not only derogate from the Authority of Temporal
Judges, but alſo the Biſhops were thereby diverted from
performing ſuch Duties as properly belonged to their
Office. There was alſo another Cuſtom among the firſt
Chriſtians, that if a ſcruple aroſe concerning nearneſs of
Blood in Marriages,<note place="margin">Concerning Marriages.</note> they uſed to take the Opinion of
the Prieſts in this Caſe, and if any differences did ariſe
betwixt married People, it uſed to be referred to the
Arbitration of the Prieſts; who at the time alſo when
the Nuptials were Celebrated, uſed to give them their
Benediction and Pray with them. This, if in itſelf
conſidered, very good beginning, furniſh'd an occaſion
of great Abuſes afterwards, the Pope having from
hence taken a pretext to ſubject all Matrimonial Affairs,
concerning Divorces, Nullities of Marriages, Succeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Inheritances, and the like, of the greateſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence,
under his Juriſdiction, who, to render his
pretenſions the more plauſible, did make Marriage a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</p>
               <p>Beſides this,<note place="margin">Concerning Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note> the firſt Chriſtians were very deſirous to
recommend their Religion to the Heathens by a Holy
and Innocent Life, eſpecially ſince ſome ſort of Vices
were not puniſhable according to the Pagan Laws.
Wherefore in the Primitive Church, if any one had
given a Publick Scandal by his vicious Life, a certain
Church Penance was laid upon him, which at the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
did amount to this, that he was excluded from
the Communion of the Chriſtians. Which Cuſtom as
it is not unreaſonable, ſo it may be of good uſe in a
Chriſtian State, provided the Civil Magiſtrate have the
Supreme direction, and take care that ſuch a Cenſure
be not abuſed out of obſtinacy or private ends and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
Eſpecially ſince theſe Cenſures have had ſuch an
influence upon Civil Societies, that in the Eighth Age
no body would Converſe with any one that was Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated.
And this Power ought not to be given
to the abſolute diſpoſal of any one, except to the
Sovereign, if you will not divide the Sovereignty. But
in what manner the Popes have afterwards abuſed this
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:65650:219"/>
Cenſure, and extended it even to the Excommunication
of Emperors, Kings, and whole Commonwealths, and
by forbidding the Publick Exerciſe of Divine Service,
Abſolving the Subjects from their Allegiance, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing
their Kingdoms upon others, have forced them
to a compliance againſt their own Intereſt, is ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
known out of Hiſtory. Yet in the Eaſtern Empire
theſe Abuſes did not grow up to the ſame height, for
the Emperors at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> did at leaſt ſo far main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
their Authority againſt the Clergy, that they durſt
not pretend to dominere over them. Beſides that the
Eaſtern Biſhop wanted an opportunity to ſet themſelves
one above the other, becauſe the Biſhops at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi>
had no other Prerogative allowed him, but Precedency
of Rank above the others without his Dioceſs, but not
any Juriſdiction.</p>
               <p>§.<note place="margin">The Origin of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Popes.</note> 14. But in the Weſtern parts the Church after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
took quite another Face, ſince the Biſhop of
<hi>Rome</hi> had projected a peculiar ſort of a Monarchy,
which by degrees he brought to perfection, and has not
had its parallel ever ſince the memory of mankind, it
being founded upon quite other Principles, and upheld
by very different means from other States. The more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
this Monarchy has had for ſeveral hundred years
together upon the States and Affairs of <hi>Europe,</hi> and has
been maintained with great Zeal by one, and oppoſed by
the other party, the more it will be worth our while, to
dive into the firſt Origin and Conſtitution of it, and to
alledge ſome reaſon, why in the laſt Age this Monarchy
was reduced to a tottering condition, but has recolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
its vigour in ours. From whence a wiſe Man alſo
may be able to judge what ſucceſs may be hoped for
from the Projects of thoſe, who are for reconciling the
differences betwixt the Proteſtants and Papiſts. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
it may be ſaid, that towards the increaſe of this
Monarchy, ſo pernicious to the Supreme Civil Power,
has not a little contributed, tho afar off, the Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and ignorance,<note place="margin">Barbarity and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to it.</note> which, after the decay of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Empire, did ſpread itſelf over the Weſtern parts.
For bad Wares are beſt vented in the dark, or at leaſt
by a dim light: And an ignorant perſon is ſooner pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:65650:219"/>
upon to believe ridiculous Stories than a wiſe
Man verſed in all ſorts of Sciences.</p>
               <p>There were ſeveral cauſes,<note place="margin">The Cauſes of this igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</note> which promoted this bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity,
which did degenerate afterwards into the worſt
ſort of pedantry, (whereas the former Age had been
ſufficiently inſtructed with learned Men.) One of the
principal ones was the Invaſion made upon the Weſtern
Provinces of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire by thoſe Nations, who
tho ſufficiently Brave, were ignorant of Learning; which
occaſioned for one or two Ages after great Changes in
the Government, bloody Wars, horrible diſorders, and
all ſorts of miſeries in the Empire. And Learning being
the product of Peace and Proſperity, it is little regarded
in times of War, or during the Diſtractions of a State;
ſince then there is but little leiſure time given for the
uſe of Books. The Schools are commonly deſtroyed,
and the Teachers obliged to make ſhift, where beſt they
can, a Muſquet being at ſuch times of more uſe than
a School Satchel. The School-Maſters eſpecially are
forced to ſhut up Shop at ſuch times, if the victorious
Enemy is ignorant of Learning, and makes no account
of Books. There are alſo ſome who affirm that the
Clergy was acceſſary to this barbariſm. For, becauſe
the Philoſophers had under the Reigns of the Pagan
Emperours proved very miſchievous to them, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
under the Chriſtian Emperours continued to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
themſelves againſt the Clergymen eſpecially, theſe
had conceived ſuch a hatred againſt Philoſophy, and
againſt all ſuch as profeſſed it, that they not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
the ſame into their Auditors, but alſo removed
out of the Schools and took from the young Students,
who were committed to their care, the Pagan Authors,
under pretence that they might otherwiſe be again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with the erroneous Principles of the Pagans, and
that it could not but be ſinful for Chriſtians to read ſuch
Books as were filled every where with the names of the
Pagan-Idols, which they would not have as much as
named by Chriſtians. They related a Story concerning
S. <hi>Hierom</hi> how that he was whipped in a Viſion with
Rods,<note place="margin">S. <hi>Hierom</hi>'s Dream.</note> becauſe he uſed frequently to Read the Works of
<hi>Cicero;</hi> and about the year 400. after the Birth of our
Saviour; the Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> forbid the Biſhops
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:65650:220"/>
the reading of Pagan Authors. And Learning being
in thoſe miſerable times become almoſt uſeleſs except
to thoſe who intended to profeſs Divinity, and the
remnants of Learning being lodged therefore among
the Clergy, the main Inſtitution in the Schools was
only directed for that Purpoſe, and the reſt of the
young Diſciples were not very forward to dive much
into the ſecrets of Antient Learning. And that Ignorance
and Barbariſm have greatly promoted the eſtabliſhment
of Popery is evident enough to thoſe, who will conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that in a learned Age thoſe Decretals which are
aſcribed to the firſt Popes, could never have paſſed
Muſter; which nevertheleſs have been made uſe of to
perſuade the People that the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> have
exerciſed an Authority from the very beginning of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,
to preſcribe Laws ot the Chriſtian World.</p>
               <p>But when afterwards the times proved more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
in <hi>Europe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Pedan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into the Schools.</note> and the Popes perceived that ſome
among the moſt conſiderable Nations of <hi>Europe</hi> could
not be longer kept in a groſs Ignorance, they introduced
into the Schools, over which they had aſſumed the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Direction, the moſt miſerable ſort of Pedantry,
which is alſo maintained by their Creatures with great
earneſtneſs in their Schools to this very day. But above
all the reſt, it ſeems that the ignorance of the true
Principles of Policy, has had a main ſtroke in laying
the Foundation of Popery, for want of which they
were not then duely inſtructed concerning the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Nature, and Perfection of the Supreme Civil
Power, and that no State could be eſteemed well Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed,
where the Supreme Civil Power was either di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
or diminiſhed.<note place="margin">

Power, whereby they had enamoured the People
with an Ariſtocratical or Democratical ſort of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but infuſed into them ſuch a hatred againſt
Monarchy, that it was a common Maxim among them,
that the more they could incr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ch upon the Authority
of the Prince, the more it muſt turn to the advantage
of the State. In this pernicious Opinion a great many
were confirmed by the Tyrannical proceedings of the
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:65650:220"/>
Emperours, who were mortally hated by moſt of their
Subjects. It was therefore no great wonder, that at
the time of this general Ignorance the knowledge of
true Policy was not taught among the Chriſtian Clergy,
ſince it ſeem'd to them to be repugnant to their Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
From hence it was, that, when by degrees the
Foundation of the Eccleſiaſtical Sovereignty was laid,
few did throughly underſtand of what Conſequence
this undertaking was, and how prejudicial it would
prove to the Supreme Civil Power, when ever it could
be brought to perfection. And we ſee even to this day,
that in thoſe Schools, which are under the care of the
Popiſh Clergy, the Principles of true Policy are either
neglected, or at leaſt ſo disfigured that they may not
be hurtful to the Authority of the Popes, but rather
ſerve to ſupport it.</p>
               <p>§.<note place="margin">Why <hi>Rome</hi> was made the place of Reſidence of the Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy.</note> 15. But the chief reaſon, why <hi>Rome</hi> was choſen
for the place of Reſidence of the Eccleſiaſtical Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,
ſeems to be, that this City had a particular Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
of being the Capital City of the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
where the Chriſtian Religion at firſt had its r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſe
and increaſe. For what is related concerning S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s
Chair is nothing but a vain pretence, which may be
eaſily ſeen from thence, that afterwards the Biſhop of
<hi>Conſtantinople</hi> had the next place aſſigned him after the
Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> only becauſe that City was then the
place of Reſidence of the Emperour, and new <hi>Rome.</hi>
And when afterwards the Weſtern <hi>Roman</hi> Empire was
come to decay, and the City of <hi>Rome</hi> had loſt its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
luſtre, the Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> diſputed the
precedency with the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhop. After the Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions,
which the Chriſtians had endured under the
Pagan Emperours, were ceaſed, and they afterwards
enjoyed their full Liberty, the Clergy began, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of introducing a wholeſome Order in the Church
to Eſtabliſh a particular ſort of Government or Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,
the Biſhops having then begun to claim a great
Prerogative above the Prieſts. The Biſhops alſo were
made ſubordinate to one another, ſo that commonly
the inſpection over the Biſhops in a certain Province
was committed to the Biſhop of the Capital City of the
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:65650:221"/>
ſame Province,<note place="margin">Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans.</note> who being then called Metropolitans,
did afterwards, <hi>viz.</hi> about the Eighth Century moſt of
them aſſume the name of Archbiſhops. Four of them
were moſt eminent above all the reſt, <hi>viz.</hi> The Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops
of <hi>Rome,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Patriarchs.</note> 
                  <hi>Conſtantinople, Antioch</hi> and <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi>
theſe being then the four principal Cities of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Empire; and the Archbiſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was
added to their number, becauſe of the Antient Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of that City. And tho the Emperor <hi>Phocas,</hi> out
of a ſpite againſt the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> who
who would not approve of the Murther committed
upon <hi>Mauritius,</hi> did grant the precedency to <hi>Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi>
III. the then Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who did thereupon
take upon him the Title of Oecumenical Biſhop; yet
this Prerogative did not extend any further than to bare
Precedency, nor did imply any Power or Juriſdiction
over the reſt, which the other Patriarchs never acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged.
And a conſiderable time before, when the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Rome</hi> pretended to put his Commands upon the
Biſhops of <hi>Africa,</hi> and for that purpoſe alledged a
Canon of the Council of <hi>Oliva,</hi> which was falſified,
they ſent him back a very ſmart Anſwer.</p>
               <p>And in the whole buſineſs there is no footſteps of a
Divine Inſtitution to be met withal,<note place="margin">Of the Popes Power.</note> the ſame being
purely Human, nor can any reaſon be alledged, why the
Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> poſſeſſes the firſt Rank, other than why
he of <hi>Antioch</hi> has the third among them. And becauſe
one State cannot preſcribe Laws to another, therefore
if any Prerogatives have been granted to the Biſhop of
<hi>Rome</hi> by the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors, or the Antient Councils,
(which were nothing formerly but an Aſſembly of the
Clergy of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire,) the ſame do not oblige
any other State, nor can they extend beyond the
Bounds and Juriſdiction of the antient <hi>Roman</hi> Empire.
But if we put the Caſe that ſome Chriſtian Princes or
States have afterwards allowed to the Pope a certain
power over the Church in their Dominions, this was
either done becauſe they either underſtood not the true
nature of this Power, or becauſe they were deceived by
the Popes. In the firſt Caſe the ſame is to be deemed
nothing elſe but a Treaty or Alliance with the Pope,
the better to Adminiſter the Church Affairs with the
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:65650:221"/>
Pope's Direction. Such a Treaty or Alliance as it Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally
proceeds from the Conſent of that State; ſo
the ſame may be Annulled again, in the ſame manner
as other Alliances are, whenever it proves prejudicial
to the State, or the Pope begins to abuſe the Authority
granted him by the State. But if the Pope has either
by Fraud or Impoſition obtained his Power over other
States, theſe ſo miſguided and thus ſurpriſed States,
have a right, as ſoon as they have diſcovered the Fraud,
and are convinced of their Error, to ſhake off ſuch an
unjuſt Uſurpation, and beſides may demand ſatisfaction
for the dammages ſuſtained by theſe impoſtures.</p>
               <p>§.<note place="margin">Further In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the Eccleſiaſtical Sovereignty.</note> 16. Neither could the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> extend
their Power over the Weſtern parts all at once, but it
was introduced from time to time, by degrees and by
various Artifices, and under ſeveral pretences. For,
when they had once faſtened their Paws, they did not
retreat till they had obtained their pretenſions, tho they
were ſeveral times denied admittance. They did very
wiſely take hold of that opportunity which preſented
itſelf, and was the chiefeſt of all in my jugdment,
when the Emperors began to chooſe other places of
Reſidence beſides <hi>Rome,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">What con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to it.</note> ſince by their conſtant preſence
there they might eaſily have kept under the ambitious
deſigns of the Biſhops. For the Biſhops of <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi>
who queſtionleſs were no leſs proud and ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
than thoſe of <hi>Rome,</hi> could never gain this Point.
The next thing which mainly contributed to this
Power, was, that afterwards the Weſtern Empire was
divided into ſeveral new Kingdoms, erected by bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
and Pagan Nations; and theſe having been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
to the Chriſtian Faith with the aſſiſtance of the
<hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, thought themſelves obliged to pay to
her a profound reſpect, and to honor her as the moſt
antient and the principal of the Weſtern parts.</p>
               <p>To recite all the particulars here is not for our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,<note place="margin">The Popes Confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops.</note>
it will be ſufficient to touch upon ſome of the
main Points: it is therefore to be remarked, that ſince
the Fifth Century the Biſhops which lived on this ſide
of the <hi>Alpes</hi> uſed to go to <hi>Rome</hi> to viſit the Sepulchres
of S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi> out of a Superſtition or a Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:65650:222"/>
very common in thoſe days, or becauſe they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
intended to teſtifie their firm adherency to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Faith. This voluntary Devotion was afterwards by
degrees changed into a neceſſity, and ſuch as neglected
it, uſed to receive ſevere rebukes. From hence it was eaſie
for the Popes afterwards to pretend that the Biſhops
ought to receive their Confirmation from <hi>Rome.</hi> Some
other Biſhops and Churches alſo, that were Novices in
compariſon of the antient <hi>Roman</hi> Church uſed to refer
themſelves to, and ask the advice of the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> concerning ſome Matters of great Conſequence,
and the true uſe and interpretation of the Canons. And
when they once perceived at <hi>Rome</hi> that their anſwers
were taken as deciſions, they began to ſend their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
before they were demanded, under pretence that
<hi>Rome</hi> being the firſt Seat of the Chriſtian Biſhops it
ought to take effectual care that the Canons and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical
Laws were duely put in Execution. Under
the ſame pretence they made themſelves immediate
Judges over the Differences ariſen betwixt the Biſhops,
and incroaching upon the Right and Juriſdiction of the
Metropolitans, uſed to depoſe ſuch Biſhops, as accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their Opinion had not a right Ordination; or
ſuch as were accuſed of ſome enormous Crimes, they
obliged to appear before them at <hi>Rome</hi> to defend their
Cauſe. And if there were ſome that pretended to
a Prerogative, or to obtain an Exemption from the
Canons, they did Travel to <hi>Rome,</hi> where they were
kindly received and incouraged in their demands, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the Staple of Diſpenſations and Favours to be
granted, was eſtabliſh'd at <hi>Rome:</hi> And if any one had
loſt his Cauſe before the ordinary Judge, he uſed to
Appeal to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he was kindly received and
incouraged. The <hi>French</hi> Hiſtorians relate, that, becauſe
the Emperor <hi>Henry</hi> had made the City of <hi>Arles</hi> the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital
City over ſeven Provinces, the Pope Conſtituted
the Archbiſhop of the ſaid City his Vicar in <hi>France,</hi>
for fear leſt the ſaid Archbiſhop might by degrees at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
to make himſelf Patriarch of <hi>France.</hi> And this
Archbiſhop choſe rather to have the inſpection, tho pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cariouſly,

to the Intereſt of the <hi>Roman</hi> Chair, from whence
he received the Epiſcopal Pall, and the Title of Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop
of <hi>Mayence,</hi> having alſo been Conſtituted by

Councils, and to Conſtitute Biſhops in thoſe places

Nations, and to <hi>Charles Martel,</hi> the then Grand Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of <hi>France,</hi> that he ſhould take him into his prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
which he very willingly did. And when after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his Son <hi>Carlomannus</hi> ſhewed a great forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to have the Church Diſcipline regulated, <hi>Boniface</hi>
was very willing to take upon him this Office to the
great advantage of the <hi>Roman</hi> Chair. He alſo at the
requeſt of <hi>Carlomannus</hi> call'd a Council in <hi>Germany,</hi>
and at the requeſt of <hi>Pepin</hi> ſeveral Synods in <hi>France,</hi>
where <hi>Boniface</hi> always was Preſident in the quality of
Legat of the <hi>Roman</hi> Chair. In the firſt Council the
Clergy ſigned a certain Confeſſion of Faith, whereby
they obliged themſelves, not only to maintain the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Faith, but alſo to remain in conſtant Union
with the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and to be obedient to the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours
of S. <hi>Peter.</hi> This <hi>Boniface</hi> alſo was the firſt,
who put it upon the Biſhops of <hi>Germany</hi> to receive the
Epiſcopal Pall from the Pope, who ſent it to the Biſhops
of <hi>France</hi> without their requeſt, thereby to unite them
with the <hi>Roman</hi> Chair. And when once theſe Ornaments
were become cuſtomary amongſt them, they were put
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:65650:223"/>
upon them afterwards as of abſolute Neceſſity, and
the Epiſcopal Function was forbidden to be exerciſed
by them before they had received theſe Ornaments.</p>
               <p>Beſides this,<note place="margin">Annals.</note> the Popes aſſumed to themſelves an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of giving leave to the Biſhops to remove from
one Epiſcopal See to another, and obliged all the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern
Biſhops to receive their Confirmation from <hi>Rome,</hi>
for which they were obliged to pay a certain Summ of
Money as an acknowledgement, which was ſince con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
to Annals. The Popes alſo by making void the
Deciſions of the provincial Synods or Aſſemblies, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw
their Authority; wherefore when every body
plainly perceived that the Decrees of theſe Aſſemblies
could produce no other Effects but to be continually an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulled
by the Popes, without as much as hearkening to
any Reaſons, they were by degrees quite aboliſhed.
Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> VII. alſo forced the Biſhops to ſwear an
Oath of Fealty to the Pope, and by a Decree forbid
that none ſhould dare to condemn any one that had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed
to the Pope. They were alſo not forgetful in
ſending Legates or Nuncios to all places, whoſe buſineſs
was, to exerciſe in the name of the Pope the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
which had formerly belonged to the Biſhops,
Metropolitans and Provincial Aſſemblies.</p>
               <p>§ 17.<note place="margin">Riches of the Church.</note> This growing Eccleſiaſtical Sovereignty was the
more prejudicial to the ſupreme Civil Power, the more
the Church daily increaſed both in Numbers and Riches.
The firſt Foundation of the Wealth of the Church was
laid by the Liberality and Charity of Princes and other
great Men, who were of Opinion, that they did a very
agreeable Service to God Almighty if they were liberal
and bounteous towards his Church and the Clergy.
And after they had once perſwaded the People, that by
doing good Works, among which the Gifts and Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
for Pious uſes had the firſt place they could and
muſt deſerve Heaven from God Almighty; this Libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
was increaſed to a high degree. Yet the voluntary
Contributions of the People not being able to ſatisfy
the avarice of the Clergy, which increaſed together
with their Riches, other ways and artifices were found
out to empty the Peoples Purſes, and a great many unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:65650:223"/>
Inſtitutions introduced which were to be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed
for Money. Then it was that the ſaying of Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
for the living and the dead, Purgatory, Indulgences,
Diſpenſations, Pilgrimages, Jubilees, and the like, were
introduced without meaſure. They had beſides this, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
a watchful Eye over ſuch as were at the point of
death, ſince they knew that Men were commonly not
ſo addicted at that time to their worldly Riches, which
they were elſe to leave to their Heirs who often rejoiced
at their Death: Nay, they were not aſhamed to make
a profeſſion of begging.</p>
               <p>Among other Tricks,<note place="margin">The Policies of the Popes in the Croi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſade.</note> the Popes did in the Eleventh
and the following Century turn the Croiſadoes to their
great Advantage. For in theſe expeditions after the
People had once received the Sign of the Croſs to aſſiſt
in the recovery of the Holy Land, the Popes pretended
to the ſupreme Command and Direction; they took the
Perſons and Eſtates of ſuch as had received the Croſs
under their particular Protection, exempting them
thereby from the Civil Juriſdiction both in Civil and
criminal Cauſes, and rendring their Diſpenſations and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences
more frequent and flouriſhing than before;
the Pope's Legates did diſpoſe of ſuch Alms, Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Legacies as were given for that purpoſe, and
under the ſame pretext received the Tenths from the
Clergy; nay, even pretended to put their Commands
upon Princes to receive the Croſs themſelves. Theſe
they imployed afterwards againſt ſuch as were declared
by them Sciſmaticks or Hereticks, whoſe poſſeſſions
they uſed to confiſcate and beſtow upon thoſe who had
proved ſerviceable to them, without asking the Advice
of the Sovereign, who durſt not but inveſt theſe with
thoſe Countries that were preſented to them by ſo high

Nuns ſettled themſelves all over Chriſtendom. This
ſort of People began firſt to appear in the World at the
time of the great Perſecutions, but in the Fourth and
following Centuries did multiply their numbers to a
prodigious degree. In the beginning they lived upon
what they could get by their Handy-work; a great
many uſed to give their Goods to the Poor, tho' volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily,
and lived under the Direction of the Biſhops, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to a Diſcipline preſcribed in the Canons. In
the Seventh Century eſpecially, Fryars and Nuns were
much in vogue in thoſe Weſtern Parts, which were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
where filled up with Monaſteries and Nunneries
built by the encouragement of Princes and other great
Men that endowed them with great Revenues. But
when the Charity and Liberality of the People ſeemed
almoſt to be exhauſted by the great Charges beſtowed
upon ſo many rich Monaſteries, and yet there were not
enough to contain all ſuch as were deſirous to enter into
this ſort of Life; at laſt in the Thirteenth Century the
Order of the Mendicant-Fryars was erected:<note place="margin">Mendicants.</note> Theſe
made a great ſhew of Holineſs, becauſe they would not
be taken for ſuch as were forward to chooſe a Monaſtick
Life to live in plenty, but for ſuch as had taken a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
to bid farewel to all the Pleaſures of this World,
and at the beſt,<note place="margin">The Motives to embrace this manner of Life.</note> maintain themſelves by Alms. A great
many have embraced this ſevere Order, out of an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of a particular Holineſs and Merit, which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
did belong to this Order, or rather an Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick
Ambition; the Pride of Mankind being ſo great
and natural to ſome, that they did not think the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of God ſufficient, but rather would receive Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:65650:224"/>
from God Almighty as a deſert than as a gift, and
were ambitious of having a preference before others,
even in the other Life. Some there are who embrace a
Monaſtick Life out of deſperation, ſome out of lazineſs.
A great many are by their Parents and Relations ſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Monaſtery out of Superſtition or Poverty, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the ruin of a Family by the diviſion of the Eſtate
among a great many Children. And out of theſe Fryars
the Pope has choſen his Regiment of Guards, which he
lays in Garriſon not only to plague the Laiety, but alſo to
curb the Biſhops and the reſt of the Clergy. It was for this
reaſon that the Pope did uphold the Fryars with ſo much
zeal againſt the Biſhops, in the Tenth Century, eſpecially,
when they withdrawing themſelves from the Juriſdictions
of the Biſhops, did ſubmit themſelves to the immediate Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Pope. And the Popes know ſo well how to
handle them, that tho' there are great Jealouſies on foot
betwixt their ſeveral Orders, as for example, betwixt
the Franciſcans and Dominicans, they nevertheleſs keep
ſo even a ballance betwixt them, and ſo equally diſpoſe
of their Favours towards them, that one Order may not
oppreſs another, or that any of them may have any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to complain of the Pope's partiality.</p>
               <p>Theſe Fryars alſo uſed to interfere often with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Clergy,<note place="margin">Prejudicial to the regular Clergy.</note> as pretending to a great ſhare in the Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
and Burials of the richer ſort, to the direction of
Conſciences and the adminiſtration of the Sacraments.
From hence did ariſe a continual envy and hatred from
the Biſhops and regular Clergy againſt theſe Fryars,
who being upheld by the Pope's Favour, were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
at their anger. And therefore whenever any
Biſhop attempted any thing againſt the Pope's Authority,
theſe Fryars with their clamour and noiſe purſued him
every where like ſo many Hounds, and rendred him
odious to the common People, amongſt whom they were
in great veneration, through their outward appearance
of Holineſs; and from thence it came to paſs, that the
Biſhops who oppoſed the Pope's Authority never could
make a great Party among the common People. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
this, the Fryars always kept a watchful Eye over
the actions of the Biſhops, giving continual advices con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
them to their Generals reſiding at <hi>Rom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="398" facs="tcp:65650:225"/>
by the Popes were enabled to oppoſe timely any deſign
intended againſt their Authority. And theſe Fryars
proved the main obſtacle, why the Biſhops could not ſo
effectually oppoſe the Pope's Authority which he aſſumed
over them, ſo that being deſtitute of means to help
themſelves, they were forced to follow the current. Tho'
it is alſo certain, that ſome of them were very well ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with it, as believing that they did participate of the
Grandeur of their ſupreme Head, and that thereby
they ſhould be exempted from the Juriſdiction of the
Civil Magiſtrates, which was more dreadful to them than
a foreign Juriſdiction exerciſed by thoſe of their own
Order, from whom they had all the reaſon to expect
more Favour. Nevertheleſs it is alſo undeniable, that a
great many Biſhops, eſpecially among thoſe on this ſide the
<hi>Alps</hi> bear a grudge to the Pope's Authority to this very
day, which evidently appeared at the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi>
where the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Biſhops did inſiſt very
cloſely upon this Point, that it might be decided, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Biſhops are not obliged to Reſidence by the Law of
God, which is alſo the Opinion of the <hi>Janſeniſts</hi> (as they
are called) in <hi>France</hi> and the <hi>Netherlands.</hi> The more
refined ſort did eaſily perceive what their Intention was
by making this Propoſition. For if God had commanded
them this, it muſt alſo be a conſequence that he had
given them means and inſtructed them with ſufficient
Power <hi>(qui dat jus ad finem, dat jus ad media)</hi> and
that therefore they were not obliged to go to <hi>Rome</hi> firſt,
and to purchaſe an Authority to exerciſe their Function.
The Pope met with great Difficulties before he could
ſurmount this obſtacle at the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is very likely that this will be the laſt Council,
ſince the Pope will ſcarce hereafter put his Grandeur to
the hazard and the deciſion of ſuch an Aſſembly; which
alſo ſeems now to be of no further uſe, ſince the Jeſuits
and ſome others have taught that the Pope is infallible
and above Councils, from whom they ought to receive
a confirmation, and a binding or obliging Power. But
let it be as it will, the Biſhops are for their own ſakes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
not to withdraw themſelves from the Popes ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
ſince thereby they would fall under the Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Civil Power, and would be obliged to ſeek
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:65650:225"/>
for Protection from their Sovereigns, who muſt be Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Princes, if they ſhould protect them againſt the
Pope; wherefore they are now forced to chooſe the leaſt
of two Evils.</p>
               <p>§ 19.<note place="margin">How the Church was freed from all Power over it.</note> Tho' the Church was never ſo abounding in
Riches and in great numbers of Eccleſiaſticks, yet was
it abſolutely neceſſary, that the Pope if the intended to
eſtabliſh an Eccleſiaſtical Monarchy, ſhould not be in
any ways dependent on any Temporal Prince; and
that he ſhould reſide in a place which was free from all
ſubjection to any Civil Power but himſelf; that he alſo
ſhould be poſſeſſed of ſuch an Eſtate, as might be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to maintain his Grandeur, and not to be liable to
be taken away from him upon any pretence whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever;
where alſo his adherents might find a ſafe retreat
whenever they ſhould be purſued by the Civil Power.
To eſtabliſh this was a buſineſs of a conſiderable time
and labour, neither could it be effected without great
oppoſition, and that by a great many Artifices and kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh
Tricks. And it is certain that as long as there was
an Emperour in the Weſtern Empire, and as long as the
Empire of the <hi>Goths</hi> laſted in <hi>Italy,</hi> the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi>
could not ſo much as think of this Greatneſs.<note place="margin">How the Popes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from their ſubj<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the Emperours.</note> But this
having been deſtroyed under the Emperour <hi>Juſtinian,</hi>
and <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> made a Province of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
then it was that the Popes took their opportunity
to exempt themſelves from the Juriſdiction of theſe Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours,
whoſe Authority was mightily decayed in <hi>Italy,</hi>
partly by the ill management of their Governours at <hi>Raven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
partly by their own weakneſs and want of Strength;
for the <hi>Lombards</hi> were Maſters in <hi>Italy,</hi> and in the times
of <hi>Juſtinian</hi> II. one Emperour was for ruining the other.
Beſides this, ſome of theſe Emperours were againſt the
adoring of Images, and <hi>Leo Iſaurus</hi> quite ejected them
out of the Churches, becauſe this adoration was wholly
degenerated into Idolatry, and as to the outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
the Saints were more regarded than God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
This undertaking was very vehemently oppoſed
by Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> II. who ſtood up for the Images, partly
becauſe the <hi>Roman</hi> Chair found this Superſtition very
advantageous; partly becauſe the Pope took it very ill
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:65650:226"/>
that the Emperour ſhould undertake a Reformation in
Matters of Religion without his Knowledge and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
and that at that time when he was buſie to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce
the Eccleſiaſtical Monarchy in the Weſtern
parts; partly alſo, becauſe he thought to have met with
an opportunity to withdraw himſelf from the Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Emperours. The better to obtain
his Aim, he ſtirred up the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Italians,</hi> who hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
had been under the Obedience of the Emperours,
to refuſe to pay them Tribute; and the Governour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding
at <hi>Ravenna,</hi> endeavouring to maintain the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour's
Right, was ſlain in a Tumult. Whereby the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction
and Power of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Emperours was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed
in thoſe parts of <hi>Italy,</hi> and theſe Countries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan

                  </note> By theſe means the Pope had freed himſelf from

not long after he was threatened by another Enemy, who
being nearer at hand, was likely to prove more trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
to him than formerly the Emperours who lived
at ſo conſiderable a diſtance. For the Kings of the
<hi>Longobards</hi> endeavoured firſt to make themſelves Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of thoſe parts which were fallen off from the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,
and afterwards of all <hi>Italy.</hi> They had already

was able to ſtop their Victories. The Popes were then
hard put to it, and knew not where to ſeek for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
except of the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> who at firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to finiſh theſe Differences by an amicable
Compoſition, but the <hi>Longobards</hi> not being willing to
reſt ſatisfied therewith, they reſolved by force of Arms to
maintain the <hi>Italian</hi> Affairs. They were eaſily prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon to undertake this Buſineſs, not only becauſe
Pope <hi>Zachary</hi> had approved of the Proceedings of <hi>Pepin,</hi>
who having abdicated the lawful King, was from a
Grand-Marſhal become King of <hi>France;</hi> but alſo they
had thereby an opportunity offered them to make Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts
in <hi>Italy,</hi> whereof the <hi>French</hi> Nation has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
very ambitious. <hi>Pepin</hi> and afterwards <hi>Charles</hi> the
Great, having been ſo Fortunate in their Wars againſt
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:65650:226"/>
the <hi>Longobards,</hi> as to Conquer their whole Kingdom;
they gave to the Papal Chair all that Tract of Land
which had been formerly under the Juriſdiction of the
<hi>Grecian</hi> Governours. There are ſome who are of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that to obtain this Gift, the Pope made uſe of the
fictitious Donation of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, which in
thoſe barbarous times was eaſily impoſed upon the
ignorant World. Beſides this, the <hi>French</hi> Kings had
great Obligations to the Pope for the above-mentioned
reaſon, and were alſo fond of acquiring the name of
pious Princes, by beſtowing liberal Preſents out of other
Mens Poſſeſſions. For it was in thoſe Days a common
Cuſtom, that Men of all degrees made it their Buſineſs
to out-do one another in Liberality towards the Clergy.
Nay, the Princes uſed to grant them theſe Poſſeſſions
without any incumbrances, that thereby the Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks
might be ſure to enjoy free poſſeſſion of what they
had beſtowed upon them. Theſe extravagant Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
were none of the leaſt Cauſes why the Clergy after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
did labour with ſo much vehemency to withdraw
themſelves from the Juriſdiction of the Civil Magiſtrates,
as fearing that theſe extravagant Donations and Grants
might be recalled and declared void by their Succeſſours.
Wherefore it has been always a Maxim of Wiſe Men.
that Princes by granting extravagant Priviledges and
Gifts, made their Subjects rather Jealous than Friends;
ſince thoſe who have obtained them, living always in fear
that the ſame either in part or wholly, may be taken
away again, imploy all means ſo to eſtabliſh themſelves
as to be in a capacity to maintain themſelves therein in
ſpite of the Prince. Thoſe Learned Men who are of
an impartial Judgment, take it for granted, that the Pope
did pretend to exerciſe a Sovereign Power over theſe
Countries granted to him by the <hi>French</hi> Kings, but that
the People refuſed the ſame, as being for maintaining
their Liberty; and thinking it very odd, that the Pope
who was an Eccleſiaſtical Perſon, ſhould pretend to be
alſo a Worldly Prince. When therefore the <hi>Romans</hi>
mutinied againſt Pope <hi>Leo</hi> III. he was forced to ſeek
for Aſſiſtance from <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, who reſtored the
Pope. But on the other hand, the Pope and People of
<hi>Rome</hi> proclaimed <hi>Charles</hi> Emperour, whereby he was
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:65650:227"/>
put into poſſeſſion of the Sovereignty over that part of
<hi>Italy,</hi> which formerly belonged to the Juriſdiction of the
Governours at <hi>Ravenna,</hi> and the other remnants of the
Weſtern Empire; ſo that the Pope afterwards enjoyed
theſe Countries under the Sovereign Juriſdiction of the
Emperour, who therefore uſed to be called the Patron
and Defender of the Church, till the Reign of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour

of the Imperial Protection, becauſe the Emperour's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
was required in the Election of a Pope, and if they
were mutinous, the Emperours uſed to check them, and
ſometimes turn them out of the Chair. To exempt
themſelves from this Power of the Emperours over them,
the Popes have for a long time together imployed all
their Cunning and Labour before they could obtain
their Aim. They uſed to make it their conſtant Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to raiſe inteſtine Commotions againſt the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
ſometimes in <hi>Germany,</hi> ſometimes in <hi>Italy,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to diminiſh their Power and Authority. The Biſhops,
eſpecially in <hi>Germany,</hi> were always very buſie, as being
diſſatisfied that they were dependent on the Emperours,
who nominated the Biſhops, and therefore joyned with
the Pope to aſſiſt him in ſetting up the Eccleſiaſtical So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty.

to exclaim againſt the Emperour, that the granting of

The Pope under this pretext, did not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:65650:227"/>
to exempt the Biſhops from the Emperour's Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,

that this Deſign might have been put in execution, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
that <hi>Europe</hi> was at that time divided into ſo

Hand, that the Popes were never able to eſtabliſh their

think it adviſable to fall out at once with the Emperour
and <hi>France,</hi> but that it would be more ſecure to have
one at hand to uphold them againſt the other; eſpecially,
the Popes were not ſo much for weakening of <hi>France,</hi>
becauſe they were not ſo nearly concerned with that

this degree of Grandeur, quickly ſet on foot ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Doctrine, which was of far greater conſequence, <hi>viz.</hi>
That the Pope had an indirect Power over Princes, that
it belonged to him in his own Right to take Care how
they governed and managed their Affairs. For tho'
they did not expreſly pretend in groſs terms that Princes
did depend on them in Civil Affairs, yet they believed
that the ſupreme Eccleſiaſtical Power did entitle them
to an Authority to judge concerning the Actions of
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:65650:228"/>
Princes, whether the ſame were good or bad, to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
them, to correct them, and to command what was
fitting, and to forbid what was unfitting to be done.
If therefore Princes waged War againſt one another,
the Pope pretended to have an Authority to command
a Truce to be made betwixt them, to bring their Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
before him, and refer them to his Deciſion, not
without threatnings that he would not only excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
them in their Perſons, but alſo forbid the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
of Divine Service and adminiſtration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
throughout their whole Kingdom. They alſo did
believe it belonged to their Office to obviate all publick
Scandals, to defend ſuch as were oppreſſed, and to ſee
Juſtice done to all the World. It was from this
pretenſion, that they received the Complaints of all ſuch
as pretended to be oppreſſed; nay, they went further,
for they ſometimes took information concerning the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
done by Princes to their Subjects, and concerning
ſome Impoſitions laid upon the People, whereby the
People thought themſelves aggrieved, which they forbid
to be levied upon them under the penalty of Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication.
Sometimes they uſed to declare the Poſſeſſions
of ſuch as were excommunicated, forfeited, expoſing
their Perſons to danger, and releaſing the Subjects from
their Oaths of Allegiance, under pretence that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of a Chriſtian People ought not to be truſted
to the management of ſuch as had rebelled againſt the
Church. This has been attempted againſt a great many
Crowned Heads, and put in execution againſt ſome of
them.</p>
               <p>This abominable pretenſion (as they perſwade the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant)
was founded upon their fictitious Decretals up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which they have built their Canon-Law,<note place="margin">How they colour over this Power.</note> which
grants to the Pope an unlimited Power over Chriſtians,
by vertue of which, he may as the Common Father,
ſend out his Commands to all Believers, and admoniſh
them concerning all ſuch Matters as belong to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and their Salvation, and in caſe of Diſobedience,
lay puniſhments upon them. For that the Predeceſſours
of <hi>Gregory</hi> VII. did not make uſe of this Power (they
ſay) was becauſe the preceeding Emperours, either kept
themſelves within their bounds, or elſe the Popes lived an
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:65650:229"/>
ungodly Life. To give ſpecious colours to theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions,
they made uſe of the Examples of <hi>Ambroſe</hi> and
<hi>Theodoſius;</hi> they uſed to relate how the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Biſhops
had obliged King <hi>Wamba</hi> by way of penance to lay
down the Crown: As alſo, how the Biſhops of <hi>France</hi>
had depoſed <hi>Lewis</hi> Surnamed the <hi>Pious,</hi> who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
could not recover his Crown without the
Conſent and Authority of another Aſſembly of Biſhops.
They alledged for another Example, how <hi>Fulco</hi> then
Archbiſhop of <hi>Rheims</hi> had threatened <hi>Charles</hi> Sirnamed
the <hi>Simple,</hi> to abſolve his Subjects from their Oaths
of Allegiance, if he made an Alliance with the <hi>Normans,</hi>
who were then Pagans. They ſuppoſed that it was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
queſtion, that the Pope's Power did extend it ſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
that of all other Biſhops, ſince it was not limited
by any thing, except by the expreſs Canons of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
and Decrees of the Popes, wherein nothing was
contained againſt this Power of depoſing of Kings; and
(they ſay) it was not to be ſuppoſed that they could
have been forgetful of this point. And becauſe they had
aſſumed a Power to give the Name and Title of a King
to ſome who either prompted by their Ambition or Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition
had begged the ſame from them, they ſuppoſed
that by the ſame Right, they might take away the Crown
from ſuch as they eſteemed unworthy of wearing it.</p>
               <p>They alſo had forbid to marry within the ſeventh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Conſanguinity, and the fourth of Affinity, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they often met with an opportunity to be trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
to Princes: For becauſe it ſeldom happened a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
thoſe of ſo high a Rank, but that one ſide or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was within one of theſe degrees, they ſtood in
continual fear leſt the Pope ſhould diſturb their Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiations,
except they humbly begged for a Diſpenſation;
and in both caſes the Popes knew how to make their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of them. Laſtly, the Popes having abundance
of Buſineſs to diſpatch, did thereby draw the beſt and
moſt refined Wits to their Courts, who uſed to go thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to look for Imployment, and to perfect themſelves
in the great School of <hi>Europe.</hi> Theſe were always for
promoting the Pope's Intereſt and Deſigns, from whom
they expected their promotion; beſides that, the whole
Clergy did adhere to him as to their ſupreme Head.
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:65650:229"/>
Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> VIII. did clearly give us to underſtand
his meaning at the <hi>Jubilee</hi> kept in the year 1300. when
he appeared ſometimes in the Habit of an Emperour,
ſometimes in that of a Pope, and cauſed two Swords to
be carried before him as the Enſigns of the Eccleſiaſtical
and Civil Power.</p>
               <p>§ 23.<note place="margin">The Papal Authority oppoſed.</note> But the Popes could not long enjoy this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable
Uſurpation in quiet, for it was ſo often called
in queſtion, till they were obliged to draw in their horns,
and to make their pretenſions a little more plauſible. 'Tis
true, in the Buſineſs with the Emperours, the <hi>Henrys</hi> and
the <hi>Fredericks,</hi> they got the upper hand; nevertheleſs,
they met betwixt while often times with very indifferent
entertainment, and ſuch things were ſometimes publiſh'd
againſt them as were little to their Honour, and from
whence it might eaſily be judged by thoſe that were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial,
that not the Glory of God, but their own Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur
was the chief aim of their undertaking. But when
<hi>Boniface</hi> III. pretended to play the ſame Game with
<hi>Philip</hi> Surnamed the <hi>Handſome,</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> he watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his opportunity ſo well, and gave him ſuch a blow, that
the Pope felt the ſmart of it. And to avoid the Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
which the common People might take at theſe ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
proceedings againſt the Pope, uſe was made of this
pretext, that what was done againſt his Perſon, was
not intended againſt the Vicar of Jeſus Chriſt, but againſt
a pernicious Perſon, who by unlawful means was got
into the Chair, and that a general Council ought to be
called to free the Church from his Oppreſſions.</p>
               <p>But the enſuing Schiſms have proved the moſt pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to the Popes Authority,<note place="margin">The Schiſms much weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their Power.</note> as alſo the double Elections
which have been made at ſeveral times, when the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals
being divided, ſet up two Popes at once, who
uſed by turns to excommunicate and revile one another,
and to maintain themſelves in the Chair, were fain to
flatter the Kings, and acknowledge that they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
to them. This Diviſion was an evident ſign, that
the Elections of theſe Popes had not been guided by the
Holy Spirit, but been influenced by ſome ill Deſigns
and Intrigues. Wherefore it was alſo the Opinion of
the Wiſer ſort, that in ſuch a caſe, neither of them ought
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:65650:230"/>
to be acknowledged as Pope, but that a new one ought
to be choſen, which was alſo put in execution at the
Council of <hi>Conſtance.</hi> The firſt Schiſm aroſe, according
to my Opinion in the year 1134. or as ſome will have it
1130. when after the death of <hi>Honorius</hi> II. <hi>Innocent</hi> II. and
<hi>Anacletus</hi> were both choſen Popes. And tho' the firſt
had the greater party on his ſide, yet did the King of
<hi>Sicily</hi> and Duke of <hi>Aquitam,</hi> vigorouſly uphold the latter;
and his adherents did after his death chooſe another in
his ſtead, who called himſelf <hi>Victor,</hi> with whom <hi>Innocent</hi>
made an agreement, ſo that he voluntarily relinquiſhed his
pretenſion, and acknowledged him his Superiour. But
after the death of <hi>Adrian</hi> IV. two Popes were again ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
at one time, <hi>viz. Alexander</hi> III. and <hi>Victor</hi> IV. To
the firſt adhered <hi>France, England,</hi> and <hi>Sicily;</hi> to the latter,
the Emperour <hi>Frederick</hi> I. all <hi>Germany</hi> and the Clergy of
<hi>Rome</hi> And after his death, thoſe of his party choſen three
ſucceſſive Popes, all whom <hi>Alexander</hi> out-lived. Theſe
uſed to make a common Trade to excommunicate and
revile one another, and each of them were fain to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have
themſelves towards their Protectours, more like a
Client than a Maſter. But much greater was the Schiſm
after the death of <hi>Gregory</hi> IX. when again two Popes
were elected at once, whereof one reſided at <hi>Rome,</hi>
the other at <hi>Avignon.</hi> This Schiſm laſted through ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
ſucceſſions, near the ſpace of Forty Years; during
which time, both parties excommunicated one another
very frequently, and committed great Cruelties. <hi>France,
Scotland, Caſtile, Savoy</hi> and <hi>Naples,</hi> were of the ſide of
the Pope that reſided at <hi>Avignon,</hi> but all the reſt of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom
declared for the other at <hi>Rome.</hi> Both parties
took great pains to ſet out the great numbers of Saints
that were of their party, and what Miracles and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
were made concerning their approbation. And
both ſides knew how to produce ſuch Reaſons, that at
laſt, there was no other remedy left them but to force both
the Anti-Popes to abdicate themſelves at the Council of
<hi>Conſtance,</hi> and to chooſe a new one in their ſtead. The
laſt Schiſm of all aroſe when the Council of <hi>Baſil</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
depoſed <hi>Eugenius</hi> IV.<note place="margin">1433.</note> did in his ſtead elect <hi>Felix</hi> V.
Pope, unto whom the former would not ſubmit. And
theſe Diſſentions were continued till after the death of
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:65650:230"/>
                  <hi>Eugenius,</hi> when <hi>Nicholas</hi> V. was choſen in his ſtead, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
whom <hi>Felix</hi> for quiet ſake, did reſign the Chair upon
very advantageous terms in the year 1488.</p>
               <p>It is very eaſily to be imagined how theſe Diviſions
did expoſe to publick view the Secrets of theſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.<note place="margin">Hence an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion taken to bridle the Popes Power by general Councils.</note>
Since from hence an opportunity was taken to
make uſe of the Aſſiſtance of the Councils to bridle the
Popes, and from the Popes to appeal to theſe which
were now made uſe of to terrify the Popes withal, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they pretended to tranſgreſs their bounds. The
Popes could the leſs refuſe to acknowledge the Power of
the Councils at that time, becauſe <hi>Gregory</hi> VII. himſelf
after the quarrel betwixt him and the Emperour was
renewed, had propoſed to call a Council to be held in a
place of Security, where both Friends and Foes, both
the Clergy and Laiety might meet, to judge whether he
or the Emperour had broke the Peace, and to concert
Meaſures how to re-eſtabliſh the ſame. <hi>Gelaſius</hi> II. who
had Differences with <hi>Henry</hi> V. made the ſame Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
adding withal, that he would reſt ſatisfied
with what Judgment his Brothers the Biſhops ſhould give
who were conſtituted Judges in the Church by God
Almighty, and without whom, he could not decide a
Buſineſs of this nature. So <hi>Innocent</hi> III. had writ, that
he would not undertake to decide the Marriage Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie
betwixt <hi>Philip Auguſtus</hi> and <hi>Engebourgh</hi> of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi>
without conſulting a general Council; for if he
ſhould attempt any ſuch thing, he might thereby forfeit
his Office and Dignity. Which words ſeemed intimate,
that a Pope for miſmanagement might be depoſed. And
when afterwards theſe and the like words were made
uſe of againſt the Popes, it was then too late to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to make them paſs for Compliments; ſince it proves
often dangerous to be too modeſt in matters of ſuch
conſequence. Wherefore the Council of <hi>Piſa</hi> in the year
1409. did depoſe the two Anti-Popes, <hi>Benedict</hi> XII and
<hi>Gregory</hi> XII. in whoſe ſtead they choſe another, <hi>viz.
Alexander</hi> V. In the ſame manner the Council of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi>
did not only confirm the depoſition of theſe two
Popes, but alſo turned out <hi>John</hi> XXIV. who was made
Pope after the death of <hi>Alexander</hi> V. In the ſame
manner the Council of <hi>Baſil</hi> did with <hi>Eugenius</hi> IV. and
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:65650:231"/>
beſides this made a Decree that neither at the Court of
<hi>Rome,</hi> neither in other places any mony ſhould be taken
for the diſpatches of Eccleſiaſtical Affairs. All which
as it ſhook the very Foundation of the Papal Chair, ſo
it was not to be admired that the Popes were very
averſe afterwards to call the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and
were forced to make uſe of all their cunning, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
might paſs there to the prejudice of their Grandeur,
and that ſince that time they have bid farewel to Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
for ever.</p>
               <p>§.<note place="margin">Concerning the Seat of the Popes being tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vignon.</hi>
                  </note> 24. Among other diviſions, this has proved very
prejudicial (as it ſeems) to the Authority of the Popes,
that <hi>Clement</hi> V. did transfer the Papal Chair from <hi>Rome</hi>
to <hi>Avignon,</hi> as I ſuppoſe, upon inſtigation of <hi>Philip</hi> Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
the Handſom, King of <hi>France,</hi> who having had
great differences with <hi>Boniface</hi> VIII. was Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
by him. To render this ineffectual, he thought
it the moſt proper way if the Pope reſided in <hi>France,</hi>
and that thereby the like would be prevented for the
future; ſince it was very probable that the greateſt part
of the Cardinals hereafter would be taken out of the
<hi>French</hi> Nation. The Popes made this City their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
place of Reſidence for ſeventy years together, not
to mention that ſome of the Anti-Popes alſo did Reſide
there. This changing of the Seat carry'd along with it
ſeveral inconveniencies, which proved very prejudicial
to the Eccleſiaſtical Monarchy. For the Pope's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
was among other things alſo founded upon this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
that S. <hi>Peter</hi> had been at <hi>Rome,</hi> and by his preſence
had Communicated a particular Prerogative and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to that Chair, and whether the ſame could be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to <hi>Avignon</hi> ſeemed ſomewhat doubtful to a great
many; beſides this, the Pope was then for the moſt
part obliged to comply with <hi>France,</hi> and to live as it
were at the Diſcretion of the <hi>French</hi> Kings. Tho alſo
the <hi>French,</hi> who then thought they had a great Catch,
have ſince complained, that they got little elſe by the
preſence of the <hi>Roman</hi> Court than Simony, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
abominable Vice not fit to be named. Beſides this
the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> being then kept among Strangers,
as it were, out of its Natural Element its Faults were
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:65650:231"/>
the ſooner diſcovered, and the whole the more deſpiſed.
This removal alſo of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> proved very
prejudicial to the Revenue of the Church in <hi>Italy.</hi> For
after the Authority of the Emperors in <hi>Italy</hi> came to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay,
each State was for living free, and being Sovereign
itſelf, and the Factions of the <hi>Guelfs</hi> and <hi>Gibellines</hi>
cauſed moſt horrid diſtractions. And the Authority of
the Pope being vaniſh'd by his abſence, they made bold
with the Church Poſſeſſions. Moſt Cities of the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical
State upon the perſuaſions of the <hi>Florentines</hi>
had ſent away the Popes Legats, and acknowledged no
Sovereign. The Emperor <hi>Lewis,</hi> Surnamed the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varian,</hi>
who was at Enmity with the Pope, but in
great eſteem among the Inhabitants of the Eccleſiaſtical
State, did pretend to the Sovereignty over the ſame, as
being a Fief of the Empire, which he granted to ſuch
as upheld his Party againſt the Pope. The Patrimony
of the Church was then but very ſlender, and tho the
Popes recovered part of it afterwards, they were obliged
to leave moſt in Poſſeſſion of what they had got. But
the City of <hi>Rome</hi> was nevertheleſs at laſt forced to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to the Popes power, which it had reſiſted ſo long,
when <hi>Boniface</hi> IX. in the year 1393. put on the Bridle,
by building the Caſtle of S. <hi>Angelo.</hi> And <hi>Alexander</hi> VI.
was the chief cauſe that the Eccleſiaſtical State was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
under the Obedience of the Popes. This Pope
had a Natural Son, whoſe name was <hi>Caeſar Borgia,</hi> but
who commonly is called Duke of <hi>Valence,</hi> from the
Dukedom of <hi>Valence,</hi> which he got with his Lady
<hi>Charlotte d' Albret.</hi> The Pope being very ambitious to
make this his Son a great Prince in <hi>Italy,</hi> propoſed this
expedient to him, that he muſt drive out theſe petty
Lords, which were then in Poſſeſſion of the Eccleſiaſtical
State, and when he had made himſelf Maſter of theſe
places, he would confirm him in the Poſſeſſion of them
for ever. He ſucceeded very well in this Enterpriſe,
having made away with moſt of theſe petty Lords, ſome
by Force, ſome by Treachery; for he uſed to ſtick at
nothing, alledging, that whatever he did could not be
done amiſs, ſince he had received his Commiſſion from
his Father, who was endowed with the Holy Ghoſt.
And being reduced to the utmoſt want of mony, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:65650:232"/>
to pay his Soldiers, he and his Father agreed to
Poiſon the richeſt Cardinals at a Feaſt intended for that
purpoſe; ſome of whom they alſo knew to be averſe
to their Deſigns. But the Servant who had the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the buſineſs having out of careleſneſs fill'd the

Neither did this Pope reſt ſatisfied, till he had recovered

and magnificent Man, very liberal towards all honeſt
and learned Men, who might have made a very good
Pope, if he had but had an indifferent knowledge of
Religion, and an inclination to Piety, whereas he was
very careleſs of both. He having lived very ſplendidly,
and by his Liberality and Magnificence exhauſted the
Apoſtolical Chamber, and not being acquainted with
the Arts of acquiring Riches, made uſe of the Cardinal
<hi>Laurence Puccius,</hi> who at laſt, when all the other Gold
Mines were emptied, propoſed the way of raiſing mony
by Indulgences. Theſe Indulgences were therefore ſent
abroad all over Chriſtendom, both for the dead and the
living, Eggs, Milk, and the like were allowed to be
eaten on faſt days. The ſeveral ſums of mony thereby
to be raiſed, were beforehand aſſigned to certain uſes;
All what was to be Collected in <hi>Saxony</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about,
as far as to the Sea ſide, having been granted to
<hi>Magdalen</hi> the Pope's Siſter; She to make the beſt of the
Pope's Grant, had committed the whole management
of her ſhare to one <hi>Arcimbold</hi> a Biſhop by his Title and
Coat; but who was moſt experienced in all the <hi>Genoeſe</hi>
Tricks of Merchandiſing. He again employed ſuch as
did proffer the moſt, and had no other proſpect than
the getting of mony. It had been formerly a Cuſtom
in <hi>Saxony</hi> that the Hermits of the Order of S. <hi>Auſtin</hi>
uſed to proclaim the Indulgences. But <hi>Arcimbold</hi>'s Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners,
did not think fit to truſt them at this time,
as knowing them to be expert in that Trade, and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that they might not deal fairly with them, or at
leaſt that they might not bring in more mony than uſed
to be gathered at other times. They choſe therefore
the <hi>Dominicans</hi> to Preach up the Indulgences, which
the <hi>Auſtin</hi> Friers took very ill, as being thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded
of their Authority, Right and Profit. The
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:65650:233"/>
                  <hi>Dominicans</hi> in the mean while, to ſhow themſelves well
qualified for this new Employment, did magnifie their
Ware to that extravagant degree, that their Auditors
were extremely ſcandalized at it; eſpecially ſince the
Commiſſioners lived in continual debaucheries, and ſpent
with great infamy, what the poor Country Fellows
ſpared out of their Bellies, to redeem their ſins. This
obliged <hi>Luther,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luther</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences.</note> a Frier of the Hermits Order of S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin,</hi>

to thoſe, at <hi>Franckfort.</hi> Thus the Diſpute
having been ſet on foot, each of them began to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
himſelf upon the abovementioned Theſes. But
<hi>Luther</hi> having upon his ſide both Reaſon and Scripture,
his Adverſary had nothing to alledge for himſelf, but the
Authority of the Pope and the Church. Wherefore
<hi>Luther</hi> was obliged to make an enquiry,<note place="margin">Afterwards the Popes Power.</note> upon what
Foundation the Authority of the Pope was built, and
in what condition the Church was at that time; which
led him by degrees unto the diſcovery of the Errors and
Abuſes, which were crept into the Church, and to
an invective againſt the Impoſtures, and ſcandalous
lives of the Monks and Prieſts, and that it was a duty
incumbent upon the Magiſtrates to aboliſh theſe Abuſes.
And to this purpoſe, as alſo to oblige the Magiſtrates
to uphold his Doctrine, he ſpoke very magnificently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Nature and Grandeur of the Civil Power,
which the Prieſts hitherto had repreſented as deſpicable.
By which means he at firſt got a great Party, and his
Doctrine was ſpread abroad every where.</p>
               <p>§.<note place="margin">The Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of theſe times.</note> 26. But that we may the better underſtand the
Reaſon, why a Poor Frier was able to give ſuch a blow
to the Chair of <hi>Rome,</hi> we muſt, next to the Supreme
Direction of God Almighty, conſider the circumſtances
of theſe times, and what diſpoſition there was at that
juncture of time in the minds of the People in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.
Firſt then, <hi>Luther</hi>'s Propoſitions concerning the
Indulgences were very good and reaſonable, and a great
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:65650:233"/>
many Divines, which afterwards oppoſed his Doctrine,
were at firſt of his ſide, as were alſo ſome Cardinals,
and <hi>George</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> himſelf. His Adverſaries
were ſo perverſe, that every body lamented their folly
and perverſeneſs. Neither was it at firſt in the leaſt
ſuſpected, that things would go ſo far as they did. <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
himſelf had at firſt not the leaſt thoughts of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
off from the <hi>Pope.</hi> The Emperor <hi>Maximilian</hi> had
no averſion to the Doctrine of <hi>Luther,</hi> and it is credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
related, that, when he firſt heard of him, he did
ſay; that this Frier ought to be kept ſafe, ſince good
uſe might be made of him. Some Monks only, and
theſe Commiſſioners, who were likely to be the loſers
by it, did make ſuch a clamour, and raiſed ſuch tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults
by blowing up the Coals, that this ſmall Spark
broke out into a great Flame. Whole Chriſtendom was
alſo in a miſerable condition, it being quite over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed
with Ceremonies; the perverſe Monks, did
what they pleaſed, and had entangled tender Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
in their Snares. All Divinity was turned into So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtry
New Doctrines and Propoſitions were broach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
without any regard, how they ought to be proved
and maintained. And the whole Clergy of all degrees
had rendred their Lives and Converſations odious
and deſpiſed to the World. The late Popes <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
VI. and <hi>Julius</hi> II. had been infamous for their
Pride, Treachery, turbulent Spirit, and other ſuch like
Vices, as were very ill becoming Eccleſiaſtical perſons.
Such Biſhops as were fit for ſomething had quite en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled
themſelves in worldly buſineſs; a great many
of them led a moſt ſcandalous Life, and were more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert
in Hunting, than skilled in the Bible. The Prieſts
and Monks were over Head and Ears in Ignorance, and
ſcandalized the Common People by their Debaucheries,
and their Avarice was grown unſupportable to every
body.</p>
               <p>Beſides all this,<note place="margin">The Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>'s Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries.</note> thoſe who firſt pretended to oppoſe

them debauched wretches; theſe, when they ſaw <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
maintain his Arguments in a manner which was not
common at that time, were ſoon confounded and put
to a <hi>nonplus,</hi> not knowing where to begin or to end.
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:65650:234"/>
'Tis true, in former Ages alſo the Clergy had not been
free from Vices, but the Ignorance of thoſe barbarous
times had ſerved them for a Cloak. But after <hi>Europe</hi>
began to be reſtored to its flouriſhing condition, and all
ſorts of Learning began to diſpel the former darkneſs,
it was then that theſe abominable Spots became more
conſpicuous to the Eyes of the World. As the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
Prieſts and Monks, who could not bear the
glance of this bright ſhining Light, were ſtark mad at
thoſe who had reſtored Learning to <hi>Europe,</hi> and did
them all the miſchief they could, and when they found
themſelves worſted by them, uſed to make a Point of
Religion of their different Diſputes, and to accuſe thoſe
of Hereſie that were more Learned than themſelves:
ſo theſe uſed to expoſe their folly, and as much as in
them lay to diſcover their Ignorance to the World.
'Twas upon this account, the impudent Monks pick'd
a quarrel with <hi>John Reuchlin,</hi> whom they fain would
have made a Heretick; from whence that learned Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lrick van Hutten</hi> (if I remember right) took an
opportunity to expoſe them moſt miſerably in <hi>Epiſtolis
obſcurorum virorum.</hi> Whilſt the War betwixt the Lovers
and the Perſecutors of Learning was carried on with great
heat on both ſides, <hi>Luther</hi>'s Doctrine appeared in the
World. And becauſe the Monks made it their buſineſs
to bring the moſt learned Men into the ſame Quarrel
which they had againſt <hi>Luther,</hi> in hopes to ſtrike them
both down at one blow, this proved the occaſion that
moſt of the learned Men in <hi>Germany</hi> did actually ſide
with <hi>Luther.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eraſmus <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured</hi> Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note>
               </p>
               <p>It is alſo undeniable that <hi>Eraſmus</hi> of <hi>Rotterdam</hi>
had a conſiderable ſhare in the Reformation, for he
had before already diſcovered, and reprehended a great
many Abuſes and Errors, he had rejected the School
Divinity, and recommended the reading of the Bible
and Fathers: he had ridiculed the Barbarity and Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
which was upheld by the Monks, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
at firſt <hi>Luther</hi>'s Cauſe, tho he always excepted
againſt his violent and biting way of writing. His ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
alone proved very miſchievous to <hi>Luther</hi>'s Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries.
For <hi>Eraſmus</hi> being then eſteemed the moſt learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Divine of his Age, every body took his ſilence for a
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:65650:234"/>
kind of an approbation of <hi>Luther</hi>'s Cauſe. And when
he afterwards publiſhed his Treatiſe <hi>de libero Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrio,</hi>
it made no great impreſſion upon the minds
of the People, ſince it ſufficiently appeared, that
it was rather writ to pleaſe others, than of his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination.
Beſides that this was not the main Point
in diſpute, and <hi>Luther</hi> did refute ſufficiently his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions.</p>
               <p>The Princes and Eſtates of <hi>Germany</hi> alſo having been
ſufficiently convinced,<note place="margin">The Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> diſſatisfied with the Pope.</note> that heavy Impoſitions had been
laid upon them of late under ſeveral pretences by the
Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> for no other purpoſe but to maintain the
Grandeur of the Eccleſiaſticks at <hi>Rome,</hi> were extremely
diſſatisfied with the Pope. The general fear which was
then in <hi>Germany</hi> of an Invaſion by the <hi>Turks,</hi> and the
differences ariſen betwixt <hi>Charles</hi> V. <hi>Francis</hi> I. and
<hi>Henry</hi> VIII. did greatly promote the Reformation,
ſince there was but little time for to think much of
theſe Diſputes. Some are of Opinion, that <hi>Charles</hi> V.
did connive at the ſpreading of the Doctrine of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
throughout <hi>Germany,</hi> hoping by theſe Diviſions to
get an opportunity to ſuppreſs the antient Liberty of
the Eſtates, and to make himſelf Sovereign over <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</hi>
For elſe (they ſay) he might eaſily have quenſh'd
the Fire at firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> in the year 1521. when he had
<hi>Luther</hi> in his power at <hi>Wormes,</hi> where he might have
ſecured him, which would have paſſed well enough for
a State Trick. But it is not ſo evident, whether, tho
<hi>Luther</hi> had been murthered againſt the Publick Faith
granted him, thereby his Doctrine would have been
rooted out; it is more probable that the Emperor, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then but young, did not at that time foreſee of what
Conſequence this buſineſs might prove afterwards; and
that he did not think it adviſable at that juncture of
time to break with the Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> who was
then in great Authority. Neither could he pretend at
the ſame time, when he was engaged in a War againſt
<hi>France</hi> and the <hi>Turks,</hi> to attack the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi>
that were then courted by <hi>Francis,</hi> and who began to
make Alliances with them. Yet it is certain that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the pretence of Religion he afterwards made War
upon the Proteſtant Eſtates of <hi>Germany,</hi> and intended
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:65650:235"/>
by their ruin to open himſelf the way to the Abſolute
Monarchy over <hi>Germany.</hi> And tho he was very ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesful
in the War againſt the League made at <hi>Smalkald,</hi>
nevertheleſs he could not accompliſh his projected de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
becauſe he ſtood in need of the aſſiſtance of the
<hi>German</hi> Princes againſt <hi>France,</hi> and the <hi>Turks,</hi> and to
obtain the Imperial Crown for his Son <hi>Philip.</hi> Nay
<hi>Paul</hi> III. himſelf dreaded the growing greatneſs of the
Emperor, to that degree that he ſtirr'd up the <hi>French</hi> to
oppoſe his prevailing Power, and to prevent the entire
ruine of the Proteſtants, allowed them to make uſe of
the Alliance with the <hi>Turks</hi> againſt the Emperor, who
he feared intended a thorough Reformation of the Court
of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And beſides all this the ill Conduct of the Pope did
great miſchief to the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Party.<note place="margin">The ill Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of <hi>Leo</hi> and Cardinal <hi>Cajetan.</hi>
                  </note> For it
was a grand miſtake in <hi>Leo</hi> X. that he with ſo much vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
declared himſelf for theſe Merchants of Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences,
and by his Bull of the 9. of <hi>November</hi> in the
year 1518. decided the Points in Controverſie betwixt
them, whereby he cut of all hopes and means for an
Accommodation. It would queſtionleſs have been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for him to have ſtood Neuter, and to have impoſed
ſilence upon both Parties, and in the mean while to have
found out an expedient to appeaſe <hi>Luther.</hi> And Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
<hi>Cajetan</hi> did in the year 1519. act a very impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Part at <hi>Augsburgh,</hi> when he dealt ſo very rudely
with <hi>Luther,</hi> and refuſed to accept of his Propoſal, <hi>viz.</hi>
that he would be ſilent, provided his Adverſaries would
do the ſame. For by this refuſal made to ſo reſolute a
Man, whom he would have obliged to make a Recan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
he forced him to do his utmoſt, and to fall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
upon the Pope himſelf. It would have been no
difficult matter to have granted him, that ſome corrupted
Manners were crept into the Church, to keep him from
meddling with the Reformation of the Doctrines. But
on the contrary, the Pope making continual inſtances at
the Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi>'s Court, to have <hi>Luther</hi> delivered
up to him, <hi>Luther</hi> was thereby obliged, to ſhow the
unreaſonableneſs of the Pope, and to demonſtrate that
his own Doctrine was built upon a very ſolid and good
Foundation. And the Pope rendred his Cauſe very
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:65650:235"/>
ſuſpicious, that he, when <hi>Luther</hi> appeal'd to a Council,
did by making a great many evaſions protract to call
one: From hence it was evident that he did not truſt
much to the goodneſs of his Cauſe, if it were to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated
before impartial Judges. It was alſo an unlucky
hit for the Pope, when he fell out with <hi>Henry</hi> VIII.
who to ſpite the Pope, did open the Door for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Religion to be ſettled in <hi>England.</hi> Likewiſe did
thoſe of the Houſe of <hi>Navarre</hi> propagate and protect
the Proteſtant Religion in <hi>France,</hi> out of a hatred, as
ſome ſay, againſt the Pope, who had ſhown the way to
<hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Catholick into that Kingdom. Beſides
this there were abundance of good Men of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Catholick Religion, who were glad to ſee that <hi>Luther</hi>
did waſh the ſcabby Heads of the Monks with ſo
ſtrong a Lye, as he did. So that every thing ſeemed
to concur to promote the Decree of God Almighty.</p>
               <p>§.<note place="margin">Why the Doctrine of <hi>Luther</hi> was not ſpread farther.</note> 27. But, why the Doctrine of <hi>Luther</hi> was not
ſpread farther, and the Eccleſiaſtical Monarchy was not
quite overturned, ſeveral Reaſons may be alledged.
Firſt it is to be conſidered, that, in thoſe States, where
<hi>Luther</hi>'s Doctrine was received, the Supreme Direction
in Eccleſiaſtical Affairs became neceſſarily to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved
on the Civil Magiſtrates. For if any one of
theſe States would have pretended to this Direction
over the others of the ſame Communion, theſe, who
would have thought themſelves no leſs capable, would
never have acknowledged the ſame. Which did not a
little weaken their Union and Strength, and was the
main occaſion, that they could not act ſo unanimouſly
and vigorouſly againſt the Pope, as he againſt them.
It is alſo to be conſidered, that this Reformation was
not undertaken after mature deliberation, and as it were
on purpoſe to form or ſet up a new State; but this great
Revolution happened upon a ſudden and unexpectedly,
ſo that the whole Work was carried on as occaſion
offer'd and by degrees. And tho <hi>Luther</hi> was the firſt,
that gave the Alarm, yet the reſt did not think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
obliged to follow preciſely his Opinion, but were
alſo ambitious of having contributed ſomething towards
the Reformation. This occaſioned Diſputes among
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:65650:236"/>
themſelves,<note place="margin">Diviſions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Proteſtants.</note> and becauſe no body had an Authority a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, to decide theſe Controverſies, each Party
perſiſted obſtinately in their Opinion; from whence
aroſe ſuch a Schiſm, that they became neglectful of
the Common Enemy, and fell upon one another. This
furniſhed the Popiſh Party with a very probable Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
who cry'd out aloud the Hereticks were faln into
Confuſion among themſelves, as not knowing what to
believe; and ſince they had left the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
they were brought into an endleſs Labyrinth. There
were alſo a great many of the Proteſtants, who under
pretext of the Goſpel did lead an impious and ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
life,<note place="margin">The Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs of ſome Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants.</note> as if by the Liberty of the Goſpel they had
obtained a Licenſe to abandon themſelves to all ſorts
of Vices. This gave alſo occaſion to the Papiſts to
defame the Doctrine of <hi>Luther;</hi> eſpecially ſince he had
with great ſeverity reproved the licenciouſneſs of the
Clergy, and had been generally applauded for it. It
alſo proved very miſchievous to <hi>Luther</hi>'s Doctrine, that
immediately after whole ſwarms of Fanaticks, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts
and the like appear'd in the World, and that
the Boors in <hi>Germany</hi> run as it were mad, and made a
moſt dangerous Inſurrection. When ſome Princes took
this Point into Conſideration, the Doctrine of <hi>Luther</hi>
began to become ſuſpicious to them, as if thereby the
licenciouſneſs of the Common People was Taught and
Authoriſed; which they looking upon as a greater
Evil, than what oppreſſion they were likely to ſuffer
from the Clergy, did with all their Power oppoſe the
Doctrine of <hi>Luther.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are ſome who will have it,<note place="margin">The Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of <hi>Paris.</hi>
                  </note> that the Univerſity
of <hi>Paris</hi> alſo had a ſhare in this. For <hi>Luther</hi> having
perſuaded himſelf, that this Univerſity was diſſatisfied
at <hi>Leo</hi> X. becauſe he had aboliſhed the Pragmatick
Sanction, concerning the Elections of Biſhops; and
that therefore the Members thereof would be glad of an
opportunity to revenge themſelves, he ſubmitted his
Diſputation with <hi>Eckius</hi> to their Judgment; but theſe
gave their Judgment againſt him, and that in very hard
words. The Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> alſo did afterwards conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that it was for their purpoſe to take upon them the
protection of the <hi>Roman</hi> Chair; wherefore they oppoſed
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:65650:236"/>
the Proteſtant Doctrine with all their might, and ſo
powerfully aſſiſted the League in <hi>France,</hi> that <hi>Henry</hi> IV.
if he would maintain his Crown, was obliged to leave
the Proteſtant Religion.</p>
               <p>Some alſo have obſerved;<note place="margin">Zwinglius <hi>and</hi> Calvin.</note> that when <hi>Zwinglius,</hi> and
afterwards <hi>Calvin,</hi> began all upon a ſudden to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
too great a Reformation, not only as to the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
but alſo the Eſſential parts of the Church, and
thereby fell from one extreme to another: this proved a
main obſtacle to the increaſe of the Proteſtant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
For <hi>Luther</hi> had hitherto made very little alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in outward Matters. He had left in the Churches
the Ornaments, Clocks, Organs, Candles, and ſuch
like, he had retained the greateſt part of the Maſs,
but had added ſome Prayers in the Native Tongue
ſo that he was looked upon by moſt as a Reformer of
the Abuſes only. But when it ſeem'd that this Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was likely to become Univerſal, <hi>Zwinglius</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
in <hi>Switzerland,</hi> as did <hi>Calvin</hi> afterwards in
<hi>France;</hi> theſe, inſtead of following the footſteps of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
began to Preach againſt the Preſence of the Body
of Chriſt in the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, aboliſh'd
all ſorts of Ceremonies and Ornaments, deſtroyed all
Reliques, broke the Altars and Images, aboliſh'd all
order of the Hierarchy, and deſpoiled Religion of all
ſuch things as did moſt affect the Eyes and exteriour
Senſes of the People. This cauſed an averſion and
animoſity in the Common People againſt them, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
its Zeal for that Religion, which it had received
from its Anceſtors. The Riches of the Church did
partly promote <hi>Luther</hi>'s Doctrine, a great many having
thereby taken an opportunity to poſſeſs themſelves of
of theſe ample Revenues; nevertheleſs the ſame kept a
great many Prelates under the obedience of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Chair, who, if they had not been afraid of loſing their
Rich Benefices, would not have been ſo backward to
ſide with <hi>Luther</hi>'s Party. This was manifeſtly to be
ſeen in <hi>France,</hi> where both the Prelates and Common
People had made no great account of the Popes Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
before the Reformation, but when they ſaw
that thoſe of the Reformed Religion were for breaking
into their Quarters, they agreed better afterwards with
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:65650:237"/>
the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Commonalty was very
Zealous againſt the Reformed Religion.</p>
               <p>§.<note place="margin">The Popiſh Sovereignty recovered.</note> 28. But beſides this the Pope, as ſoon as his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents
had recovered themſelves from their firſt conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
and his Enemies were faln out among themſelves,
has ſince ſettled his Affairs in ſuch a manner, that the
Proteſtants in all likelyhood will not only not be able
to hurt him for the future, but he alſo by degrees gets
ground of them. For thoſe things wherewith <hi>Luther</hi>
did upbraid them, and did the moſt miſchief to them,
they have either quite aboliſh'd, or at leaſt they are
tranſacted in a more decent manner; <hi>Si non caſtè, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
cautè:</hi> They have alſo made uſe of the ſame Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons,
wherewith <hi>Luther</hi> did attack them. For the
Popes now a days do not inſult with ſo much haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs
over Princes, but treat them with more Civility
and Lenity. It is true, in the laſt Age <hi>Paul</hi> IV. behaved
himſelf very impudently towards <hi>Spain,</hi> and in our
Age <hi>Paul</hi> V. did the ſame with <hi>Venice.</hi> But by the
mediation of wiſer Heads, theſe Differences were
Compoſed, before they could draw after them any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ill Conſequences; and the Popes ever ſince have
been ſufficiently convinced, that theſe hot-headed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
are in no ways ſuitable to their preſent condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
For <hi>Paul</hi> V. did quickly give fair words, when
the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadour made him believe, that the
<hi>Venetians</hi> had ſent for ſome Miniſters from <hi>Geneva,</hi> to
be inſtructed in the Principles of the Reformed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
Neither have of late years ſate ſuch Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees
in the Papal Chair as <hi>Alexander</hi> VI. or ſuch Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Popes as <hi>Julius</hi> II. was, but of late they have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to carry on their Intreagues under hand,
whilſt they in outward appearance pretend to be the
Promoters and Mediatours of Peace. That moſt
ſcandalous Trade of Indulgences, and that groſs ſort
of Simony they have ſet aſide, whilſt they make it
their buſineſs to cajole the People out of their mony,
in a more handſome manner.</p>
               <p>The Biſhops are now of another Stamp,<note place="margin">The Biſhops, Prieſts, and Monks, more Regular and Learn'd than heretofore.</note> and carry it
on with much more gravity than before the times of
<hi>Luther,</hi> nay, there are now among the Prelats eccellent
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:65650:237"/>
and well qualified Men. The Ordinary Prieſts and
Monks alſo have been much Reformed in their Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and been obliged to lay aſide their former brutiſh
Ignorance. <hi>Luther</hi> And his adherents did at firſt gain
mightily upon the People by their moſt excellent and
learned Sermons, and by their Books which they pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd
thereby to excite the People to Piety, Prayers,
godly Meditations and Exerciſes. Both which the
Papiſts have imitated ſince, for among them now adays
are to be found moſt excellent Preachers, and very good
Prayer-Books; ſo that the Proteſtant Clergy has now
not much to object againſt them, as to their ability or
outward behaviour. They have alſo got a very good
inſight into all the Controverted Points, and have a
doſen or more Diſtinctions at hand againſt any Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
For example: whereas nothing ſeems more ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
than that the Pope ſhould grant his Indulgences
for twenty or thirty thouſands years to come, they
know how to give this a fine colour by theſe Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of <hi>Intenſive</hi> and <hi>Extenſive, Potentialiter</hi> and
<hi>Actualiter,</hi> which reliſh ſtrangely with young Students,
and the ignorant ſuppoſe them to be terms full of My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries.
And becauſe the Ignorance of the Clergy, and
the hatred conceived againſt Learning and learned Men,
had proved very prejudicial to the Popiſh Monarchy,
the Popiſh Clergy, and eſpecially the Jeſuits, have ſince
altered their Courſe, and having taken upon them the
Education of Youth, have pretended to the Monopoly
of Learning among the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks; ſo that
ſince that time Learning has not only not been prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
but very profitable to them.</p>
               <p>Laſtly,<note place="margin">How they make Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts.</note> they now adays do not make uſe of Fire and
Sword to propagate the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Religion, but
the chief Men among the Proteſtants are inticed to
come over to their Party with fair Words, great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
and actual Recompenſes. If any one who is
well qualified will go over to their Party he may be
ſure to make his Fortune, ſince the Wealth of their
Church furniſhes them with ſufficient Means to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
ſuch a Perſon, tho his Merits were not extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary.
Whereas on the contrary, if any one goes over
from them to the Proteſtants Religion, and either has
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:65650:238"/>
not wherewithal to live, or elſe is endowed with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary

in what manner this Eccleſiaſtical Sovereignty
has extended her Power over the Weſtern parts of
Chriſtendom. But throughly to underſtand the whole
Structure, and Compoſure of this Engine, and by what
means it is ſuſtained, it will not be improper to conſider
the Pope in two different ways; firſt as a Prince in
<hi>Italy,</hi> and ſecondly as the ſpiritual Monarch over the
Weſtern Church. As to the firſt it is to be obſerved,
that the Pope may be reckoned a Potent Prince in <hi>Italy,</hi>
but is in no ways to be Compared with the other
Princes in <hi>Europe.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> The Countries under his Juriſdiction
are the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> with her Territories ſituated on
both ſides of the River <hi>Tyber;</hi> the Dukedom of <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vento</hi>
in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> the Dukedoms of
<hi>Spoleto, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbino</hi> and <hi>Ferrara,</hi> the Marquiſate of <hi>Ancona,</hi>
ſeveral places in <hi>Tuſcany, Romaniola</hi> or <hi>Flaminia,</hi> where
are ſituated <hi>Bologna</hi> and <hi>Ravenna.</hi> In <hi>France</hi> the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of <hi>Avignon</hi> belongs to him. <hi>Parma</hi> is a Fief of the
Church, which <hi>Paul</hi> III. granted to his Son <hi>Lewis Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe.</hi>
But ſince that time a Conſtitution has been made,
that it ſhall not be in the power of any Pope to Alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
any Fief, or to grant any of the Countries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the Church in Fief to any perſon whatſoever,
to prevent the ruin of the Eccleſiaſtick State, and,
that, in caſe the Revenues from abroad ſhould fail, the
Pope nevertheleſs might not want means to maintain
himſelf and his Court. The Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> is alſo
a Fief of the Church, in acknowledgment of which the
King of <hi>Spain</hi> every year preſents the Pope with a white
Horſe, and ſome thouſands of Ducats. What other
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:65650:238"/>
Pretenſions the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> makes are out of date.
For the reſt, theſe Countries are indifferently Populous
and Fertile, having ſeveral Cities of Note, out of which
the Pope receives a Revenue of two Millions <hi>per annum.</hi>
And the Popes Miniſters take effectual care, that their
Subjects may not be overgrown in riches.</p>
               <p>Perhaps there might be a conſiderable number of
good Soldiers maintained out of the Eccleſiaſtick Eſtate,<note place="margin">His Forces.</note>
but his Military ſtrength is ſcarce worth taking notice
of, ſince he makes uſe of quite other means to preſerve
his State than other Princes do. He maintains about
twenty Gallies, which have their Station at <hi>Civita Vec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia.</hi>
The chief State maxim of the Pope, as a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Prince is, that Peace may be preſerved in <hi>Italy,</hi>
and that <hi>Italy</hi> may remain in the ſame State, as it is now,
and eſpecially, that there may not be introduced any
other Sovereign Power, which might prove ſo formidable
as to domineer over the reſt. He muſt take great care
that the <hi>Turks</hi> may not get footing in <hi>Italy,</hi> and in caſe
of an Invaſion from the <hi>Turks,</hi> not only <hi>Italy</hi> would
be obliged to join againſt them, but alſo whole
Chriſtendom muſt be called in to help to chaſe out
theſe Barbarians, ſince no Chriſtian Prince would be
contented that this delicious Country ſhould fall into
their hands.</p>
               <p>The Pope has nothing to fear more from the <hi>German</hi>
Empire,<note place="margin">How he ſtands with relation to <hi>Germany, Spain</hi> and <hi>France.</hi>
                  </note> as long as it remains upon the ſame Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
But if it ſhould fall under the Government of an
Abſolute Monarch, it is likely he might attempt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
the Antient Pretenſions. <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France</hi> are the
two Kingdoms, which are moſt formidable to the Pope.
Againſt them the Pope makes uſe of this Maxim, that
he either ſets them together by the Ears, or at leaſt keeps
up the Ballance betwixt them, that one may not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
quite Maſter of the other. I am apt to believe
that the Pope would be glad with all his heart, that
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were driven out of <hi>Italy,</hi> eſpecially out
of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples.</hi> But it is ſcarce to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
that he ſhould be able to do it by his own
ſtrength, and to make uſe of the <hi>French</hi> in this caſe,
would be to fall out of the Frying-Pan into the Fire.
Therefore all what the Pope can do, is, to take care,
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:65650:239"/>
that <hi>Spain</hi> may not encroach upon others in <hi>Italy;</hi> and
there is no queſtion but if the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſhould attempt
any ſuch thing, <hi>France</hi> and all the other <hi>Italian</hi> States
would be ready to oppoſe their deſign. Neither can it
be pleaſing to the Pope, if the King of <hi>France</hi> ſhould get
ſo much footing in <hi>Italy,</hi> as to be able to ſway Matters
there according to his pleaſure, which the Pope ought to
prevent with all his might. The Pope need not fear
much from the other States of <hi>Italy.</hi> For tho' ſome of
them are under hand his Enemies, and dread his Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Power, ſome of them alſo have been chaſtiſed by
the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> nevertheleſs, they muſt at leaſt in
outward appearance pay to the Pope a due Veneration,
neither dare they as much as deviſe to make any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts
upon the Pope. Notwithſtanding this, they would
not look with a good Eye upon the Pope, if he ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to make any Conqueſts upon his Neighbours and
enlarge his Dominions; this refined Nation being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
jealous, and deſirous to keep up the ballance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the States of <hi>Italy.</hi>

               <p>§ 30.<note place="margin">Particular Conſtitution of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy as Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual.</note> But if we conſider the Pope, ſecondly, as the
Spiritual Monarch of Chriſtendom and the Vicar of
Jeſus Chriſt upon Earth, we meet in this Spiritual State
with ſuch ſurpriſing and ſubtile pieces, that it muſt be
confeſſed, that ſince the beginning of the World, there
has not been ſet up a more artificial Fabrick than the
Popiſh Monarchy. It has required the more ſagacity to
erect and ſuſtain this Structure, the more the ends of
this Sovereignty are quite different from the ends of all
other States in the World, and the more feeble the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
appears upon which it is founded. For it is the main
end of other Commonwealths, to live in Security and
Peace; for the maintaining of which, the Subjects con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
a ſhare out of their Goods and Poſſeſſions; nay,
venture their lives that they may ſufficiently provide
againſt the attempts of malicious People, and live in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
and without danger from their Enemies. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
this, it is the Duty of every Subject to take care
that he may be able to maintain himſelf out of his own
Revenues, or by his Labour and Induſtry. But the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
Monarch's chief deſign is, that the Popes and the
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:65650:239"/>
Clergy may live in Plenty and Splendour in this World,
all which is to be maintained at the Coſt and Charge
of other People, who muſt be perſwaded to part
with their Money by ſeveral ſhining Arguments and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial
Perſuaſions. And whereas other States are fain
to maintain their Forces and Garriſons with great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences,
the Pope on the contrary entertains his Militia
without any Charge, but rather with Profit to himſelf.
And whereas it is alſo a State Maxim among the wiſer
Princes, not to extend their Conqueſts too far, the Pope
has no occaſion to imitate them in this point, ſince it is
neither dangerous nor troubleſome to him, tho' he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
his Juriſdiction over the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt Indies.</hi>
The Rights of Sovereignty are founded upon evident
and undeniable Principles and divine Inſtitution, ſince
without it, it is impoſſible that mankind ſhould live ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly,
ſecurely, commodiouſly and decently. But to
find out the ſame neceſſity and foundation of the Pope's
Sovereign Authority, and to demonſtrate that as the
Peace and Welfare of Mankind, cannot ſubſiſt without
a ſupreme Civil Power; ſo the Chriſtian World can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be without a ſupreme Eccleſiaſtical Power, is in my
mind impoſſible to be done. He that is unwilling to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
this, let him find out a demonſtrative proof and
he will be the miracle of the World. But if the Pope's
Champions pretend to a poſitive Command from God
Almighty, they are obliged to prove by clear and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
proofs, and that in all its clauſes and determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
out of the Holy Scripture; that our Saviour when
he ſent his Diſciples all over the World to preach the
Chriſtian Faith, did give them full Power, not only to
propagate the Chriſtian Doctrine among all Nations,
and not to be dependent on any humane Power in their
Office, ſo as thereby to be hindered from preaching
or forced to add or retrench any thing from their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
(which Power is unqueſtionable:) But alſo that
they had a Power granted them, to put into the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry
of the Goſpel, and that without the Conſent of the
Magiſtrates (tho' the ſame profeſſed the true Chriſtian
Religion) as many and whom they pleaſed; that they
alſo might grant to theſe again full Power to increaſe
their Order to ſuch a number as they ſhould think fit
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:65650:240"/>
themſelves, without having any regard to the Civil
Power or Magiſtrates, whoſe Right and Title is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
empaired. And becauſe they cannot live upon the
Air, they muſt alſo have a Power granted them to ſeek
out all ways and means not only for their ſubſiſtance,
but alſo for carrying on their pride and extravagancies.
They muſt alſo have a prerogative granted them of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
exempted from the Civil Juriſdiction both in their
perſons and ſuch poſſeſſions as they have acquired to
themſelves, tho' the ſame appertain to the Revenues of
the Commonwealth, are ſituated in the Territories, and
enjoy the protection of the Sovereign, who is to have no
power to lay Taxes upon them, to preſcribe them li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
or imploy them to any other uſes. They muſt
alſo prove that the ſupreme Direction over this Order as
well concerning their Office as their Poſſeſſions does be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to one of the ſame Order on whom the reſt depend
as their Sovereign, and that the Civil Magiſtrates can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
pretend to any ſuperiour Juriſdiction over them, tho'
the Eccleſiaſtical Order either by its number or misbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
ſhould prove pernicious to the State, and tho'
the State could not be maintained without the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
of the Eccleſiaſticks, which muſt not be imployed
for the benefit of the publick without the Conſent of
him who has the ſupreme Direction over this Order.
Beſides this, they are obliged alſo to prove ſome other
<hi>Hypotheſes</hi> of theirs, which are Matter of Fact. As for
example, that our Saviour Chriſt did grant the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Sovereignty over the Church to St. <hi>Peter</hi> only, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
allowing the leaſt ſhare to the reſt of the Apoſtles.
That he did grant this Prerogative, not only to St. <hi>Peter</hi>
for his own perſon, but alſo that the ſame ſhould be a
perpetual Inheritance to ſuch as ſhould ſucceed him in
that place where he reſided as Biſhop. Beſides this, they
muſt prove that St. <hi>Peter</hi> was actually Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi>
that he exerciſed the ſame Power there, and granted the
ſaid Prerogative to no other place where he uſed to
preach beſides <hi>Rome.</hi> And becauſe theſe Points are ſo
very hard to be proved, the Popiſh Doctors are obliged
to be very cautious in propoſing theſe Queſtions di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly
to the World, but rather treat of the ſame confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly
and ſuperficialy. It is rather their buſineſs to fill
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:65650:240"/>
the Peoples Heads with far-fetch'd Arguments which do
not ſo nearly touch the point, <hi>viz.</hi> concerning the great
Promiſes, that the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt
the Church, concerning the great Authority and Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Church, her Antiquity, the Succeſſion of the
Popes, the Holy Fathers and Councils, the Authority of
ſo many Ages and Nations, Miracles and ſuch like ſtuff,
fit for a Declamation. They alſo make uſe of another
expedient, <hi>viz.</hi> that if any one dares to contradict theſe
things, he is immediately without hearing his reaſons,
branded with the Name of a Heretick, and eſteemed
as one that being a novice and ignorant in his Trade,
ought not to be ſo bold as to contradict his Maſter, but
deſerves to be burnt.</p>
               <p>§ 31.<note place="margin">Why the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty was to be exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Form of a Monarchy.</note> It is eaſily to be imagined, that this ſpiritual So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty
was of neceſſity to be eſtabliſhed in the form
of a Monarchy, ſince it was in no ways ſuitable to a
Democratical or Ariſtocratical Government, not only by
reaſon of ſeveral inconveniencies which would have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
it, but more eſpecially, becauſe that ſo many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Heads as ſway a Democratical and Ariſtocratical
Government, would even by the moſt ſevere Laws ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have been kept in ſuch a Union, but that by raiſing
of Factions and Diſſenſions they would have eaſily
overturned a Work which was built upon ſo ſlight a
Foundation. But among the ſeveral ſorts of Monarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Governments, they have choſen ſuch a one as that
by all the Art of Men, there could not have been inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
one more ſuitable to their purpoſe; it being moſt
certain that all the ſpeculative Inventions of the moſt
refined Politicians, are not in the leaſt to be compared to
what may be met wital in this Popiſh Monarchy. 'Tis
true, ſome Princes have gained to themſelves and their
Government a great Authority, by pretending to be the
Off-ſpring of the Gods, and that they had laid the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of their Government by the expreſs Command
of the Gods and by their peculiar Approbation; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they uſed to be after their death placed in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the Gods, and were adored as ſuch. But the
Pope has gone farther, and perſwaded the People that
he is the Lieutenant of Jeſus Chriſt, who has all Power
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:65650:241"/>
in Heaven and Earth, and his Vicar in the World, and
that in a more exalted Senſe than it is ſpoken of the
Magiſtrates, that they are Miniſters of God's Juſtice up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Earth. For he pretends that he has the Power of
diſpenſing the Merits of Jeſus Chriſt, and that ſuch as
refuſe to acknowledge this Prerogative, are not capable
of obtaining Salvation. And ſince there is nothing more
powerful in this World to induce People to a profound
Veneration than the Divine Majeſty, and no motive
more ſtrong to enforce from them an obedience and an
entire ſubmiſſion to all ſorts of hardſhip than the fear
of God's wrath and eternal damnation; it is evident that
if this Point is once gained and the People thoroughly
perſwaded, there needs no further proof of the reſt of
their Articles of Faith, than that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

Government the moſt convenient and leaſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
have introduced that form into their States; but
this form of Government could not ſuite with the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this Spiritual Monarchy. For in theſe States
where the Crown is hereditary, it muſt of neceſſity ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
happen, that the ſame is devolved to Princes who
are Minors; and it would be an odd ſight, that a
Child that rides the Hobby-horſe, ſhould be taken for
the Vicar of Chriſt, and that the Protectour of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom
ſhoul want a Tutor. Neither is it to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
that young Princes could behave themſelves ſo
gravely and wiſely, as ſeems to be requiſite for a Perſon
of his ſtation; neither can it as much as be hoped, that
a whole ſucceſſion of Princes ſhould be inclinable to ſuch
a Function. In a word, an hereditary ſucceſſion would
have made it the ſame with a temporal State, which
could never have been maintained long upon ſo awk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
and ſlight a Foundation. For the great Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
themſelves would have been for putting by the
Pope, that they might ſucceed in his ſtead; whereas
theſe ſeeing they cannot poſſeſs themſelves of the Papacy
by open force are now very obedient, in hopes that
either they themſelves or at leaſt their Friends may one
time or another attain to this Dignity by Election.
Beſides this, it might eaſily have happened, that in caſe

but little ſuitable to excite others to a Holy Life and
Devotion. Wherefore it was the main deſign, by a
fained hypocriſy to impoſe a belief upon the People, as
if the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> was ſo wholly taken up with ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Affairs, that there was no room left for worldly
Pleaſures. It was alſo reaſonably ſuppoſed, that a Prince
who had Wife and Children might ſometimes be led
away to take more to heart the private Intereſt of his
Family than the publick Good of the State, ſince there
can ſcarce be any thing more prevailing upon a Man,
than the conſideration of the welfare, and preſervation
of Wife and Children. And what <hi>Alexander</hi> VI. and
<hi>Paul</hi> III. did with their Baſtards, have been convincing
Inſtances of this poſition to the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> It is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
that they alſo rook this into conſideration, that if a
Temporal foreign Prince ſhould obtain this Dignity, he
would entail it upon his Houſe, which inconveniencies
are now avoided by the Obligation which is laid upon
the Pope never to marry.</p>
               <p>The Conclave is alſo a moſt admirable Invention to
bridle the immoderate Ambition,<note place="margin">The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave.</note> and prevent thoſe
Schiſms, which uſed formerly miſerably to afflict the
See and weaken the Authority of the Popes; beſides
that, thereby a long Vacancy of the Chair is prevented,
and by means of this Election, it is much eaſier to pick
out one that is fitly qualified to repreſent the great and
artificial Hypocrite, and afterwards to make the People
believe, that are ignorant of the Intrigues of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave,
that it was by the particular providence of God
Almighty, that ſuch a Perſon was choſen as was the
moſt worthy to be God's Vicar upon Earth. Thus
much at leaſt may be obtained by an Election, that ſuch
a Perſon is choſen as is well verſed in the Arts of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:65650:242"/>
and their ambitious Deſigns, and whoſe Age being
above the folly and extravagancies of young Men, may
by his years and long experience appear more venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in his Function.<note place="margin">What Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications are neceſſary for one that is to be choſen Pope.</note> It is alſo a very wiſe Ordinance
concerning the Election of a Pope, that he is to have
two third parts of the Votes in the Conclave, which
ſeems to have been introduced, that the new Pope might
not be diſpleaſing to a great number of Cardinals. Now
a days it is a general maxim in the choice of a Pope,
to elect an <hi>Italian,</hi> which is not only done becauſe they
rather will beſtow this Dignity and Advantage upon a
Native of <hi>Italy</hi> than upon a Foreigner, but alſo becauſe
the ſecurity and preſervation of the Papal Chair depends
in a great meaſure on the ballance which is to be kept
betwixt <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> which is not to be expected
from a <hi>French</hi> of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Pope, who would quickly turn
the Scale, and by granting too great Prerogatives to his
Country-men, endeavour to exclude others from the
Papal Chair. They alſo chooſe commonly a Pope who
is pretty well in years, but very ſeldom a young one,
that alſo others may be in hopes of attaining the ſame
Dignity, and that a young Pope during a long Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency
may not undertake to alter their Cuſtoms
and Maxims, or to make his Family ſo Rich and
Potent and ſet up ſo many Creatures of his own, as
thereby to entail the Papal Chair upon his Houſe. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
that, in this ſtation where the Pope need not to
go into the Field, there is more occaſion for a grave
antient Man than a vigorous young Perſon. It is alſo
another Maxim among them, to take care that he may
not be too near a Kin to the deceaſed Pope, that the
vacant Church-Benefices may not fall into the Hands
of one Family, and the new Pope may be the ſooner
prevailed upon to amend the Faults of his Predeceſſor.
Laſtly, They are commonly for chooſing ſuch a one as is
neither too much addicted to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> nor the <hi>French</hi>
Intereſt, yet that he be not hated by either of theſe
two parties. Wherefore it is a Cuſtom among them,
that both theſe Crowns give in a Liſt of ſuch Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
as they would have excluded from being elected
Pope. Notwithſtanding all this it often ſo happens,
that one is choſen Pope of whom no body thought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:65650:242"/>
when the Cardinals are tired out by ſo many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues,
and are glad to get out of the Conclave. It is alſo
often obſerved, that a Pope proves quite another Man
after he is come to ſit in the Chair than he was before,
when yet a Cardinal. The Pope at his entring upon the
Government, is not tied to any certain Rules or Capitulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
ſince it would ſeem very unbecoming to controul by
humane Laws and Contracts the Power of him who is
pretended to be endowed with the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>But the College of the Cardinals is as it were the ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Council of the Eccleſiaſtical State,<note place="margin">College of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals.</note> in like manner as
the Chapters of the Cathedrals are to the Biſhops in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</hi>
With thoſe the Pope adviſes concerning Matters
of the greateſt moment; nevertheleſs it often happens
that the Popes and their Nephews make but little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of their Advice, but act as they pleaſe. The
chief Prerogative of the Cardinals conſiſts chiefly in that
they have the Power of chooſing a Pope, and that out
of their own Body, they being ſuppoſed to be the next
to him, and beſt acquainted with the Affairs of the
Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> which is one neceſſary qualification of a
Pope. Their ordinary number is Threeſcore and Ten,
which is ſeldom complete. They now a-days are treated
by the Title of your Eminency, according to a Decree of
Pope <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> VIII. whereas they were formerly called Moſt
Illuſtrious <hi>(Illuſtriſſimi)</hi> which Title was grown very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
in <hi>Italy.</hi> And becauſe the Cardinals had got a new
Title, the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> pretended alſo to be treated by
the Title of your Highneſs <hi>(Altazza)</hi> whereas formerly
they were very well ſatisfied with the Title of your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
<hi>(Excellenza.)</hi> The Election of the Cardinals
depends abſolutely on the Pope's pleaſure, who never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs,
conſtantly takes notice of ſuch as are recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to that Dignity by <hi>France, Spain</hi> and other Princes.
The Paraſites of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> are not aſhamed to
maintain, that the Cardinal's Cap is equal in Dignity
to a Crowned Head, and to this day they pretend to
have the precedency before the Electors of the Empire.</p>

                  <hi>viz.</hi> ſince the
Year 1471. the Popes have made it their Buſineſs to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich
their Families out of the Church Revenues, of
which there are very remarkable Inſtances. For it is
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:65650:243"/>
related that <hi>Sixtus</hi> V. during his Regency of five Years,
did beſtow upon his Family above three Millions of
Ducats; and <hi>Gregory</hi> XV. had in two Years and three
Months, got together the value of three Millions in
Lands, without reckoning what he left in ready
Money. It is reported of the Houſe of the <hi>Barbarini's,</hi>
that at the death of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> VIII. they were poſſeſſed
of 227 Offices and Church-Benefices, moſt of them
reckoned at three, five, eight and ten Thouſand <hi>Seudi</hi> a
piece, whereby it is ſaid, they got together a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of 30 Millions of <hi>Scudi.</hi> This has been repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
as a very ſcandalous thing by ſome, but if duly
conſidered, it is a great folly to ſuppoſe, that ſince the
main intention of the Popiſh Sovereignty is to enrich the
Clergy, the Popes ſhould ſtifle their natural inclination
toward their Kindred, and not make Hay whilſt the
Sun ſhines. This is rather to be look'd upon as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Infirmity, that Favourites and others whilſt they
are Fortunate are envied by others, who are vexed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
Fortune is not ſo favourable to them. Beſides
that, the Revenues of the Church are ſo great, that the
Popes ſince they need not entertain any conſiderable
Army, ſcarce know how to employ them better.</p>
               <p>Since the time of Pope <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> VIII. a Cuſtom has
been introduced, to make one of the Pope's Nephews
Chief Miniſter of the Eccleſiaſtical State, whom they
call Cardinal Patroon <hi>(Cardinal Patrono.)</hi> Among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Reaſons,<note place="margin">Cardinal Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troon.</note> why the Pope commits the management
of Affairs to one of his Nephews, this is alledged for
one; that by reaſon of the nearneſs of Blood, he ought
to be preferred before others, and that by ſo doing,
the Pope's Perſon is better ſecured againſt any attempts
which are ſooner made upon his Life than of other he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary
Princes, whoſe death their Succeſſours are able
to revenge. How fearful the Popes are of Poyſon, may
be judged from thence, that as often as the Pope receives
the Sacrament, his Chaplain who is to adminiſter the
Bread and Wine, is obliged to taſte of both before the
the Pope. It is alſo pretended, that by the Miniſtry of
the Nephews, this Advantage is obtained, that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Miniſters and Governours have not ſo much op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to enrich themſelves, and to put one another
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:65650:243"/>
out of place, which is the common Cuſtom in Elective
States. For their Nephews are few in number, and
therefore ſooner to be ſatisfied; neither will they eaſily
ſuffer that others ſhould enrich themſelves, ſince they are
ſenſible that all the hatred falls upon themſelves. They
are alſo very ſerviceable to the Pope, in that they more
freely can diſcloſe the Intereſts of the ſeveral Princes to
him, than other Miniſters who are not ſo nearly allied to
him, and that they are fain to be more circumſpect
in their management of Affairs, for fear, left they may
one time or another be called to an account; for which
reaſon it is their Buſineſs, ſo to oblige one Prince or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that they may upon all occaſions be ſure of his
Protection. Beſides, that by their Aſſiſtance, Affairs
may be carried on with much more ſecrecy than other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.
And if the Pope were deſtitute of their Counſel,
he would be obliged to have recourſe to the Cardinals,
who moſt commonly are very partial, being moſt of
them engaged to foreign Princes either by Penſions or
Benefices.</p>
               <p>§ 32.<note place="margin">Concerning the Celibacy of the Popiſh Clergy.</note> The Subjects of this Eccleſiaſtical Monarchy
may commodiouſly be divided into two ſeveral ſorts; the
firſt comprehends the whole Clergy, the ſecond all the
reſt of Chriſtendom, as far as the ſame profeſſes the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Catholick Religion, which is commonly called
the Laiety. The firſt may be compared to the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Army of a Prince, who thereby manitains his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts;
the reſt are to be deemed as Subjects that are
Tributaries to the Prince, and are obliged to maintain
thoſe ſtanding Forces at their Charge. The firſt have
this particular Obligation upon them, that they muſt
abſtain from Marriage. This is done under pretence
of a ſpecial Holineſs, and that thereby they may be the
more fit to perform their Duty without any hinderance;
but the true reaſon is, that they ſhould not prefer the
Intereſt and Welfare of their Wife and Children, before
that of the Church, and in conſideration thereof, not
ſide with thoſe Princes under whoſe Juriſdiction they
live, or that they ſhould not enrich their Children with
the Revenues of the Church, but be the more ready up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all occaſions to execu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="436" facs="tcp:65650:244"/>
againſt ſuch Princes, under whoſe Protection they live.
For ſince Wife and Children are eſteemed the deareſt
Pledges, not to be left to the diſcretion of an enraged
Enemy, they could the eaſier deſpiſe the anger of their
Princes, if they had no other Care to take but for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
a ſingle Man not needing to fear a livelihood in
any place whatever. And it has been the main endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
of the Popes to exempt the Clergy by all means
from the Juriſdiction of the Civil Magiſtrates, and to
make them only dependent on himſelf. Beſides this,
the avaricious Clergy would not have made ſo good a
Harveſt if it had been taken for granted among the
People, that the ſame was collected for their Wife and
Children, whereas now it is pretended, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
not for themſelves, but for the maintainance of the
Church. But thoſe who have been ſo buſie to force
Celibacy upon the Clergy, were forgetful in not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing
them at the ſame time a <hi>Recipe</hi> againſt Inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency,
and which they ſeem to ſtand in great need of.
How vaſt a number there is of this ſort of People,<note place="margin">Their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</note> may
be beſt judged out of what is related of Pope <hi>Paul</hi> IV.
who uſed to brag, that he had 228000 Pariſhes, and
44000 Monaſteries under his Juriſdiction, if he did not
miſtake in his account, eſpecially as to the Monaſteries,
The Clergy may again be ſubdivided into two ſorts, <hi>viz.</hi>
thoſe who are bare Prieſts and Eccleſiaſticks, and thoſe
who have engaged themſelves by a particular Vow, <hi>viz.</hi>
the Monks and Jeſuits who are to be eſteemed the Pope's
pretorian Bands. They receive for their pay Honours
and Dignities, great Revenues, a quiet Life, without
any great Labour, and live always near a good Kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin;
but thoſe who have addicted themſelves to a
more ſtrict Order, are fed with the vain belief of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
great Merits and particular Prerogatives above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>

Laiety in Obedience, that he perſuades them to receive

Promoters of their Salvation, and Maſters over their

turn them about according to the Will of the Clergy.
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:65650:244"/>
And that every thing may be accommodated to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
of this Spiritual Monarchy, ſeveral Articles of the
Chriſtian Religion have been by degrees ſtretched or
patched up with new Additions; and any one that will
duly weigh theſe Matters wherein they differ with their
Adverſaries, will ſoon find that in thoſe points there is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
a mixture of Intereſt as to the Authority, Power
and Revenues of the Clergy. Among thoſe in the firſt
place is to be reckoned the Doctrine concerning the
Authority and Power of the Pope, whereby they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to ſet him above Councils, and make him Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible;
which point is ſtretched to the utmoſt by the
Jeſuits, becauſe, if that ſtands faſt, all the reſt is ſoon
proved.<note place="margin">As that of the Pop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>s Power.</note> Wherefore, what has been taught formerly,
and if I am not miſtaken, is taught even to this Day, by
the Doctors of the <hi>Sorbon, viz.</hi> that the Councils are
equal to, or rather above the Pope, is deſtructive to the
very fundamental Conſtitution of the Popiſh Monarchy,
ſince this Doctrine ſmells ſtrongly of a Democracy,
which is directly contrary to a Monarchy. And it is not
eaſily to be reconciled how the Pope who pretends to
have ſuch great Prerogatives above all others, ſhould be
ſubject to the Cenſure of his Cretures and Vaſſals.
For as they will have it, whatſoever either the Holy
Scripture, or the antient Fathers have attributed to the
Church, ought altogether to be applied to the Pope, in
like manner, as what is ſpoken of a whole Kingdom, is
commonly to be underſtood of the King.</p>
               <p>The Laiety has been debarred from reading the Holy
Scripture,<note place="margin">The prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Laietya read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turea.</note> by which means not only the Authority of
the Clergy is maintained among the People, as if the
Prieſts were the only Men that have a privilege to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
to the Divine Oracles; but alſo the Laiety is
thereby prevented from finding out thoſe points in the
Scripture which are repugnant to the Intereſt of the
Clergy: For if the People ſhould once get a true Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
of the Scripture, they would not be ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to follow ſo blindly the Inſtructions of the Prieſts.
They alſo by this means prevent the Laiety from diving
too deeply into Divinity, which they pretend belongs
only to the Clergy; and for this reaſon it is that they
attribute the Power of explaining the Scripture to the
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:65650:245"/>
Pope only, that nothing may be brought to light, which
may in any ways be prejudicial to the ſpiritual Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy.
For the ſame reaſon the Pope pretends to
have the ſole Authority of deciding all Controverſies
whatſoever.</p>
               <p>It is alſo given out among the People,<note place="margin">Traditions.</note> that the Holy
Scripture is imperfect, which muſt be explained by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Traditions; whereby they gain this point<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that if
they invent any Doctrine for the Intereſt of the ſpiritual
State, whereof there is not the leaſt footſteps to be
found in the Holy Scripture, they without any other
proof, may only have recourſe to the antient Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</p>
               <p>The diſtinction betwixt Venial and Mortal Sins,<note place="margin">Venial and Mortal Sins.</note> as

of Books of Confeſſion, enough to fraight whole
Fleets withal, is not publiſhed with an intention to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
Vices, but that by laying a Tax upon the ſame,
the Clergy may the better be able to maintain their
Grandeur, and ſatisfie their Avarice. The moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
Doctrine of remiſſion of Sins, has wholly been
accommodated to the Intereſt of the Clergy.<note place="margin">Penance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> For, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it would not have turned to the profit of the
Clergy, if every one who truly repented ſhould obtain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of his Sins, only by Faith in the Merits of Chriſt;
it has been the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that
it was an eſſential piece of penitence, and the means to
obtain forgiveneſs of Sins, if a moſt exact and preciſe
account of every individual Sin committed was given
to the Prieſt. By which means, they not only keep the
People under their Devotion, and make ſuch impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
upon them as are fitting for their purpoſe; but
they alſo come thereby to the knowledge of all Secrets,
Counſels, Deſigns and Inclinations of the People, which
they make good uſe of for their benefit; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
that they are under an obligation not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal
any thing that is told them by way of Confeſſion;
for, elſe it would be impoſſible for them to perſuade
the People to act againſt the natural Inclination of all
Mankind. The Prieſt has alſo a Power to command
works of ſatisfaction to be done, whereby he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:65650:245"/>
has his good ſhare. For tho' certain Prayers, Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimages,
Faſts, Flagellations and the like, are often im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
upon them for Penances, yet they alſo very often
condemn ſome, and eſpecially the richer ſort in a good
ſum of Money, to be given inſtead of a Penance to a
certain Monaſtery, Church or the Poor, among whom
are the Mendicant-Fryars. Theſe honeſt Fellows call
themſelves <hi>minimos fratrum,</hi> according to the 25. Chap.
of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> that they may have a fair ſhining pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
to fill their Purſes. For by this Interpretation, the
Chriſtains have got this benefit, that they are obliged
to feed and maintain 100000 lazy, idle Fellows. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
this, the firſt ſort of Penance may be redeemed
with Money, if you think it too hard to be performed.
And who that is wealthy, would not be civil and libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
towards his Father-Confeſſour, to oblige him to a
mitigation of the Penance or becauſe he has already
ſhewed himſelf favourable before?</p>
               <p>Why good Works have been made meritorious and
the means of obtaining Salvation from God Almighty,<note place="margin">Merit of good Works.</note> is
eaſily to be gueſſed. For when they were to give a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition
of good Works, they were ſure to put in the
firſt place, that the Pople ought to be liberal towards
the Clergy, Churches and Monaſteries, and to perform
every thing which is commanded them by the Pope and
his adherents, tho' never ſo full of Superſtition and Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy.
Neither muſt this be forgot, that they alſo
have taught, that the Monks are not only able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
good Works ſufficient for themſelves, but that alſo
they have an overplus of Merits which they can fell to
the Laiety. And out of this overplus, they have laid
up an inexhauſtible ſtore very profitable to the Clergy,
which coſts them nothing, which does not grow muſty
nor ever decays, and which cannot be returned upon
their hands, when the Buyer finds out the Cheat.</p>
               <p>Their Religious Exerciſes are ſo full of Ceremonies,<note place="margin">Ceremonies,</note>
ſo many ſuperfluous Feaſts and Proceſſions are inſtituted
ſo many Chapels are Altars erected only to employ ſo
great a number of Clergymen, who elſe would appear
like ſo many idle Fellows, whereas now it turns all to
their profit; which is alſo the reaſon why they have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
the number of Sacraments of ſeven, ſince they
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:65650:246"/>
know that none of them can be adminiſtred, but the
Prieſt gets by it. The Maſs without Communicants
has been introduced and proclaimed a Sacrifice both for
the dead and the living, that they might have an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to put both the dead and the living under Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution.
For no body undertakes any thing of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but he has a Maſs ſung firſt, for the good ſucceſs
of the thing in hand. No body of wealth dyes, but he
orders a good ſtore of Maſſes to be ſung for his Soul, all
which brings griſt to the Prieſt's Mill.</p>
               <p>On the other hand,<note place="margin">Half Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</note> after it once was become an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe,
that the Laiety did receive the Sacrament with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
partaking of the Cup, it was made into a Law.
And tho' the contrary was very evident both by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of Chriſt, and the practice of the Church for
a great many Centuries, yet did they perſiſt with great
obſtinacy, becauſe it ſhould not ſeem that the Clergy had
committed an Errour; and alſo that they might have a
Prerogative before the Laiety in this Sacrament. And
to ridicule the more impudently both God and Men,
they give to the Laiety a Chalice which is not conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
which in very deſpicable Terms they call the rin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
Chalices, as People when they have eaten any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanly
thing, uſe to rinſe their Mouths.</p>
               <p>Marriage alſo was to be made a Sacrament,<note place="margin">Marriage made a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</note> tho' no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is more abſurd, that the Clergy might have an
opportunity to draw all matrimonial Cauſes under their

and of the greateſt Conſequence, ſince the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare,
inheritance and ſucceſſion of moſt People, nay,
even of whole Kingdoms depend thereon. This obliged
<hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>England</hi> to endeavour the re-eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Popery in that Kingdom; for without the
Pope's Authority, ſhe muſt have paſſed for a Baſtard.
And <hi>Philip</hi> III. King of <hi>Spain</hi> was among other reaſons
obliged to the Pope, becauſe he had given Diſpenſation
to his Father to marry his own Siſter's Daughter, of
whom <hi>Philip</hi> was born, which Marriage would not
eaſily have been approved by other Chriſtians. There
were alſo ſo many prohibited degrees introduced on

by their interceſſion and a good number of Maſſes to
get the ſooner out of this hot place. The Veneration
paid to the Reliques,<note place="margin">Reliques<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Prayers to Saints.</note> has alſo been very beneficial to
the Clergy; theſe are employed, beſides other uſes, to
reward people of Quality, that have done great ſervices to
the Pope, with a piece of an old Bone in lieu of a better
preſent. The Adoration of the Saints ſerves for a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text
to build the more Churches, inſtitute more Feaſts
and employ and feed a greater number of Prieſts. The
power, which the Pope has aſſumed of Canonization,
gives him a conſiderable authority among the People, as
if it were his prerogative to beſtow Dignities and Offices
upon whom he thinks fit, even in Heaven, and that
God Almighty cannot but accept of ſuch Referendaries,
as the Pope is pleaſed to repreſent to him. By this
means he makes himſelf Maſter of the Inclinations of
the People though living in far diſtant places, unto
whom he propoſes this as a Recompenſe of their
Credulity and Ambition, if they ſtick at nothing
to promote his Intereſt. And ever ſince this Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition
has taken root in Chriſtendom, thoſe who
have been Canonized have for the moſt part been
Clergymen, who either by a new invented Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie,
or outward appearance of Holineſs had made
themſelves famous in the World. Or if by chance one
Layman or another has attained to this Dignity, either
he himſelf, or at leaſt thoſe that interceeded for him,
have been fain to deſerve very well of the Papal Chair.
Not to mention here, in what manner they by fictiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Miracles, ſeveral ſorts of Images, Apparitions, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orciſms,

§.<note place="margin">The Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities have promoted the Popiſh Sovereignty.</note> 34. Next to what has been ſaid, the Univerſities,
which have partly been Inſtituted by the Popes Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
partly by other States, yet ſo that moſt of them
have been Confirmed by the Popes, who alſo have
claimed the Supreme Direction over the ſome, have
been mainly inſtrumental in maintaining the Popiſh So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty.
It is evident enough of what Conſequence
this Direction muſt needs be to the Pope. For, ſince
in the Univerſities Men are firſt imbued with ſuch
Opinions, as they afterwards are to make uſe of
during their whole Life, and inſtil them into others,
the Univerſities, and Sciences there to be taught
were to be ſure to be accommodated to the Popes
Intereſt. Neither were the Profeſſours of Divinity
here, who claimed the Precedency before all others,
the only Creatures of the Pope, but alſo the Profeſſours
of the Canon Law, who were as buſie as any to put
his Decrees upon the World, and to maintain his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.
For the World may thank the Canon-Law
for the firſt Introduction of thoſe long Law Suits, which
the Clergy pretended to belong to their Juriſdiction, that
by receiving of Bribes they might the ſooner ſatisfie
their Avarice. The greateſt-part of the Philoſophers
were alſo the Popes Slaves, and if one or another at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
to inveſtigate the true cauſes of Things, he
was ſure to be kept under by all the reſt. The Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and Philoſophy which was profeſſed in theſe Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities
were not taught with an intention to make
the young Students more learned and underſtanding,
but that the ingenious by theſe confuſed and idle terms
might be diverted from throughly inveſtigating thoſe
matters which would have led them to the whole diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of the Popiſh Intreagues. For their Scholaſtick
Divinity is not employed in ſearching and explaining
the Holy Scripture, but for the moſt part entangled in
uſeleſs queſtions, invented chiefly by <hi>Peter Lombard,
Thomas Aquinas, Scotus,</hi> and the other Patriarchs of
Pedantry. And what they call Philoſophy is nothing
elſe but a Collection of fooliſh Chimer's, empty Terms,
and very bad Latin, the knowledge of which is rather
hurtful than profitable, if you have not been better In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:65650:247"/>
otherwiſe. So that all what they pretended
to, was to take care that the Sciences might not be
fundamentally taught to the Students. With theſe
Trumperies the Univerſities were not only over-run
during the former barbarous times, but even continue
to this very day; and tho moſt Sciences are ſo much
improved, the old Leaven is with great Induſtry pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
and propagated: on the contrary all the ſolid
Science, eſpecially ſuch, as are Inſtrumental in diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
the Vulgar Errors of the World are ſuppreſſed.
Above all the reſt, the moſt uſeful of all, Doctrine
of Morality is much miſinterpreted and entangled in
an endleſs Labyrinth, that the Fathers Confeſſours may
not want means to domineer over the Laymens Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
and to entangle them with ſo many dubious and
double meaning inſinuations, that they are thereby ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
incapable to examin and rule their Actions, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to ſolid Principles, but are obliged to be
guided blindfold according to the pleaſure of their
Fathers Confeſſours.</p>
               <p>§.<note place="margin">Why the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits have taken upon them the Education of the Youth.</note> 35. But, becauſe Learning had given the main
blow to the Pope, at the time of <hi>Luther</hi>'s Reformation,
the Jeſuits, who may well be called the Popes Guard
<hi>du</hi> Corps, have afterwards taken upon them the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Youth; for they not only teach publickly
in the Univerſities, but they have alſo engroſſed to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
the Inſtruction of the Youth in the Schools, that
they might have all the opportunity ſo to guide and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
them in their Studies, that they might not only not
prove prejudicial, but rather advantageous to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Darkneſs. For by this way of managing the
Youth they have not only acquired vaſt Riches and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to their Order, but alſo have been very inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
in maintaing the Popiſh Monarchy, which they
are bound to do by a particlar Vow above all the other
Monks. They make it their buſineſs to imprint into the
tender minds of the Youth a Veneration for the Pope,
and ſo to guide their inclinations as they think it
moſt profitable to the State of the Church. They uſe
the young people from their infancy to perſiſt obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
in their conceived Opinions, and that no Reaſons
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:65650:248"/>
ought to prevail againſt them, whereby they render them
incapable of ever attaining the knowledge of Truth.
They have alſo an opportunity throughly to inveſtigate
and diſcover the Capacities and Inclinations of their
Diſciples, which they make good uſe of to their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
whenever theſe are imployed in State Affairs.
But ſuch as they find of an extraordinary Capacity or
abounding in Wealth, they endeavour by all means to
draw into their Order. So that the main intention of
their School Diſcipline which is ſo famous throughout
the World, is, to uphold the Pope's Sovereignty. They
boaſt of extraordinary methods to teach the Latin
Tongue to young people, but they take a particular
care, that they do not let their Diſciples grow too wiſe,
except ſuch as are to be received into their Order. And,
becauſe, they have by this management of the Youths
brought a great many able Men over to their Order,
and are beſides this very gentile and civil in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
(in which point they are far above all the other
Monks, who are moſt of them full of Incivility and
Pedantry) they have found means, under pretence of
being Confeſſours, to creep into moſt Courts, and
to inſinuate themſelves into the very Secrets of the
State; ſo that in a great many Courts they have the
greateſt ſway in the Councils; And there you may be
ſure they will never be forgetful of the Popes and their
own Intereſt. Nevertheleſs by their inſatiable Avarice,
and forwardneſs of medling in all Affairs they have made
themſelves odious in ſome places; And becauſe the
Jeſuits have treſpaſſed upon the Authority and advant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages
of the other Monks, who are of more antient
Orders, theſe are grown jealous of them to the higheſt
degree.</p>
               <p>Neither ought it to be paſſed by in ſilence,<note place="margin">Licenſing of Books.</note> that the
Pope and his adherents pretend to have a right of Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring
and Licenſing all Books whatſoever, whereby
they may eaſily prevent that nothing may come to light,
which might prove prejudicial to them. And in Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring
of Books they are ſo impudent as not only to
ſtrike out of the antient Authors, when the ſame are
to be reprinted, at pleaſure, ſuch paſſages as they diſlike,
but alſo they do not ſtick to inſert ſuch new paſſages
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:65650:248"/>
as are ſuitable to their intentions. If any Book is to be
publiſhed in their Territories firſt the ſame is exactly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed
and corrected. And if it ſhould happen by chance,
that ſomething ſhould be overſeen in the firſt Edition
which does not ſuit with their Intereſt, it is marked in
an Index made for that purpoſe, that it may be omitted
in the next Edition. But the Books of their Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
are prohibited, nay the reading of them is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
but to ſome particular perſons, and that not
without ſpecial leave, and theſe are ſuch as they know
to be thorough-paced and intirely devoted to their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt.
By ſo doing they may lay to their Adverſaries
charge what they pleaſe, ſince their Subjects never get
ſight of the others Refutation. It has been a general
obſervation, that ſince the ſcandalous life of the Monks
had not only been very prejudicial to the Popiſh Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,
but alſo that the Proteſtants had ſet out their
Vices in their natural colours; The Papiſts have beſpat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
the Proteſtant Miniſters with the ſame Vices as they
were charged withal, and have not only repreſented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the
infirmities of ſome particular perſons to the World,
but alſo have laid to their charge the moſt heinous
crimes they could invent; and afterwards have challenged
their Adverſaries to prove the contrary; which Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
have ſuch influence, at leaſt upon the ſimple and
common ſort of People, that it gives them a great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
to the Proteſtants. They alſo do not want im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence
to ſet out at a high rate their Miracles, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdoms
and other great Feats, which generally are
tranſacted in far diſtant Countries; by which means
they gain a great Credit at leaſt by the inconſiderate
multitude. Among others <hi>Edwin Sandys</hi> an <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Knight has diſcovered abundance of theſe tricks in his
Treatiſe concerning the State of Religion.</p>

Emperours and Kings to come and creep to the Croſs.

is counted the worſt ſort of Hereſie, if any one attempts
any thing againſt the Popiſh Law and Doctrine, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Pope's Authority. This ſerves for a Bridle to
curb the People withal, and to the Inhabitants of thoſe
Countries is as terrible as the Plague, ſince matters are
tranſacted with ſo much ſeverity in this Court, that
ſcarce any body, that falls under the Inquiſition, eſcapes
their hands without conſiderable loſs.</p>

of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, together with their

And beſides this, the Popiſh Clergy know how to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
their Affairs with that dexterity as to give ſome ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
to every one; ſo that I am apt to believe, that
a great many, who live under the Popiſh ſubjection, are
verily perſuaded, to believe, what the Prieſts tell them,
to be real, ſince they want means and opportunity of
being better inſtructed; Nevertheleſs it is very probable
that a great many of the more learned and wiſes ſort
are ſufficiently convinced, in what manner things are
carried on among them, and that therefore it is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of ſame particular conſiderations, that they do not
free themſelves from this Yoke. I am apt to believe,
that moſt are kept back, becauſe they do not ſee how to
remedy this Evil; And yet they are unwilling to ruin
their Fortunes by going over to the Proteſtant ſide,
where they are not likely to meet with ſo plentiful a
ſhare. Theſe Temptations are not eaſily to be reſiſted,
wherefore they think it ſufficient for the obtaining of
Salvation if they believe in Jeſus Chriſt and truſt upon
his Merits, but for the reſt think it of no great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
if in ſome matters, which are the inventions of
Prieſts, they by conforming themſelves play the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite,
and believe as much concerning them as is ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
with their Opinions. They ſuppoſe it to be of no
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:65650:249"/>
great conſequence, that perhaps the Female Sex and
the vulgar ſort of People that are always fond of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancies,
do believe theſe things in good earneſt. There
are alſo, queſtionleſs, not a few, who not having ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Capacity to diſtinguiſh betwixt ſuch Points in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
as are commanded by God, and betwixt ſuch as
are invented by the Clergy for private Ends, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
coming afterwards to the knowledge of ſome of
theſe deceits, they take all the reſt for fabulous Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
only covering their Atheiſtical Principles with an
outward decent behaviour to ſave themſelves the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of being queſtioned and diſturbed. Every Man of
Senſe may without difficulty imagine how eaſily a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<hi>Italian</hi> or <hi>Spaniard,</hi> that never has read the Bible
or any other Proteſtant Book may fall into this Errour,
if he once has had an opportunity to take notice of the
Intrigues of the Clergy; tho' it is certain, that ſince the
Reformation of <hi>Luther,</hi> the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has changed
her Habit, and her Garment appears far more decent
than before. But beſides this, there are a great many
Perſons of Quality as well as of a meaner Condition,
who make their advantage of the Romiſh Religion,
where they have an opportunity to provide for their
Friends, by putting them either into ſome Order or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Knighthood, or into that of Monks, or other
Eccleſiaſticks, by which means a great many Families
are eaſed of a great Charge, and ſometimes are raiſed
by it. At leaſt the ſuperſtitious Parents are well ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
when they ſee their Children are become ſuch Saints:
And thoſe that cannot make their Fortunes otherwiſe,
run into a Monaſtery, where they are ſure to be provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

if the Popiſh Monarchy ſhould fall, and the Church Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues
were applyed to the uſe of the State. The Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh

where it now rides triumphant, that if any of their

it a very difficult Task, ſince the Prieſts would be for

firm to the Popiſh Intereſt in <hi>Germany,</hi> ſince they
find it more advantageous to be great Princes than

any better treatment if the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy had
been brought to perfection; as either of them muſt

               <p>It may therefore be taken for granted that one of the
main Pillars of the Popiſh Monarchy is the jealouſy and
ballance,<note place="margin">The main Pillar of the Popiſh Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy.</note> which is to be kept up betwixt theſe two
Crowns; and that it is the Pope's Intereſt, as much as
in him lies, to take care that one of theſe Crowns do
not ruin the other, and ſet up for an univerſal Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy.
If we look into the tranſactions of former times,
we ſhall find that the Popes have long ſince obſerved this
Maxim. 'Tis true, after the death of King <hi>Henry</hi> II.
when <hi>France</hi> was extreamly weakned, the Popes were
forced to be good <hi>Spaniſh</hi> whether they would or no,
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> having then found out the way to oblige
them to it by fair or foul means. They knew how to
influence the Popes by their Nephews, who were for
ſetling and enriching their Families, whileſt their Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
were alive. Thoſe they brought over to their
party by granting to them Penſions, Church-Benefices,
large Poſſeſſions, great Offices and advantageous Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;
who in acknowledgement of the ſame uſed often
to make the Pope good <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> even againſt his inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
but if they reſiſted theſe temprations, they uſed to
proſecute theſe Nephews with a vengeance, after the
Pope's deceaſe. And it was their conſtant practice in
thoſe days, to exclude ſuch from the Papal Chair, as
they thought were bent againſt their Intereſt. But as
ſoon as <hi>France</hi> began to recover its Strength, the Popes
managed themſelves with more indifferency, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
no more favour to either ſide, than they thought was
ſuiting with their preſent Circumſtances. It is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
that the Jeſuit <hi>Guicardus</hi> in a Sermon preached in
<hi>Paris</hi> in the 1637. in the Month of <hi>July,</hi> did ſay, that
the War which the then King of <hi>France</hi> waged againſt
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:65650:252"/>
the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> was to be deemed a Holy War, carried
on for the preſervation of the Holy Religion. For if
the King of <hi>France</hi> had not taken up Arms, the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
deſigns were ſo laid, as to make the Pope an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moner
to the King of <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>

                     </gap>lination towards the Proteſtants.</note> But as to thoſe who have withdrawn themſelves
from the Pope's Obedience, it is certain the Pope would
be glad, if they could be reduced to his Obedience, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
it might be done by ſuch means, that thereby one
party were not ſo much ſtrengthened as to become ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
to all <hi>Europe.</hi> For it is better to let my Enemy
live, than to kill me and my Enemy at one ſtroke. It
was for this reaſon, that we read that Pope <hi>Paul</hi> III. was
vexed to the heart at the ſtupendous Succeſs of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<hi>Charles</hi> V. againſt the Proteſtants, which made
him recall his Troops that were ſent to his Aſſiſtance.
And if <hi>Philip</hi> II. had been ſucceſsful in his expedition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>England, Sixtus</hi> V. would queſtionleſs have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
his Errour of aſſiſting him in this Enterpriſe.
So <hi>Gregory</hi> XV. during the Differences betwixt thoſe of
the <hi>Valtelins</hi> and the <hi>Griſons</hi> ſided with the laſt, the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
againſt <hi>Spain.</hi> Neither was <hi>

at the Succeſs of <hi>Guſtavus Adolphus</hi> againſt the
Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> eſpecially ſince the latter had given
much about the ſame time an evident inſtance to the
World, as to the buſineſs of <hi>Mantua,</hi> that they uſed to
give no better treatment to Roman Catholicks than Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants.
Some have remarked, that when <hi>Ferdinand</hi> II.
did deſire ſome Subſidies from the Popes, which he had
promiſed before, the Pope ſent him plenary Indulgences
for him and his whole Army at the point of death, that
they might be prepared to dye with the more Courage.
And ſome Years ago, the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> was no leſs
concerned at the then prodigious Succeſs of <hi>France</hi> in
<hi>Holland,</hi> when this State ſeemed to be reduced to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
extremity. But the chief aim of the Pope is, to
reduce by all manner of Artifices the Proteſtants to his
Obedience. To obtain this end, he ſets the Proteſtants
together by the Ears, flattereth the Proteſtant Princes,
and takes care that many of them may marry Roman
Catholick Ladies; the younger Brothers out of the
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:65650:252"/>
greateſt Families he obliges to come over to his Party,
by beſtowing upon them great Dignities and Church-Benefices,
all that will come over to his ſide are kindly
received and very well uſed, neither do they write ſo
much againſt the Proteſtant Divines, but rather endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to ſet up and maintain Controverſies among them.
By theſe Artifices the Popiſh Clergy had got very viſible
advantages in this Age over the Proteſtants, and are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to get more every day, ſince they ſee with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
ſatisfaction that their Adverſaries do weaken them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
by their inteſtine Quarrels and Diviſions.</p>
               <p>§ 40. From what has been ſaid it is eaſily to be
judged,<note place="margin">No Peace is to be exſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted betwixt the Roman Catholicks and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants.</note> whether thoſe Differences which are on foot
betwixt the Roman Catholicks and the Proteſtants may
be amicably compoſed, either ſo that both Parties ſhould
remit ſomething of their pretenſions, and agree to one and
the ſame Confeſſion of Faith, leaving ſome by-Queſtions
to be ventilated in the Univerſities; or ſo that both
Parties may retain their Opinions, and yet, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
this Difference, might treat one another like
Brethren in Chriſt and Members of the ſame Church.
Now if we duly weigh the Circumſtances of the matter,
and the Popiſh Principles, ſuch a Peace is to be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
abſolutely impoſſible; ſince the Difference does not
only conſiſt in the Doctrine, but both Intereſts are abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
contrary to one another. For firſt the Pope is for
having the Church-Poſſeſſions reſtored; but the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
are reſolved to keep them in their poſſeſſion. The
Pope pretends to be the ſupreme Head of Chriſtendom, but
the Proteſtants States will not part with their Prerogative
of having their Direction <hi>circa Sacra,</hi> which they look
upon as a precious Jewel belonging to their Sovereignty.
And to pretend to live in Communion and Amity with
the Pope, and not to acknowledge his Sovereignty in
Eccleſiaſtical Affairs, is an abſolute contradiction. In
the ſame manner, as if I would be called a Subject
in a Kingdom, and yet refuſe to acknowledge the King's
Authority. Beſides this, the infallibility of the Pope is
the Foundation Stone of the Popiſh Sovereignty, and if
that is once removed, the whole Structure muſt needs
fall, wherefore it is impoſſible for the Pope, and that for
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:65650:253"/>
reaſons of State, to abate any thing from his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
wherein he differs from the Proteſtants. For if it ſhould
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e once granted that the Pope had hitherto maintained
but one ſingle erroneous point, his infallibility would
them fall to the ground; ſince, if he has erred in one
point, he may be erroneous in others alſo. But if the
Proteſtants ſhould allow the Pope's infallibility, they a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
the ſame time muſt deny their whole Doctrine. And it
ſeems not probable that the Proteſtants can ever be
brought to contradict and at once to recal their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
concerning the vanity of the Popiſh Tenets. Nay,
if it might be ſuppoſed that the Laiety ſhould do it, what
muſt become of the Clergy? Where will they beſtow
their Wives and Children? Wherefore, how good ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the intention may have been of thoſe that have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
a way of accommodation betwixt the Papiſts and
Proteſtants, which is commonly called Syncretiſm, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Inventions, which are ridiculed by the Papiſts; who
in the mean while are well ſatisfied to ſee that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Divines beſtow their labour in vain as to this
point, ſince they (the Papiſts) are no looſers, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the gainers by it. For this Syncretiſm does not
only raiſe great Animoſities among the Proteſtants, but
alſo does not a little weaken their Zeal againſt the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
Religion: It is eaſy to be imagined, that ſome, who
do not thoroughly underſtand the Differences, and hear
the Divines talk of an accommodation betwixt both Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions,
are apt to perſwade themſelves, that the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
does not lie in the fundamental points; and if in
the mean while they meet with an advantageous proffer
from the Roman Catholicks, are ſometimes without great
difficulty prevailed upon to bid farewel to the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Religion. It is taken for a general Rule, that a

of the Roman Catholick Communion that live under
the Juriſdiction of the Proteſtant States; all which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to my computation make up two thirds of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</hi>
There are alſo a great many Papiſts in <hi>Holland,</hi>
neither is <hi>England</hi> quite free of them. But of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
ſide are <hi>England, Sweden, Denmark, Holland,</hi> moſt of
the Secular Electors and Princes, and the Imperial Cities
in <hi>Germany.</hi> The <hi>Hugonots</hi> in <hi>France</hi> are without ſtrength,

the free exerciſe of their Religion; neither is <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania</hi>
powerful enough to give any conſiderable Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance

this Advantage above the Proteſtants, that they all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
the Pope for the ſupreme Head of their
Church, and at leaſt to outward appearance, are unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
in their Faith; whereas on the contrary, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
are not joined under one viſible ſpiritual Head,
but are miſerably divided among themſelves.<note place="margin">Diviſions of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants.</note> For not
to mention here thoſe Sects of leſſer note, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,

is divided into two Parties, of very near equal Strength,
<hi>viz.</hi> into the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and thoſe of the Reformed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
a great many of which are ſo exaſperated againſt
one another, that they could not be more againſt the

               <p>Neither are the Proteſtants united under one Church-Government
or Liturgy,<note place="margin">Other Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies.</note> but each of theſe States regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
the ſame according as they think ſit. Neither can
it be denied, but that the Roman Catholick Clergy in
general is more zealous and induſtrious in propagating
their Religion than the Proteſtants; a great many of
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:65650:254"/>
theſe making no other uſe the Church-Benefices, than
to maintain themſelves out of them, juſt as if it were a
meer Trade; and the propagating of the Chriſtian Faith,
is the leaſt of their Care, or at leaſt only their by-work.
Whereas the Monks and Jeſuits gain great applauſe by
their Miſſions in the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Indies;</hi> and tho
perhaps they brag more than is true of their great Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
there, yet is this Inſtitution in the main very praiſe-worthy.
Beſides this, there is ſuch an implacable jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy
betwixt ſome of the Proteſtant States, that it is not
probable that they will be one and all againſt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts:
not to mention others here, ſuch a jealouſy is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>Denmark.</hi> as likewiſe betwixt <hi>England</hi>

a jealouſy betwixt <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> which will always
be an obſtacle to any union betwixt theſe two Crowns
againſt the Proteſtants. So that notwithſtanding the
unequality betwixt the Papiſts and Proteſtants, theſe need
not fear the Pope's Power.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs, there is a great difference to be made as
to thoſe Proteſtants,<note place="margin">

of a Roman Catholick Prince, the latter of
which are not ſo very well aſſured of the free enjoyment
of their Religion. For the <hi>Hugonoes</hi> in <hi>France</hi> have no

of <hi>Nantes,</hi> which would ſtand them but in little ſtead,
if the King of <hi>France</hi> ſhould be overcome with a Zeal
like to that of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> or the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria.</hi>
Yet does it not ſeem probable to me, that the King of
<hi>France</hi> ſhould eaſily pretend to force them to another
Religion, as long as they are quiet; ſince he ought to
conſider what great Services the <hi>Hugonots</hi> have done to
<hi>Henry</hi> IV. without whoſe Aſſiſtance he would in all

               <p>The Proteſtants in <hi>Germany</hi> are ſo conſiderable,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Of</hi> Germany.</note> that
they may be eſteemed equal in ſtrength to a Kingdom.
But their being divided under ſeveral Heads, and that
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:65650:254"/>
of a different Intereſt, much abates their ſtrength. And
the Emperours within the ſpace of a hundred Years, have
twice reduced them to that extremity, that both their
Religion and Liberty (which are ſo link'd together,
that one cannot be loſt without the other) ſeemed to be
near gone, if <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Sweden</hi> had not prevented it.
'Tis true, there has of late Years a new Maxim been
ſet up, <hi>viz</hi> that the Proteſtants of <hi>Germany</hi> are now in
a capacity to maintain themſelves without the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of the two above-mentioned Crowns, and that
the Elector of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> is the moſt fitly qualified to
be their Head, and to have the Direction among them:
And as it is the Intereſt of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
them in this belief, ſo <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> and <hi>Luneburgh</hi>
make uſe of this ſuppoſition to cover their deſigns of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
into their poſſeſſion thoſe Provinces, that were
given to <hi>Sweden</hi> as a recompence for having been ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental
in preſerving the Religion and Liberty of
the Proteſtants of <hi>Germany.</hi> But ſuppoſe they ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs
their Deſign, it is moſt certain that thoſe two Houſes
by the addition of thoſe Countries, would be much leſs
formidable to the Emperour, than they were at that
time when they were upheld by <hi>Sweden.</hi> And it is a
great miſtake if they perſwade themſelves that what aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
they may exſpect from <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi>
can countervail what they had from <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</hi>
If the Emperour ſhould obtain his Ends and drive
thoſe two Nations out of <hi>Germany,</hi> and reſtore the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi>
Intereſt, and then tire out the Eſtates by ſending
great Armies againſt them, it would be a queſtion who
would be able to oblige the Emperour in ſuch a caſe to
disband his victorious Forces? Or whether the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours
might not under ſome pretence or another keep
his Army on foot, and oblige the States to provide for
them in their Territories? Whether <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> and
<hi>Lunenbuhgh</hi> would be able alone to oppoſe the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour's
deſign? But if the Proteſtant Eſtates ſhould find
themſelves not ſtrong enough to reſiſt his Power, it
would be the Queſtion whether theſe Crowns would
be immediately ready at their demands, or whether
the circumſtances of their Affairs would be ſuch, as to
be able to undertake ſuch a task? Or whether at the time
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:65650:255"/>
of imminent danger ſuch a one as <hi>Guſtaous Adolfus,</hi>
would be ſent down from Heaven, who could act with
the ſame Fortune and Succeſs. For he that believes,
that the Religion is ſufficiently ſecured by Seals and
Deeds, or that the Emperours have laid aſide all thoughts
of making themſelves Sovereigns of <hi>Germany,</hi> if an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
ſhould preſent it ſelf, eſpecially ſince Religion,
and the recovery of the Church poſſeſſions furniſhes
them with ſo ſpecious a pretence, muſt needs have loſt
the memory of all paſt tranſactions. But the laſt Peace
made at <hi>Nimmeguen</hi> has ſufficiently convinced the
World, that theſe deſigns could not be put in executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Thoſe Proteſtant States therefore that are Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
on other Princes need not fear the power of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks. For, as two States that are of the
ſame Religion, nevertheleſs differ in State Intereſts, and
are jealous of one another, which is plainly to be ſeen
betwixt <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> and betwixt <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Holland;</hi> ſo, though States are of a different Religion,
it is not from hence to be concluded, that if a Potent
Prince of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Perſuaſion ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
to ruin a Proteſtant State, the other <hi>Roman</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
States would not prevent it, if it was for their
Intereſt to ſee that Proteſtant State preſerved.</p>
               <p>The beſt way then to preſerve the Proteſtant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

as the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks are obliged to make
uſe of, but only by plain and ſimple means. One of the
main Points is, that both the Churches and Schools
may be provided with perſons fitly qualified for that
purpoſe; That the Clergy by their wholeſome Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine

That the people in general, but more eſpecially ſuch as

thereby they may be proof againſt the Temptations of

peruſe the Writings of both Parties without partiality
cannot but admire, how their Authors are often obliged
to rack themſelves, that they may maintain their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
whether they be conſonant to the Scriptures or
not: As likewiſe how they bring to light again the old
Arguments, which have been refuced a thouſand times
before. Neither will this do the buſineſs, if one Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
ſhould be ſuppoſed as good as the other; ſince ſuch
an indifferency would be a ſhrewd ſign, that the whole
muſt needs be very indifferent to us. Neither can we
without danger declare ſome Points, in which we dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
problematical, ſince I do not ſee how we can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to have a power to declare a certain Article ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
neceſſary or Fundamental, or problematical. Some
therefore have thought upon this expedient, to make a
tryal, whether out of the Articles, wherein both Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
agree could be Compoſed a perfect Syſteme of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,
which might be linked together like one Chain,
according to Art. If this could be effected, though
ſome different Opinions remained, as long as this Chain
was kept entire, we might be aſſured that we did not
differ in the Fundamental Points neceſſary to the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Salvation; and what remained undecided would
not be of ſuch Conſequence as to hinder us from being
united into one Body or Church. But before a true
Judgment can be given of this Propoſition, it would
be requiſite that ſuch a Syſteme compoſed according
to Art, were propoſed to the World. For my part I know
no better advice, than to leave it to the direction of
God Almighty, who perhaps one time or another will
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:65650:256"/>
put us in the way of finding out a good Expedient.
For untimely remedies may prove the occaſion of new
Diviſions. In the mean while it behoves both Parties
notwithſtanding theſe differences to be mindful of their
joint Intereſt againſt their Common Enemy, ſince they
may verily believe that the Pope has no more kindneſs
for the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> than for thoſe of the Reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
               <p>But as for the other Sects of leſs note,<note place="margin">Socinians and Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts.</note> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> The
Socinians, Anabaptiſts, and ſuch like, it is evident that
their Principles cannot poſſibly be reconciled with our
Religion; For thoſe who adhere to the firſt, do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
the Chriſtain Doctrine otherwiſe than a Moral
Philoſophy, and the latter ſcarce know what to believe
themſelves. Beſides this, the Anabaptiſts have hatched
out I know not what rules of Policy, which, if not
ſuppreſſed in time, muſt prove deſtructive to the State.
But whether the Socinians alſo have any ſuch projects in
their Heads, I am not able to determine, ſince hitherto
they have not been powerful enough to raiſe any diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances
in the State.</p>

in <hi>Sweden</hi> called the <hi>Tolekungers,</hi> who aimed at the
Crown. To bring theſe over to his Party the King had
married three of his Siſters to three of the Chiefeſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, he himſelf having married <hi>Catharine</hi> the

King's Siſters Son:<note place="margin">1251.</note> Who being Crowned in the year next
following, the Adminiſtration of the Kingdom was
committed during his minority to his Father <hi>Birger,</hi> who
augmented the antient Law Book, and deſerved ſo well

was created a Duke, whereas before he had been only
an Earl, or as it is in their antient Language <hi>Yerl.</hi> He
met with great oppoſition from the <hi>Tolekungers,</hi> who

But the Duke, under pretence of making an agreement
with them, after having granted them a ſafe Conduct
perſuaded them to give him a meeting, where having
made them all Priſoners cauſed them to be Executed,

raiſed great Diſturbances: for <hi>Waldemar</hi> having,
during his Pilgrimage to <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> left the

theſe differences if poſſible;<note place="margin">1275.</note> but met with ſo much
difficulty that it was impoſſible to be effected. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Magnus</hi> and <hi>Erick</hi> being retired into <hi>Denmark,</hi> ſoon
returned from thence with a conſiderable Force; and
having routed the Vanguard of King <hi>Waldemar,</hi> made
him their Priſoner. Whereupon <hi>Magnus</hi> called together
the Eſtates of the Kingdom; who being moſt of them
of his Party, did aſſign the whole Kingdom to Duke
<hi>Magnus,</hi> except only Eaſt and Weſt <hi>Gothland, Smaland</hi>

Having thus ſettled his Affairs, he got his Lady <hi>Hederig</hi>

was but three years old his Succeſſor in the Kingdom,<note place="margin">1303.</note>
which was confirmed by the chief Men of the Kingdom,
and eſpecially by his Brothers. But this ſolemn Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action
was of no long continuance, for the Brothers
quickly fell into diviſions among themſelves, and the
two younger growing miſtruſtful of the King, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal
retired firſt into <hi>Denmark,</hi> and from thence into
<hi>Norway,</hi> to make uſe of that King's Interceſſion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
their Inheritance, which King <hi>Birger</hi> had ſeiſed
upon; but all this proving ineffectual, they made ſeveral
Inroads into <hi>Weſt-Gothland,</hi> and killed and diſperſed the
<hi>Swediſh</hi> Troops that were ſent to oppoſe them. The

King went at laſt in perſon with an Army, and was met
by his Brothers with ſome Forces, which they had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained

the Ammoſities betwixt the Brothers, and ſome other
matters laid to his charge, was beheaded at <hi>Stockhelm.</hi>
But no ſooner was this Wiſe Man dead, but the two
younger Brothers began to aim again at the Crown, and
having ſurpriſed the K. and Q. at their Country Seat
called <hi>Hatuna</hi> forced him to reſign the Kingdom, and to
ſurrender the Crown and City of <hi>Stockholm</hi> to his Brother
<hi>Erick,</hi> who made the King a Priſoner in the Caſtle of

carried into <hi>Denmark.</hi> The King of <hi>Denmark</hi> undertook
3 ſeveral Expeditions to relieve his Brother-in-law and
Siſter, but to no great purpoſe, only that at laſt it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed,
that the King, Queen and their Children ſhould

which occaſioning ſome new Taxes, proved alſo
the occaſion of ſome Inſurrections in the Kingdom,
which were nevertheleſs happily appeaſed, and Peace
reſtored to the whole Kingdom.</p>
               <p>In the mean while Duke <hi>Waldemar</hi> in his journey
from <hi>Calmar</hi> to <hi>Stockholm,</hi> gave a viſit to the King at

                  <hi>Waldemar,</hi> being overcome by theſe
fair Promiſes, over-perſuaded his Brother <hi>Erick,</hi> who
was very averſe to it at firſt, but at laſt conſented. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
arrived in the Caſtle where the King was, they were
kindly received and ſplendidly entertained at Supper;
but they had not been long in bed, and moſt of their
Servants diſperſed into ſeveral Quarters of the Town,
till they were made Priſoners, beaten, abuſed, and half
naked, loaden with Irons, thrown into a ſtrong Tower,
their Servants having been all either killed or taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners.
The King marched directly for <hi>Stockholm,</hi> in
hopes to ſurpriſe the City; but the News of this barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
act having been already carried to <hi>Stockholm,</hi> they
not only repulſed him, but alſo purſued him to <hi>Nycoping.</hi>
The King perceiving that they intended to beſiege <hi>Nyco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,</hi>

which had quite ruined the Trade of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
This pernicious War having thus laſted ſeven
Years, a Treaty of Peace was ſet on foot at <hi>Helſingburgh,</hi>
which proving fruitleſs,<note place="margin">1394.</note> another meeting was appointed

Years after, when he at the appointed time reſigned his

Kingdom grown very jealous of the greatneſs of the
Marſhal, the Treaty was renewed with the King at
<hi>Calmar,</hi> who came thither in Perſon, and promiſed to
put into all Offices and Places of Truſt, Natives of
<hi>Sweden,</hi> and having made <hi>Benedict Suenſon</hi> Governour of
the Caſtle of <hi>Calmar,</hi> appointed an Aſſembly of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate

when he would be ready to ſurrender all the Strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds
into the hands of the Native Subjects of <hi>Sweden,</hi>
But in the mean time the King in his Voyage from
<hi>Gothland</hi> to <hi>Suderkoping,</hi> was overtaken by a violent
Tempeſt, wherein moſt of his Ships having been loſt,
he narrowly eſcaped drowing. As ſoon as the <hi>Swedes</hi>
got notice of this Misfortune, not knowing whether the
King was alive or dead, it was reſolved that the laſt
Treaty made at <hi>Calmar</hi> ſhould remain in Force. Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuant
to this Decree, the Marſhal having partly by great
Promiſes, partly by Threats, got into the poſſeſſion of
all the Caſtles of the Kingdom, ſeemed to want nothing
to accompliſh his Deſigns, but the Title of a King, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <hi>Erick Pueke</hi> being vexed to the Soul, raiſed a great
number of Boors againſt him, who having defeated the
Marſhal and his Forces, would quickly have put an
end to his Greatneſs, if he under pretence of reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
had not invited <hi>Erick Pueke</hi> to an interview, and
notwithſtanding his Faith given, ſent him to <hi>Stockholm,</hi>
where he was beheaded. In the mean while, the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of the Kingdom having got notice that the King was
alive,<note place="margin">1437.</note> appointed an Aſſembly to be held at <hi>Calmar,</hi>
where the King was to fulfil the former Treaty; but
the King not coming at the appointed time, Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
were ſent into <hi>Denmark</hi> to treat with him about
the performance of the Agreement made at <hi>Calmar,</hi>
which he refuſing to do, they made an underhand
League with ſome of the great Men in <hi>Denmark</hi> againſt
King <hi>Erick.</hi> the effects of which he felt ſoon after.
Whileſt theſe things were tranſacting in <hi>Denmark,</hi> the
Marſhal had by his cunning got the whole Power of the
Kingdom into his hands, and obtained from the Senate
in <hi>Sweden,</hi> to appoint a certain day for the King to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in <hi>Sweden,</hi> and put an end to thoſe Differences that
were then betwixt him and the Eſtates, and in caſe of a
refuſal, they renounced their Allegiance to him. But
the Archbiſhop <hi>Oluf,</hi> and ſome of the Chief Men of the
Kingdom, that were diſſatisfied at the Marſhal's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
did ſo far prevail by their Authority, that a
General Aſſembly of all the Senators of the three Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
Kingdoms ſhould be held at <hi>Calmar,</hi> which in
all likelihood might have had better Succeſs than before,
if the Archbiſhop had not been poyſoned in his Journey
thither by the Marſhal. Notwithſtanding this, the reſt
of the Senators appeared at <hi>Calmar,</hi> but the King's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
refuſing to acknowledge and to confirm the
Treaty made at <hi>Calmar,</hi> which the <hi>Swedes</hi> inſiſted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the whole meeting proved fruitleſs. In the mean

out of <hi>Denmark</hi> into <hi>Gothland,</hi> and the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Senators
who as well as the <hi>Swedes</hi> had been diſſatisfied with the
King for a conſiderable time before, agreed with the
<hi>Swedes</hi> to renounce their Allegiance to him, and to
chooſe one in his ſtead, that would maintain the Union
betwixt theſe Kingdoms. The <hi>Danes</hi> therefore ſent

and to treat with them to receive him alſo for their

Party were not a little ſurpriſed at this Propoſition; but
perceiving that, at the Dyet held at <hi>Arboga,</hi> moſt of the
Eſtates were inclined to maintain the Union, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<hi>Chriſtopher</hi> for their King, they alſo agreed with

But the <hi>Danes</hi> offered the Crown of <hi>Denmark</hi> to

<hi>Charles,</hi> at the very beginning of his Reign, beſieged
King <hi>Erick</hi> in the Caſtle of <hi>Wisby,</hi> who having deluded

cauſed him to be carried Priſoner to <hi>Copenhagen.</hi> This
ſo exaſperated <hi>Katil</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Lyncoping</hi> that he
raiſed an Inſurrection againſt the King, and forced

King <hi>Chriſtian</hi> to his Aſſiſtance, who having taken
ſome Ships loaden with Amunition belonging to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
and in vain endeavoured to relieve the beſieged
Caſtle, the War was begun on both ſides. For the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop
having been forced to ſurrender the Caſtle and
his Office, Pope <hi>Leo</hi> thereupon excommunicated the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
laying a Fine of 100000 Ducats upon the <hi>Swedes,</hi>
and enjoyning the execution thereof to King <hi>Chriſtian.</hi>
Purſuant to this Decree, the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> fell with
a great Army into <hi>Sweden,</hi> and was met by the Regent
and his Forces in <hi>Weſt-Gothland,</hi> but the Regent having
received a Wound there, of which he died ſoon after at
<hi>Strengneſs,</hi> his Army firſt retreated, and being deprived
of a Leader, afterwards diſperſed. King <hi>Chriſtian</hi> then
having divided his Army, ſent one part into <hi>Weſt</hi> and
<hi>Eaſt-Gothland,</hi> which were ſoon ſubdued, and marched

of the Archbiſhop and the ruining of his Caſtle
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:65650:270"/>
of <hi>Stecka.</hi> For tho' the King by an Amneſtie had par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
all paſt Offences, yet no ſatisfaction having been

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pſal,</hi> and his Caſtle of
<hi>Stecka.</hi> And to make up the matter, it was pretended
that Gunpowder had been conveyed into the King's Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
to blow him up. <hi>Steen Sture</hi>'s Widow, his Mother
in Law, fifteen others beſides the Senare and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty
of <hi>Stockholm,</hi> were accuſed as Actors and Abettors,
who were all condemned as Hereticks, ninety four of
them, all People of Note, being beheaded at <hi>Stockholm</hi>
and their Servants hanged up with Boots and Spurs.
The deceaſed Regent's body having been digged up, was
expoſed among the reſt of the executed Perſons, and
the Quarters ſet up and down the Country. His Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
and Mother in Law were forced to purchaſe their

declared him Regent of that Kingdom, except the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop
and his Party, that remained firm to the <hi>Daniſh</hi>

Coin wherever they met them, and with the Aſſiſtance
of the <hi>Lubeckers</hi> beſieged <hi>Stockholm,</hi> which was as yet in

recovered the Caſtle and City of <hi>Calmar,</hi> and made <hi>Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtave</hi>
King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> who thereupon immediately ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned
<hi>Stockholm</hi> to a ſurrender, and the Garriſon being
without hopes of relief, ſurrendred the City and Caſtle
to the <hi>Lubeckers,</hi> who reſtored the ſame to King <hi>Guſtave.</hi>
In the mean while King <hi>Chriſtian</hi> was retired with his
Queen into the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and the <hi>Jutlanders</hi> having
made <hi>Frederick</hi> I. King <hi>Chriſtian</hi>'s Uncle, their King,
would fain have perſwaded the <hi>Swedes</hi> to follow their
example, but theſe being not ambitious of continuing
the Union with <hi>Denmark,</hi> had refuſed their proffer, and
choſen <hi>Guſtave</hi> their King. But King <hi>Guſtave</hi> finding
the Treaſury mightily exhauſted by theſe long inteſtine
Wars, he not only taxed the Clergy to pay conſiderable
Sums towards the payment of his Souldiers, but alſo
made bold with the ſuperfluous Ornaments of the
Churches, againſt which, <hi>Brask</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoping</hi>
having proteſted and made complaint thereof to <hi>Johannes
Magnus</hi> the Pope's Legate, <hi>Peter</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Weſteraas</hi>
endeavoured to raiſe an Inſurrection among the <hi>Dale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But whileſt theſe Biſhops were employed in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
their Privileges, the Proteſtant Religion had
begun to ſpread all over the Kingdom. The ſame was
by ſome Merchants and <hi>German</hi> Souldiers firſt introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
into <hi>Sweden,</hi> and ſome <hi>Swediſh</hi> Students, that had
ſtudied at <hi>Wittenbergh,</hi> had brought along with them
into their Native Country, both the Doctrine and
Writings of <hi>Luther.</hi> Among theſe one <hi>Olaus Petri</hi> was
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:65650:271"/>
the chiefeſt, who having been an Auditor of <hi>Luther,</hi> at his

to the Biſhops of <hi>Strengueſs:</hi> this Man after the death of
the Biſhop, having brought <hi>Lars Anderſon</hi> the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon
over to his Opinion, began not only to defend
<hi>Luther</hi>'s Doctrine publickly in the Schools, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
to publiſh the ſame from the Pulpit. The Biſhop
being abſent, Dr. <hi>Nils</hi> Dean of that Chapter, with all
his might oppoſed this new Doctrine, which being come
to the King's Ears, he adviſed with <hi>Lars Anderſon,</hi> who
having inſtructed him in the chief Points of it,<note place="margin">Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on begun in <hi>Sweden.</hi>
                  </note> and in
what manner a great many <hi>German</hi> Princes had taken
away the ſuperfluous riches of the Clergy, began to
hearken to his Opinion, reſolving nevertheleſs to go on
cautiouſly in this buſineſs, and to ſee how ſome Princes
in <hi>Germany</hi> ſhould proceed in this Affair, as alſo how
the Biſhops in <hi>Sweden</hi> would reliſh this Doctrine. In
the mean while Pope <hi>Hadrian</hi> IV. had ſent his Legate
into <hi>Sweden</hi> to endeavour the extirpation of this He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie,
and the Clergy of <hi>Sweden</hi> grew every day more
refractory, refuſing to pay the Taxes impoſed upon
them, as being contrary to their Privileges. On the
other hand, <hi>Olaus Petri</hi> being encouraged by the King,
was not ſilent, but defended his Cauſe both by Diſpute
and Writing, with ſuch Succeſs, that the King not only
conſtituted him Miniſter in the great Church of <hi>Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holm,</hi>
and put into other vacant Church-Benefices, ſuch
Miniſters as had ſtudied at <hi>Wittenbergh,</hi> but alſo conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
over the Dominicans and Black Fryars, ſuch Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors
as he knew to be faithful to him, and ſuch of them
as were Foreigners he baniſhed the Kingdom, and told

                  </hi> that he could not deny Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
to the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> as long as they were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
of any Crime or Errour.</p>
               <p>But all this while one <hi>Soren Norby,</hi> who ſtill adhered
to King <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> had <hi>Gothland</hi> in his Poſſeſſion, and
did conſiderable damage to the <hi>Swedes</hi> in their Trade;

Melan</hi> with ſome Forces to reduce the ſaid <hi>Iſland,</hi> and
<hi>Norby</hi> finding himſelf too weak put himſelf and the

                  <pb n="492" facs="tcp:65650:272"/>
who had been very good Friends ever before. About
this time <hi>Olaus Petri</hi> was publickly married in the great
Church at <hi>Stockholm,</hi> and the King had not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the Tenths of the Clergy towards the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of his Forces, but alſo Quartered ſome of his
Horſe in the Monaſteries, which ſo incenſed Biſhop
<hi>Brask,</hi> that he forbid in his whole Dioceſs ſo much as
to name the Doctrine of <hi>Luther.</hi> But the King having

                  </gap>eliſhed
very ill with the Biſhops, yet were they fain to comply
with the King's command, who, to mortifie them the
more, alſo ordered a Diſputation to be held at <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pſal</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Dr. <hi>Pieter Galle</hi> and <hi>Olaus Petri,</hi> concerning the
chiefeſt Points in queſtion betwixt the <hi>Roman</hi> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
and <hi>Lutherans,</hi> where <hi>Olaus Petri</hi> had much the
better, and his Tranſlation was approved of before the
others, which had been patched up by ſo many Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlators.
In the mean time the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Clergy had given
a conſiderable Subſidy to their King to be employed
againſt King <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> wherefore King <hi>Guſtave,</hi> taking
hold of this opportunity, demanded a conſiderable ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
from the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Clergy, but theſe objecting that it
was againſt their Privileges and Rights, the King or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
the ſame to be examined in another Diſpute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<hi>Olaus Petri,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Pieter Galle,</hi> and becauſe
they were not able to prove their Title out of the Holy
Scripture, the King concluded them to be dependent on
his pleaſure, and at the Dyet held at <hi>Weſteraos</hi> not only
demanded a ſupply from the Clergy, but alſo propoſed
that the ſuperfluous Bells ſhould be taken out of the
Churches, and be employed towards the payment of
the Debt due to the <hi>Lubeckers.</hi> And becauſe the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop
grew more troubleſome every day, the King firſt
took him into Cuſtody, and afterwards ſent him Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour
into <hi>Poland,</hi> from whence he never returned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Sweden.</hi> He alſo commanded another Diſputation to
be held concerning the chief Points in queſtion betwixt
the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, which however
met with great oppoſition from Biſhop <hi>Brask,</hi> and the
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:65650:272"/>
reſt of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Clergy, who ſet up a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
Fellow, againſt <hi>Guſtave.</hi> This Fellow pretended to
be the Son of <hi>Steen Sture</hi> (notwithſtanding he was dead
a twelve month before) and having got a party among
the <hi>Dalekerls,</hi> and being upheld by Biſhop <hi>Brask</hi> and
the Biſhop of <hi>Druntheim</hi> in <hi>Norway,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1527.</note> and encouraged in
his undertaking by King <hi>Frederick</hi> of <hi>Denmark,</hi> laid
open claim to the Crown, threatning all the <hi>Lutherans</hi>
and eſpecially the City of <hi>Stockholm</hi> with Fire and
Sword, which was the moſt forward in ſettling the
Proteſtant Religion.</p>
               <p>About the ſame time the Emperour had beſieged
Pope <hi>Clement</hi> VII. in the Caſtle of St. <hi>Angelo,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
King <hi>Guſtave</hi> taking hold of this Juncture, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
a Dyet to be held at <hi>Weſteraos,</hi> where in his
Declaration he profeſſed; <hi>that the</hi> Roman <hi>Catholick
Clergy had made it their buſineſs to charge him with
making Innovation in Religion for no other reaſon, but
that he would not let them domineer over the Laymen,
and had forced them to ſubmit to the Civil Power, and
to give part of their ſuperfluous Riches, ſome of which
they had got by fraud, towards eaſing the Common People
of thoſe burthenſome Taxes (which he hitherto had been
forced to impoſe upon them.) And that for the ſame Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
the Emperour himſelf had been forced lately to teach
the Pope his duty.</hi> The ſame thing was propoſed by the
King to the whole Dyet, where he told them; that the
ſuperfluous Revenues of the Clergy ought to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
to the Crown, and eſpecially ſuch Lands as ſince
the year 1454 had been given to the Clergy, ſhould
be reſtored to the right Heirs, promiſing withal that
the Common People ſhould be for the future eaſed of
their Taxes; in caſe they would give their conſent to
the reduction of the Revenues of the Clergy. And the
better to get the conſent of the Temporal Lords and
Senators he made a great Banquet, where he gave the
next place to himſelf to theſe Senators, whereas the ſame
had belonged formerly to the Biſhops, who now were
forced to be contented with the next place after them,
the third place was given to the reſt of the Nobility,
the fourth to the inferiour Clergy, the fifth to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens,
the ſixth to the Boors; which ſo exaſperated the
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:65650:273"/>
Clergy that they aſſembled in the Church of St. <hi>Egidius,</hi>
and ſecretly took a reſolution among themſelves not to
obey the King in this Point, not to ſurrender any of
their Revenues, or to recede from their antient Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And Biſhop <hi>Brask</hi> freely told the King, <hi>that the
Clergy of the Kingdom had ſuch a ſtrict dependency on
the Pope, that without his conſent they could not do any
thing whatſoever.</hi> Which as it met with great appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
from all the reſt of the Clergy, and from ſome
of the Temporal Eſtates, ſo the King was ſo incenſed
thereat, that he immediately roſe from his Seat, and
told the Eſtates that he was ready to Abdicate the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
if they would repay him his Charges and Monies
which he had laid out for that uſe, and to ſhow them
that he was in earneſt, retired for ſeveral days with ſome
of his chief Officers into the Caſtle. The Eſtates be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
much ſurpriſed at the King's reſolution, eſpecially
when they ſaw the Citizens of <hi>Stockholm</hi> to be ſtedfaſt
to the King, and that Dr. <hi>Peter Galle</hi> was worſted by
<hi>Olaus Petri</hi> in a late Diſputation, thought it their beſt
way to beg the King's pardon and to intreat him not to
reſign the Crown. Upon their reiterated requeſt the
King having been at laſt prevailed upon to come out of
the Caſtle, demanded from ſeveral Biſhops to ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
into his hands their Caſtles, and to ſubſcribe a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
made at this Dyet, concerning the regulating of
the Clergy, which they were fain to comply withal. As
ſoon as the Dyet was ended he took not only from the
Monaſteries ſuch Lands as had been given to them
ſince the year 1454.<note place="margin">Church Lands re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in <hi>Sweden.</hi>
                  </note> but alſo ſeveral other Church Lands
and precious moveables, all which he annexed to the
Crown. In the mean while the Biſhops and their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
were not idle, but were contriving all manner of
miſchief againſt the King, though with ſmall ſucceſs.
For the <hi>Dalekerls,</hi> who had made an Inſurrection, were
frightened by the King to comply with his commands,
and to ſend away their Leader, the ſuppoſititious <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> King of <hi>Poland,</hi> unto whom the diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
party had proffered the Crown, did not think fit
to accept of it; ſo that Biſhop <hi>Brask,</hi> deſpairing at laſt
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Cauſe, under pretence of a
Journey retired to <hi>Dantzick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="495" facs="tcp:65650:273"/>
The King having ſurmounted all theſe difficulties,
thought convenient not to defer any longer his Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">1528.</note>
which having been ſolemnized at <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pſal</hi> with the

to appear before him at <hi>Thuana,</hi> threatning them
with Fire and Sword if they did not appear at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
time; The Rebels being throughly frightened
by the King's ſeverity appeared without Arms at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
place, where he cauſed ſeveral of the Ringlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
to be Executed, and diſmiſſed the reſt, after having
promiſed to be obedient for the future. In <hi>Helſingland</hi>
he appeaſed the tumultuous multitude with threats,
and fined their Leaders, and having called together a
Synod of the Clergy at <hi>Orebro,</hi> where the King's Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour
was Preſident, the chiefeſt Points of the Popiſh
Doctrine were there aboliſhed, and in their ſtead the
Proteſtant Religion introduced, where it was alſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
that a Proteſtant Profeſſor of Divinity ſhould be
Conſtituted in each Cathedral. This wrought in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

who left their Monaſteries, were married, and became
Miniſters in the Proteſtant Churches. But the Biſhops
and their party entred into an Aſſociation with ſome of
the diſſatisfied Lords in <hi>Weſt Gothland,</hi> who accuſed the
King of Hereſie and other Crimes, renouncing their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance
to him. Theſe were Headed by <hi>Thuro Johan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>

and Eaſt <hi>Gothes,</hi> whom he perſuaded to make <hi>Magnus

King. But the King having again appeaſed this tumult
by granting his Pardon to them, <hi>Magnus</hi> the Biſhop of

the two firſt were Executed, and the third paid a

For ſome of them having put themſelves under the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection

As he was very inconſtant in his Temper, and very Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious,
being much addicted to Aſtrology, ſo after
this misfortune he laid aſide the thoughts of this Marriage
for a while, making his Addreſſes by his Ambaſſadours,

the Princeſs of <hi>Lorain</hi> both at one time, and not long

his Borther <hi>John</hi> had married <hi>Katharine</hi> Daughter of
<hi>Sigiſmund</hi> King of <hi>Poland,</hi> which having been done
without Ring <hi>Erick's</hi> good liking, who was both mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſtful
of the <hi>Poles</hi> and his Brother, put him into ſuch
a rage, that he beſieged his Brother in the Caſtle of

him to be ſentenced to death, which Sentence he how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
changed into a perpetual Impriſonment for that time,

the <hi>Swedes</hi> routed the <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Lubeckers</hi> in ſeveral

murthered there by the King's command, but he alſo
with his own hands ſtab'd <hi>Nils Sture,</hi> and repenting ſoon
after of ſo barbarous a Fact cauſed his former Tutor
<hi>Dionyſius,</hi> who adviſed it, to be ſlain by his Guards.</p>
               <p>A great part of the Kingdom, having been put into

lay the blame of theſe barbarities upon <hi>Joran Peerſon</hi>
his Favourite, who having been committed to Priſon the

But the King having not long after been very ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesful
in ſeveral Engagements againſt the <hi>Danes,</hi> whom he
beat quite out of <hi>Denmark</hi> he ſoon after releaſed his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite,

Biſhops and Clergy at <hi>Stockholm</hi> propoſed to them a new
form of a Liturgy, wherein a great many of the Popiſh
Ceremonies were to be uſed in the Adminiſtration of the
Sacraments, and Conſecration of Biſhops and Prieſts,
as alſo the Maſs was again introduced; which new
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:65650:278"/>
Liturgy he got ſubſcribed by the new Conſecrated Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
and ſome of the inferiour Clergy, and was called
the Liturgy of the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Church, conform to the
Catholick and Orthodox Church. This Liturgy having
been publiſhed under the new Archbiſhop's name in the
<hi>Swediſh</hi> and Latin Tongues, the Maſs and other <hi>Roman</hi>
Catholick Hymns were again ſung in the <hi>Swediſh</hi>
Churches (except in the Territories belonging to Duke
<hi>Charles</hi> the King's Brother) and the Celibacy of Prieſts
and other Popiſh Doctrines mightily extolled in the
Pulpits by theſe diſguiſed <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks. The next
thing to be done was to try whether he could bring over
his Brother <hi>Charles</hi> to his party whom he ſollicited by
his Delegates to introduce the Liturgy into his Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories,
who having made anſwer that it was, (according
to their Father's Teſtament) neither in his, nor in the
King's power to make any Innovation in Religion, this
proved the ſubject of a great miſunderſtanding betwixt
them. Next the King had his recourſe to the Pope,
who alſo having diſapproved his undertaking, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
from the Clergy at <hi>Stockholm</hi> to give their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
of the ſaid Liturgy, but theſe anſwered that
thereby a door was opened for the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick
Religion to be re-eſtabliſhed in <hi>Sweden,</hi> and having made
their Appeal to a General Synod of that Clergy in the
Kingdom, a Convocation of the Clergy of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
(except thoſe in the Duke's Territories) was held
by the King's Authority,<note place="margin">1577.</note> where the King's party pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed,<note place="margin">New Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.</note>
ſo, that the Liturgy was confirmed not only by
the ſaid Clergy, but alſo by the Temporal Eſtates, who
declared all ſuch Traitors as ſhould for the future op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the ſame. The King having gained this point
baniſhed and impriſoned ſome of thoſe, that would not
conform to the ſaid Liturgy, notwithſtanding which a
great many of the Clergy that were profeſſed Enemies
of the ſaid Liturgy, and upheld by Duke <hi>Charles</hi> did
not only boldly diſcover the deceitful ſnares of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
party, but alſo ſent to the <hi>German</hi> Univerſities of
<hi>Wittembergh, Leipzick, Helmſtad, Francfut</hi> and others,
where their Zeal for the <hi>Augsburg</hi> Confeſſion was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved,
and the ſaid Liturgy condemned as dangerous
to the Proteſtant Religion. Hitherto King <hi>Erick</hi> had
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:65650:278"/>
ſuffered a very hard impriſonment during the ſpace of
nine years, but he having in the mean while by ſeveral
ways endeavoured his delivery, and King <hi>John</hi> now fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that perhaps theſe Inteſtine Diviſions might furniſh
him with an opportunity to make his eſcape, he ſent his
Secretary to give him his laſt Doſe, which he did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,
having poiſoned him in a Peaſe Soop. The
King being rid of this danger began now to act more
barefaced than before; for now the Invocation of Saints
was publickly taught in the Pulpits, thoſe that contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
it were impriſoned, a new Univerſity of Papiſts
was to be erected at <hi>Stockholm,</hi> he ſent his Ambaſſadour
to reſide at <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Pope had his Nuncio at
<hi>Stockholm,</hi> and to compleat the matter, a great many
young Scholars were ſent to the Jeſuits abroad, to be
duely inſtructed in their Principles. In the mean while
the War betwixt the <hi>Swedes</hi> and <hi>Moſcovites</hi> was carried
on without any remarkable advantage on either ſide, till
it was agreed betwixt the two Kings of <hi>Poland</hi> and
<hi>Sweden,</hi> that each of them ſhould act ſeparately againſt
the <hi>Moſcovites,</hi> and what either of them could gain by
his Sword, ſhould remain in his poſſeſſion. Then it
was that <hi>Stephen</hi> King of <hi>Poland</hi> having attacked the
<hi>Moſcovites</hi> vigorouſly on his ſide, the <hi>Swedes</hi> alſo under
the Command of <hi>Pontus de la Gordie</hi> took from the
<hi>Moſcovites</hi> the ſtrong Forthreſs of <hi>Kekholm,</hi> the Caſtle of
<hi>Padis, Weſenburgh, Telsburgh, Narva,</hi> (where 7000
<hi>Moſcovites</hi> were killed) <hi>Jawmagrod</hi> and other places of
note, which raiſed ſuch a jealouſie in the <hi>Poles</hi> that
they not only made a ſeparate Peach with the <hi>Moſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1582.</note>
but alſo demanded ſeveral of thoſe places, taken
from the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> by the <hi>Swedes,</hi> for their ſhare,
which put a great ſtop to the <hi>Swediſh</hi> progreſſes, and
occaſioned a Truce of two years (which was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
prolonged for four years longer) betwixt them
and the <hi>Moſcovites.</hi> Whilſt theſe things were tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting
the miſunderſtanding betwixt the King and his
Brother <hi>Charles</hi> could not be removed, notwithſtanding
that the Duke had ſhown his inclination of having theſe
Differences compoſed, but the King having called toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a Dyet at <hi>Wadſtena,</hi> ſent a ſummons to the Duke
to appear there in perſon. The Duke on the other hand,
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:65650:279"/>
who did not altogether truſt the King, having aſſembled
ſome Forces in his Territories, did not appear at the
ſaid Dyet, but lodged himſelf in ſome of the adjacent
Villages, were at laſt by the mediation of ſome of the
Senators, the Brothers were reconciled, the Duke having
begged the King's pardon,<note place="margin">1587.</note> and referred the Differences
concerning the Liturgy to the deciſion of his Clergy,
who at an Aſſembly held <hi>at Strengneſs</hi> rejected the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
Liturgy. In the mean while died <hi>Stephen</hi> King of
<hi>Poland,</hi> and his Widow <hi>Ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>

the Son of King <hi>John,</hi> ſhe prevailed with ſome
of the great Men in <hi>Poland</hi> to make him their King,
which was done accordingly, tho' not without great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
on the <hi>Swediſh</hi> ſide, who could not for a great
while agree to the ſeveral Propoſitions made to them by
the <hi>Poles,</hi> and King <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> himſelf ſeemed ſoon after
to repent of it. As ſoon as <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> had left <hi>Sweden,</hi>
his Father King <hi>John</hi> began to renew his Care for eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing
the new Liturgy in the Duke's Territories;
but the Clergy there truſting upon the Duke's Authority
and Protection, remaining ſtedfaſt in their Opinion; the
King at laſt being tired out by their conſtancy, ſent for
his Brother <hi>Charles</hi> to <hi>Stockholm,</hi> where a hearty recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation
being made betwixt them, <hi>Charles</hi> was ſo dear
to him ever after, that he did nothing without his Advice
or Conſent, which Friendſhip continued betwixt the
two Brothers till a little before the King's death, when
<hi>Charles</hi> having married <hi>Cloriſtina</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Adolph</hi>
Duke of <hi>Holſtein,</hi> the former jealouſy was renewed in
ſome meaſure in the King, which ſoon ceaſed by his
death,<note place="margin">1592.</note> which happened a few Months after at <hi>Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 12. After King <hi>John</hi>'s death had been kept ſecret
for two days, the ſame having been notified to Duke
<hi>Charles,</hi> he forthwith came to <hi>Stockholm,</hi> and having ſent
a Meſſenger to King <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> in <hi>Poland,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sigiſmund.</note> he in the mean
while took upon him the Adminiſtration of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with the Conſent of the Senate, which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
to him by King <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> for that time. Soon
after, he called together the <hi>Swediſh</hi> and <hi>Gothick</hi> Clergy
at <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pſat</hi> (the <hi>Finns</hi> refuſing to appear) where the <hi>Augſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi>
                  <pb n="507" facs="tcp:65650:279"/>
Confeſſion was confirmed, and the Liturgy, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
Popiſh Ceremonies newly introduced quite aboliſhed.
This Decree having been approved of by the reſt of the
Eſtates, they alſo made another, wherein was declared,
That no body ſhould appeal out of <hi>Sweden</hi> to the King
in <hi>Poland,</hi> and that the King ſhould ſubſcribe theſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
before his Coronation. This proved the ſubject
of great broils afterwards, for the King having under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
what had paſſed at <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pſal,</hi> he declared, that he
being a hereditary Prince in <hi>Sweden,</hi> would not oblige
himſelf to any thing before his Coronation, and as to
the Decrees made at <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pſal,</hi> he declared them void,
which the Eſtates looked upon as an ill Omen for the
Proteſtant Religion in <hi>Sweden.</hi> Their jealouſie was alſo
not a little augmented when they ſaw King <hi>Sigiſmund</hi>
come into <hi>Sweden</hi> accompanied by the Pope's Nuncio,
by whoſe advice the King demanded a Church for the
Roman Catholicks in each City, that the new Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop
ſhould be depoſed, and that he would be Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Pope's Nuncio which obliged the Eſtates to
ſend their Deputies to Duke <hi>Charles,</hi> to deſire him to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe
his Authority with the King. <hi>Charles</hi> therefore
having in conjunction with the Eſtates, in vain endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to perſwade the King to a compliance with the
Eſtates, entred into an Aſſociation with them for the
defence of the Proteſtant Religion, and muſtered his
Troops near <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pſal.</hi> The King perceiving them to be
in earneſt, thought it his beſt way not to let things run
to extremity, but having conſented to moſt of their
Propoſitions, which he ſurrendred to them the ſame
morning when he was to be crowned, the Coronation
was performed by the Biſhop of <hi>Strengneſs.</hi> But no ſooner
was he returned to <hi>Stockholm,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1594.</note> but he took a reſolution
quite contrary to his Promiſe, with an intention to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
by force what he could not get by fair means.
Wherefore having ſent for ſome Forces out of <hi>Poland,</hi> he
hoped to terrifie the Eſtates into a compliance at the
next Dyet, but theſe being backed by Duke <hi>Charles,</hi> and
having raiſed the <hi>Delekerls,</hi> remained ſtedfaſt in their
Reſolution. The King ſeeing himſelf diſappointed again
in his Deſign, reſolved upon the advice of the <hi>Poles,</hi> to
leave the Kingdom and the Government in an unſettled
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:65650:280"/>
Condition, hoping thereby to oblige them to be more
pliable for the future. But as ſoon as the Senators un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
that he was ſailed towards <hi>Dantzick,</hi> they in
conjunction with Duke <hi>Charles,</hi> took upon themſelves
the adminiſtration of the Government, depoſed the King's
Governour of <hi>Stockholm</hi> (he being a Papi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t) and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
the exerciſe of the Romiſh Religion. And ſoon
after, a Peace having been concluded with the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi>
a Dyet was held at <hi>Sudercoping,</hi> where after the Eſtates
had juſtified their proceeding in a Letter to the King, the
<hi>Augsburgh</hi> Confeſſion was again confirmed, the Popiſh
Religion aboliſhed, and all <hi>Swedes</hi> that adhered to the
ſame, declared incapable of any Employments in the
Kingdom, and ſeveral other Decrees were made againſt
the Papiſts, and for the maintaining of the Privileges of
the Subjects. Then they conſtituted Duke <hi>Charles</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
of the Kingdom to govern the ſame with Advice of
the Senate, and the whole Tranſaction was publiſhed
in the <hi>Latin, Swediſh</hi> and <hi>German</hi> Tongues. This ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
occaſioned a general flight among the Roman
Catholicks out of <hi>Sweden;</hi> King <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> was ſo
diſſatisfied thereat, that he quickly ſent ſome Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners
out of <hi>Poland</hi> to diſſwade the Duke from theſe
proceedings, but alſo when this proved ineffectual by his
Letter to the Eſtates he committed the whole management
of Affairs to the Senate, excluding the Duke from the
Regency. In the mean while ſome Senators either to
curry favour with the King, or upon ſome diſtaſte taken
againſt Duke <hi>Charles,</hi> had ſhewn themſelves great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourers
of the King, and declined to appear at the Dyet,
which was appointed to be held under the Duke's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
at <hi>Arboga.</hi> Notwithſtanding which, the few Senators
and the Eſtates there preſent did again confirm the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
lately made at <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pſal</hi> and <hi>Sudercoping,</hi> declaring
Duke <hi>Carles</hi> ſole Regent of <hi>Sweden.</hi> But <hi>Niclaco Flem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming</hi>
the King's General, being in Arms, and having
lately killed a great number of the Boors, the Duke alſo
thought it not fit to fit ſtill, but having gathered what
Troops he could, poſſeſſed himſelf firſt of <hi>Gothland,</hi> and
not long after of the whole Kingdom of <hi>Sweden,</hi> the
King's Governours and thoſe of the Senators, that
had not appeared at the laſt Dyet held at <hi>Arboga,</hi> flying
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:65650:280"/>
in great numbers to the King in <hi>Poland.</hi> King <hi>Sigiſmund</hi>
then perceiving that his preſence was abſolutely neceſſary
in <hi>Sweden,</hi> reſolved to go thither in Perſon with 6000 Men,
which the Duke having been advertiſed of,<note place="margin">1598.</note> called to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
the Eſtates of the <hi>Gothick</hi> Kingdom at <hi>Wadſtena,</hi>
and having made known to them the King's intention,
it was unanimouſly reſolved to meet the King with an
Army near <hi>Calmar.</hi> But the <hi>Weſt-Goths</hi> and <hi>Smalanders</hi>
having taken up Arms for the King, and the <hi>Finns</hi>
equipped ſome Ships for this Service, the former were
beat back by the Boors, headed by two Profeſſors of
<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pſal,</hi> and whileſt Duke <hi>Charles</hi> was ſailed with his.
Fleet to reduce the latter, which he did with good Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
the King without any oppoſition arrived at <hi>Calmar.</hi>
Several Treaties were then ſet on foot to endeavour the
ſettlement of the Kingdom, and to reconcile Matters
betwixt the King and Duke, which proving ineffectual,
both Parties had recourſe to Arms. The firſt encounter
happened near <hi>Stegeburgh,</hi> where the Duke's Forces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſurrounded, were quickly put to the rout, but lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down their Arms, obtained Pardon from the King;
but the Duke ſoon made amends for this Misfortune, at
<hi>Stangbroo,</hi> where having ſurpriſed part of the King's
Army, he killed 2000 of them upon the ſpot, with
the loſs of 40 Men on his ſide. This Defeat occaſioned an
agreement betwixt the King and Duke upon certain Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
of which the Eſtates were to be Guarrantees, and
the King promiſed to come forthwith to <hi>Stockholm</hi> to
ſettle the Affairs of the Kingdom, whither he would
needs go by Sea, tho' it was in <hi>October,</hi> but in lieu of
ſailing to <hi>Stockholm,</hi> directed his Courſe from <hi>Calmar</hi>
(where he was droven in by contrary Winds) to <hi>Dan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zick.</hi>
The Duke being ſurpriſed at this unexpected de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture,
called together the Eſtates of the Kingdom,
who having once more conſtituted him Regent of <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>
at their ſecond meeting at <hi>Stockholm,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1599.</note> renounced
their Obedience to King <hi>Sigiſmund,</hi> offering at the ſame
time the Crown to his Son <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ladiſlaus,</hi> in caſe he would
come within a twelve Months time into <hi>Sweden,</hi> and be
educated in the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Religion, but in caſe of fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure
he and his heirs to be excluded from the Crown.
Duke <hi>Charles</hi> thereupon marched againſt the <hi>Finns,</hi>
                  <pb n="510" facs="tcp:65650:281"/>
whom he quickly forced to Obedience, and having made
an Alliance with the <hi>Ruſſians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1600.</note> convened the Eſtates of the
Kingdom in the next following year at <hi>Sincoping,</hi> where
ſome of the Lords that were here, having before fled into
<hi>Poland,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> depoſed.</note> were condemned of High Treaſon and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted

(becauſe he had not appeared within the limited
time) excluded from the Succeſſion. About the ſame
time the Duke being certified that the <hi>Eaſtlanders.</hi> and
eſpecially thoſe of <hi>Reval</hi> were inclined to his ſide, he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
thither with a great Army, and being received
very joyfully by the Inhabitants of <hi>Reval,</hi> the
<hi>Poliſh</hi> Governours left the reſt of the places of <hi>Eſthland</hi>
voluntarily to the diſpoſition of <hi>Charles.</hi> The ſame for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
artended him at firſt in <hi>Livonia,</hi> where he took ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
places of note without much oppoſition, but was
forced to raiſe the Siege of <hi>Riga</hi> upon the approach of
the <hi>Poles,</hi> who retook <hi>Kakenhauſen</hi> and ſome other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
thereabouts. <hi>Charles</hi> having in the mean time got

aſſiſted him againſt the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> under pretence of
being afraid of the deſigns of the <hi>Poles</hi> againſt <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>
deſired to reſign. But theſe having firſt offered
the Crown to <hi>John</hi> King <hi>Sigiſmund</hi>'s half Brother,
who refuſed to accept of the ſame, they beſtowed it
upon <hi>Charles,</hi> who being the only Son left of King <hi>Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtave,</hi>
and by his Valour and Prudence having deſerved
ſo well of the Kingdom, the Crown was confirmed to
his Heirs even to the Females.<note place="margin">1604.</note> No ſooner was <hi>Charles</hi>
declared King,<note place="margin">Charles <hi>IX.</hi>
                  </note> but he undertook an Expedition into
<hi>Livonia,</hi> where he received a ſignal overthrow from the

to <hi>Sweden,</hi> if King <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> had not been prevented by
the inteſtine Commotions of the <hi>Poles</hi> to purſue his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.
The <hi>Ruſſians</hi> alſo had ſlain the falſe <hi>Demetrius,</hi>

Crown to <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ladiſlaus</hi> the Son of <hi>Sigiſmund,</hi> ſo that the

unite that Crown with <hi>Sweden</hi> than to leave it to his
Brother, was not only very ſlow in his Reſolution, but
alſo at laſt in his Anſwer to the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> only ſpoke of
his own coming thither, without mentioning his Brother,
which having been interpreted by the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> as if he
intended to make their Country a Province of <hi>Sweden,</hi>
they made one <hi>Michael Foedorowitz Romano</hi> their Grand
Duke, and when Prince <hi>Charles Philip</hi> afterwards came
into <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> ſome of them for a while adhered to him,
but the new Grand Duke having the ſtronger Party, the

                  </note> till
at laſt a Peace was concluded betwixt both Partys at
<hi>Stolbova,</hi> by the mediation of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> by vertue of

               <p>In the mean while a Truce had been concluded with
<hi>Poland</hi> for two years, but the ſame being near exſpiring,
King <hi>Guſtave Adolph</hi> reſolved to purſue the War againſt
the <hi>Poles</hi> with more vigour than before. The better to
put this Deſign in execution, he after his Coronation
had been performed at <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pſal</hi> with an univerſal Joy of
the People,<note place="margin">1617.</note> paid to <hi>Chriſtian</hi> King of <hi>Denmark</hi> the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
of the ſum due to him by vertue of the laſt Treaty of
Peace; and having married <hi>Mary Eleonora</hi> the Daughter
of <hi>John Sigiſmund</hi> Elector of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1620.</note> he attacked
the City of <hi>Riga,</hi> which defended it ſelf for ſix weeks
bravely, but being reduced to the laſt extremity, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred
it ſelf upon very honourable Terms. From
hence he ſailed towards <hi>Dantzick,</hi> to carry the War
into <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> but King <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> being then at <hi>Dant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zick,</hi>
the Truce was renewed for two years longer.
During the time of the Truce a Peace was propoſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
theſe two Crowns, which the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Eſtates were
very deſirous of, notwithſtanding which, King <hi>Sigiſmund</hi>
perſiſted in his former Reſolution of purſuing the War.
King <hi>Guſtave</hi> therefore again entred <hi>Livonia</hi> with a good
Army, where having defeated 3000 <hi>Lithuanians,</hi> who
under the Command of <hi>Staniſlaus Sariecha</hi> would have
diſputed his Paſſage, <hi>Kakenhauſen, Dorpt,</hi> and other
places of leſs note, ſurrendred themſelves to the King.
From hence he advanced into <hi>Lithuania,</hi> and took <hi>Bir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſew,</hi>
                  <pb n="513" facs="tcp:65650:282"/>
and tho' the <hi>Poles</hi> had nothing left in <hi>Livonia,</hi> but
only <hi>Duneburgh,</hi> and the <hi>Lithuanians</hi> were again defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the <hi>Swedes</hi> near <hi>Walſow</hi> in <hi>Sem-Gallia;</hi> King
<hi>Sigiſmund</hi> perſiſted in his Reſolution of carrying on the
War, being encouraged by the Emperour, who then
was very ſucceſsful in <hi>Germany.</hi> King <hi>Guſtave</hi> then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving
to give the <hi>Poles</hi> a home-ſtroke,<note place="margin">1626.</note> ſailed with a
Fleet of 80 Ships and 26000 Landmen towards the <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law,</hi>
where by Order of the Elector of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi>
having been received without oppoſition, he landed his
Men, and without any reſiſtance took <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> and
<hi>Frauenburgh.</hi> The next was <hi>Elbingen,</hi> where the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
having made ſome ſhew of reſiſtance, the Senate
ſurrendred the City without making as much as a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulation.
The ſame good Fortune attended him before
<hi>Marienburgh,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The War carried on againſt the <hi>Poles</hi> in <hi>Pruſſia.</hi>

                  <hi>Meve, Dirſhaw, Stum, Chriſtburgh</hi> and other
places in <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> which all fell into his hands, before
the <hi>Poles</hi> had notice of his arrival. Soon after the <hi>Poles</hi>
ſent 8000 Horſe and 3000 Foot into <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> who had
formed a deſign to ſurpriſe <hi>Marienburgh,</hi> but were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed

to attack <hi>Dantzick,</hi> but having received a ſhot
in the Belly before one of their out-works, he deſiſted
for that time, but ſoon after made himſelf Maſter of
the ſaid Fort, having firſt beaten the <hi>Poles</hi> that came
to its relief, who nevertheleſs, in the mean while had
forced <hi>Meve</hi> to a ſurrendry. Soon after, both Armies
encamped near <hi>Dirſhaw,</hi> where King <hi>Guſtave</hi> having
drawn out his Forces in Battel array, the <hi>Poles</hi> did the
like, having a boggy Ground before them, which the
King did not think fit to paſs with his Army; but when
the <hi>Poles</hi> began to draw off again into their Camp, the
King falling into the Rear, killed them a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Men. But ſome days after, attacking them in
their Camp, he received a ſhot in his left Shoulder with
a Muſquet Bullet, which his Forces being diſmayed at,
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:65650:283"/>
they returned without any further Action into their
Camp. Towards the latter end of the year, a new
Treaty having been ſet on foot betwixt the two Kings,
the Treaty was ſo far advanced, that King <hi>Sigiſmund</hi>
had reſolved to ſign it the next day, if the <hi>Auſtrians</hi>
(who did promiſe to ſend 24 Men of War and 12000
Men to his aſſiſtance) had not prevented it. After the
Treaty was broke off, King <hi>Guſtave,</hi> before his Army
went into Winter-quarters, took ſeveral places from the
<hi>Poles,</hi> and at the beginning of the year next following,
attacked a Fort near <hi>Dantzick,</hi> but was repulſed with
loſs. Soon after he had a ſmart Engagement with the
<hi>Poles,</hi> wherein 3000 of them were killed upon the ſpot,
the <hi>Swedes</hi> having taken four pieces of Cannon, and four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Standards, tho' not without great blood-ſhed on
their ſide. Then the King advanced nearer unto <hi>Dant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zick,</hi>
having ſent eight Men of War to block up that
Harbour, but the <hi>Dantzickers</hi> with ten Men of War
having attacked the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Squadron, they killed the
<hi>Swediſh</hi> Admiral <hi>Nils Sternſhield,</hi> took his Ship, forced
their Vice-Admiral to blow up his own Ship, and put
the reſt to flight, tho' the <hi>Dantzickers</hi> alſo loſt their Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
and 400 Men in this Engagement. King <hi>Guſtave</hi> then
having detached 1000 foot Souldiers, who paſſed the
<hi>Veixel</hi> in Boats, they ſurpriſed <hi>Niewburgh,</hi> which being
a Magazin of the <hi>Poles,</hi> they took moſt of their Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
and 600000 Crowns in Money.<note place="margin">1629.</note> But in the year
next following, he gave them more work; for <hi>Herman
Wrangel</hi> raiſed the Blockade of <hi>Brodnitz</hi> where 3000
<hi>Poles</hi> were killed, 1000 taken Priſoners, with five Pieces
of Cannon and 2000 Waggons with Proviſion. The
<hi>Poles</hi> being frightened at this Defeat, were very deſirous
then to receive the Imperial Forces which were ſent to
their Aſſiſtance under the command of <hi>Arnheim,</hi> who
with 5000 Foot and 2000 Horſe, joined <hi>Koniccpoliski,</hi>
the <hi>Poliſh</hi> General near <hi>Graudentz.</hi> King <hi>Guſtave</hi> on
the other hand encamped with an Army of 5000 Horſe
and 8000 Foot near <hi>Quidzin;</hi> and tho' the <hi>Swedes</hi> were
much inferiour in number, yet did they not refuſe the
Combate; and both Armies ſoon after having met near

them, wherein the <hi>Swed<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="515" facs="tcp:65650:283"/>
with the loſs of five Standards, but the King coming up
in Perſon with more Forces, ſoon forced the <hi>Poles</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat,
who would have paſſed over a Bridge which
they were laying over the River of <hi>Nogat.</hi> But King
<hi>Guſtave</hi> endavouring to cut off their retreat that way, the
Fight was renewed on both ſides with great fury, ſo that
the King venturing himſelf too far, was taken hold of by
his Shoulder-belt, which he ſlipping over his head, got
free of them, leaving his Hat and Belt behind him.
But immediately after, another catching hold of his
Arm. would have carried him off, if one <hi>Erick Soop</hi> had
not ſhot the <hi>Polander,</hi> and delivered the King. In this
Action the <hi>Swedes</hi> got ſeventeen Colours and five Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dards,
the Imperial Forces having received the greateſt
damage. Not long after, there happened another En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement
about the ſame Bridge, where the <hi>Poles</hi> were
again repulſed, and in the attack of <hi>Stum,</hi> they loſt
4000 Men of their beſt Forces. The <hi>Poles</hi> having im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted

King only waited an opportunity to put this Deſign in

For <hi>Albert Wallenſtein,</hi> Duke of <hi>Friedland,</hi> the <hi>Imperial</hi>

Thither King <hi>Guſtave</hi> ſent ſome of his Miniſters

in declaring himſelf poſitively, pretending ſeveral reaſons,

League, and in the mean while to take this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of putting the Proteſtants in a good poſture,
and to keep the ballance betwixt the Emperour and the
<hi>Swedes.</hi> King <hi>Guſtave</hi> therefore perceiving that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants

thought it his beſt not to venture his Army at

to have relieved the City of <hi>Magdeburgh,</hi> which was
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:65650:285"/>
reduced to extremity, yet did he not think it adviſable
to march thither before he had ſecured his retreat. To
render therefore his deſign effectual, he marched with his
Army ſtrait to <hi>Berlin,</hi> and having obliged the Elector of

been but 400 left of a great many thouſands. After
this Diſaſter, King <hi>Guſtave</hi> having publiſhed his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
why he could not timely enough relieve that City,
and having cleared the whole <hi>Pomerania</hi> of the <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialiſts,</hi>
he divided his Army, and having ſent part of his
Forces to the aſſiſtance the Dukes of <hi>Mecklenburgh,</hi> he
marched with the reſt into <hi>Marck</hi> and encamped at
<hi>Werben</hi> near the River <hi>Elbe,</hi> to obſerve <hi>Tilly,</hi> who
having received Intelligence of the King's arrival near
that River, was obliged to alter his march (which he
intended to have directed towards <hi>Saxony)</hi> in hopes to
force the King to a Battel. But the King ſurpriſed his
Avaint-Guard near <hi>Wolmerſtadt,</hi> where he totally ruin'd
three Regiments of Horſe. Notwithſtanding which,
<hi>Tilly</hi> approached near the King's Camp at <hi>Werben,</hi> but the
King refuſing of fight, and he not daring to attack him
in his Camp, he was for want of Forrage, obliged to
march back to his former Camp at <hi>Wolmerſtadt.</hi> In the
mean while the Dukes of <hi>Mecklenburgh</hi> had with the
aſſiſtance of the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Auxiliaries driven the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi>
out of their Territories, except <hi>Domitz, Wiſmar</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtock,</hi>
which places they alſo kept block'd up. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the ſame time <hi>James</hi> Marquis of <hi>Hamilton</hi> came
with 6000 <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> into <hi>Pomerania,</hi> but ſtood
the King in no great ſtead, moſt of them dying in the
ſame year by ſeveral Diſeaſes. But <hi>Tilly</hi> ſeeing that he
could not attack the King near <hi>Werben,</hi> decamped from
<hi>Wolmerſtadt</hi> and marched to <hi>Eiſleben,</hi> and from thence
to <hi>Halli,</hi> from whence he marched with 40000 Men
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:65650:286"/>
to <hi>Leipſick,</hi> which he took ſoon after. The Elector of
<hi>Saxony</hi> being thus put to a nonplus, was then forced to
ſend to King <hi>Guſtave,</hi> and to deſire him to join his Army
which lay encamped near <hi>Torgawi,</hi> the King who had
foreſeen what would befal him, being already advanced
near <hi>New Brandenburgh;</hi> and tho' the King was very glad
of this opportunity, yet becauſe the Elector being now
put to a nonplus, now deſired what he had reſuſed
before, he propoſed to him certain Conditions, which
the Elector having readily granted, he paſſed the River
<hi>Elbe</hi> near <hi>Wittenbergh</hi> with 13000 Foot and 9000 Horſe,
and joined the Elector near <hi>Dieben.</hi> Then a Council
of War having been called (where the Elector of <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburgh</hi>
alſo was preſent) the King, who did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
that the old cunning General would give them
any opportunity to fight, was for acting very cautiouſly;
but the Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> was not for protracting the
War, telling them that if the reſt refuſed he would
fight alone: This opinion at laſt prevailed, the King
then thought it moſt convenient to attack him imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
before he could be joined by the Generals <hi>Altrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi>
and <hi>Tieffenbach,</hi> the firſt of which was already ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
near <hi>Erffurt,</hi> the ſecond being on his march out
of <hi>Sileſia.</hi> Thereupon the command of the right Wing
being left to the King, that of the left to the Electors,
they marched towards the Enemy. <hi>Tilly</hi> had no ſooner
been informed of their approach, but he began to fortifie
himſelf in his Camp near <hi>Leipzick.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Battel near <hi>Leipzick.</hi> 7. <hi>Sept.</hi>
                  </note> But <hi>Papenheim</hi> and

out by long march would by all means fight the Enemy
in the Plains near <hi>Braitenfeld,</hi> where <hi>Tilly</hi> loſt the fruits
of his former Victories. He had poſſeſſed himſelf of all
the riſing Grounds where he had planted his Cannon,
and had alſo the advantage of the Wind; but King
<hi>Guſtave</hi> who had put ſome Battalions of Foot among the
Squadrons of Horſe, by wheeling about, got the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of the Wind from him, and having obliged the
<hi>Imperialiſts</hi> to open their left Wing, <hi>John Banner</hi> fell in
among them and brought them into confuſion. But the

                  <pb n="521" facs="tcp:65650:286"/>
whoſe Infantry and ſome of the Militia Horſe were put
to flight, which obliged the King to fall with his Wing
upon the Enemy's Horſe that were in purſuit of the
<hi>Saxons,</hi> whom he quickly alſo forced to fly. But the
Imperial Infantry ſtill held out, till <hi>Guſtave</hi>'s Horſe with
ſome Squadrons of the right Wing fell into their Flank;
and the King about the ſame time having taken all the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy's
Artillery, they were put to an entire rout on all
ſides, leaving 7600 Men dead upon the ſpot, beſides
what was killed in the purſuit, 5000 Priſoners took Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
under the King. <hi>Tilly</hi> himſelf who refuſed Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
was likely to have been killed by a Captain of
Horſe, if <hi>Rodulf Maximiliun</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxon-Lauenburgh</hi>
had not delivered him by ſhooting the Captain thro' the
head. The <hi>Swedes</hi> took above 100 Standards and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
but loſt 2000 Men moſt of them Horſe; the <hi>Saxons</hi>
loſt 3000, who quickly retook <hi>Leipzick,</hi> whileſt the
King marched towards <hi>Merſeburgh,</hi> where he out to
pieces 1000 of the Enemies, and took 500 Priſoners.
Then it was reſolved at a Council of War held at <hi>Halle,</hi>
not to follow <hi>Tilly,</hi> who was retired towards the River
of <hi>Weſer,</hi> but to carry their victorious Arms into the
Emperour's hereditary, and other Roman Catholick
Countries thereabouts. After ſome diſpute it was agreed
that the King ſhould march towards <hi>Franconia,</hi> whileſt
the Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> entred the hereditary Countries of
the Emperour. Purſuant to this agreement, the King
marched towards <hi>Erffurt,</hi> (where <hi>William</hi> Duke of <hi>Wei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi>
was received without oppoſition) and from thence
into <hi>Franconia,</hi> where he took <hi>Koningſhofen</hi> and <hi>Swein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furt</hi>
without any oppoſition, and the Caſtle of <hi>Wurtz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi>
after ſome reſiſtance. In the mean while <hi>Tilly</hi> the
Imperial General having been reinforced by ſeveral Troops
that were before diſperſed in <hi>Germany,</hi> was come to the
relief of <hi>Wurtzburgh,</hi> but coming too late, marched to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the River of the <hi>Tauber</hi> to cover the <hi>Bavarian</hi> and
the Emperour's hereditary Countries on that ſide, but in
his march the <hi>Swedes</hi> falling into his Rear, cut off four
entire Regiments. The King having then made an Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
with the Marquis of <hi>Anſpach</hi> marched towards the
<hi>Rhine,</hi> ſurpriſed <hi>Hanaw,</hi> but <hi>Franckfort</hi> on the River of

<pb n="522" facs="tcp:65650:287"/>
of the whole Country of <hi>Ringau,</hi> directed his march
into the Palatinate, which was then in the poſſeſſion of
the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> Soon after entring the <hi>Berghſtrate</hi> he
took <hi>Gerſheim,</hi> and paſſed the <hi>Rhine</hi> near <hi>Stockſtadt,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
defeated the <hi>Spaniards</hi> that would have diſputed
his Paſſage, and at <hi>Oppenheim</hi> he cut 500 <hi>Spaniards</hi> in

and <hi>Landaw, Spiers, Weiſſenburgh</hi> and <hi>Mainheim,</hi>
fell ſoon after into the King's hands. <hi>Roſtock</hi> alſo and
<hi>Wiſmar</hi> having in the mean while been ſurredred, the
<hi>Baltick</hi> Sea-Coaſt was cleared from the <hi>Imperialiſts.</hi>
And the Members of the Circle of the <hi>Lower Saxony</hi> at
an Aſſembly held at <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> had reſolved to levy
6000 Foot and 500 Horſe for the defence of that Circle.
The Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> in the mean while having refuſed
the offers made to him by the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadour, had
ſent his Army under the command of Lieutenant General
<hi>Arnheim</hi> into <hi>Bohemia,</hi> where among other places they
had taken the City of <hi>Prague;</hi> but having conceived a
jealouſy againſt the King (whom he ſuſpected to aim at
the Imperial Crown) he could not be prevailed upon to
march further into <hi>Moravia</hi> and <hi>Auſtria.</hi> And the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
Court ſeeing that <hi>Tilly</hi> was no more able to cope
with the King, reſolved to give the ſupreme Command
of the Imperial Forces to <hi>Wallenſtein,</hi> who being an old
experienced Souldier, and in great Authority among the
Souldiers, had beſides this gathered ſuch riches that he
was able to raiſe an Army at his own charge. He having
been at laſt prevailed upon to take upon him the ſupreme
Command, raiſed an Army of 40000 Men againſt the
next Spring.<note place="margin">1637.</note> But whileſt theſe Preparations were making
at <hi>Vienna,</hi> the King's Forces, notwithſtanding the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Seaſon, having beaten the <hi>Spaniards</hi> upon the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle,</hi>
had taken <hi>Creutznach, Braunfels Kobenhauſen</hi> and
<hi>Kirchbergh,</hi> and the King having left the ſupreme dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Affairs on the <hi>Rhine</hi> to <hi>Axel Oxenſtirn,</hi> he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
towards the Spring marched into <hi>Franconia.</hi> But
<hi>Tilly</hi> at his approach, retired on the other ſide the <hi>Danube,</hi>
the King poſſeſſed himſelf of all the places along that
River as far as <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lm,</hi> from whence he marched towards
the River of <hi>Lech,</hi> where <hi>Tilly</hi> had entrenched himſelf
in a Foreſt on the other ſide of that River. Here it was
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:65650:287"/>
that General <hi>Tilly</hi> was wounded by a Canon Bullet,
of which he died in a few days after at <hi>Ingolſtadt.</hi>
His Army being diſmayed at the loſs of their General
left their advantageous Poſt, and the <hi>Swedes</hi> having cut
1000 of them in pieces in their retreat marched ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
into the Country of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> where they took
poſſeſſion of <hi>Raio,</hi> and <hi>Niewburgh</hi> upon the <hi>Danube.
Augsburgh</hi> ſurrendred without much reſiſtance. But
their deſign upon <hi>Ingolſtadt</hi> and <hi>Ratisbonne</hi> miſcarried,
being repulſed at the firſt, where the King's Horſe was
ſhot under him, and <hi>Chriſtopher</hi> the Marquis of <hi>Baden</hi>
killed by his ſide, but the latter the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi>
had ſecured by throwing ſome of his Forces into the
place. The King therefore returning into <hi>Bavaria</hi> ſet that
Country under Contribution, and the City of <hi>Municken</hi>
opened its Gates to the King. In the mean while Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<hi>Wallenſtein,</hi> having left the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi>
a while to ſhift for himſelf, had driven the <hi>Saxons</hi> out
of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> by the treachery of their General <hi>Arnheim,</hi>
who was an utter Enemy of King <hi>Guſtave,</hi> and the
<hi>Imperialiſts</hi> under Lieutenant General <hi>Pappenheim</hi> had
made conſiderable progreſſes in the Circle of the <hi>Lower
Saxony, Wallenſtein</hi> alſo had taken a reſolution to fall
with all his Forces upon the King in the Country of
<hi>Bavaria.</hi> Purſuant to this reſolution, the Elector of
<hi>Bavaria</hi> having left a ſufficient Garriſon at <hi>Ingolſtadt</hi>
and <hi>Ratisbonne,</hi> marched towards <hi>Egen</hi> to join <hi>Wallen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein,</hi>
whom the King purſued in hopes to hinder their
conjunction, but coming too late, he encamped near
<hi>Numbergh,</hi> till he could be joined by his Forces that
were diſperſed in ſeveral parts of <hi>Germany. Wallenſtein</hi>
then made a ſhew as if he would turn his Arms againſt
the Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> thereby to draw the King out
of his advantageous Poſt near that City; but the King
remaining in his Poſt he marched towards him, ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Cavalry all round about, which occaſioned
a great ſcarcity of Forage in the King's Camp, but as for
Proviſions he was ſufficiently ſupplyed withal from
<hi>Numbergh.</hi> Whilſt the King was reduced to theſe
Straits he received a reinforcement of 15000 Foot, and
10000 Horſe from ſeveral places, ſo that being now
ſuperiour in number he attacked <hi>Wallenſtein</hi> in his Camp,
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:65650:288"/>
who being ſtrongly Entrenched repalſed the <hi>Swedes</hi> with
the loſs of 2000 Men. In the mean time the <hi>Imperial</hi>
General <hi>Pappenheim</hi> had beat the <hi>Heſſians</hi> near <hi>Volck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marſen,</hi>
had forced the Duke of <hi>Lunenburgh</hi> to raiſe the
Siege of <hi>Callenbergh,</hi> had beat General <hi>Baudiſt</hi> from
before <hi>Paterborn</hi> and <hi>Hoxter,</hi> had relieved <hi>Wolffenbuttel,</hi>
and taken <hi>Hildeſheim,</hi> from whence he was marched
into <hi>Thuringia,</hi> to join <hi>Wallenſtein.</hi> On the other hand
the <hi>Saxons</hi> were entred <hi>Sileſia</hi> with an Army of 16000
Men, where meeting with no oppoſition, they might
have carried all before them, if their General <hi>Arnheim</hi>
had not been treacherous to King <hi>Guſtave,</hi> whom he
hated, and was for working a reconciliation betwixt the
Emperour and the Elector of <hi>Saxony.</hi> The King there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
not to loſe any more time, having put a good Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
into <hi>Numbergh,</hi> reſolved to ſend part of his Army
into <hi>Franconia,</hi> and with the main Body to return to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the <hi>Danube</hi> into <hi>Bavaria,</hi> where he had taken
ſeveral places on the River of <hi>Lech.</hi> But whilſt he was
carrying on his victorious Arms among the <hi>Roman</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks,
frequent Meſſengers were ſent to him by the
Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> craving his aſſiſtance againſt <hi>Wallen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein,</hi>
who was with all his Forces entred into <hi>Miſnia.</hi>
The King though he had great reaſon to be diſſatisfied
with the Elector, yet fearing he might be forced to
make a ſeparate Peace with the Emperour, if he did not
come to his aſſiſtance; he having left ſome Forces in
<hi>Bavaria</hi> and <hi>Suabia,</hi> under the Command of <hi>Paltſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave
Chriſtian</hi> of <hi>Berckenfeld,</hi> and commanded <hi>Guſtave
Horn</hi> to remain in <hi>Alſatia,</hi> where he forced <hi>Benfelden</hi> to
ſurrender, (as <hi>Franckenthal</hi> was about the ſame time
forced to ſurrender by Famine) himſelf marched with

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>gh</hi>
he received information that the Enemies had raiſed the
Siege of <hi>Werſſenfels,</hi> and that they had detached <hi>Pap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penheim</hi>
with ſome Forces upon another deſign. Having
therefore reſolved not to ſtay for the Duke of <hi>Lunen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi>
who being already arrived at <hi>Wittenbergh,</hi> was
to have joined him, but to fight the Enemy before he
could be rejoined by <hi>Pappenheim.</hi> Purſuant to this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
he marched to the great Plains near <hi>Lutzen,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Battel near <hi>Lutzen. Nov.</hi> 6.</note>
where a moſt bloody Battel was fought betwixt them,
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:65650:288"/>
in which the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Infantry fell with ſuch fury upon
the <hi>Imperial</hi> Foot that they routed them, and made
themſelves Maſters of their Cannon. But the <hi>Swediſh</hi>
Horſe being ſtopt by a broad Ditch, (that was cut croſs
the Plains for the conveniency of floating of Wood)
the King put himſelf at the Head of the <hi>Smaland</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment
of Horſe, encouraging the reſt by his example
to follow him. Thus furiouſly advancing before the reſt,
and being only accompanyed by <hi>Francis Albucret</hi> Duke
of <hi>Saxen Launenburgh,</hi> and two Grooms, he there loſt
his life. Concerning his death there are different opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
but the moſt probable is, that he was ſhot by the
ſaid Duke of <hi>Lauenburgh,</hi> who was ſet on by the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts</hi>
that had their only hopes in the King's death.
The <hi>Swedes</hi> were ſo far from being diſmayed at the King's
death,<note place="margin">King <hi>Guſtave Adolfe</hi> kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</note> that they fell with great fury again upon the
Enemy, whom they routed on all ſides. The <hi>Imperia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts</hi>
having been rejoined by <hi>Pappenheim</hi> would have
rallied again, but <hi>Pappenheim</hi> having alſo been killed,
they were routed a ſecond time, leaving an entire Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
to the <hi>Swedes,</hi> which was nevertheleſs dearly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed
by the death of ſo great a King.</p>
               <p>§ 15.<note place="margin">Chriſtina.</note> The death of this great King cauſed great al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations
in <hi>Europe,</hi> for, though the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> had loſt
the Battel and a great many brave Officers,<note place="margin">1633.</note> yet were
they in no ſmall hopes that the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Affairs would
now ſink under their own weight, and therefore made
great preparations againſt them the next Campagne. The
Proteſtants in <hi>Germany</hi> were by his death divided into
ſeveral Factions, not knowing whom they ſhould chooſe
for their Head, and the <hi>Swedes</hi> overwhelmed with trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
his Daughter <hi>Chriſtina</hi> being then but ſix years of
Age. Nevertheleſs, having ſettled their Affairs at
Home, and committed the Adminiſtration of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to the five chief Officers of the State, the chief
management of the Affairs in <hi>Germany</hi> was committed
to the care of the Lord Chancellour <hi>Oxenſtirn,</hi> who
having been ſent by the King's order into the higher <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>
received this ſad News at <hi>Hanau.</hi> The Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour
did not ſo much fear the Power of his Enemies

<pb n="526" facs="tcp:65650:289"/>
the Proteſtants were divided in their Counſels and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
and were not likely to follow his directions after
the King's death, it being not probable that the Electors
and Princes of the Empire would be commanded by a
Foreign Nobleman; nevertheleſs he thought it not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſable,
by leaving their Conqueſts, to ruin at once the
Proteſtant Cauſe and the Intereſt of <hi>Sweden,</hi> but rather
to endeavour by a brave reſiſtance to obtain an honorable
Peace. Having therefore ſent ſome Regiments back into
<hi>Sweden,</hi> he divided his Army, and having ſent 14000
Men under the Command of <hi>George</hi> Duke of <hi>Lunen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi>
into the Lower <hi>Saxony</hi> and <hi>Weſtphalia,</hi> the laſt
were ordered into <hi>Franconia,</hi> and ſome Forces were alſo
detached towards <hi>Sileſia.</hi> Theſe Forces acted with

where the Duke of <hi>Lunenburgh</hi> took ſeveral
places, defeated the Earl of <hi>Mansfeld</hi> near <hi>Rinteln</hi> and
beſieged the City of <hi>Hamelen.</hi> But in <hi>Sileſia</hi> the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Cauſe was not carried on with the ſame forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
by reaſon of the miſunderſtanding betwixt the
<hi>Swediſh</hi> and <hi>Saxon</hi> Generals, the latter of which keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a ſecret Correſpondency with <hi>Wallenſtein,</hi> left the
<hi>Swedes</hi> in the Lurch, who were at laſt miſerably beaten
by the ſaid <hi>Wallenſtein.</hi> But in all other places they
had better ſucceſs, where their Generals took ſeveral
places of note, and the Duke of <hi>Lunenburgh</hi> had alſo
retaken the ſtrong City of <hi>Hamelen</hi> by accord, after
having defeated 15000 <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> that were coming to
its relief, whereof 2000 were killed upon the ſpot, and
as many taken Priſoners. Thus the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Army were
every where flouriſhing but in <hi>Sileſia,</hi> nevertheleſs the
burthen of the War grew heavier upon them every

the War, and willing to be rid of the <hi>Swedes.</hi> Whilſt
they laboured under theſe difficulties, <hi>Wallenſtein</hi> being
faln in diſgrace and killed by the Emperour's order, they
hoped to reap ſome advantage by this Change, but the
Emperour having made the King of <hi>Hungary</hi> (his Son)

the ſame not being to be obtained in <hi>Germany</hi> they
were fain to prolong the Truce with the <hi>Poles</hi> for twenty
ſix years,<note place="margin">Truce pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed with the <hi>Poles.</hi>
                  </note> and to reſtore to them their ſo dearly beloved
<hi>Pruſſia,</hi> and to draw <hi>France</hi> into <hi>Germany</hi> to their aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
to put them in the Poſſeſſion of <hi>Philipsburgh.</hi>
Thus having in a manner ſettled their Affairs, the War
broke out betwixt them and the Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> who
offered them a recompence of mony for the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhoprick
of <hi>Magdeburgh,</hi> which the <hi>Swedes</hi> refuſing
to accept of, there happened a ſharp Engagement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them near <hi>Allenburgh</hi> upon the <hi>Elbe,</hi> where of

                  <note place="margin">War be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Swedes</hi> and Elector of <hi>Saxony.</hi>
                  </note> one half were killed, and the reſt taken
Priſoners. Notwithſtanding this advantage the <hi>Swedes</hi>
had no ſmall obſtacles to ſurmount, ſince the Emperour
was in Poſſeſſion of the whole Upper <hi>Germany,</hi> and
had beſides this ſet the Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> upon their
Back, which obliged the <hi>Swedes</hi> to take new Meaſures,
and being now left by all their Confederates, they were
at liberty at leaſt to act more unanimouſly, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
with leſs force, the effects of which appeared ſoon
after; for though the Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> had the good
fortune to retake <hi>Magdeburgh</hi> from the <hi>Swedes,</hi> yet they
ſoon after revenged this loſs near <hi>Perlebergh</hi> where they
attacked the ſaid Elector with a leſs number in his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
Camp, and having routed his Army killed 5000
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:65650:290"/>
upon the ſpot, beſides what were killed in the purſuit,
1100 being killed on the <hi>Swediſh</hi> ſide, and 3000
wounded, and having ſoon after droven the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi>
out of <hi>Heſſia</hi> into <hi>Weſtphalia,</hi> and regained <hi>Erffurt,</hi>
they were again in a fair way to get footing in <hi>High Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</hi>
They had alſo in the next enſuing year ſeveral
Encounters with the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> and <hi>Saxons,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1637.</note> which
proved moſt to their advantage, <hi>Banner</hi> having defeated
eight <hi>Saxon</hi> Regiments near <hi>Edlenburgh,</hi> and ſoon after
2000 more near <hi>Pegau,</hi> and when the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> thought
to have got him with his whole Army into their
Clutches near <hi>Cuſtrin,</hi> he got off with great dexterity,
but could not prevent, but that the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> took
ſeveral places in <hi>Pomerania,</hi> as alſo near the Rivers of
<hi>Havel</hi> and <hi>Elbe; George</hi> Duke of <hi>Lunenburgh</hi> having

the laſt Duke of <hi>Pomerania,</hi> (who dyed this year) an
Alliance was concluded betwixt them and <hi>France</hi> for
three years.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Swedes</hi> having been brought the year before
ſomewhat in the ſtraits,<note place="margin">1638.</note> they now,<note place="margin">Alliance with <hi>France.</hi>
                  </note> after having received
freſh Recruits began to recover what they had loſt the
year before, <hi>Banner</hi> having driven <hi>Gallas</hi> the <hi>Imperial</hi>
General back even into the Hereditary Countries of the
Emperour. And <hi>Bernhard</hi> Duke of <hi>Weimar</hi> had the
ſame ſucceſs on the <hi>Rhine,</hi> where having beſieged <hi>Rhine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felden,</hi>
he fought twice with the <hi>Imperialiſts,</hi> that came
to its relief, and having routed them in the ſecond En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement
took <hi>Rhinefelden, Kuteln</hi> and <hi>Fryburgh</hi> in
<hi>Briſgau.</hi> After this exploit having blocked up <hi>Briſack</hi>
ſo cloſely that it was reduced to the utmoſt by Famine,
the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> endeavoured to relieve it with 12000
Men, which were ſo received by the ſaid Duke that
ſcarce 2500 eſcaped. And not long after the Duke
of <hi>Loraine</hi> having attempted its relief with 3500
Men, the ſame were alſo cut in pieces, and the
place ſurrendred to the Duke. The <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> having
been thus routed both near the <hi>Rhine</hi> and in the <hi>Lower
Saxony,</hi> the Duke and <hi>John Banner</hi> had both taken a
reſolution to carry the War into the Emperour's Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:65650:290"/>
Countries, and <hi>Banner</hi> marched ſtraitways (after
ſeveral Defeats given to the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> and <hi>Saxons)</hi>
into <hi>Bohemia,</hi> where he in all likelihood might have had
great ſucceſs if the untimely death of Duke <hi>Bernhard</hi>
(who was to join him) had not broke his Meaſures.
This Duke being ſollicited by the <hi>French</hi> to ſurrender
<hi>Briſack</hi> into their Hands, (which he refuſed) was
Poiſoned by them, and his Army with great promiſes
and mony debauched to ſubmit under the <hi>French</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.
The <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> then growing too ſtrong for <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>
alone in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> he marched back into <hi>Miſnia</hi>
and <hi>Thuringia,</hi> and having been joined by the Duke of
<hi>Longueville,</hi> who Commanded the Army of the lately
deceaſed Duke of <hi>Weimar</hi> and by ſome <hi>Heſſians</hi> and
<hi>Lunenburghers</hi> near <hi>Erffurt</hi> (which made up an Army of
21 Brigades and 2000 Horſe) he would fain have Fought
the <hi>Imperialiſts,</hi> but theſe avoiding to come to a Battel
the Campagne was moſt ſpent in marching up and down
the Country. But at the beginning of the next enſuing
year <hi>Banner</hi> had very near ſurpriſed the City of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisbonne,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1641.</note>
where the Emperour and the Eſtates of the
Empire were then aſſembled, if the Ice which was by
which was by a ſudden Thaw looſned in the River, had
not hindred them from laying a Bridge of Boats, which
deſign having miſcarried, <hi>Banner</hi> reſolved to carry the
War again into <hi>Moravia, Sileſia,</hi> and <hi>Bohemia.</hi> But
the <hi>Weimarian</hi> Forces under the Command of the
<hi>French</hi> General having left him thereabouts, the <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialiſts</hi>
had ſo cloſely beſet him, that there was no way
left to retreat but through the Foreſt of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> which
was done with all expedition, having left Colonel <hi>Slange,</hi>
with three Regiments of Horſe behind, who after a
brave reſiſtance were all made Priſoners of War, but
ſaved the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Army, which would elſe have been in
great danger if they had not detained the <hi>Imperialiſts,</hi>
the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Army being arrived but half an hour before
them at the Paſs of <hi>Preſſwitz,</hi> where they ſtopt the
Enemies march. Not long after dyed the famous
<hi>Swediſh</hi> General <hi>John Banner,</hi>

<pb n="530" facs="tcp:65650:291"/>

and a great many other places, the chiefeſt of which
was <hi>Sweinitz,</hi> where he defeated the <hi>Imperialiſts,</hi> that
came to its relief, under the Command of <hi>Francis Albert</hi>
Duke of <hi>Saxon Lauenburgh,</hi> who was killed himſelf
and 3000 Horſe. Afterwards he beſieged <hi>Brieg,</hi> but
was forced to raiſe that Siege, the <hi>Imperialists</hi> being
ſuperiour in number, who alſo prevented him from
marching into <hi>Bohemia.</hi> Wherefore having directed his
March towards the <hi>Elbe,</hi> and paſſed that River at <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaw,</hi>
he ſtraightways went to beſiege the City of <hi>Leip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zick.</hi>
But the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> under the Command of the

                  </note> and General <hi>Piccolomini</hi> coming to its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
a bloody Battel was fought in the ſame Plains near

Right Wing, they put them to the rout, 5000 be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

The <hi>Swedes</hi> loſt 2000 Men, and had a great many
wounded. After the loſs of this Battel <hi>Leipzick</hi> was
ſoon forced to ſurrender, but <hi>Freybergh</hi> (which was ſoon

that the <hi>Swedes,</hi> upon the approach of the <hi>Imperial</hi>

were agreed on formerly at <hi>Rocſhild,</hi> except that the
<hi>Danes</hi> kept the Iſle of <hi>Bornholm,</hi> and <hi>Druntheim</hi> in
<hi>Norway.</hi> For the reſt, the <hi>Swedes</hi> were for preſerving
Peace with their Neighbours during the minority of the
King, till having broke off the Triple Alliance made
betwixt them, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> they ſided
with <hi>France</hi> againſt the Elector of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1674.</note> whom
they pretended, by ſending an Army into his Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
to draw from the Intereſt of the Empire. But
this occaſioned a heavy War to the King, at the very
beginning of his Reign,<note place="margin">The <hi>Swedes</hi> routed by the Elector of <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh.</hi>
                  </note> wherein the Elector having
routed the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Army, took all what the <hi>Swedes</hi> were
poſſeſſed of in <hi>Pomerania,</hi> as the <hi>Lunenburghers</hi> got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their poſſeſſion the Dukedoms of <hi>Bremen</hi> and <hi>Veer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>
and the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> the City of <hi>Wiſmar,</hi>
                  <pb n="535" facs="tcp:65650:293"/>
and ſeveral conſiderable places in <hi>Shonen,</hi> but the <hi>Danes</hi>
having at laſt been routed at two Battels in <hi>Shonen,</hi> the
King after the Treaty of <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> by a particular Peace
was put again into the poſſeſſion of his Countries in
<hi>Germany,</hi> very few excepted, and <hi>Denmark</hi> was forced
alſo to reſtore the places taken from the <hi>Swedes</hi> in
<hi>Shonen.</hi> This Peace having been again ſettled in <hi>Sweden,</hi>
the King married <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lrica Eleanora</hi> the preſent King of
<hi>Denmark</hi>'s Siſter, ſince which time the King has chiefly

and to maintain the Peace with his Neighbours.<note place="margin">1678.</note>

               <p>§ 18.<note place="margin">The nature and qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> The <hi>Swediſh</hi> and <hi>Gothick</hi> Nation has antiently
been famous for Warlike Archievements, and is very fit
to endure the Fatigues of War; yet were their Military
Affairs in former times but very indifferently ordered,
their chiefeſt Force conſiſting in the Boors, till <hi>Guſtave</hi>
and his Succeſſours with the aſſiſtance of ſome <hi>Scotch</hi> and
<hi>German</hi> Officers and Souldiers have introduced ſuch a
Diſcipline as that now they do not ſtand in ſo much
need of foreign Souldiers, except it be to make up the
number of Men, wherewith they are not overſtock'd,
eſpecially ſince the late great Wars. As in moſt other
Kingdoms of <hi>Europe,</hi> by reaſon of the multitude of their
populous Cities, the Eſtate of the Citizens is the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
part of the State, ſo is in <hi>Sweden</hi> that of the Boors,
who enjoy more liberty in <hi>Sweden</hi> than in other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
and alſo ſend their Deputies to the Dyet, where
their conſent is requiſite to any new Taxes to be levied
upon the Subjects.</p>
               <p>This Nation loves to ſhew a great deal of gravity
and reſervedneſs, which if not qualified by converſation
with other Nations, often degenerates into miſtruſtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
They generally are apt to think very well of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and to deſpiſe others. They have ſufficient Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
to attain to the firſt Principles of any Art or Science,
but commonly want Patience to attain to the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of them. Their inclination is not much to Trade
or Handy-work, and therefore Manufacturies are but
little encouraged among them.</p>

§ 19.<note place="margin">Condition of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and its Strength.</note> The Kingdom of <hi>Sweden</hi> is of a great extent,
but full of great Foreſts and innumerable Lakes, and the
Sea-Coaſt ſurrounded with many Rocks. But deeper
into the Country, there are a great many fertile tracts
of Ground, the Foreſts furniſh them with Fuel, and the
Lakes with great ſtore of good Fiſh, which alſo contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
much to the eaſie tranſportation of the Native Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
from one place to another. The Country pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
Corn ſufficient for its Inhabitants, neither is there
any want of Cattel or Horſes. <hi>Sweden</hi> produces more
Copper and Iron than any other Kingdom in the World,
and their Mines are fitted by nature for that purpoſe,
being ſurrounded with Woods and Rivulets. There is
a Silver Mine in <hi>Weſtmanland. Finland</hi> brings forth
Pitch, and Tar, and Deal; and <hi>Wermeland</hi> good ſtore
of Maſts. The Native Commodities of <hi>Sweden</hi> are
Copper, Iron, Tar, Pitch, Maſts, Boards <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In lieu
of which, <hi>Sweden</hi> receives from abroad Wine, Brandy,
Salt, Spices, Cloaths, Silk and Woollen Stuffs, fine Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen
Cloath, <hi>French</hi> Manufactories of all ſorts, Furs, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and ſuch like, all which in ſome years ſurpaſſes in
value the Commodities fit for exportation here. To
recompence this, Navigation and Commerce has been
encouraged of late years among the Natives, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
ſorts of Manufactories, whereof thoſe made of Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
Iron and Braſs would queſtionleſs turn to the beſt
account, if theſe Artiſts were duely encouraged to ſettle
themſelves in this Kingdom, Copper and Iron being the
foundation of the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Commerce abroad. This
preſent King has put their Forces both Horſe and Foot in
a better Condition than ever they were before, which
are maintained in <hi>Sweden,</hi> with a ſmall charge to the
Crown, the Foot being maintained by the Boors, but
the Horſemen have for the moſt part ſome Farms in their
poſſeſſion belonging to the Crown, the Revenues of
which are their pay. But the King's Guards are paid
out of his Treaſury. Formerly the ſtation of the Royal
Navy was at <hi>Stockholm,</hi> but ſince a new Harbour has
been made in <hi>Bleckingen,</hi> where the Ships may be put
to Sea ſooner, and with more conveniency. Beſides this,
<hi>Sweden</hi> has this advantage, that it is covered on the ſide
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:65650:294"/>
of <hi>Norway</hi> with inacceſſible Rocks, beſides the three
ſtrong Fortreſſes of <hi>Bahus, Marſtrand</hi> and <hi>Gothenburgh,</hi>
and the <hi>Swediſh</hi> and <hi>Finland</hi> Coaſts are ſo well guarded
by innumerable Iſlands, that it is very difficult to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
the ſhoar.</p>
               <p>§ 20.<note place="margin">Neighbours of <hi>Sweden.</hi>
                  </note> As to the Neighbours of <hi>Sweden,</hi> it borders on
the Eaſt ſide upon <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> with whom the <hi>Swedes</hi> in
former times were often at War,<note place="margin">Muſcovites.</note> but ſince <hi>Finland</hi> is
now well covered againſt them by the Fortreſſes of
<hi>Narva, Kexholm</hi> and <hi>Noteburgh,</hi> and they have learn'd
by experience that the <hi>Swedes</hi> are better Souldiers than
they, there is nothing to be feared from thence. And
ſince the <hi>Swedes</hi> have no great reaſon to covet any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Conqueſts on that ſide, they may be taken now for
good Neighbours.<note place="margin">Poles.</note> With the <hi>Poles</hi> the <hi>Swedes</hi> uſed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
to have no difference at all, except when in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
that Nation eſpouſed the quarrel of their King con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
his Title to <hi>Sweden.</hi> But ſince <hi>Charles Guſtave</hi>
a little humbled their pretenſions upon <hi>Livonia,</hi> as the
<hi>Swedes</hi> have done upon <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> the <hi>Poles</hi> for the future
may in all likelihood prove good Neighbours to <hi>Sweden.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Germany.</note>
The <hi>Swedes</hi> have had antiently a great Communication
with the <hi>Germans,</hi> by reaſon of their Commerce with
the <hi>Hanſe</hi> Towns. But ſince the <hi>Swedes</hi> have by the
<hi>Weſtphalia</hi> Treaty been put into poſſeſſion of two Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
in <hi>Germany,</hi> they enjoy the ſame right with the
reſt of the Eſtates, and the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> is now to be
conſidered as a Member, and not as a Neighbour of the
Empire, whoſe Intereſt therefore is to ſee, that the <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalia</hi>
Treaty be kept in vigour. There is ſome jealouſy
betwixt the <hi>Swedes</hi> and the Elector of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi>
about ſome part of <hi>Pomerania,</hi> which would elſe have
fallen to that Elector's ſhare, and beſides this, he is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to keep up a conſtant ſtanding Army againſt ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
a Neighbour, but ſince <hi>Sweden</hi> has preſerved
<hi>Brandenburgh</hi> and the reſt of the Proteſtant Eſtates, and
the ſaid Elector has received a triple equivalent for this
loſs, it is but reaſonable that ſomething of allowance
ſhould be given as to this point eſpecially, ſince it is not
for the Intereſt of <hi>Sweden</hi> to make any further Conqueſts
in <hi>Germany.</hi> But betwixt the <hi>Swedes</hi> and the Houſe of
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:65650:295"/>
                  <hi>Lunenburgh,</hi> there ought to be a good underſtanding, ſince
they are able to do one another great Service againſt
<hi>Denmark Brandenburgh</hi> and the <hi>Weſtphalian</hi> Biſhops.
Since <hi>Sweden</hi> by making the Sea the borders betwixt
them and <hi>Denmark,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Denmark.</note> has put a ſtop to theſe troubles
which formerly uſed to proceed from the too near neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood
of the <hi>Danes,</hi> and ſecured their Trade, it ought
not to make any attempt of further Conqueſts in <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi>
it being the Intereſt of moſt Eſtates of <hi>Europe,</hi> to
take care that neither of the two Northern Kings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
ſole Maſter of the Sound. Wherefore <hi>Sweden</hi>
ought to endeavour to keep the preſent limits betwixt
them and <hi>Denmark,</hi> and to live in amity with thoſe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates
in <hi>Germany,</hi> who are jealous of the Neighbourhood
of <hi>Denmark.</hi> The foundation of the good Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency,<note place="margin">France.</note>
betwixt <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Sweden</hi> was built upon the
common agreement of keeping under the overgrown
Greatneſs of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> but ſince the caſe is
now altened, the King of <hi>France</hi> now pretends to play
the Maſter over Princes. <hi>Sweden</hi> ought not to aſſiſt <hi>France</hi>
in thoſe Deſigns which overturn the <hi>Weſtphalian.</hi> Treaty,
or are intended againſt the Proteſtants in <hi>Germany</hi> and
<hi>Holland.</hi> The good underſtanding betwixt <hi>Sweden</hi> and
<hi>Holland</hi> is chiefly founded upon this bottom,<note place="margin">Holland.</note> that as
<hi>Sweden</hi> cannot be glad to ſee <hi>Holland</hi> ruined, ſo the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi>
are obliged to prevent the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> from
making himſelf ſole Maſter of the paſſage of the <hi>Sound</hi>
or the <hi>Baltick.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">England.</note> 
                  <hi>England</hi> has hitherto had ſo little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
with thoſe Northern parts, that their greateſt Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondency
has been tranſacted by way of contemplat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with very little Reality.<note place="margin">Spain <hi>and</hi> Portugal.</note> 
                  <hi>Spain</hi> is conſidered by the
<hi>Swedes</hi> as a part of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> tho' the <hi>Swedes</hi>
have ſo far a concern in the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands,</hi> as
from their preſervation depends the welfare of <hi>Holland.</hi>
But the good underſtanding betwixt <hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>Portugal</hi>
depends only from the mutual Commerce of theſe two
Nation, who elſe by reaſon of this great diſtance can
ſcarce be ſerviceable to one another.</p>
