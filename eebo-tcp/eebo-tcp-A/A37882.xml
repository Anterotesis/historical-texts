            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

SPEECH
At a

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entlemen, and you the Knights, Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens,
and Burgeſſes of the Houſe of
Commons, I am commanded by the
Lords to let you know that they have
taken ſerious deliberation of the propoſitions
made by you the other day in a conference con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the extremity in which the kingdome was
for want of money to give ſatisfaction to both ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:
I am commanded to let you know their
<pb facs="tcp:44157:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Lordſhips pleaſure in this or in any thing elſe that
may conduce for the ſervice of the King, and good
of the Kingdome, and will be very ready to give
ſuch aſſiſtance as you ſhall propound, or upon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
with them thinke fit to advance the worke.
You were pleaſed to declare the great induſtry u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
for raiſing of moneyes: and truly we conceive
it can ſcarce be paralleled in any time, where the
Houſe of Commons have ſhewed ſo great affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to the good of the Kingdome, as in their owne
particulars to bee ſo ingaged as they have beene.
But they now perceive, though as good ſecurity
as can be, and they conceive the cauſe of this hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance,
muſt be ſome apprehenſion of danger, for
which the Kingdome hath, and particularly the
City of London, the feare of unquiet and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
times, and ſo loath to part with money, for
we cannot conceive but there is mony in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and in the City. This feare is that which
maketh them all keepe the wealth they have to
ſerve their turnes in extremity of danger, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
think fit that ſince there is great uſe of money,
to open the credit of the Kingdome; for the gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of Subſidies muſt get credit, and peace and
tranquility will incourage the lending of money;
and therefore the Lords have commanded the
Lord Commiſſioners with all ſpeed to bring unto
you the bottome of the Treaty with the Scots, that
the Kingdome may ſee in what ſtate they are. And
then no doubt for theſe great ſummes the Lords
<pb facs="tcp:44157:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
will likewiſe concurre in that and all things elſe
that may conduce to the happineſſe of the State.</p>
            <p>And therefore becauſe wayes of money are
more proper to proceed from you then from us, if
you ſhall thinke fit that any way may be propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by you may be effectuall, or if you propound
not, their Lordſhips will let you know ſome of
their propoſitions. If you bee not now prepared
to conferre about it, we ſhall when you pleaſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
