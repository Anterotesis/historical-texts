            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The Iewes, whom the Apoſtle ſpake of in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Chapter, were afraid to come to this righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, leſt they ſhould be iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to the Law, and offend God, that had comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it ſo ſeriouſly to the Fathers.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle anſwereth, that this their feare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from ignorance of Gods righteouſneſſe, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:3995:4"/>
their owne Law: and addeth a reaſon in theſe words of my Text; For Chriſt is the end of the Law for righteouſneſſe to euery one that beleeueth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quicquid eſt veteris Teſtamenti, Chriſtum ſonat:</hi> All the Old Teſtament (as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaies) ſounds of Chriſt. The Ceremonies are nothing but figures of him: he is the kernell of the promiſe; they are all in him Yea and Amen; and without him no promiſe hath accompliſhment. He is the life and ſoule, and perfection and end of all the Commandements.</p>
            <p>And therefore hee that hath Chriſt, and holdeth him by faith, hath all that the Law requireth in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, offreth in promiſes, and ſhadoweth out in types and figures.</p>
            <p>The points in this text are conſiderable:</p>
            <p>
               <list>
                  <item>1 The prerogatiue that Chriſt hath aboue the Law: he is the end of the Law.</item>
                  <item>2 The benefit thereof: for righteouſneſſe.</item>
                  <item>3 To whom this benefit perteines: to euerie one that beleeueth.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Excellent things are ſpoken of the Law. If thou wilt enter into euerlaſting life (ſaith Chriſt vnto a Lawyer) keepe the Commandements. So ſaith <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Denter. 6</note> Behold, this ſhall be our righteouſneſſe before the Lord our God, If we take heed to all theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, to doe them.</p>
            <p>Whereby wee may perceiue, that faire and large promiſes are annexed to the Law. What is fairer than righteouſneſſe? What larger than euerlaſting life? But they are conditionall, and not abſolute: <hi>Si potes dicere, Feci quod iuſsiſti, potes itidem dicere, Redde quod promiſiſti:</hi> If thou canſt ſay, I haue done that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:3995:4"/>
which thou commandeſt, thou maiſt well ſay, Giue me that thou promiſeſt.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, if the Law be not obſerued, and that exquiſitely too, the threats thereof are all as ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible. Curſed is euery one that abideth not in all that is written in the Law, to doe them.</p>
            <p>Hard conditions, of doing, and doing all.</p>
            <p>And if you pleaſe that wee ſhall enter into the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, whether wee can performe the Law, or not; <hi>Paul</hi> anſwereth, that it is a matter not of difficulties;<note place="margin">Rom. 8,</note> for that might be compaſſed with endeuour, but of impoſſibilitie; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; that which was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for the Law to doe. And hee giueth a reaſon thereof in the former chapter: The Law is ſpirituall, and I am carnall. Now theſe two be contraries. For the fleſh euermore luſteth againſt the ſpirit:<note place="margin">Galat.</note> witneſſe the ſame Apoſtle, not in words onely, but in true ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience alſo. For hee felt a Law in his members re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belling againſt the Law of God, and leading him captiue. When this elect Veſſell, and great Apoſtle, after he was regenerate (for the vnregenerate feele no ſuch ſtrife) found this long diſtance betweene the Law and his owne affections; and ſuch defects, that for horrour thereof he cried our, O miſerable man that I am! may wee attend any good performance or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement of the Law in others?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Steuen</hi> challengeth the whole Nation of the Iewes;<note place="margin">Act. 7.</note> You haue receiued the Law, and haue not kept it. His words carry the ſtrength and ſinewes of an argument. That which is not kept, cannot iuſtifie: But you haue not kept the Law: therefore what boaſt ſoeuer you doe make thereof, that you receiued it from GOD,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:3995:5"/>
that it was publiſhed by Angels, and giuen to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, yet doth it not iuſtifie; it giues you no prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue. They could not anſwer this with reaſon, and therefore fell into paſſion and outrage: the text ſaith, When they heard theſe things, their hearts burſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder, and they gnaſhed vpon him with their teeth: Manifeſt euidence of conuiction.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Act. 15.</note>
               <hi>Peter</hi> calleth the keeping of the Law, an importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble yoke, and conteſteth againſt thoſe which vrged the performance thereof for iuſtification, that they laid a taske vpon the necks of their brethren, which neither they nor their fathers were able to beare.</p>
            <p>If the Law could be performed, why doth <hi>Peter</hi> call it an importable yoke? If it cannot bee performed, why is righteouſneſſe ſought or placed in it? For it is not the hearing or hauing, but the doing of the Law, that iuſtifieth.</p>
            <p>Sinne (as <hi>Iohn</hi> defineth it) is a tranſgreſſion of the Law: And doe not all men ſinne? It were a ſinne for any man to ſay, he hath no ſinne: and if we confeſſe our ſinnes, what do we confeſſe, but that we are tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors, and not performers of the Law?</p>
            <p>Shall we put the matter to a triall, and let all the ſaints in heauen and earth paſſe vpon the Iurie?</p>
            <p>O Lord, let them bee demanded heere in thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, if it were by their workes, or fulfilling of the Law, that they were iuſtified. Haue they not all with one voice returned their verdict? Not vnto vs, O Lord, not vnto vs, but vnto thy name giue the praiſe, for thy louing mercy, and for thy truths ſake.</p>
            <p>Where is <hi>Iames,</hi> or <hi>Iohn,</hi> or one of the ſonnes of thunder, to ſet foorth the dreadfulneſſe of the Law?
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:3995:5"/>
For I am ſcarſe able to giue you a taſte thereof; but by a little you can conceiue the reſt. Looke then to the concuſſion of the Iſraelites, 19. and 20. chap. of Exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus, when the Law was eſtabliſhed, they came with great endeuour, in faſting, ſanctifying, and preparing themſelues: yet when they beheld with what maieſty and terrour it was publiſhed, how the mountaine ſmoaked, the thunders roared, the lightnings flaſhed, the trumpets ſounded, and the earth trembled; they cried out, We ſhall die, we ſhall die. And this was no vaine feare, but a true ſenſible feeling of the rigor and ſeueritie of the Law.</p>
            <p>Come then yee Iuſticiaries, that are ſo fooliſhlie zealous of the Law: Compare your ſelues, not with your ſelues (for that may proue to be a falſe meaſure) but compare your ſelues with theſe Iſraelites; and that is no diſparagement.</p>
            <p>They were afraid of the Law, when it was publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and how dare you preſume, when it is exacted? They could not endure the proclamation of the Law; And will you abide the execution? Vpon what confidence? Are your workes anſwerable to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite triall thereof? Alas, alas, I will not abaſe them with ſuch termes as the Scripture would affoord: But make them as glorious as you can; couer them with grace; deriue them from the holy Ghoſt; dip them and die them in the blood of Chriſt; apparrell them with all the iewels, attire, and habil<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ments, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath beſtowed vpon them: yet you ſhall finde them but hay, chaffe, and ſtubble, that will bee deuoured in the firie triall of the Law: you ſhall finde them but humane righteouſneſſe: you ſhal
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:3995:6"/>
haue no more vſe of them in the buſineſſe of iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than <hi>Dauid</hi> had of <hi>Sauls</hi> armour, when he went to encounter with <hi>Goliah.</hi> It made a ſhew to others, but hindred <hi>Dauid,</hi> that he could not goe with it.</p>
            <p>Such poore helpes, and no better, haue all they that eſtabliſh their owne righteouſneſſe, and are not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the righteouſneſſe of God.</p>
            <p>I can reſemble the Law to nothing better, than to the man in the Goſpell, that would be brought to no other ſong, than to thoſe ſad and vnwelcome tunes of <hi>Solue quod debes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh Lord, who can abide the harſhneſſe of thoſe ſharpe notes! Who ſhall euer bee able to ſatisfie the rigorous exactions of ſuch an vnmercifull Creditor! When the Law ſhall require the vttermoſt farthing moſt imperiouſly, and we not able to anſwer one for a thouſand tolerably: you can eaſily conceiue, what heauy ſentence, what loathſome priſon, what tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call paines, what weeping and wailing, what gnaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of teeth, what vnquenchable fire, what euer-gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and neuer-dying worme, muſt follow neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily.</p>
            <p>What then? Is the Law idle? or is God altogether rigorous, that propoſeth a Law which cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed? Neither of both.</p>
            <p>God made a Law like vnto himſelfe: holy, becauſe he is holy; pure, becauſe he is pure; perfect, becauſe he is perfect; eternall, becauſe he is eternall: and added that condition alſo which a great Law-giuer requireth in all Lawes: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: Hee made it poſſible, for that integritie of nature wherein God created vs. For God made man right.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:3995:6"/>If that poſſibilitie bee now taken away from the Law; if our nature be wounded; if it be diſabled; if our fathers haue eaten ſowre grapes, and all our teeth bee ſet on edge; if wee haue loſt that integritie that GOD gaue vnto vs; let him be free: for he is light, and in him dwelleth no darkneſſe: let vs not charge him fooliſhly, but condemne our owne preuarication iuſtly.</p>
            <p>For ſo it was, as if a man ſhould leaue a great ſumme of money to one whoſe eſtate was then good, and ſufficient to make reſtitution: if afterward, through prodigalitie, riot, or vnthriftineſſe, he miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpent or waſted his eſtate, and left himſelfe no meanes of repaiment, can either the accuſation of the credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors crueltie, that demands nothing but his owne, or the excuſe of the debtors inabilities, be iuſt? Euen ſo the Law was propoſed to man, created after the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and ſimilitude of God, with perfect righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and true holineſſe, and indowments, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the ſame.</p>
            <p>If afterward wee haue miſ-ſpent our patrimonie, and waſted our fathers ſubſtance, with the prodigall ſonne; if we haue caſt our ſelues into the hands of theeues and cut-throats, that haue bereaued vs of all meanes to giue ſatisfaction; wee may deplore our owne infelicitie; wee cannot except againſt God, or his Law, Was it not poſſible?</p>
            <p>Grant this, and then you diſcharge God from all imputation: denie it, and then you infringe, abate, and detract from <hi>Adams</hi> perfection, which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture celebrateth.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee, that the Law was poſſible: but it is

And is it poſſible that we ſhould flie to the marke of righteouſneſſe, or to the end of the Law, when our feathers are thus glude together with bird<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime?</p>
            <p>Ah proud and wayward fleſh! Why doeſt thou ſpurne, and luſt, and murmur againſt the Law? If it humble thee for a time, is it not becauſe it would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance thee for euer?</p>

            <p>But the belly hath no eares; and in vaine doe wee heere looke for that which is due elſewhere, and in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother place: heere wee doe fight, wee doe not tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph.

            <p>Put off the old man, and put on the new: waſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all birdlime of concupiſcence: crucifie your earthly members: tame the fleſh, &amp; bring it into true ſubiection; that the law may ſay, goe, and it goeth; come, and it commeth; doe this, and it doth ſo: then you ſhall finde no defect in the law.</p>
            <p>O that all weakneſſe were ſo taken away from this ſinfull fleſh of mine! O that all the ſores thereof were in this ſort healed! Should not I then run the way of the Commandements?</p>
            <p>But this the law cannot doe: it rather diſcouereth them, and aggrauateth their ſinne, and makes it out of meaſure ſinfull: not vnprofitable; for if the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe were light, it would be contemned: then reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy would not be ſought, and ſo no cure. <hi>Lex data est, vt gratia quaereretur: gratia data eſt, vt lex impleretur.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:3995:8"/>I remember the ſtory of <hi>Elizeus</hi> in the booke of the Kings. He was a Prophet, and prophecied, as well by his deeds, as in his words. The Shunamites ſon was dead; it was told the Prophet; he ſent his ſtaffe by his ſeruant; Goe lay it vpon the childes face; but the dead receiued no life. The Prophet knew what hee did, that the ſtaffe would not be ſufficient, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore came himſelfe.</p>
            <p>The law is like to <hi>Elizeus</hi> ſtaffe: though it were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and <hi>Elizeus</hi> ſent it to giue life, yet did it not giue life. For if there had beene a law that could giue life, then righteouſneſſe ſhould haue come by the law. Now wee are all like to the Shunamites childe, dead in ſinne. Come then <hi>Elizeus,</hi> and raiſe the dead: ſend not thy ſtaffe by any ſeruant: but come thy ſelfe. Come, come, O pittifull and ſweet Samaritane, heale this poore hurt creature; powre in wine and oile. The Prieſt ſaw it, and paſſed by: the Leuite looked vpon it, but no offices of the law had compaſſion. Come therefore, come courteous Samaritane; for there is mercy with thee. Binde vp my ſores, ſet mee vpon thine owne beaſt: but leaue me not with any Hoſt or In-keeper. For whom haue I in heauen but thee? and there is none on earth that I deſire, in compariſon of thee. <hi>Numquid poſſunt ſanare languores meos?</hi> Therfore take charge of me thy ſelfe. Say vnto me (o thou pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruer of mankinde) ſay vnto my ſoule, I am thy ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but ſay it ſo that I may heare. Open mee the gates of righteouſneſſe, and I will enter therein,</p>
            <p>That which the law could not doe, becauſe it was made weake through our fleſh, God ſent his ſonne to doe. He ſent Chriſt to be the end of the law. He ſent
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:3995:8"/>
no ſeruant about it. <hi>Moſes</hi> indeed was faithfull in all his houſe, but his tongue was heauy, and not eloquent enough to treat of ſuch a cauſe. <hi>Eſaies</hi> lips were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane; <hi>Ieremie</hi> was a childe, and could not ſpeake; all the Prophets were tongue-tied; and the Angels themſelues were vnable to entertaine the matter for vs. When Angels were fallen, could Angels mediate their owne reſtitution?</p>
            <p>Then can they neuer bee competent for vs, that were inſufficient for themſelues.</p>
            <p>To be vmpeere betweene God and man, to make appointment and tranſaction of their differences, to ſuſtaine the wrath of the one, and the miſeries of the other (and that a mediatour muſt doe) is certainlie beyond the capacitie and compaſſe of euery creature.</p>
            <p>Verily none but God can plead with God: the ſon with the father: God mercifull, with God iuſt: God pleaſed, with God offended.</p>
            <p>May I craue your honourable leaue and patience, to informe you of a ſharpe contention? and it ſhall not bee impertinent to this buſineſſe that I treat of. Truth and righteouſnes contend for the puniſhment of mankinde with peace and mercy, pleading for his deliuerance.</p>
            <p>Whole <hi>Adam</hi> (ſaith Iuſtice) muſt die, becauſe whole <hi>Adam</hi> hath offended. And if regard be not had of my ſiſter truth and my ſelfe, yet may not the word be infringed that is gone out of the mouth of God, In what day ſoeuer thou ſhalt eat of this fruit, thou ſhalt die the death.</p>
            <p>Mercy maketh anſwer, that if the matter ſhould go ſo, and no commiſeration taken, but that whole man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:3995:9"/>
muſt be condemned, then why were Peace and I brought into the world to bee cut away ſo ſoone againe?</p>
            <p>Reply was made by Truth, that Mercy had zeale in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but not according to knowledge. For in pittie towards mankinde, ſhee is cruell to Iuſtice and mee that are her ſiſters; deſiring to haue him ſpared, and vs aboliſhed. For it is not poſſible for vs to conſiſt without this puniſhment.</p>
            <p>The controuerſie is difficult, and happily ſome doe wiſh for <hi>Salomon</hi> to decide it. But a greater than <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> was there; yet that could not hold them from bitterneſſe, till Peace had reprooued both ſides, and told them, that contention was vnbeſeeming vertues and ſiſters. All this while the Iudge was ſtooping downe, and writing vpon the ground. The tenour of his writing was this, as Peace did read it:</p>
            <p>The one ſide ſayes, that all mankinde muſt die, or elſe Righteouſneſſe and Truth cannot liue: The other ſide ſayes, that in caſe mankind die, Mercy and Peace muſt periſh with them.</p>
            <p>This is my ſentence: <hi>Fiat mors bona, &amp; habet vtra<expan>
                     <am>

                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> pars quod petebat.</hi> All wondered at the wiſdome and integritie of the deciſion. But the remedie was as hard as the diſeaſe. That death ſhould bee made good, it was impoſſible, vnleſſe ſuch a one ſhould vndertake the buſineſſe, that was not indebted to death. And where ſhould he be found? Verily none can giue aid, but he that gaue counſell. And ſo they had recourſe vnto the ſonne of God, who turning to his father, ſaid, Sacrifice and burnt-offering thou wouldeſt not haue, but haſt fitted mee vp a body for this death. In
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:3995:9"/>
the volume of thy booke it is written of mee, that I ſhould fulfill thy will. O my God, I am content to do it. So he put his owne deciſion in practiſe. Then Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Truth met together; Righteouſneſſe and Peace kiſſed each other. Hee was that ladder that <hi>Iacob</hi> did ſee joining heauen and earth together. Where the law ended in curſing and imprecation, becauſe it was not obſerued, there Chriſt began, and redeemed vs from the curſe of the law, and was made a curſe for vs.</p>
            <p>He did heerein as in the matter of Tribute, when it was demanded; although he were free as the ſonne of a King, yet becauſe wee will leaue none offenſe, Goe <hi>Peter,</hi> take this peece of twenty pence, and pay for me and thee. <hi>O bone Domine Ieſu,</hi> O good Lord Ieſus, wilt thou indeed pay for thee and me? for that which thou ſaideſt vnto <hi>Peter,</hi> thou ſayeſt vnto euery one of thy Church: take it, and pay it for thee and me.</p>

               </gap>e the paiment is ſoone made, becauſe thou waſt born, free. But my ſinne is great; and is not my redemption plenteous? I haue tranſgreſſed the whole law; and haue not I fulfilled it too a little? But the reward of ſinne is death; and is there any gall of bitterneſſe in that cup whereof I haue not taſted? Wherefore was all this done? Was it for my ſelfe? I will not bee a witneſſe in mine owne cauſe. Aske mine enemies that were chiefe actors in the buſineſſe. They will not be partiall. Did not <hi>Pilate</hi> pronounce from his tribunall, that hee found no cauſe of death in me? Was not this a part of <hi>Caiaphas</hi> cenſure, that it was expedient that I ſhould die for the people?</p>
            <p>Take him then, good Chriſtian brother, and pay for thee and me. Hee is the firſt fiſh that commeth
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:3995:10"/>
from the ſea of death. Verily, the firſt begotten a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the dead. Open his life and death, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer puniſhment yee finde in the one, or righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe in the other, take it all, and pay it for thee and me.</p>
            <p>What, both death and life? Is not the one of them ſufficient? There is a rule, that the law doth binde ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to obedience, or to puniſhment. So if the one of the diſiunctiues, or the other, be performed, the law is ſatisfied, and come to her end.</p>
            <p>This rule hath place in humane lawes amongſt light offenſes. There, if the law cannot haue obedience, it hath ſome ſatisfaction by puniſhment: but then it writes, Contented, and not Pleaſed. For the chiefe end whereunto all lawes doe aime, is to haue obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and thereby to make men good, which cannot bee done in humane lawes, when the offenſe is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and the puniſhment capitall.</p>
            <p>In the law of God, eſpecially concerning the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Iuſtification, the rule of diſiunctiues hath no place. This law hath not her end, vnleſſe ſhe be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented and pleaſed too. Contented, for the ſins that we haue committed; and pleaſed, with the obedience that is required. Chriſt is the end of the law: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hath performed both.</p>
            <p>Well might the law be contented with the death of Chriſt, becauſe there was as much atrocitie in that, as in the ſinnes of the whole world. I willingly vſe this reaſon now, to giue you to vnderſtand, that I concurre not with their opinion, that thinke, if the ſonne of God had ſhed but one drop of blood, it had beene price enough for all our ſinnes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:3995:10"/>I doubt whether the law would haue beene conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with one drop of blood. Ought not Chriſt to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer all theſe things, and ſo to enter into glory? Was not the whole burnt offring a figure of his ſufferings? And that muſt be all conſumed.</p>
            <p>I looke into the counſell of God, what was there ſet downe for ſatisfaction of the law. And I carrie and giue ſuch reuerence to the wiſdome and iuſtice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that whatſoeuer is wanting of that which is there ſet downe, I verily beleeue to be inſufficient.</p>
            <p>I looke to the fact of Chriſt. <hi>Exinaniuit ſeipſum:</hi> He emptied himſelfe. And I am loth to beleeue, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the father was ſo prodigall of his ſonnes life, or that the ſonne was ſo careleſſe of his owne blood, that he would haue powred out all, if one drop might haue ſerued the turne. Admit this, and then Chriſt died in vaine.</p>
            <p>But euery thing that the ſonne of God did, was of infinite value, for the dignitie of his perſon.</p>
            <p>The dignitie of his perſon is great, and hath good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vſe: but it may not be ſtretched too farre, leſt the buffets that he receiued on his face be reckoned price enough for our redemption. <hi>Hydra peccati vno icta non tollitur:</hi> Then monſter of ſinne will not be ſlaine with one blow.</p>
            <p>Hee made vs indeed at a moment, and with great facilitie: for he ſpake the word, and they were made; he commanded, and they were created. But did hee redeeme vs ſo ſoone? No, no; it coſt him three and thirtie yeeres worke, and O Lord, what labours! What ſorrowes! What watchings! What hunger! What thirſt! What temptations! What praiers!
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:3995:11"/>
What ſtrong cries! What groanes! What indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties! What ſcourgings! What agonies! And after all theſe, what a bitter death! I dare bee bold to ſay, that there was as much atrocitie in all theſe, as in the ſinnes of the whole world. And therefore the law might well be contented, for matter of puniſhment, with the death of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dubitas quod dabit tibi bona ſua, qui non dedignatus est ſuſciperemala tua?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Adde then heereunto his perpetuall obedience to the law of God, neuer intermitted in the whole tenor of his life: and then Chriſt is the end and perfection of the law: hee hath contented it, and pleaſed it too.</p>
            <p>Hee died indeed vpon the Croſſe, and in my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and for my ſinnes of humane infirmitie But he brought withall ſuch a troupe and legion of vertues to his Croſſe, as might well giue righteouſneſſe to the whole world.</p>
            <p>Time will not ſerue to rehearſe euery one: but the vertues wherewith he adorned the foure corners of his croſſe are ſo conſpicuous, that I cannot omit them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Supereminentior eſt charitas:</hi> Loue takes the higheſt place, and is ſet on the top of his croſſe. <hi>Maiorem charitatem nemo habet:</hi> None can haue greater loue, than to lay downe his life for his friends: None verily but he himſelfe, that laid it downe for his enemies.</p>
            <p>On the right hand of the croſſe hee ſet obedience, whereof hee was ſo reſpectiue, that hee did chuſe to loſe his life rather than his obedience. And if obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence were better than ſacrifice, when the chiefe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God was in ſacrifice, as <hi>Samuel</hi> telleth <hi>Saul,</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:3995:11"/>
and yet that obedience was commanded, &amp; humane obedience; how pleaſing was the diuine obedience of the ſonne of God, that was neuer commanded, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies voluntary, alwaies <hi>indebita?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Patience ſtandeth at the left ſide: As a ſheepe led to the ſlaughter, ſo opened he not his mouth: he ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it not in outcries or imprecations; he contended not with them in reuenge or malice, but in pietie: they refuſed him, and he died for them: they conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with <hi>Pilate,</hi> when hee would haue deliuered him, <hi>Crucifige, crucifige,</hi> Crucifie him, crucifie him: and he contendeth with his father when hee had iuſt cauſe to deſtroy them, <hi>Pater ignoſce, pater ignoſce:</hi> Father for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue them, father forgiue them. Hee regarded more that he died for them, than that he died by them.</p>
            <p>In the bottome of his Croſſe hee placed humilitie, the foundation of all vertues, that if we will not learn to be humble in the ſchooles of men, wee may now practiſe it by the precedent and patterne of an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble God. <hi>His quatuor v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

to giue vs faith to comprehend him. And therefore when he giueth vs the condition which he requireth of vs, his condition is moſt gracious, and the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Law is grieuous. Chriſt is the end of the law for righteouſneſſe to euery one that beleeueth.</p>
            <p>If Chriſt bee the end of the law to euery one that beleeueth, then did he not fulfill the law for himſelfe, but for thoſe that doe beleeue.</p>

            <p>This will eaſily be yeelded, that hee ſuffred for vs; but the other point is controuerted, that hee fulfilled the law for himſelfe, and for his owne righteouſneſſe.</p>

            <p>If Lord of the law, as man, then needed hee not to be ſubiect: but hee made himſelfe. So the Apoſtle writeth to the Galathians: but he addeth the reaſon of Chriſt his ſubiection; that hee might redeeme vs that were vnder the law.</p>
            <p>When the humane nature in the very moment of

            <p>The law verily was enioined to euery humane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; but <hi>Deus verbum</hi> (as <hi>Augustine</hi> ſayes) <hi>non ſuſcepit perſonam, ſed naturam hominis:</hi> and this nature hauing no ſubſiſtance at any time of it ſelfe, but aſſoone as it began to bee, it was perſonated, as they ſay in the ſchooles of the diuinitie, could not bee brought into neceſſarie ſubiection of the law, without manifeſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie to that perſon that ſuſteineth it.</p>

            <p>In the meane time wee will ſearch (if you pleaſe) what allowance the Scripture giueth to fire for pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of ſinnes.

            <p>The true Purgatorie of Chriſtians is the blood of Ieſus Chriſt, which quencheth euery aduerſary fire, and purgeth vs from all our ſinnes. When the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion pierced his ſide, there came out water and blood, to ſhew that it was no common and ordinary blood that came from Ieſus Chriſt, but ſuch as had a cleanſing vertue. O Lord purge vs heerewith, and wee ſhall be cleane: waſh our robes in the blood of this Lambe, and we ſhall be whiter than ſnow. Surely he that is ſo waſhed already, needs not the mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall fire of Purgatorie, but is cleane thorowout. And he that is not waſhed with the blood of Chriſt, ſhall neuer be cleanſed, but tormented for euer in real fire.

            <p>It cannot be for that the worke of Chriſts redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was not performed at the time of their death: For albeit, that worke was fixed to the fulnes of time: Before, his houre was not come: Then, hee would

not admit of any tergiuerſation. Shall I not drinke of the cup which my father hath giuen me?
