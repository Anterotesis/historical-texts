            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>HOW wretched is the Fate of those who write!</l>
            <l>Brought muzled to the Stage, for fear they bite.</l>
            <l>Where, like <hi>Tom Dove,</hi> they stand the Common Foe;</l>
            <l>Lugg'd by the <hi>Critique,</hi> Baited by the <hi>Beau.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Yet worse, their Brother <hi>Poets</hi> Damn the Play,</l>
            <l>And Roar the loudest, tho' they never Pay.</l>
            <l>The Fops are proud of Scandal, for they cry,</l>
            <l>At every lewd, low Character, —That's I.</l>
            <l>He who writes Letters to himself, wou'd Swear</l>
            <l>The World forgot him, if he was not there.</l>
            <l>What shou'd a Poet do? 'Tis hard for One</l>
            <l>To pleasure all the Fools that wou'd be shown:</l>
            <l>And yet not Two in Ten will pass the Town.</l>
            <l>Most Coxcombs are not of the Laughing kind;</l>
            <l>More goes to make a Fop, than Fops can find.</l>
            <l>Quack <hi>Marus,</hi> tho' he never took Degrees</l>
            <l>In either of our Vniversities;</l>
            <l>Yet to be shown by some kind Wit he looks,</l>
            <l>Because he plaid the fool and writ Three Books.</l>
            <l>But if he wou'd be worth a Poet's Pen,</l>
            <l>He must be more a Fool, and write again:</l>
            <l>For all the former Fustian stuff he wrote,</l>
            <l>Was Dead-born Doggrel, or is quite forgot;</l>
            <l>His Man of <hi>Uz,</hi> stript of his <hi>Hebrew</hi> Robe,</l>
            <l>Is just the Proverb, and <hi>As poor as</hi> Iob.</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:46368:4"/>One wou'd have thought he cou'd no longer Iog;</l>
            <l>But <hi>Arthur</hi> was a Level, <hi>Job</hi>'s a Bog.</l>
            <l>There, tho' he crept, yet still he kept in sight;</l>
            <l>But here, he founders in, and sinks down right.</l>
            <l>Had he prepar'd us, and been dull by Rule,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Tobit</hi> had first been turn'd to Ridicule:</l>
            <l>But our bold <hi>Britton,</hi> without Fear or Awe,</l>
            <l>O're-leaps at once, the whole <hi>Apocrypha;</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Invades the <hi>Psalms</hi> with Rhymes, and leaves no room</l>
            <l>For any Vandal <hi>Hopkins</hi> yet to come.</l>
            <l>But what if, after all, this Godly Geer,</l>
            <l>Is not so Senceless as it wou'd appear?</l>
            <l>Our Mountebank has laid a deeper Train,</l>
            <l>His Cant, like <hi>Merry Andrew</hi>'s Noble Vein,</l>
            <l>Cat-Call's the Sects, to draw 'em in again.</l>
            <l>At leisure Hours, in Epique Song he deals,</l>
            <l>Writes to the rumbling of his Coaches Wheels,</l>
            <l>Prescribes in hast, and seldom kills by Rule,</l>
            <l>But rides Triumphant between Stool and Stool.</l>
            <l>Well, let him go; 'tis yet too early day,</l>
            <l>To get himself a Place in Farce or Play.</l>
            <l>We know not by what Name we should Arraign him,</l>
            <l>For no one Category can contain him;</l>
            <l>A Pedant, Canting Preacher, and a Quack,</l>
            <l>Are Load enough to break one Asses Back:</l>
            <l>At last, grown wanton, he presum'd to write,</l>
            <l>Traduc'd Two Kings, their kindness to requite;</l>
            <l>One made the Doctor, and one dubb'd the Knight.</l>

            <head>EPILOGUE. By Mr. <hi>Dryden.</hi>
            </head>
            <l>PErhaps the Parson stretch'd a point too far,</l>
            <l>When with our <hi>Theatres</hi> he wag'd a War.</l>
            <l>He tells you, That this very Moral Age</l>
            <l>Receiv'd the first Infection from the Stage.</l>
            <l>But sure, a banisht Court, with Lewdness fraught,</l>
            <l>The Seeds of open Vice returning brought.</l>
            <l>Thus Lodg'd, (as Vice by great Example thrives)</l>
            <l>It first debauch'd the Daughters and the Wives.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>London,</hi> a fruitful Soil, yet never bore</l>
            <l>So plentiful a Crop of Horns before.</l>
            <l>The <hi>Poets,</hi> who must live by Courts or starve,</l>
            <l>Were proud, so good a Government to serve;</l>
            <l>And mixing with Buffoons and Pimps profain,</l>
            <l>Tainted the Stage, for some small Snip of Gain.</l>
            <l>For they, like <hi>Harlots</hi> under <hi>Bawds</hi> profest,</l>
            <l>Took all th' ungodly pains, and got the least.</l>
            <l>Thus did the thriving Malady prevail,</l>
            <l>The Court, it's Head, the <hi>Poets</hi> but the Tail.</l>
            <l>The Sin was of our Native growth, 'tis true;</l>
            <l>The Scandall of the Sin was wholly new.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Misses</hi> there were, but modestly conceal'd;</l>
            <l>
               <hi>White-hall</hi> the naked <hi>Venus</hi> first reveal'd.</l>
            <l>Who standing, as at <hi>Cyprus,</hi> in her Shrine,</l>
            <l>The Strumpet was ador'd with Rites Divine.</l>
            <l>E're this, if Saints had any Secret Motion,</l>
            <l>'Twas Chamber Practice all, and Close Devotion.</l>
            <l>I pass the Peccadillo's of their time;</l>
            <l>Nothing but open Lewdness was a Crime.</l>
            <l>A <hi>Monarch</hi>'s Blood was venial to the Nation,</l>
            <l>Compar'd with one foul Act of Fornication.</l>
            <l>Now, they wou'd Silence us, and shut the Door</l>
            <l>That let in all the barefac'd Vice before.</l>
            <l>As for reforming us, which some pretend,</l>
            <l>That work in <hi>England</hi> is without an end;</l>
            <l>Well we may change, but we shall never mend.</l>
            <l>Yet, if you can but bear the present Stage,</l>
            <l>We hope much better of the coming Age.</l>
            <l>What wou'd you say, if we shou'd first begin</l>
            <l>To Stop the Trade of Love, behind the Scene:</l>
            <l>Where <hi>Actresses</hi> make bold with maried Men?</l>
            <l>For while abroad so prodigal the <hi>Dolt</hi> is,</l>
            <l>Poor Spouse at home as ragged as a Colt is.</l>
            <l>In short, we'll grow as Moral as we can,</l>
            <l>Save here and there a Woman or a Man:</l>
            <l>But neither you, nor we, with all our pains,</l>
            <l>Can make clean work; there will be some Remains,</l>
            <l>While you have still your <hi>Oats,</hi> and we our <hi>Hains.</hi>

Soldiers, appear, and bring a halter with ye. I'll forgive your Holy Habit, Sir, but I'll hang you.</p>
