            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Present you here (as most resembling them) the <hi>Sports</hi> and <hi>Recreations</hi> of these great <hi>Ladies,</hi> who have so sublimed them by a <hi>Divine quality</hi> they have to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert all into <hi>Vertue,</hi> as <hi>Midas</hi> did all he touched to <hi>Gold;</hi> whence their very <hi>Sports</hi> are as <hi>vertuous</hi> as others <hi>devotions:</hi> Those <hi>melancholly Spirits</hi> then enemies of all <hi>chearfulness,</hi> who call such Sports as these, but <hi>idle things,</hi> seem wholly ignorant of their first <hi>institution,</hi> and very <hi>signification</hi> of their names. For wherefore were they called <hi>Relaxations, Divertisements,</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations,</hi> but for relaxing our over bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>thoughts,</hi> diverting our <hi>minds</hi> from <hi>cares</hi> and <hi>troubles</hi> of this life, and <hi>recreating</hi> our <hi>Spirits</hi> when tired and spent with World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly businesses. Whence to conclude, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever in this <hi>mortal life</hi> can live without

them, must either be a <hi>God,</hi> or else a <hi>Beast,</hi> above, or else below <hi>Humanity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And so much for their <hi>Sports;</hi> as for the <hi>Ladies</hi> themselves, I suppose they are so well known to all, as I need, in this <hi>Epistle,</hi> to say no more of them; but that they had always a high esteem for our <hi>English Ladies;</hi> and therefore, I doubt not, but you will have the like of them. Be pleased then <hi>Ladies,</hi> for their sakes, to accept a <hi>Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> of this short <hi>Treatise,</hi> from him who is naturally an enemy of all that is long and tedious, a friend to these <hi>Sports</hi> and <hi>Recreations,</hi> an honorer and admirer of all your <hi>Nobler Sex,</hi> especially of all <hi>Fair</hi> and <hi>Vertuous Ladies</hi> like your selves.</p>

               <p>THe next Nights sport, and that of many Nights after, was the Acting of <hi>Proverbs,</hi> a sport of so great variety, as you might often repeat it, and never twice the same again; where note, That as there are divers sorts of other sports, some which cause laughter without any <hi>Wit,</hi> others more studious then delightful as <hi>Ridles, Rebus's,</hi> and <hi>Anagrams;</hi> or half witted <hi>Paradoxes,</hi> as, <hi>A Chandler can least hide his own knavery, for all his works must come to light.</hi> And, <hi>a Shoomaker would make the best Constable, for he can put any Man in the Stocks, and take him out at last.</hi> So there are divers sorts of this, some acting <hi>Proverbs</hi> in Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing; others in dumb shew and mimick gesture, and the like; which may be <hi>sports,</hi> but not <hi>sports</hi> of Wit, or but dumb wit at most; whereas, that of these <hi>Ladies,</hi> added words unto action: Of which, we shall give you an example or two, not doubting, but if the <hi>Ladies</hi> be delighted with it, there are wits enough to furnish them with more.</p>

                  <head>PROV. It is merry when Friends meet.</head>
                  <p>THe <hi>Scene</hi> was supposed an <hi>Inn</hi> where divers Friends met, as by chance, and recounted their several adventures on the way; some more dangerous, others more pleasant; every one making a several <hi>Novella,</hi> and all together a delightful <hi>Variety.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the rest two persons arrived so disguised, that they seemed strangers both to themselves and all the rest, who recounting their adventures, were soon known to be a pair of Noble <hi>Lovers,</hi> who on the eve of their Nuptials, were severally made <hi>Captives</hi> by strange adventures; and by as strange, delivered from <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity</hi> again, to their incredible <hi>joy,</hi> and little less of all the Company, as they declared by their <hi>Congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulations, Embracements;</hi> and all the signs of <hi>joy</hi> and <hi>gladness,</hi> which are usually shewn on such occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</p>

                  <head>PROV. No true Pleasure in this World.</head>
                  <p>TO confirm this, they took for Argument that <hi>Moral Fable,</hi> how <hi>Jupiter,</hi> in the first Creation, sent <hi>Pleasure</hi> down from Heaven, for the consolation of poor Mortals here on Earth; of whom, they soon became so great Idolaters, that they offered more Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to it, then to all the Gods besides. At which, the Gods offended, recalled <hi>Pleasure</hi> back to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven again, who ascending, threw off its Earthly Garment; which <hi>Dolon</hi> or <hi>Deceit</hi> finding, put on, and ever since hath passed for it; Men foolishly ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring as much the shadow of <hi>Pleasure</hi> now, as they did the substance of it before. When <hi>Jove,</hi> pittying they should be so deceived, sent <hi>Mercury</hi> down to unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, and discover the <hi>Imposture</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit.</hi> But soon he found his Embassie was in vain, and that all his eloquence was lost upon them, who would not believe, though a God did tell them so, That there was any other <hi>Pleasure,</hi> but what they had. When <hi>Jove</hi> seeing he must create the World and Men anew, to make them better and wiser, resolved for their punishment, to leave them to the pleasure of <hi>Beasts,</hi> who would not have that of <hi>Angels,</hi> though they might.</p>

               <p>ANd now I cannot better conclude this <hi>Treatise,</hi> then by giving you a short Character of the <hi>Ladies,</hi> chiefly mentioned in it; (and to say nothing of the Princess, who was yet so young, as she only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to be what her Mother was, and no doubt, but in time, she will make good her promises.) The Dutchess was one of the greatest Beauties of the times, and her Sister no less; but in a different kind, the one <hi>Fair,</hi> the other <hi>Brown;</hi> the one clear <hi>Sun-shine,</hi> the other a <hi>Delightful-shade;</hi> and as their Beauties, so their dispositions were alike; the Dutchess with all becoming freedom of one that was married, her Sister not so free, as one not married yet. The first all gay and chearful, the second not so gay, but with a chearfulness as far above light Mirth and Laughter, as Elemental Fire above Squibs and Crackers: For the rest, they were both so far from <hi>Pride,</hi> as nothing could be more humble, yet so majestical, as they appeared the higher by their <hi>Humility;</hi> and were in all so equal, as <hi>together,</hi> you knew not which to prefer; <hi>asunder,</hi> you always preferred the present to the absent, till she returning, set the ballance even again. In fine, not to enter so far into their praises, as never to get out again; in their presence, you were so ravished and transported, as you would as soon be weary of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as of their Company; and it was a species of the <hi>Beatitude,</hi> of the other <hi>Life,</hi> only to enjoy their conversation in this.</p>

               <head>To a Lady who was offended with him for praising <hi>Visdamera.</hi>
               </head>
               <l>I See you envy <hi>Visdamera</hi>'s praise,</l>
               <l>For excellent parts and qualities she has.</l>
               <l>Whil'st other parts and qualities y'have none,</l>
               <l>But bare and simple honesty alone.</l>
               <l>That's but a Cipher, Nothing, less ye add</l>
               <l>Some Vertue to't, by which 'tis Somewhat made.</l>
               <l>Or like a single Unite at the best,</l>
               <l>That but foundation is of all the rest.</l>
               <l>Mean time I can't, but wonder how it came</l>
               <l>To Honors title, and to Vertues name.</l>
               <l>When <hi>Honor</hi> and <hi>Vertue</hi> in it, there is none</l>
               <l>But only in Imagination.</l>
               <l>Cease then in vain, your Honesty to boast,</l>
               <l>That's but a Negative Vertue at the most.</l>
               <l>And like the <hi>Quakers Spirit</hi> seen by none,</l>
               <l>But we must take your word for it alone.</l>
               <l>And know, if't make you proud, 'tis better be</l>

               <l>HOw good is God! whose love of us transcends</l>

               <l>He knows our weakness and infirmities,</l>
               <l>And when we fall, helps us again to rise.</l>
               <l>And when h'as lost us, seeks us all about;</l>
               <l>Nor ever rests until he finds us out.</l>
               <l>When he's so far from chiding us, he's more</l>

                  <l>As none with you for <hi>beauty</hi> may compare.</l>

                  <l>Although of none more truly then of you,</l>
                  <l>Whose colours are no <hi>Painted ones,</hi> but true;</l>

               <head>Prologue for most of our Modern Plays.</head>
               <l>YOu'd have new <hi>Plays,</hi> and when you have'em you</l>
               <l>Do by 'em as <hi>Children</hi> by their <hi>Puppets</hi> do.</l>
               <l>Tear 'em and mangle 'em strait, then cry for more,</l>
               <l>And use 'em just as you did those before.</l>
               <l>And, reason of this is now, if <hi>truth</hi> were known,</l>
               <l>You are not <hi>curious,</hi> but <hi>fastidious</hi> grown:</l>
               <l>Nor is it <hi>Iudgment</hi> in you, but disease,</l>
               <l>That no new <hi>Plays,</hi> though ne'er so good, can please.</l>
               <l>And this is all, <hi>thanks</hi> and <hi>reward</hi> he has,</l>
               <l>Gives <hi>Children Puppets,</hi> and who gives you <hi>Plays.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And now they serve you in your kind you see,</l>
               <l>For most o'th' <hi>Plays</hi> are only <hi>Puppetry.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And you as unto <hi>Puppet-Plays</hi> do go,</l>
               <l>Not for to hear the <hi>wit,</hi> but see the <hi>show:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>The curious <hi>Painted Scenes,</hi> which <hi>Wit</hi> you call</l>
               <l>With <hi>Cheapside-Pageantry,</hi> and that is all.</l>

                  </l>
                  <l>And when I've done but that, I have my ends.</l>
                  <l>For th'vulgar I so much their praises slight,</l>
                  <l>I wou'd not have their favor, though I might;</l>
                  <l>Because, I know, none ever had it yet,</l>
                  <l>But only such who viciously have writ.</l>

                  <l>I must confess, he's valianter then I,</l>
