            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Of which duly considering, and ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in my minde, it did in some measure perswade me to a periode of this by mee now published, before I had put penne to paper, to write, being daily experienced, that where one suckes honey, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther followeth, and thence sucketh poyson; for it is a thing most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, to please the humours and fantasies of all men. But when I remembred the cause I had to handle, which was for the publique good of my Countrey, to admonish them to take heede by other mens hurts and harmes, and for feare it should slip out of their mindes, This person <hi>Francis Robinson,</hi> his haynous act most remarke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and deplorable downefall, becomes my subiect, to write; insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating mee thereunto, and encouraging mee, not to neglect my intended and good determination to a generality, for feare of the barking and contradicting spirits of our age, but to performe

But such is the depraued and corrupt nature of all Mankinde, and Sathans subtilty (mans mortall enemy) that dayly goeth about, and labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by all meanes possible he can, to blindfolde vs, stopping vs out of the way wherein God hath appointed vs to walke, and the example of Gods children that haue trod out the way before vs. Oh how much do these our daies wherin we now liue (shew vs the too true experience of the same) that mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes for company sake, conioyne themselues in all maner of mischiefe, and runne in heapes with delight, to commit most abhominable sins, presuming on Gods patience, because he doth not presently punish, saying in the pride of their hearts, and glory of their wicked sinnes, Doth the Lord s√©e, marke, or regard the d√©eds and actions, of the sonnes of men? No, they say tush, He regards them not: And thus the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill by this meanes, gets holde of multitudes, and bringes them in the end, to shame, hell, and destruction; for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and wages of Sinne is death.</p>
            <p>Let me now my worthy Country-men, present vnto your view, the experienced reward of sinfull delights, which latey
<pb facs="tcp:18873:5"/>
befell a Gentleman by name <hi>Francis Robinson,</hi> well descended, educated, and fostred tenderly, who happening into euill company, quickly, by the lewde examples, and dispositions of others, was brought to be as wicked, and as bad as themselues, for the Deuill doth make wicked men to doe, what he cannot doe himselfe (that is) to bring men to sinne and shame, by lewd mens inticings, examples and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, to doe as they doe, to walke in their steps and wayes of wickednes, merrily to passe away their times and dayes whilst here they liue, by which tossing, carousing, and iollitie of life, they become altogether forgetfull of God, and the meanes of their saluation, which to red√©eme from the Iawes of Hell, a whole world and to late repentance then small auailes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remember</hi> O y√©e youthfull Gallants <hi>now your Creator in the dayes of your youth,</hi> and cast not off the yoke of God from your necke, when you are young, least he reiect you, when your strength and eye-sight faile you; that is, in your olde age: learne to tread now the pathes of his holy wayes, if ye would be assured to come to the place of his euerlasting happines, for the Lord hateth, and vtterly abhorreth all the workes and workers of sinne and iniquitie: but those that loue and feare him he maketh much of them. That you shall see, and say with the Prophet <hi>Dauid,</hi> Psalme 58. verse 10. <hi>Doubtlesse there is a God that Iudgeth the Earth, that he is a iust God and loueth righteousnes, and hateth iniquitie, repay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vengeance vnto them that delight in the same,</hi> my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing sequell shall declare vnto you: example doth daily testifie, and at this present confirmes the same. I pray God the wanton and roaring Gallants of this our Age, may by them be warned, but much it is to be feared they will not: If they will not, let them take h√©ede as they goe for company, they hang not for company, wherat, for ought I doe perceiue they make a scoffe and scorne, to thinke in that manner of dying they dye valiantly, when that it is ind√©ed most despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, deuillish and damnable, and sauours no whit of the least sparke of Gods grace, but of contempt of God, and the
<pb facs="tcp:18873:5"/>
ripe fruit of Sathans bondslaues, which is to commit sinne, and to boast and bragge of the same, to be the full height of a reprobate soule, from which good Lord deliuer vs all.</p>

               <head>Now to confirme you how this Gentleman, as he himselfe related to me, fell, obserue what followeth.</head>
               <p>SO soone as euer he was brought into the Gaole of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi> he looked round about him, and earnestly entreated those that stoode by him, to take heede of Papists, and euill company, for they were the cause of his destruction. From the Lodge he was conuayed by the Keepers into the common Gaole, where he remained some two houres, on Tuesday the tenth day of Nouember, from which side he was remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to the Maister side by Warrant, from the right Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Sir <hi>Henry Mountague,</hi> Lord Chiefe Iustice of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> who for the same was most hartily and humbly thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and counted it, as well it did deserue, a great fauour from my Lord, there to sequester him, the better to prepare and fit him for his end. And that no meanes might be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to worke that good worke in him of repentance, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and assurance of his saluation, like a good Samaritane that Honourable and religious Iudge, as h√©e had wounded him by denouncing his iust Iudgement of deserued death, which is to flesh and blood most fearefull and vnwelcome, yet such was his Honorable care towards him, which is worthy of remembrance, what lay in his power hee did to comfort him, and in nothing more appeared the same, then in the sending of my painefull Brother and fellow labourer in Gods worke (Maister <hi>Pricket</hi>) who did most grauely and wisely apply to his distressed soule (such comfort) as that I doe constantly bel√©eue, the lost sheepe was brought home againe to the folde of Iesus Christ.</p>
               <p>Whereof most constantly <hi>Robinson</hi> said, he was assured: for the spirit of God did inwardly confirme the same to him, vndoubtedly to bel√©eue it, of which most comfortable words

and effectuall working, we were most glad, and ioyfull, that to our weake meanes, God rich in mercy, had giuen and sent such a blessing and cooperation. Thus s√©eing our industrie and labour begin to prosper to the glory of God, the sauing and winning to God a sinfull soule, I was bolde to put my Sickle into another mans Haruest, and bestowed likewise my poore willing paines and industry: with what they were I haue here published, and what effect they tooke, I praise God, I laboured not in vaine, but found a hungry and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie soule, apt and ready, to receiue them from my hands, and the fruites thereof, repentance, contrition, and faith.</p>

               <p>VVHen there was warrant out for his apprehension,<note place="margin">Note this<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
                  </note> he then was in <hi>Darby,</hi> and hearing that there was waite laide for him, posted thence some sixe miles, but had not the power any further to trauell, but returned to <hi>Darby,</hi> to goe and Iustifie his foule fact, which by the narrow loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king into, and examining of a Lawyer there inhabiting, with whome he was at variance, his designes were discouered.</p>
               <p>When he was thus discouered, and sent vp to <hi>London</hi> to the right Honourable the Lord Chauncellor of England, by whom he was examined, and vrged to confesse, that his foule fact of high Treason: stood stoutly in the deniall of the same. But h√©e that sitteth in Heauen laughed him to scorne, and most wonderfully disclosed the secret of his heart, and his foule fact, whereof he thought none should haue knowne, for being re-examined by the right Hon: Sir <hi>Henry Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague</hi> Knight, Lord chiefe Iustice of England, to him as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly he did, denyed his foule fact, but behold h√©ere how the
<pb facs="tcp:18873:7"/>
hand of God laide holde on him, and how the eye of God was watching ouer him, and disclosed him, by deliuering a Key to <hi>Humphrey Smith,</hi> to goe to a Truncke, wherein his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit Commission was, and diuers other writings.</p>
               <p>It pleased Almighty God, who teacheth all mens hearts wisdome, that the right Hon: the Lord Chiefe Iustice thus bethought himselfe, to know the truth, s√©eing as yet he could get no knowledge, he set spies to watch those that had accesse vnto him, to finde out by them, this foule fact, which most miraculously by the carefull examination of <hi>Humphrey Smith</hi> (by that graue Iudge Sir <hi>Heury Mountague</hi>) came soone to light thereof, who tolde his Hon: of a Truncke of writings: which so strangely discouered, <hi>Robinson</hi> thereat was greatly amazed, thinking it a thing impossible to be knowne at all to any; who when that he saw he was disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, betooke himselfe (of an obstinate denyer) to become an humble, contrite, and sorrowfull confessor of what he had done, and implored mercy and fauour at honourable persons hands, of whome he little deserued the same. But he out of his most Noble disposition, denyed not any the least of his requests, and humble suites, but buryed all his former vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deseruings, in the bowels of pitty and compassion, grieuing to s√©e what a most wretched course he had runne, that the Iustice of the King, and his Lawes, did iustly challenge his deserued deoth.</p>
               <p>Nay further note and consider I pray you, for these were the wordes proc√©eding out of his owne mouth: how God did make his owne wisdome to be foolishnesse, therewith to laugh himselfe to scorne, that presuming he had some sound iudgement and true knowledge in the Law, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which h√©e too much built and relyed, for his knowledge therein, was but the flash of pride &amp; presumption: for when the right Worshipfull, graue, wise and learned in the Law (Sir <hi>Henry Yeluerton</hi> his Maiesties Atturney Generall) heard, said, that his intention, made the Law to take holde on him, he thereat was silenced, and confessed his blindnes, and ignorance, and that his eyes were shut, and heart infatuated
<pb facs="tcp:18873:7"/>
euen vnto the day of his tryall, in which it pleased God to reueale to him, his grosse mistaking of the Law, and guilt in this his foule fact, which when he well and plainely percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; he then remembred that portion of Scripture which he formerly had read in the 3. Chap. of <hi>Ieremy,</hi> which stroake re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse of conscience in him, and that the whole world might take notice that the Iudgements of God had ouertaken him, aduisedly coated the place recited for memory, that men should feare to offend in the like case, least they come to haue in the end the like reward for their paines.</p>
               <p>Lastly, he confessed the person, and first occasion that drew him to commit his foule fact, which was (Couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes) the foundation of all mischiefe. And lodging at the Swan at <hi>Charing Crosse,</hi> there he grew acquainted with one (<hi>Morgan</hi> a Romish Catholicke) whom he tolde of his thirsting after money, who then shewed the fruites of his Religion, to bring by his wicked deuice, the body of this Gentleman to his destruction, and (had not God in his great mercy preuented the same destroyed) his soule also, for he went the right way thereunto, by crafty seducing of him to become a Papist. And thus, he leauing and for saking his God, and Religion, his sodaine downefall afterwards hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, the which he heartily prayed to Almighty God might teach, warne, and terrifie others from the like attempt: and thus spake that morning a little before h√©e receiued the most holy and blessed Sacrament, of the Supper of our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, (said<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>) that <hi>Morgan</hi> did seduce him first, from his Religion, and after that, his heart was inclinable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, what <hi>Morgans</hi> poysoned tongue of mischiefe would speake, of which kinde of people and their Religion, h√©e desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all people to beware and to flye their Doctrine, it tending onely to mischiefe and destruction.</p>

               <p>Of all the people in generall, he heartily craued pardon, that he had beene a Runnagate from their blessed Societie, heartily desiring their prayers vnto Almighty God for him.

And presuming too much vpon that small vnderstanding and knowledge he had in the Law, of himselfe drew the forme of a Commission, and thereinto inserted to make it beare the more validity, the names of diuers worthy Attendants about his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Court and most Royall person, to them from his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie directed, in his Maiesties name to aske, cease, leuie, and receiue in foure seuerall Shieres in this Kingdome, certaine seuerall summes of money, according to the tenure of their Commission, to them from his Maiestie directed.</p>
               <p>This forged Commission being by him alone inuented, and trecherously deuised, brought it to a Scriuener in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> where hee had the same ingrossed, and without the knowledge or priuity of any, did put thereunto a counterfait great Seale, for the true great Seale of <hi>England,</hi> and so by vertue thereof, though none at all there was, did aske, leuie, and receiue at seuerall sittings in Commission, though no lawfull authority he had thereunto, the summe of twenty eight pounds and fiue pence deceitfully, of the Kings liege people. And this he did for the space of a moneth continue and proc√©ede, not thinking of the all s√©eing eye of Almighty God, that would discouer him, and suddainly confound him, and his most wicked deuice, whereof when he least imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, or suspected, euen then bewrayed his treacherous heart and detestable fact.</p>
               <p>After the time of his apprehension for this most detestable and foule fact, behold how stedfastly he stoode in the Iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the same, and vsed the name of a worthy Knight, Sir <hi>Robert Maxwell,</hi> to say he had his priuity and help ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, (of which) he in the least manner was not acquainted; and for which his most false and vniust aspersion on him, at the time of his death, on his kn√©es, and salt teares fast trick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling downe, most humbly, and heartily craued, his fr√©e par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning

of him for the same: and said, it was the Diuels inticing of him, to doe what he did (namely) that foule and filthy treacherous d√©ede of his, and that which did much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict and terrifie his soule, more then Death it selfe, whose grim countenance he did behold so to accuse an innocent guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, worshipfull, and worthy Gentleman, that thereby himselfe who onely was guilty of that foule fact, might be fr√©ed; whereof God in his Iustice would not approue, nor be so deluded, but brought him the plotter, contriuer, and actor of villany, to receiue his iust reward for the same, that the mischiefe by him pretended, to light on others, did at the last fall on his owne pate. And the net and snare which hee had priuily layd, and secretly spread abroade to intrap ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, therein himselfe was ensnared.</p>
               <p>And thus he concluded: Let all take h√©ede, and beware of couetousnes, content themselues with that they haue, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour honestly with their hands for their owne liuing: for the honest and industrious Labourer, God will for euer blesse, but they that doe trust in lying vanities, to get wealth by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull meanes and wiles, let them know, said hee, that though God for a while forbeare them, yet his Iustice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires to render vengeance to them, as iustly on me now he hath done.</p>
               <p>Like a Lambe going to the slaughter so went he vnto his death, prepared before to suffer the same, willingly, patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ioyfully: and our confidence is such of him, that he is receiued into the Fold of that most blessed heauenly Flocke, whereof <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> the great Sh√©epheard of vs all is the keeper and defender, and into which number, the Lord Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty in his aboundant mercy giue grace to all, daily so to prepare themselues, that in the end they may be found wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy thereof. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <p>THus deare Country-men<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> haue I exercised your pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and boldly presumed to incurre your censures, for the zeale that I beare to the soules of men, destring, and dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hartily praying to Almighty God, that his downefall may make all others wary, and carefull to flye sinne, the reward whereof, and to the delighters therein, you haue heard. And although God in his mercy deferres to punish, expecting mens conuersion, which if they doe not in his expected time, hee payes home in the end, such their neglect of him, with most fearefull and vnrecouerable downefalls.</p>
