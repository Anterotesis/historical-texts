         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of all the Officers of the Army, the reſult whereof
may have a great influence on the affaires of this diſtracted
Kingdome. Out of a fervent deſire of my Countries good;
I have taken the holdneſſe to repreſent to your Excellency,
and the reſt of that Honourable Councell, an abſtract of ſome
particulars out of your formerly Printed papers, containing
your worthy expreſsions to promote, with the freedome, the
Peace of this Nation, by tender reſpect to all Eſtates there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.
How popular thoſe expreſsions rendred your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency,
and the Army under your Command, I need not now
tell your Excellency, nor them: Nor need I expreſſe what
contrary effects any receſsion from thoſe expreſsions, and
propoſals may worke, if in ſo hopefull a circumſtance of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires
for Peace, there ſhould be any interpoſition from you,
to frustrate the preſent expectation of the cloſure of our
breach upon any pretences contrariant to thoſe expreſsions
incloſed, ſo deliberately penn'd, aud generally communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the eyes of all the Nation. Mutability in men of your
places, is in it ſelf a thing too unſutable: but in a caſe of this
nature, It cannot but be lookt upon as the fruit of the turne
of private intereſt (the publique being ſtill the ſame;) And
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55384:4"/>
for men that have done ſo much for the Publique, to move
on the hinge of private intereſt, in a buſineſſe of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment,
how greatly it may obſcure your preſent reſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
glory, I hope you will rather foreſee in reaſon, then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
to read it in the black letters of ſad experience.
<hi>Verbum ſapienti.</hi> I will conclude with hope, and prayer,
that God will ſo direct you, that you will promte the happy
hoped for clooſure of our diſtractions, and crowne all
your former Victories over others, with this victory over
all private intereſt in your ſelves, to promote the Publique,
which is moſt manifeſtly involved in a good Peace.</p>

againſt their deſires, but Principles, to impriſon the King,
or uſe Him uncivilly. <hi>And I hope their Principles are
the ſame ſtill.</hi>

            <p>2. They declare their belief; that there cannot be any Peace
to the Kingdome firme, or laſting, without a due conſideration
of, and proviſion for the rights, quiet, and immunities of His
Majeſties Royall Family, and His late partakers.</p>
            <p>3. That they come lower in moderating rigour to the Kings
Party then the Houſes, bringing the parties exempted to five (the
Parliament holds up to ſeaven:) And the five not condemn'd
to death, but reſerv'd to the further judgement of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as they ſhall ſee cauſe.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>After all they move for a generall Act of Oblivion in
as full tearmes as may be, and very rationally, to prevent future
diſturbance of the State.</hi> Whence from their owne pens it muſt ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitably
follow, that if they (under pretence of Juſtice) ſhall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbe
this preſent Treaty, or uſe (to ſay no worſe) any uncivility
to the King; They ſhall recede from their owne Principles, render us
uncapable of a peace firme and laſting; which the late experience
ſince the Vote of No addreſſes may more clear unto us. And if ſuch an
attempt be not deſtructive to this poor Kingdome; the world may,
God will rightly judge.</p>
