            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Edwards</hi> his Booke, he calleth an <hi>Anti-Apologie:</hi> With a large but mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt anſwer thereunto.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Muſt begin complaining; Alas (Sir) how doe you diſparage your own judgement, when you doe hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken after mine? But it is a friendly error, I muſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don it; and more, I will grant your earneſt requeſt alſo. How can he chooſe, but yeeld to you, what can be yeelded, who are all for <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> purſuing it with all your might; Now Bleſſings be upon your head, (and the head of yours) who have laid-out your ſelfe and all for God: He will returne (for man will not, nay indeed power is wanting, though will more, he cannot) all your <hi>labour of love, worke of faith, patience of hope</hi> ſeven-fold into your boſome, <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, Sir, me thinks you and I are Inſtruments now meerely paſſive, you, in the motion to this undertaking; I, in the undertaking; wrought upon both, by a power, and counſell, higher and better then our owne; I conceive it ſo in you, by what I heard you ſay, you had concluded upon between your ſoule and God. I conceive the ſame of my ſelfe, becauſe I never thought of this, nay my mind was wholly averſe from ſcribling, till I thought of your Letter, and then I could thinke of nothing elſe, and was reſtleſſe till I had anſwered you. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (Sir) there was an hand here more then humane; a ſtronger mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on our ſpirits, than ſelfe can make; A bond, which is more bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and engaging then the bonds of men are, Gods Cauſe, with his Legacy to the world, <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Peace.</hi> And now all is engaged, <hi>body, ſoul, spirit, judgement</hi> alſo, that is little or nothing indeed; But He

can uſe it, and direct it, Who uſeth the ſmalleſt things to great pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Ile waight upon the Lord; as He ſhall communicate unto me, I ſhall give-back unto you, even from His own hand: For I thinke it is the deſire of my ſoule, <hi>willingly to offer my ſelfe</hi> with all the powers <note place="margin">2 Chro 17. 16.</note> of ſoule and body firſt <hi>unto the LORD</hi> (Indeed I would not have <note place="margin">

Nor ſhall you make judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by what followeth, that I am for the <hi>Independency</hi> (as I foole have called it) nor for the <hi>Preſbiterie</hi> neither, and Governement that way. I profeſſe unto you, Theſe words are ſo toſſed to and fro by ſuch ſimple ones as my ſelfe, that I cannot tell what to make of them, or which way to take: And yet can ſee the <hi>way</hi> cleered before me, the <hi>Church way</hi> paſt all queſtion, for there the Scripture is cleere: when yet, where it ſpeaketh out cleerly at the firſt ſight, for <hi>Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie;</hi> me thinks at the ſecond view (and that ſhould be, as our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thoughts are, the wiſer) it ſpeaketh all for <hi>Independency.</hi> So that I have not underſtanding enough (the Lord be a light and help unto it) to tell my ſelfe for what way I am, unleſſe for both, as they may both lead each to other, and meete in one. I am perſwaded in my heart that ſo it will be; they will accord, meete and kiſſe each other. Not that I can thinke the difference to be ſmall, about which there is ſo great difference: nor the <hi>way</hi> of governement eaſily diſcernable, ſith ſo many quick-ſighted men are prying thereinto, yet cannot find it out. But this is the ground of my perſwaſion; becauſe the <hi>ſeekers</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this <hi>way,</hi> doe, I hope, <hi>ſeeke Him,</hi> That makes a path in a wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51219:3"/>
and are fully reſolved to continue ſeeking; and in their diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition here, to keepe themſelves cloſe-up to the <hi>clue</hi> of the ſacred Scriptures: and to ſhut-out <hi>paſſion,</hi> which, a Noble Schollar (of large underſtanding the <hi>Lord</hi> fill it with himſelfe) calls <hi>nothing:</hi> for ſo much as there is of paſſion, in the Diſpute, ſo much there is of nothing to the purpoſe. The very beſt Miniſters in the world are jealous over themſelves in this matter, and as watchfull. They are zealouſly affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted towards Church Governement in a Church <hi>way;</hi> their <hi>zeale</hi> may goe-forth at the diſpute about it, and <hi>paſſion</hi> may get in. Then Reaſons, like a bad hound, ſpeeds upon a falſe ſent, and forſakes the queſtion firſt ſtarted. Sir, you are at the end of my Preface, now to my undertaking; The <hi>Authour</hi> firſt, then to his <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> and ſo to the <hi>Booke,</hi> and ſome <hi>reſolves</hi> thereupon, and then an end. The <hi>Authour;</hi> you are pleaſed to Name him, ſo will I for honour ſake: But before I come at him I will reach forth my hand unto him, and my heart, for theſe ſhall never goe ſingle. My heart is towards him, and to <hi>God</hi> for him, That the <hi>Lord</hi> would ſhine upon him, and his gifts, that ſo neither he nor they may runne-out any more to <hi>waſte;</hi> as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and graces doe, which doe not promote the Glory of God, and the ſalvation of ſoules: Now I am come to him, I ſuſpect my ſelfe and my loving reſpects towards him, leaſt they carry me beyond my bounds in his commendation. Truly I cannot tell in what one thing the man is wanting to make him compleat, except in <hi>Charity;</hi> that is a great exception, and ſome ſay he is ſo wanting therein, that he has no <hi>charity</hi> at all, yet that is the <hi>everlasting grace,</hi> and compleats all: yea ſome doe not ſtraine to ſay, he is a man of a <hi>malignant spirit,</hi> and he hath ſhewed forth openly nothing elſe (he muſt be content to fall under cenſure.) Truly I think they ſay not well, and ſo good he thinks himſelfe, he cares not what they ſay (and there he may be too careleſſe;) But for my part, I would rather I could ſay, he is a man of an <hi>excellent ſpirit,</hi> but then my love tranſporting me, I ſhould ſay too much: Yet this I muſt ſay; he is very high in my thoughts, (not a whit higher in others account) almoſt as he is in his owne: and he hath improved his growth not a little within theſe foure yeares; for then he was matched by, <hi>he knoweth whom:</hi> (ſurely the <hi>Lord</hi> would have had him accounted that as a <hi>ſpetting in his face)</hi> and now he hath attained to that height in the eyes of all the learned, that he is too tall a match for a woman. Good man! (Indeed the beſt have their
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51219:4"/>
failings) God hath left him to himſelfe, as he hath ſaid of his Brethren, <hi>To try him, that he might know all that was in his</hi>

And here I could tell the Reader ſomething from thence, from what I know; more what I heard from an excellent Maſter in Iſrael, and his beſt Diſciples in <hi>Hartford.</hi> But I muſt not doe that my ſelfe, which I muſt reprove in him, for I never ſpake with him about it, neither alone nor before others. Nor would I, for a world, render <hi>Gath</hi> and <hi>Askelon</hi> debtors unto me, <hi>Briſtoll</hi> and <hi>Oxford:</hi> God forbid, That I ſhould give the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> there matter of rejoycing: or the <hi>uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed</hi> there, cauſe of <hi>Triumph.</hi> Whether the reverend Authour of this <hi>Anti-Apolog:</hi> hath not more rejoyced the Adverſaries to the Truth, than edified her Friends in their moſt holy Faith, requires his moſt retired ſerious and ſaddeſt thoughts; That ſo he may, as he may ſee cauſe, give check to his buſie pen: (in his zeal for God and his cauſe, he hath given his word, he will not ceaſe writing) lest, while in his zeal for the beating-out and clearing the Truths of God, and the way of his Servants, he darkens thoſe Truths, and layes ſcandals in the way, whereby to grieve the Brethren, and rejoyce the <hi>enemies to all Righteouſneſſe.</hi> And then the more paines he takes, the more worke he makes for repentings. The Lord be a Light and Guide unto him now, That his after-labour may be a <hi>labour of love;</hi> and his worke, <hi>a worke of Faith;</hi> Then may he be <hi>patient in hope,</hi> That he ſhall ſee the <hi>travell of his ſoule.</hi> So I would beſpeake him now and aſſure him, That neither his Perſon nor his Graces have one graine the leſſe waight in my eſteeme, becauſe he is for the <hi>Preſbyterian-way:</hi> So are they, and they the moſt the ſavour of whoſe Graces are now, as is the ſavour of the ſweeteſt oyntmeut all over the Houſe and houſhold of God: for they are for That way, whatever we call it, which they are perſwaded is the way of Chriſt. And the Searcher of all hearts knowes my deſire touching him, is, 1. That he, for after time, may give no occaſion to thoſe with-out to blaſpheme; or to them with-in, To thinke, he is againſt the ſtrictneſſe and purity of the way of Chriſt. 2. And that not one drop of the Anointing he has received from the Father may run-out in vaine; but that in his purſuance after peace, he may maintaine the peace of the Church, by all meanes, <hi>Keeping the

            <p>This ſhall follow now, which is ſo cleare in the <hi>Booke</hi> we have in hand, that the R.

If a man ſhould ſet himſelfe, as he hath done, to ſpie-out (not as King <hi>Joſiah</hi> did, which is every mans duty, what idols of jealouſie are ſet-up in the heart, and in the Land) but what are, or were the carriages of the <hi>Moſeſſes</hi> there; he might obſerve miſcarriages even in them, though the meekeſt men upon earth.

If there be any virtue, any praiſe, think on theſe things,</hi> let theſe bound your own thoughts, yea and your thoughts alſo touching your bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; It is not ſo cleare in the text, but it is according to the practiſe of all the godly, that ever have been or are in the world.

And as their words were, ſuch and ſo ſutable were their thoughts. But when theſe are to ſpeake of their brethren, then you may reade their thoughts in their words; <hi>Whatſoever things are true, honeſt, juſt, pure, lovely, of good report: If there be any vertue, any praiſe, they thinke,</hi> and they ſpeake of thoſe things. <hi>Jobs,</hi> and <hi>Jeremiahs</hi> impatience, not a ſyllable touching that matter; you ſhall heare <hi>of the patience of Job.</hi> Whatſoever things are lovely, of good report, if there be any virtue, if any praiſe, this you ſhall heare from the tongues, and pens of good men, for they <hi>thinke on theſe things.</hi> And indeed it is according to a notable rule in <hi>Heraldry,</hi> I can but point to it <note n="a" place="margin">

He is called Satan an <hi>Adverſary;</hi> A Devill too, <hi>an accuſer of the bretheren;</hi> If any man now will take the Devill his office, accuſe the bretheren, divulge their faults, oh how the Devill rejoyceth at this, how glad his ſervants are! Be the accuſation true, or be it falſe, that matters not, the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theren are accuſed, the Devill and his ſervants laugh. An <hi>Iſralite</hi> ſtrives with an <hi>Iſralite;</hi> oh how pleaſant a ſight is this! It will pluck back and hinder the <hi>Great-worke</hi> in hand as once it did, thinks the Devill, then he laughes, and huggs this hope; and are not all his ſervants as merry? ſurely the Devill and his ſervants are dancing now (for joy) now he ſees thoſe ſtruck at, whom he hates heartily; and thoſe doctrines oppoſed, which are the very deſtruction of his kingdome. Surely no good man will help to make the Devill muſick; then, ſure enough, he will not make ſuch a booke, as this, <hi>for this is muſick for the Devill.</hi> You tell me you mourne over it; I beleeve you, and that every good man mourneth with you; but he that hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the offence, much more muſt he m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
