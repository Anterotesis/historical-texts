            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>Prison</hi> is a Cage of unclean Birds; not that they are unclean of themselves, but that their nasty Attendants desire to have them appear <hi>unclean Beasts</hi> like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. <hi>Augeus Stables</hi> had dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Grooms, if compar'd to their Chamberlains. The whole Prospect of this forlorn <hi>Room</hi> is a <hi>Grate</hi>; where through every transenn, every stancher, those incaged <hi>Birds</hi> may take a view of the <hi>Iron Age.</hi> They say, Spirits walk there; but very few Spirits to entertain the least por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Compassion. This <hi>Cacus Cave</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:102167:6"/>
to the <hi>Lions Den</hi>; Turn once the Ward, — <hi>Et vestigia nulla retrorsum.</hi> Her <hi>Walls,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of Darnicks, Arras, and Tapistry, are commonly interwoven with <hi>Ariadnes</hi> Cawls, <hi>Spider-webs,</hi> and such like over-worn Trophies of Antiquity. The <hi>Cimmerians</hi> in their Dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, resemble these in their Lodgings; onely their Lights are different: Those receive some scattered Beamlings by their Mountain-Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; these by their forlorn Loop-holes. Her constant Inhabitants, to their dis-comfort, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain such <hi>Back-biters,</hi> that though they give them sustenance, yet they <hi>startle</hi> them sleeping and waking with their too obsequious adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. The <hi>Musique</hi> of this House, holds in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort with the <hi>Trapezites,</hi> all <hi>Iron.</hi> If her <hi>Meniey</hi> were as constant in their <hi>Affection,</hi> as in their <hi>Mansion</hi>; as firmly link'd in the bonds of <hi>fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> as in their <hi>Links</hi> of a necessitated Society, they were a brave amicable Family. Either her own parcimony, or her In-mates penury is such, as she keeps no <hi>Open-house.</hi> So short is she in her wages, and so spare in her solace, as her Servants are weary of her before an end of their first quarters service. She's careless from whence they come, but infinitely cautious how they goe away. And if they goe away without her favour, they are in great danger to break their necks for their labour.</p>

                  <hi>II.</hi> The Anatomy of a Iaylor.</head>
               <p>HE is a brave boisterous Blade; one who has made a contract with his tongue and look: with the latter to look ugly; with the other to speak harshly. He is a cunning Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coner; and with his imperious <hi>Whistle</hi> keeps his <hi>mu'd fowl</hi> in such command, as they hold themselves blessed when they are without the sound of his call.</p>
               <p>He is active in the exercise of his Mannacles, Boults, and Fetters. He binds his <hi>Apprentices</hi> to such hard conditions, as some are enforced with the loss of their lives to purchase their freedom. He is so richly disciplined in the <hi>Aray</hi> of <hi>Oaths</hi> and <hi>Curses,</hi> as he has learn'd to damn his unhappy Family with no less facility than felicity. This makes the Devil hugg him Morning and Evening, charging him to go on in his Work, and he shall be sure of his Wages. His onely Fees derive their gratui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties from the sins of the people. If you tell him of the <hi>Iaylor</hi> in the <hi>Acts</hi>; he either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves not the Story: or he calls him a White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd Officer to make Conscience his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander. He is of such a base quality, as to feed himself, he starves his Meniey. Shreeks, groans and <hi>Lachrymae</hi> are his delicious harmony.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102167:7"/>
He has so dis-used himself to Civility, as he cannot utter one word of comfort, to gain him a Kingdom. If his poor famished family receive a reward; it returns to his Ward. While they, poor Souls, pray for their Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors: He becomes whole Sharer. The poor <hi>Prisoners Box</hi> is his <hi>Exchequer</hi>; his <hi>Prisoners,</hi> his <hi>Spongies</hi>; their <hi>ruine,</hi> his <hi>raising</hi>; their <hi>famine,</hi> the improvement of his <hi>fortune.</hi> All his <hi>Keyes</hi> are made for <hi>Spring-locks</hi>; they will shut of themselves, but never open.</p>
               <p>This surly <hi>Mastive</hi> glories in nothing more than in displeasing; and where he dare not bite, to be snarling. He makes more disheart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Spirits tremble one day, than he did for his sins all his life. His onely triumph is over mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery: and his resolution to exclude mercy. He hath no time to pray, lest he should neglect his charge. Yet for a fat bribe in a Corner, he will not stick to truck with his well-lin'd <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner:</hi> though by his voluntary escape he haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard an halter. Generally, he never looks up to heaven, but when he is posting to hell: and now the unaccustomed thought of his sins makes his Journey seem long and heavy: but let him comfort himself; it is all <hi>down-bank,</hi> and that will make it seem more easie.</p>

                  <hi>III.</hi> A Iaylors Wife.</head>
               <p>WE have done with <hi>Pluto</hi>; we are now to pluck one feather from the Wing of his dainty Duckling <hi>Proserpina.</hi> Would you have her <hi>Picture</hi> drawn to life? That curious <hi>Holland</hi> Artist <hi>Hans Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile,</hi> though he had the absolutest fancy in pourtraying the Devil, could not do it if he were living: yet we will <hi>shadow,</hi> though we cannot to her full body so exquisitely <hi>limn</hi> her.</p>
               <p>For her Constitution and Composition, they suit as neerly with her <hi>Iaylors</hi> Disposition, as <hi>Charon</hi> and <hi>Acheron.</hi> Since the very hour that she put her Wedding-ring on her knotty finger, it has been her highest ambition to mould her self to her surly Husbands humor: and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve his deportment in every posture. The Wheel of her tongue is of a perpetual motion; yet generally she <hi>spits</hi> as much as she <hi>speaks</hi>; wherein I must caution you to keep your di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; and not to come within the compass of her <hi>Sent</hi>; for the very steam which drills from her <hi>fluets,</hi> retains more venome than the foam of a mad Dogg. She's an intollerable Slut; yet he that should venture to call her so, might be sure to have a dark <hi>Lobby</hi> for his lodging. Any one
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:102167:8"/>
may smell her, before he see her; so strongly is she chafed with Kitching pomander. She has usually more fat on her skirts, than many of her starv'd Meniey have on their Ribs. Her A pricock Nose is a common Sewer, ever run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; so as her tongue cannot be more active, than that is fluent. To save a Faggot, every Winter Morn, she makes fuell of her Maids; bestowing more <hi>basting</hi> of them, than she doth on her meat. Her complexion (lest you should neglect her when you see her) holds near resemblance to a parcel of scorched Lard: yet she has a conceit there is not a morsel about her, but infinitely deserves love. If she take notice of an handsom well-timbered Prisoner, that promiseth ability in his feature; She will not stick to reserve some of her best reversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for him, and cram him, not by way of Alms, but for her own benevolence. She changeth not her <hi>Clothes</hi> half so often as she doth her <hi>Maids.</hi> For her heavy houshold, though their appetite be strong, their repast is weak. Thus in a double restraint these poor wretches suffer; <hi>air</hi> and <hi>fare</hi>; thraldom and hunger; and in these, He has vow'd to keep them as short in the One, as She means to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge them in the Other. Yet it is strange; amidst all these dis-gusts, She's infinitely <hi>dear</hi> to her Guests. Now to bring her to bed, if her <hi>Iaylor</hi> lose her, you may be confident who
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102167:8"/>
will have her. But I perceive her diving, like the <hi>Spirit</hi> in the <hi>Vault</hi>; we will leave her to her long sleep; and thrice happy had many of her In-mates been if she had never wakt.</p>

               <p>ALL hail to <hi>Cerberus!</hi> how despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Cur looks? His uncertain <hi>revenues</hi> consist wholly of <hi>rewards:</hi> and these his unhallow'd Keys keep in the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference of their <hi>Wards.</hi> He has no other <hi>vails</hi> to support him; so as he becomes no less unnecessarily lasie, than necessarily lousie.</p>
               <p>The onely way to act <hi>Malevolo,</hi> is to fall into poverty. And he is already fallen upon that Rock. He cannot speak affably, if you should hang him; unless he observe an hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful visitant approaching his Gate: and then he labors to strain courtesie with his ingenerous inbred quality; and to open to him with an unmannerly congy. He is infinitely weary in doing nothing; and yet should you take him from his unprofitable vocations, he would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture to do somthing worse than nothing. He sleeps as much as he either eats or drinks: but that's not his fault, but his slow Benefactors:
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:102167:9"/>
for he has <hi>Ericthous</hi> bowels to receive, if he had any open-hearted <hi>Vitellius</hi> to give. He coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeits a pleasant shrug, upon the admittance of a well-crammed Prisoner; and his first morning visit must be reserv'd for his Chamber. Now, you must not conceive this to be out of any love to his Guest; but meerly for his Morning Draught and a Canonical Toast: which many times (bar basket reversions) serves him for his whole days repast. This Dogg in a doublet, should he be called to an account of his life, you should hear such a reckning as would partake more of <hi>Cannibal</hi> than <hi>Christian.</hi> He had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyred hours enough to say his Prayers in: but he held Devotion such an <hi>Antipos</hi> to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, as he mightily feared he should lose his place, by inuring his idle hours to any such pious pratice.</p>
               <p>And now after his long useless service, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in neither he himself reaped much profit, nor his Prisoners solace; looking with the <hi>Swan</hi> upon his feet, he perceives he has purchased some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that will stick near him, when all his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance leave him: Gout and Dropsie, which hale him along from his <hi>Porters-lodge</hi> to a low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Century.</p>

               <p>ARe men of the Livery. Red-coats, Blew-coats, Green-coats, White-coats; nay, Turn-coats in hope of better pay. They are as vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant and as prudent (for ought I know) as those watchful Birds of the Capitol. They are sufficiently indoctrinated in their words of command; which they use upon all occasions: <hi>Stand, who goes there?—Corporall!</hi> They are principally versed in <hi>Parades</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefs.</hi> They hold themselves privileged men by the Law of Arms: and scorn the repulse of a stranger, so long as they cling together. Night rovers are their best Benefactors. These, what occasion soever they pretend, must untruss, or let them be sure to suffer disgrace. Now should you single them out, and put them to any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terogatories, you were not to expect from them any resolutions in affairs of discipline (wherein they are generally better fed than taught:) for they hold it sufficient knowledge to return an account under what <hi>Captain</hi> they serve. For any other questions, it were needless for you to demand: seeing they are bound to answer no more than they know. Those <hi>Golden</hi> and <hi>Silver Shields</hi> in the <hi>Athenian</hi> Guards, were to their glory none of this <hi>Century.</hi> These are
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:102167:10"/>
onely known to their Country Arms: which they mean more <hi>ordinarily</hi> than <hi>orderly</hi> to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age upon any State-service. Some of these, to save their Hamlet an unnecessary charge; by their provident husbanding of their Powder; have not discharged their Muskets, since their first admittance to that military Order. They hold shedding of blood, be the quarrel never so fair nor cause just, to be a <hi>crying sin</hi>; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to clear their innocent souls from that soil, they have religiously vow'd never to draw (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it be upon great advantage) in their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. Yet like <hi>Garden-Doggs,</hi> they are very fierce on the night; especially if they be backt, and find a remisseness of spirit in their Assailant. Yet I would have their Spectators retain this opinion of them; that they are brave metall'd Blades, Sparks of honor; and such as will make their <hi>Centuries</hi> smoak again to display their val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. There is nothing but it may be usefully imployed to some end or other: this makes these terrible <hi>Myrmidons</hi> use their <hi>Match</hi> instead of <hi>Tinder,</hi> while others (more active in tossing a Pipe than a Pike) receive light from their labor. But nights are cold and long; and if Moon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, fuller of danger; for then Trees send forth their shadows, which at first fight resemble ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: But perceiving those shady Bushes to be no Foes, but meer Apparitions to delude them, they are content before their <hi>Reliefs</hi> to take a Nap; where we do leave them.</p>

               <p>IS one that is given to the flesh, as the flesh is given to him; for if otherwise, he might be as thin as other of his fellow-Rats, who feed on the same Commons, but batten not so well, for want of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction; or in that they have not such merry hearts to allay their affliction. This <hi>May</hi>-Bird can sing as sweetly in a <hi>Cage,</hi> as if he were in a <hi>Forrest.</hi> He accounts his imprisonment the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme of his life: and his life neither unhappier nor shorter by being a Prisoner. He findes free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in his greatest restraint; and that <hi>inward liberty</hi> which many Libertines who have the wide world to walk in, could never pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase.</p>
               <p>But these are <hi>Contemplative</hi> men, who make Heaven their Object; and consequently, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is here below, their Subject.</p>
               <p>Now, there be other <hi>fatlings</hi> who cram themselves in security. Their Pot, Pipe and merry company so besots them, as they make no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence at all betwixt bondage and liberty. These have put off all cares; and like Porkets in a Sty, feed without thought of provision; and like loose Epicures, turn from their Troughs without thansgiving. Wherein, though they ow to God for their Ordinary; yet such debts
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:102167:11"/>
retain least hold in their memory. You may see the world here drawn up in a small Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome. This Prison holds as much as the world: all her inhabitants are either good or bad. Here is a good Prisoner; and he makes <hi>contemplation</hi> his <hi>reflection</hi>: Divine Service is his Souls So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace. Nothing can confine him, because he finds nothing fit to entertain him, that Earth may afford him. This apprehension moves him to esteem of a Prison as a place of more free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom than the world; because he finds fewer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements to decline him from pursuit of his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture liberty, than he found in the world. Whereas that <hi>bad fatling</hi> or sensual Prisoner is content with any place, that may be-lull his cloudy understanding in a careless sleep. Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and bondage are indifferently equal to his fruitless pilgrimage; being neither beneficial to himself nor his neighbour in the One nor the Other.</p>
               <p>Now he who fats himself with true <hi>Hearts-ease,</hi> feeds his appetite with diviner hopes, than to satisfie it with the Prodigals husks.</p>

               <p>HE is a living Sceleton; a breathing Ghost; the remainder of a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter work; or the wasted porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Purveyors provision; or a shadow that has lost his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. This <hi>Iack-a-Lent,</hi> an old In-mate in that ancient Fabrick of <hi>Iohn</hi> a <hi>Gant,</hi> promiseth at the first sight as if he had put on the habit of some Hermit or Anachorite; having procured such a <hi>divorce</hi> from his flesh, as he had onely entred into <hi>Covenant</hi> with his spirit. But all is not Gold that glisters. Sanctity is not wholly confined to an Hermitage, nor Mortification to lean Chops and a pale visage. Spare bodies may have strong appetites. <hi>Cambletes</hi> was lean, though gluttonous; and <hi>Camillus</hi> fat, though abstemious. <hi>Wood</hi> of <hi>Kent</hi> had sere ribs, but a sore stomack. The lean, with <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Kine, are apt to devour the fat. But let us judge the best; for if his weak exhausted feature pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the defective reversions of a tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, he merits pity, bearing the Characters of his penury in such dying colours in his phys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy; but if marrow-eating Envy bring him to this infirmity, he may thank himself for his own malady. Now you shall take this for a constant rule, by how much more this <hi>Scare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crow</hi>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:102167:12"/>
is estranged from the flesh; by so much neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is he allyed to the Spirit: you shall scarcely find one in an age to parallel <hi>Galba</hi>'s constitution, to have a quick enlivened brain, and a gross cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulent bulk. The leanest body, the activest spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Nay generally partaking most of that inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious humor of <hi>Melancholy,</hi> he becomes a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular proficient in <hi>Machavels</hi> policy. <hi>Brutus</hi> was fatter than <hi>Cassius</hi>; but less dangerous. But our poor <hi>Mammet,</hi> as he depends upon the Basket, so he studies no <hi>Maxims</hi> of State. He proves that Axiom good,
<q>It is more miserable to have a stomach without meat, than to have meat without a stomach.</q>
Now his dogged Jaylor, according to his wonted humor, will tell you, that he fares as well as the rest, but he has a <hi>Caninum appetitum,</hi> which makes him eat more than he can digest. But believe no such Cheats; he could digest far more than he eats. But having long ago left his flesh; he is now bethinking himself to leave the world. That was a burden he did so little love, as he desired to leave; and now loath any longer to live: next to his sins, he repents himself of nothing more, but that He, who has held all his time for an upright Dealer, should now for want of flesh, become a Worm-cheater.</p>

<q>
                     <l>Didst thou but know, dogg'd Iaylor, whom thou hast</l>
                     <l>In those vast jaws of thy damp Prison plac't;</l>
                     <l>With cheerful rays thou'dst look upon thy guest,</l>
                     <l>And hold thy Mansion by his seizure blest.</l>
                     <l>Pure Nectar Rivolets drain'd from our brains</l>
                     <l>Like <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> shall eat through thy chains.</l>
                     <l>Grumble not, Island Curr! Here is a man</l>
                     <l>Would hook thy Nose, were't thou <hi>Leviathan.</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>Wits sleight restraint! our Spirits never felt</l>
                     <l>Cares of those keys hang dangling at thy belt.</l>

Thus this impaled <hi>Minotaur</hi> domineers within his own Grate; while looking about him, and observing his mean accommodation, he begins to take a more curious survey of his incurious Lodging; which he calls <hi>The Captains Cage</hi>; and with a Jaylors curse, in this sort he anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mizeth his despicable case.

It is great pity that his friends and fortunes should so neglect him; or his own meriting parts become such strangers to him, as he can neither finde the one to comfort, nor the other to support him. He concludes therefore, that it is a <hi>Mad world</hi>; and those that fawn on it, the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:102167:13"/>
maddest fools in it. He hears of Sallies, Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes, and Battels; but what are these to his Bolts? The report of the change of a Prisoner would enliven him far better. But <hi>Valour</hi> must not be redeemed with <hi>Copper.</hi> Though his Field-actions deserved Praise, yet must they not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase his person freedome without a Price. And poor <hi>restrained Cavalier,</hi> he's as far from <hi>giving</hi> as <hi>lending.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He remains dis-roab'd, and dis-arm'd: his one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shift then must be <hi>Best-be-trust,</hi> or he must stay there without Bayl. Others may be enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by <hi>Publique Faith,</hi> which he cannot. Well, this is his comfort, though he be restrain'd in body, he has deriv'd from his mind that liberty, as he can fight without Arms, and conquer his Passions in their highest extremity. Let him then dying, be honour'd with an Hearse, whose living valour was never rewarded worse. Nay, should his Body want the honour of a Shrine, yet let his Memory live in the Kalendar of Fame, while we indorse this Inscription upon his neglected Grave.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>OU are a Person of Descent; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble it with actions of Desert. There is nothing that detracts more from the splendour of an eminent Family, than to be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in that which may most and in the liveliest colours pourtray it self noble.</p>
               <p>The antient Roman Peerage became not onely distinguishable by their House or Coat, but by one peculiar virtue or other lineally descendent and inherent to that Race: As the <hi>Publicolae</hi> for Curtesy; the <hi>Scaevolae</hi> for Sobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; the <hi>Lentuli</hi> for Liberality; the <hi>Gracci</hi> for Gravity; the <hi>Appii</hi> for Equity; the <hi>Coriolani</hi> for Majesty; the <hi>Aureliani</hi> for Piety; and the <hi>Marii</hi>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:102167:16"/>
for Magnanimity. Which ornaments dignify'd them much more than all that blood which ran through their veins.</p>
               <p>I have been known to some persons equal to you in rank, and equipage of State, though dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent in their Extraction. For some of these were <hi>Born,</hi> others <hi>Made</hi> great. And in these may be found as great a difference in their Humour, as was in the lineal derivation or accidental constitution of their Honour. The one had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd a native freedome, such a genuine and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected comportment, as his very Carriage might play the Herauld, and deblazon his Linage. The other equally great, but his demean so levell'd that greatness, as it laid it flat, and mis-shap'd the person for acception of any such state. So as, it had been much better for that surreptitious Mushrom to have held still to his slow, but safe private growth; than by his undeserved rise to expose his pittifull grandeur to a scornfull cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
               <p>Some of these we have known, even in the flowrishingst States, who during their times of privacy, liv'd in fair repute; more lov'd than envy'd, though after swoln high, more envy'd than lov'd: and never less pitied, than when they stood in most need on't.</p>
               <p>These, likewise, in their first Entrance to State-Affairs, were accounted Grave and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential Men; and, in the opinion of those who
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:102167:16"/>
perused the Draught of their Actions, Passages and Debates, held most fitting to become great, before they came to be great.</p>
               <p>This was the opinion which most men had of <hi>Galba,</hi> whose unexpected Ascent to Honour, had so estrang'd him from his native humour, as he appeared not the same Man in Command, which he shewed himself to be when Commanded: And no doubt, but this change of disposition took it's origen from some sociable infection, by consorting with such, whose Applauses deluded him; and by their palpable Parasitism so mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him, as it made him forgetful of his Rise, and unmindful of his Fall.</p>
               <p>Whence I collect, that there is nothing that may improve, or disadvantage <hi>Greatness</hi> more, (whether it be derived from eminence of Life, or dignity of Place) than the <hi>Company</hi> which he frequents.</p>
               <p>It is an excellent <hi>Advice</hi> therefore of that <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Moral,</hi> in wishing us to make choice of such Companions, <q>in whose Society we have hope, either to better them, or be better'd by them.</q>
Stains are ever most discernible in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest Cloaths. Neither can <hi>Greatness</hi> in a Civil State become any subterfuge to <hi>Guiltiness:</hi> whence it was, that the <hi>Spartans</hi> held ever the <hi>Crime</hi> of a <hi>Peer</hi> most worthy of imparallel'd punishment. And hence it was, that their <hi>Great Men</hi> were call'd <hi>Optimates</hi>: Great, because Good. <hi>Peers,</hi>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:102167:17"/>
sayes that antient Sage, as they <hi>over-peer</hi> others in <hi>Greatness,</hi> so should they <hi>surmount</hi> others in <hi>Goodness</hi>; otherwise they build a Low <hi>Story</hi> upon an High <hi>Foundation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, as Ambition can find you no wings to mount up higher; so be it your care to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare you Arches to make your high-rais'd Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures appear stronger; let <hi>Amity</hi> be your best <hi>Monopoly,</hi> which is procur'd with least cost, and at best hand by debonair Carriage and Affabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Add to these, Acts of Piety; being sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably perform'd, they will incomparably be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come you.

imbroder them with Royal thoughts. It is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in thee, that has power to ennoble thee, and imbellish thy poverty with a rich and graceful Livery. But, methinks I see thee, like a poor Male-content, throwing thine Eyes abroad; as if thou sentst them forth as spyes, or scouts, to make a discovery of all the Estates of such Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons as confine, or neighbour near thee. And, what return do these envious Centinels render thee? In their Relations, I must no less freely than friendly tell thee, how infinitely they abuse thee: These suggest unto thee (and such <hi>Counsellors</hi> be the worst <hi>Consorts</hi>) that <hi>Nature</hi> has played the part of a niggardly and unjust Step-Dame with thee, in drawing in the Breasts of her Bounty towards thee and thy Relations; and so freely laying them open unto others. And is this all those <hi>Corrupt Agents</hi> can whisper to thee? Let me advise thee, lest thou become depraved before thou converse with Reason. A perswasive Enemy, under pretence of a pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liated Amity, may make his surprize of thee, and that with small difficulty, when he finds no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Force to resist his Fury. Admit thou wer't the poorest and contemptiblest wretch that ever breathed; born naked, and born to a naked Fortune: yet, for all this, thou canst not live so naked as thou wer't born. Thou wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedst then the strength of those active faculties which thou now enjoyest, appearing then so
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:102167:18"/>
helpless, as thou wantedst Native Supplies to help thy self. Tell me; what wantest thou in thy self, unless thou want the injoyment of thy self? And, what is it that deprives thee of this essential Liberty? I shall briefly inform thee in that, which may infinitly improve thee. There is a <hi>webb</hi> in thine <hi>eye</hi>; which attracts unto it the <hi>steam</hi> of <hi>Envy.</hi> This brings thee to expostu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late too arrogantly with thine own thoughts, and to over-value thy self in the Ballance of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive worth; above others whose Descent or Providence has rais'd them to more Wealth. Let not this grieve thee: these may harbour more needy and beggarly thoughts than thy self; unless Discontent have thrown thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thy self.</p>
               <p>It is the property of humane felicity, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve those who hugg it, in mazy and inextrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble precipices of misery. Forerunning times do not only afford us plenty of Tragical Examples: but if we look homeward, we shall find variety of such deplorable Objects and surviving Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidents of Our own. Such, who have tasted bitterly of this Wormwood-Lecture, and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly felt how the grandeur of <hi>Surreptitious Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> purchased more by the hand of Fate, than any visible act of Merit, has become destructive to the Safety of the Pursuer, and an inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Snare to the Enjoyer. For, having their wings once dipt in the <hi>Birdlime</hi> of <hi>Ambition</hi>;
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:102167:18"/>
the more they struggled with it, the more they were enwreathed by it. A serious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of our own Condition would perfect the Work; and fortifie his Resolves, who in the Eye of the World is most despicable, against all the insults and braves of Fortune: nay, make him such a Compleat Man, as his <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward contempt</hi> may beget in him an <hi>inward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</hi> The Way is short and easie; and not only so, but of a dayly presidential occurrency: there is no corner in any Street, nor walk in any Field, that will not afford thee a Receipt; the fault is thine, if thou make not <hi>Application</hi> for thy Cure. Thou art sick to see others whole: and in opinion most poor, when thou seest an other rich. This is a dangerous <hi>Eye-sore,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a soveraign <hi>Eye-salve.</hi> To have ones eye evil, because an other's good, is an Emblem of extremest envy. To bring thee then to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take more of <hi>Man</hi> than <hi>Sathan,</hi> for no fury more Satanical; wheresoever thou sojournest, look not upon the state nor style of the mighty; but on the shroud, and skrip of the needy. Not on the Highest, but on the Lowest: and then bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance thy condition with his. Peruse this Lect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure seriously, and it will highly improve thee.

               </p>
               <p>Of these I shall advise our <hi>young Masters,</hi> who, <hi>Lapwing</hi>-like, be newly crept out of the thin shell of their Guardianship, to carry their eyes about them, and by timely prevention di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert a surprize. It shall be your fortune some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to incounter such <hi>Counsel,</hi> as under shady and plausible pretences, seconded with Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Protests, will go along with you in the quest of your own fancy. These cunning Coy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducks are so well train'd in the Discipline of Youth, as they have got the Art of Diving, and in the next place of complying with any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour: and to mould themselves in all Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, to their temper. If <hi>Sensual,</hi> Sense is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly string they strike on. They will Chalk out a
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:102167:20"/>
way to this Prodigal Sensualist to compleat al his illimited desires, by satisfying all his <hi>Sense</hi> in the Epicureal injoyment of one Nights dalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: whereof a debaucht rioting <hi>Ranter,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Walls of this City not many years ago left to Posterity a fearful Example: bestowing on his <hi>five Senses</hi> on one Night, by the perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive suggestion of his vicious Consorts, <hi>five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds</hi>: Which profuse spending brought him to leap at a Crust before his dying. Thus did this lavish <hi>Landslord</hi> by his over-eager hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and hugging of his own Humour, not only detract from his Native Honour, but by his care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less course become the last of his House: Fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of his Estate, before his wings had rais'd his flight to half his age.</p>
               <p>But though <hi>Examples</hi> be held so moving, a they ever leave the deepest impression: yet <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Advice</hi> operates strongly upon the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, being rendred by a modest Pen, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out colour of Self interest; being the only <hi>Coloquintida</hi> that disrelisheth this Service; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it most suspected, where it should be most imployed.</p>
               <p>The safest and securest way then, that you can possibly walk in, is with a circumspect eye to reflect upon your own condition; and in no wise to suffer either the pravity of <hi>Counsel,</hi> nor corruption of <hi>Society</hi> to have that influence over you, as to mis-guide you, or make you
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:102167:20"/>
swell above your self; which many have done, and willingly perished under their own weight: and fatal is that Burden which crusheth down the Bearer. Let me then advise you (for your atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to it may be infinitly useful to you) not to magnifie your self in the Priority of your Place, nor Precedency of Command. Your <hi>Tenants</hi> be your <hi>Oeconomick Servants</hi>; play you the part of a discreet and temperate <hi>Master.</hi> Make them yours by the <hi>Cement</hi> of <hi>Love,</hi> not the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity</hi> of <hi>Law</hi>; for that were the way to <hi>crush</hi> them, rather than <hi>cherish</hi> them. They <hi>hold</hi> on you; <hi>uphold</hi> them who rely on you. It were very rare to see indigent <hi>Farmers</hi> to have a thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Landlord.</hi> Oppression is such a <hi>Ring-worm,</hi> as it spreads all over the <hi>face</hi> of his <hi>Estate,</hi> and blemisheth the beauty of it. If your desire be to live well and happily, let them live well and peaceably that are ranked under you. That Master either imprudently or parcimoniously manageth his Family, who suffers his Meniey to starve through penury. What is it, or whereto avails it to command <hi>Men</hi> without <hi>hearts?</hi> The way to gain their Affections, is to acquit them of Exactions. <hi>Affability</hi> is the Adamant to attract them; and <hi>Bounty</hi> the Balm to preserve them. Dead Flies spoil the sweetest Ointments: Breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less and feeble Offices in their <hi>Chief,</hi> beget dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esteem in his Relations.</p>

Your sole Management consists in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuring, Maturing and Cultivating your Ground: and accommodating your Grainge, the Seat of your Family, with all Accommodations suitable to a Person of your quality; concluding hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somely with the Poet:

                  <hi>V.</hi> Advice to a simple Countrey Curat.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am doubtful now whether I speak to a <hi>Mechanick,</hi> or a <hi>Scholar.</hi> If to the <hi>former,</hi> a good homely Homily is the highest pitch of his Divinity: which, having read Understanding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Distinctly, and Audibly; he rests confident that he has sufficiently perform'd a <hi>Curats</hi> duty. Small Tithes exact small Pains. These Places be for most part bestow'd on such, who remain desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of all Places: And like some poor maimed Hospitallers, become <hi>ravished</hi> with <hi>Devotion</hi>; not so much <hi>with it,</hi> as <hi>to it</hi>: being forc'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to rather through <hi>need</hi> than <hi>zeal.</hi> These, as they know not what metall <hi>Latin</hi> is made on: so their greatest study is (unless it be the Art of catching of <hi>Flyes</hi> with <hi>Domitian,</hi> or some other trifling pursute) to keep their <hi>shallow Sconces</hi> warm. Numerous Night-caps must secure them: for those Night Mounteroes reach to the highest purchase, unless it be a neighbourly-morning Noggin, which wheels about with much cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness: drilling along with no less freedom in frivolous impertinences.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Curat,</hi> as it is his least care to Teach; so is it in the lowest of his Fellows desires to be taught. <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Vse</hi> they never heard of:
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:102167:23"/>
and for <hi>Application,</hi> they know not what it means. Though this Countrey-Coridon Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat, never heard of a <hi>Peripatetick</hi> all his time, he resembles him much in his <hi>gradual-motion.</hi> For, he walks <hi>circularly,</hi> sits <hi>rarely</hi>; fearing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, it might bring him into an acquaintance with a <hi>Study</hi>; wherewith he has ever held di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, as an <hi>Enemy</hi> to his <hi>Health,</hi> and an <hi>unsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Guest</hi> to his <hi>House.</hi> Night-watchings, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending Studies, are held dangerous; but these are such strangers to him, as he has profest to all his penurious Family, that they shall never trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble his sleep: nor procure disquiet to his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Meneiy. Now, to acquaint the World, that he partakes of a <hi>Scribe</hi> (for his creeping thoughts fall many paces below a <hi>Pharise</hi>) his il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literate Girdle is constantly furnish'd with Pen and Inkhorn: which he usually imploys upon occasion (and with a glad welcom entertains he such occasions) of making <hi>Last Wills</hi> and <hi>Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>; whereof, though he retain some anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quated Presidents, he acts so illegally, and errs so egregiously, as his Pen occasioneth much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence: As many Lines; so many grounds of Sutes. Much like the <hi>Spanish Curat</hi>; who could set down large Legacies, but find no means, from whence those Legacies should arise. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual, Revenue of these Contingences, though they be but small: his hopes are, they will prove more permanent than <hi>Tithes.</hi> These have been
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:102167:24"/>
oft-times questioned, and whether legal or no, stoutly and strongly canvased: But his <hi>Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> never, unless by the <hi>Testators,</hi> and that concern'd not him.</p>
               <p>This unscholiastick <hi>Curat,</hi> as he never took breath from an <hi>Academy</hi>; So it is vehemently to be suspected, that he was some <hi>Mechanick Bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gler,</hi> before he was raised to the Degree of a <hi>Reader</hi>: which you shall easily discover by the Impression, or colourable Character of his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; which usually leaves the <hi>mark,</hi> or badge of his Profession, upon his Homily, or accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed place of his Reading. The Privilege of his Ignorance, being no Companion to late Studies, secures his Person from three notable inconveniences. For, in the first place, it is the least of his fears to lose his <hi>sight</hi> with too much Reading; or lose his <hi>wits</hi> with too long plod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; or be tax'd of maintaining either <hi>Scism</hi> or <hi>Heresie,</hi> by his subtilty in disputing. Besides these three <hi>Assurances,</hi> he has one advantage more above the Rank of his higher qualified Brethren: for, as his <hi>Patron</hi> needs not <hi>fear</hi> any <hi>Lapse,</hi> so his <hi>poor Clark</hi> stands in no fear at all of a <hi>Competitor</hi>: so bare is the <hi>Pasture</hi> as he's an hungry <hi>Pastor</hi> that would seek it: Yet were it sitting to help him, by way of <hi>Advice</hi>; though he need small assistance for gathering his <hi>Tithe.</hi> The Advice I shall give you, my <hi>Shallow Teacher,</hi> shall be this: You pretend to no Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:102167:24"/>
in the <hi>Pulpit</hi>; do not senselesly vapour it in the <hi>Alehouse</hi>: For a <hi>Puppy</hi> to act the part of a <hi>Rabby,</hi> were a daring fancy, or madding frenzy, which would admit no office in the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary.</p>
               <p>If you mean either to save your self or others by your Book; deliver nothing <hi>by</hi> the Book. <hi>Sow</hi> no <hi>Pillows</hi> under your <hi>Patrons Elbows.</hi> As you are taken for an <hi>ungifted</hi> and <hi>unordinated Man</hi>; be it your Gift; while others <hi>Preach,</hi> but will not say the <hi>Lords Prayer</hi>; to say the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> though you cannot <hi>Preach.</hi> Neither must you in this Trace the steps of that <hi>Timing Preacher,</hi> who to please the <hi>Lord of the Mannor,</hi> was perswaded to continue his <hi>Pater Noster,</hi> so long as his <hi>Patron</hi> continued his ten pound Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: which was an Action of <hi>Price,</hi> but no <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Be it your care to be of the number of those <hi>Ignorant Ones,</hi> who catch Heaven by their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Simplicity; rather than those <hi>Learned Ones,</hi> who purchase Hell by their too subtile Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E are now to give <hi>Advice</hi> to One, who, by <hi>vertue</hi> of his <hi>Place,</hi> if that vertue be not vitiated, nor the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minency of his Condition debased, might pretend justly to the Power of a <hi>Iudicial Monitor,</hi> in giving <hi>Advice</hi> unto others. But seeing how no <hi>Progress</hi> incounter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with more dangerous <hi>By-ways,</hi> than the <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit</hi> of <hi>Iustice</hi>; our design shall be this: First, to propose a <hi>Directory</hi> in the Course of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding; and in the second place, to caution him of some perillous Occurrences, which not declined, might ingage his <hi>repute</hi> to an irrepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble contempt, and his <hi>judgment</hi> to an apparent dis-esteem.</p>
               <p>Neither is it our meaning in this Draught to inlarge our Discourse, by defining, or dilating on the <hi>Office</hi> of <hi>Iustice:</hi> seeing there be more <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi> under that <hi>Notion</hi> published, and by that <hi>Title</hi> distinguished, than usefully observed, or practically administred.</p>
               <p>His <hi>Division</hi> was well approv'd, who, in his <hi>Itineray</hi> held, that the <hi>Duty</hi> of a <hi>Iustice</hi> wholly depended on these two particulars;
<list>
                     <item>1. Execution of Justice;</item>
                     <item>2. Exhibition of Mercy.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:102167:25"/>In the former, Consideration is to be had of the Quality of the Offender. Hope of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in a young bashful Transgressor, not only begs, but exacts remission: at least a mitigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Punishment, in comparison of an antient Offender, whose habitual misdemeanure has made him a stranger to Hope, and a Decoy to the follies of our Time.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Distinction</hi> requires great <hi>Discretion</hi> in a <hi>Countrey Iustice:</hi> Let me then advise him, for his better avoiding of a more dangerous preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice, to cloath his countenance sometimes with a cheerful aspect, and shew a mild spirit to a penitent Peccant. Let him act the indulgent <hi>Barnabas,</hi> rather than a severe <hi>Bonarges.</hi> No Son of <hi>thunder</hi>; but of a calm and compassio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate <hi>temper</hi>: Especially, where dispositions ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear farr apter to be won by mildness, than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd by roughness: For, these menacing and violent Reclaimings, do generally <hi>harden,</hi> rather than <hi>soften</hi> an indulgent and ingenuous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>I have sometimes heard of a fiery-furious <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,</hi> who usually breathed nothing but <hi>Whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping</hi> and <hi>Commitment</hi>; and from the Authority of his Place, publickly protested before the face of the Countrey,
<q>That if he might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed any long time to sit on that Bench, he would so secure the Countrey from Felony, as a Bush should keep a Sheep; </q>Yet, that very
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:102167:26"/>
night, was an Ambush lay'd for this severe <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices</hi> Horse, and stoln out o'th' Pasture.</p>
               <p>Whence we conclude with that Excellent Moral,
<q>That Justice mixt with Mercy wins most <hi>hearts,</hi> and reclaims <hi>vice</hi> best.</q>
                  <hi>Draco</hi>'s Laws being writ in <hi>blood,</hi> dispatcht more than they reform'd. Yet shall I ever firmly adhere to that Position:
<q>That too much indulgence shown to the Evil, redounds ever to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of the Good.</q>
               </p>
               <p>There be three fearful <hi>Eye-sores</hi> which dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Light, and blemish the Sight of <hi>Iustice.</hi> Amity, Enmity, base Lucre, by prostituting Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice as a Mercenary Commodity. This caus'd the <hi>Athenians</hi> to Emblematize <hi>Iustice</hi> with <hi>Blind Eyes,</hi> and <hi>Lame Hands.</hi> Blind, that She might not distinguish Persons: Lame, that She might not receive Bribes. Whence our <hi>Countrey Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice</hi> may collect, how derogatory those Noble Assertors held it to be to their Profession, to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Justice for <hi>Reward</hi>; much more to divide Stakes, or admit of <hi>Sharing</hi> with their <hi>Puny Clarks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to compleat him; that he may appear not only a <hi>Reader</hi> of <hi>Statutes</hi> at <hi>Large,</hi> but an approv'd Practiser of what he Professeth, we shall present to him such a President, whose Example, if he imitate to life, he shall need no other <hi>advice</hi> to direct him, no other line to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate him. His resolution in the course of his
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:102167:26"/>
Profession was this:
<q>I have offred my Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice on the Altar of <hi>Themis</hi>: and I mean to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form what I have already profest. Mine Ear shall be open to the Orphans Cause; mine Hand ready to wipe off the Widdows Tear. Active shall every Faculty be to promote Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, remove Injuries, and to render every one his due.</q>
Observe this exactly, and you shall acquit your self, not only a <hi>Iustice,</hi> but a <hi>Patriot</hi> of your Countrey.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Ere am I to bestow my <hi>Advice</hi> on an <hi>Heir</hi>; or a <hi>Thing</hi> that partakes more of <hi>Ayr</hi> than any other <hi>substance</hi>: Yet furnish'd with sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance more than enough to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue feathers in the Ayr. Give me leave now, after the long-wish'd departure of your Father, to offer to you some Directions, which the <hi>heat</hi> and <hi>height</hi> of your vast hopes would never till now afford you time to consider.</p>
               <p>Now, in your Entrance into the World, this gorgeous Theatre of humane glory; where, if you please, you may act the part of the <hi>Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Son,</hi> without hope of returning to your Father: I should advise you to take special
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:102167:27"/>
care of your inward cure. You think all is well with you: and from thence ariseth your great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est danger. A disease insensible, is ever most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable. Youth is a malady of it self, till it be purged of those malignant humours which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prave it: and strengthned with such Soveraign Receipts as may preserve it. But, to no condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is youth more troublesome than to his, who is advanced to fortunes. Every Place to him is a Snare. No object of Beauty, but an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive Lure to Fancy: and an Ingredience to a Frenzy. Various faces beget in him distracted affections. Privacy and Retirement breeds in his troubled thoughts sundry discontents. He understands his Pupillage to be past, and that hee's become his own Guardian: which makes his <hi>Cinque Ports</hi> so weakly guarded. For Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance he needs not hunt after them; the report of his over-swoln fortunes playes the <hi>Coy,</hi> and brings them in Sholes to his Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house: And these angle cunningly after his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour. They will oppose him in nothing that may delight him. He must be their <hi>Prince</hi> so long as his Conduit flowes: the decrease where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he either mindes not, or disvalues. Thus is this <hi>Paphlagonian Partridge</hi> no sooner sprung, than catch't in every Springe.</p>
               <p>Yet though he has lost himself, we intend not to lose him; so long as there appears the least hope of retriving him, or any probable means
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:102167:27"/>
of recovering him. Let us then apply a timely cure to this violent distemper.</p>
               <p>I shall not wonder much at his boundless ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence; it hath been ever observed, that a great Scatterer is the usual Successour of a great Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herer. We may imagin that this <hi>young Heir</hi> had such a <hi>Providor,</hi> as he left him a Nest well feathred, before he adventur'd to flicker in the World. All was got to his hand; which made him more ready to spend, what never troubled his sleep to get, nor wrought upon his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to keep. He has heard, perchance, his <hi>Father</hi> say, that he had taken more delight in Sparing, than ever his <hi>Heir</hi> could do in Spend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And to make an Experiment of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Observation, he meant to take a Tryal in this <hi>Seed-fur</hi> of his fortunes. Now, what is all this but a <hi>Career</hi> of <hi>Youth</hi>; an Excursion so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar, as it growes quite expung'd out of the Catalogue of Serious Errors? yet some <hi>Receipts</hi> must be us'd, lest too much indulgence abuse his youth.</p>
               <p>Go to then, <hi>Wilde-Oats,</hi> we must of necessity deal a little roughly with you: We are to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn you a restraint. And <hi>Confinement</hi> being so <hi>Common</hi> a <hi>Censure,</hi> cannot abridge much the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sute of your pleasure. Retain that <hi>Maxim,</hi> for it holds infallible:
<q>One Months liberty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praves Youth more, than a whole Years disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline will reform.</q>
The benefit of Retirement,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:102167:28"/>
and recess from Society, we shall not need to press much, variety of Instances may illustrate it. Grave and Reverend Patriots have we had here within our <hi>Pale,</hi> whose Native dispositions moulded them <hi>Libertines</hi>; but by a prudent co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercion of their straying affections, they became high improvers of their Knowledg; and in the end, such expert <hi>State-Pilots,</hi> as they were held fitting to <hi>sit</hi> at the <hi>Stern</hi> of the <hi>State.</hi> This it is, at retired hours to <hi>read men</hi>; not such as the freedom of folly has acquainted you withall; for those were attractive Lures to train you to lightness: and expose your malleable nature to all loosness. The Perusal of those whom I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend to your choice, will season your youth so maturely, as folly shall become a stranger to your fancy: All Extravagancy a Reformade in your family. This will make you an <hi>Heir</hi> of fame, as well as fortune. Hold such an even poize in the management of your Estate, as you may constantly observe this Rule:
<q>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to spend, where honest frugality bids you spare: nor spare, where reputation bids you spend.</q>
This shall render you discreetly gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in both.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ature hath brought you the later into the World, not to your dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage, but improvement.</p>
               <p>He only appears seated above the World, who intermedleth least with the World. He only has the Earth at his command, who sphears his divine thoughts above the command of Earth. Your fortunes have exempted you from too much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrance with these Inferiours: and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently inlarged your affections to those Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour.</p>
               <p>From a Survey of your <hi>Extraction,</hi> you find your self behind your <hi>Brother</hi> in nothing but time. And this redounds highly too, to your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. For it is observed in <hi>Births,</hi> as well as <hi>Plants,</hi> that the later growths render the matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest and fullest fruits. You know your self to be a Cyen of the same Stock and Mould, and generally of a more purely-refin'd and rarifi'd Minde: (without vanity or arrogance in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to your quality be it spoken) if the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of your own disposition, or some other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant effects, impede not the proficience of those <hi>Innate Seeds</hi> originally sown in you.</p>
               <p>Those Privileges and Indowments given you
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:102167:29"/>
by Nature, to parallel the Revenues of your <hi>Elder Brother,</hi> are rich and exquisite. Pregnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Wit; Promptness in Conceipt; Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Apprehension; and Happiness of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory in reteining. These <hi>abilities</hi> be generally intailed on you, to supply other temporary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, which the <hi>Poet</hi> handsomly glanced at, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
<q>
                     <l>Nature by secret influence held it fit,</l>
                     <l>That th' <hi>younger Brood</hi> should have the <hi>elder Wit.</hi>
                     </l>
                  </q>
What dishonour then were it unto you to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>base, or debauch those Native Parts, so richly imbellished, either by the foyl of worthless <hi>Society,</hi> or by an ungenerous <hi>Education,</hi> which is a <hi>Second Nature,</hi> and usually corrupts the <hi>Spring-head</hi> with some impure mixture? Our <hi>Calidonian</hi> Neighbour is to be commended in this (and really in little else;) where, if he be a qualified Person, he will not suffer his <hi>younger Sons</hi> to nestle long under their Mothers Wings; but sends them abroad to be Educated: and consequently by Language, Discourse and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage so inabled, as their <hi>Demean</hi> appears graceful, their <hi>Society</hi> grateful in all their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses. Which Improvement, by help of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation (if we may believe ingenuous <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clay</hi>) raiseth it self to a <hi>Story higher</hi> in his <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,</hi> than any other Nation in <hi>Europe</hi>: which
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:102167:29"/>
he attributes to the apprehensive capacity, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation and confidence of his own Natives, in these words: For Education of their young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re Sons, the Nobility and Gentry of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey are praise-worthy; for, in stead of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors</hi> at home, it is their care to furnish them with <hi>Manners</hi> abroad. No convenient cost is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred them, nor divertisement admitted them, that may any way obstruct their proficiency. Wherein their Native ingenuity, furthered by an industrious docility, acts so happily;
<q>As, what Studies soever they encline to, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper in them with wonderfull success. None are more patient of Military duties, nor more valiant in Fight, <hi>being led on by confident Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi> Nor do the Muses ever appear more beautifull, than when they inspire the breasts of <note n="*" place="bottom">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>But those that travel, or rather wander in a poor fashion, and rely upon no other meanes, than going to the Houses of their Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, which are grown rich in other Lands; and demand, as it were, the tribute of their Countrey, as they partake not of that <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Rank,</hi> so are they most intollerable in their proud beggery.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But there is nothing wherein they deserve

more praise, than in their providing so for the <hi>younger,</hi> as they shall never need to be <hi>pinn'd</hi> on the <hi>sleeve</hi> of the <hi>Elder.</hi> A great fault in our <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Gentry,</hi> who usually make their <hi>younger Sons</hi> their <hi>elder Brothers Falconers</hi>: or expose them to such desperate fortunes, and withall so incapable of any serviceable imployment, as for want of a better way, they oftimes make the <hi>High-Way</hi> their Calling. Be it your principal care then, <hi>hopeful Sir,</hi> (for so must I hold you, till <hi>vanity</hi> lose my <hi>hopes</hi> in you) that as by course of Nature through your <hi>Minority,</hi> there is left to you less, so by your pious industry you would improve it more.

much upon the vanity of your <hi>Habit</hi>; for that may suit with the levity of our time: as that Epidemical Habit of <hi>Vice</hi> sufficiently discovered in your fruitless expence of time. Shall we trace your Steps from Morn to Night? we shall find in your Wals and By-wayes a continued Night. The first <hi>Idol</hi> you adore is your <hi>Glass</hi>; wherein you court <hi>your self</hi> in such an accurate mean, as if <hi>Narcissus</hi> were reviv'd, and presented there, purposely to admire his own shadow. What a tricking and trimming, purfling and poudring, painting and perfuming bestow you on the <hi>Case,</hi> while you neglect the <hi>Instrument!</hi> which adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate daubing makes Nature appear a stranger to her self. And whereto tends all this? Truth is, I may safely conclude with that serious <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Diog. Cyn.</hi>
                  </note> Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick:
<q>If it be done for your self, it is mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: and if for another, it is sin.</q>
By this time we are to imagin you compleatly accoutred for the visit of your Ladies chamber; which to your honour, flies quickly open, to give the freer ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance to your amorous encounter. Present access promiseth no less prosperous success: which, though it be sometimes in your thoughts to expedite to your advantage; yet falling doubtful in your resolves, whether to suit her for a <hi>Wife,</hi> or a <hi>Mistriss,</hi> you grow cooler in your pursuit, than you were in the beginning. This troubles you more, than the recollection
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:102167:31"/>
of your mis-spent hours. Let me draw near you; what do you pitch upon in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test? Have you weigh'd her? Is she too light for a Wife: and too cunning for a Mistriss? Leave her, before your thoughts be too impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively fixed on her: lest she, indeed, play the <hi>Mistriss,</hi> and become your <hi>Commandress. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides</hi> was as strong as you; and <hi>Omphale</hi> made him her slave. So imperious is licentious Love.</p>
               <p>But, having taken leave of your <hi>Love-sick</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy (who at least pretends so) with promise of an evening visit; your next Address must be to the <hi>Ordinary</hi>; where you incounter with more variety of dishes to give relish to your lusci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous appetite; than any useful discourse to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove your knowledg. Nay, should occasion be offer'd, (as there will be some ever who take care to satisfie their <hi>Brains</hi> as well as their <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies</hi>) of helps that way; your <hi>Conceipt,</hi> by run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a wool-gathering after lighter fancies, sends you away as <hi>empty</hi> as you came. Gaming, Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis, Baloun, Bilyard, with other light dalliance, have so forestall'd your unsetled judgment, as they will give no free admittance to the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene of any Serious Discourse. Neither could any thing more be expected from you; seeing the <hi>Principles</hi> of those who had the greatest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on you, and nearest interest in you, could make you no dangerous person for <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs</hi>: nor accurate for matter of <hi>Discourse,</hi>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:102167:31"/>
Your Mercer, Milliner, Taylor, and Perfumer, though they made you a neat <hi>Outward Man,</hi> they could not with all their Art so compleat you, as to present you <hi>Inwardly</hi> suitable to an Intelligible Company. It is your Ambition too, frequently to visit the Court; whereto usually you no sooner come, than you are pitifully caught. Court-Baits are cunningly laid: and your youthful eyes cannot discover them, till you are taken in them. Masks, Presentments, Revels, and Reer-Bankets, have been in our calmer times, attractive Lures to gallant Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies: which once set on fire, were not quickly quench't.</p>
               <p>There is one thing likewise, that you have been much noted for, in your very <hi>gate</hi>:
<q>None who past by you, could do you a greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury than not to observe you.</q>
Such was your conceipt, that a gallant Posture could attract no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing less than the Eye of an Admirer. But this is such an easie error, as humane frailty weav's it's Apology. Your thoughts in this aim at no more than a debonair regreet: And, that Man is well bought, who costs but a Salutation.</p>
               <p>As the <hi>Cinamon-Tree</hi> may be your emblem, whose <hi>Bark</hi> is better than the <hi>Body</hi>; so may you expect justly for most honour to be done to that part, which your esteem holds most worthy.</p>
               <p>Thus Sir, have you heard your distemper:
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:102167:32"/>
and the way to <hi>cure</hi> you, is to <hi>wound</hi> you. No Sin-salve without sense of Sin. <hi>Corrosives</hi> must be used, before <hi>Cordials</hi> be applyed. You are to be launced, before the Cicatrice be closed. Your wilde affections spread so broad, they must be pruned. Your <hi>Ancestors</hi> have left you a vast Estate: this should not make you a <hi>Libertine</hi>; but Liberal to those that be indigent. Would you be call'd a <hi>Gallant</hi>? let your gallant acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons proclaim you worthy of that Style. He who goes forth to see a Man <hi>aray'd</hi> in <hi>soft Raiment,</hi> disparageth his Judgment, in preferring the <hi>Cabinet</hi> before the <hi>Iewel</hi> inclosed in it.</p>

               <p>But, make search through every Coast, Creek and Corner of his <hi>Platonick Commonweal</hi>; and find me one passage in it, that authorizeth you, my lovely <hi>Mistriss,</hi> being Married, to entertain any Platonick, or affectionate Confident.

Let us then di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert our Course from Him, and make our Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to his Client; who with a <hi>potent Purse</hi> labours to support an <hi>impotent Cause.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our <hi>Advice</hi> to this litigious Agent then shall be this: that he be cautious in the fulness of his Fortunes, of such Pursutes. Admit, he proceed, and by the assistance of a Cramm'd Purse, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperously succeed; that Success will prove a Canker: for, by injoying of what which is not his own, he shall ruine that which is his own; and make his Posterity suffer, through his scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous usage of so injurious a Possessor. Many Rich Fathers have by this means made their <hi>Heirs</hi> die <hi>Beggers.</hi> A Predecessors care avails no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, unless it be seconded by a Superiour Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.</p>
               <p>Our <hi>Advice</hi> to Persons of Quality, whose Descents and Estates have enstyl'd them eminent in their Countrey, shall cloze in this. Let their <hi>Breeding</hi> be a Signal Evidence of the Family from whence they came. Education is the best Cognizance of an antient Extraction. None can gather from what we wear, what we are,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:102167:35"/>
or what we were. It is our language and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mean that deblazon us best. Metall upon Metall is false Heraldry: and so be all garish imbellishments to the real Constitution of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
               <p>We might observe even in these later times, wherein Persons of Rank and Quality are to be compleatly accoutred to the refinement of this Age wherein they live; how much they preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice those Native Abilities wherewith they were at first indowed; as likewise that Splendor of an Antient Family, from whence they des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended; by being left to themselves, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowing the first-fruits of their time, those prime Flowers of their Youth (wherein the choisest and generoust Seeds are not only sown, but spring to their best proficience;) upon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucht Societies and unbred Consorts much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low themselves. Their acquaintance with a <hi>Countrey Can,</hi> quickned with the pleasing Title of a <hi>Brave Lord,</hi> or a <hi>Gallant young-Master,</hi> madds them above measure. Whereas, if they fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented Company suitable to their quality, they might find with less expence, and more use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful experience, what would best become them both in Places of Pleasure and Judicature.</p>
               <p>Now to propose them to whom we direct our Polemical Discourse, Places of Improvement; as <hi>Vniversities</hi> are fittest for laying the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; So <hi>Inns of Courts</hi> be the properest for Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Mean and Deportment.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:102167:36"/>The one for <hi>grounding,</hi> the other for <hi>matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Scholastical Breeding, if it rise no higher, may be accounted Pedantical; but being compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Conference, and choice Conversation, it becomes graceful.</p>
               <p>There was nothing that could move <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critus</hi> to more vehement laughter, than to hear the amorous discourse of a Stoical Scholar. His Passion was presented with such unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expressions, as if <hi>Pallas</hi> had been his <hi>Venus,</hi> or <hi>Minerva</hi> his <hi>Mistriss.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For <hi>Travel,</hi> it is such an Ornament to Gentry, as it affords in Table-treats a voluble tongue; whereas a want of it begets silence: unless <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance</hi> assume to it self so much <hi>confidence</hi> as to discourse of what it knows not; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently discover want of Sense, without ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of shame.</p>
               <p>An intelligent Traveller is the Expeditest <hi>Mathematician</hi>; for he carries his <hi>Globe</hi> alwayes about him. But some we have, who no sooner lose the sight of their Countrey, than they lose themselves. These learn Forein Fashions, but never how to fashion themselves. They retein the <hi>Garb,</hi> but not the essential <hi>Grace</hi> of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel.</p>
               <p>But set these Shools of <hi>Learning, Law</hi> and <hi>Travel</hi> aside; if our <hi>Gentry</hi> have a thought of improving their knowledg at home (for all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions

               <p>In which Allay, if your discretion make you so happy, as to entertain into your intimacy the best: such I mean, as may rather improve you, than delude you, and by their subtile impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures, usually practised by our late <hi>Trap'nners,</hi> surprize you. From which prudent Election, in relation to Society, you shall reap this benefit: it will so clearly distinguish your quality, and in your <hi>better parts</hi> so exquisitly accommodate you, that not one hour shall pass by you, which may not highly redound to your advantage. Such Acquaintance will beget in you no Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. It will appear by your <hi>demean,</hi> that you have read <hi>men</hi>; the usefull'st knowledg for a Gentleman. Books are excellent means to steal away hours; but serious Consorts render you the best <hi>Illustrations</hi> on them: These return <hi>Spectacles</hi> for all <hi>Sights.</hi> Representing more <hi>true Lights</hi> than all our <hi>New Lights</hi> can render. <note n="*" place="bottom">Communicable knowledg the fittingst <hi>Chair-Man</hi> in publick Societies and private Families.</note> For these effuse no deceiving, but an intellective splendor, operating strongly upon the faculties

of the Soul; and dilating their effects, not onely to the direction of themselves, but instruction of others.</p>
               <p>There is an observable Error in this Nation, (which we could wish were a stranger to it;) Many of our <hi>Pen-feathred youngsters</hi> be no sooner mounted to their Fathers Saddles, than they become eagre hunters after <hi>Good-fellows</hi>: and to ingratiate them the more, will make them rather their <hi>Pensioners,</hi> than lose the benefit of their unnecessary Acquaintance. Their only care is, with the <hi>Cumin</hi> of their inconsiderate bounty to lure those <hi>Wild Pigeons</hi> to their Coat. Too fruitless a Charge to bestow on such a Covy.</p>
               <p>It were easie to make a Dish of Meat worth a <hi>groat,</hi> at a crowns expence; or to use that strict <hi>Laconian</hi> adage:
<q>It is an hard purchase to gain a Friend with the Sale of a Farm.</q>
We shall conclude him then to have forfeited his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who in his pursute of Friends or Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, entertains such a Choice as may admit a Change.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Bushell</hi> of <hi>Salt</hi> antiently was held a Measure little enough to <hi>Season</hi> Acquaintance: It were too rash confidence then to make a Companion at first sight his Secretary, or Bosome Friend. This hath been the ruine of many. Persons of all conditions may experimentally instance it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:102167:37"/>Now for those who are cry'd up for the Wits of the time; we would advise them to be well known to those with whom they converse face<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously, or vent their Conceipts.</p>
               <p>Of all Creatures, none more dangerous than <hi>Satyrs</hi>: who, while they <hi>brush</hi> great Mens Cloaths, they fearfully trench upon their own safety, by exposing their freedom to the various construction of the Company. Some there be, who would rather lose their <hi>Friend</hi> than their <hi>Iest.</hi> But such Conceipts cost too dear. These had need of many Friends, or their Wits will <hi>protest</hi> against them, and return them <hi>Bankrupts.</hi> It is the infelicity of some petulant wits to bring their Owners Heads under the Hearers Girdle, by their indiscreet Flashes. To be merry and wise is a good Rule; but many through intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, or too much confidence, usually trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress that bound.</p>
               <p>That Sage Precept deserves your remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance:
<q>Be Stoical to none; affable to all; but open thy breast to few.</q>
               </p>
               <p>By which means, he may sleep without fear, and awake without affront.</p>
               <p>Of such we may justly conclude, that they have attained to an happy Period in their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress; who can look upon the World with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and entertain their Condition with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. These can fix the eye of their Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation with a cheerful aspect upon <hi>Heaven,</hi> as
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:102167:38"/>
their only <hi>Land-mark.</hi> Whatsoever is below them, they hold them such contemptible Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, as they deserve not their Enterview. These know how to put in practice that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <hi>Advice,</hi> in <hi>shutting</hi> up the <hi>Windows,</hi> that their <hi>House</hi> may <hi>Shine.</hi> Their <hi>Eyes,</hi> those <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows</hi> of the <hi>Body</hi> must not be imployed in any Office that may unbecome them. Nor any other <hi>Sense</hi> in that which may detract from <hi>her</hi> honour that commands them. Such a Regiment cannot chuse but atchieve brave acts, wheresoever inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</p>
               <p>It is an infallible Maxim, that he who lives so as every day were his last, must necessarily take his leave of the World without a Sigh: and entertain the Summons of Death with a Smile.</p>
               <p>The Consequence holds, that <hi>he</hi> who sets his rest upon the Place of true rest, neglects not his Work, but makes Spiritual Labour his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy to eternal rest: Such a Work-man is no <hi>Idler</hi> in the <hi>Market-place</hi>; but at the first hour of the day goes down into the <hi>Vineyard</hi>: and having cheerfully performed the Course of his imployment, he makes the Evening his dayes Accomptant: closing his nightly return with this useful question: <hi>O my Soul, what hast thou done this day?</hi> A mind so Devotionally exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, makes the Natural Sun his Spiritual Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem: The Sun, as it shines brighter at its set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, than its rising; so the splendor of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:102167:38"/>
Life appears Clearest at his End<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>There is nothing more inglorious to Age, than for an Old Man to have no other Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prove his years, than his Gray Hairs. Like an <hi>Almanack</hi> out of date; a neglected Address, or a defac'd Record, he appears in every Conference, or Passage of Consequence. Though his many mis-spent years have made him an <hi>Elder</hi> in the <hi>Ward</hi> where he lives: and the <hi>Revestry</hi> admit him a voice in the Election of a <hi>Lecturer</hi>; others, less <hi>old,</hi> but more <hi>ripe,</hi> sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the number; while he is left to himself with leasure enough to wipe his reverend beard, and content his weak sense with the place of a Cipher.</p>
               <p>These would make rare <hi>Elders</hi> for deciding <hi>Doctrinal Controversies</hi>: or Stating <hi>Cases</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</hi> What numerous emergent Errors have we known to have been broached from the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> of such pretending <hi>Rabbies</hi>; whose reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend esteem lay only in the Colour of their Hair? Such advantage had Time given them, as their years authorized them with an ignorant confidence to set up, what the succession of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years could not pull down.</p>
               <p>Hence it was, that one of our <hi>Modern States-Men,</hi> from his long Experience in sitting at the Stern of the State, wisely concluded,
<q>That he never knew any <hi>Constitutions</hi> all his time more
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:102167:39"/>
inconsistent with a Politick State, than those which came from a Gray Head, and a Green Brain. A face of gravity made them appear what they were not; but a clear judgment would present them in their own shape, and discover to the World what they were.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In Arguments of Discourse, the recollection of our own thoughts, assisted by the <hi>observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of others, is the only way to gain Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>He that loves to hear himself talk, seldom im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves his Knowledg.</p>
               <p>Many by too much talk have lost themselves; few or none by silence.</p>

                  <hi>Harpocrates</hi> with his <hi>finger</hi> on his <hi>Mouth</hi> was held the <hi>Wisest Sign</hi> in <hi>Athens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That <hi>Spartan</hi> Sage seriously observing how one sufficiently ripe in years, spake like a young Man:
<q>I should have adjudged you (said he) worthy to sit in the Highest Place, till I heard you speak; but your tongue has dishonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red your age: come then down, and give that <hi>young Man</hi> room, whose downy Chin pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends more to age in his express, than you to Sense, with all your aged Experience.</q>

But those many Scisms and Divisions among themselves, may save me that labour. Be it their Task to Preach both by <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Work</hi>: that, what their tongue speaks to others, their exemplary life may Preach to themselves and others.

               <p>It was my fortune, in my younger years, to be
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:102167:41"/>
known to one of these <hi>Shallops</hi>; a Person of a strong-pretending design, but weak dispatch.

It hapned one day, that this obsequious Agent, who usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bestowed many dayes to small purpose, was nominated a <hi>Commissioner</hi> in a business of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, and distance to the place of his dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: which quickned his morning awake for his more seasonable attendance. Yet, in his way, resolving to call on his Neighbour, a down-right Boor, and never acquainted with such imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; <hi>Are you asleep,</hi> said this wise Arbitrator, <hi>that all things are so husht and quiet about you?

Those who over-doe the work, generally in affairs of this nature, pull down more than they set up: and by their <hi>Superstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture</hi> give their Adversary ground for erecting a <hi>Story</hi> higher than he intended: or upon the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of such a foundation he could have proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly expected.</p>

               <p>Good Causes stand in need of wiser Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners, or they will in a Terme or two dwindle to nothing; and shape the Plaintiffs Suit to the neglected habit of a <hi>Forma Pauperis:</hi> and so leave him like <hi>Plato</hi>'s naked Man, with two feet, but without feathers.

               <p>We are now to return you the character of a Spirit more genuine, and of a stronger temper.

Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty Vessels send forth ever the shrillest sound: whereas deepest Foords stream a-long with the calmest course. And experimentally shall that Man find this <hi>close Politician,</hi> who takes occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to imploy him, no less full of <hi>danger,</hi> than he is of <hi>depth.</hi> He has a <hi>self-interest</hi> in every <hi>Commission:</hi> and can angle cunningly in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled waters: and to display him in his native colour, <hi>Reward</hi> holds such influence over him, as it has power to over-byas him; by tracing the steps of <hi>Coelius,</hi> who pleaded best with his <hi>left hand.</hi>

               <p>It was sometimes disputable, whether it were better for one, in a Case of Judicature, to make choice of an Agent, who would betray his Cause through simplicity; or of such an one, who would make a prey of him by his subtilty. Neither of them is good; but the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this intricate question closeth in this: whether it were easier to digest (though they be both meats of hard concoction) <hi>suffering</hi> under an apparent <hi>foe,</hi> or a pretending <hi>friend</hi>? Thus have we found you <hi>two Commissioners,</hi> both appearing, but neither worthy approving. For, as the one might by his <hi>ingenuous simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> betray your Cause, wherein he is interessed: So might the other, by his <hi>partial-gilt subtilty,</hi> expose your credulity to prejudice, where you least suspected. To decline these precipices, no course clearer nor safer, than to make choice of such, whom your own assiduate experience, or repute of the Countrey wherein they live, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:102167:43"/>
you sufficiently, both of their <hi>honesty</hi> and <hi>knowledg.</hi> And distinct notions you may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily find in these, whether they in that qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, merit your approvement or no. For, if <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest,</hi> they will return you that Answer which that antient Sage gave to his Son-in-Law, in a case of like nature:
<q>I am yours in just Causes onely.</q>
Neither will these <hi>Commissioners</hi> (pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposing them honest) make it their onely work to sit upon <hi>Examination</hi> of <hi>Witnesses</hi> (though of principal concern to their office) but to address Proposals of Peace; and pursue those Motions with that discreet moderation, as it may produce effect, unless the <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,</hi> usually reigning in litigious Plaintiffs, obstruct it: It is a grounded Maxim, that the best <hi>Commissioners</hi> be the effectuall'st <hi>Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers.</hi> They erect a <hi>Chancery</hi> within themselves, and conscientiously compose the quarrel.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Knowledg,</hi> being the <hi>second requisite</hi>; Practical Experience is the best Directory; chalking him forth the way wherein he is to walk; which accompanied with <hi>Integrity,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleats the Work.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>S an <hi>High-Flyer</hi>; hatcht in an airly Ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; apt to mount before he find wings; bred to the disquiet of all, but most to himself. For the Triumphs of <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiades</hi> will not suffer <hi>Themistocles</hi> to sleep. He is all <hi>quick-silver,</hi> and in his career, of such a <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual motion</hi>; as <hi>Phaeton</hi>-like, he gallops over the <hi>twelve Signs</hi> in a moment: but resolves his ayry grandure like a <hi>Squib,</hi> with the present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a <hi>Flash,</hi> to nothing. <note n="*" place="bottom">Ambition, saith wise <hi>Montpellier,</hi> though it have a strong Constitution, it has a squeamish Stomack.</note>Having left the <hi>Countrey,</hi> breathing too foggy vapours for his queazy stomack, his resolves hold for traversing the <hi>Court</hi>: where he takes notice of an early <hi>State-Favourite,</hi> who by his <hi>timely rising</hi> had out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run him: but he means, if his designs fail him not, to win ground on him, and out-strip him too; by fishing so artfully with his golden hook, and strength of assisting Relations.</p>
               <p>He has so much wit as to humour the Times: and to attempt with a conscientious indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy whatsoever may advance his own interest. But for as much as one must <hi>creep</hi> before he <hi>go</hi>; he treads the <hi>Pallace-yard</hi> at first gingerly; talks demurely: and in every Posture composeth his counterfeat garb to that gravity, as if <hi>Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:102167:44"/>
were his <hi>Alien,</hi> and <hi>Stoicall Civility</hi> his Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. But, finding the way of being great is to become popular; he makes it his onely work to ingratiate himself first with the Pedantry: and by their applause, easily acquir'd by a gracefull aspect, and arguments of bounty, to mount one story higher. Hot Embers cannot lye long ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked up in ashes, some sparks will break forth, and discover their confined heat. Suppose him then entring the <hi>Lobby</hi>; where he acquaints him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with some necessary <hi>Appendices</hi> to the Court; laying his Project, how by their means he may raise his infant hopes to their intended height. And it falls out seasonably; for by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct he makes way for his future preferment.</p>
               <p>In the mean time he moves slowly. Weak wings impt with such slender helps cannot promise any speedy nor successive flight: He must not then rest here. Neither can he expect by his early rise to find any firm footing. He has read of <hi>Mazarella</hi>'s fate; and by his example, loth would he be, that his fore-noon honour should be crush'd down by an after-noon fall: or suffer his infant-Glory to set in a Cloud. But his attentive Ears open to all reports that may any way conduce to his advantage; no less op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunately than fortunately hear of a late-mounted Lord, highly advanced, but meanly gifted. One, who by his immerited growth, having over-swoln himself, makes an Idol of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:102167:44"/>
his Titular Honour. Yet this self-conceipted <hi>Pharisee</hi> stands in needs of a <hi>Scribe,</hi> to supply his defects; having nothing to subscribe him great, saving an illegible mould of dis-joynted Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; which presents a name above the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of a Reader. This Place, though far below his aims, this fresh-water Courtier ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts: and within few Months, by his dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Pen, and the Grace his insinuation has got, he becomes too big for his Place: and what might be wondred at, <hi>Competitor</hi> to his Master: whom he oft-times out-strips, leaving him as bare in <hi>esteem</hi> as he was of <hi>merit.</hi> But, no great <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition</hi> can be observed in this: we are to climb higher; and in our ascent make choice of such Subjects, who appear equally seated in a sphear of Greatness; but jealous of one anothers ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing; contrive wayes of undermining them; though the issue tend to their own ruine. And this we derive from the Main Wheels, and Principal Movers in State-affairs: wherein eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one sitting near the Stern, transported with the height of ambition, and immoderate heat of preeminent desires, has made a private contract by way of Covenant, with his endeered thoughts, that he will either appear absolute in his commands, or fall under his own bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</p>
               <p>And to accomplish his ends (which many times bring him to an untimely end) he neglects
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:102167:45"/>
no opportunity, nor declines any difficulty. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations in these ambitious contests are wholly dis-valued. The neerer they be in blood, these <hi>Competitions</hi> generally procure them more hate; which seldom ends without blood. Of so high an estimate is the purchase of Honour, as it challengeth a Prerogative above affinity, amity, or what may seem dearest to Humane Society<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Caesar</hi> will admit of no <hi>Competitor.</hi> Two Suns cannot shine in one Sphear: nor two <hi>Eagles</hi> sharers in one Prey. It is above belief to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve how Rivolets of blood, streaming from one vein, should divide their course into seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Chanels: and by their impetuous motion, make their influences appear so brackish and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastfull one to another. Cast your eye aside, and you shall see what a coil this <hi>State-negotiator</hi> makes, to make himself envy'd! Sleep is a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to his eyes, and Rest an alien to those fruitless Projects of his active Brain. He suspects a Foe, though he see none; but truth is, he has rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to be jealous of none more than himself. For, Ambition hath been held the onely self-betrayer of her Master. Any one might justly wonder, how Man, indu'd with reason, and highly inabled by conference, should suffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be so deluded with the shadow of Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: which his Experience sufficiently informs him, to be the most incentive fuell for kindling Enmity, and the greatest disturber of Bosom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:102167:45"/>
and security. For, how should those sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred <hi>Palms</hi> of Peace flourish, where this <hi>Endive</hi> is planted? Neither is it the fortune of these <hi>rising Gourds,</hi> by their premature growth, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get Foes; but to make Foes of their best Friends, and that deservingly: for the acquisition of those immerited Honours usually so deprave their manners, and disorder their affections, as their grandure makes them forgetful of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; and with a slight aspect to pass by their antient Acquaintance. <hi>Philotas,</hi> when his Friend, who might have formerly challenged an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest in him, preferred his Sute unto him, hoping by his powerful mediation to prevail in his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress, he neglectfully rejected him; telling him, "He knew him not: But after that this Petitioner had return'd him sundry signal evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of their former familiarity;
<q>O, said that high-swoln Favourite, I must confess, I did sometimes know you; but I am not the same I was then. Too much familiarity with Persons of your quality might make me lose my self: and consequently eclipse that splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor which the Princes favour has bestow'd on me.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This it was, which made that Divine Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list to define <hi>Honour</hi> an <hi>Imposture,</hi> because apt to delude the Owner; by moulding numerous fancies in his brain: and by too eagre a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sute, and acquiesce to his humour; which in
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:102167:46"/>
short time exposeth his distemper'd <hi>Fancy</hi> to that incurable <hi>Frenzy,</hi> as he becomes his own Idolater: He holds himself secure, when most at distance with security: holding that most dear unto him, which proves his assiduate enemy. Thus in this <hi>State-Contest,</hi> it is their onely la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to shoulder out one another; where the stronger wins the Prize; whiles his disheartned <hi>Competitor</hi> sinks down with dishonour: So as he may properly use those words, which <hi>Eumenes</hi> did to <hi>Demetrius</hi>:
<q>I had been equal to thee in Honour, if thy Shoulders had not weighed heavier.</q>
But what advantage gains the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror</hi> by this Master-prize? A <hi>disguise</hi> onely, and an <hi>undermining danger.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His <hi>Disguise</hi> puts on a <hi>vizard</hi> of <hi>State</hi> gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, shrouded with converse, and acquaintance from strangers; wherein he grows an infinite Proficient, both for <hi>Dress</hi> and <hi>Language</hi>: Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving got the <hi>Spanish</hi> Shrug, and the <hi>French</hi> Cringe, with all those Courtly Garbs and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures that may most estrange him from the knowledg of his Familiars. His quaint Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement too has so well school'd him, as he can cross Proverbs, and tell the World that <hi>Interest can lie</hi>: For, his aims, in advantage to his own <hi>Interest,</hi> have altered his shape, by moulding him much like <hi>Tiberius,</hi> walking in the Clouds, and dissembling a guize unknown to his best Friends; seeming in <hi>appearance</hi> least, what he is
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:102167:46"/>
is <hi>really</hi> most. But it fares with him in his unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected fall, as it doth usually with all <hi>State-Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites</hi> in their decline. For, as they slighted their Friends in their <hi>rising</hi>; they find none to commiserate their condition at their <hi>setting.</hi> By shewing to their Inferiours a scornful contempt in their Height; they became contemptible to their deserted Acquaintance in their Ebb. His allusion was not improper, who resembled <hi>State-Competitors</hi> to <hi>Court Combatants.</hi> Whence it was, that that <hi>Heavenly Dog</hi> (for so <hi>Laertius</hi> calls him) being askt what was done at Court? told them,
<q>That they were tripping up one anothers heels.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now for that <hi>undermining danger,</hi> whereto (as we formerly toucht) they are most incident; they appear commonly nearest to it, when they hold themselves most distanc'd from it. Though <hi>Damocles</hi> Sword hang over his head by an hair; the sweetness of Soveraignty deludes him with the britle promise of Security.</p>
               <p>This rising Sprig sprung up to a surreptiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous growth, though numerous <hi>Competitors,</hi> like cunning <hi>Pioners,</hi> labour to undermine him; and his <hi>timing followers</hi> dayly fall from him (for such <hi>Rats</hi> will not stay long, when they see their House fall to decay) but in quest of better Masters swim with the stream, pursuing the current of that time, which may afford to their hungry hopes most advantage. Yet this secure
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:102167:47"/>
Favourite, I say, is so belulled with the <hi>Lethar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy</hi> of his expiring honour, as he takes no notice of these previous signals, nor divining Notions of his ensuing ruine: but conceipts that he has clipt the wings of Fortune, and that she has no power to fly from him. Mean while, his fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers fall from him; finding by degrees that his seam-rent <hi>Estate</hi> falls neither under any <hi>Predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of <hi>quantity</hi>; nor his declining <hi>Honour</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any <hi>Predicament</hi> of <hi>quality</hi>: but both shrunk down into a desperate precipice, without reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or hope of recovery.</p>
               <p>And so good night <hi>Competitor.</hi> The Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate is shut, and no hope of admittance.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>S a State-Empyrick, who pretends, and prescribes too, sundry prepos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous, or adventitious (and to himself most advantagious Cures) to all diseases, but effects no Cure. Yet the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded impudence of this Mercenary Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebank is such, as he must of <hi>necessity</hi> paste his poysonous <hi>Bills</hi> on every <hi>Post</hi>: and like a cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Impostor, disperse them in every blinde Corner.</p>
            <p>He pretends to <hi>Architecture,</hi> but acts more for <hi>Superstructure</hi> than <hi>Foundation.</hi> He would play the <hi>Navigator</hi> too, but without direction of <hi>Card,</hi> use of <hi>Stern,</hi> or <hi>Rudder</hi>: which must no less necessarily, than fatally, expose his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided Vessell to an inevitable danger. He has such Aery Crotchets in his <hi>Whymsicall</hi> brain, as he dare not safely discover, lest <hi>Common Sense</hi> should convince him of Error: notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all this, he holds fast to his <hi>Phanatick Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> and maugre all opposition, scorns to bough a foot of ground from his groundless
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:102167:48"/>
Positions. He partakes of no <hi>Humour</hi> less than <hi>Loyalty</hi>: having profest himself a Mortal Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to all Rules and Rights of Soveraignty. Yet should it be left to his Choice to give Laws to a Nation, or Mould Principles for the Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of a new Government; what an <hi>Vto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian</hi> State would he shape us? Our late cry'd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>down <hi>RVMP</hi> would appear a rare Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth unto it! He's a Bird of so changable an Ayry, as he cannot hold to one Nest: Neither can he for a World make his latter hour an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prover of what he resolv'd on in the former. He attests his Life to be a constant <hi>Duel</hi>; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in for want of a Combatant, he will not stick to present a <hi>Challenge</hi> to himself: and ingage his own Person to be his own Assailant, aspersing a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour on himself, should he chance to fail in answering this <hi>self-quarrell</hi>: being incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly at more distance with himfelf than any other Creature. Were he a Master of <hi>Musick</hi> he would fix much upon <hi>Ayrs,</hi> wherewith his unsetled brain is more than sufficiently stored. His on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Musical Lecture would run wholly on <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>; the highest Rapsody of his Fancy. He holds it an impossibility for any Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth to derive its Essence of Government from Order: He findes no such <hi>Rule</hi> in his <hi>Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxis.</hi> For recreation-sake he loves <hi>Fishing,</hi> but it must be in <hi>Troubled waters.</hi> Wherein if it be his fortune to catch any nibbling too greedily
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:102167:48"/>
at his Bait; he handles them, and hales them to that Precipice, whereto his distractions have irreparably thrown him. By this time, his irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular impudence has dragg'd him to that despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate madness, as he starts at the name of a KING, as if it were some Prodigious Title; and so it has ever appear'd to his Anarchial Conceptions. Would you have him discovered in his own po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture? Trust me, he were a rare Limner that could do it. <hi>Protean</hi> shapes cannot vye with his for variety. Sometimes like a melancholy <hi>Don,</hi> with his armes a <hi>Kembo,</hi> he walkes as if he went to quarrel with his own Shaddow. The Ayr breaths unkindly on him. The Sun too un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely cloaths his Beauty in a Cloud, purposely to dis-relish him: nothing suits well with his humour, because he personates to life a Man quite out of his humour. But truth is, he has lost himself, by losing the Issue of his Designs. Either was his Plot too high for his Pate, or his Pate too open for his Plot, as both fail'd him in his hopefullest addresses. Again, should you see him in the Career of his successfull Projects strut along like a Man of a new mold, or rather like one made up of <hi>Wainscot,</hi> you would take him for a nice Representative, formally modish all o're; for as his <hi>look</hi> appears so supercilious, as it redarts every eye with a scorn; so be his joynts so inflexible, as they will submit to no Civil-Salute. But thanks to his sinister Stars,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:102167:49"/>
seldom, or never be his hateful Assays accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with such success, as it may afford him occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion long to rejoyce: or for Good Men who ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor his Designs greatly to repine. States appear ever in their fullest Orb, and highest Splendor, when this State-shark by a vertical Swinge, is at his lowest Ebb, and quite driven out of his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour. Neither yet could any Sage, or appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive <hi>Head-piece</hi> hold such a <hi>Shallop</hi> as this, a Person of considerable danger to any well-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged State. For, observe him generally, and you shall find him without much Scrutiny, that though he make villany his Minion, and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery his Bosom-Companion: yet he becomes so unfaithfull a <hi>Secretary</hi> to his own Counsells, as they either betray him, or he circumvents him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self by discovering them.</p>
            <p>It was my fortune sometimes to be known to a <hi>Stirring Spirit</hi> of this <hi>Leven</hi>; who, beside his transcendent dexterity in designing (the prime faculty of this latter age) pretended to be a Person singularly gifted in the smooth art of a <hi>Pen-Man</hi>; and to compleat the work which his <hi>Address</hi> shap't him to, he had a <hi>Reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Character</hi> of such intricacy as none ever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Use, or <hi>Clavis</hi> of it beside himself. But see how farr he went beside himself! For that artful secrecy whereof he was foolishly confident, that by the Agency of his <hi>Rebellious Sectaries,</hi> might procure him a badge of honour (as the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:102167:49"/>
Tide turn'd) twicht up his blasted hopes in an halter. This was a <hi>Phanaticks</hi> fate of high prize. May all such who nere leave a Civil State without a Flame, Perish in the like Nouze.</p>
            <p>Now to distinguish him, and display his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive quality in his own posture and colour; I shall give you the trouble to render you this <hi>troublesome</hi> Creature in a clearer Character. That as the <hi>Leper</hi> in the Old Law was to proclaim his dangerous Infection, by crying out, <hi>I am unclean, I am unclean</hi>; or, as upon the Door of any Person, whose house was visited with the <hi>Plague,</hi> this has been, and is usually writ in fair Rubrick-Letters, <hi>Lord have Mercy upon us</hi>: so this <hi>Contagious Member,</hi> whose Factious Nature out-strips the malignity of the worst in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious distemper, may be publickly discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and his hatefull Society timely avoided: which, unless severely censured, might bring to that State which he labours to imbroil, an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demical Infection.</p>
            <p>It is neither the least, nor lowest of his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs, wherewith his seditious <hi>Forge</hi> is plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuously stored; of having the faculty of play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>State-Libeller</hi>: And he holds corres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence with his <hi>Instrumental Ingles</hi> to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perse those <hi>Tart Papers.</hi> Wherein it is the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of these <hi>Phanatick Malecontents</hi> to vilifie the Quality of those <hi>Persons,</hi> whom in Loyalty they are obliged to serve. And, from whence
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:102167:50"/>
Originally springs this Anarchial Spleen? Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from a private disgust, of being crost in the pursute of their Preferment; which their daring confidence brought them into an easie belief, that their Parts, and Qualities well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served: or from an imbred hate to such who were preferred before them. This begot amongst the antient Ethnicks that ingenuity of fancy, in their height and heat of Ambition, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent torrent of Competition, as they in short time practis'd the art of teaching their <hi>incaged Birds</hi> articulately to prate, and in their taught Diallect scornfully to jeer their <hi>Contestees,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were in quest of Fancy or Honour. This it was that made that egregious Buffoon of <hi>Mantua</hi> to prefer a Bill of Inditement against a <hi>Scandalous Bird,</hi> as he call'd her, for impeaching his Fame; for which dammage, said he, the ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish Bird could never make him amends. But we have here other <hi>Phanatick Fools</hi> to supply the office of those <hi>Canting Fowls,</hi> who play the <hi>Night-walkers</hi> (for their works hate the light) making it their only design to asperse dishonour upon Persons of Honour: nay, to blast Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty with an ignominious touch; purposely to weaken Loyalty, by alienating the fluctuant affections of such Timists from their Allegiance; whose malleable temper might have prov'd sound enough, if those poysonous Ingrediences had not corrupted their Principles. And to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:102167:50"/>
their Essay, it is the usual Custom of these <hi>Phanaticks,</hi> to lay plausive, and attractive Baits to catch those unwary Novices. Privileges of Right; Liberty of Subject; and a Levelling Line, Chalking forth a way to the freedom of a <hi>Platonick Common-weal,</hi> are specious induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to <hi>State-Libertines.</hi> They are weary of the Yoak of Subjection; and hold it an <hi>Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Bondage; till a legal Censure, or some other Contingency (which must be of a corroding quality) reclaim them from their folly.</p>
            <p>Truth is, this <hi>Phanatick,</hi> whose ranting hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour convicts him a <hi>Phrentick,</hi> having already forfeited his Wits, and expos'd his Interest to all hazards, has so desperately suffered that small pittance of <hi>Iudgment</hi> whereto he pretended (if any were extant) to be over-sway'd, and over-swoln with Passion, as his distemper admits small hopes of recovery. Neither is this turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Spirit onely predominant over him; for it has begot in him such a self-opinionate madness, as he would hold it a <hi>madder Parliament</hi> than that antient Session at <hi>Oxford,</hi> if he were not made sole-<hi>Chairman</hi> in it: yet were he design'd for that <hi>Place,</hi> he would vary so much in his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted Judgment, from what he had formerly stated, as if he had gon to <hi>Bedlam</hi> for some new advice. He would play his part bravely with the <hi>Antipodes:</hi> for it has been ever his course to walk in a Tract contrary to other Men: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling

none so nearly as <hi>Damocles,</hi> whose use it was to <hi>sweat</hi> in the <hi>Shade,</hi> and <hi>shake</hi> in the <hi>Sun.</hi> He is naturally affected to no humour more than an unsociable kind of Stoicism: and would gladly play the down-right <hi>Cynick,</hi> if he had so much wit as to present the <hi>Moral Dog</hi> in his right posture. But, having neither read Books to inform him, nor Men to improve him, he falls off pitifully, discovering his defects in all. For all this, that un-steady Anvile of his Brain must be alwayes set a-working; which, though it prove no less useless to himself, than obnoxious to the State; that day passeth not over his head, which affords not new matter for some occasional Project or other: but so imprudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carried, as in stead of the States, it falls out happily the Projectors Traitor.</p>
            <p>Shall we now suppose this <hi>Grand-Gull</hi> catcht in his own Gin? But let him expect no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieve, nor least hope of Indemnity. That Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick <hi>Tiberius</hi> who could walk so covertly in the Clouds; and disguise his designs beyond the reach of discovery; after his detection, and detention of some notorious Persons of this quality, though he were much sollicited by his nearest Favourites for their inlargement, he return'd them this unsatisfactory Answer:
<q>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Leopards may be kept in their Grates without fear; but so cannot these <hi>State-Whiff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi>: for those <hi>wilde-Beasts</hi> are satisfied with
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:102167:51"/>
their prey without further designing; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as these <hi>Tame-Beasts</hi> prey upon the fat of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, and act our Ruine by their undermining.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Designs come from Reason; which no Grate can confine: whereas Creatures govern'd by sense are by restraint secure. Whence we may gather, that no Art, nor Experiment, be it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so exquisite, may apply any Cure to this Sore; nor Cordial to allay this Malady (acting so strongly for disloyalty) saving that <hi>Licinian</hi> Cord which prepared a nouze for a <hi>Phanatick</hi> Neck, to secure that indanger'd State from the attempts of a bosom Foe, and fatal issue of a grounded fear.</p>
            <p>In his perusal of those <hi>Divine Counsells,</hi> which should (if his Brains were rightly setled) have especial influence over him, there is no one <hi>Precept</hi> he relisheth worse, than that of <hi>Fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, Honouring the King, and from medling with seditious Men.</hi> It was never his happiness to be vers'd in these <hi>Principles,</hi> and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of hard digestion to his crude Stomack. He is highly discontented, both with our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State</hi>; yet can his ravell'd judgment find no just exception to quarrell with either. He has his constant Emissories, whom, if his Fortunes mount so high, he makes his Pensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners: but, in very short time they either grow weary of their Master, or he of them: the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty of the one, or jealousie of the other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:102167:52"/>
a divorse betwixt them. Yet this fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slows not his work: he can Swim, and hold up his Head in those <hi>Waters</hi> of <hi>Division,</hi> without help; unless the Bladder of vain-glory hoise him up; which by a fatal overture unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, makes him Sink under his Burden, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangling himself in the weeds of inextricable ruine.</p>
            <p>The onely News which take him in the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any <hi>Diurnall,</hi> is the Variance, and Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of States. No Countrey-Cormorant can delight more in the prediction of a Dearth, than he of a Princes Death: or some dangerous im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broilment in the mis-management of Publick Affairs. He makes himself most known by three discoveries; <hi>Habit, Company,</hi> and <hi>Discourse.</hi> In the <hi>first</hi> as <hi>phantastick,</hi> as his Brain is <hi>Phana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick.</hi> Some quaint humerous device or other must help to distinguish him by a special Badge, or Cognizance, from Persons of other Subsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. We have had here domineering among us our <hi>Titere Tuu's,</hi> and <hi>Bugle Blew's. Hectors,</hi> and Blades of Metall these pretended to be, and, without doubt, had prov'd so, if their <hi>Courage</hi> had kept Correspondence with their <hi>Countenance.</hi> But these two stood at such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, as <hi>Camp Valour,</hi> and <hi>Carpet Honour</hi> could not in their <hi>Scutcheons</hi> shew more difference. None more generally daring in tongue, nor more provoking in affronts, nor less performing
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:102167:52"/>
in actions of Challenge. That word of <hi>reputation</hi> appears at first sight a Notion of high Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; Life is but a vapour in Competition with it: yet will they <hi>vapour</hi> out, rather than ingage their Persons for preserving it. Opinion is as close to them as their Garment: Both which they usually put off at night: but the <hi>change</hi> of the one is at more <hi>charge</hi> than the other: the one may keep its place, while the other is at pawn. Where the disposure of his Raiment, in all Mens esteem, redounds more to his honour, and renders him the sweeter savour: for his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion is distastfull to Common sense, while the Credit of his Habit lies in <hi>Lavender.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For his <hi>Company,</hi> he makes choice of such, as none would make choice of but himself. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther antient <hi>Separists,</hi> or fresh <hi>Proselites,</hi> they are boulted from the same Bran, and unleaven'd Lump, whereof himself was moulded. Birds of a Feather flock together. A dangerous Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion (trust me) for a Civil Society to mix with. These, for want of better imployment (for baser Stuff cannot be vended, nor to the <hi>Brokers</hi> disadvantage more exposed) pull out their wilde, and illiterate Notes; which upon their unhappy perusal retein the like concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and concordance, as their harsh, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>harmonious Spirits which Pen'd them.</p>
            <p>These, in the Production of their dis-joynted Annotations (if their <hi>Extemporal Spirits</hi> will
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:102167:53"/>
spare them so much time, as to deliver their <hi>gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Conceptions</hi> in Writing) pretend to infinite humility; yet in their <hi>Conventual Assemblies,</hi> they cannot so cunningly palliate their Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie, but a <hi>supercilious immeriting</hi> Conceipt of their own Parts (holding themselves incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably <hi>Gifted-Men</hi>) makes their Ambition burst out; and after some frivolous, fruitless disputes, without the least tincture of Wit, or vigour of Judgment, many times fall from breaking <hi>Prisci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> head (a most dispensable Error) to <hi>break Peace</hi> with their own. Each of them would play the <hi>Rabbi</hi>; yet, though they be of a <hi>Iewish</hi> Nature, they cannot possibly acquire that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; seeing neither Civil Carriage, nor Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage will afford any of them the repute of a Scholar.</p>
            <p>Thus ends their <hi>Convention</hi> generally with <hi>Contention</hi>; their <hi>Society</hi> with <hi>Civil Warr,</hi> for want of <hi>Civility.</hi> Their <hi>Pharisaical</hi> Pride will admit no <hi>Shroud</hi>; an eagre pursute after Pree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence leaves them incapable of shame: <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deservingly high,</hi> being of more estimate with them, than <hi>deservingly low.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To <hi>descend</hi> to their <hi>Discourse,</hi> it is egregiously <hi>Course</hi>: Circularly prodigious, having neither <hi>head</hi> nor <hi>foot.</hi> Ridiculously impertinent, yet ever hinting at <hi>faction,</hi> to discover the maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their disposition.</p>
            <p>"They have heard how Kings are bound by
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:102167:53"/>
their Piety, and by no other Obligation. But they hold this for no Authentick Assertion: they would have the wayes of Princes chalked forth by their Line; and by their Judgment to rise or fall. They hold their Clandestine Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sells in extent farr above all Arbitrary Power. This scrues them up to that Confidence, as it brings them to knock, with that saucy <hi>Rochel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,</hi> at his Princes Gate, and like one of our New-illuminated Saintlings, rapt with a <hi>Phana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> Fury, cry out: <hi>Keep not back Counsel when it may do good.</hi>
               <q>Well, said the Prince, if it be good I will take advice of mine own heart, and so try the goodness of it; for I have heard, Sir, to answer to your Scripture; <hi>Take Counsel of thine own heart, for there is none more faithful unto Thee than it.</hi>
               </q>
This still'd the <hi>Phanatical Separist,</hi> leaving him to his Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net Counsel, without any farther unmannerly addresses. Again, some of these <hi>impostur'd Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> have such Worms in their Brains, that though they have frequently heard, how, <hi>He that provoketh a King to anger sinneth against his own Soul</hi>; Yet will not these tumultuary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendiaries stick to exasperate his indignation, not onely by their Seditious Doctrine, but by their Statizing Libels; which sufficiently mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fests their Qualification, and from what Spirits such phrensies arise.</p>
            <p>But these may be thought to pass under the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:102167:54"/>
Notion of <hi>Ranters</hi>; we will return to our <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,</hi> or rather <hi>possest Phanatick,</hi> that <hi>Mock-Sun,</hi> or <hi>New-Light</hi>; who, by his Incredible Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Inspirations, Revelations, and Enthusiastick Rapsodies, intranceth his deluded Followers. This <hi>Gloworme,</hi> with his deceiving Splendor, and Adulterate Fervor, holds nearer resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to none, than the Pharisaical <hi>Gnostick,</hi> who pretends to be as perfect as any <hi>Apostle.</hi> Or like the Frontless <hi>Mounte Qank,</hi> who takes the Confidence, with a Mimick gesture to delude simple People with his Sophisticated Druggs. So this <hi>Doctrinal quack</hi> cheats his weak Audito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry by the <hi>Decoy</hi> of Specious Spiritual Titles. Copper all over, though they bear an Orient Colour. These <hi>Whited Walls</hi> are all for <hi>Faith</hi>; grounding their <hi>Subsistence</hi> on other Mens <hi>Works.</hi> Active Zelots in pursute of gain, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they prove such useful <hi>Saduces,</hi> as they get no Proselite without a gainful Contract. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science is their only Impost, which they scrue up to their highest Interest: wherein they trace the thriving steps of a cunning Prostitute, who will make sure work to have something in hand before he deal.</p>
            <p>Thus makes our <hi>Phanatick</hi> such <hi>use</hi> of his angling, without much <hi>useful Doctrine,</hi> as his <hi>Temporal Purchase</hi> farr surmounts the value of his <hi>Spiritual Practice.</hi> For this over-fed <hi>Porket</hi> has been so fatned in his <hi>Sty,</hi> so highly improv'd
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:102167:54"/>
in the grandeur of his State; as he is now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd to <hi>bid his Soul take her rest.</hi> But, <hi>sleep</hi> she may in her <hi>Scism,</hi> and <hi>slumber</hi> without sense of her Sin; but <hi>rest</hi> she cannot.</p>
            <p>To limn this <hi>Phanatick</hi> to his full body: and display him in his native Hypocritical Quality, would require much art, and more expence of time, than a discreet Pen would willingly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow on such an ayry Subject; whose <hi>Principles</hi> disown the <hi>Interest</hi> of a <hi>Subject.</hi>

It was his grief, to see Goodness grow great. Neither was this all. He understood (which was an ementitious conceipt, not worth harbouring in an honest breast) that some of those <hi>Titles</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed on him for his incomparable service to
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:102167:58"/>
his Prince, and high improvement to the State, had relation by way of <hi>Denomination</hi> to one of his <hi>usurped Mannors</hi>: from which groundless oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, this rankling heat of that raging <hi>Rabby</hi> broke forth into that unmanly fury, as he found a way (a way leading to Death) of dispensing with the ruine of his perjur'd Soul, upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he might bereave his supposed Enemy of life. And all this was acted in the <hi>Capitol</hi>: and yet unreveng'd.</p>

               <p>He was a Person, doubtless, of high accomplishment: nay, such an one as <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Art</hi> might seem to have contended whether of them should have more obliged him to their endeerments: So amply had they contributed in their several offices to the compleating of that <hi>States-Man.</hi> So, as it was my fortune one day to hear this positively asserted in a Company of unquestion'd judgments: That if he had sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viv'd the various distempers of those times, and the subtile practices of his profest Enemies, by whom he became treacherously surprized; and when he least suspected, unawares attach'd; he had not onely secured his unfortunate <hi>Master</hi> from all ensuing danger; and preserv'd the safety and union of the State to his succeeding honour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but likewise in the management of State-Affairs, as far over-topt <hi>OLIVER,</hi> for all his jugling compliance with <hi>MAZARENE</hi>; as ever <hi>Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene</hi> did the short-Mushroom honour of hair-brain'd
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:102167:59"/>
                  <hi>Mazarella.</hi> Never was <hi>Head-piece</hi> more richly stor'd, nor more undeservedly lopped. Which was strongly attested by that Politick <hi>Cardinal</hi>; who, upon the report of his Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, used these words:
<q>Had that mad sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Isle but one Wise Man in it, and could it render him no better reward, nor find other imployment for his <hi>Head,</hi> than to put it up in a <hi>Bagg,</hi> and confine his Wisdom to so early a Shroud!</q>
This States-Mans jeer might have brought those who were Principal Actors in contriving his death, to a deep resentment of that irreparable wound they had given to their Countrey, in their relentless pursuance of his Tragedy: But, hope of reward, or desire of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge had so preoccupated their thoughts, as it had steel'd them with that wilde <hi>Irish</hi> antient resolution, Never to hold themselves secure from their Foe, till they might play at foot-ball with his head.</p>

               <p>That was the onely way indeed to catch the Old One: But some of those <hi>diving Didappers</hi> have since that time no less unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natly catch't themselves. It had been much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for them to have falln gently under the <hi>lash</hi> of my <hi>Rod,</hi> than desperately to have twisted <hi>nouzes</hi> for their own <hi>necks,</hi> as some of those <hi>Achitophels</hi> have lately done.</p>

               <p>And it was done to their honour, for it sav'd the Hangman a labour. But, in
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:102167:59"/>

               <p>I must confess, <hi>Calanus,</hi> our gelded Synodal, or Parliament. Epitome, maintains Rules contrary to the Principles of all Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy; for they have hitherto most resolutely held a <hi>Vacuum</hi>; whereof, though <hi>Pryn,</hi> with other more <hi>Auricular Members,</hi> labour'd strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to continue them; their opinions, (because Legal and Loyal) would not be admitted; the doors of that <hi>Self-mad-House</hi> were commanded to be shut against them, and those Excepted Members wholly Secluded; and in part so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd, as they became debarred from challeng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their just and lawful Privilege in the House; which by antient Prescription, and successive Concession, they might duely pretend to. But those few scattered <hi>Gleanings</hi> that remain sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and shuddring within, have good cause to be more feverish than those who are shut out. For they cannot chuse but hear a muttring of a Change: and then woe be to them if the <hi>Tide</hi> turn. For, then take heed that the <hi>Capitol</hi> be not metamorphosed into a <hi>Scaffold.</hi> Where those peremptory pragmatical Coxcombs, so much inraged with spleen, or transported with Disloyalty of spirit, must be brought forth of those <hi>Tyring-houses,</hi> wherein they have been so long <hi>disguising</hi> themselves, to act their <hi>last Parts</hi>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:102167:60"/>

               <p>Never Sir; my <hi>Black Rod</hi> observed ever that regular discipline, as it became a <hi>State-Academy</hi> for all degrees, Sciences and Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

               <p>O Sir, have you not heard a Story; which though it be a fiction, yet it retains a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Moral; how <hi>Proserpine</hi> had her <hi>Misset,</hi> as well as <hi>Pluto</hi> his <hi>Cerberus</hi>; but it was ever ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd that the poor <hi>Misset</hi> was husht, and gave not a yelp, when that <hi>Hellish Mastiff</hi> begun to roar! So fared it with me and my Officials. No sooner was the <hi>High Court of Iustice</hi> erected, and
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:102167:61"/>
with poor Cavaliers blood imbrued, than my <hi>Black Rod</hi> became untwisted. It was not for us <hi>inferiour Groundlings</hi> to mutter, much less to murmur, when that <hi>terrible Minotaur</hi> begun to thunder. The <hi>Gibbet</hi> grew farr above the height of my <hi>Rod.</hi> The Tower-Hill <hi>Axe</hi> soon cut in pieces those blasted Sprigs of my dis-au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized <hi>Lash.</hi>

               <p>But now the <hi>State,</hi> like a late-reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd <hi>Bedlam,</hi> is rid of both.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Atreus.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis true; there is no <hi>Lunacy</hi> so vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, but it has its <hi>Lucida Intervalla</hi>; but one <hi>forein</hi> drop of <hi>Coloquintida</hi> strengthned with a <hi>Spanish, French,</hi> or <hi>Imperial</hi> Ingredience may utterly spoil the Concoction of our <hi>English</hi> broath.

               <p>Such fear, as it is falln into a Quotidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Ague.

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:102167:61"/>
and if it prov'd otherwise, all our Nation would find cause to <hi>sweat</hi>; the danger appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so Epidemical. For, though we subsist like <hi>Monstrous Members</hi> without an <note n="*" place="bottom">Relating to the Raging Reign of our late <hi>Protector.</hi>

The sad consequence whereof has brought us to that desperate Condition, as no man may safely challenge a <hi>propriety</hi> in his own. The onely way to live peaceably, is to suffer patiently: and with a pleasing smile (though there be no cause for't) to entertain the affronts of an imperious Incroacher with such indifference; as neither the <hi>Agent</hi> may take occasion of picking a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel at his Murmuring; nor the <hi>Patient</hi> preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice his Cause by his remediless Contesting.</p>

            <p>To be thought <hi>Great,</hi> or <hi>Wise,</hi> is their sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary End; though their indiscreet Carriage merit neither of those attributes.</p>
            <p>It was my fortune lately to be present at One of these <hi>Sessionary Commissions</hi>; where One of that <hi>Knowing Brotherhood</hi> desiring nothing more than to be held by the <hi>Commonty</hi> an eminent awful Man, suddenly starting up, took a great Oath, (even by his rich <hi>Plume</hi> of Feathers) that if the Subsidy Men then and there assembled did not forthwith pay in their Moneys, <hi>He would smook them.</hi> Whereto, one no less Metally than Wittily answered him:
<q>Sir, by smooking us, you may chance to singe your own Feather, and so darnish the colour of your Oath;
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:102167:65"/>
which were a great pity, being the handsomst thing about you.</q>
Which smart Answer begot such a general laughter in the Court, as <hi>Silence</hi> could not be procur'd, though often command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, a long time after.</p>
            <p>Was not this fair-plum'd Commissioner of a quick dispatch? yes sure, but of a weak brood; rightly numbred amongst those <hi>Hymerian</hi> Flyes, or <hi>Picene</hi> Emmets, hatcht before they got shape.</p>
            <p>These <hi>Rhadamantades,</hi> who scatter their brains in the Ayr, should be used like that <hi>Florentine Fool</hi>; who, holding himself the best Man in <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> was sentenc'd to be Whipt out of his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour by two Dwarfs, till wearied with their lash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, he no less senselesly than pitifully avouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that <hi>Dwarfs</hi> were taller than <hi>Gyants</hi>; and that high Men were the lowest men in <hi>Florence</hi>: which absurdity sav'd him from further Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Howsoever, to perfect the Cure in these <hi>Ayry Ranters,</hi> whom this Age looks upon as the infinitest Pretenders, confident'st Undertakers, and Profusest Scatterers in all our Island; it were not amiss if they were put to School (if capable of such useful Knowledg) before they be admitted to Publick Interests. Assistants in these should not be of a low level.</p>
            <p>It was antiently decreed by the <hi>Ephori,</hi> in that flourishing State of <hi>Athens</hi>; that no <hi>Beardless</hi> Person, were he of what quality or descent soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:102167:66"/>
should be call'd as <hi>Assistant</hi> in any Publick Service of State; though that was by maturer deliberation, mainly opposed, alleging, how many might be young in <hi>years,</hi> who were <hi>old</hi> in <hi>houres.</hi> How incapable then are they who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear neither old in years nor houres, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of any Publick Affair conducing to the welfare of the State?
<q>Were it not a great madness, said our Soveraign King <hi>Iames,</hi> (a Prince whose constant addresses were beautifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Palms of Peace) for the Master of a Team of Horses, being furnish'd with some of a clearer sight, to set a <hi>blind Horse</hi> before?</q>
We have store of quick-sighted Men; let such be deputed, leaving these Ayry-Spirited <hi>Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wings,</hi> who leave their Nests before they'r taught to fly.</p>
            <p>Such flickering Birds, by reason of their untime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly flight, have been ever held incapable of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick imployments: Persons of prudent and composed tempers are the properest <hi>Engines</hi> for such Affairs, and the discreetest <hi>Moderators</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Subject</hi>; by rendring to the <hi>One</hi> what he by his <hi>Prerogative</hi> may justly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; and informing the <hi>other</hi> what he ought duely to perform.</p>
            <p>In your Personal Execution of which Office, you are to imitate the course of an expert and experient'st <hi>Pilot,</hi> by avoiding such perilous <hi>Shelves</hi> as may probably indanger your <hi>Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionary
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:102167:66"/>
Passage.</hi> These are briefly toucht in the <hi>Act</hi> it self, by which you are to be directed; and expresly taught, to do nought either for <hi>Fear, Favour,</hi> or <hi>Hatred.</hi> Being the very same which our best <hi>Ethnicks</hi> exactly observed in their Course of Justice; commanding, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing should be acted to the dishonour of their Proceedings, either for <hi>Amity, Enmity,</hi> or <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity</hi>: Such an even and equal Scale poized the Conduct of their Actions. And this they did, without any future hope of a fruition of further glory, than their Poetical fancy of those <hi>Elysian Fields,</hi> and their imaginary Fame to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity; the sole aims of their Eternity.</p>
            <p>That small glimpse, or beamling, which they had received from the Light of Nature, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any farther influence, produc'd these rare effects; which might justly beget a shame in those, who more divinely illumined, though they believe an Eternity, and the End of their Creation, Supreme Felicity; fall incomparably short of those <hi>Naturalists</hi> in the Course of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature, nay, even of Civil Morality. Store of <hi>Instances</hi> might be return'd you in this, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving no less your admiration than imitation.</p>
            <p>Rake up the Records of former times, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in true Native Honesty flourished, and <hi>Political Designs</hi> (of the <hi>Teeming Birth</hi> whereof every Nation sadly laboureth) appeared Strangers; and you shall find sundry imitable Mirrors of
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:102167:67"/>
this kind; whose uprightness in the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of State-Affairs needed no other Annal, nor Monument to Memorize them, than the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Fame of their unquestion'd deportment; which begot to them a reverence, and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought for advancement in the Common-Weal where they were seated.</p>
            <p>As in the first place, to insist upon every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular that may obstruct your Course in the Execution of your Office, whereto you are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed; you shall find one of those <hi>Ethnicks,</hi> though a firm Professor, and Preserver of <hi>Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> neglect the sollicitancy of his <hi>Friend</hi> in an action of Favour, saying,
<q>Dear is my Friend, but dearer is my Reputation: I may have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Friends, though I lose thee; but in losing God, I can have no more: there is but one God. He is a treacherous Friend, who makes his Friend a Foe to himself.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Neither were these less armed against the fury of Revenge. <hi>Enmity,</hi> though never so mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, could not decline them, no more than <hi>Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> could over-byas them in the direct line and path of their proceedings. One of them could say, like a brave Commander of his own Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
<q>I shall accompt it the lowest of my <hi>Scene,</hi> to take Revenge of mine Enemy to my own disadvantage. Neither do I intend to play so much the Fools part, to ingage a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick reproach for a Private revenge. He does
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:102167:67"/>
himself the greatest wrong, who labours to right himself, by doing his Enemy wrong. In Publick Places, where Offices of Justice are to be Administred, and what is due to every one justly distributed, not so much as the least thought of a bosom-injury is to be fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, much less discovered. He deserves not the <hi>Place</hi> where he sits, who sits only to take revenge of him whom he hates.</q>
            </p>
            <p>That discreet <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Cleob.</hi>
               </note> Sage well deserved to be called to the Dignity of one of the <hi>Ephori,</hi> who knew (by the attest of the whole <hi>Senat</hi>) how to bear and digest injuries: and in what manner to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mean himself on the Seat of <hi>Iustice</hi>; neither by eying his Friend with a countenance of Favour, nor his Foe with an intentional displeasure. Whence it was, that in <hi>Athens</hi> were set up in their High Court of Judicature, <hi>Astraeas</hi> Scale, and <hi>Tidaeus</hi> Shield: the one to ballance the just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Cause; the other to support it. For Experience, our best Mistriss, in the process of Humane Affairs, may sufficiently inform us; that though Justice bestow her strength and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most endeavour, the best Cause may suffer, wanting a powerful Fortress to support her.</p>
            <p>There is another <hi>Shelf</hi> too, no less dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous than either of the former; and this is <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity</hi>; being such an universal Leprosie, as we may worthily accompt him a rare Man, that is advanc'd to a Place of Profit, or Receipt of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:102167:68"/>
and has got the faculty of holding his <hi>mercenary hand</hi> from <hi>taking.</hi> This <hi>self-interest</hi> is a perillous Copes-mate; apt to infect where it consorts. Nay, such an absolute Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress over this <hi>Little World,</hi> Man, as it is held the <hi>Wheel</hi>; that with its career turns the course of all his actions. O how many have inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately perished by the poysonous Pills of this familiar and bosom-nurs'd Impostor!</p>
            <p>We shall little need to travel far for Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this kind: our own Coast can furnish us with plentious store, and in high Place, and of eminent quality: Persons excellently gifted, who, miserably depraved by that infectious malady of corrupt <hi>Gehezi,</hi> suffer'd themselves to ingage their honour for shameful lucre: nay, to aggravate their folly, how many have we known, who, continent enough in their own desires, through an ambitious humour of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining their <hi>riotous followers</hi> in a deportment above their rank or quality, have patiently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dur'd to see themselves with <hi>open eyes</hi> palpably cousen'd, and abused, by those <hi>Officious Lerchers,</hi> and <hi>Licentious Lechers,</hi> to their irreparable dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour, without gain to themselves!</p>
            <p>Now for this <hi>Office</hi> whereto you are deputed, much cannot be expected, because little will be offered; yet as <hi>Petilarceny</hi> by our Law is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishable, as well as <hi>Higher Felony,</hi> though in a lower quality: so there be sundry <hi>petty abuses</hi>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:102167:68"/>
which may usually occurr, in the Execution of these Offices, which by a superiour Power, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve due Censure. And, from what source may these Obliquities arise, but from your easie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivence towards those <hi>Puny Clarks</hi> imployed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you?</p>
            <p>These, though they know little, they can find out the way of exacting <hi>Fees,</hi> where none are due. No <hi>Discharge</hi> nor <hi>Acquittance</hi> must pass up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Receipt</hi> without advantage: wherein, though it redound to the Clarks Gain, it may be proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call'd the Masters Crime. Neither can I be less than jealous of the <hi>Officers</hi> themselves, but that some of them, through their indigence of spirit, will not stick to become <hi>Master-Sharers</hi> in these imposed Exactions. But, this is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd so covertly, that they know how to <hi>wipe</hi> their <hi>Mouths</hi> when they have <hi>eaten</hi> the <hi>sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice:</hi> resting secure from the confidence they have, that none sees them.</p>
            <p>Thus the <hi>Subject</hi> not onely <hi>prayes,</hi> but <hi>pays</hi> for the tender of his own; returning dis-satisfied in all, in that he cannot receive from the penuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Clark an Acquittance for what he has pay'd, unless he inlarge the Accompt above what the <hi>Act</hi> injoyns the <hi>Subject</hi> to pay, or the Officer to receive.</p>
            <p>Such as these deserve well to have that pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment inflicted on them, which that <hi>Sicilian Rogue</hi> had pronounced on him for abusing the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:102167:69"/>
State with his Forgeries, and counterfeat Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations: being Sentenc'd to have his skin flaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and made <hi>Parchment</hi> on; whereon was to be writ in fair <hi>Capitals</hi> all such abusive Cheats as he had used: and to have it hung up in the <hi>Publick Court</hi> for an Annual Record, or Caveat to Posterity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to deterr others from practising the like.</p>
            <p>Neither is it to be doubted, but if due <hi>Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination</hi> were taken at this time of the <hi>mis-car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage</hi> of our <hi>Officials,</hi> there might be found more than a <hi>good number</hi> guilty in this kind. Nor is there any thing more seriously considerable in these Publick Accompts, than an exact inquisiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on after these self-interested men; whose corrupt demeanure too usually foments a disgust be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Prince and Subject. This the Historian well observed, saying,
<q>That <hi>Vespatians</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors of his <hi>Vrine Money</hi> discontented the <hi>Romans</hi> more, than the Imposition.</q>
Wherein one no less smartly than wittily reply'd to a <hi>Tax-Master,</hi> upon his exaction of Fees: <hi>It seems, Friend, by your high demands, that we must pay more than our Water comes to: We are well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with paying</hi> Caesar <hi>for distilling our Water, but not with you for casting it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These <hi>Casters</hi> are such <hi>Castawayes,</hi> as they oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times cast down the Governor under whom they live, and by whose Command they are deputed to such tempting Offices. Tempting I may just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly term them; for, methinks, I hear them inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuously
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:102167:69"/>
confess with that corrupt Factor,
<q>They could be as honest as any Mortals breathing, if profit did not tempt them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Which aery excuse the notorioust <hi>Way-man</hi> may make, in defence of his taking Trade, as well as these; for were there no hope of gain, the Thief would take no pleasure in his perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Way-dialect of <hi>Stand</hi> and <hi>Deliver.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can I see why a severer Sentence should be pronounced on an <hi>High-way Taker,</hi> than a <hi>State-Iugler.</hi> Their desires are grounded on equal Principles; the onely difference in their course of Practice is this: the one playes his tricks more covertly than the other. The one wears his <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sard</hi> on his <hi>Face,</hi> the other on his <hi>Breast.</hi> But much less Art is requir'd in that Work of the <hi>Way,</hi> than Designs of the <hi>Pate.</hi> This relyes much on an active spirit; that on a subtile brain.</p>
            <p>Now I must tell you, Sir, how I have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in my imployment in these Services, usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly observed how the indigence of Agents, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow'd on these Affairs, works strange effects in the current of all Publick Proceedings. Hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty is dangerously incountred, when accosted by Poverty.</p>
            <p>Ships Sail safely, and hold their road calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when they meet with no surging waves to combat with, nor contrary winds to play, and apply their fury on their <hi>Top-sails.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In these times, where <hi>Corruption</hi> has crept so
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:102167:70"/>
subtilely into every <hi>Official Corner,</hi> and with a strange kind of confidence rides on its <hi>foot-Cloath,</hi> as if it had got a <hi>privilege</hi> to abuse <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice</hi> with impunity; it were a rare sight to see a Person of that even temper, whom Fortune cannot conquer, nor hope of preferment alter. The thoughts of a <hi>better World</hi> become such strangers to <hi>Man,</hi> as they <hi>un-man</hi> him, and make him forgetful of his <hi>Primitive</hi> honour, or of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing hopes hereafter.</p>
            <p>It were easie to present to your view, with out any <hi>artificial Scean</hi> at all, to display them, sundry Persons <hi>desertlesly</hi> made great, how they have laid a <hi>rust</hi> on their <hi>gilded Honour</hi>; as if they intended by a <hi>just fate,</hi> through their abusive Cheats, and dangerous Designs, to throw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves down to the <hi>dust</hi> from whence they were raised.</p>
            <p>These might be compared to that unadvis'd <hi>Numidian,</hi> who being advanc'd from a <hi>Flax-man</hi> to a Place of Quality; but resting dis-satisfi'd with that Preferment, by playing the cunning Jugler, he was adjudged to have his new-pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas'd <hi>Honour</hi> twich't up in a <hi>Flaxen Halter,</hi> from whence he had his first Rise and Vocation.</p>
            <p>That wise Politician gave us a singular Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Election of Persons fit to bear Offices. Never to make choice of such as are found either weak in Estate, Judgment, or suspected Fidelity. And he confirms his Assertion with impregnable Reasons.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:102167:70"/>Cursorily and methodically then to dilate on all these, with the inconveniences that usually befall in the Election of such as are lyable to any of those foresaid prejudices: In the first place, I cannot chuse but call to mind the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous confession of that faulty <hi>Pretorian,</hi> who being not onely accused, but impeached of sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry corrupt proceedings in the Execution of his Office, appear'd so unwilling to clear himself of those Crimes, whereof he was accused, as he freely acknowleged;
<q>That the <hi>Corruption,</hi> for which he became censur'd, sprung not from any <hi>depraved affection,</hi> but from the <hi>weakness</hi> of his <hi>condition,</hi> concluding; That he would have been honest enough, if his <hi>want</hi> had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him leave.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Those times, no doubt, resembled these we live in: Poverty was too low a step to raise any one to Preferment. The Court-gate was shut to them who knock'd with an empty hand: which our <note n="*" place="bottom">Camp. <hi>In Sylv.</hi>
               </note> Modern Poet wittily shadowed at, saying:
<q>
                  <l>Curia Pauperibus clausa est: Hic solus honores</l>
                  <l>Aulicus emeruit qui Satur aere fuit.</l>
                  <l>He that is poor</l>
                  <l>Must stand at Door</l>
                  <l>Though loyal to the King;</l>

                  <l>Swoln great by's Place,</l>
                  <l>May boldly enter in.</l>

            <p>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:102167:71"/>It is the property of these to make use of those old English Proverbs, <hi>By making Hay while the Sun shines</hi>: and <hi>Striking while the Iron is hot.</hi> Now, would you know from whence this intentiveness usually proceeds? This ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth from a jealousie they apprehend from their own Carriage: They fear the discovery of their actions: and consequently deprival of their Places; for <hi>depravation</hi> can expect no less than <hi>deprivation.</hi> This quickneth their endeavours in hope to be rich: and store their ravenous Nests with others Feathers. These be those <hi>Kings-fishers</hi> who prey both by Land and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. They take all for Fish that comes to Net: without sticking at small game before they stand out.</p>
            <p>And, whereas they are advertis'd by some of their <hi>Confidents</hi> (for these must have their <hi>Coys,</hi> or they shall play <hi>Bankrupts</hi> in their Office) that their reign is not likely to be long, in regard, the Eyes of those Counties, where they officiate, have taken Notice of their Shuffling: their one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way then to thrive, is, to play at <hi>Catch-doult,</hi> and to gather up his <hi>Crums</hi> before the <hi>Table</hi> be <hi>drawn</hi>: and so be call'd to Accompt, before he has had sufficient time, either to receive his full share, or discharge the <hi>Audit.</hi> But in these, as in Places of higher Command, and richer Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Those, who cordially wish their Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, apply this seasonable counsel to their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper'd

brains and occasional fears: present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after the full Receipts of their rackt Fees, or Commissionary Bribes, to make recourse to their Countrey House, and play least in sight; till the Storm be past, and the State-Inquisition run out of breath.</p>
            <p>But if they be found egregiously Criminal, they have Presidents in their Pockets, instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental enough for rebating the edge of Justice. It is not so long since but they can well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber (and may those Sanguinary times be ever ached in Rubrick Letters) how those plump Assassinats, who had inlarged their Babel Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings many Stories high upon our ruines, had mounted their <hi>Banks</hi> in forein Nations; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping by that means, if it should chance that times should change, and Rebellion fall from it self, to support their decays by those transport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but extorted treasures, which they had there imbursed: So wise was Treason in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding for its own supportance and security against a time of Extremity.</p>
            <p>But their <hi>Crocodile Eggs</hi> prov'd <hi>adle</hi>; and their <hi>Hatchers</hi> miserable: may the like Issue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall these indigent <hi>Corrupt Commissioners,</hi> who officiate onely for <hi>Self-interest,</hi> to the dishonour of their Soveraign, and prejudice of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>Neither can we less than doubt but that these <hi>close Pioneres</hi> of our State, by Plowing deep with
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:102167:72"/>
our own <hi>Heyfers,</hi> have been the occasion of sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Seed of Sedition in our late-imbroiled Nation.</p>
            <p>So dangerous it is to exasperate a Multitude in raising and levying <hi>Assesses</hi> (be they never so <hi>legal</hi>;) by prolling avaricious Officers, who make it their <hi>Vocation</hi> to abuse the Subject, to inrich themselves: and lay a Ground-work, by their seldom-thriving providence, for their suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, but successless Posterity. So quickly was the flame of their rising fortunes quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and to ashes <hi>pittilesly</hi> reduced.</p>
            <p>What fearful Consequences these <hi>Needful A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents</hi> have produc'd, Records in all times will manifest.</p>
            <p>High Taxes are sufficient foments to Division, without such offensive Instruments, who too often estrange stirring spirits from their Allege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
            <p>Neither be those to be made choice on for <hi>Commissioners,</hi> in raising, ordering, and collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of these Subsidies, or any dispensatory Act, who are of a <hi>weak</hi> or shallow <hi>Iudgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These may be Men of a good meaning, but wanting discretion to manage their meaning, they suffer themselves to be involved in many inextricable Windings, and gross Errors; which their easie apprehensions and indulgent hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours expose them to: being so unable to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion a Charge, as they usually lay the <hi>heaviest

load</hi> on the <hi>weakest back</hi>: all which they doe without the least intention of injury, but meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forth of ignorance, or simplicity: which might have been covertly, and without disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very shrouded, if their ambitious weakness could have been contented with privacy, and wisely retired from the pursuance of Publick imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <note n="*" place="bottom">Ambition cloathed with Ignorance, falls ever short of its Expectance.</note> For, as <hi>Preferment</hi> is the best <hi>Herald</hi> in displaying the temper of the enjoyer; so <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Ingagements</hi> discover best the abilities of the Undertaker.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Galba</hi> was held worthy of an Empire, till he became an Emperour: and <hi>Caelius</hi> to be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul, till he was made a Consul. We know not what men be, nor how they may prove, untill the <hi>Places,</hi> or <hi>Offices,</hi> whereto they are deputed, take off their <hi>Visards,</hi> and present them naked.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Divine Cynick,</hi> one no less <hi>wise</hi> than <hi>sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> being one day at a Feast (un-invited, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, for his inbred incivility rendred him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suitable for such Meetings) observing a Guest amongst the rest to sit silent, whil'st others ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd more free in their discourse; with a rough brow addressed his speech unto him in this manner:
<q>If Wise, thou art a Fool in hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy peace; If a Fool, thou art wise in holding it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Such Weaklings as these, who are of a <hi>Pen-feather'd
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:102167:73"/>
Iudgment,</hi> might make good use of this Observation: ever looking on <hi>Harpocrates</hi> Signe, with his finger on his mouth: For more Wisdom is shown in not speaking at all, than in speaking to no purpose. Of which <hi>impertinency</hi> we shall hear many of our <hi>Commissionary Rank</hi> highly conscious.</p>
            <p>This might be instanc'd in that ignorant <hi>Want-brain</hi>; who, assuming to himself the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Examining a <hi>Clark</hi> of the <hi>Market</hi> (an <hi>Office,</hi> doubtlessly, more <hi>abused</hi> than any other throughout the Kingdom) made this simple de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in a Publick Assembly,
<q>Whether by the vertue of his Office he was to weigh the <hi>Bakers</hi> bread by <hi>Troys Weight,</hi> or <hi>Haver de Poy?</hi>
               </q>
Whereto the Clark no less ingeniously answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
<q>Your Worship might as well ask me, why Broad Cloath should not be measur'd as well by the Bushel, as by the Yard.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Chusing of such <hi>Empty Casks,</hi> which sound <hi>lowdest</hi> when <hi>emptiest,</hi> redounds ever to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour of the Undertaker, the Scandal of the Preferrer, and Prejudice of all such as stand lya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the ignorance of their Censure. But to insist no longer on these, I am briefly to give a touch of a more dangerous and untunable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument, for the managery of State-Affairs, than either of the other. For, neither he whose <hi>Estate</hi> is <hi>indigent:</hi> Nor he who is of a <hi>weak</hi> and defective <hi>Iudgment,</hi> can possibly appear so fatal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:102167:73"/>
noxious in the blameless discharge of their Duties, as he who retains such a <hi>Coar</hi> in his <hi>heart,</hi> as it can afford no room to lodge <hi>Fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> in to his <hi>Prince.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the other two, as the one had more <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> than <hi>Honesty</hi>; the other more <hi>simple Honesty</hi> than <hi>prudent Policy</hi>: So he, whom we are now to speak of, and whom we are, like an imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Herald, to deblazon in his own native co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, is an Engine of Treachery.</p>
            <p>Under a fair and loyal Habit, he ever lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a <hi>Seianus</hi> spirit. He is never found fishing in calm Waters: being the onely <hi>Incendiary</hi> to blow the Coals of Division in every peaceable State.</p>
            <p>Neither is he onely treacherously Ambitious, but malitiously Envious.</p>
            <p>As one of these Seditious innovating spirits lately used one of his <hi>Fellow-Commissioners,</hi> far honester than himself, accusing him to be a <hi>Red-Letter'd</hi> Man, (meaning a <hi>Roman Catholick</hi>) and consequently incapable of any such Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But being brought to their Book by One discreeter than them both, they were so equally learn'd, as neither of them could distinguish a Red Letter from a Black.</p>
            <p>Howsoever, though some of these be no Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, they have designing Pates, apt to Mint and Mould Mischief to their future advantage, be the <hi>Ground-work</hi> never so <hi>Sandy</hi> whereon they build.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:102167:74"/>I shall not need to strengthen your opinion in this point with variety of Instances; we have had sufficient store hovering at our own Gates; the sad shares whereof, even to this day, appear in the ruines of many loyal Subjects.</p>
            <p>If we should sound these <hi>State-Whiflers</hi> to the bottom, (and no <hi>Inquisition</hi> more necessary) we might find them under the counterfeit pretence of loyal Service, from which their disjoynted affections have been long estranged, seemingly to bemoan the heavy condition of a Subject, and how compassionately They suffer'd in that behalf, seeing him crusht with the insupportable burden of his Pressures.</p>
            <p>And whereto tends all this, but to exasperate the Subject against his Soveraign: and under the colour of a gracious Commissioner, act the part of a graceless Traitor?</p>
            <p>All which, to trace the Observation of a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious and well-studied <hi>States-Man,</hi> occasional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ariseth from the security of a remiss, or liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Prince, who indulgeth his affections so much, as they beget in him a Lethargy to the Affairs of State: which might be instanc'd in <hi>Domitian, Vitellius,</hi> and <hi>Decian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereas Divine Providence has return'd us such a Prince, who by his vigilant inspection over his Military and Civil concerns, and time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remove of all such <hi>pernicious Instruments,</hi> as never ingaged for their Soveraign, yet had so
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:102167:74"/>
much impudence, as to expect Honours, with other advantagious helps, the least whereof they neither merited, nor by <hi>derserving Favourites</hi> pursued: Has hereby revived our late depressed Spirits, by shutting his Royal Gates of these <hi>abusive Court-ingles</hi>: and by consequence, his <hi>Highness,</hi> I say, has his loyal Subjects in their Primitive security, and his Sacred Person in a calm and peaceful safety.</p>
            <p>Such is the assured confidence of all <hi>loyal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi> whose known fidelity can abide the <hi>touch,</hi> and whose integrity never incurred <hi>taint.</hi> Nor can it be imagined, much less feared, but that the royal gratitude of so <hi>gracious a Master</hi> will amply gratifie their gallant Service, who have ingaged their Lifes, Freedoms, and Fortunes in defence of his Cause, and Preservation of his Person. So as those treacherous <hi>Assassins</hi> could not be more mischievous in plotting his ruine, than Sacred Providence appear'd each where propitious, in preparing an <hi>Hollow Oak</hi> for his Shelter, in a time of necessity: but <hi>loyal Hearts</hi> to succour in his height of extremity. Which gracious and unexemplary Deliverance, may it be writ with the Point of a Diamond in the Memories both of Prince and People; that our <hi>Thankfullness</hi> may never incurr an Act of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion to Posterity, for such a signal Evidence of Mercy.</p>
            <p>But leaving these dangerous <hi>Tetters</hi> which we
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:102167:75"/>
formerly touched, and wherewith Publick Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions have been usually tainted; holding them the <hi>refuse</hi> of a corrupt State, and as we ought, in an incapacity to any Magisterial Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; my conclusive Cloze shall be an Address to Your self, for whose use, in this Your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missionary Charge, I prepared these Advertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>Sir, It is well known to your Countrey, wherein you have shown your self an eminent and faithful Member, that you are liable to none of those <hi>Exceptions</hi> above-mention'd.</p>
            <p>For, in the <hi>First Place,</hi> your fulness of Estate has free'd you from being <hi>indigent</hi>; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently no way necessitated to take rewards.</p>
            <p>Nor by those excellent helps of your Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Natural Parts, so <hi>weak</hi> in <hi>Iudgment,</hi> as to appear ignorant of what you ought to do.</p>
            <p>Nor in the <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Loyalty</hi> so <hi>deficient,</hi> as to swerve the least Iota from your Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
            <p>Being thus furnish'd, what less can be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but that you will go on with honour: and to your Reputation hold that Dimension, as may suit with a Person of your Quality, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving Branch of your Family, by clearing your self from jealousie, and rendring content with all indearment to your Countrey?</p>
            <p>Neither is it sufficient to approve your self onely blameless in your own deportment, which
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:102167:75"/>
ought to be Exemplary: but to rectifie others of your Society, if in any point blame-worthy. For that <hi>Position</hi> will ever hold water:
<q>He, who holds in Competition, or stands joyntly impowr'd by Commission; and in that pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or equality of Command, understands his Fellow to be in the irregular course of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings an Offender; makes himself guilty of the Offence, if he act not by his best Endevour to reform that Error.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In a word, look on your <hi>Subsidy Men</hi> with an equal eye; the serious survey whereof will present an Act of Justice and Piety.</p>

            <head>A DEFENSIVE LETTER, IN VINDICATION OF HIS FRIENDS HONOVR: Occasioned upon our late ASSESSES.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Ame has been ever held of a more lavish tongue and swift wing, than just in her Relations: This I hope the World will find verifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in you. Your <hi>Countrey</hi> has made choice of you for her Patriot; do not betray her trust. Accompt it your highest Preferment,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:102167:77"/>
and without boasting, your prime glory, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the <hi>Conveniencies</hi> of your Countrey. And, to the end your knowing endeavours may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear more instrumental herein, take an exact survey of the accomodations and advantages properly conducing to that <hi>County, Burrough,</hi> or <hi>Mannor,</hi> whereof you stand elected, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted an assistant Member.</p>
            <p>Neither is it onely to fall into your conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, how, by your discreet addresses, you may advance the interests of that Place for which you stand ingaged, nay Conscientiously obliged; but, how you may by a prudent and provident inspection avoid all obstructive wayes that shall occasion any dis-advantage in the improvement of it.</p>
            <p>This should be the constant Task of all your <hi>fellow Consuls,</hi> whose study ought not to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed about fishing in <hi>troubled waters,</hi> as our Factious-fiery Spirits are usully affected: whose frisking humours hunt onely after a <hi>Change</hi>: making it the least of their care, or fear, if the <hi>State</hi> became a <hi>Bedlam,</hi> so it were an <hi>House</hi> of their <hi>Foundation</hi>; or a Political dis-joynted <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> of their own <hi>Constitution.</hi> Nor like <hi>Court-Fauns,</hi> complying with the Current of the time: and making <hi>Self-ends</hi> their primary designs.

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:102167:77"/>
Eminent Favourites. Countrey relations, with whatsoever is held most dear to conscientious Men, must fall under the Grand Inquisition; or what is worse, incurr that <hi>Epidemical prejudice</hi> to all Royalists, a perpetual <hi>Act of Oblivion.</hi> Preferments are personal concerns, and must take place before Countrey Debates, or Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Interests, else must these Cabinet Agents, who officiate for themselves, lose by the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
            <p>Dear Friend, our long acquaintance, second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with such mutual regreets, have deeply in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd me to the precious tender of your repute. Some will not stick to say, that your Name is in the <hi>Class</hi> of those <hi>Court-shadows</hi>: and the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sute after Honour has made you forget the <hi>Place</hi> from whence you came, or the <hi>Errand</hi> for which you were sent. Trust me, I should rather wish you dead to Earth, than live to such Fame. But, I hope, the World does bely you, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise shall the world make me a stranger to you.</p>
            <p>Dead Flyes corrupt the precioust Ointments: and vicious Agents are fatally noxious to the best imployments. Therefore was it antiently observed in the <hi>Athenian</hi> State, that none were to be Elected one of the <hi>Ephori,</hi> a Place of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sular Dignity, unless he were a Person of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>question'd fame, and whose eyes were shut from rewards, or admiring Greatness. It is not long since (for we retein yet the scarrs of those Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:102167:78"/>
wounds and Warrs amongst us) your self was inrowled a Martial Commander in His de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, to whom we owe our Allegeance. In which service, what clear evidences of your prowess and valour were manifested to the World, I shall, as one known to your native Modesty, be sparing to relate; leaving it to the attest of your Countrey, where your actions purchas'd that surviving glory. Onely let me put you in mind of that Morning <hi>Canto,</hi> which, amidst all your dangers and disasters, you so cheerfully breathed.</p>
            <q>
               <l>The rising Sun shines gracefully on me,</l>
               <l>Because a Subject sworn to Loyalty.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Now, upon what grounds could it be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, how the gallantry of such an active spirit should so eagerly nibble at the light bait of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding honour, or the deceiving hope of Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which generally begets more Foes than Friends, and in the end leaving the Projector weary of his purchase, renders him a spectacle of scorn to his sleighted Family?</p>
            <p>Let us search the <hi>Records</hi> of all such Men as have taken their rise by indirect wayes in these State-Assemblies! we may, perchance, find them, like <hi>Isis</hi> Ass, loaden with Honour; so richly has their <hi>Complyance</hi> with Persons of Place gilded their <hi>New foundations,</hi> for moulding,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:102167:78"/>
or advancing pernicious Designs. But mark the issue of these timing Wits, with the usual Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastrophe that attends them! They fall into such contempt by the purchase of their Merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and Immerited Honour, as they are usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entertained by their abused Countrey, in stead of applause and approbation, with scorn and derision.</p>
            <p>Hence it was, that the <hi>Stoick</hi> accompted the <hi>Lackquey</hi> more happy than his <hi>Master</hi> that road on his foot-Cloath. Though the one be fuller of State, the other rests more secure. For the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er stands ever most exposed to danger. In pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick imployments (if his abilities ingage his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance in them) his actions become liable to censure: wherein, if any Proposal, or definite conclusion appear out of square, the Instrument must be question'd. Admit it be never so light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly devious, it must undergo the test.</p>
            <p>And though formal in most, if defective in one, a severe interpretation will accompany it. One drop of <hi>Coloquintida</hi> will spoil a whole Pot of Pottage. Especially in Publick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns; where the voice of the People sounds loud.</p>
            <p>Every <hi>Tax,</hi> or <hi>Assess,</hi> becomes their <hi>Phlebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomist</hi>; extracting blood from their veins: and native heat from the vital parts.</p>
            <p>One small Chick snatcht by the Kite, begets more passion in a Pesant, than the loss of an

herd of Cattel suffer'd by a Community. This Individual Man, as he is his own Sharer, so in his suffrings he finds no equal Partner. Of others wounds nor wrongs he has no resentment, so he injoy his own welfare and freedom. But when not onely one limb, but the whole Body Politick groans under a burden of suitable na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it acts in the sufferers a communicable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper. Then, like our quaking Separatists<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they find out retiring Places to vent their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents in. Then they discover their Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ballanc'd with their insupportable pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures: but principally their joynt practises, how they might inflict due revenge (so impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable is popular fury) upon the <hi>Designers</hi> of their sufferings: who, no doubt, if they should fall into their clutches, would expect no better usage than <hi>Absyrtus</hi> receiv'd from the remorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less hands of <hi>Medea,</hi> to be rent piece-meal. Nor than, that cunning, but cruel Artist, in that Tyrannick reign of <hi>Phalaris,</hi> who command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the <hi>Inventor</hi> should be first tortur'd in his own <hi>Engine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Just it is, that those whose onely study is Complacency: and whose supreme ends are self-ends, should close their dayes in misery, weaving up their Comical Court-Jubile in an Epilogue; breathing nothing but disconsolate ayrs of an ensuing Tragedy. Such was the fate of <hi>Philotas</hi>: and may the like Issue personat

the constant office of an <hi>Vsher</hi> to every Court-Sycophant: who, under a seeming pretence of feeding the Exchequer, starves the State.</p>
            <p>It is observ'd how that insinuating Favourite of <hi>Vespasian,</hi> having closely whisper'd into the Emperours eares, what vast advantage that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming Tax of <hi>Vrin-Money</hi> would bring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Coffers; as one whose minde was natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly addicted to a pursute of profit: He hugged his design, promising him an ample Reward for his ingenious contrivance of so useful a way (a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>track never trod before) for inhancing the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues of his Treasury. But, afterwards ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertis'd, how this <hi>Claw-Back</hi> pursu'd his own Interest, making it his endeavour to become <hi>Contractor</hi> for that Grand Imposition, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently not onely abuse the Subject, but cheat the Emperour; his hateful Projections brought him into such general contempt, as he was not onely discarded the Court, where he had such eminent reception: but in his Countrey too, where he had forfeited his Reputation: being not onely scorn'd, but houted at, and Stigma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd with this Mark of distinction: <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Ecce quàm fastuosè &amp; fastidiosè</hi> Vespasiani <hi>lasanum prodit!</hi>

               <hi>Behold how proudly and hatefully that Piss-pot of</hi> Vespasian <hi>struts along!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sundry instances of this ungracious kind might be found, both in our own time, and <hi>Climes,</hi> who appear'd eminent Ornaments in the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:102167:80"/>
Seats of Justice, in their Countrey; but, no sooner call'd up by Publick Votes, to do their Prince and Countrey Service, than a Surrepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious hope of Preferment made them forgetful of their just imployment; by playing the <hi>Crick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets,</hi> and hatching their <hi>Crocodile Eggs</hi> in Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney Corners; and Moulding <hi>Strange Assesses</hi> to dis-gust the People, for their own interest.

Asper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions thrown upon our Politick and Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick Government, without ground: Nothing desired by them, that may conduce to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good; but by his <hi>Majesty</hi> with much alacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty seconded. So as, unless a Well-Planted, and long-flourishing Monarchy should be reduc'd to an Aristocracy, or which is more to be fear'd, an absolute Anarchy; What could be with more facility inclin'd to, to satisfie the Votes and Voices of a <hi>small remainder:</hi> who seem rather to stand upon singularity of Opinion, than ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of their Countreys honour? What Miseries these wofull Distractions have brought to our State, there is no eye, unless prejudicate, but apparently sees, and seeing suffers. This, even many of those who nearliest sided with them, have lately observed, and so sensibly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended; as they have interceded an <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation:</hi> wherein, perceiving an averse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in some few <hi>Parliamentaries,</hi> (and those
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:102167:81"/>
who have run so deep an hazard upon his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Displeasure, as they find themselves hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, by their Disloyal and Malapert passages, to recover their impeach'd honour) They have since wholly declin'd from adhering to them: and, with a Zealous Loyalty, applyed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to his Majesties Commands: with a reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute desertion of all such, whose Propositions trenched upon such desperate ends. Besides, the very <hi>City,</hi> which has been the <hi>Parliaments</hi> Exchequer, has of late, upon Maturer Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, withdrawn their Contribution; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving clearly, how it neither suited with their Profit nor Honour; but the utter ruine and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of both together.</p>
            <p>Now, if you reserve your Eye for <hi>Events</hi>; excepting these late <note n="*" place="bottom">Relating to those late <hi>Parliamentary</hi> Imbroilments.</note> 
               <hi>Lancashire</hi> Defeats, you shall see their <hi>York-shire</hi> Forces defeated and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed; Or, if you will look nearer the Sun, you shall collect, by a more just and credible discovery, than any <hi>Diurnal</hi> Relation, (which, for the <hi>Stationers</hi> Profit, and <hi>Parliamentaries</hi> Credit, becomes generally a Mint of untruths, and unjustificable fictions) how his Majesties Forces daily increase, and the Parliaments de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease: So, as now, success begins to smile upon the Justness of his Cause.</p>
            <p>Dear Sir, with an unequal and uninteressed eye fix upon these: suffer your self to be unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived;
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:102167:82"/>
and compose the residue of your Resolves to such fair and noble Presidents, whose timely aversion from pertinacy, and conversion to Loyalty, have begot them esteem; to their States and Persons safety: those individual fruits of Allegiance and Fidelity.

            <head>THE INTEREST OF WEST MERLAND.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His <hi>County</hi> stands highly inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to her own Interest: a People frugal and tenacious: naturally inclined to Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry; which may be an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of Her Frugality; made good by that <hi>Italian</hi> Maxim,
<q>That which we get with our own hands, we ever forego with heavy hearts.</q>
Hence it is, that there is no way readier to ingratiate their <hi>Commonty,</hi> than to claw them with an opinion of moderating their Charge: or declining the face of hostility with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cost.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:102167:91"/>They are infinitely sensible of the emptying of their own <hi>pail,</hi> be they never so lightly milkt. For the <hi>Publick,</hi> it is a Star of such a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnitude above them, or distance from them, that albeit they derive all their light from that Orbe; yet so individually cemented are these to their own, as they hold the Publick profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or deficience, smally concerns them. A little Tax foments such distaste, as it operates more violently upon the pulse of their spirit, than a precipice of the whole State. (The Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sants and Plebeians we onely hint at) for the <hi>Gentry</hi> are generally of that clear and candid nature, and grounded on such <hi>loyal Principles,</hi> as might be instanced in those sad-wasting times of our late distractions, where it was observed, that never any of <hi>Quality,</hi> within the whole <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rony,</hi> was ever known to take up Arms against his Sacred Majesty; or, for their own security, contract with an Associate County.</p>
            <p>This County consists of two sorts; and in these two, dissorted into different opinions. The <hi>Gentry</hi> and <hi>Commonty.</hi> For <hi>Nobility,</hi> some an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Structures she reteins, as Monuments, or Trophies of their owners quality; but either by the irrevocable decree of fate, or deplorable vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of their faith, they are divided from their Countrey; leaving onely those main and massy piles for <hi>Land-marks,</hi> or aged reliques of their pristine Magnificence and Glory. The <hi>Gent.</hi> here,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:102167:91"/>
are generally well-bred; though in times of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction, more apt to Command than to be obey'd. There is nothing that begets more breaches in their Society, nor discords in their harmony, than that deluding bait of populari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: Which puts me in mind of that State-axiom,
<q>He cannot be justly regular, that desires to be popular.</q>
Self-opinion, drawn from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of their own worth, or a reflexion to their Family or Birth, become inducements ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times to ambitious and elated spirits, to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with Authority:
<q>For a supposed parity, cannot brook priority.</q>
This makes Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions concluded in the Evening, to lose their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour and validity in the Morning. While the distasted precedency of the person, not the ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality of the proposition, occasions this oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.</p>
            <p>This County holding such gradual distance from the Sun; I mean, the face of the Court; has been in publick Assemblies, where the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of Counties was debated, and with great deliberation carefully secured; as an inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable place, dis-regardfully sleighted; nothing in it worthy to be valued: it was left to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it self, or suffer: The Sun shining then in a clear Zodiack, would not dart one small beam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on her. Yet, it is admirable to observe, how this obscure and deserted Angle, in times of greatest distemper; even then, when men, and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:102167:92"/>
all things so miserably jarring, had seem'd to change their nature; stood ever firm, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable in her fidelity; and resolute in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning those assassinate braves and threats of a confining Enemy. Besides, never did <hi>County,</hi> to her succeeding glory, in testimony of her Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, open her bosom more freely to return ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitality to such, as were pursued by the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>
            <p>Being a <hi>Nook,</hi> in comparison of other Shires; yet One of the very last Counties that veil'd to their over-powerful Enemy: and upon such Signal Conditions, as, that <hi>Foe</hi> to <hi>Fidelity</hi> could not glory much in the purchase of his Mercena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and ignominious victory.</p>
            <p>And, to give a further addition to their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>question'd valour and renown, it has been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, how at that time, when that <hi>Handfull of Men</hi> (being held a narrow and inconsiderate County) spit defiance in the face of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; making this their constant Impreze: <hi>IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TACTA EST</hi> WESTRIA <hi>VIRGO</hi>; Which, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without derogation to their <hi>Honour</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>subdu'd,</hi> or rather compounded with to lay down their Arms) They changed into this: <hi>VITIATA EST</hi> WESTRIA <hi>VIRGO.</hi> Which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected, but necessitated Overture, wrought such distempers upon some of their <hi>Commanders</hi>; as they could not endure to remain any longer in those polluted <hi>Nests,</hi> wherein such <hi>Ravenous
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:102167:92"/>
Fowls</hi> pretended an <hi>Interest.</hi> Mean time, those loyal-hearted Souldiers left behind, though dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfited, they were not discouraged; for, though the insulting Enemy was more in number, They never durst incounter them without great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, such was their valour.</p>
            <p>It has been reported, that even at such time as those late Malignants, who bounded near her, and by a daily recruit of their numerous For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, might probably perplex her; when their powers increased, and their Victories vain-glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously dispersed; yet, the very Colonels, and chief Commanders of their Enemies Faction seriously interceded their Association; so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable was the prowess of this small County to a populous Army, a victorious Enemy. Yet could neither Promises nor Menaces make a breach upon that impregnable Fortress of their Loyalty. They disclaimed all concurrence with State-competitors: when Crowns and Scepters lay at Stake; they neither held it safe, nor ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, to admit least acquiescence, much less adherence to such fomenters of debate. This enforced the Enemy to stand continually upon his Guard, to his great disadvantage: which, though it injoyned this County to a constant charge, yet it conduced highly to their safety, and preservation of their honour. Howbeit, some scattered aspersions have lately spread themselves; which, at the first blush, may seem
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:102167:93"/>
to some prejudicate opinions, detractive from the reputation of this County: but upon more mature and serious discussion of every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar (though my Person be a stranger to those Parts, which may imply an impartial Pen) I have heard it amply debated, and unanimously concluded, that no action was committed, nor design omitted, that might any way derogate from their Honour: for, by labouring to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize an Enemy, as was apparently proved, they might, at that time, have made way for the Enemy to seize upon the Rendevouz for that County; which would not have been so easily repriz'd, being once possessed; by reason of the Inhabitants within it, and places adjacent to it; whose affections were dangerously corrupted.</p>
            <p>It was held by an excellent refined judgment, for a <hi>gallant action,</hi> if they could decline the fury of a powerful neighbouring Enemy, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out forein Protection: which, by their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders care, hath been bravely performed: crowning the issue of their actions with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted resolution.</p>
            <p>The Souldiers, who are designed to keep Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison in these Parts, are Men of proper Perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, and strong Constitutions: and, no doubt, of stout and resolute Courage, if they were put to it. But, their near adjoyning service to their own doors, makes them more remiss in their attendance. This Opinion has been gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:102167:93"/>
retein'd of them:
<q>Better Souldiers, if they were well disciplin'd, and farther di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanc'd from home, never March'd into any Field: but their thought of home, and a neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected Family, makes them less intentive to Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs Military.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This Shire is divided into two parts; but the <hi>Baronry</hi> is the Beauty and Glory of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for her more civiliz'd Commonty. For the other part of the County, their Commons are more servile, but less civil: and, to the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their Commanders, not so ready to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, as to obey. Whereto, they have been so inured from their infancy; as Obedience is more acceptable to them than Soveraignty.</p>
            <p>The Shire-Town is <hi>Apleby,</hi> which merits pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence onely for antiquity: for <hi>Kendall,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Garrison-Town for the County, has been ever renowned for her affluence of commerce, and confluence of People: Being a <hi>Burgess</hi> high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fam'd for her <hi>Manufactory</hi> in <hi>Woolwork</hi>: which, by their experienc'd industry, became infinitely commodious to the <hi>Corporation</hi> and Parts adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent: though of late much decreasing. Which, it were to be wish'd, that it might be timely sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, and cheerfully reviv'd, by the assistance and application of those Members in the High Court of Parliament, who stand obliged, upon their Election, to promote the <hi>Interests</hi> of their Countrey; by removing all probable occurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:102167:94"/>
that may obstruct the improvement of it. An imployment, no doubt, more corresponsive to their Place, whereto they are, by the Votes and Voices of their Countrey, deputed; than any <hi>Self-seeking-Interest,</hi> wherewith, I hope, that sharp <hi>Northern ayr</hi> will not suffer them to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. Neither has it been the least of her hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, to have enjoyed such loyal and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect <hi>Magistrates</hi>; as by their vigilancy and fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, made it their prime terrestrial task, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercept these Enemies of the State. Such Centi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels deserve cherishing, and high approvement; especially in these times so anxiously shaking and shuddring. Neither can too much circumspecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be used, in regard of the Dis-affectionates in that Place; their private desertion of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Cause; and their aversion from all accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation or intention to Peace. The beauty of <hi>Sodoms</hi> Aples was onely in their colour: and, the purity of these, onely in their tinsell-zeal lustre. Their seeming compliance in the Cause, cannot palliat the Core of their heart. Sin ever retains the sting of shame: Neither can it be such a faithful Secretary to it self, but it must, when least expected, and less importuned, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover its guilt.</p>
            <p>Many private passages present admittance to this Town of Garrison: but, no <hi>In-lets</hi> more dangerous than <note n="*" place="bottom">Pretending Zealots, the mainest Fomenters of Rebellion: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating ever to our late distracted times.</note> 
               <hi>ill-hearts,</hi> where the poyson of
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:102167:94"/>
dis-affection has instill'd that infusion, as, no spirit holds more influence over some pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Zelots of them, than that viperous fury of Rebellion. Well may the <hi>Malignants</hi> promise to themselves a grateful harvest to their Labours, when they plough their accursed Ground with their Enemies Heifers. But, these <hi>Brambles</hi> are not so many, but they might be quickly Weed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, did not Impunity thaw Authority; and leave Delinquents more presumingly indurate.</p>
            <p>Sundry Forts, Rampires, and Barricadoes have been in the most convenient and incursive places lately erected, by the care of those Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours successively imployed in Garrison: amongst which, One of principal concernment, being an antient artificial Mount, and in form resembling one of those <hi>Pyrenaean</hi> Mountains, dividing <hi>France</hi> from <hi>Spain</hi>; and distinguished by a Device or Model, like a Cap of Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, upon the top: a Work, certainly, of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable art, ingenuity and consequence. This stands as a Counter-mure, by an equal le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, and opposal to the Castle; which Castle, though ruinous and demolished, is shortly to be Fortified, if all designs proceed, as are intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But, now those hopes of reparation have run themselves quite out of breath: Peace and Unity being the safest Ports, and securest Forts that Human Policy can erect.</p>

               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:102167:95"/>In a word, if this County be at unity within it self, it will prove a grievous Eye-sore to the strongest Assailant: neither can this Sacred Chain of Union be dissolved but by two means: First, By a surreptitious Envy, fomented in some of the <hi>Gentry,</hi> towards the Persons that are in Command: Or, this particular respect in the <hi>Commonty</hi> (a too Epidemical Malady) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in private gain must over-ballance the Publick good. To cure these, no Receipt more sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain, than, in the first place, for the <hi>Gentry,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reluctancy, or private agency, to submit their Wills to the fair Commands of those, who derive from their Superiours a legal preceden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: And, in the next place, for the <hi>Commonty</hi> to decline their own opinion, and, to adhere wholly to their <hi>Commanders</hi>; by whose advice, they may not onely be regulated, wherein their own discretion cannot supply them; But so compleatly furnished, as timely prevention, the life of Policy, may hereafter secure them.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Cunning cautelous People; Patient of Labour; and plyable to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands: Which observance in them, is rather to be imputed to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet carriage of their Gentry, than the innate affection, or disposition of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monty. Who, if a prudent awe did not subdue them, could be easily induced to play the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters. Neither was it possible for them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine so long upon a subtile neighbouring Nation, but they must necessarily receive some tincture from them, and retein it in them. They are pithy in their discourse, and nimble in their bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaining. Antiently, this County, as our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:102167:96"/>
was, has been much ingaged to <note n="*" place="bottom">The <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> Foundation of a Tenant-Right.</note> 
               <hi>Border service</hi>: in the pursute whereof, by freedom of booties, it returned generally more gainer than loser.</p>
            <p>The Gentry of this County has been ever much addicted to Recreation; as Hunting, Hawking, Horse-races, and the like gentile plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures. Now, by the late breaking in of these Distractions and uncivil quarrels, to their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, they address'd their imployments wholly to the Discipline of Armes. Many of these have received several Commands; some of Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, others of Colonies, and others of select quality, of Brigades. Certain differences (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the prevalency of some dis-affected spirits, who itched after nothing more than Innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) sprung up dangerously in the beginning: but, the <hi>Serpent</hi> was nipt in the head: and the <hi>Gockatrice</hi> broken in the egg, before it was hatched. Some dangerous Instruments we have obviously heard of in our travel to those parts; who were, by their peculiar Places and Offices, highly interessed in the Counties Affairs; and these, to the great dishonour of their Place and Person, made Marchandize of their Offices: pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the receipt of a sordid servile profit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the estimation of their Family, conscience or credit. <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> would have smoak'd such mercenary venders of smoke. <hi>Xerxes</hi> would have pulled their skin over their eares. But,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:102167:96"/>
this official corruption is such a contagion, as it cannot conceal its poyson. The <hi>Partridge</hi> is said to make her nest of stoln Egges, which she hath not layed; but, as soon as the Birds are hatched, the true Mother calls them all away from their theevish step-Dame; the Story needs no <hi>Oedipus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The prime Seat, or Garrison for this County, is <hi>Carlisle</hi>; a dainty, free and fertile soyl. Yet, either through sloath of the Inhabitants, or some other occult cause (notwithstanding the delicacy and fruitfulness of the Seat) the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are generally poor and necessitous: pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring a sleepy supine life, before any industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous gain.</p>
            <p>Their near adjacency to that disloyal and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful People, the <hi>Scots,</hi> with their constant Traffick and commerce with them, has begot in some of them, too near a congruence, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence in their affections. Hence it is, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse Factious Separatists, who desire nothing more than Division, or rather a privation in all Government; have familiarly repaired to those parts, and freely, no doubt, communicated to them their counsels. So dangerous is the stream of dis-allegeance, when it interveines it self in any descending line of blood, or to use their own word for it, of <hi>Clan.</hi> And, as the Snow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball gathers by rowling: so These, by pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plausive ends, many times find Assistants
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:102167:97"/>
and ready Agents to further their Designs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Religion</hi> is a specious pretence; but, for illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate and undisciplinary Persons to be reducers and reformers of a long-establish'd Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and, to find <hi>false wards</hi> in that <hi>Key,</hi> which has so freely and fruitfully opened the door, for so many Ages, to People of all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions: it is such an Anathematiz'd Doctrine, as he that inclines to it, cannot but acknowledg himself miserably deluded.</p>
            <p>To labour a seasonable prevention of these, it was the especial care of the Gentry of both Counties, to levy their Forces timely, and by applying a present Remedy, to decline an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching Malady. In this, they all concurred, and happily succeeded. For, upon the very first appearance of Force, these groundless Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants had the Manners to lay down their Arms, and to embrace Loyalty. So easily were they to be reclaimed, whom lightness of opinion had so weakly ensnared: and a precipitate assent to indiscreet counsel, so unadvisedly perswaded.</p>
            <p>Yet, for all this, no Vintage so carefully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, but some Clusters will be left ungather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; no Harvest so painfully earned, but some Eares left ungleaned: though the main Fabrick were demolished, there appeared some Refuse, or Rubbish, arising from those Ruines, which might supply fresh Materials to erect a new Pile of mischief, if it were not prevented.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:102167:97"/>The opinion which is held of the <hi>Agent,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his designs aym at Loyalty, or dis-Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, works wonderful impressions: This might be collected by the passages of one Gentleman, too deeply interested in these Civil Divisions: whose moral honesty had so possest him of a good opinion generally, as his precipicious actions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the better construction, by means of this opinion. It is true; that our best Men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deluded, and imployed upon ill business, do ever the worst Offices. A debaucht Slave, who has sold himself to all impiety, can never find many Favourites, nor Followers; unless they be such as are casten in the same Mould: Civil reserved Men, who carry their eyes about them, will be jealous of the Design, by reason of the Agent. <hi>Catiline</hi> may find a <hi>Cethegus</hi>; but, to see him associated, either by a <hi>Cato,</hi> or a <hi>Brutus,</hi> were a miracle. Let evil Men then be put upon ill actions: for, when good Men are seen in them, or consort with those that appear for them; they attract many Shadows; and make those practises, which in their own native Simples, are poysonous, seem to deluded judgments, who are mis-led, by their opinion of the Agents, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial and commodious. We shall not need here to distinguish Him by any nearer or clearer Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter: the knowledg of his <note n="*" place="bottom">A Gentleman highly valued for his discreet Government in those times.</note> Person has aspired to that growth with most men in those Parts; as these may present him in his full body, without
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:102167:98"/>
any farther discovery. It were to be wished, that, as mis-understanding has seduced him, so some clear, solid, and dis-ingaged judgment may reduce him; which by these calmer times has been effected: rendring him both morally and conscientiously Loyal. But, we have retraited too farr from the <hi>Interess</hi> of this County.</p>
            <p>Their Shire-Town is strongly fortified; with useful Ordnance furnished: and by an experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced Governour <note n="*" place="bottom">If a precipicious Passion, or an impropriation to opinion transport him not; whereto maturity of time, advice, and long experience, have seasonably made him a stranger.</note> Commanded: So, as though the continual attendance of Troops of Horse, and maintenance of a constant Garrison, may appear a burden to the County: yet, in regard of the vicinity of the Enemy, who is apt to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain all opportunate advantages of hostility, this charge becomes their Sanctuary.</p>
            <p>Nor is it to be omitted, what Zeal their <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate,</hi> with other Countrey Officers, have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed to the Publick Cause; and in it, how they have manifested their affections to such, who had deserted their Countrey, by bogling at Authority: labouring to reduce them by gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulatory Letters, and Messages of Amity; but, see the ingratitude of <hi>Malignants!</hi> So far were they from being perswaded, as these honest Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers were, by them, uncivilly answered; twit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with the vices wherewith they had
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:102167:98"/>
known them formerly to be acquainted: Wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of them to look to his <hi>Wench</hi>; another to his <hi>Bribe</hi>: and to leave them to their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.</p>
            <p>To conclude this, let us reflect upon their Quality, and Harmony in Commands. Although they have a <hi>Commander</hi> in <hi>Chief,</hi> designed over both the Counties: who, out of his candor and affability, is pleased, in all freedom and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity to communicate his Counsels to them; yet some resulting spirits there have been, who vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much from the antient <hi>Israelites</hi> disgust: for, their desire pitched upon this, to have a Strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Ruler over them; rather than One who was Born and Bred among them. But, so equally were his thoughts composed, as by none of these affronts could he suffer himself to be distemper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; seeing, it fares generally with the most Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Agent, or any other active Instrument of State, as it does with a Prophet, not to be esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his own Countrey.</p>
            <p>It was an excellent observation of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionate <hi>Roman,</hi> touching <hi>Scipio African</hi>:
<q>O what a gallant General were <hi>African,</hi> if he were in any Countrey but his own! But, brave actions, grounded upon pure intentions, cannot lose their guerdon.</q>
The Sun, after it has wrastled with a Cloud, shews his beauty in more fullness. For, the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the <hi>Gentry</hi> become more clear than
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:102167:99"/>
they were, being wonn by their <hi>Commanders</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fability, his infatigable care for the Publick, his dis-regard to his own profit.</p>
