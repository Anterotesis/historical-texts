            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

To all them that either reade or heare gods holy worde / and geue ouer them ſelues to lyue vnfan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly acording to the ſame / do I hartely wyſſhe the grace / peace and mercy of god the father in and thorow oure lorde and one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sauioure Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</head>
            <p>THe ſeuenth daye of Decembre / was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyuered vnto me a certayne treatyſe / compo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſed by one Iohn Standiſh Felow of Whitting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton college in londo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (ſo is the tytle of it) and pryn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted by Robert Redeman / Anno M. D. XL. iij. Nonas Octobris. At the reading wherof I mourned ſore within my ſelfe for certayne oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions offred vnto me in the ſande treatyſe. Firſt that vnder the Kynges priuilege any thing ſhuld be ſet forth / which is either agaynſt the worde and trueth of allmightye god / or agaynſt the Kyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges honoure. Secondlye / that good / wholſome / and Chriſten wordes ſhulde be calumpniated and reuyled. Thirdly / that the ſayde Iohn Standiſh pronouncyng Doctoure Barnes to haue taught hereſye ſo longe / is not aſhamed all this whyle to haue hold his penne / but now firſt to wryte a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt him / whan he is deed. et ce.</p>
            <p>As touching the firſt / whether I haue cauſe to mourne or no / I reporte me to all true Chriſten hertes. for (as I am credibly enfourmed / <note place="margin">Diuerſyte amonge wry<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ters.</note> and as I partly haue ſene) there is now a wonderful diuerſite in writing bokes and balates in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
<pb facs="tcp:9769:3"/>
/ one enueyenge agaynſt another / one reuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linge and reprouyng another / one reioyſinge at anothers fall and aduerſite. And not onely this / but alſo at the ende of euery balate or boke in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner (whether it be the better partye or worſe) is ſet the Kynges priuilege. Which as it is aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynſt the glorye of god that one ſhulde reuyle ano<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther / Is it not euen ſo agaynſt the Kynges ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noure (Yee the ſhame is it of all Englande) that vnder his priuilege anye erroneous / conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious / or ſlaunderous boke or papyre ſhulde be prynted? Men wonder in other contrees / that ther is ſo greate negligence of this matter / in a realme where ſo wyſe and prudent a counſail is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And they that are moued with godly compaſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / do lament Englande. ſory / that ther is ſo great diſcencion in it.<note place="margin">Tryfles are prynted with the Kynges priuilege / vnknowing to him.</note> ſory / that blaſphemous ieaſting / and raylinge balates or bokes agaynſt the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt worde of god / ſhulde either be ſuffred or priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legied. ſory / that gods trueth ſhulde thus ſpiteful<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly be intreated of ſo greate a nombre. Now the reformacion of this and all other defaultes lyeth onely in the hande of god / To whom I referre it / and to the rightfull admyniſtracion of his holy ordinau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and auctorite in the kynges hyghneſſe. who / whan he knoweth of the ſaide inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce (how tryflinge and raylinge bokes and rymes are prynted vnder his priuilege) wyll no doubte ſet a redreſſe herein.</p>
            <p>Concernyng the ſeconde occaſion aboue rehear<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ced
<pb facs="tcp:9769:3"/>
Is it not cauſe ynough forme and all other Chriſten / to be right ſory / to mourne and lamen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te / that the wordes which are good / wholſome / and acordinge to the holy ſcripture and Chriſies faith / ſhulde be either blaſphemed or taken to the worſt? Yf the Kynges grace / ſhulde put forthe an wholſome proclamacion / iniunction or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement (as he doth many) what true ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecte louynge gods holy ordinaunce and auctori<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te in his prynce / wold not be greue to ſe anye man either ſpytt at thoſe his ſoueraignes wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des / or to defye them? Yf we now which are Chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſten / haue ſo iuſt occſion (and are bownde) to be thus wiſe mynded in this outward regiment / wherein god hath appoynted us to be obedient to the hyer powers / how much more cauſe haue we to water our eyes with ſory hertes / whan the pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>clamacion / iniunction / <note place="margin">Good wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des are blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed.</note> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de of him which is kyng of all Kynges and lord of all lordes / is thus reuyled and euell ſpoken of? That the wordes of. D. Barnes ſpoken at tbe houre of his death / and here vnder written / are good / wholſome / acording to gods holy ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re / and not worthy to be euell taken / It ſhalbe eui<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dently ſene / whan we haue layed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the twych ſtone / and tryed them by gods worde. To the open text wherof yf ye take good hede / ye ſhal ſe the peruerſe doctryne and wycked opynions of Standiſh clerely confuted. And (no doubte) god wyll ſo haue it / becauſe that vnder the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence

of bearing a zeale toward gods worde / he taketh apon him to be iudge and geuer of ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce agaynſt gods worde / and to condemne it that gods worde aloweth.</p>
            <p>And this (as I ſayde) is another cauſe of the ſoryneſſe of my hert / that he which darre auo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we another man to be an ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heretike / is not aſha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>med thus longe nether to haue written / ner open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preached agaynſt him by name / but now to ſtarte vp whan he is deed.

Yet were it as charitable a dede to confute all treaſon and to geue us warnynge of it by name / as either to eſtabliſhe falſe doctryne / or to enueye agaynſt good ſayenges.

He that wolde wryte agaynſt anye man / ſhulde le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell his ordinaunce agaynſt his euell wordes (yf he had ſpoken or written anye) and not agaynſt his good wordes. ffor god is the authoure of all good / which as his holy ſcripture aloweth / ſo will he himſelfe defende the ſame. He that is ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an enemye to the thinge which is good / or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth it / is gods aduerſary / and withſtondeth him. Wherfore let Standiſh fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> henſforth and all other beware / <note place="margin">Let no man take parte agaynſt the trueth.</note> that they take no parte agaynſt gods worde / ner defende any falſe matter / leſt god be the auenger. ffor yf the lyon begynne to roare / he will make all his enemies afrayed.</p>
            <p>And yf. D. Barnes dyed a true Chriſten man / be ye ſure / his death ſhalbe a greater ſtroke to ypocriſye / then euer his life coulde haue bene. Yf he was falſly accuſed to the Kynges high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe / and ſo put to death / woo ſhall come to tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe accuſers / yf they repent not by tymes. And yf D.

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:9769:5"/>Now (indifferent reader) to the intent that thou mayeſt the more clearly / diſcerne light fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> darkneſſe / and knowe gods true worde from falſe docrine / I ſhall (whan I haue ſayde ſomwhat to Standiſh preface) rehearce vnto the.
