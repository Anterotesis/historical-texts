            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>REFLECTIONS
ON THE
LATE EXAMINATION
OF THE
<hi>Oxford Decree.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>A <hi>Modeſt examination of the</hi> Oxford <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree;</hi>
So the Dean begins his Book: But
the whole Book, and almoſt every page
in it, is a very plain and effectual confutation of
the Title; in which you will find as little mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
in this cenſure of the <hi>Decree,</hi> as there is
ſoundneſs and truth in the propoſitions which are
condemned by it. The former is juſt as <hi>decent</hi>
as the latter are <hi>Orthodox,</hi> and they may each of
them be thus called by the ſame figure, which is
commonly known by the name of <hi>Antiphraſis;</hi>
as ſome ſay <hi>Parcae</hi> are ſo called <hi>à non parcendo.</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:65402:4"/>
But the Dean is to be excuſed, if any excuſe may
be framed from long uſe and cuſtome, which have
rendred ſuch a way of contradicting himſelf ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual,
and that habit is turned almoſt into a
ſecond nature.</p>
            <p>I ſhall readily therefore acknowledge, (and let
him take what advantage he pleaſes of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion)
that there is as great an harmony between
this Title and the Book, as there is between the
ſeveral parts of this, and and ſome others of his
late diſcourſes. Upon which account I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
bin induced to think, that a man could not
reaſonably deſire to encounter a fairer Antagoniſt
than the Dean, who will ſave his Adverſary the
pains and trouble of confuting him; he will do
it ſo often and ſo effectually himſelf.</p>
            <p>It hath long ſince bin made an obſervation,
that when men have once caſt away the Faith,
they at the ſame time make ſhipwrack of a ſound
and diſcerning judgment; being oftentimes, as a
juſt puniſhment of their pride and vanity, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
up <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to a mind which cannot
rightly judge of, and diſtinguiſh the natures of
things. One would almoſt be temted to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
that ſome ſuch thing hath overtaken this
Dean, who as he doth not make a right difference,
in ſome points of great importance, between
<hi>truth and falſhood:</hi> ſo in theſe papers he ſeems to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65402:4"/>
have loſt all diſtinction between <hi>reaſon and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtry;
between arrogance and Modeſty.</hi> For
if this be a modeſt vindication of his Opinions,
then we have loſt the true ſignification of words.</p>
            <p>But perhaps he will come off, and relieve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
as he doth upon ſome other occaſions, by his
<hi>meaning.</hi> It is true indeed, if you will judge of
things by the letter and words of his book, he
hath treated the Governors of the Univerſity
with great inſolence and contempt: but yet ſtill
he <hi>meant</hi> nothing but fairneſs and reſpect to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them; and therefore in ſpight of what can
be ſaid to the contrary, his diſcourſe ſhall ſtill be
called a <hi>Modeſt examination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am loath to part with this word, becauſe if I
do, I muſt bid a final adieu to it, and never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
to find any thing again like it, at leaſt in this
book. If any man therefore who at preſent hath
a good opinion of this Dean's modeſty, hath a
mind likewiſe to continue in it, then I muſt tell
him, if he meets with this <hi>examination,</hi> he muſt
be content to read but a few pages; nay that is too
much; <hi>Titulo debet, aut ſi placet, Titulis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentus
eſſe.</hi> He muſt be ſatisfied to read only the
Title of the book, or at moſt the Titles of the
Author; which are enough in all reaſon. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
before this trifling paper, he hath prefixt ſo
many of them, as if he had a mind to oppreſs thoſe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65402:5"/>
by his <hi>puiſſance,</hi> whom he deſpaired to ſubdue by
his <hi>reaſons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true indeed, they are all of them (not
now to enquire into his merits) ſuch as he hath
reaſon to be proud of: But however it will not
become him to ſwell and look too big: for I muſt
tell him, tho theſe Titles, may give him a place
above ſome of the Heads of Houſes; yet neither
will they, nor twice as many more put together,
render him equal to all, or the major part of them
when met together. He cannot be offended then
if I put him in mind of the <hi>frog in the Fable:</hi> he
knows the ſtory, it will become him to make
the application; or if he will not, ſome body elſe
would do well to whiſper him in the ear, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe
him, <hi>ne te infles, ne intumeſcas,</hi> Decane, <hi>non
ſi te ruperis par eris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now from the Preface, I proceed to
the Book. But before I come to conſider his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination
of the Decree, there are certain paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
and expreſſions, here and there diſperſed in
theſe papers, which muſt not ſlightly and diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectfully
be paſſed over, but call for our notice
and obſervation.</p>
            <p>And the firſt thing I am to take notice of is, the
manner how he treats the <hi>Oxford Decree,</hi> and
the perſons who made and publiſhed it. The
<hi>Decree</hi> he ſtyles <hi>raſh and injudicious,</hi> the <hi>raſh
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65402:5"/>
and hasty judgment of ſome Heads, p.</hi> 10. which
Heads he all a long by way of contempt calls
<hi>theſe Heads, Decreeing, Hereſy-making Heads, p.</hi>
46. who in their determinations, have not only
oppoſed the <hi>common faith of Christians,</hi> but acted
likewiſe in oppoſition to the <hi>common ſenſe of
mankind.</hi> Of them he farther ſaith, that they
talk of the <hi>Fathers and Councils,</hi> but are whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ignorant of thoſe matters, of which they have
no knowledge, except it be by <hi>inſpiration or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſy.</hi>
And in ſhort, this ignorance and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
hath betrayed them into a belief,
and declaration of what is at the ſame time both
<hi>Hereſy and nonſenſe;</hi> and for which, not only
all learned men, but even the moſt <hi>illiterate
plowmen,</hi> whom he makes competent judges of
theſe matters, will <hi>condemn them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall conſider firſt what he ſaith of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeing
Heads,</hi> and then of the <hi>Decree</hi> its ſelf.
Now as to what concerns the Heads of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſity,
I believe there is no indifferent ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-by,
that is, no man who is not perfectly of
this Dean's <hi>complexion and interest,</hi> but will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
that he hath treated them in a very
rude, and unbecoming manner. He ought to
have conſidered who were preſent at this meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and to have made ſome diſtinction at leaſt.
Among them he ought in the firſt place to have
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65402:6"/>
thought upon the <hi>Vicechancellor,</hi> who preſided
in this meeting, and not over-haſtily to have paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
his Cenſure, without a <hi>ſalva reverentia,</hi> a
preface of reſpect, which is due to his place and
Character. For he ſhould be put in mind of,
what now perhaps by reaſon of his long abſence
from the Univerſity he may have almoſt forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
that the <hi>Vicechancellor</hi> of this, as alſo of our
Siſter Univerſity, upon the account of the
greatneſs of his Truſt, and the condition and
quality of the perſons under his Government,
hath bin always thought to deſerve a place, and
hath accordingly bin ranked, with the chiefeſt
Magiſtrates, and Officers of Corporations in the
Kingdom. Upon which account he hath bin
wont to be treated with Honor and reſpect by all
perſons of good manners, and civil behaviour.</p>
            <p>Beſides <hi>him,</hi> among the perſons who compoſed
that meeting, (as his friends who gave him an
account of what paſſed there, might, and I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
did inform him) there were two more,
one whereof upon the account of his noble birth,
and the other of his Character and Station in the
Church, deſerved to have bin diſtinguiſhed.
But he without any reſtriction or qualification,
jumbles and ſhakes all theſe Heads together, and
repreſents them to the World, as a Company of
<hi>indiſcreet, ignorant, raſh men.</hi> Some of the <hi>wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65402:6"/>
Heads</hi> indeed he ſaith <hi>were abſent;</hi> by which
he would have it believed, that thoſe who were
preſent were a Company of <hi>illiterate and injudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
blockheads.</hi> And ſo infallibly they muſt be,
if in the affairs of religion, and the judgment and
doctrines of the Ancient Church, they underſtand
nothing but by <hi>propheſy or inſpiration,</hi> as he
ſaith, p. 31. that is, nothing at all. Neither can
he relieve himſelf, by ſuggeſting as if ſome <hi>who
were preſent diſsented.</hi> For his friends might
have informed him, that after ſome previous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
as uſually happens at ſuch meetings;
when the <hi>Cenſure and Decree</hi> was ſetled and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
upon, there was not one perſon who open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his mouth, or ſaid one word in oppoſition to
it, either as to matter or form. So that all who
were preſent are equally involved in thoſe decent
epithets before mentioned.</p>
            <p>From the <hi>Decreeing Heads</hi> let us paſs to the
<hi>Decree</hi> it ſelf; this is ſtyled <hi>the raſh and hasty
judgment of ſome of the Heads of Colleges and
Halls;</hi> and immediately afterwards, he ſets him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to ſhew the <hi>raſhneſs and injudiciouſneſs</hi> of
this Decree, <hi>p.</hi> 11. Sure our Author when he made
this reflexion had his own writings before him,
in which there are ſo many marks of haſt and
precipitation. But let us conſider theſe epithets
apart. Firſt he ſays it was a <hi>haſty judgment;</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:65402:7"/>
but that is more than he knows; and if it were
as haſty as he imagines, yet I muſt tell him, that
is no diſparagement to it in this caſe. For there
are ſome things ſo groſsly and palpably falſe and
abſurd, that their falſhood and abſurdity appear
at firſt view, and therefore require no long time,
or previous deliberation to detect them, and when
they are ſo detected, I hope it is no Argument of
raſhneſs to condemn them. And ſuch were the
propoſitions cenſured in the Decree, which are
directly repugnant to the common faith, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſally
received doctrines of all ſound Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians;
tending plainly to overthrow the <hi>Unity
of the Godhead,</hi> which is the firſt and Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
principle of all Religion, whether natural
or revealed.</p>
            <p>But if theſe propoſitions were not ſo groſsly and
palpably abſurd, yet the condemnation of them
could not be accounted <hi>injudicious;</hi> becauſe the
Heads, who were concerned in that Cenſure, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
followed and were governed by the <hi>judgment</hi>
and determinations of Fathers and Councils. To
make this more plain. Suppoſe any one now ſhould
aſſert, that there are <hi>two perſons,</hi> or but <hi>one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
in Chriſt, and thereby revive the Hereſy of
<hi>Neſtorius,</hi> or <hi>Eutyches;</hi> would it require any
long time and previous conſultations to Cenſure
thoſe poſitions? or could ſuch a Cenſure ſo paſſed
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65402:7"/>
be accuſed of raſhneſs? I ſay no, becauſe we have
the example and Authority of two <hi>General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,</hi>
to juſtify ſuch a Condemnation, which cannot
be impeached of imprudence, without reflecting
upon the wiſdom and integrity, not only of the
Fathers who compoſed thoſe auguſt Aſſemblies,
but likewiſe of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> which hath
confirmed their ſentence, by rejecting thoſe er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
which they Condemned. He on the other
hand, is juſtly to be accounted raſh and arrogant
who preſumes to oppoſe his own ſingle opinion,
to the judgment and determinations of Fathers
and Councils; and upon that account endeavors
<hi>fixa refigere,</hi> to ſhake and unſetle thoſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
and thoſe words in which they have bin
conveyed down to us, and which are now univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally
eſtabliſhed in the Chriſtian Church.</p>
            <p>In ſhort therefore, to cenſure any poſitions
which have already bin condemned by any <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Councils,</hi> doth not require any ſlow or
tedious conſultations; it is ſufficient to declare
them impious and ſcandalous, becauſe they have
bin ſo adjudged formerly, by aſſemblies compoſed
of perſons who have bin celebrated for their wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and learning, and renowned for their ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in the faith and their zeal for it.</p>
            <p>And ſo it was in the caſe before us. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
cenſured by the Decree, were ſuch as
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65402:8"/>
had formerly bin condemned by the famous <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of Nice,</hi> whoſe <hi>Determinations</hi> have bin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
with reſpect and reverence by all good
Chriſtians, and make up at this day part of the
eſtabliſhed Doctrine of all the Churches in the
Chriſtian World: who, amidſt that variety of
judgments and opinions in other matters, are
at perfect agreement among themſelves in this,
that the Father and Son are <hi>Conſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,</hi>
or of one and the ſame Subſtance, to which
aſſertions the propoſitions condemned, are plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and diametrically oppoſite; it being abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
impoſſible that two or three individual
Subſtances, ſhould be one and the ſame Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing which ought not to be paſſed
over without obſervation, is that undecent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection,
which in more places than one of this
examination, he paſſes upon <hi>zeal.</hi> One would
think, he accounteth it unlawful and unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable
in the affairs of Religion; or elſe ſure
he would never brand any man with the name of
<hi>Zealot,</hi> as if it were a mark of infamy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach.
He ought therefore to be told, that
there never was a juſt ſenſe, and a firm belief of
Religion found in any perſon, where it was not
likewiſe accompanyed with <hi>a zeal &amp; concern</hi> for
it; which for that reaſon was never condemed by
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65402:8"/>
any wiſe or honeſt man. Neither indeed can it
be cenſured, without a bold and dangerous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
upon our bleſſed Savior himſelf; and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with him, upon thoſe wiſe and good men
who in all ages of the world, as occaſion hath
ſerved, have ſhewen a <hi>zeal</hi> for the Glory of God,
and a juſt concern for the preſervation, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of the true Religion.</p>
            <p>It is true indeed it may be, as oftentimes it hath
bin, joined with ignorance, or exceſs; in which
caſes it hath bin found to be ſo far from being ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
to the intereſt of truth, that it hath ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
bin the occaſion of a great deal of miſchief in
the world. But on the other hand, to diſparage
and expoſe it without any juſt reſtriction and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation,
is to introduce a <hi>coldneſs and indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>
among men in the great affairs of Religion,
which in time may end in the ruin and extincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it.</p>
            <p>Perhaps it will be ſaid, that he doth not deſign
to condemn <hi>zeal</hi> abſolutely and for it ſelf, but as
it is to be found in conjunction with ſome other
ill qualifications, which are apt to corrupt and
ſpoil it: the beſt things being liable to abuſe, and
when they are ſo abuſed, they often prove very
hurtful and miſchievous. I find it therefore joined
with two other qualities, for the ſake of which
poſſily, he may ſpeak diſreſpectfully of it. The firſt
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65402:9"/>
whereof is <hi>Warmth,</hi> p. 2. where he repreſents a
certain member of the Univerſity under the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of <hi>a warm Zealot;</hi> which to be ſure he
did not deſign to be a commendation, but rather
a Title of contempt and diſgrace. The other
is <hi>Orthodoxie</hi> or ſoundneſs in the faith, p. 24.
where in the ſame ſlight and contemptuous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
he ſtyles ſome perſons, <hi>our modern Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox
Zealots;</hi> to which he joyns an other orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Epithete <hi>of Hereſy makers.</hi> It may not
poſſibly then be <hi>bare naked Zeal,</hi> but zeal thus
<hi>qualified,</hi> which he thinks fit to condemn.</p>
            <p>As to the firſt Epithete of <hi>Warm;</hi> if zeal found
in conjunction with <hi>Warmth,</hi> be blame-worthy,
than I would fain know of him where he can di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
us to find out any kind of zeal, which will not
come under the ſame condemnation. In all his
great reading did he ever meet with any Author
who furniſhed him with the notion of a <hi>cold
zeal;</hi> or in this caſe did he ever meet with any
medium between hot and cold, i. e. <hi>a luke-warm
zeal.</hi> Doth this great critick in languages know
whence this word is derived?</p>
            <p>Perhaps he will ſay, that it was not the bare
<hi>Warmth,</hi> but the <hi>Exceſs</hi> of it, which he diſliked
in this <hi>Zealot.</hi> But I do not hear that he did
promote any petition, or uſe any endeavors that
the Sermon ſhould be <hi>burned,</hi> but that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65402:9"/>
delivered in it which gave great occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of offence, ſhould be <hi>condemned.</hi> However
let the warmth of this <hi>zealot</hi> be what it will,
the reflexion made upon it by this examiner can
never be excuſed in him, who in many of his
writings diſcovers ſuch an <hi>intemperate heat,</hi> as
hath bin diſapproved by his friends as well as
enemies. Nay there is one peculiar circumſtance
of his <hi>warmth,</hi> for which I think no tolerable
excuſe can poſſibly be made by any perſon, tho
never ſo much byaſſed in his favor; and that is,
the <hi>fervor</hi> which he hath diſcovered on both ſides
of the queſtion; having diſcourſed <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi>
and with <hi>equal violence</hi> appeared in defence of
quite contrary opinions.</p>
            <p>It is true indeed, it is no diſparagement to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
man to alter his opinion; provided that that
change be attended with modeſty, and ſupported
by reaſon. But whoever ſhall maintain both parts
of a contradiction, and then with equal fury
ſhall think to bear down all oppoſition; it is plain
ſuch an one can have no ſincere concern for truth,
but only for his own opinion, and thereby
gives too great occaſion, to call in queſtion ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his <hi>judgment, or ſincerity,</hi> which are hereby
brought under a juſt ſuſpicion.</p>
            <p>But <hi>2dly,</hi> Suppoſing that a <hi>warm zeal</hi> may be
excuſed, yet I find a zeal for <hi>the Faith</hi> is not like
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65402:10"/>
to meet with the ſame fair quarter; for an <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox
Zealot,</hi> is a pernicious creature, and never
to be endured; who will be ſure either to find
or make Hereſies; and thereby diſturb the qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
and peace of the world. But where, I beſeech
you, can a man employ his zeal more commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dably,
than in the defence and maintenance of
the truth; eſpecially when it is of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance?
As it certainly muſt be, when the oppoſite
error is ſuch, as plainly overturns the foundations
of our Religion; and this is plainly the caſe before
us. But it ſeems, a zeal for errors, for falſe and
impious opinions may be warranted, tho attended
with all the warmth, nay with all the rudeneſs
and ſcurrility imaginable; but we muſt not lift
up a finger to ſupport the faith, nor open our
mouths in defence of it, but preſently they muſt
be ſtopped again, with ſuch dirty &amp; foul language
as this examiner thinks fit to fling in our faces.
This is not juſt and equal dealing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly,</hi> The next thing that calls for our obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
is, that ſtrange vein of pride and haughty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
which runs through this paper. To give an
account of all particulars of this nature, would
be in a manner to tranſcribe his book, which
ought not to be honoured with too many Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
I ſhall therefore confine my ſelf to two
particulars, in which a vanity and arrogance
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65402:10"/>
which are inſupportable are too plainly diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, the charge of <hi>Hereſy,</hi> which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
in every page, he lays at the doors of all
them who differ from him in his notion of three
<hi>distinct minds and ſubſtances</hi> in the bleſſed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
the denyal of which he over and over calls
<hi>Sabellianiſm,</hi> and in the concluſion of theſe papers,
he dubbs with the honourable titles <hi>of Hereſy and
nonſenſe.</hi> But I would fain know how this
Dean comes to be thus inveſted with this large
Authority and prerogative of <hi>adjudging and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
Hereſy,</hi> which he ſaith, and ſaith right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>ought not to be entrusted with any ſingle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
nor any body of men leſs than a National
Synod.</hi> I do not know that he is his Majeſtie's
High Commiſſioner for Eccleſiaſtical affairs.</p>
            <p>Perhaps it will be ſaid, that he did this by way
of retaliation: the <hi>Heads of Houſes</hi> declared his
notion of <hi>three minds and ſubstances</hi> to be Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal;
and he adjudges their opinion of <hi>three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
and one ſubstance</hi> to be ſo too. Here he
doth but recriminate, and therefore is on the
ſame level with theſe <hi>Decreeing Hereſy-making
Heads.</hi> If this be a fault, it is a fault on both
ſides, and they are alike equally criminal.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, <hi>1ſt,</hi> That the <hi>Heads of
Houſes</hi> by the judgment and declaration which
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65402:11"/>
they made, were very far from deſigning to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
to themſelves an illegal and extravagant
power of adjudging or declaring any matter or
cauſe to be Hereſy, which was not, as they
thought, adjudged and declared to be ſo before
by a competent Authority, and allowed for ſuch
by the Laws of this Land. The Doctrine of <hi>one
ſubstance</hi> was Decreed in the <hi>Council of Nice,</hi>
confirmed afterwards by all the other <hi>General
Councils;</hi> to which the contrary opinion of <hi>three
ſubstances,</hi> as was ſaid before, is diametrically op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite;
and therefore by the whole Church hath
bin in former ages accounted and adjudged <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the other hand, the examiner declares the
belief of <hi>one ſubstance</hi> in the Trinity to be He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy,
not only which had never bin declared ſo
before by any <hi>Council</hi> either <hi>general or particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar:</hi>
but quite contrary to the plain meaning of
the <hi>Canonical Scriptures,</hi> to the expreſs deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
of <hi>General Councils,</hi> to the eſtabliſhed
Faith and Doctrine of the <hi>Catholick Church;</hi> to
all which, he hath with unparallel'd pride and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumtion
bid defyance, and thereby brings him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
within the compaſs and condemnation of the
Law.</p>
            <p>But <hi>2dly,</hi> The judgment and declaration of the
<hi>Heads of Houſes,</hi> was made with a particular
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65402:11"/>
regard to the Members of their own Body, over
whom they are entruſted with a juſt and legal
Authority. They have reaſon to look upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to be under a ſtrict and ſacred obligation,
to prevent as far as in them lies, the growth of
any pernicious Doctrines in Religion. Some
ſuch had bin preached among them, which they
had reaſon to fear, might in time gain ground,
if not timely obviated. To prevent therefore
the infection and growth of ſuch <hi>falſe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
opinions,</hi> they thought fit to publiſh their
Decree, which, as I ſaid before, had a particular
regard to thoſe perſons who were committed to
their care, <hi>eorum fidei &amp; curae commiſſis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this Dean like an <hi>Univerſal Paſtor and
Biſhop,</hi> ſets himſelf as it were in <hi>Cathedra,</hi> and
from thence he dictates to the <hi>whole Church.</hi>
He lifts up his voice, as if he would ſay, <hi>audiat
orbis Chriſtianus,</hi> I do declare, and let all perſons
take notice of it at their peril, that the Doctrine
of three Perſons, and one God, or <hi>one Substance</hi>
in the God-head (which is all one, as ſhall be
ſhewn by and by) is <hi>Sabellianiſm,</hi> is <hi>Hereſy
and nonſence.</hi> Would not this Dean, think you,
have done well to have adviſed with ſome men
of skill and learning, how far the reputation of
his <hi>wiſdom and modeſty,</hi> (not now to mention
the <hi>Integrity of his Faith,</hi> which thereby may
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65402:12"/>
be juſtly called in queſtion,) might be affected
by ſuch a bold and preſumtuous declaration?</p>
            <p>The next inſtance of his great modeſty may
be found in the <hi>11th</hi> and <hi>12th</hi> pages of this exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
where he makes an Apology for the
uſe of <hi>new forms of words, unuſual, unſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
forms of ſpeech, in order to explain and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
as he calls it the Catholick Faith:</hi> ſeveral
of which, as it is very well known, this exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
had invented and made uſe of to this purpoſe,
in his vindication of the bleſſed Trinity, and for
which he was juſtly called to an account by the
learned <hi>Animadverter.</hi> Now among other things,
which he offers in vindication of this bold and
dangerous practice, p. 12. he tells us, <hi>That the
Church tho it never had authority to make a
new Faith, yet it always had, and always will
have authority to declare and explain the true
Catholick Faith, in ſuch words as are most aptly
expreſſive of it, and neceſsary to countermine
the Arts and Evaſions of Hereticks.</hi> And this
he ſaith <hi>will justify the uſe of ſuch expreſſions as
theſe,</hi> Three diſtinct infinite Minds, and Spirits,
or three ſubſtances, <hi>how novel ſoever they may
be thought.</hi> To this ſuggeſtion of his I have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
things to Anſwer. Firſt he ſaith the <hi>Church</hi>
hath Authority to uſe new, and unuſual forms of
words in Articles of Faith. But I am apt to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65402:12"/>
think ſhe would be very unwilling to exerciſe
her power, and would never do it, except when
preſſed with a great and an unavoidable neceſſity.
We have reaſon to think it would be one of her
laſt remedies, when all other methods of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
the faith had proved ineffectual.</p>
            <p>It is true indeed, in the Ancient Church, the
meaning of certain words which ſometime were
of doubtful and ambiguous ſignification, were
afterwards ſettled and determined, ſuch as was
<hi>ſubstantia, perſona,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. And ſome new
unſcriptural words, ſuch as the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, were made
choice of by the Fathers, and put into their
Creeds, in order to detect the hypocriſy and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy
of the <hi>Arians.</hi> But this was not done till
after many diſputations, and great deliberation:
and afterwards they thought themſelves obliged
to declare the neceſſity they were under, of
ſettling the ſenſe of one word upon this important
ſubject, which was not a new word neither, but
ſuch as had bin formerly uſed; before they would
impoſe it on the Church. So weighty a thing
was the faith and peace of the Church, in the
opinion of thoſe great men in thoſe days.</p>
            <p>But tho they introduced ſome new words, and
ſettled the ſignification of others, they never did
attempt to alter, and lay aſide the uſe of any
which had formerly bin of general uſage, and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65402:13"/>
univerſally received among Chriſtians, in order
to introduce new ones in the room of them. On
the other hand the Church hath condemned all
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, all new invented terms; and hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
the introducing any ſuch, under the pain of
<hi>deprivation or Anathematization.</hi> And for this
Decree of the <hi>6th General Council,</hi> the third
of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> the Church in ſucceeding ages
hath preſerved ſo great a veneration, that none,
either <hi>Greek or Latin, Roman or Reformed,</hi>
have ever ſince complained of the hardſhip of
that Synodical ſentence, or have endeavored to
reverſe it. But on the other hand, they have
declared a high diſpleaſure againſt all ſuch who
have at any time attempted any ſuch innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
As is evident from the fate that attended
<hi>Abbot Joachim,</hi> and <hi>Valentinus Gentilis,</hi> the one
in his book, the other in his perſon.</p>
            <p>All this the <hi>Dean</hi> had formerly bin put in
mind of by the learned <hi>Animadverter;</hi> and
yet notwithſtanding this monition, he ſtill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
in that preſumtuous humor, of uſing and
defending theſe <hi>new, unuſual, inconvenient</hi> forms
of ſpeech; and which he himſelf allows may be
liable to an <hi>Heretical meaning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>2dly,</hi> Let it be granted, that the <hi>Church</hi>
may alter old phraſes; but hath ſhe actually
made uſe of that her Authority in the caſe before
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:65402:13"/>
us? Hath ſhe publiſhed any declaration, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
ſhe hath diſcovered her pleaſure in this affair,
viz. that the old words, ſuch as thoſe of <hi>perſons,
Hypostaſis, ſubſistence,</hi> ſhould be laid aſide to
make room for <hi>ſelf-conſciouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>mutual
conſciouſneſs?</hi> Or that <hi>one nature, one eſſence,
one ſubstance,</hi> muſt be diſcarded, and in their
place, the phraſes of <hi>three distinct minds, ſpirits,
and ſubstances</hi> ſhould be introduced. That
maxime in Law, is true here in Divinity; <hi>eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem
modo res ſolvitur quo ligatur.</hi> The <hi>Church</hi>
hath tyed us to the uſe of theſe words, I pray
who hath ſet us at liberty? why he ſaith, or at
leaſt intimates, that the <hi>Church</hi> hath. But what
Church I beſeech you? why none that I know
of, except it be that which is included, and
which he carries about with him in his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
How comes he to be ſtyled the Church?
That you muſt know is by a Synecdoche, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the <hi>Dean of a Church</hi> may be called the
<hi>Church</hi> it ſelf. Tho others may account it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a <hi>Catachreſis,</hi> or <hi>vocis abuſio;</hi> when a word
is abuſed, being transferred from a proper to a
very improper and abſurd ſignification.</p>
            <p>But ſure the <hi>Dean</hi> cannot ſo far forget him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
as to arrogate to himſelf the name of the
Church. He doth not that I know of indeed aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
the <hi>name,</hi> but he plainly doth the <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:65402:14"/>
of the Church. And under her name and
power he ſhelters himſelf. For as was ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
p. 16. he juſtifies his own innovations, by
ſaying <hi>that the Church always had, and always
will have Authority to uſe ſuch words as ſhe
thinks moſt expreſſive of the faith.</hi> How can
this Apology vindicate him, except either he be
the Church, or at leaſt be commiſſioned by her,
and inveſted with her Authority?</p>
            <p>I preſume he will not pretend to be <hi>formally</hi>
the Church either <hi>Oecumenical or National.</hi> He
muſt therefore only be ſo, either <hi>virtually,</hi> or by
way of <hi>repreſentation.</hi> And ſure ſome ſuch
thing he fancies of himſelf, viz. that the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Faith,</hi> or at leaſt the <hi>words</hi> wherein it is
to be expreſſed, are committed to his care, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are to be diſpoſed of at his pleaſure. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
ſure he would never talk as he doth in this
book. For inſtance, p. 16. He hath theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
words. <hi>Now ſince Perſon is the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
word, which long Eccleſiaſtical uſe hath
rendered familiar, I ſhould by no means allow
of any other word in this mystery, could we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Catholick Faith, together with the word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What muſt words be uſed, or laid aſide at
his diſcretion? He acknowledges the word to be
Eccleſiaſtical: the Church hath made it her own;
ſhe hath adopted it into her Creeds, and confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:65402:14"/>
of her Faith: by long uſe it is now ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
familiar, and is become the common Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of all Chriſtians. What Authority I pray
hath he to order the laying of it aſide? <hi>I ſhould
by no means allow, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is fit he ſhould be told upon this occaſion,
that this word was anciently uſed without his
leave, and will ſtill continue to be ſo without
his allowance. For neither the faith nor lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of the Church have any ſuch dependance
upon him, as that they muſt ſtand or fall at his
pleaſure.</p>
            <p>But laſtly, whatever Authority the Church
may have to alter the <hi>uſual and received forms
of ſpeech,</hi> yet to be ſure ſhe would never exerciſe
it, except forced, as was intimated before, by
ſome very great, and ſome very apparent reaſon.
To this he anſwers <hi>that there is as great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and neceſſity for ſuch an alteration of words
now, as ever there was in any age of the Church,</hi>
p. 12. And the reaſon that he aſſigns is this, <hi>viz.</hi>
That we are <hi>in great danger of loſing the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Faith, by the revival of the Hereſy of
Sabellius,</hi> p. 16. which walks publickly abroad,
tho under the diſguiſe of a new name. And if
we believe him it is <hi>one of thoſe doctrines too pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
received in the Church of England, which
are not the true doctrines of our Church,</hi> p. 44.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:65402:15"/>
Now this, I cannot but ſay, is not only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
falſe, but likewiſe a very ſcandalous ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion.
Becauſe it muſt not only affect our own
times and Nation; but likewiſe bring all other
Churches <hi>Ancient and Modern, Eaſtern and
Weſtern, Roman and Reformed</hi> under the ſame
ſuſpicion. For all theſe are at perfect agreement
both in the belief of the Doctrine of the Trinity,
and in the manner of expreſſing their Faith;
which is by the profeſſion of <hi>three perſons,</hi> and
<hi>one nature or ſubstance.</hi> So that if by retaining
the old words there is danger of loſing the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Faith,</hi> it muſt be loſt out of the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church:</hi> and this revolt to <hi>Sabellianiſm,</hi>
muſt be both the moſt laſting, and the moſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<hi>Apostaſy,</hi> that ever was foretold, or feared
ſhould happen to the Chriſtian Church.</p>
            <p>But as to what may concern this Church, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
if all wiſe and good men in it, have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to fear any danger, 'tis from another quarter;
I mean from the revival of the <hi>Hereſies</hi> of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,
Pelagius,</hi> and <hi>Socinus,</hi> which ſome evil men
with great induſtry, and with no ſmall art, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor
to propagate among us.</p>
            <p>But <hi>2dly,</hi> Tho the charge of <hi>Sabellianiſm</hi> be
a very great and heavy one, yet we ought not
to look upon it to be ſuch a bug-bear, as thereby
to be affrighted out of our Religion. We may
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:65402:15"/>
comfort our ſelves with this, that this imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is no other, nor better, than what hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
bin made by <hi>Hereticks</hi> againſt the <hi>Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox.</hi>
For the <hi>Arian</hi>
               <note n="1" place="bottom">Orthodoxi univerſo orbi Chriſtiano teſtatum faciunt, ſe Patrem, Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium, &amp; S iritum Sanctum in unum individuum conflare, ita ut pater non ſit alius revera quam filius; nec filius alius quam pater; ſed ejuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem ſubſtantiae uterque, idque hoc ipſum eſt quod Haereſis Sabelliana. <hi>Arian. apud Zanch.</hi>

               <hi>Valentinus
Gentilis</hi> in order to eſtabliſh his Doctrine of <hi>three

againſt the <hi>Catholick Faith,</hi> with relation
to the error of <hi>Sabellius. Cantilenam Sabellii no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis
obgannit,</hi> ſaith <hi>Aretius</hi> of <hi>Gentilis; &amp; eandem
nobis cantilenam occinit Decanus,</hi> may we ſay.</p>
            <p>But as they who believe three perſons and but
one nature or ſubſtance, are as far from being
<hi>Sabellians,</hi> as any the greateſt <hi>Tritheiſt;</hi> ſo they
no doubt will be as ready to oppoſe the attempts
of ſuch, who at any time hereafter may endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor
to revive the Hereſy of <hi>Sabellius.</hi> But in
order to combate that Hereſy, they will not
think themſelves obliged to uſe any other wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65402:16"/>
than thoſe with which in former times it
hath bin ſo ſuccesfully vanquiſhed. The faith hath
bin tranſmitted down to us for theſe thirteen cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies,
in that <hi>form of ſound words,</hi> viz. <hi>Three
Perſons and one nature,</hi> and hath conquered all
oppoſition made againſt it; and in all times ſince,
they who have refuſed the <hi>Language</hi> of the
Church, have bin juſtly ſuſpected to be no true
friends to the <hi>faith of it;</hi> which now by long
uſe, and the preſcription of ſo many ages, have
contracted ſuch a friendſhip, that they are like
to live or die together.</p>
            <p>And therefore we find none, as I now inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated,
who in any times heretofore, either quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled
with, or rejected the words eſtabliſhed in
the Church, but either open <hi>Hereticks,</hi> or ſuch
who were juſtly ſuſpected to favor their errors.
Thus of old, the <hi>Arians</hi> and <hi>Semi-Arians</hi> were
diſpleaſed with the words, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
becauſe theſe<note n="1" place="bottom">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

to many forſooth; and were ſuch as rather per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed
than explained this Doctrine, being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the reach of mens underſtanding and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions.
So the <hi>Poliſh</hi> and <hi>Tranſylvanian U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitarians</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:65402:16"/>
in their times made the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints.
That the Church by uſing thoſe words,
<hi>homoouſion, Perſon, Eſsence, Unity, Trinity,</hi> had
perfectly confounded all right notions of God,
and in a manner overturned the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
<hi>Valentinus Gentilis</hi> echoed back the ſame
calumnies, from <hi>Bern</hi> and <hi>Geneva,</hi> and called
the former words <hi>monstroſae &amp; profanae voces,
quibus omnia divina mysteria pervertuntur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to bring up the rear, we find the Dean
in his vindication, declaring his diſpleaſure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them in the like expreſſions, p. 138.
where he tells us, that that which hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
this myſtery, hath bin the vain endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor
of reducing it to terms of art, ſuch as <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
Eſſence, Subſtance, Existence, Hypoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,
Perſon</hi> and the like. I am ſorry to find
him in ſuch ill company. Tho I charitably hope
he is not engaged in the ſame evil deſigns with
them. However it will become all men of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and integrity, to avoid giving any the leaſt
countenance to ſuch tho but ſuſpicious practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
which we have reaſon to think, were firſt
ſet on foot on purpoſe to undermine our holy
Faith and Religion.</p>
            <p>There is one thing more to be obſerved, before
I come to conſider the propoſitions, which I had
almoſt forgotten; but it muſt not by any means
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:65402:17"/>
be omitted, and that is, his very curious and cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
remark upon the Latin Decree, p. 5. where
he tells us that <hi>he who drew it up need not brag
much of his skill in Latin, having tranſgreſſed
the plain rules of Grammar, in uſing</hi> EORUM
FIDEI ET CURAE <hi>for</hi> SUAE FIDEI ET CU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RAE.
And for this, that you may not rely on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
on his word and ſingle judgment, he vouches
the Authority of ſome Criticks, <hi>ſome Criticks
ſay,</hi> &amp;c. Who thoſe Criticks are we are not able
to divine: perhaps they may be found in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of thoſe <hi>wiſe and Learned men whom he
mentions in the 6th page, and of whom he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes
to procure a meeting any day in the
year, to cenſure the Oxford Decree.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But whoſoever thoſe Criticks were, I am ſure
neither He nor They have any great reaſon to
boaſt of their skill in <hi>Criticiſm.</hi> For I would
fain know what thoſe Rules of Grammer are
which he ſaith are tranſgreſſed, by uſing <hi>eorum</hi>
for <hi>ſuae fidei.</hi> Some waggs ſure pretending to
be Criticks impoſed on him. I will endeavor to
ſet him right. And therefore for his better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
I would direct him to the Oxford
Grammar, and to the obſervations which are
there made, p. 232. upon the pronouns <hi>ſui</hi> and
<hi>ſuus,</hi> which are called <hi>Reciproca, quia reflectun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur
ad id quod praeceſſit in eadem oratione.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:65402:17"/>
But perhaps he may think that book beneath
his peruſal; he may therefore, if he pleaſes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
<hi>Gerhard Voſſius,</hi> in his book <hi>de Sermonis
conſtructione,</hi> where in the <hi>56th</hi> chap. he will
find three Canons or Rules laid down <hi>de Reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procis;</hi>
the laſt of which, being to our preſent
purpoſe, is this: <hi>Si ob neglectum reciproci nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la
oriatur ambiguitas, potest aliquando reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proci
loco aliud relativum poni.</hi> This is the
Rule, and there he may likewiſe find ſeveral
examples among the moſt approved Authors.
Cic. Philipp. 2. <hi>Omnes boniquantum</hi> in ipſis
fuit, <hi>Caeſarem occiderunt.</hi> Idem 3. de Off. <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuga
Fabritio pollicitus est, ſi praemium</hi> ei <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſuiſſet,

erunt in</hi> ipſius <hi>potestate.</hi> Quinctil. Declam. 3.
<hi>neque ignoravit, quae</hi> eum <hi>manerent pericu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la.</hi>
More inſtances he may there find to this
purpoſe, out of <hi>Curtius, Pliny, &amp;c.</hi> Now the
Dean I hope will not be ſo hardy, as to ſay,
that <hi>Tully,</hi> and <hi>Pliny,</hi> and <hi>Quinctilian</hi> were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the rules, nay the plain rules of Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar.
The Dean I verily believe, knew nothing
of this matter. He hath no better way then
that I can think of to come off, but to tell the
world that ſome perſons under the diſguiſe of
Criticks impoſed upon him; the confeſſion of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65402:18"/>
his ignorance being in this caſe his beſt excuſe,
tho at beſt it is but a very ſorry one.</p>
            <p>Having thus finiſhed theſe previous remarks,
I come now to conſider more particularly the
<hi>Propoſitions</hi> which occaſioned the <hi>Oxford De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,</hi>
and which were condemned by it. The
<hi>Propoſitions</hi> are theſe: <hi>There are three infinite
diſtinct minds and ſubſtances in the Trinity.</hi>
Item, <hi>that the three perſons in the Trinity, are
three infinite diſtinct minds or ſpirits, and three
individual Subſtances.</hi> Theſe are adjudged and
declared to be <hi>Falſe, Impious, &amp;c.</hi> He deſires to
know the reaſons upon which this <hi>Decree</hi> was
grounded, which he ſaith, in the concluſion of
his Examination, <hi>p. 46. had much better have bin
thought on at firſt, and then we ſhould have eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
this Decree:</hi> Intimating thereby, what he
had in broad words expreſſed before, that it was
<hi>a raſh injudicious Cenſure,</hi> neither managed with
conſideration, nor ſupported by any good reaſon.</p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs for my own part, I do not ſee
any juſt ground why we ſhould comply with this
Examiner's expectation. For reaſons have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
bin offered by the Learned <hi>Animadverter,</hi>
and thoſe penned with ſuch a ſtrength and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
as are peculiar to his writings. But he ſaith,
he cannot perſwade himſelf to read what the
<hi>Animadverter</hi> hath written on this occaſion. To
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:65402:18"/>
what purpoſe therefore is it to offer any new Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
which muſt all be loſt, upon one, who
ſuperciliouſly diſdains to peruſe and conſider,
what either hath, or what may hereafter be cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably
propoſed for his conviction? But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he, who reſolved never to read whatever
ſhould be written by the <hi>Animadverter,</hi> may
perhaps caſt a ſcornful glance on theſe papers, I
ſhall therefore ſo far gratify him in his demand,
as to offer him one Reaſon againſt his <hi>three Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances</hi>
in the bleſſed Trinity, but it ſhall be a
<hi>ſubſtantial one,</hi> and ſuch as moſt men I am ſure,
will look upon to be as conſiderable, and as ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
to ſhew the falſhood and impiety of his
opinion, as if twenty were propoſed. And that
is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That if there be <hi>three diſtinct ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,</hi>
(and the ſame is to be ſaid of <hi>three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
minds and Spirits)</hi> in the Trinity, then
there muſt unavoidably be three Gods.</p>
            <p>This hath bin ſo plainly and irrefragably al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
made out by the Learned <hi>Animadverter,</hi>
that if the <hi>Dean</hi> would have vouchſafed to have
ſpent that time in reading and examining the
<hi>Animadverſions,</hi> which he hath miſpent in exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
the <hi>Oxford Decree,</hi> it would have ſpared
any farther trouble or pains in this affair.</p>
            <p>Now for a farther proof and confirmation of
this reaſon, I ſhall lay down ſome obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:65402:19"/>
which carry ſuch a plainneſs and evidence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with them, as cannot I think be gainſaid or
reſiſted, but by ſuch who are before-hand reſolved
to perſiſt in their errors, and are hardned againſt
all conviction. Such as <hi>1st.</hi> That the <hi>Exiſtence
and Unity of the Godhead,</hi> is the firſt and Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
principle of all Religion, both revealed
and natural. And conſequently that there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be more Gods than one, in any ſenſe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever;
if the word God be taken in its <hi>proper,</hi>
and not in a <hi>Metaphorical and Figurative</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.
That therefore which I affirm is, that
there are not more Gods than one, either Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
or Inferior; Coordinate or Subordinate;
Numerical or Specifical; Ancient or Modern.
<hi>Hear, O Iſrael, the Lord our God is one Lord,</hi>
Deut. 6. 4. <hi>The Lord he is God, and there is
none elſe beſides him,</hi> Deut 4. 35. But this is
the dictate of nature as well as the language of
the Scripture; <hi>Reaſon</hi> (I mean where it is not
corrupted and depraved) and <hi>Revelation</hi> both
conſpiring to teach us this Leſſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly,</hi> That, there being but one God, from
thence it muſt follow, that in God there muſt
be but one <hi>nature,</hi> one <hi>eſſence.</hi> Becauſe <hi>eſſence</hi>
is that by which every thing is conſtituted that
which it is: it is the <hi>ratio formalis</hi> of that thing
be it what it will, <hi>&amp; primo de re concipitur,</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:65402:19"/>
being the firſt thing that offers it ſelf to our
thoughts, when we form an Idea of it. One
eſſence, one nature, conſtitutes one thing; Two
natures, two or more eſſences, conſtitute two
or more things. Where there is one human or
Angelical nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there is but one man, one An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel.
Where there are two or more, there are
two or more men or Angels: <hi>Peter, and John,
Michael, and Gabriel.</hi> And ſo for the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
there being but one God, there can be but
one divine eſſence; and if more eſſences, more
Gods.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly,</hi> That when we ſpeak of God, the words
<hi>Eſſence, Nature, Substance, Divinity,</hi> are <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonymous</hi>
terms, and ſignify one and the ſame
thing. Thus in the Fathers, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, are
promiſcuouſly uſed to denote the divine nature,
or Godhead. The Divine <hi>Nature, Eſſence, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi>
being nothing elſe but the <hi>Deity or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity:</hi>
and the <hi>Divinity,</hi> vice verſa, is nothing,
but the Divine <hi>Nature, Substance, Eſſence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>4thly,</hi> Therefore, if in the Trinity there are
<hi>three distinct Substances,</hi> there muſt be three
diſtinct Eſſences, and Divinities, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
there muſt be three Gods. For that there is
<hi>one</hi> God, or <hi>more</hi> Gods than one, muſt depend
upon the <hi>Unity</hi> or <hi>Multiplication</hi> of the divine
nature and eſſence. If there be but one divine
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:65402:20"/>
               <hi>Nature, Substance, Divinity,</hi> there is, and for that
reaſon it is impoſſible there ſhould be any more
than <hi>one God;</hi> and if more <hi>diſtinct Subſtances and
Divinities,</hi> there muſt be <hi>more Gods.</hi> As the
former are numbred and multiplied, ſo are the
latter; in the ſame proportion, both as to <hi>num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
and kind.</hi> If there be but <hi>three distinct
Substances and Divinities,</hi> there are but three
Gods; and if thoſe Subſtances be only numeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
diſtinguiſhed, then they conſtitute only
three numerical Gods; but if ſpecifically diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed,
then there muſt be three Gods of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
kind, that is ſpecifically diſtinguiſhed from
each other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>5thly,</hi> That the <hi>Unity</hi> of the Godhead is the
moſt <hi>perfect and complete</hi> ſort of Unity that can
be imagined. No Nature, Eſſence, Subſtance,
can in any ſenſe be more <hi>one,</hi> than the Divine
Nature or Eſſence is; which hath ſuch ſo perfect,
and ſo peculiar a <hi>Simplicity and Identity,</hi> as to
exclude all manner of <hi>diviſion,</hi> and all ſorts of
<hi>Multiplication.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true indeed, there is one peculiar preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of the Divine Nature and Subſtance, found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in its infinite, and therefore tranſcendent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
whereby it is capable of reſiding in
more perſons than one; and is accordingly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
from the Father, to the Son, and holy
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:65402:20"/>
Ghoſt. But this is done without any diviſion,
or multiplication; ſo that the <hi>ſame</hi> divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is a <hi>ſingular,</hi> but not a <hi>ſolitary</hi> nature, being
whole and entire in the three bleſſed perſons;
in each of which it doth completely ſubſiſt, tho
with a different manner of ſubſiſtence; yet ſo,
as to retain its moſt <hi>complete Identity,</hi> exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all plurality of eſſences, whether <hi>equal or
unequal, like or unlike;</hi> the Divine nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but one and the ſame, as was ſaid before, in
the three divine perſons, without <hi>diverſity</hi> and
without <hi>diſtinction.</hi> The Perſons indeed are
diſtinguiſhed from each other by a <hi>true, real, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
diſtinction.</hi> But this is not founded in the
diverſity or diſtinction of their <hi>natures,</hi> but is
taken from the different ways of <hi>ſubſiſtence,</hi>
which one and the ſame nature hath in the three
perſons; whereby they have different <hi>properties,
characters, and relations,</hi> which are abſolutely
incommunicable to each other, and whereby
ſome things may be affirmed of one, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
poſſibly be affirmed of either of the others.
Such as are the <hi>generation</hi> of the Son; <hi>the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
and miſſion</hi> of the holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>And in this different manner of ſubſiſtence is
founded, as the <hi>diſtinction,</hi> ſo likewiſe the <hi>ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination</hi>
between the divine Perſons: the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
being the firſt, and therefore ſtyled by the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:65402:21"/>
Fathers, the <hi>Origine and Fountain of the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>
with reſpect to the Son and holy Ghoſt.
Not by the production of a new divine nature,
but by a communication of his own, which, as
the Fathers always ſpeak, is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, one and
the very ſame, in all three, without <hi>ſeparation,
difference, or diſtinction.</hi> This is indeed a great
myſtery, but we ſpeak of the bleſſed Trinity in
Unity, and Unity in Trinity, which hath bin
always looked upon by the greateſt and wiſeſt
men in the Church, to be above all expreſſions
and deſcription. If any man therefore will not
be ſatisfied with this general account, but will
be putting new and nice queſtions, and deſire to
be informed with <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>;
how can theſe things be? Then I muſt
acquaint him once for all, that neither man, nor
Angel can give a ſatisfactory anſwer to ſuch en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries,
which are not only impertinent but dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous;
proceeding from a wanton, and impious
curioſity, which ought ſeverely to be condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
As for us of this place, I hope we ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
endeavor to regulate our apprehenſions in
the affairs of Religion, by the diſcoveries which
God hath made in the holy writings; account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the trueſt wiſdom, when men are <hi>wiſe
according to what is written.</hi> And therefore in
ſpight of all the objections and flouts of <hi>Arians,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:65402:21"/>
Socinians, Tritheiſts, Atheists,</hi> we will reſolve
to <hi>believe what is revealed, and to adore what
we cannot comprehend.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, Since the <hi>Unity</hi> of the divine nature
is ſuch, and ſo perfect as is before deſcribed,
therefore we may conclude, that all thoſe, who
attempt to explain it by a <hi>ſpecifical ſameneſs and
identity,</hi> are ſo far from confirming that they
plainly undermine this great and fundamental
truth.</p>
            <p>For <hi>1ſt,</hi> hereby they deſtroy a true <hi>real Unity,</hi>
and in the room of it, introduce only a <hi>notional
Unity,</hi> which may be conſiſtent with, nay indeed,
as the Dean hath bin told, implys a multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the divine nature. So that when we
ſay the <hi>three perſons are one God,</hi> they are no
otherwiſe <hi>one</hi> according to this explication, than
as ten thouſand individual men, are one man,
or a myriad of Angels, are one Angel.</p>
            <p>Neither is it enough to ſay, that the three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
natures and ſubſtances are <hi>United in the
Trinity;</hi> but are <hi>ſeparated or divided</hi> in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of Angels and men. For this will not alter
the caſe; for the <hi>three ſubstances</hi> ſo united, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
their true and real diſtinction from each
other, notwithſtanding that Union, and are
ſtill as much three as if they were not united.
And therefore this <hi>Union</hi> of natures will no more

conſtitute <hi>one nature,</hi> than the <hi>Union</hi> of the <hi>three
perſons</hi> in the <hi>Trinity,</hi> who are moſt intimately,
and inſeparably united to each other, will make
<hi>one perſon;</hi> or than the Union of both natures
<hi>Divine and Humane,</hi> in our bleſſed Savior, will
conſtitute and make one nature. <hi>Eutyches</hi> of old
maintained ſuch a ſenſeleſs opinion; but the
Fathers told him, that thoſe natures were united,
it is true, but yet, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, without
confuſion, alteration, or converſion of either into
the other. So that each nature retained its own
powers, faculties and properties, entire and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
from thoſe of the other, without any mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
or change.</p>
            <p>The like is to be ſaid, of the union of ſeveral
eſſences and natures in the Trinity. For ſhould
ſuch an union be allowed, yet ſtill the natures
muſt remain entire and diſtinct; and ſo muſt
their attributes likewiſe. They muſt have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
underſtandings, and wills, and diſtinct
operations, as flowing from powers and facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
eſſentially diſtinguiſhed; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they muſt be <hi>three Gods</hi> to all intents and
purpoſes, when <hi>united,</hi> as much as if they were
<hi>ſeparated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>2dly,</hi> A <hi>ſpecifical ſameneſs</hi> of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
is by no means to be allowed, becauſe it
deſtroys the true and fundamental reaſon of that
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:65402:22"/>
unity, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>infinite perfection</hi> of the divine
nature, which renders it abſolutely incapable of
any <hi>multiplication;</hi> and places it upon another
weak and unſtable foundation; <hi>viz.</hi> the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the mind and underſtanding. So that
the unity of the Godhead according to ths hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis,
doth not reſult from the nature of God,
but is owing to, and dependent upon the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of ſome intellect, drawing one common no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from the agreement which it obſerves in
ſeveral individuals. Which to affirm would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
be both a monſtrous and a Blaſphemous
aſſertion; ss the <hi>Animadverter hath very judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly
obſerved, p.</hi> 183.</p>
            <p>From all theſe obſervations, I think it is as
evident as any truth in nature, that to aſſert
<hi>three ſubstances</hi> in the bleſſed Trinity, is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to imply, and in other words to affirm, that
there are <hi>three Gods;</hi> which aſſertion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in the judgment not only of all <hi>true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi>
but even of <hi>Jews and Mahometans,</hi> and
ſome <hi>ſober Pagans,</hi> would be accounted and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
<hi>falſe and impious,</hi> as it is declared to be
by the <hi>Oxford Cenſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But againſt this the Dean will urge in behalf
of his <hi>three diſtinct ſubstances;</hi> the plurality and
diſtinction of perſons in the Trinity. Are there
not three Perſons in the Godhead? Yes. Are
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:65402:23"/>
not theſe three Perſons three <hi>ſubſtantial Perſons?</hi>
Yes, we acknowledge they are. Tho by the by,
this epithet of <hi>ſubſtantial</hi> when added to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
is ſuperfluous, and is no better than a plain
tautology; becauſe the very notion of Perſon
imports the perfection and complement of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
ſo that it receives no addition to its ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
by the word ſubſtantial.</p>
            <p>But to paſs this by, and proceed to his que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions:
Are not three ſubſtantial perſons, <hi>three
diſtinct ſubſtances?</hi> I anſwer, no. For theſe three
perſons have but <hi>one and the ſame ſubstance,</hi> or
nature that is common to them all; which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
hath <hi>three different ways of ſubſiſting</hi> in the
three perſons. From which different ways of
ſubſiſting, as I ſaid before, do reſult <hi>diſtinct pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties,
and relations,</hi> belonging to each of thoſe
divine perſons, and which are incommunicable
to the others. All theſe queſtions ſo often and ſo
impertinently propoſed by the Dean, are eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
by propoſing the like queſtions, in other
words, but ſuch as are, perfectly equipollent.</p>
            <p>Are not the Perſons in the Trinity three diſtinct
<hi>Divine</hi> Perſons? Yes. Is not every divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
truly and properly God? Yes. Is it not then
as plain, that if there be three diſtinct divine
Perſons, there muſt conſequenty be three Gods?
I anſwer, no. Becauſe, tho each of them diſtinctly
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:65402:23"/>
is a divine Perſon, and therefore God; yet they
have but <hi>one and the ſame Divinity or Godhead</hi>
in common to them all: ſo that they are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
only by their perſonalities, but are united
in one divine nature or Godhead. And therefore,
as the <hi>Athanaſian</hi> Creed tells us, <hi>tho we are
compelled by the Christian verity to acknowledge
every Perſon by himſelf to be God and Lord;
yet we are forbidden by the Catholick Religion,
to ſay there are three Gods, or three Lords.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now of all this I would defire no greater or
plainer acknowledgment, than what I find in the
writings of this examiner, and particularly in the
papers before us. p. 18. he hath theſe words:
<hi>That there are three Perſons and one God, is
the Catholick Language, and therefore three be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to the Perſons,</hi> and <hi>one to the Godhead.</hi>
This is right: but in the words immediately ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding,
he quite overturns the Catholick Faith
and Language, by ſaying: <hi>That therefore what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is eſſential to the notion of each Perſon, may
be numbred and distinguiſhed with the Perſons.</hi>
From hence he would have it follow, as indeed
it will, if this be allowed, that <hi>ſpirit and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi>
being included in the notion of a Perſon,
it muſt be <hi>multiplied</hi> with it, ſo that as there
<hi>are three Perſons,</hi> ſo there muſt be <hi>three ſpirits,
three ſubstances,</hi> in the Trinity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:65402:24"/>
Now this is extremely falſe; for by the ſame
way, and for the ſame reaſon that there are three
ſubſtances or three ſpirits, there muſt be three
Godheads. He ſaith no: adding that this will not
affect the <hi>unity of the Godhead;</hi> for <hi>three,</hi> he ſaith,
<hi>belongs to the perſons, which are three, not to
the Godhead, which is but one:</hi> very right. And
muſt it not be ſaid for the ſame reaſon, that when
we affirm that there are <hi>three ſubstantial</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<hi>three</hi> is to be applied to <hi>Perſons,</hi> and
not to <hi>ſubstance;</hi> becauſe <hi>ſubstance</hi> when we
ſpeak of God, being equipollent to <hi>Godhead,</hi> as
was ſaid before, is but <hi>one,</hi> and therefore cannot
be <hi>multiplied?</hi> But cannot what is eſſential to
the notion of a perſon, be numbred and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
with the perſon? No, by no means; for
tho it may and muſt be ſo in <hi>finite perſons,</hi> it
is not ſo when we ſpeak of the divine <hi>infinite
perſons</hi> in the Trinity. Becauſe there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in each of thoſe perſons, which in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
belongs to them all; ſuch is the divine <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
ſubſtance, Godhead,</hi> which is ſo in each as
to be <hi>whole and entire</hi> in all three; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
tho reſiding in, and applied to each perſon,
yet it may not, it cannot be numbred or diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
with the perſons; who are diſtinguiſhed
by their properties and relations, which ariſe
from three different ways &amp; manners of their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:65402:24"/>
but not by their <hi>ſubſtance</hi> and Godhead,
which is but one and the ſame in all three, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>diviſion, distinction, or multiplication.</hi> The
ſame orthodox acknowledgment we have, p. 21.
tho tacked by him, according to his uſual me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
to an egregious contradiction. There he
ſaith: <hi>that the divine nature is whole and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
in each divine Perſon; and that infinite,
and infinite, and infinite, when applied to the
Perſons, are but one and the ſame infinite na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
Very right: but then with the ſame breath
in a manner he puffs all this away; by telling us,
that <hi>each of the divine Perſons is a diſtinct infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
mind; and yet that theſe three infinite di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
minds can have but one and the ſame di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
nature.</hi> Which is a plain contradiction,
making one to be three, and three one, in one
and the ſame reſpect. And is no better than if
he ſhould ſay, in three Gods, there is but one
and the ſame Godhead; for infinite mind and
ſpirit is but the ſame thing in other words with
God, as he himſelf elſewhere acknowledges.</p>
            <p>Laſtly to mention no more, p. 29, 30. He repeats
the ſame orthodox expreſſions: <hi>The Scripture-no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Unity of God is not ſuch an Unity as
is only in one Perſon, for then it could not enjoyn
the Faith and worſhip of Father, Son, and holy
Ghost. But ſuch an Unity as can be between
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:65402:25"/>
three: when the one ſame divine nature, is
wholly and entirely communicated by the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Father, to the eternal Son, and by the Father
and the Son, to the eternal Spirit, without any
diviſion or ſeparation. And that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
whole and entire, without diviſion or
ſeparation, makes no number, for it is but one still.</hi>
Here he is as ſound and orthodox as <hi>Athanaſius;</hi>
but when he comes to explain himſelf, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
to give us his true ſentiments, (for all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
expreſſions, are but an artificial diſguiſe of
his errors) then he uſes ſuch a <hi>ſhuffing, ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous,
deceitful</hi> way of ſpeaking, that you would
think, that <hi>Urſacius,</hi> or <hi>Valens,</hi> or <hi>Euſebius</hi> of
<hi>Nicomedia,</hi> were riſen from the dead.</p>
            <p>I confeſs I have bin beyond meaſure aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
when I have peruſed his writings on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
to find ſuch plain and groſs contradictions,
ſo often and ſo boldly uttered by him. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
he will make a good and laudable confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the Faith; and by and by he ſpoils all, by
a very <hi>fraudulent and treacherous explication.</hi>
And indeed hereby he hath laid the foundations
of ſuch a ſophiſtical and deceitful way of writing;
that if it ſhould be countenanced in him, and
thereupon imitated by others, it would render it
almoſt impoſſible, either to <hi>vindicate the truth,</hi>
or to <hi>confute any Hereſy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:65402:25"/>
This charge will be made good by conſidering
theſe following particulars. Such as are <hi>1ſt,</hi>
his manifeſt, and manifold contradictions, with
which his books written upon the ſubject, which
is now before us, do every where abound. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he affirms and denys the ſame thing, almoſt
in a breath; and what he erects in one place, he
preſently kicks down in another. To make out
this, I ſhall confine my ſelf to one inſtance of it,
relating to the Unity of the divine nature, p. 21.
He ſaith the <hi>Divine nature is whole and entire
in each divine perſon, and the three divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi>
whom <hi>he</hi> very falſly and very dangerouſly
there calls three divine minds, <hi>have the ſame one
divine nature, and are but one and the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
nature.</hi> p. 29. <hi>There is but one and the
ſame divinity or Godhead in them all,</hi> ſpeaking of
the three perſons. <hi>The ſame one divinity or God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
is entirely and indiviſibly in three distinct
perſons.</hi> p. 30. <hi>The ſame one divine nature is
wholly and entirely communicated from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the Son, &amp;c.</hi> See p. 45. where you have
the like expreſſions, by which he affirms that
there is but one and the ſame nature, one Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
one Godhead in the three Perſons. And
yet in other places, he is as confident, that there
is not <hi>only one ſingular nature, and ſubstance in
God;</hi> p. 16. <hi>To ſay that there is one ſingular
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:65402:26"/>
ſubstance in the Deity is the fundamental Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of the Sabellian Creed.</hi> p. 17. <hi>If there be but
one ſingular divine nature and ſubstance in the
Deity, tho men could find a Trinity of Perſons
in this one</hi> divine <hi>nature</hi> (which yet p. 16. he
repreſents as a ridiculous imagination) yet from
thence he ſaith it muſt follow, <hi>that the whole
Trinity must be incarnate, p.</hi> 23. Now to affirm that
there is but one Godhead, one and the ſame di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
nature in the three Perſons; and yet to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
that there is one ſingular divine nature and
ſubſtance in thoſe perſons, I think, amounts to
a very plain contradiction.</p>
            <p>I know it will be ſaid, that he affirms and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
the Unity of the divine nature, but it is not
in <hi>the ſame reſpect:</hi> when he ſaith it is <hi>one,</hi> he
means that the ſame <hi>ſpecifical nature</hi> is whole
and entire in the three Perſons; but when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
it to be <hi>one,</hi> he means, that there is not <hi>one
only ſingular, or numerical divine nature,</hi> for
this were, by ſo ſaying, to revive the Hereſy of
<hi>Sabellius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Anſwer, this will not ſave him from a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.
For let him make choice of which of
theſe terms he pleaſes to expreſs the Unity and
ſameneſs of the divine nature by, it is certain,
that what he affirms in one place he denies in
another. When he ſaith it is <hi>one, one and the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:65402:26"/>
ſame,</hi> doth he mean <hi>one ſingular, numerical na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?</hi>
if he means ſo, then this he doth at other
times in plain downright terms deny, not only
as a thing that is falſe, but as <hi>Heretical, impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
contradictory,</hi> as was ſeen before. Well?
when he aſſerts the Unity of the Godhead, and
ſaith, <hi>that one and the ſame divine nature is in
the three Perſons, wholly and entirely commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
from the Father to the Son,</hi> as he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
himſelf, p. 30. doth he mean a <hi>ſpecifical
Identity?</hi> I ſuppoſe he doth, for p. 10. he tells us
that <hi>to aſſert three ſubſtances in the Arian no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that is three distinct minds and ſpecies of
ſubstance, or three natures and eſſences ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
different, this is falſe, impious, and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical.</hi>
Therefore to affirm three natures of the
ſame kind, muſt be a true, religious, orthodox
acknowledgment.</p>
            <p>This he muſt mean if he means any thing.
Otherwiſe if he ſhall ſay, that when he affirms
there are three natures, or ſubſtances, he means,
that there are three, but yet which are neither
of the ſame kind nor of a different kind; that is,
neither numerically, nor ſpecifically different:
Then I ſay that he advances an abſurd and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>explicable
poſition, which neither he nor any
man elſe can poſſibly underſtand. But on the
other hand, if he affirms or means a <hi>ſpecifical
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:65402:27"/>
Unity</hi> in the Godhead, then I am ſure he doth
as plainly as words can make it, in other places
contradict his meaning. For p. 19. He hath theſe
words, <hi>Tho the Ancient Fathers frequenty make
mention of a ſpecifick Unity of nature in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
yet they did not confine the Unity of the
divine nature to this.</hi> And p. 33. <hi>This ſpecifick
ſameneſs doth not anſwer the complete notion of
the divine Unity.</hi> Nay, he doth not only ſay
this, but gives a very good reaſon for it. p. 19.
<hi>The divine nature is no ſpecies, for it is but
one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If there be any force in this conſequence, it
muſt be this <hi>viz.</hi> That the divine nature is but
one <hi>ſingular individual nature,</hi> which is incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of plurality or multiplication, and therefore
it cannot be a <hi>ſpecies,</hi> becauſe a <hi>ſpecies,</hi> can be
multiplied, and therefore is capable of being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
and predicated <hi>de pluribus,</hi> of more things
of the ſame kind. He proceeds: <hi>The Unity of
the Godhead is the moſt real, eſſential, indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
unity.</hi> Very right. Therefore ſay I, it is not a
ſpecifical Unity, the former aſſertion being a clear
&amp; an unanſwerable proof that it is not ſo: For <hi>1ſt,</hi>
The Unity of the Godhead is <hi>a real Unity;</hi> but a
ſpecifick Unity, is only a <hi>Logical and Notional one.
2dly,</hi> The unity of the Godhead, is an <hi>eſsential
unity,</hi> the unity of one <hi>nature and eſsence;</hi> the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:65402:27"/>
ſpecifick is only an <hi>unity of ſeveral natures,</hi> which
are really and eſſentially, <hi>à parte rei,</hi> diſtinct
from each other, and are only united in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.
<hi>Laſtly,</hi> The unity of the Godhead
is the <hi>most real,</hi> and therefore the moſt perfect
unity; but a ſpecifick unity is not the <hi>most real,</hi>
but of a leſſer ſort, and much inferior to a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
and numerical Identity. It is this latter then
that is to be found in the Godhead, which being
uncapable of <hi>diviſion, or multiplication,</hi> is for the
ſame reaſon, as he himſelf acknowledges, uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of <hi>numeration.</hi> For <hi>when we ſay three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
Three belongs to the perſons who are three,
but not to the Godhead, which is but one, p.</hi> 18.</p>
            <p>And now is it not plain to any man, that the
<hi>Dean,</hi> by thus going forward and backward,
ſaying and unſaying, very evidently contradicts
himſelf? I think he doth. But if this wants any
farther confirmation, let the Reader look into
his Vindication, and there he will find theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions
yet in more plain and expreſs terms,
if it be poſſible, which the Reader may find ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplified
in the <hi>Animadverſions, p. 178. &amp;c.</hi>
and thither I refer him, to ſave the trouble of
tranſcribing.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Dean</hi> for all this, will not allow that
he is guilty of a contradiction; and therefore to
ſave himſelf from that imputation he hath con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trived
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:65402:28"/>
two Anſwers, but they are the moſt bold
and arbitrary, that ever were invented. But
when men are hard preſſed, it is no wonder that
they ſhould make uſe of any the moſt deſperate
ſhift to make their eſcape.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt</hi> then, Doth not he who aſſerts the unity of
the Godhead, and yet tells the world, that this is
neither a ſpecifick nor a numerical unity (for of
a Generical one, there is no queſtion in this caſe)
I ſay doth not ſuch an one contradict himſelf?
Surely he doth. For if God be one, he muſt be ſo in
either of theſe two ſenſes. And therefore if the
Godhead be one, and yet is neither numerically
nor ſpecifically ſuch, it muſt be one, and not one,
which is a contradiction.</p>
            <p>He anſwers no, becauſe there is an unity that is
a medium between both. The unity of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
is not ſuch as is to be found in a <hi>ſingular na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
that is,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Sabellianiſm,</hi> neither is it a
<hi>ſpecifick unity,</hi> for that is only a Logical and noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
unity, and <hi>therefore the unity of the divine
nature is not to be confined to this,</hi> p. 19. <hi>In op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
to the Arians the Fathers taught, not one
ſingular ſubſtance in God, which is Sabellianiſm.
But ſuch an oneneſs of ſubſtance as we know not
how otherwiſe to expreſs, than by a ſpecifick ſame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and unity, tho that doth not anſwer the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete
notion of the Divine unity,</hi> p. 33. In ſhort,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:65402:28"/>
the Divine nature is one, but by what kind of
unity no man can divine. It is neither a ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
nor a numerical oneneſs, but an unity either
made up of both, or made up of neither; howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it is a medium between them. I fancy ſuch
another medium, as he found who deſired the
people to join with him in ſinging the <hi>Pſalm,</hi> that
was between the three and twentieth, and the
twenty fourth <hi>Pſalms.</hi> But if this Anſwer will
not bring him off, he hath contrived a ſecond, <hi>viz.</hi>
that theſe three numerical ſubſtances are united
into one, by a <hi>mutual ſelf-conſciouſneſs.</hi> But for
this notion of his the <hi>Animadverter</hi> hath ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently-accounted
with him: and therefore there
remains nothing more by me to be ſaid upon
that Head.</p>
            <p>Thus it is plain that the <hi>Dean</hi> in his writings is
guilty of many groſs and palpable contradictions,
which way of writing is very ſcandalous, and
ought therefore by every one to be condemned.
But this is not all; there are ſeveral other things
in his way &amp; manner of writing, which ought
to be diſcountenanced: I can but juſt name
them. Any man that peruſes his late writings,
will beſides his contradictions, find in the <hi>2d</hi>
place, that he frequently, but very fraudulently,
endeavors to impoſe upon his Readers, by make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
two words to be <hi>equipollent,</hi> which yet have
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:65402:29"/>
a <hi>different ſignification.</hi> Thus in order to amuſe
unwary Readers, when he ſpeaks of the divine
nature, he joins the words <hi>ſingular and ſolitary</hi>
together, as if they were ſynonymous terms;
and then inſidiouſly asks, p. 17. <hi>Is it not Sabel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianiſm
to affirm that there is but one ſingular
and ſolitary nature in the Trinity?</hi> Anſwer, To
affirm that there is but one <hi>ſolitary nature,</hi> is to
revive the Hereſy of <hi>Sabellius;</hi> becauſe it were
as much as to ſay, that the divine nature or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
is to be found only in, and therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
to one Perſon. But to ſay there is but one
<hi>ſingular nature</hi> imports no ſuch thing. For the
ſame ſingular numerical nature is to be found
in each of the divine Perſons, being common to
them all, but yet without multiplication, as he
hath often bin told by his Adverſary, and which
thing he hath often affirmed himſelf; how ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
let others judge.</p>
            <p>So again, in order to eſtabliſh a plurality of
ſubſtances, he makes <hi>three ſubſtantial perſons,</hi>
to be the ſame with <hi>three perſonal ſubstances.</hi>
But he hath bin often told, that tho the perſons
are different, each of which is a ſubſtance; yet
that the ſubſtance or nature is not diſtinct, but
common to all three. And therefore three ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial
Perſons, are no more three ſubſtances,
than three divine Almighty Perſons, have three
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:65402:29"/>
diſtinct Divinities or Almightineſſes; which he
himſelf ſometimes will not allow.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly,</hi> When hard preſſed by his Adverſary, to
defend himſelf, he invents ſeveral <hi>arbitrary and
incomprehenſible distinctions,</hi> for which he hath
neither reaſon nor example. Thus when told
that three ſubſtances, muſt infer a multiplication
of the divine nature in the Trinity, &amp; that again
muſt infer three Gods: to avoid the force of this
Argument, he tells us, that the ſame <hi>Individual
nature ſubſiſts thrice, not by multiplying but by
repeating its ſelf,</hi> and <hi>that the divine nature is
repeated in its Image, but without multiplication.</hi>
And this ſenſeleſs diſtinction he often repeats in
<hi>his defence;</hi> by which it is certain that he mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplies
words, tho perhaps he may think that he
doth not multiply diſtinctions. Again, having
denied a <hi>Numerical Unity</hi> of the Godhead, and
yet being aware, that a <hi>Specifical Unity</hi> would
lay him open to many unanſwerable difficulties;
he hath in a moſt preſumtuous, unprecedented
manner, formed a diſtinction as to Identity and
ſameneſs of nature, by which he makes a middle
ſort of Unity between the two former, partly
ſpecifick, and partly numerical. Which diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
is perfectly an Original, and for which he
hath neither copy, nor precedent, from any wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
either living or dead.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:65402:30"/>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> In the ſame inſidious manner, to avoid
the force of thoſe Arguments which are brought
againſt him; when he cannot maintain his <hi>words,</hi>
he flies to his <hi>meaning,</hi> where he entrenches him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and then he is as ſafe as if he were in an <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted
Castle.</hi> And there let him continue for
me, unmoleſted and undiſturb'd, provided that
he will no longer diſturb the world, with ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtifiable
a practice; for if men may be allowed
by a <hi>mental reſervation</hi> to harbor a meaning dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from the plain, obvious and natural ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification
of words, then there is an end of all
truth and ſincerity, and conſequently of all mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
confidence between man and man, which
by <hi>this means,</hi> or ſuch <hi>meaning,</hi> if you pleaſe, is
entirely deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>By all that hath bin ſaid upon this Head, I think
it will appear plain to every unprejudiced per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
that there was great reaſon to condemn the
<hi>Propoſitions</hi> mentioned in the <hi>Decree,</hi> which
plainly overthrow the Unity of the Godhead;
and therefore are juſtly ſtyled <hi>falſe, and impious.</hi>
Of them it is farther affirmed in the Decree, that
they are <hi>contrary to the Doctrine of the Catholick
Church; and particularly to that received here
in the Church of England.</hi> And ſo they are, as
oppoſite to it, as truth is to falſhood, and faith
to infidelity. It hath bin the belief and profeſſion
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:65402:30"/>
of all good Chriſtians, ſince the firſt planting of
Chriſtianity in the world, that as there is but
one God, ſo there is but one nature and eſſence in
the three perſons of the Trinity, of which they
are all partakers. This was upon a particular oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
Decreed in the <hi>Council of Nice,</hi> confirmed
afterwards by all the other <hi>General Councils;</hi> and
they who have oppoſed this determination have
in all times heretofore bin adjudged and declared
Hereticks.</p>
            <p>For ſome time indeed, the words <hi>Subſtance,
Perſon, and Hypoſtaſis,</hi> were of ambiguous ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
but that was afterwards ſettled; and
the Language of the Church, ever ſince hath
bin <hi>Three perſons,</hi> and but one <hi>Subſtance, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
Eſſence, Divinity.</hi> In this all the Fathers
agree, both Greek and Latin, even St. <hi>Hilary,</hi>
who ſtyles the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, three
ſubſtances, yet in the very ſame place where he is
cited by the Examiner, he explains himſelf, and
vindicates the Synod of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and tells us p. 37.
<hi>Tres ſubſtantias eſſe dixerunt, ſubſiſtentium per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonas
per ſubſtantias edocentes;</hi> by three ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
they meant three perſons. But as to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
it ſelf when placed in oppoſition to perſon,
he acknowledges that to be but one; and that the
Father and ſon, <hi>unius recte ambo creduntur eſſe
eſſentiae.</hi> Again: <hi>Credamus &amp; dicamus eſſe unum
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:65402:31"/>
ſubstantiam.</hi> p. 39. and p. 40. <hi>Deus unus, ob in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcretae
in utroque naturae indiſſimilem ſubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam
praedicetur.</hi> Which the <hi>Examiner</hi> thus ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
into Engliſh: <hi>The Father who begets, and
the Son who is born, are to be acknowledged one
God, upon the account of the ſame nature in
both, without the least difference or variation;</hi>
and therefore, ſay I, without the leaſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
except the <hi>Dean</hi> can find out <hi>a diſtinction
without a difference,</hi> which I confeſs he hath
done in ſome other caſes before mentioned. But
this is his peculiar talent, to find out that which
no body before him ever dreamed of.</p>
            <p>The like obſervation is to be made with rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the <hi>Alexandrian Synod</hi> under <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius;</hi>
which one would think he would never
have mentioned, if he had not in a manner bin
forſaken by his reaſon, at the ſame time that he
abandoned his Religion. For nothing could have
bin produced, which is more appoſite and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent,
to overthrow his new notion of <hi>three
minds and ſubstances.</hi> For there happened a
diſpute between the Catholicks, concerning <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which was meerly a
contention about words, when they all agreed
in the ſame thing; thoſe who aſſerted <hi>three Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postaſes,</hi>
thereby meaning three Perſons, but yet
but one Godhead, and one ſubſtance in the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:65402:31"/>
thoſe who denied there were three <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtaſes,</hi>
thought that by <hi>Hypostaſis</hi> was meant
ſubſtance, and they dreaded nothing more, than
to affirm there were three ſubſtances in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.</p>
            <p>Take it in the words of the <hi>Examiner,</hi> p. 43.
<hi>They owned but one Hypoſtaſis or ſubstance, for
they believed but one 'Divinity or Divine nature,
by reaſon of the Identity of nature, between
Father and Son. And they having given their
ſeveral Explications, were all found to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
in the Catholick Faith; and then</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>three Hypostaſes and one nature was the
Catholick Language.</hi> Can any thing be more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
oppoſite to his notion, than this Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the Synod. One cannot but think he
was Infatuated when he produced it. But ſtill
he hath a ſhift in reſerve to ſave himſelf and his
three ſubſtances. For in that ſame place, he ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> by ſubſtance, and ſaith, that when
they ſaid <hi>three Hypostaſes,</hi> they meant it <hi>still in
the notion of three ſubstances.</hi> A very falſe and
perfidious ſuggeſtion; making the Catholick Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
as he himſelf acknowledges it, wherein
Catholicks expreſſed their conſent in the ſame
Faith, to conſiſt in a ridiculous contradiction.
For according to him, when they ſaid, <hi>three Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtaſes</hi>
and one nature, they meant <hi>three ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,</hi>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:65402:32"/>
and <hi>one nature;</hi> that is, three ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and one ſubſtance; three natures, and one
nature; theſe being two words that ſignify but
one and the ſame thing.</p>
            <p>But the true Language of the Church was,
that there are <hi>three Perſons,</hi> truly and really
diſtinct, and yet but <hi>one nature, eſſence, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</hi>
And this doctrine hath bin conſtantly,
uniformly, and without any alteration conveyed
thro all the Ages of the Church to our days;
this being the Faith, and theſe the words, of all
Chriſtian Churches, <hi>Greek and Latin, Eaſtern
and Weſtern,</hi> that are at this day in the World.
And particularly of our own Church, who in
the firſt Article of our Religion teaches us to
profeſs, <hi>that there is but one God; and that in
the Unity of this Godhead, there are three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
of one power, ſubstance, and eternity.</hi> And
in our moſt ſolemn addreſſes to Heaven, ſhe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects
us to make the ſame acknowledgment, <hi>viz.</hi>
upon Trinity Sunday; and to give glory to God
in theſe words: <hi>Who art one God, one Lord, not
one only Perſon, but three Perſons in one ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.
For that which we believe of the glory of
the Father, the ſame we believe of the Son, and
holy Ghost, without any difference or inequality.</hi>
And if there be not any <hi>difference</hi> in the ſubſtance,
there can be no <hi>diſtinction,</hi> as was ſaid before.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:65402:32"/>
And now at length being quite tired with fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
this <hi>Examiner,</hi> thro that maze and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinth,
into which he commonly leads his
Readers: it is high time I ſhould take leave
of him, after I have committed him to the
mercy of God, and his writings to the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of the Church. The former I hope he
will partake of; the latter perhaps he and
they may eſcape, tho he ſtands in great need
of it, eſpecially ſince he ſo obſtinately and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinaciouſly
perſiſts in his errors, after ſo plain
a diſcovery, and ſo clear a confutation of
them.</p>
            <p>But I cannot fairly part with him, without
enquiring into the reaſons, which induced him
to publiſh this Paper, wherein he treats the
Governors of the Univerſity, in ſo rude and
inſolent a manner; falling foul upon perſons,
whoſe Character, Profeſſion, and Station he
ought to have conſidered; and from whom he
never received the leaſt perſonal injury or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation,
that ever I could yet hear of. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
other Reaſons, he hath ſuggeſted one in
the laſt page of this Book, which I ſhall only
take notice of, viz. <hi>That it was impoſſible for
him to do otherwiſe than he hath done, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
he wonld be content to be trampled upon
by every Scribler.</hi> Now this is a reaſon, I
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:65402:33"/>
think, that is wholly owing to his Guilt, and
ſome unreaſonable fears which are conſequent
thereupon. Sure he is conſcious to himſelf
that his credit runs low, and that he is much
fallen in the eſteem of many who formerly
had a good opinion of him. He is ſenſible
that his Adverſary hath foiled him, which ſome
perhaps may call <hi>running him down;</hi> and now
he is afraid that the by-ſtanders ſhould trample
upon him.</p>
            <p>What perſons who are abroad may do, I
cannot tell; but as for the members whether
<hi>ſcriblers or no ſcriblers</hi> of the Univerſity, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
this <hi>Humiliation,</hi> I am apt to
think that they never intended to inſult over
him, eſpecially if he had not publiſhed this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent
Paper. But this phraſe of treading and
<hi>trampling,</hi> brings to my mind the ſtory that
<hi>Socrates</hi> tells of that famous Rhetorician <hi>Ece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolius;</hi>
a man much talked of in the days in
which he lived, and who by his levity and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy
in the profeſſion of Religion, hath
given occaſion to be much talked of ever ſince.
This man, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modating
himſelf, as the Hiſtorian tells us, <hi>Socr.
Hist. Eccl. Lib. 3. cap.</hi> 13. to the manners and
inclinations of the Emperors under whom he
lived, in <hi>Conſtantius</hi>'s time was a zealous Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:65402:33"/>
but an <hi>Arian,</hi> as <hi>Baronius</hi> thinks, under
<hi>Julian</hi>'s Reign he turned <hi>Apostate,</hi> and proved
a violent Pagan. But after his death, he was
deſirous to embrace once again the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and to be admitted into the ſociety and
communion of the Faithful. But being ſenſible
that his prevarications had rendered him unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of that favor, he made uſe of this notable ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem,
to move the compaſſion of Chriſtians:
He laies himſelf proſtrate before the doors of the
Church, and beſpeaks thoſe who were entering
into it, in thoſe emphatical words, <hi>conculcate me,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>ſalem inſipidum infatuatum,</hi> good
Chriſtian people, tread me under your feet,
trample upon me, a Lump, <hi>a heap of Salt, which
hath lost its ſavor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now that which I have to add farther upon
occaſion of this ſtory, is only this, in relation to
the Members of the <hi>Univerſity;</hi> for whom, I think,
I durſt undertake, that if any of them ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to find, I will not ſay the <hi>Dean,</hi> but any
tho a much inferior Perſon to Mr. <hi>Dean,</hi> in the
ſame humble penitent poſture, begging pardon for
any the like publick offence and ſcandal, that he
might either by word or deed have given the
Church: I dare be confident, I ſay, there is no
Member of the <hi>Univerſity</hi> would inſult over the
misfortunes of ſuch a penitent. They would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:65402:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
on the other ſide lend him a helping hand,
and would lift him up: they would comfort
him, and give him good words, and bid him
hope for Gods mercy, and the Church's par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
upon the condition of a ſincere repentance.
But I am apt to think likewiſe, they would
add counſel to their conſolations, and would give
him good advice into the bargain. They would
adviſe him to be ſteady for the future in the
practice of his duty; and by no means to play
faſt and looſe with the Faith, or to be guilty
of any the leaſt prevarication in the affairs of
Religion. And in ſhort, I preſume they would
diſmiſs him with thoſe words of our Savior,
<hi>Jo.</hi> 5. 14. Go and <hi>Sin no more lest a worſe
thing come unto thee.</hi>
