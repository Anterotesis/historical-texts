            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the READER.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Had ſo honeſt a Deſign in writing the following Diſcourſe, which I have
endeavoured to compoſe in cool and calm Thoughts undiſturb'd with Heat
or Paſſion, as I am arm'd againſt their Cenſures, who will perhaps reſent
it very ill to ſee their Darling Notions expos'd. My poor Labours are
recommended by the alone conſideration of the Truths, in whoſe Defence they are
employ'd, and this is abundantly ſufficient; and therefore I need only to deſire thee
to conſider the Arguments with an impartial Mind. If thou loveſt the Goſpel, do
not ſuffer thy Thoughts, looking on it, to be diſtorted by Prejudice or Paſſion. As
the Truths here aſſerted are of great moment, ſo they deſerve thy moſt ſerious
Attention. If they were only ſubtle Niceties for a trial of Wit, or to make an
Experiment who could make Words to dance moſt nimbly, I would never have
miſimploy'd my ſelf in writing this Diſcourſe, nor cauſed thee to miſpend ſo
much time in reading it. But ſince I can aſſure thee that I have aſſerted nothing
but what I not only really believe to be true, but to be of high Importance to the
Salvation of my own Soul, (which is very clear Evidence that a Man is in good
Earneſt) I hope thou wilt conſider, whether it may not concern thine too. There
are two great Rocks which threaten the hazard of a Shipwrack, Popery and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minianiſm;
and for my own part I am terribly afraid of coming in any near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to the danger. Popery hath been ſo uncas'd of its Diſguiſe, that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
in its natural figure; and thoſe who know any thing of the Goſpel, ſtartle
at the firſt Entrance of its affrighting Shape: But Arminianiſm ſurprizes the
Vncautious, appearing with a fairer Face and more ſpecious Colour; and yet
really, if the Holy Ghoſt ſpeaks truly to us in the Epiſtles of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi>
(as I am ſure he doth) this almoſt generally belov'd Doctrine is as contrary to
the Goſpel as Popery it ſelf; and if God ſpeaks true, it is undoubted, that
what the Arminians tell us is falſe. God tells us, that <hi>in him we live, and
move, and have our being:</hi> The Arminians would diſpute us out of this great
Privilege, and endeavour to perſwade us, that when God hath once form'd us
and thrown us out of his Hands, we may move alone without him. God teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
us, that he effectually accompliſheth the Counſels of his Will, and that nothing
can obſtruct or fruſtrate the ſucceſs: The Arminians tell us, that God is hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deſirous of the Salvation of all Men, but cannot ſave the greateſt part of
them, becauſe they are unwilling. God plainly tells us his own Mind, that none
are ſaved, but whom he hath eternally ordain'd to that happy State: But the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians
inſinuate, that thoſe may be ſav'd whom God never thought of for ſuch
a Deſign, and that he will be ſurpriz'd at the arrival of new Colonies in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
which he never appointed to come thither. God, who juſtifies the Vngodly,
expreſly declares, that we muſt be juſtified freely of his Grace, not by our own
but Chriſt's Righteouſneſs. The Arminians bring us to a new Court of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
where God ſits not, nor hath any thing to do; for there our Faith in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience 
<pb facs="tcp:49801:3"/>
to the Goſpel, is pleaded inſtead of perfect Obedience owing to the Law, and
the Plea is admitted; for (as that Prodigy of Learning <hi>Grotius</hi> ſpeaks) as a
Work grateful to God, it meets with acceptance. In a Word, their Opinions tear
the Volume of God's Word to pieces, and un-God God himſelf: They pull him
out of his Throne, and ſtrike the Scepter out of his Hands, and ſnatch the Crown
from his Head. Their Opinions take aim to deſtroy the very Being of the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
for take away his Perfections and Attributes of abſolute Power and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and God is an imaginary Nothing: Who can conceive of him but as an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
Soveraign? and yet their Doctrine allows leſs Power to him in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal
of his Creatures, than a petty Negro Prince hath over his Subjects within
the Compaſs of his narrow Dominions. Who can think of God but as All-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and having at one view a certain Proſpect of all Perſons and Things, paſt,
preſent, and to come? and yet their Doctrine makes him to gueſs at the Future,
as an Aſtrologer by the Stars.</p>
            <p>Ay but it will be ſaid, What is all this to the Purpoſe of the preſent Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy,
wherein we have not to do with Arminians? 'Tis true we have not, but it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
every Miniſter of the Goſpel, to put a ſtop to any Opinion which hath the leaſt
tendency to Arminianiſm. We are not as idle Spectators, to ſtand by with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to ſee the Truths of the Goſpel, either openly invaded, or ſecretly ſupplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
but as long as we are able to frame a Thought, or hold a Pen, it is our Duty
to make a vigorous Oppoſition. We have the Example of thoſe worthy Divines in
<hi>France,</hi> the old <hi>Du Moulin,</hi> and others, to animate and encourage us. When
<hi>Teſtard</hi> and <hi>Amyrault</hi> advanc'd ſome new Opinions to meet Arminianiſm in the
middle Courſe, which were ſoon, by an unhappy Wind, wafted over into <hi>England;</hi>
theſe worthy Perſons (who were as firmly reſolv'd that the old Goſpel ſhould not
be alter'd, as we Engliſh are zealous that our old Fundamental Laws be not
chang'd) preſently took the Alarm, and reſiſted the Invaſion. Complaints were
made in their Synod againſt <hi>Teſtard</hi> and <hi>Amyrault,</hi> as Corrupters of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant

            <argument>
               <p>The general Deſign of this Diſcourſe, is not to promote Controverſies,
or to propagate Quarrels, but to maintain the Truths of the
Goſpel in their firſt native Purity. The State of the Queſtion
concerning the Goſpel's being a Law.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>I Am ſo far from inventing, or defending any new dividing Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
to trouble the Peace of the Churches, that I heartily lament
the fatal Diſturbances which are produced by them; and inſtead
of fomenting the prevailing Heat of our Contentions, or blowing
a Fire which is but too great, I would willingly contribute all my poor
Endeavours to quench the Flames. It is not therefore out of an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
of Diſputing that I engage in this Debate, nor to promote the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
of a Party: I know no Intereſt, and by the Grace of God will
never eſpouſe any, but that of Chriſt and his Goſpel. It is an apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the Injury offered to this, which is the Motive of my undertaking
its Defence. It is the Intereſt of wronged Truth that I aſſert, which all
who love, have indiſpenſable Obligations to vindicate. It is the pure
Goſpel, by ſo many various Attaques aſſaulted, that I ſtand to guard;
and which being Eternal, tho it may be invaded, yet can never be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd
nor ſink for want of Support, tho my Strength prove unequal
to ſo great a Performance. It is that Goſpel which was taught by our
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49801:4"/>
Lord Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, which was own'd in the firſt and beſt
Ages of the Primitive Church, and is now profeſſed in all the Confeſſions
of Faith of the Reformed; which not all the Arts, and Power, neither
of <hi>Rome</hi> Heathen, nor which is worſe, Antichriſtian, were able to extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate;
which not two Ages ago was recovered out of the Darkneſs of
Antichriſt by the firſt Reformers, and vigorouſly aſſerted by them,
againſt all the Subtleties and cunning Evaſions, both of Papiſts and
others, to ſhift off the Force of Truth; and is from thoſe our worthy
Anceſtors of the Proteſtant Religion deliver'd down to us; which
was ſeal'd by the Blood of Martyrs, which was maintained againſt all
the Powers of the Earth arm'd for its Ruin; and is, and will be (I
doubt not) by a greater Power preſerved to ſurvive the Aſhes of the
World, though it is in more danger of being betray'd by its pretended
Friends, than ever it was of being conquered by an open War of its
declared Enemies.<note n="a" place="bottom">Credita Res, capti<expan>

doubt) it will in the End, yet by the firſt ſtarting theſe diſputable Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
a hopeful Union among Proteſtants is broken, and thoſe troublers
of <hi>Iſrael</hi> have ſhattered us to pieces, and may bring us within a Point of
our Ruin; and ſo what they unſucceſsfully attempted by Power and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution,
they will effect (if God doth not avert) by our own ſad Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
            <p>It is this oppos'd Goſpel which I love and value above all things, and
by the help of my Lord Jeſus Chriſt, I will defend its pure Truths en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
and unmangled. And as it is this Goſpel which teaches me not to
treat any of its Miniſters with inſolent Contempt, however I may differ
from him, in my Sentiments, ſo I will endeavour to obſerve its Dictates, in
avoiding all baſe and ſcurrilous Reflections (being but the Follies of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49801:4"/>
Paſſion) when I write for thoſe Truths which are calm, peaceful,
and gentle, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3. 17. And indeed ever ſince the Light of common Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
began to dawn upon my Mind, as well as ſince God gave me a
greater, I always abhorr'd that Method of managing Controverſies in
Religion, wherein Arguments are mingled with Invectives, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiences
of Reaſon made up with Calumnies and Reproaches. Tho the
double injury done both to Truth, and my Friend, the one of which is
equally inſulted with an haughty fierceneſs, as the other is openly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted,
might tempt a Man of the greateſt Moderation to ſome paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Reſentments; yet nothing ſhall move me from my fixed Reſolution
of not being angry. I write not from an Humour of Strife, nor for
Pride and vain Glory, but for Truth, and therefore ſhall concern my
ſelf no further than I find that to be intereſted; which if I thought to
be on my Learned Brother's Side, I ſhould be ſo far from conteſting it
with him, that I would join in the Defence. This Truth lies between
us, and ſhould not be loſt in a crowd of angry Words; tho this is the
Fault of moſt Diſputes in Religion, and is a Reproach to what we all
profeſs, that when Philoſophers and Heathens diſcours'd their different
Opinions with a Calmneſs of Mind, we Chriſtians, for whom our Great
Lord died, that God might be reconciled to us, and we to one another,
are inflamed with all Paſſions, becauſe we do not think and ſpeak the
ſame Things. We every one of us diſpute, becauſe we think we are
in the right, when we ſo order the loud Diſputation, that Truth which
ſpeaks ſoftly cannot be heard, its ſtill Voice being drowned in the Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
of our Contentions. Now then that nothing may diſturb a Sere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of Mind, which ought to be in a Perſon who argues not for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
but purely for the Truth, I ſhall only conſider in my Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
Brother's Diſcourſe, what carries the Face and Appearance of
Reaſon, without ſuffering my Thoughts to be diverted or rufled by his
Invectives. In a Word, I will not change a Defenſive War for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Intereſts of our Chriſtian Religion, into a private Quarrel, ſince it
is not any Man's Perſon, but the Truth which I have undertaken to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate.
And indeed the Reputation for Piety and Learning of thoſe
whom he inſults, is ſo glorious, that any Attempt to defend them is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
needleſs. As for <hi>Bradwardine</hi> and Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> on whom he is
pleas'd to beſtow ſome diſadvantageous Remarks, they are ſo great Names,
and have deſervedly obtain'd ſuch an high Eſteem among Men, that they
are equally above his little Reflections, as beyond any Endeavours I can
imploy for their Vindication. They are both known Champions againſt
two the moſt malignant Hereſies which ever infected the Church, Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gianiſm,
(to which that of the Arminians is very nearly related) and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49801:5"/>
Socinianiſm. And as for Mr. <hi>Marſhal,</hi> that very Book which our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
ſo much vilifies, diſcovers a pious Heart, joined with a cloſeneſs and
conſiſtency of Thought. And all who know that other worthy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
againſt whom his Paſſion is more furiouſly fired, muſt give his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
very different from that, by which, with an unſucceſsful attempt
of Wit, he endeavours to repreſent him. But as in Debates of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
all little Efforts of Wit (if I had any) would be very unſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and impertinent; I ſhall only ſeriouſly argue the Cauſe in queſtion
by Scripture and Reaſon, ſince alſo I do not think that People are oblig'd
to miſpend their Time to read long Diſcourſes, to entertain themſelves
unprofitably with thoſe perſonal Reflections, with which ſuch are uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſtuff'd, more than with Arguments; ſince it doth not concern them to
know, whether ſuch or ſuch a Man be ſo wiſe and ſo rational as he is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
to be, or ſilly and ridiculous, but only what is Truth, and the
Danger of <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

               </gap> accordingly ſtudy brevity and plainneſs as much as ever I
can; and ſhall reduce my following Diſcourſe to as narrow a Compaſs as
poſſible, and ſo conſider in that of the Learned Mr. <hi>Lorimer</hi> no more than
what ſeems moſt to the Purpoſe. I will not at all affect Niceties, or
ſubtile Evaſions; and indeed any Opinion which needs them, and I know
not how many perplexing Diſtinctions to maintain it, may very well be
ſuſpected: for Truth never ſeeks Corners to hide in, nor can endure to
be ſet in a falſe Light, but loves to appear in its pure native Brightneſs.
And it is our Duty, who by Office and Commiſſion, as Miniſters of
Chriſt, are to teach the Goſpel to the People, that we do not ſcatter Miſts
about them, as if throwing Duſt in their Eyes was the way to clear their
Sight; that we do not amuſe them with new Terms fetch'd from the
Civil Law, and make it neceſſary for them to ſtudy <hi>Juſtinian, Bartolus,</hi>
and <hi>Cujacius;</hi> to read the <hi>Pandects</hi> and the <hi>Codes,</hi> that they may know
how they are juſtified. This, inſtead of inſtructing, would be to confound
thoſe whom we are to lead into the Truth, by the cleareſt Expreſſions
of God's Holy Word, and to inform them in the plaineſt manner that
we can.</p>
            <p>What I have propoſed to my ſelf to debate in the preſent Diſcourſe,
is, <hi>Whether the Goſpel be a new Law?</hi> Without multiplying words, which
doth but obſcure the clearneſs of Things, the Queſtion in diſpute is
not, Whether the Goſpel be a new Law, if by <hi>that Word</hi> is meant a
Doctrine of Grace newly reveal'd, after the Covenant of Works was
broken, wherein God hath declared in what Order and Manner he will
ſave guilty condemned Sinners. If by a new Law no more is meant
than this, it is preſently granted, and the Controverſy is at an end. What
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49801:5"/>
is denied is this, That the Goſpel is a Law commanding new Precepts,
as Conditions of obtaining its Bleſſings, and eſtabliſhed with a Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
promiſing Life and Happineſs to the obſervance of them, and
threatning the Neglect.</p>
            <p>Tho according to the Laws of a Diſcourſe, I ſhould firſt urge Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to prove, that the Goſpel is not ſuch a Law; yet my firſt Deſign
being to anſwer the Reverend Mr. <hi>Lorimer</hi>'s Apology, I ſhall firſt ſhew
how little to his Purpoſe he eagerly catches at the word <hi>Law,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he can meet with it in the Scriptures, or in the Writings of Men.</p>
            <p>And firſt I ſhall demonſtrate, that where-ever the Goſpel is nam'd a
Law, either in the Old or New Teſtament, only a Doctrine of Grace
is to be underſtood by it.</p>

            <p>THE word <hi>Law</hi> is of ſuch various Signification, that it is not at

And yet it is by a Law, tho not any Precept, that it moves ſo orderly;
and a Law it is, without any promiſe of Recompence for obſerving and
keeping duly the mark'd-out Courſe, or threatning a Penalty for devia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

Air, Earth, and Water, and the Heavenly Bodies, are well enough
ſaid to act by a Law, tho they have no Rule of Duty given them,

other Method, than that ſet by God of applying Chriſt's Blood, and

which is enough to evince, that in its original and native Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
it ſignifies no more than a Doctrine which is taught us: and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
it, I ſhall produce ſeveral places of Scripture where it is us'd in
this Senſe.</p>
            <p>By this word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Torah,</hi> ſometimes is expreſſed any Doctrine or
Inſtruction, which Parents give to their Children, or a Man to his Friend.
Thus in <hi>Prov. 3. 1. Prov. 4. 2. Prov. 7. 3. Prov.</hi> 13. 14.</p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:49801:7"/>
            <p>In other places it is imploy'd to ſignify the whole Doctrine of Truth
contained in God's Word, both of the Old and New Teſtament. Thus
in <hi>Pſal. 1. 2. But his delight is in the Law of the Lord, and in his Law doth
he meditate Day and Night.</hi> The Deſign of the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> being to give the
entire Character of a Perſon truly bleſſed, the Deſcription muſt be ſo
comprehenſive, as to take in, not only his delighting in the Precepts of
the Moral Law, (which a Turk or Heathen may do, and the old Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers
really did) but an inward feeling of a raviſhing Pleaſure in the
Knowledg of the Goſpel, and in meditating on the admirable free
Grace of God diſplay'd in the Salvation of a Sinner. And it is this
pleaſing Senſe, reſulting from the Apprehenſion of the Doctrine of
Grace, which is the diſtinguiſhing Mark of that bleſſed Believer, whom
the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> with ſuch wonderful Eloquence deſcribes. So then the Law
in which the Believer delights, is not the old Law of Works, nor a new
one of a reſembling Nature, but it is the Doctrine of the Goſpel, as
opening the hidden and unſearchable Riches of God's Grace and Love
in Chriſt Jeſus. And thus the moſt Learn'd<note n="a" place="bottom">Cajetan, Lorinus in Pſal. 1. 2. Muſculus, Piſcator, Geierus in Pſal. 1. 2.</note> Commentators, both
Papiſts, as well as thoſe of the Reformed Religion, explain the word
<hi>Law</hi> in this extenſive Meaning, as not meerly ſignifying Precepts, and
Commands, but that delightful Inſtruction which the Knowledg of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical
Truths affords the happy Believer.</p>
            <p>More expreſly the Doctrine of Grace in the Goſpel is called <hi>a Law,</hi>
Pſal. 19. 7. <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect, converting the Soul: the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the Lord is ſure, making wiſe the Simple.</hi> That it is not a Law of
Works, but the Word of Grace, is evident from Scripture, which is the
beſt interpreter of it ſelf. For the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> who beſt knew the
<hi>Pſalmiſt's</hi> meaning, applies the <hi>4th</hi> Verſe of this <hi>Pſalm</hi> 19. to illuſtrate
the ſwift ſpreading of the Doctrine of the Goſpel, and the Teaching
and Inſtruction of it coming to all Nations; <hi>Rom. 10. 17, 18. So then,
Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God. But I ſay, Have
they not heard? Yes verily, their Sound went into all the Earth, and their
Words unto the Ends of the World.</hi> That as the Sun, and Moon, and
Stars, in a Day and Night's Journey look round all the Earth, and tell
to all the Nations the Power and Wiſdom of the Creator, tho they ſay
not a Word of his Mercy and Grace: So the Preaching of the Goſpel
ſhall give a Sound through the whole World, not meerly to proclaim
the Great Majeſty and Goodneſs of God who made it, but his Infinite
Grace undiſcernable by Reaſon; and the Love of our Saviour, which is
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49801:7"/>
above all our Thoughts. Now then, as the plain Intention of the <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt</hi>
is by a Compariſon to ſhew, that as the Heavens manifeſt God's
Adorable Perfections, ſo his Law, <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. hath a more excellent Sound
and Inſtruction, in the Diſcoveries which it makes of his Grace: the
Apoſtle's taking one part of this Compariſon, and applying it to the
Word, or Doctrine of the Goſpel, neceſſarily infers, that he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> to intend by his Law no other, than this Doctrine of
Grace, which as the Sun, and all the other Lights of Heaven, ſpreads ſo
ſwiftly and univerſally. If we conſider too the <hi>Pſalmiſt's</hi> Senſe as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
by himſelf, we ſhall find that the Effects which he aſcribes to his
Law, cannot be produced but by a pure Doctrine of Grace.</p>
            <p>From theſe Effects, <hi>of converting the Soul, and making wiſe the
Simple,</hi> it is evident, that it cannot be underſtood a Law of Works
in any Senſe, for that inſtead of converting the Sinner, would but
frighten him from God; and ſo far is it from driving the guilty Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
to Chriſt, that without the Goſpel proclaim'd, the natural Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
of it is to hurry him into Deſpair. It could not let into the Soul
the leaſt Glimmerings of Hope; for ſuch a Law propoſeth Salvation upon
the Condition of Obedience to it, and yet at the ſame time convinceth
the poor wretched Sinner of his own utter Diſability to perform it. It
is then the pure Doctrine of Grace, encouraging the Soul to truſt and
hope in Chriſt, by directing him to that perfect Saviour for Pardon, and
Righteouſneſs, and Life; which is in the propereſt Senſe the converting
Law: And this Virtue and Efficacy our Lord Chriſt appropriates to his
Goſpel, <hi>John 17. 17. Sanctify them through thy Truth; thy Word is Truth.</hi>
By <hi>Truth</hi> there is more emphatically meant the Doctrine of Free Grace,
which Chriſt was ſent into the World to teach unto Men; and this, and
this only, is the effectual Means which God uſeth to turn Sinners to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and really to ſanctify them.</p>
            <p>And in other places where <hi>David</hi> (the Man after God's own Heart,
becauſe of that Evangelical Spirit which was in him) ſpeaks of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
which he took in God's Law, and the inconceivable Pleaſure
which ſprung up in his Soul, when his Thoughts were employ'd in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating
on it, by the word <hi>Law</hi> he underſtands the Goſpel, and that
not as a new Law of Works, but a Doctrine of Grace: For as ſuch it
reveals thoſe aſtoniſhing Myſteries concerning the Redeemer, and makes
thoſe ſurpriſing Diſcoveries of Grace, which only are capable of giving
that pleaſing entertainment of Mind, which the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſo much mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
as having enjoy'd it in his own. Thus in <hi>Pſal. 119. 97, 98. O how
love I thy Law! it is my Meditation all the Day. Thou, through thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,
haſt made me wiſer than mine Enemies; for they are ever with me.</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:49801:8"/>
Where it is evident, that he ſpeaks of a Doctrine, by the Knowledg of
which he had arrived to a higher Degree of the moſt excellent Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
than any who lived in the ſame Age and Nation with him, a Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
which he purſued with the moſt eager and inquiſitive Search; and
the diſcovery of one Myſtery did but animate him to an impatient en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
after more, and make him earneſt in his Petitions, that God
would reveal to him higher Meaſures of that admirable and moſt uſeful
Knowledg, <hi>Pſal. 119. 18. Open thou mine Eyes, that I may behold wondrous
Things out of thy Law.</hi> By which eſpecially is meant (as Mr.<note n="a" place="bottom">In his Annot. on <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 18.</note>) <hi>Clark</hi>
very well remarks) the Myſteries of the Goſpel. Here then we have
the Goſpel called a <hi>Law,</hi> not as a Syſtem of Precepts, or a Statute-Book of
a new Edition; but as it at once inſtructs and amazes us in the Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of our Redemption, and affects our Hearts with the thoughts of the
Redeemer's Love.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> alſo expreſſes thoſe refreſhing Comforts, which
ſlow'd into his Soul from the inexhauſtible Spring of God's tender Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
he uſeth the ſame word <hi>Law;</hi> and conſequently means by it, not a
Doctrine of Works, which can in no ſenſe give any Solace to a guilty
Mind, but a Doctrine of Grace, ſuch as the Goſpel, which diſplay'd
thoſe Riches of Grace to the <hi>Pſalmiſt's</hi> Sight, and in which he ſo chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
hop'd, and rejoic'd, <hi>Pſal. 119. 77. Let thy tender Mercies come unto
me, that I may live; for thy Law is my Delight; i. e.</hi> Let me experience
thy tender Mercies, let me feel my own Part and Intereſt in them, that
I may live joyfully: for my moſt fervent Deſire, O Lord, is to ſearch
into the Depths of thy Mercy and Love; and therefore my whole De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
is in that Word of Truth which contains theſe ineſtimable Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of thy Mercy, and expoſeth them all open to the view of my Faith.
Thus again the Goſpel is called a <hi>Law,</hi> but no otherwiſe than as it is a
comfortable Inſtruction to poor convinc'd Sinners, what Riches of Mercy
there are in ſtore, and as it teacheth them how they may truſt and hope
in the God of all Grace.</p>
            <p>In another place we read the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> informing us what ſupported
his Spirit under inward Troubles and outward Afflictions which oppreſs'd
him; And what was it but the Law of God? not the Precepts or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
for how could they have ſuſtain'd his ſinking Spirit, ſince they
only tell us our Duty, but offer us no help in the ſad Circumſtances of
our Caſe? They ſhew us indeed what God would have us to do, but
declare nothing what he will do for us, and ſo diſcover not any ſupport
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49801:8"/>
to our languid Spirits fainting under a Calamity. This is the Nature,
and the proper and peculiar Office of the Promiſes, and the Goſpel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently,
as a Body of them, is called by the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> a <hi>Law,</hi> in which he
delighted, becauſe it thus ſuſtained him under his Afflictions, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.
92. <hi>Vnleſs thy Law had been my Delights, I ſhould then have periſhed in
mine Affliction.</hi> A Law, that is (as the before-mentioned<note n="a" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Clark</hi>'s Annotat. on <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 92.</note> judicious
Annotator obſerves) the whole Word of God, chiefly the Promiſes of
Support and Deliverance.</p>
            <p>If we conſider thoſe Places which are more expreſly urg'd to prove
the Goſpel to be a new Law, it will appear that they only evince it to be
a new Doctrine of Grace. As,</p>
            <p>1. That clear Place in the Prophet <hi>Eſa,</hi> where by Law is expreſſed
ſolely the Doctrine of Grace in the Goſpel, <hi>Iſa. 2. 3. And many Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
ſhall go and ſay, Come ye, and let us go up to the Mountain of the Lord,
to the Houſe of the God of</hi> Jacob, <hi>and he will teach us of his Ways, and we
will walk in his Paths: for out of</hi> Zion <hi>ſhall go forth the Law, and the
Word of the Lord from</hi> Jeruſalem. It is manifeſtly the Deſign of the
Prophet, in the firſt and ſecond Verſes, to ſhew how large a Church,
not ſtraiten'd within the narrow Confines of <hi>Judea,</hi> but ſpreading
through all Nations of the Univerſe, ſhould be gathered and eſtabliſhed.
Then he tells us by what Way and Means ſuch a great and wonderful
Work ſhould be accompliſhed. Chriſt doth not raiſe Armies to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
the Earth to himſelf, nor come to give new Laws to the conquered
People, but he ſends his Apoſtles to preach the glad Tidings of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by him: And the Light of this glorious Doctrine of Grace breaks
forth from <hi>Zion</hi> with ſuch Swiftneſs and Violence, as ſuddenly to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
all Parts of the Earth, and with a raviſhing Sweetneſs irreſiſtibly
to draw every Mind and Heart, whom God hath appointed to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to aſſent to it and embrace it, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. It is the Doctrine of Grace
alone, and not any new Precepts or Commands, or any new Sanction of a
Law, which carries in it ſo admirable Force able to produce theſe aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing
Effects. This is the Law which goes forth out of <hi>Zion</hi> ſo ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully:
It is the Doctrine of Grace which is thus victorious, and invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly
prevails, when the Doctrine of Works, in the Experience of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Ages, could not ſubject one ſtubborn Sinner to God's Kingdom, nor
make one ſtiff and hardened Heart to bow to his Scepter of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
And that by the Law out of <hi>Zion,</hi> he means this effectual Doctrine
of the Goſpel, the next words, [And the Word of the Lord from
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49801:9"/>
               <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>] as explanatory of the former, undeniably prove<note n="a" place="bottom">

            <p>If we look next on that place of Scripture in <hi>Micah</hi> 4. 2. which is not
meerly parallel to the forecited in <hi>Eſa,</hi> but perfectly agreeing with it,
we ſhall ſee it imports Chriſt, not as a new Legiſlator, to have given a
new Law of Works on more moderate Terms, but to have taught a
pure Doctrine of Grace. The words of <hi>Micah</hi> 4. 2. are theſe, <hi>And
many Nations ſhall come, and ſay, Come, and let us go up to the Mountain
of the Lord, and to the Houſe of the God of</hi> Jacob, <hi>and he will teach us of
his Ways, and we will walk in his Paths: for the Law ſhall go forth of</hi> Zion,
<hi>and the Word of the Lord from</hi> Jeruſalem. The Hebrew <gap reason="foreign">

And <hi>Piſcator</hi> in his ſhort Notes on the Text, critically obſerves, that
however the word <hi>Torah</hi> is rendred by others Law, yet it will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord

Goſpel. And in his brief Expoſition on the next Words, [<hi>And the

in <hi>Hiphil</hi> ſignifies, <hi>he hath taught:</hi> that it is frivolous to deſign from
this Text to prove the Goſpel to be a new and more perfect Law
made by Chriſt in the New Teſtament, whenas tho indeed by this He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braiſm
the Goſpel is call'd a <hi>Law</hi> by the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 2. as alſo by
the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 8. yet with a Reſtriction; but the Law is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
called a Goſpel.</q> And the latter Words [<hi>the Word of the Lord</hi>]
he makes conſonantly with <hi>Calvin,</hi> to be exegetical of the former Law,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> as demonſtrating, that nothing but the Doctrine of the Goſpel
is thereby ſignified. But really there need no more than carefully
to review the Context, to be ſatisfied, that by the word <hi>Law</hi> here is
meant the Doctrine of Grace in the Goſpel: For all this <hi>4th</hi> Chapter of
<hi>Micah</hi> is a Word of Conſolation to an afflicted People, from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing
Springs of its gracious Promiſes, as<note n="e" place="bottom">Annotat. in Mic. 4. 1, 2.</note> 
               <hi>Junius</hi> notes. The Law
then by conſequence muſt ſignify the Doctrine wherein thoſe are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained:
And the Acclamations too of the rejoicing People proclaim the
ſame thing, who mutually exhort one another in the ſecond Verſe, to go
up to this glorious Mountain, becauſe there Chriſt would teach them this
Doctrine of Grace, <hi>Micah 4. 2. And many Nations ſhall come, and ſay,
Come, and let us go up to the Mountain of the Lord, and to the Houſe of the
God of</hi> Jacob, <hi>and he will teach us of his Ways, and we will walk in his Paths:
for the Law ſhall go forth of</hi> Zion, <hi>and the Word of the Lord from</hi> Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.
I know it may be objected, that the Phraſe [<hi>And we will walk in
his Paths</hi>] ſeems to imply a Precept and Command, and ſo a Law in the
ſtricteſt Senſe, to which they vowed Obedience: But this may as eaſily
be denied, as 'tis aſſerted precariouſly: for ſince, according to the uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Language of God's Word, to walk in God's Paths, is to obſerve his
Orders and Appointments, the Expreſſion here may denote no more
than that they would punctually keep to the Way of Salvation, mark'd
out by him, (which I wiſh, with all my Soul, was the hearty Reſolve of
all who hear the Goſpel) and ſeek to be juſtify'd no otherwiſe than by
Chriſt's Blood and Righteouſneſs, as the Law or Doctrine of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
preſcribes.</p>
            <p>There is a Difficulty remains, ariſing from the third Verſe; which at
firſt ſight ſeems to point to us, that the Goſpel is ſuch a Law, by which
Chriſt exerciſeth Judgment as on a Tribunal, and executes Juſtice. But
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49801:10"/>
the Appearance of Difficulty is ſo ſlight and thin, that it will vaniſh as
ſoon as ſeen, if we do but conſider that the word <hi>Judg</hi> may very well
import no more, than that Chriſt will judg what Courſe of Salvation is
beſt for us to take, that he will determine the Caſe; and it is better for
us to acquieſce in the Deciſion of his unerring Judgment, which cannot
be deceiv'd, nor ever will miſlead us, than to purſue our own miſtaken
Apprehenſions, which bewilder us continually.</p>
            <p>But if we take his Judging, as having an Influence or Effect upon
thoſe who are under his Kingdom and Judgment; it may be conſidered,
not as the Act of a Judg pronouncing Sentence, and Condemning, but
as the<note n="a" place="bottom">Nam verbum Judicandi Hebraeis per Synecdochen, pro gubernare, vel regere acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitur. <hi>Calvin.</hi> Comment. in Eſa. 3. 2, 4. Pag. 22. Tom. 4. oper. <hi>Genev.</hi> 1617.</note> Adminiſtration of a Wiſe, Good, and Gracious King pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
and protecting his Subjects, and defending them againſt their
Enemies. That the word <hi>Judging</hi> is taken in ſuch a large Senſe in the
Hebrew Language, there needs no more to prove it, than that the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whom God rais'd up, and ſpirited to be the Liberators of
his People from the Tyranny of <hi>Moab, Ammon,</hi> and <hi>Midian,</hi> and to
defend them againſt thoſe cruel and implacable Enemies, are not only
call'd <hi>Judges,</hi> but the Book which contains the Hiſtory of their Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
and Government, is titled by that Name. Or if we attribute to
Chriſt the rigorous Adminiſtration of a ſevere Judg, and that he comes
in all the terrible Solemnities of Juſtice; yet this doth not belong to
the Diſpenſation of his Goſpel, but to the Oeconomy of his Laws,
when he comes to avenge the Violation of them by Sinners. To thoſe
who live and die under a Covenant of Works, he is a Judg to be ſure,
and a dreadful One too; and they who ſeek Righteouſneſs by the Works
of any Law, he will deal with in that way of Trial, which they have
put themſelves upon, and they ſhall ſtand at the Bar of Judgment, which
by their own Conſent they have ſo fooliſhly choſen. Thus Chriſt will be
all Juſtice, without any mixture of Mercy, to the Deſpiſers of his Grace,
and to thoſe who refuſe him as a Saviour, and as the Lord their Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
But this is no meaſure belongs to the Adminiſtration of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,
as any part of it, nor appertains to the Office of a Redeemer,
but is the proper Royalty and Authority of a Creator, of him who is
the Soveraign, the ſupream Lord, and God the Judg of all. If we
conſider the Scope and Deſign of the Text, it will ſeem very much to
look toward ſuch a Meaning, that Chriſt will not judg thoſe to whom
he hath made ſuch a promulgation of his Law, or Doctrine of his Grace,
which he had ſpoke of <hi>ver.</hi> 2. if by Faith they had received it, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerably
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49801:10"/>
embraced the Redeemer. But for their ſakes he would exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
Juſtice on the Nations, who are their Enemies, and who know him
not, or hate him. That he will break their Force and Power, or turn
the Points of thoſe Swords upon their own Breaſts, which were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
employed againſt his People; ſo that now theſe ſhall not need Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
or Fleets to defend them, but may change their Weapons of War
into Inſtruments of Husbandary, or the Utenſils of a Family, and other
Implements of Peace. Thus Chriſt for his Church's Safety, governs in
the midſt of his Enemies, <hi>Pſal. 110. 1, 2, 5, 6. The Lord ſaid unto my
Lord, Sit thou at my right Hand, until I make thine Enemies thy Footſtool.
The Lord ſhall ſend the Rod of thy Strength out of</hi> Zion: <hi>Rule thou in
the midſt of thine Enemies. The Lord at thy right Hand ſhall ſtrike through
Kings in the Day of his Wrath. He ſhall judg among the Heathen, he ſhall
fill the Places with the dead Bodies: he ſhall wound the Heads over many Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</hi>
And he ſo rules, that when they have an hearty Will, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd
Malice, yet it ſhall not be in their Power to deſtroy in all his Holy
Mountain, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65. 25.</p>
            <p>Or what if we underſtand it, that Chriſt will ſo judg among the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as in his Providence to manage Affairs, and order in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
the Spirits of the Troublers of his Churches, as to diſpoſe them
unto peaceful Counſel, which may move them univerſally to lay down
their Arms, that his People may enjoy an undiſturbed Repoſe in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Tranquillity of the World? At Chriſt's firſt appearance among
Men, thus calm and ſmooth was the Face of Things throughout the
whole Earth, and the Prince of Peace was born in ſuch a Time, as
there were not the leaſt Tumults to diſquiet the Beginnings of his Reign.
A little before Chriſt's Birth, all the World was up in Arms, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
was heard but the ſhrill ſound of Trumpets, and the Alarms of
War: But the Prince of Peace no ſooner makes his Entrance, than the
Scene is quite altered, and an univerſal Calm ſucceeded the foregoing
Diſorders and Confuſion. Thus Chriſt began to judg among the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
at his firſt appearance on Earth, by ſettling their Affairs in a quiet
and peaceful Poſture; and the Time will ſurely come, when the Effects
of this his judging will be more openly illuſtrious. Thus in whatever
Senſe we underſtand Chriſt to judg among the Nations, his being a new
Legiſlator, and his governing them by new Laws, is entirely excluded.</p>

            <p>AS I have prov'd, that when the Goſpel is named a Law in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,
according to the ſignification of the Hebrew word, a Doctrine
only may be underſtood; ſo if we conſider how the Greek word is us'd by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
who have wrote in that Language, it will appear, that it is with no
certainty concluded by my Reverend Brother, from the Goſpel's being call'd a
<hi>Law</hi> in the New Teſtament, that it is a Rule of Works eſtabliſh'd with Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
to the Performers, and with Threatnings againſt the Diſobedient.</p>
            <p>I know very well that it is inferr'd from the Etymology of the Greek
word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Nomos,</hi> a Law, that a Rule of Duty, enacted with a Sanction
of Penalty or Recompence, is ſignified by it. But I know, that as no great

Goſpel, when deſcrib'd by that Name, is a Rule of Works with a Sanction
ſince the Word admits of ſo many other Sgnifications.</p>
            <p>I may however urge it as very natural to my Purpoſe, of proving the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
to be a pure Doctrine of Grace; that the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> when they tranſlate
thoſe places of Scripture, wherein I have prov'd that the Hebrew <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Nomos,</hi> as moſt fitting
to expreſs ſuch a Senſe. We may then very well conclude, that the Greek
word (when the Goſpel is named by it) hath the ſame Senſe in the New
Teſtament, as the Hebrew had in the Old.</p>
            <p>We anſwerably find that the Doctrine of Salvation by Chriſt, as revealed in
the Old Teſtament, is expreſſed by this Name, <hi>John 12. 34. The People an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
him, We have heard out of the Law, that Chriſt abideth for ever:
and how ſaiſt thou, The Son of Man muſt be lift up? Who is this Son of
Man?</hi> Where not the Decalogue, or Levitical Book of Statutes is intended,
but the Doctrine concerning the Redeemer to come; as appears from thoſe
Texts in <hi>Pſal. 110. 4, 5. Iſa.</hi> 9. 6. to which <hi>John</hi> 12. 34. hath a manifeſt regard.
It is then plain from this Place of the Evangeliſt, that among the Jewiſh Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
when our Saviour lived on Earth, not only <hi>Exodus</hi> and <hi>Leviticus,</hi> but
the Inſtructions which they had concerning their ſo much deſir'd and expected
<hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and Salvation by him, in any of the Books of the Old Teſtament,
were call'd and known by the Name of a <hi>Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to this common Notion of the People, according to which they nam'd
the whole Doctrine reveal'd by God, whether it were Precepts or Promiſes,
a Law, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> accommodates his way of writing, in ſtiling the
Goſpel a <hi>Law,</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 27. (which I ſhall afterwards more fully vindicate
from my Reverend Brother's impoſed meaning) and in <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 19. which I
now ſhall conſider.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Apoſtle's Words, <hi>Gal. 2. 19. For I through the Law am dead
to the Law, that I might live unto God.</hi> He writes to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> among
whom it was a prevailing Opinion, that tho Chriſt had abated the too rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
obſervation of the Law of Works, yet Juſtification was to be obtain'd
by ſome lower degrees of Obedience. To ſhew them how oppoſite this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
was to the Goſpel preach'd by him, the Apoſtle tells them what were
the Experiences of his own Soul; <hi>I am dead,</hi> ſays he, <hi>to the Law of Works,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49801:12"/>
and have not the leaſt Heart to ſeek Juſtification by it.</hi> And how was he thus
mortified to the Law of Works? What, by a new Law of Works lower'd to
more moderate Conditions? No; for ſuch an one would rather have che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed
and encouraged the Life of his Hopes in his own Obedience. By the Law
then, that is, by the pure Doctrine of Grace in the Goſpel revealing Chriſt's
Righteouſneſs as that alone by which a Sinner can be juſtified, the Apoſtle is
quite deaden'd as to any hopes of Juſtification by his own Righteouſneſs, and
hath not the leaſt motion in his Soul to ſeek it in that manner.</p>
            <p>What very much weighs with me, is, That <hi>Luther</hi> (who ſo excellently hath
wrote on this Epiſtle, and who ſucceſsfully prevailed againſt the Errors of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt,
about Merit of Works, by ſubverting the great Foundation of them,
which is this Aſſertion of the Goſpel's being a milder Law of Works) inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets
the Apoſtle to mean by that Law, which had ſuch a mortifying Efficacy
upon him, the pure Doctrine of Grace in the Goſpel.<note n="a" place="bottom">Lex Decalogi ligabat me, contra illam nunc habeo aliam Legem ſcilicet gratiae quae non eſt mihi Lex, ne<expan>

Law againſt the damning LAW. THIS it binds, that it may no longer bind
me.</hi> If <hi>Luther</hi> thus calls the Goſpel a <hi>Law,</hi> ſignifying no more by that
Name than a pure Doctrine of Grace; it is no wonder that others of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Religion, cited by my Reverend Brother, call it ſo too, tho not in his
Senſe; but deſigning <hi>Luther</hi>'s Meaning, who ruin'd the greateſt Strength of
Popery, by denying the Goſpel to be a new Law of Works, and by aſſerting
it on all Occaſions to be meerly a Doctrine of Grace.</p>
            <p>But it is not the Authority of this Great Man which ſolely prevails with me;
the Deſign and Scope of the Apoſtle in this ſecond Chapter of his Epiſtle to
the <hi>Galatians,</hi> hath the greateſt Force to perſwade me, that by the Law which
made him dead to the Law of Works, he intends the ſincere and unmuddied
Doctrine of free Juſtification by Chriſt's Righteouſneſs alone. His Deſign is
plainly to refute an Error prevailing among the <hi>Galatians;</hi> who tho profeſſing
the Goſpel, and to be juſtified by Faith in Chriſt, yet would make this Goſpel
to be a new Law, exacting Works as neceſſary to Juſtification. He anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
diſclaims every Law of Works, whether the old Jewiſh, or that new
Evangelical One ſo lately invented among theſe Chriſtians, and made to look
with the poliſh'd and ſmooth Face of the Goſpel. He excludes the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
of any Duties, or any Act of Obedience, from having an Intereſt in our
Juſtification, aſſigning the whole Buſineſs of it to Faith alone; <hi>ver.</hi> 16.
<hi>Knowing that a Man is not juſtified by the Works of the Law, but by the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49801:12"/>
Faith of Jeſus Chriſt: even we have believed in Jeſus Chriſt, that we might
be juſtified by the Faith of Chriſt, and not by the Works of the Law; for by
the Works of the Law ſhall no Fleſh be juſtified.</hi> It is thus he demonſtrates
this Propoſition, [That we are not juſtified by the Works of any Law] That
they who were Jews, to whom the Law was more eſpecially given, yet they
having been inſtructed by the Doctrine of Grace, that they could not be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by Obedience to the Law; and having by the Goſpel, which brings in a
better Righteouſneſs, been convinc'd of the Defects of their own; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
knowing that God had not appointed any Law whereby he would juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
a Sinner, they anſwerably had believed on Chriſt, that ſo according to the
Doctrine of the Goſpel they might be juſtified by his Righteouſneſs alone.
This is undoubted that we muſt be juſtified by ſome Righteouſneſs or other;
not by our own, for then Juſtification would be by the Works of a Law; and
ſo our Faith in another's Righteouſneſs would be inſignificant, and to little or
no purpoſe: For why ſhould we entirely truſt in another Perſon, for that which
we could ſo well accompliſh our ſelves? If then not our own, it muſt be Chriſt's
Righteouſneſs only that can have this deſir'd Effect; and knowing <hi>this</hi> by the
Law or Doctrine of the Goſpel, we have (ſays the Apoſtle) for this very
purpoſe believ'd on Jeſus. This, without any Shuffles or intricate Windings,
is the plain Senſe of this <hi>16th</hi> Verſe. And among other Cauſes which morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in him, and the other Believers, any Inclinations to ſeek Juſtification by
the Law, <hi>Pareus</hi> numbers the Doctrine of the Goſpel, as that which had the
ſtrongeſt and moſt efficacious Influence<note n="a" place="bottom">Pareus in Gal. 2. 19. in part. 2. oper. exeget. Calvin. in Gal. 2. 19. Eilhardus Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binus in Gal. 2. 19. in Tom. 1. Exercit. Theol. in Epiſtolas. <hi>Francof.</hi> 1612.</note>. It is now then very agreeably,
that the Apoſtle ſays of himſelf, That this Law or Doctrine of Grace had made
him dead to the Law of Works, but alive unto God. What is it to be dead
to the Law? To renounce it in the Matter of our Juſtification, to be freed from
its galling Yoke of Servitude and Bondage, whereby it keeps guilty unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
Sinners perpetually under the Tortures of ſlaviſh Fears and amazing
Terrors. To be dead to the Law, is to diſclaim our Juſtification by Works of
our own, and not to truſt in any Obedience which we can perform to it;
and being convinced that it condemns and dooms us to Death, not to ſeek
Life by it any more, and no longer to have the leaſt Commerce with it in the
Affairs of our Juſtification: or to be dead to the Law, is no more to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
to its condemning Sentence, in that it cannot exact from thee its
threaten'd Puniſhments; tho indeed as a Rule of Duty it always unalterably
requires Obedience. To be dead to the Law, is no longer to be under its
Dominion and Reign, as it is a Covenant of Works. Thus a King hath no
Authority over a Subject, whom Death hath tranſported out of his Territories
into the Regions of another World; nor can the Power of the Greateſt reach
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49801:13"/>
beyond the Confines of the Grave. In all theſe Meanings the Apoſtle aſſerts
himſelf to be dead to the Law: And what was it made him ſo? What! but
the Law or Doctrine of Grace revealed in the Goſpel, which ſo happily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
him in the knowledg of free and compleat Juſtification by Chriſt.
This Sun no ſooner riſeth, but all thoſe little wandering Stars, which as falſe
Lights had before ſo wretchedly miſled him, do ſet preſently; and all his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
and rooted Inclinations, to ſeek Juſtification by the Works of the Law,
leſſen, and at laſt wholly vaniſh and diſappear at the glorious Appearance of
the Sun of Righteouſneſs, <hi>who comes with healing in his Wings.</hi> All thoſe
treacherous Hopes which he repos'd before in his Obedience to the Law, in
the ſevere Obſervance of its Precepts, and ſtrict Performances of Duties, are ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
extinguiſhed; and all the Sparks of them being quite dead, do not ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
any longer the leaſt Glimmerings in his Soul. Thus the Law, or Doctrine
of the Goſpel, teaching him, how that Chriſt his Surety being made under
the Law for him, hath redeem'd him from its Curſe, anſwered all its Demands,
and ſilenced every Accuſation, hath ſtopp'd its Mouth, and taken away its
Strength; and not only ſo, but depriv'd it of Life as well as Voice: the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle's
Mind being thus illuminated with the Light of his new Law, or Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Doctrine, to know more than ever he did before, that Chriſt hath ſlain
the Law as it is a Covenant of Works, as well as the Enmity which Sin had
cauſed between God and miſerable Sinners; he accordingly looks on the Law
as a dead Thing, which can neither hurt in reſpect to Condemnation, nor
do him any good as to Salvation and Life. He anſwerably regards it with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Eyes than before; and his former Zeal and Affection he had to it for
the Purpoſes of Juſtification, are not only abated, but extirpated out of his
Heart; not meerly cool'd and damp'd, but perfectly quench'd and dead.</p>
            <p>Now then that the Goſpel is called a <hi>Law</hi> by the Apoſtle, not in the ſtrict
Senſe, as importing Works of any kind, but as a meer Doctrine of Grace,
is evident from all theſe Effects which it produc'd. It perfectly mortified him
to a Law of Works, and therefore could not be one it ſelf, unleſs we can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
that the Apoſtle became dead, as to ſeeking Juſtification by the Works of
any Law whatever; and that no otherwiſe than by giving entertainment to,
and putting himſelf under the Conduct of a new Law of Works; which
things do not ſeem very well to agree.</p>
            <p>And that by Law, when the Goſpel is ſo nam'd in this <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 19. the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
means a pure Doctrine of Grace, and not a more moderated Law of
Works, appears from <hi>ver. 21. I do not fruſtrate the Grace of God: for if
Righteouſneſs come by the Law, then Chriſt is dead in vain.</hi> It is as if he
ſhould have ſaid, <q>However others deſpiſe the Grace of God, and think it too
mean and ignoble to owe their Life to it, it ſhall be my great Zeal to magnify
it, to illuſtrate its Glory, and to pay unto it the higheſt Honour. However
others are Obſtacles to its Progreſs, and endeavour to put a ſtop to its Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49801:13"/>
and Triumphs, or attempt to render all its Power and Force vain and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual,
yet for my part I will neither ſay nor do any thing to fruſtrate it;
and none of my Actions, nor any Article of Doctrine which I teach, ſhall in
the leaſt degree have ſuch a Tendency. I will not let fall a Word, which may
but ſeem to leſſen or diſparage the Favours of my bleſſed Redeemer, who lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
me, and gave himſelf for me. And can there be a greater Slight, than
when he hath done, and ſuffered ſo much to ſave me, not to reſt ſatisfied with
his Undertaking and Work as compleat, but to be ſolicitouſly endeavouring
how to ſupply the Deficiencies, and to perfect it my ſelf? To eſteem Chriſt as
inſufficient, is certainly to deſpiſe him in the higheſt meaſure, and he doth

Purpoſe of effecting what might have been done very well without ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of his ineſtimable Blood? For if by my Obedience to ſome Law I may
be juſtified, and the Works of that can be my Righteouſneſs, why ſhould
Chriſt die? or to what purpoſe was he obedient, ſince no other Ends of his
Death and Obedience are aſſigned, but the Juſtification of a Sinner? And if
this Buſineſs can be effected by this Sinner's own Works of what Nature ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,

ſo many Ages, very great Corruptions had wrought for themſelves an entrance
into the Grecian Churches; yet the Doctrine of Grace, not as eſtabliſhing a
Law of Works, but diſplacing it, was preſerv'd among them: Or at leaſt
we may know what his own Belief was from his own Words, which are
theſe. He firſt tells <hi>Sergius,</hi> (in an Epiſtle wrote to him) that<note n="f" place="bottom">

Law was not contrary to Grace, as he ſurmis'd it was; and then ſhews its

the diſcovery of Grace, and leads us to it. But <hi>when Grace comes, the Law</hi>
(ſays he) <hi>departs, as the Stars when the Sun appears, or as the Night the Day

he) <hi>Grace having an Exiſtence, the Law is vacated, tho not perfectly diſſolv'd.

Brother brings the Cauſe into a lower Court, I am very willing that it ſhould
there alſo be tried. The Proofs which I gave out of God's Word, have (as
I think) ſufficiently demonſtrated, that this new Law of Works is not the
Everlaſting Goſpel; and theſe Teſtimonies from Humane Writings may e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
that it is not only far diſtant from Eternity, but neither ſo venerable
for Age, as he fancies it: for it was a Doctrine unknown in the firſt Years of
Chriſt's Church, and had its Original only with the Birth of Antichriſt, and
(I am very well aſſur'd) will end with the Period of that Man of Sin.</p>

a Sanction.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only add, that <hi>Cicero</hi> when he defines a Law in the general Notion
of it, as comprehending the Law of Nature, as well as others, makes no
mention of a Sanction, but deſcribes it only to be the<note n="a" place="bottom">Lex eſt ratio ſumma infita in naturâ, quae jubet ea quae facienda ſunt, prohibet<expan>

            <p>Thus alſo the Roman Lawyers, of whoſe vaſt Volumes loſt by the Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries

than a Doctrine which teacheth us what is beſt for us to do, if we will be
taught by the Counſel of thoſe who are wiſer than our ſelves. And in this
Senſe I will eaſily grant the Goſpel to be a Law; for it is the Inſtruction of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49801:16"/>
God (whoſe Wiſdom is, beyond all denial, infinitely ſuperiour to ours) to
our periſhing Souls; and thrice bleſſed is that Perſon whom his enlightning
Grace hath made ſo wiſe as to follow it. It is too the Decree of God's Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Counſel, that we ſhall not be juſtified by any Righteouſneſs, but that of
Chriſt alone.</p>
            <p>Thus alſo the publiſh'd Will of the Soveraign may be call'd a <hi>Law,</hi> tho
the Sanction is wanting: And the Decrees of the Roman Senate might be
ſtil'd by that Name, before the Conſent of the People obtain'd, which was
neceſſary to enact them. Nay, a Statute is a Law, tho no Duty be preſcrib'd,
but only Benefits conferr'd, and ſome Privileges ratified. And when the
Emperors had the abſolute unlimited Power, thoſe Edicts which declared a
Donative,<note n="a" place="bottom">Codex Juſtinian. lib. 1. Tit. 2, &amp; 3. in Tom. 2. Jur. Civil. Edit. Gothofred.</note> or which gave and confirm'd any Privileges to the People, were
as well call'd <hi>Laws,</hi> as thoſe which were all Commands, and fill'd with
Threats againſt Diſobedience.</p>
            <p>Now theſe are the propereſt Judges to decide the Signification of a Word in
that Language, wherein they not only wrote, but it was their native Tongue,
which their Mothers taught them as ſoon as they were able to form a Voice.</p>
            <p>There then nothing more remains needful to remove my Learned Brother's
multiplied Citations out of the Latin Fathers, and Proteſtant Writers, which
he thinks to be very much to his Purpoſe, but to ſhew that they frequently
by the word <hi>Law</hi> mean no more than a Doctrine; and when I ſhall have, by

               <hi>Cyprian,</hi> whom he ſummons as a Witneſs for his Cauſe, (and the miſtaken

            <argument>
               <p>That the Divines of the Reformed Religion aſſert the Goſpel to be a pure Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Grace. When they call it a Law, they intend the Word in that
Senſe.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>I Will now prove, that when the Reformed Divines call the Goſpel a <hi>new
Law,</hi> they mean no more than a freſher and clearer Diſcovery of God's
Mercy and Grace. I ſhall produce Teſtimonies from their own Words of two
forts; firſt, To manifeſt that when they profeſſedly define, or deſcribe the
Goſpel, they bring nothing into their Definition, but that it is a Revelation
of our Salvation, and free Juſtification by Chriſt; and then I ſhall bring plain
Inſtances, that when they ſometimes call the Goſpel a <hi>new Law,</hi> they tell us
alſo at the ſame time, in expreſs words, they mean by it <hi>only a Doctrine of
Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, Then if nothing but Grace is expreſs'd in their Definitions of the
Goſpel, it is but reaſonable to require that it ſhould be granted me, that they
never thought the Goſpel to be a Law in the ſtrict Senſe, as including Works
in it, and being eſtabliſh'd with Sanction. For ſince it is one of the Rules
of a Definition, that it ſhould contain the whole Nature of the Thing; if it
be known to us, or can be comprized, we may be aſſur'd that theſe truly ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable
Perſons for Learning, as well as Piety, and the true Knowledg of
Chriſt, knew ſo well all the Arts of Reaſon, as they would not leave out of
their Definitions of the Goſpel, any of the Parts conſtituent of its Being.
But neither is the word Law, as the <hi>Genus,</hi> or the general Notion wherein
all that are ſo, agree, put into the Definition, nor any mention made of
Works. Thus thoſe who compil'd the <hi>Confeſſion of Faith,</hi> which was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd

wrought by the Holy Ghoſt in thoſe who hear the Goſpel; the Sum of this
Goſpel they give in theſe few words,<note n="a" place="bottom">In iis, qui audiunt Evangelium, ſcilicet quod Deus non propter noſtra merita, ſed propter Chriſtum, juſtificet hos qui credunt, ſe propter Chriſtum in gratiam recipi.

               <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Promiſes of God belong to the New Teſtament, yes, and are the
New Teſtament it ſelf.</hi> Which is in few words to expreſs his Senſe to be,
That the Nature of the Goſpel, and Covenant of Grace, ſtrictly and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
taken, conſiſts only in Promiſes. And the more deference is to be given to
what this Great Man ſays here, becauſe it was a Diſcourſe which he compos'd
on purpoſe to clear himſelf of thoſe vile Aſperſions which the clamorous
Monks perpetually bawl'd out to the People, That he was an Enemy to Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
diſparaged good Works, and by his preaching and writing the pure
Doctrines of Grace, encourag'd all manner of Licentiouſneſs and Villanies.
To vindicate himſelf, he compil'd, and ſent this Diſcourſe to Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the
Tenth, <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1520. before there was an open Rupture<note n="b" place="bottom">Sleidan. Hiſtor. lib. 2. pag. 25. Edit. in Fol. <hi>Francof.</hi> 1568.</note> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
tho his Adverſaries baſely reproached him as a Man of a boiſterous Spirit,
who, for want of a due Temper of Mind, was immoderately hurried, by a
fiery Zeal, to ſpeak and write he knew not what; yet we may be ſure, that
in this his little Treatiſe of <hi>Chriſtian Liberty,</hi> there are no Thoughts but
what are calm, and compos'd with mature deliberation: For he would not
write like an enraged Man againſt Popery before War was proclaim'd, nor
would ſuffer his Paſſion to tranſport him, or overcloud and diſtemper his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
when he pleaded his Cauſe before the Pope, who to be ſure had no very
favourable Opinion of him.</p>

               <hi>Philippus Melancthon,</hi> contemporary with <hi>Luther,</hi> and greatly aſſiſtant to
him in the Reformation of Religion, and whom God made a glorious Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to clear the Light of the Goſpel from the Darkneſs and Corruptions of
Antichriſt, doth as plainly deſcribe this Goſpel to be meer Doctrine of
Grace. Having firſt inferr'd, that the Name of the Goſpel is not a Word
framed at pleaſure, becauſe that the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> propounds a clear diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
between the Law and Goſpel, <hi>John 1. 17. For the Law was given by</hi>
Moſes, <hi>but Grace and Truth came by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               <note n="c" place="bottom">Neceſſe eſt enim diſcerni praecepta &amp; remiſſionem peccatorum, diſcerni praecepta &amp; promiſſiones.

               <hi>For it is neceſſary</hi>
(ſays he) <hi>that the Precepts and Pardon of Sin be diſcriminated, and that a
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49801:18"/>
Difference be put between Precepts and Promiſes, and alſo between the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
of meer Grace, and thoſe which are not ſo.</hi> And by theſe Lines he draws
the Deſcription of the oppoſite Natures of Law and Goſpel; that the firſt is
a Doctrine of Precepts, the other a Doctrine of Promiſes. Says he a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<hi>Our Adverſaries</hi> (ſpeaking of the Papiſts) <hi>tho they bawl out that they teach
the Goſpel, yet becauſe they do not inſtruct People concerning Reconcilation with
God freely of pure Grace, they leave Conſciences in doubt, and for the Goſpel
teach the Law.</hi> Now in all this there is not the leaſt hint of the Goſpel's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a new Law; nay, ſo far is he from the ſeeming appearance of ſuch an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion,
that he will not allow it, in its true and proper Nature, to contain Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
but Promiſes alone. In what Senſe it may be ſaid, that the Goſpel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs
uc concerning Repentance, which <hi>Melancthon</hi> allows to it, and that
herein it doth not exerciſe its proper and peculiar Office, but only employs
the Miniſtry of the Law, I ſhall afterward ſhew.</p>

               <hi>John Calvin,</hi> to mention whoſe Name ſufficeth, without attempting to

According to the Mind of this truly Great Man, if you take the Goſpel in the
more extenſive Senſe of the Word, it ſounds nothing but Promiſes, tho com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
thoſe too which were offer'd to the Saints of the Old Teſtament:
but take the word in the ſtricteſt Senſe, and it ſignifies the clearer and fuller
Diſcoveries of God's Infinite Mercies and Free Grace, as revealed in Chriſt
Jeſus. And as for inveſting Chriſt with a new Legiſlative Power, and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
the Goſpel with the Title of a <hi>new Law,</hi> he calls it a meer Fiction.

               <hi>Beza</hi> is as well known as <hi>Calvin;</hi> and tho from the Deciſions of the beſt of
Men, in Matters of Faith, there muſt always be an Appeal to the Scriptures,
yet by all to whom the Truths of the Goſpel are dear and precious, there hath
ever been a great Deference paid to the Judgment of theſe two Learned Men in
Divinity. He briefly tells the comprehenſive Sum of the Goſpel, without one
Word inſerted about Law or Works.<note n="c" place="bottom">Summa enim Evangelii, quod eſt Dei potentia ad ſalutem cuivis credenti, haec eſt, Chriſtum apprehendere ut factum nobis à Deo ſapientiam, juſtitiam, ſanctificationem, ac redemptionem. <hi>Beza</hi> de Haeret. puniend. pag. 99.

               <hi>which is the Power of God to Salvation to every Believer, is this,</hi> that it teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
us <hi>to lay hold on Chriſt, as made to us of God Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification

publiſh'd to the World, that we may be freely juſtified and ſanctified in Chriſt,
apprehended by Faith, as we have in its proper place copiouſly demonſtrated;
They (viz.</hi> the Papiſts) <hi>on the contrary think the Evangelical Doctrine to be
nothing elſe but a certain Law, more perfect than that of</hi> Moſes. Thus this
Pious and Learned Man, when he gives the Summary of the Goſpel, makes
not the leaſt Figure to denote Law or Works; ſo that according to his
reckoning, they belong not to the Sum, ſince he leaves them out in his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.
And in the other Inſtance, he, with ſome Indignation, rejects the
Notion of the Goſpel's being a Law, as an Article of the Popiſh Faith. The
ſame Worthy Author, writing againſt <hi>Sebaſtianus Caſtalio,</hi> (for he had not
only the perplexing Trouble to refute the Reaſons of the Papiſts, but to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
the Cavils of the <hi>Semi-Pelagians</hi>) makes the diſtinguiſhing Mark of the
Goſpel from the Law to be this, that the Goſpel is no other than the Doctrine
of the Free Grace of God. For proving that there are two Parts of God's
Will reveal'd; one which concerns meerly our Duty, which is the Law;
and the other, which contains nothing but the joyful diſcovery of God's
gracious Purpoſes to ſave us by Chriſt the Redeemer;<note n="b" place="bottom">Nulla tamen in Lege mentio hujus beneficii.

               <hi>The Goſpel</hi>
(ſays he) <hi>is defin'd almoſt by all in this manner. The Goſpel is a good and ſweet
Word, and a moſt certain Teſtimony of the Divine Favour towards us in
Chriſt exhibited to Relievers.</hi> Or, <hi>The Goſpel is the moſt clear Sentence of
the Eternal God, brought down to us from Heaven, abſolving all Believers

               <hi>Hieronymus Zanchius</hi> was an Italian, who left his Country with <hi>Peter Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr</hi>
for the Sake of the Goſpel, in whoſe Writings, as the Truths for which he
ſuffer'd the loſs of all things, are nobly vindicated, ſo a Vivacity of Spirit,
which is ſo natural to that Nation, ſhines in them. And it is a Wonder in
him, as well as <hi>Calvin,</hi> that a Man who wrote ſo much, ſhould write ſo well.
He gives us his Suffrage alſo for the ſame Truth, and in every Page almoſt of
his three large Volumes, he aſſerts the Goſpel to be a ſincere Doctrine of
Grace without any Mixture. And on all Occaſions doth clear the diſtinct
Nature of Law and Goſpel from that Confuſion, in which by ſome in his
Time they were involv'd. Having firſt divided the whole Word of God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
two Parts, Law and Goſpel, and not to confound the Natures of Things
ſo diſtinct, having deſcrib'd the Law in its Being, Properties and Office,
that 'tis peculiar to it, to inſtruct us what Duties to perform, what Sins to
avoid; that it points to us what is a Crime, and ſhews what it deſerves,
and accuſeth Sinners, and reveals the Wrath of God, and threatens the meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Puniſhment: Having thus clearly and diſtinctly ſtated the Nature of the
Law, of which the Goſpel partakes not in the leaſt, and having aſſign'd its
ſeveral Offices, with which the Goſpel intermeddles not at all, nor crowds it
ſelf into them, he then as diſtinctly explains the Nature of this Goſpel.

and deſperate Rebels. It is thus the Angels, (who certainly with the greateſt
Exactneſs diſcharg'd their Commiſſion) without one word of Chriſt's being
a new Legiſlator, or coming as a ſecond <hi>Moſes</hi> to deliver a new Law from
Mount <hi>Zion,</hi> as he did from <hi>Sinai,</hi> proclaim the Goſpel to be a moſt ſolemn
Declaration of God's gracious Deſigns and Purpoſes to Sinners unworthy of
his Favour, <hi>Luke 2. 13, 14. And ſuddenly there was with the Angel a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of the Heavenly Hoſt praiſing God, and ſaying, Glory to God in the
Higheſt, and on Earth Peace, good Will towards Men.</hi> Thus in the firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery
of this glad Meſſage, there is no Voice but of Peace, no ſtounding
Claps of Thunder, as from <hi>Sinai</hi> at the Promulgation of the Law, but the
Songs of Angels rejoicing in the reſtor'd Happineſs of Elect Men, their Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Creatures;
no affrighting Flaſhes of Lightning, but a ſoft and gentle
Brightneſs ſhining from the Face of a reconciled God, and diffuſing it ſelf
through the Air without any hurtful or conſuming Flame; <hi>Luk. 2. 9. And lo, the
Angel of the Lord came upon them, and the Glory of the Lord ſhone round about
them, and they were ſore afraid.</hi> Tho they were a little aſtoniſh'd at the firſt
appearance of ſo ſtrange and unuſual a Sight, yet the Senſe which they had,
that it was only an innocent lambent Fire about their Heads; and the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49801:20"/>
words of the Angel reaſſur'd them, <hi>ver.</hi> 10, 11. It is not a Judg, but
a Saviour who is come into the World; nor are there any Threatnings de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd
as at the giving of a Law are neceſſary, but they hear Promiſes of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
There is no Sentence of Death given, nor Warrants iſſued out for the
Execution of guilty Criminals; but God the Father honours his Son's Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
with a large and very comprehenſive Act of Pardon. When this his Son,
his Solace and Delight in Eternal Ages, before any Creatures made, ſteps
down from Heaven, he doth not meerly declare the great Pleaſure and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
he hath in this glorious God-Man, but he evidenceth how dear this
infinitely excellent Perſon is to him, in the moſt ſurprizing Effects of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Grace. He proclaims, that for his ſake only he can regard his Elect
of Men with Eyes of Favour and Kindneſs, who in their own Perſons were
only Objects of Deteſtation and Abhorrence. And therefore tho he freely
lov'd them from Eternity, his Benevolence was never openly publiſh'd till
now. As it is only for the ſake of Chriſt, whom God infinitely loves, that
he can take any delight in his choſen Children of Men, ſo 'tis not till this his
great and adorable Son comes upon Earth, that he proclaims Peace and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will
to Men.</p>
            <p>Thus God from Heaven, and ſome of the beſt Men who ever liv'd upon
Earth, do plainly tell us that the Goſpel is no Law, but a pure Act of Grace.
And as God ſent theſe Men into the World to reſtore his Truth, to recover it
out of the Darkneſs of Popery, in which the Nations of the Earth had for ſo
many Ages loſt themſelves, and been wretchedly deluded by the worſt of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
dreſs'd up in the faint Reſemblance of Truth; they were anſwerably
faithful to the performance of that Work which God had ſent them to do.
They were careful to diſtinguiſh the Goſpel from a Law, and would by no
means ſuffer Works, tho inſinuating themſelves under never ſo ſpecious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,

of the word <hi>Law,</hi> confounded Law and Goſpel, laid the Root of the moſt
pernicious Errors to ſpring up and overſpread the Church with nothing but
Tares, or worſer Weeds, in the room of nourſhing Corn. They were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
that the perplexed Thoughts of Law and Goſpel chain'd together, by
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49801:21"/>
the unnatural Mixture gave Birth to that monſtrous Metamorphoſis by which
the Monks transform'd the Goſpel into a Law; and as they were not at all ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
that the proper Remedy to cure theſe diſtemper'd Thoughts, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
to diſtinguiſh between the one and the other, they ſutably made a good
and ſucceſsful uſe of it: They would give every thing its proper Name ſutable
to its Nature. If they ſpoke of Works, they meant a Law preſcribing them,
and commanding Obedience under ſevere Penalties; but then in thus think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
ſpeaking, or writing, the Goſpel never came into their Minds, nor was
form'd in their Voice, nor dropp'd from their Pens. But whenever an <hi>Idea</hi>
or Notion of Grace aroſe in their Minds, then indeed the next following
Thought was the Goſpel of Chriſt. By thus reducing theſe two Notions into
due Rank and Order, they baffled all the ſophiſtical Cavils of the Monks, and
afterward of the more cunning Jeſuits, and made War againſt Antichriſt with
Succeſs and Victory: for to drive that Man of Sin out of his dark Corners,
and hiding-Places, is indeed to conquer him. In purſuing ſuch a Conqueſt,
theſe fam'd Divines of the firſt Reformation, once too much ador'd, and now
as much deſpis'd, wrote and preach'd the pure ſincere Grace of the Goſpel
to the People. It was by this alone Doctrine, unaſſiſted by any humane Policy
or Force, that they blew up all the Forts of the dark Papal Kingdom; and
conquering all before them, planted the glorious Enſigns of our Bleſſed Lord
Jeſus, in the Room of the Roman Standards. Thus <hi>Chemnitius,</hi> who was
a perfect Maſter in the Art of attaquing Antichriſt in her ſtrongeſt Holds;
ſince he ſo proſperouſly ſtorm'd and demoliſh'd the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> ſhews
what were the Inſtruments of this Spiritual Warfare us'd by him that had the
greateſt Force.<note n="a" place="bottom">Et quae alia Lux diſcuſſit denſiſſimas tenebras Regni Pontificii niſi haec praecipuè, quod demonſtratum eſt verum diſcrimen Legis, &amp; Evangelii? <hi>Chemnitius,</hi> Ibid. pag. 562.</note> 
               <hi>What other Light</hi> (ſays he) <hi>hath diſpers'd the moſt thick
Darkneſs of the Papal Kingdom, but this chiefly, the true Difference of the
Law and Goſpel before demonſtrated?</hi> And this Difference he had ſtated, that
the Law conſiſts purely of Works, and the Goſpel of all Grace.</p>
            <p>This might be ſufficient to inform us, in what Senſe we are to apprehend
the Expreſſions of any of the Reformed Divines, when they give the Name
of a <hi>Law</hi> to the <hi>Goſpel:</hi> for ſince this ſignifies no more among them than the
joyful News of God's Mercy and Love, and his being reconciled to Sinners in
the Blood of his Son, the meaning of the Word <hi>Law,</hi> when attributed to
this Goſpel, that it may be ſutable and conſiſtent with ſuch a Notion of it,
muſt deſign nothing more than a Doctrine of Grace and Peace. But if I now
bring Inſtances, that they tell us in ſo many expreſs words, that when they
call the Goſpel a <hi>Law,</hi> they intend the Word in no other Senſe than this alledg'd,
it will clear the puzzled Cauſe, and leave no remaining Doubt of their true
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:49801:21"/>
Senſe and Meaning. I will not multiply Citations, one or two are enough;
and indeed <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> are an Army alone.</p>

Prerequiſite of Juſtification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well then, when we meet with the word Law, if we would not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
on by the meer Sound of a Word, we muſt carefully view the Text on
all ſides, and ſurvey and conſider all its Circumſtances. When what is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to the Goſpel is attributed to the Law, the word Law is not to be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
in the ſtrict Senſe, as ſignifying a Rule of Duty, and threatning Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties
to the Diſobedient; or as importing a Doctrine of Works, but a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Grace. Thus when the Law is ſaid to turn the Soul, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice
the Heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 8, 9. ſince theſe are not the Effects of the Law, as
a Doctrine of Works; for that rather effects a Senſe of Wrath, than any
hope in the Heart of a guilty condemned Sinner; and its Efficacy is more
ſuted to wound him with anxious Fears, or tormenting Deſpair, rather than
to comfort him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 15. we muſt by no means conceive a proper Law,
conſiſting of Precepts and Menaces, to be meant, but the Doctrine of the
Mercies of God in Chriſt, which only can have thoſe Virtues and Influences.
And ſo when the Apoſtle too calls the Goſpel a <hi>Law of Faith,</hi> ſince he
makes the Righteouſneſs of the Law oppoſite to the Righteouſneſs which is
of Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 4, 5, 6. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 20, 21, 22. he muſt conſequently
mean not a Law in the ſtrict Senſe, not a Doctrine of Works, but of pure
Grace. And by this Rule we are to proceed; when we find the Goſpel call'd
a Law, we are not to underſtand it in the ſtrict meaning, as a Rule of Duty
with a Sanction, which is the proper and peculiar Nature of the Moral Law,
but as a revealed Inſtruction to us, what the Mind of God is concerning our
Recovery and Salvation by Chriſt. And when we hear of the Precepts and
Threatnings of the Goſpel, and read them in that part of the Bible which we
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:49801:23"/>
call the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> whether in the Sermons of our Saviour, or in the
Writings of the Apoſtles, we are not to ſurmiſe preſently, that theſe are any
Parts of the Goſpel, properly ſo titled, as it is a Word of Grace, and the
Doctrine of our Redemption by Jeſus, tho they are contain'd in that Book to
which we commonly give that Name: For this would be to perplex our No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Things which are entirely diſtinct in their Natures and <hi>Idea's,</hi> and to
jumble them ſo confuſedly together, that we ſhould not be able, upon ſight, to
diſcern and know one from the other. For by the ſame Method of proceeding, I
might frame an Imagination to my ſelf, and ſtrive to impoſe it on other Men,
that the Moral Law is the Goſpel, becauſe there are ſo many Declarations of
God's Love to Sinners, of his Mercies to pardon them, and ſo many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
of Grace interſpers'd in the <hi>Pſalms</hi> and Prophets, and other Books of
the Old Teſtament; all which, tho ſo much of the Goſpel be contain'd in
it, is ſo frequently call'd the <hi>Law,</hi> both by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Fathers, and Proteſtant Divines. So that in a Word, as the Promiſes of
the Goſpel ſpread through the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, is no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to prove the Law to be the Goſpel: So it is as falſe a Demonſtration that
the Goſpel is a Law, becauſe there are ſo many Precepts and Threatnings re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
in the Evangeliſts and Epiſtles. All that can be concluded is, that as
there are Promiſes in one Volume of the Bible, ſo there are Commands and
Menaces in the other: But yet as it is the Goſpel which promiſes Grace in the
Firſt, ſo it is the Law which commands and threatens in the Second. And to
clear the Equation, it is only needful to bring all the Precepts in both to
one ſide, and the Promiſes to another, and then we have diſtinct Law and
Goſpel.</p>

            <p>IT is now very eaſy to anſwer my Reverend Brother's Arguments, and with
one gentle Stroke to wipe off all his Citations, ſince they all are eſtabliſh'd
meerly upon the Ambiguities of the word <hi>Law.</hi> Such reaſoning is very fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious,
to endeavour to prove the Goſpel to be a new Rule of Duty, forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with a Sanction, becauſe we find it to be nam'd a <hi>Law,</hi> both in the
Scriptures and Humane Writings: for the Sum of the whole Demonſtration
amounts to no more than this, a Law is a Law, the Goſpel is a Law, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Goſpel is a Law; which is a pretty way of arguing, and without
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:49801:24"/>
doubt unanſwerable. But the clearing the Senſe of the Terms, anſwers all
without any more to do; which I think I have done, and the more largely,
becauſe I would do all the Juſtice to a bad Cauſe as could reaſonably be ask'd,
and allow to it the fulleſt Scope and Play poſſible. I have therefore offer'd Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
for it my ſelf, I have conſider'd what might be alledg'd, I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
thoſe Scriptures which with any colour may be urg'd to prove the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
to be a new Law, omitted by my Learned Brother; and yet as aware
that they might be ſummon'd, I have brought them in, and endeavour'd to
clear their Words from that falſe Meaning which might be faſten'd on them to
ſo ill a Purpoſe. I ſhall now particularly conſider thoſe which he brings, and
ſhew that they do not prove the Matter in Diſpute.</p>
            <p>His firſt ſet of Scriptures are ſuch as expreſs the Goſpel to be either giving
Precepts, and iſſuing out Commands, and preſcribing what is our Duty; or
reproving the Negligent, or threatning the ſtubborn Offenders, or promiſing
Bleſſings on the Condition of ſuch Duties perform'd as are requir'd. It would
make this Diſcourſe too large, which is, I know not how, grown under my
Hands to a greater Bulk than I firſt deſign'd, if I ſhould particularly examine
every Text; it will be enough to ſhew, that however there are Precepts and
Commands in the Books of the New Teſtament, yet theſe are not properly
the Goſpel, but parts of the Law, only employ'd in its Service; that the
Threatnings denounc'd do not properly belong to the Covenant of Grace,
(for what hath Love, and Mercy, and Favour, to do with Wrath, and Juſtice,
and Expreſſions of Vengeance?) but it uſeth the Miniſtry only of a violated
Law, whoſe proper Office it is to threaten the Diſobedient, to condemn the
Unbelieving and Impenitent Sinner, and to demand Juſtice againſt him. If I
alſo ſhew at laſt that thoſe places of Scripture (which look like Promiſes of
Bleſſings to us, on condition that we perform the commanded Duties) view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
nearly, prove to be no more than ſo many Declarations of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
of the Bleſſings of Grace; and that as Faith is the firſt beſtow'd, it
goes not alone, but is attended with a numerous Off-ſpring: When all
this is done, then the right Senſe of thoſe Texts which ſeem to infer to be a
Condition of our Juſtification by this Evangelical Law, will be fully clear'd;
the meaning of the alledg'd Scriptures will be ſo plain, as it will appear that
they do not ſo much as look towards the favouring that Opinion of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
being a new Law, for which they are produc'd.</p>
            <p>That the Precepts which the Goſpel employs, are not any Parts of it ſelf,
but borrowed from the Law, will be undoubted, if we conſider what is their
Nature and Uſe. They are deſign'd as the Rule of our Actions; they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
us what to do; they draw the Lines of our Duty, and ſet the Limits of
our Obedience; and all this is the proper Office of the Moral Law, which it
compleatly diſcharges, without calling in any Aſſiſtance. It is the eternal and
unalterable Rule of Manners, and a Doctrine directing the whole Conduct of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:49801:24"/>
Humane Life: There is no Defect in it, which it was needful to ſupply by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
new Law; to aſſert that, would be to impeach the Wiſdom of God
as deficient, as not knowing at firſt all that was Good and Righteous, and
neceſſary to be commanded to his Creatures, and to be done by them; or as
ſo ſhort in its Foreſight, as not able to diſcern at the firſt all the Duties which
Men were bound to perform in the Circumſtances of their State, but was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
afterward, taught by Experience, to ſupply the Failures by a new Law,
or by an Addition of new Precepts ſuted to Man's preſent ſtate of Sin, Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Miſery. If then the Moral Law did not comprehend in it all Precepts
of Duties, it would not be God's Law, for his is perfect; he is not like
ſhort-ſighted Men, who cannot foreſee what the Conſequences of a Law made
by them may be within the Compaſs of one Age; nor whether Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Affairs altering, it may not prove hurtful or unneceſſary; and therefore
all Governments find themſelves oblig'd to repeal old Laws, or to add ſome
Clauſes to ſute them to a preſent Poſture of Affairs, or to make new Ones to
repair the Defects, to which all Humane Wiſdom in her beſt Proviſions is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious,
for want of a certain Foreknowledg of the Future. But who
can have ſuch a Thought of God, that theſe Infirmities of a Man ſhould ever
befal him in making his Laws, that he ſhould be forc'd, tho not to repeal
what he had made ſo many Ages before, yet to promulgate a new one, with
additional Precepts accommodated to the preſent Caſe of his miſerable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Man? And as it is repugnant to God's Perfections to make new Laws,
ſo it would infer that his antiquated Law was imperfect, and ſo no Rule; and
this would unavoidably follow, if any Duties are to be perform'd which it
neither regulates, nor gives any direction about them. But Chriſt tho as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator
he is no Law-giver, yet perfectly knows the Nature of the Law given
at Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> that the Law contains all Duties, for he makes the Sum of
it to conſiſt in Love to God, and in a due degree of Love to our ſelves, and
in loving our Neighbour, <hi>Matth. 22. 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40. Then one of them
which was a Lawyer, asked him a queſtion, tempting him, and ſaying, Maſter,
which is the great Commandment in the Law? Jeſus ſaid unto him, Thou ſhalt
love the Lord thy God with all thy Heart, and with all thy Soul, and with all
thy Mind. This is the firſt and great Commandment. And the Second is
like unto it, Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf. On theſe two Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments
hang all the Law and the Prophets.</hi> Now it will be very difficult to
give an Inſtance of any Duty which we owe to him our Great Creator, or to
our ſelves, or to Men our Fellow-Creatures, which are not included in one of
thoſe two Tables, or to name a Precept which may not be reduced to them. The
Scripture alledg'd is the more demonſtrative for this Reaſon, that our Lord
Chriſt's Anſwer is to a Man enquiring concerning his Duty; and then, if at any
time, there was occaſion to mention this new Law, and to have told him the
additional Precepts, had there been any ſuch things. But Chriſt ſends him
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:49801:25"/>
to the Moral Law, as comprehending all that Man was to do, and as a perfect
Rule of Duty ſufficient compleatly to inſtruct him. And indeed what more
can be requir'd of Man, than to love God with all the Powers and Faculties
of his Soul, and to love himſelf as he ought to do, and his Neighbour in
like meaſure?</p>
            <p>When Chriſt alſo comes into the World, and was made under the Law,
which never had before, nor will ever have again ſo glorious a Subject, it
is this Law he not only explains in its ſpiritual and comprehenſive Meaning,
but obeys it, and therein fulfils all Righteouſneſs, <hi>Mat. 5. 17. Think not that
I am come to deſtroy the Law or the Prophets: I am not come to deſtroy, but to
fulfil.</hi> Mat. 3. 15. <hi>And Jeſus anſwering, ſaid unto him, Suffer it to be ſo
now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all Righteouſneſs. Then he ſuffered him.</hi>
And what! is that Law imperfect, which was the Rule of the moſt perfect
Obedience that ever was, and which excell'd that of Angels? Are any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
wanting in it? how then did Chriſt compleat all Righteouſneſs in the
moſt exact obſervance of it? Well then, if the Law be perfect, there is no
Duty but what comes within the Verge of its Authority, and what it enjoins
under the ſevereſt Penalties; and no Precepts were given even by Chriſt himſelf,
but what particularly appertain to it, and not to the Goſpel as a new Law: It
is not only our Schoolmaſter to bring us to Chriſt, but it commands to believe
on him; for Faith in God (and Chriſt is ſo) is contain'd in its firſt Precept: it
not only ſhews us our Sin, and convinceth us of our Miſery and loſt State; but
when we have believ'd, tho it be no longer a condemning, vexing, torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Law, yet 'tis a commanding One ſtill: It is a Rule of Gratitude, it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes,
that we ought to be thankful to Chriſt in all Returns of Love and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
it is the Rule of all that Holy Life of a Chriſtian, which is the Fruit of
Faith, and which is call'd <hi>Evangelical Obedience,</hi> not becauſe it is ſo to the
Goſpel, but in reſpect of thoſe Principles of Faith and Love from which it
flows, in reſpect of the Evangelical Motives which animate and encourage it.
It is not hurried on by legal Terrors, nor prick'd forward by ſharp-pointed
Threatnings, but is ſweetly drawn and enliven'd by the Promiſes. It is not
the Fruits of Fear, but the genuine Effects of the heartieſt Affection to Chriſt,
and of the moſt earneſt Deſires and ſolicitous Cares to pleaſe him.</p>
            <p>I know that it will be ſaid, That tho thoſe Precepts in the Goſpel, which
command and direct Moral Duties, appertain to the Moral Law, yet Faith in
Chriſt the Redeemer, and Repentance, do not ſeem to be in the leaſt ſo much
as hinted in any of its Commands: For ſince the Law was given as a Rule of
the Actions of Holy and Innocent Creatures, who needed not a Redeemer,
there could be no occaſion to command them to believe on One; and <hi>Adam</hi>
in his State of Integrity, was no more oblig'd to ſuch a Faith, than the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Angels are to believe on the Saviour of loſt and wretched Men. And ſince
Repentance is a Duty too, which preſuppoſeth the Perſon engag'd to it, to
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:49801:25"/>
be an Offender, and guilty, How could it be commanded to a Creature who
had never ſinned? How could it be a Duty for him to own his Crime with
Shame and Sorrow, who never yet had tranſgreſſed, or prevaricated in his
Obedience? Since therefore Faith in Chriſt, and Repentance, are Duties which
ſuppoſe the Man to be a Sinner, it would ſeem that ſuch Precepts are not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
in a Law given to him before his Fall; but are the proper Precepts of a
ſecond Remedial Law, which God hath provided for the Relief and Help of this
miſerable Creature.</p>
            <p>This I muſt confeſs looks very plauſible at firſt ſight, and the Argument
ſeems to be ſtrongly concluſive. But if we conſider the Nature of Faith, it will
be manifeſt, that it was not only commanded to <hi>Adam</hi> in Innocence, and that
it was his Duty, but that it is abſolutely neceſſary to every holy and good
Creature: For if we take it as an Act of the Mind, aſſenting readily to all that
God reveals, as infallibly true, it is that to which every Creature in the right
Conſtitution of his Being, is indiſpenſably oblig'd. It is the Duty of Angels
themſelves to believe that Jeſus is the Son of God, that he is the Saviour of
Elect Men; that the Pardon and Juſtification of a Sinner, is by his Blood and
Righteouſneſs alone; that God's Juſtice is ſatisfied by the Sacrifice of his Son.
For all theſe Truths being publiſh'd, and made known by God for the Illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his infinite Mercy among all his rational Creatures; and that the Praiſes
of his Free Grace might reſound as well in the Songs of Angels, as from the
Mouths of Men; it is needful, and required as a Duty from them both, who
are to honour God in the Celebration of all his Attributes, that they heartily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
all theſe Truths of the Goſpel, in which alone God's Perfections of Mercy
and Grace do illuſtriouſly ſhine forth. And as for Man in Innocence, though
it was not in expreſs Terms required from him to believe the Goſpel not yet
revealed to him, or to act Faith on Chriſt undiſcovered; yet ſuch a Command
was included, and implied in that general one, that he ſhould without any
Doubt or Heſitancy give Credit to all that God ſaid: and that as he was to
believe the Sincerity of God's Promiſe, and the Reality of his Threatnings
when the Covenant of Works was made with him, and without doubt he acted
ſuch a Faith; ſo by the ſame Precept he was commanded and bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
every word which God afterward ſhould ſpeak to him, and without ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous
diſputing preſently aſſent to thoſe Truths which were to be reveal'd,
aſſoon as it appear'd to him that they were ſo. So that indeed the Belief of
the Goſpel, and Faith in Chriſt Jeſus, were comprehended in this general Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of Believing in God: and indeed Chriſt himſelf tells us ſo, and uſeth it
as an Argument why they ſhould act Faith on him, becauſe they were oblig'd
to it by the ſame Command which required them to believe on God; <hi>John</hi>
14. 1. <hi>Let not your Heart be troubled; ye believe in God, believe alſo in me.</hi>
If we regard too the other Act of Faith, which is a firm Reliance of the Soul
upon God, and heartily truſting of him, and chearfully committing all our
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:49801:26"/>
Concernments, our Life, our Happineſs, all we enjoy or hope for, to his faithful
Love and Care; this was certainly our firſt Father's Duty, and given in Precept
to him in the Law, as well as the other of aſſenting to all that God declared as
undoubtedly true. And indeed, if it was <hi>Adam</hi>'s Duty in his Primitive Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
to believe in God, it was commanded by the Law; for that only could
make it become ſo. And what! can we ever wildly imagine, that our firſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was not bound to act Faith on God his Creator, and conſtant Benefactor,
and upon whom he was to have a perpetual Dependance, or he could not live
a moment? What! can we think, that to have rejected God's Word as of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected
Truth, to have refuſed, or but to have ſuſpended his Aſſent to it when
propos'd, had been no fault in him? That to have diſtruſted God, to have
renounced Dependance on him, would not have been a Crime the greateſt as
could be committed by him? But all this is the unavoidable Conſequence of
this Aſſertion, That the Precept of Faith is not in the Law; for neither would
Faith have been a Duty, nor Unbelief a Sin to <hi>Adam,</hi> had not the Law, which
was the only Rule of his Obedience, commanded the one and forbidden the
other. Were it not for this, he might have been a ſtubborn obſtinate Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
without being a Sinner; when on the contrary, it appears from the ſhort
Relation of his Apoſtacy, that Unbelief was his very firſt Sin. For what is Faith,
but to truſt in God upon his Word and Promiſe for all our Life and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?
and what is Unbelief but to diſtruſt him? And was not <hi>Adam,</hi> while
flouriſhing in his State Innocence, a real and ſincere Believer? and ſo long as
he perſiſted in acting Faith, did he not continue to be happy? And was it not
the Neglect of the due Exerciſe of Faith, which at laſt plung'd him into the
Depths of Miſery and Deſpair? As long as he believed God, and entirely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fided
in him; as long as he lived in conſtant Dependance upon the Love and
Care of his Creator; as long as he thankfully acknowledged, that he received
all the Bleſſings of Life as the Fruits of his Bounty; as long as he truſted in
God upon his Word, that he would not only continue them unto him, but
beſtow greater to come, which by the Promiſe he had reaſon to hope for and
expect; all this time he liv'd by Faith, and his Days were clear and happy,
and it was Unbelief made all his Glories ſet in a gloomy Evening. It was this
begun his Apoſtacy, not exerciſing Faith any longer, he would throw off his
Dependance upon God, and ſeek to be bleſs'd in ſome new and fond Way of
his own. He indulg'd a ſurmizing Thought, that God, whoſe ſolemn Promiſe
he had ſo freſhly heard, either could not, or was not willing to make him ſo
happy as he aſpir'd to be, and that he refuſed to advance him to thoſe degrees
of Bliſs, of which he fancied himſelf capable: And thus he ceas'd acting that
Faith in God, on which depended his Life and Bleſſedneſs; he disbelieved
God, and believed the Devil his greateſt Enemy, and ſinned, and died. And
I know not but that he deſerved the Execution of the Sentence and Curſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
againſt him, more by his Unbelief than by Eating the Apple: And
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:49801:26"/>
that even the Law of Works condemn'd him as much for that Sin, as for the
outward Act of his Diſobedience. Ay, but it will be ſaid, All this doth not
prove that Faith in Chriſt was commanded by the Law, and required of him as
his Duty. No, it is enough that Faith in God was ſo, to prove that the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
belongs to the Law. For if it is ſufficient to argue from the Law's not
directing this its own commanded Act, to ſuch an Object as Chriſt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,
that therefore it gives no Precept and Command of Believing, but
that it is the peculiar Office of the Goſpel to do ſo; that becauſe this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Kind of Faith is not ſpecified, and this Way of Acting it on Chriſt particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
expreſs'd, that therefore the Duty of Believing comes not within the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
of its Commands: I might at this rate of Arguing, prove that the Act of
Eating the fatal Fruit was no Sin, becauſe not expreſly forbidden by the Law;
for that regarded it as a thing indifferent, as indeed it was before the Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
and yet this deſtroying Act of his was a Sin, and forbidden by the
Law, tho not in a particular Precept, yet as involv'd in that great One, which
commanded him to obey God in whatever he ſhould require.</p>
            <p>It doth not therefore by any conſequence follow, that the Goſpel is a new
Law becauſe it commands Faith as a Duty, and threatens Unbelief, ſince the
old Law had done the ſame before, and the Goſpel only imploys its Precepts,
and applies them to its own Deſign and Uſe. To ſay that we are enjoin'd in
the Goſpel to believe on Chriſt as the Redeemer, to deliver us from Sin and
Death, will not weaken the Force of the Argument urg'd; for the Act even of
this Faith is commanded by the Law, and is its proper Precept: That which
belongs to the Goſpel, is to direct this Act to an Object ſuted and proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to help us in the Miſery of our preſent ſinful State. <hi>Adam</hi> was by the Law
commanded to believe, and truſt in God for the Preſervation and Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of him in Happineſs. And we are commanded to truſt in the ſame God
for the Reſtoring this loſt Happineſs, and our Recovery of it again. The Act
and Object of Faith, is the ſame (Chriſt being God), and all the Difference is
only made by that which is the Circumſtance (tho a deplorable one) of our
own Perſons. But this will not alter the Nature of the Faith it-ſelf; for if
ſo, then according to the Variety of theſe ſad Caſes and Exigences wherein
we truſt on Chriſt, our Faith would alter to a different Nature. Since then
the Faith of <hi>Adam,</hi> which the Moral Law commanded him to act on God,
was a Truſt in him that he would preſerve his innocent Creature in all the
Bleſſedneſs of his primitive Condition; and the Faith of a Sinner coming to
Chriſt for Life, is a Truſt in the ſame God, (he being the ſecond Perſon of the
Divinity) that he will reſtore his wretched Creature to its loſt Happineſs, the
Faith is the ſame in both Inſtances as to the Nature of it, (tho the Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the Perſons are different:) and therefore if our firſt Father was by the
Moral Law commanded to believe on God, the ſame Precept requires, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth
Sinners to believe on the eternal Son of God.</p>
            <pb n="48" facs="tcp:49801:27"/>
            <p>I know that with a ſcornful Smile it will be ſaid, that it is an abſurd Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to affirm the Precept of Faith to belong to the Law, when the Command
of believing on Chriſt is perpetually repeated in the Goſpel, which only diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
this Saviour of Sinners. It is granted, that we meet with this Precept in
all the Books of the New Teſtament; but then the Objectors muſt alſo grant,
that we find there too the Precepts of loving Chriſt, of abandoning all things,
and denying our ſelves for his Sake, of loving our Enemies, of the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
due from Children to their Parents, of the ſincere Service which Servants
owe to their Maſters: and now if the Goſpel is not a New Law in requiring
theſe Duties, which were all commanded by the old one, it will no more be
a new Law for commanding us to believe, ſince this hath been demonſtrated
to be a Precept of the old Law as well as any of the other. All therefore which
can be inferr'd is, that the Goſpel borrows theſe Precepts from the old Moral
Law, (and then they are not properly its own Commands) and employs them
in its Service, and for the Intereſts of our Salvation; or to ſpeak briefly and
clearly, in the Words of the Holy Ghoſt himſelf, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 19. the Moral Law is in
the hands of Chriſt our Mediator, and made by him to ſubſerve his gracious
Deſigns.</p>
            <p>The other pretended peculiar Precept of this new Law, is Repentance; and
if I then prove, that by virtue of the old Law, which was a perfect Rule of
Duty, this alſo was enjoin'd, and Sinners oblig'd to it, this will evince, that
neither this is the proper Command of the Goſpel. It cannot be denied, that
all which is juſtly due from one Perſon to another, is required in the Moral
Law; for it is a compleat Rule of Righteouſneſs. It can as little be diſputed
that an hearty Acknowledgment of the Wrong with Shame and Sorrow, from
a Man who hath injur'd another, is due to the offended Party; and common
Reaſon and Juſtice doth engage Men to this, tho no other Reparations can be
made. The owning then of our Offences with the moſt inward Mourning,
and deepeſt Deteſtation of them, is much more due to God, our Sovereign and
Supream Lord, tho we are incapable by all this of making him the leaſt Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.
To confeſs a Fault, and to expreſs a real Trouble for having done it,
is indeed among Men a making ſome amends to the wronged Perſon; for it is
ſome Security that he ſhall not be hurt by a ſecond Injury: But all our Sorrow,
and Confeſſion of Sins with Tears, cannot in any degree ſatisfy, nor repair the
Diſhonour and Indignity offer'd unto God. It is yet our Duty to throw our
ſelves at his Feet, to expreſs an Abhorrence of our hainous Rebellion againſt
him; and it is a Duty to which we are bound as Creatures to our Maker, and
Subjects to our Soveraign, who is Lord over all, God bleſſed for ever. But
what! it will be ſaid, doth the Law require Repentance when it made no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals
of Pardon for the Crime? Doth it require a ſorrowful Acknowledgment
of the Fault; and yet the whole Deſign of it is, that all this ſhall do the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender
no good, ſince it provides not the leaſt Relief for the penitent Sinner?
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:49801:27"/>
To what purpoſe is ſuch a Command, when tho the Sinner ſheds floods of
Tears, and mourns out a Life laſting to Eternity of Ages, there is yet no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
tendred by this Law to prevent his being eternally miſerable? Yes, for
all this, ſuch a Command of Repentance in the Moral Law, is not only to
great purpoſe, but abſolutely neceſſary: for to own to God, with Shame and
Sorrow, the Injury we have done him by our Sins, is a Duty which we owe
to him our offended Soveraign, tho he had never promis'd to forgive us; nay,
tho he had plainly declar'd that he would never be reconcil'd. It is a Duty
then to which <hi>Adam,</hi> after his Fall, was bound by the ſame Law which he
obey'd in his Innocency; to which he was bound, when amaz'd with all
the Horrors of a deſpairing Mind, looking for nothing but Vengeance and Ruin
from the Anger and arm'd Power of the Almighty. It is a Duty to which
he was tied before any new Covenant of Grace made, and before God had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd
any Thoughts of Favour to him, or any Purpoſes of Grace in that
firſt Promiſe of the Seed of the Woman breaking the Serpent's Head. If
then it was <hi>Adam</hi>'s Duty to repent, before he had receiv'd any Promiſes of
Mercy, there muſt be ſome Precept obliging him to it: ſince that, and Duty,
mutually infer one another, no Precept could it be of the Goſpel, for that
was not yet proclaim'd, and therefore it muſt be the proper Precept of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Law, which was the thing to be prov'd.</p>
            <p>If any one will peremptorily deny Repentance to have been <hi>Adam</hi>'s Duty
before God had promis'd Mercy, the ſame Perſon muſt conſequently aſſert,
that it was no Fault in him to run from God; that he did very well in excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
himſelf, in throwing the great Part of the Guilt upon God, in ſtanding
upon his own Juſtification; and that if he had continued an obdurate har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den'd
Wretch, if he had acted as a bold deſperate Rebel, and inſtead of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
his Crimes, and expreſſing his Sorrow, had further dar'd and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brav'd
offended Juſtice, he had been innocent in all this, and had not in the
leaſt broken any Precept of the Law, nor tranſgreſs'd the Bounds of his Duty.
For if Repentance was not commanded before the Goſpel publiſh'd, then the
worſt Impenitence in <hi>Adam</hi> would have been no Sin, becauſe forbidden by no
Law.</p>
            <p>I know very well that <hi>Arminius</hi> boldly affirms all this;<note n="a" place="bottom">Epiſtola Arminii ad Utenbogardum in Epiſtolis praeſtant. viror. Epiſt. 70. pag. 131, 132. Edit. 2. <hi>Amſtel.</hi> 1684.</note> That the
Covenant of Works being broken, the Law was abrogated too, and that
God no longer required Obedience from his ſinful Creature, till he brought in
a new Law, which is the Goſpel, commanding Faith and Repentance; and that
God accepts this Obedience to the Precepts of this his new Law, inſtead of
perfect Obedience to the old violated Moral Law. But I know too very well,
that moſt prodigious and amazing Abſurdities will be the natural Products of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:49801:28"/>
this monſtrous Opinion. It will follow, that the firſt Sin dethron'd God, not
only out of Man's Heart, but out of his Seat of Majeſty in Heaven too, until
to regain his Crown and Dominion, and for the recovery of his loſt Sovereign
Power, he was forced to condeſcend to treat with his Rebels upon lower Terms,
and to propoſe a new and milder Law, accommodated to the weaker Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
of their State. Thus God loſeth his Soveraignty by the Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of his Creature, and his Laws ſignified ſo little, that they were all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal'd
and diſannull'd, when Man would obſerve them no longer. And who
can once think that the Great God ſhould loſe his Power to command,
when his Creatures refus'd any more to obey him, and that Man by becoming
a Rebel, ſhould ceaſe to be a Subject; and that therefore a new Law, giving
new Precepts, and propoſing other more moderate Conditions, was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
needful to adjuſt the deſperate Affair, and to ſet all things right again?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adam</hi> alſo by his Fall having, according to the Aſſertion of <hi>Arminius,</hi> broken
all Ties and Bonds of Obedience, if before the Promulgation of the Goſpel or
new Law to him, he had blaſphem'd God, had ſworn and forſworn, had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled
kindneſs to his Wife with the deepeſt Oaths, while he had nothing in
his Heart but Thoughts of Malice, and Deſigns of Revenge againſt her for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying
him to ruin, had moſt barbarouſly murder'd her, and afterward kill'd
himſelf, he yet had not ſinned in all this; becauſe before the new Law given,
he was oblig'd to no Duty. Believe this who will, for my part I cannot.</p>
            <p>And now, what is the Ground of this deſperate Aſſertion? Why truly on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
this, That becauſe the Law once broken, there were no longer any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
made to the Obedience of a Sinner; therefore the Covenant between
God and Man was entirely vacated, and ſo the Sinner was no longer bound to
obey, till a new Law came with other Precepts of Faith, and making Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
to lower degrees of Duty; and then upon this new Account the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ſtands bound again. Now all this is founded upon one grand Miſtake;
which is, that our Obedience to God is eſtabliſh'd upon his Covenant with
us; and that the only Tie upon us, are Promiſes or Threatnings: Whereas
our Duty to God immediately reſults from the infinite Greatneſs of his Being,
which is therefore ſupream, and hath an undoubted Right to command, and
from the unalterable Relation of a Creature to his Maker. So that <hi>Adam,</hi> as
ſoon as he had Exiſtence, was preſently bound to obey God in all that he
would command him, tho he had made no Promiſe to him of any Reward.
And if God had plac'd him in a diſmal Deſart, inſtead of ſettling him in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe;
if he had ſharpen'd his Life with Sorrows and Miſeries, in the room
of thoſe Bleſſings and Comforts which he enjoy'd, yet he might have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
him all that he pleas'd, and it would have been his Duty to have
paid a ready Obedience. And this clears the Difficulty lying in our way, that
tho the Law made no Promiſes to Sinners, as the Goſpel doth, yet that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
it not from commanding and engaging them to repent; for by what I
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:49801:28"/>
have prov'd, it appears, that Promiſes do not lay the Foundation of a Duty,
but are only the Encouragements of it. Well then, tho <hi>Adam</hi> ſaw not any
thing in the Law to renew Life to a Penitent Offender, tho he could not read
in it one Syllable of a Pardon, yet the ſame Law which requir'd Obedience of
him, commanded after he had ſinn'd, to repent, and return to his Duty; tho
he had no hopes of ſucceeding in it, and had no aſſurance that a juſtly
provoked and angry God would forgive, and deſcry'd not the leaſt Promiſe
ſhining in Heaven to favour him.</p>
            <p>And as it was <hi>Adam</hi>'s Duty to repent, ſo it is the Duty of all Men now
living upon Earth: A Duty, to which Heathens who are not under the Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
of the Goſpel, to whom this new-ſtil'd Law never came, who never
heard a word of its pretended Precepts or real Promiſes, are indiſpenſably
oblig'd. Whence have they this binding Precept of Repentance? From the
Goſpel? How can that be, when the leaſt Sound of it never arriv'd to their
Ears? It muſt therefore neceſſarily be a Precept and Command of the Moral
Law to them, which more or leſs is manifeſted to all, even the moſt ſavage
and barbarous Nations of the Earth.</p>
            <p>The Deſign and Office of the Law doth alſo manifeſt, that the Precept of
Repentance doth properly belong to it: For it was not only appointed as a
Rule of Obedience to <hi>Adam,</hi> but God certainly knowing that Man would
fall into a State of Sin and Death, intended the Law for the Conviction of
Sinners, to ſhew them their Sinfulneſs and Danger, <hi>Rom. 3. 19, 20. Now we know
that what things ſoever the Law ſaith, it ſaith to them who are under the Law;
that every Mouth may be ſtopped, and all the World may become guilty before
God. Therefore by the Deeds of the Law, there ſhall no Fleſh be juſtified in his
ſight: for by the Law is the Knowledg of Sin. Rom.</hi> 7. 7. He deſign'd it to
rouſe and alarm the poor negligent Creatures. And now if it convinceth
them of Sin, its malignant Nature and direful Effects, it conſequently tells
them, that it is their Duty to bewail their Miſcarriages, which bring all Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
upon them, and to reform their evil Courſes, and to turn from Sin to
God. This the Law preacheth to Men, and theſe are the natural Dictates of
it in their Conſciences; and it is impoſſible to perſwade them (till God comes
with the Power of his Grace, and works Faith) againſt putting their
Confidence in their Sorrow and repenting, to obtain Pardon by it, and againſt
truſting to their Reſolutions of living better for the future; and againſt their
fond Preſumption of being juſtified for their endeavours of Amendment,
Theſe legal Principles are natural in Men, they ariſe not from the Goſpel, for
that inſtructs us to put our whole and entire Confidence in Chriſt, and his
Righteouſneſs alone; they muſt then ſpring from the Law, and conſequently
Repentance, which this Law not only urgeth Men unto, but moveth them
to build their Hopes of Life upon it, muſt be one of its Precepts.
The Law commands it, the Goſpel as a Proclamation of Grace, and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:49801:29"/>
an Offer of Pardon only, invites and encourageth it.</p>
            <p>Thus it is ſufficiently prov'd, that Sinners were by the Moral Law oblig'd to
own their Sins with the moſt bewailing Expreſſions of Grief, tho that Law
gave them no Encouragement and Hope; and that <hi>Adam</hi> after his Fall was
engag'd to this Sorrow and Contrition, before any promiſe of Pardon and
Acceptance tendred. If we now conſider the other and chiefeſt part of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
it will be evident that this was not only requir'd of the Father of
Mankind fallen, but that it was his Duty, and what he practis'd in all the
time of his Innocence and flouriſhing Condition: For what is Repentance
mainly, but an hearty abhorrence of Sin, join'd with a moſt careful Avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of it, and a moſt firm Reſolution againſt it? Now this was as ſurely
in <hi>Adam,</hi> when continuing the ſame upright Creature which God had made
him, as it is certain that then he was holy, Holineſs and hatred of Sin being
altogether inſeparable; and therefore unleſs we will ſuppoſe our firſt Father to
have been unholy in his original Being, we muſt not doubt of his daily acting
of this principal and moſt conſiderable part of Repentance. I call it ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is that which to bring forth the other is appointed: for we are not
commanded to mourn, and to bewail our Follies and Miſcarriages, meerly
for the ſake of vexing and tormenting our ſelves, or as if by the inward An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
of our Souls, we were to do Penance to pacify a diſpleaſed God; but
all this trouble of Mind for Sin, is intended and requir'd to imbitter it to us,
and to render us vile in our own Eyes, and to throw us humbled before the
Throne of Grace. For tho we are Sinners, and poor and miſerable, yet we
are naturally proud, and therefore a Senſe of our Sin and Miſery is requiſite to
bring down our haughty Spirits; tho we alſo daily feel the diſmal Miſchiefs
of Sin, yet our deprav'd Natures render us too prone, and readily inclin'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it; and therefore a piercing Sorrow is neceſſary to bring us to that true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
of which I am ſpeaking, which conſiſts in hating Sin, and turning
from it. It is but needful that an aking Wound make us ſenſible of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant
Miſchief of Sin, to render it the Object of our higheſt Averſion.
Well then, it is hatred of Sin, and an hearty reſiſtance of it, which is the laſt
and chiefeſt Act of Repentance, ſince our Sorrow is deſign'd only to produce
this Effect, and ſo after all to hate Sin; and moſt carefully to avoid it, is moſt
truly to repent of it. And this Repentance our firſt Father, even in his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence,
acted to a higher degree than we do, ſince his deteſtation of Sin was
greater; and till the ſad Moments of his Fall, he oppoſed it more firmly and
ſucceſsfully.</p>
            <p>But it will be objected, Repentance ſuppoſeth the Perſon to have ſinn'd,
and therefore a Precept of it to <hi>Adam</hi> in his Uprightneſs was altogether need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.
No not at all, for a Precept to oblige Man to what is due and juſt, is
neceſſary for him in every Condition; and nothing can be more due than to
acknowledg a Wrong done: And what is Repentance, but an hearty own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:49801:29"/>
and lamenting the higheſt Injury offer'd to God by our Sins? And beſides,
God in making a Law, gave ſuch a perfect Rule as was ſufficient to bind Man to
his Duty in all Circumſtances of his Caſe; and therefore it was not only mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell'd
to oblige him to perfect Obedience, but to ingage him to repent when
he had fail'd of his Duty.</p>
            <p>Well, but ſome may argue againſt what I before ſaid concerning Faith's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Precept of the Original Law given to <hi>Adam,</hi> that tho it is true, that Faith
in God is required in the firſt Commandment, yet there is no Faith in a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer
expreſs'd. What then? It is yet plainly implied, ſince this our Redeemer
is God, and therefore a general Command to truſt on God at all Times, and
according to the various Neceſſities of our State, muſt include a Precept to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
on Chriſt the Redeemer, when the ſad State of our Caſe doth require it.</p>
            <p>Ay, but the Law (will they object) was given to Man in Innocence, and
therefore only tied him to ſuch Acts of Obedience as were proper to that
Condition; and therefore ſuch Duties which reſult from Man's being a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
ſuch as Faith and Repentance, were not inclos'd within the compaſs of
this Law. Yes, but they were, and that for the ſame Reaſon as ſuch Duties
which ariſe from the preſent Relations which Men bear to one another, which
are the Conſequents of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall, are comprehended in the Precepts of the
Moral Law. By this a Slave is obliged to perform Service to his Maſter; and
yet if Man had not ſinned, there had been no ſuch thing as Slavery. By this
alſo Judges are bound to do Juſtice in puniſhing Malefactors, and yet in Man's
Primitive State of Integrity, there were no Rogues and Villains, nor any need
of Judges or Sheriffs.</p>
            <p>This is ſtrange indeed (it will be ſaid) to deny the Goſpel to be a Law
commanding Faith and Repentance, when nothing is more frequently inculca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and earneſtly urg'd in the Sermons of Chriſt, and the Writings of the
Apoſtles, than that Sinners ſhould repent, and ſhould believe on him. 'Tis
readily confeſs'd; but yet from what hath been argued, it muſt be own'd,
that theſe are Precepts of the Law made uſe of by the Goſpel, and encourag'd
by its Promiſes. We are not preſently to faſten every thing on the Goſpel,
ſtrictly taken, as it is the Word of Salvation which we find in the Books of
the New Teſtament; and becauſe Chriſt and his Apoſtles give us Rules of
Holineſs, immediately name the Goſpel a <hi>New Law.</hi> For after this rate of
Reaſoning, we may infer too that it is a Book of Lives, becauſe the Life and
Death of our Saviour, and the Acts of the Apoſtles, are recorded in it; that
it is the Levitical Law, becauſe the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi>
inſiſts on ſo many Particulars of it. That it is the Ceremonial Law, becauſe
the ſaid Apoſtle circumcis'd <hi>Timothy,</hi> Act. 16. 1. That it is a Sacred Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle,
and the Annals of the Church, becauſe it contains the Hiſtory of the
Beginnings and firſt Progreſs of Chriſtianity. Thus if we frame Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
by theſe Meaſures, we may make the Goſpel any thing that we pleaſe,
or would fancy it to be.</p>
            <pb n="54" facs="tcp:49801:30"/>
            <p>I have thus (as I think) clear'd the Difficulty which ariſeth from our
finding the Precepts of Faith and Repentance, ſo frequently enjoin'd in the
New Teſtament, and have demonſtrated that all ſuch Inſtances will not ſerve
the Purpoſe of evincing the Goſpel to be a new Law. The next Rank of
Arguments to be broken is this, that it is alledg'd that the Goſpel denounceth
Threatnings againſt unbelieving and impenitent Sinners, and makes general
Promiſes, that every one who believes and repents, in obedience to its Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
ſhall certainly be ſav'd. If I now then prove that theſe Threatnings
are not of the Goſpel, but that it only leaves the Sinner, who by Faith hath
no Intereſt in Chriſt, to the condemning Sentence of the Law, without any
Defence or Plea, or the leaſt Excuſe for himſelf: And if I alſo prove, that the
Goſpel makes no ſuch univerſal Promiſes of Eternal Life to all Men, on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
they believe, I ſhall then clear the Way through my Reverend Brother's
firſt thick Set of Arguments, form'd from twenty Texts of Scripture enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
by him.</p>
            <p>One plain Text of Scripture evinceth, that the Goſpel judgeth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth
no Man, but leaves the unbelieving Sinner to a fair Trial at Law, and
to make the beſt of it that he can. 'Tis what Chriſt, who came to ſave
Sinners, and perfectly knew his own Deſign and Work, tells us, <hi>John</hi> 3. 17.
<hi>For God ſent not his Son into the World to condemn the World; but that the
World through him might be ſaved.</hi> What could he have ſaid more to aſſure
us, that in the Declaration of the Goſpel he did not threaten Death, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
Salvation to Sinners, whom the Law menac'd, and who were condemn'd
by its Sentence; that he came not as a new Legiſlator, to give new Laws,
and to pronounce a fatal Doom againſt thoſe that diſobey'd them, but to reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue
poor ſentenc'd Criminals from the rigorous Judgment of the Law, and to
aſſure them of a Pardon? He came not to condemn the World, but to ſave all
thoſe whom God had appointed to Life, and conſequently to believe on him.
But if Chriſt had brought in a new Law, with Precepts and Threatnings,
then one Deſign of his coming had been to condemn the Diſobedient. Our
Bleſſed Redeemer took an effectual Care that we ſhould not have ſuch a
Thought of him; and therefore he repeats the ſame Aſſertion, <hi>John</hi> 12.
47. <hi>And if any Man hear my Words, and believe not, I judg him not; for I
came not to judg the World, but to ſave the World.</hi> He doth not threaten,
much leſs judg and condemn an Unbeliever: He knew that Salvation of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
was the Work which he came into the World to perform, and that the
Office of a Judg did not belong to a Mediator. He accordingly diſowns it, and
leaves to the Law its proper Duty, which is to paſs Sentence of Death on eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Sinner, who cannot plead the Blood and Righteouſneſs of Chriſt for his
Diſcharge; and this all Unbelievers dying in that woful Condition are unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
to do. Thus the Goſpel condemns no Man, but it is the Law; and
thoſe who believe not, ſhall be judg'd by it, for violating its juſt and righteous
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:49801:30"/>
Commands, and are expos'd defenſleſs and liable to Juſtice. Thoſe who
believe not on Chriſt, are preſently condemned by the old Law in force againſt
them who have in the leaſt Inſtance diſobey'd it; and there is no need that
any Sentence of a new Law ſhould be paſs'd againſt them to this Effect. If any
ſhould deny the Argument, I am yet confident they will have a regard to the
expreſs Words of Chriſt himſelf, which are to the ſame Pupoſe, <hi>John</hi> 3. 18.
<hi>He that believeth on him, is not condemned; but he that believeth not, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
already, becauſe he hath not believed in the Name of the only begotten
Son of God.</hi> What is this but to ſay, that he introduced no new Law to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
the wretched and deſperately loſt Sinner for not believing on him, ſince
he was before condemned for the Offences committed againſt the Moral Law?
But it will be urg'd, What is more frequently pronounc'd by Chriſt and his
Apoſtles, againſt all Unbelievers, than an unavoidable Ruin and Damnation?
ſuch Threatnings are almoſt as thickly ſcatter'd in the New Teſtament, as the
Promiſes of Grace. What then! will it thence follow that the Goſpel,
which is a Doctrine of Grace, is alſo a dreadful threatning Law? No certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
for theſe two are altogether inconſiſtent. All then which can be conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
is only this, that the Goſpel repeats the Threatnings of the Law, to ſhew
Sinners their Danger if they do not believe. This Goſpel only tells them
what ſevere Meaſure they will have from a violated Law, if they are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clos'd
within the compaſs of the Mediator's Favour and Bleſſings. It plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and ſincerely declares to them, that they can expect nothing but certain
Death from a Law which kills the Sinner, if they refuſe the only healing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
which Chriſt offers. Thus it is told to a Patient, That he will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
die, if he takes not the preſcrib'd Phyſick: And yet who will ſay that
this Threatning is any part of the Medicine? Thus the Phyſician pronounceth
Death to a Man, who when mortally Sick, wilfully refuſeth to obſerve his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections.
And how abſurd is it from this to imagine, that he who came to
cure, deſign'd to murder him, when it is only the Diſeaſe, and his own Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy,
which have this fatal Effect?</p>
            <p>'Tis true indeed, that an Unbeliever's Guilt is aggravated by his Contempt
of the Goſpel; and by rejecting Mercy, and deſpiſing the Riches of God's
Grace, he lays himſelf open to a ſeverer Sentence, brings an heavier Ruin on
his Head, and ſharpens his own Puniſhment. For as the Fire of Hell is the
Wrath of God, and the avenging Furies of Conſcience, thoſe Flames will burn
with more fierceneſs in a Soul, which makes terrible Reflections how while it
lived in this World, it ſlighted that Grace and that Redeemer, by which others
were ſaved. Thus a Pardon offer'd to Rebels, doth not condemn them for not
accepting it; the Refuſal only leaves them expos'd to the Severity of the
Law, by which the unpardon'd Offender is judg'd and condemn'd: Tho in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the Criminal recalling to mind the Pardon once offer'd him, and his own
obſtinate Contempt of Mercy, will, with greater Horrors of Soul, at the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:49801:31"/>
Place of Execution, curſe his own Folly and Madneſs, as the Cauſe of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous
Death.</p>
            <p>There now remains nothing more than to ſhew, that the Promiſes of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Life made to the Believer, and the Ruin denounc'd againſt every Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever,
do not prove the Goſpel to be a new Law; and that ſuch Expreſſions
as theſe, which we ſo often meet, <hi>He who believes ſhall be ſav'd; and except
you repent, you ſhall all likewiſe periſh,</hi> do not ſpeak Faith and Repentance to
be properly commanded by the Goſpel, nor promiſes Pardon and Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
on condition theſe Precepts are obey'd, nor threatens Death if they
are neglected. That it is not the Goſpel, but the Law which threatens
Death, I have already proved; that the Promiſes of the Goſpel are not made
unto Men, on condition of Obedience perform'd to it, is evident from this,
that if they were ſo, they would not differ in their Nature from the Promiſes
of the Law, and ſo the Covenant of Grace would be a Covenant of Works:
which if the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſays true, (as I really believe he doth) is a flat
Contradiction, <hi>Rom. 11. 6. And if by Grace, then is it no more of Works:
otherwiſe Grace is no more Grace. But if it be of Works, then is it no more
Grace; otherwiſe Work is no more Work.</hi> For the Promiſes of the Law were
made to Men, on condition that its Precepts were obey'd. If now the Promiſes
of the Goſpel are alſo made to Men, on condition that its Precepts are obey'd,
then the Promiſes, both of the one and the other, are of the ſame Nature and
King, being both made to Obedience. It is but a poor ſhifting Evaſion, to
ſay, that there is a great difference, becauſe that the Law requires perfect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinning
Obedience, and the Goſpel inſiſts only on lower degrees of Duty: for
this will not ſo much as prove the Obedience to be of different Kinds, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of greater or leſſer Meaſures, which, as every one knows, doth not alter the
Species. But if it ſhould be granted, that Obedience to the Law is of a vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Nature from that enjoin'd by the Goſpel, yet the Promiſes made to them
both muſt be of the ſame Kind, for both of them are Works: ſince to obey a
Precept, is to do a Work, or I know not what to make of it; and all the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
then is, that the Promiſes of the Covenant of Works were made
to Obedience to the old Law, and the Promiſes of the new Covenant of
Grace were made to Obedience unto the new Law. Both are Promiſes to the
Obedience of Laws, and the two Laws will be diſtinguiſhed no otherwiſe,
than that the one proves to be older than the other by many Ages. And thus
the Goſpel will be only the ſuperannuated Law of Works reviv'd, with ſome
Abatements of its requir'd Duties. And if this be not as utterly falſe as
there is Truth in the Scriptures, (as I am ſure there is) let all unprejudic'd
Men judg. And yet this abſurd Confuſion of Law and Goſpel, is the unavoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
Conſequence of this Annertion, that the Goſpel promiſes Juſtification and
Eternal Life to Men, on condition they perform the Obedience which it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
            <pb n="57" facs="tcp:49801:31"/>
            <p>If alſo from this Propoſition, <hi>He that believeth ſhall be ſaved,</hi> we argue
that the Goſpel is a new Law, promiſing Life upon the obſervance of this its
Precept, it will follow, that God in the promulgation of this new Law, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
Life univerſally to all Men, to Tartars, Negroes, and the Savages in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica;</hi>
to all the Nations from <hi>Peru</hi> to <hi>Japan,</hi> on condition they obey the
Command of the Goſpel, and believe and repent: For if God in giving his
Moral Law to all reaſonable Creatures, ſaid univerſally to Angels and Men,
<hi>Do this, and you ſhall live;</hi> by the ſame Rule, if the Goſpel is a new Law, God
ſpeaks generally to all Men, <hi>Believe, and you ſhall live.</hi> Now from this, two
amazing Abſurdities will naturally ſpring; the one is, that God ſhould by this
his new Law promiſe Pardon and Life, on condition they believe on his Son, to
People who have never heard that there is ſuch a thing as the Chriſtian Religion
in the World, nor ſuch a Perſon as Chriſt, and to whoſe Ears not ſo much as
the ſound of his Name ever arriv'd. Doth this become the Wiſdom of God
to act ſo prepoſterouſly? How can we think that the <hi>Depths of that Knowledg,</hi>
as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 33. hath ſuch ſhallow Deſigns, as to proclaim
a Pardon to all Men, on condition they believe, and yet to make no Proviſion
that the leaſt Syllable of this gracious Proclamation ſhould ever come to their
Ears? It is alſo as repugnant to the Wiſdom and Goodneſs of God, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
a Pardon to all Men, on condition they believe, when he knows that the
Performance is impoſſible to them all, by their mere natural Powers deprav'd as
they are; when he knows alſo, that without his All-conquering Grace they
cannot believe and repent: To promiſe to them all Life, on condition they
do ſo, and at the ſame time to reſolve to withhold this Grace from the greateſt
part of Mankind, without which it is impoſſible for them to do it, what is
this but to illude Men? For any one to offer Food to a Wretch, who hath not
a Limb whole, ſtarving in a Dungeon, on condition that he would come up
and receive it, and yet refuſe to put forth a Finger to give him the leaſt lift,
what would this be but to mock him, and to make a ſport of his Miſery?
To avoid theſe Abſurdities, the Arminians, who do not want Wit or Reaſon
to diſcern the Conſequences of their Opinions, as boldly own and maintain
them: And as they aſſert, that God offers and promiſeth Life to all, on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
they perform Obedience to this new Law; they ſpeak conſiſtently with
themſelves, and affirm too, that all Men have ſufficient Means afforded them
to do it, and that God gives them Helps enough to enable them to believe
if they will, and whenever themſelves pleaſe. If we are then fond of any
Arminian Opinions, we muſt take the whole Syſtem of them together,
and aſſert roundly, as they do, without mincing the Matter, what hath an
inſeparable Connexion with a falſe Propoſition: for there are Conſequences
among Errors, as well as Truths; and as the one are chain'd, the other are
link'd together.</p>
            <pb n="58" facs="tcp:49801:32"/>
            <p>We may then be certain, that theſe Expreſſions in Scripture, [<hi>He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth,
ſhall be ſav'd; but he that believeth not, ſhall be damn'd,</hi> Mark
16. 16. And <hi>whoever believeth on Chriſt, ſhall receive remiſſion of Sins,</hi>
Acts 10. 43. <hi>And except you repent, you ſhall all likewiſe periſh,</hi> Luke 13.
5.] which are urg'd by my Reverend Brother<note n="a" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Lorimer'<hi>s Apology,</hi> Chap. 2. Sect. 1. pag. 22.</note>, do not ſignify that
God paſſeth his Word to all Men, by a new Law eſtabliſh'd among them,
that if they obey it, and believe and repent, they ſhall aſſuredly be ſaved:
for God always ſpeaks the Purpoſes of his Mind, and none of his Words
contradict his Heart; but he never decreed, either abſolutely or conditionally,
that all Men ſhould be eternally happy; for if he had, he would have taken
effectual Care that they ſhould be ſo, ſince the Intents of his Mind and Will
always obtain infallibly their deſir'd Effect.</p>
            <p>If we alſo underſtand that Expreſſion, <hi>He who believes, ſhall be ſav'd,</hi> that
it is promis'd to all, that on the performance of this Condition they ſhall be
thus eternally bleſs'd; then by the ſame Rule we muſt ſay, that eternal Death
and Ruin is threaten'd to them, on condition they do not believe. But the
Threatnings of this Wo are not denounc'd againſt Men for not believing,
but as due to them for not perfectly obeying the Law of Works; and their
Unbelief only leaves them in that periſhing Condition wherein they were
born, as I have prov'd before, tho, as I ſaid, their Unbelief aggravates the
Miſery, and inflames the Anguiſh of it.</p>
            <p>But what meaning then muſt we apprehend theſe Scriptures to bear? Why
truly they have the ſame Senſe as that Text in <hi>Heb. 12. 14. Follow Peace with
all Men, and Holineſs, without which no Man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi> What!
is Holineſs the Condition of obtaining the Beatifical Viſion? No; tho it doth
naturally diſpoſe the Soul, and make it meet for and capable of this bliſsful En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment.
No more therefore is meant, than that Holineſs, and this Viſion of
God, are inſeparably join'd together, and that no unholy Soul can poſſibly come
to his Preſence and Sight. Thus it is alſo true, that <hi>he who believes, ſhall be
ſav'd;</hi> which imports no more than this, that all Believers are ſav'd, and
none but they; and that there is ſuch an unchangeable Connexion between
the Bleſſings of the Goſpel, that Faith, Repentance and Holineſs, are indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolubly
faſten'd with Pardon, Juſtification, and Eternal Life, in the ſame Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
or in a Word, that God juſtifies and ſaves no Man, but whom at his own
due appointed Time he makes a Believer, brings him to Repentance, (I
ſpeak in this of Adult Perſons) and ſanctifies his Nature: and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
aſſerts this, is no Antinomian, nor ſo much as like to ſuch an exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable
Monſter, however invidious Names are flung about as thick as Stones
in the Streets.</p>
            <pb n="59" facs="tcp:49801:32"/>
            <p>I might inſiſt more largely on this Argument, but I begin to think that
the Conſideration of it will more properly belong to another Diſcourſe,
wherein I deſign, with the Aſſiſtance of my Lord Jeſus Chriſt, (who hath
help'd me in this, beyond the natural Abilities of my own Mind, to him be
all the Glory) to prove, that the Covenant of Grace doth not promiſe nor
confer the Bleſſings on condition of performing Duties requir'd.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>Thoſe Texts of Scripture (which are urg'd by the Apologiſt, as expreſly giving
the Name of a New Law to the Goſpel) recover'd to their right Senſe.
His Teſtimonies out of the Fathers, and Proteſtant Writers, evinc'd to be
uſeleſs to ſerve his Deſign.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>I Shall now examine thoſe Texts alledg'd by my Dear Brother, wherein the
Goſpel is call'd a <hi>Law;</hi> and the Citations produc'd by him, wherein the
Fathers and Proteſtant Authors give to it the ſame Name. I ſhall do it but
briefly, for I need not be large, ſince any Reader who hath, with any inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Mind, perus'd my poor Writing, may reſolve them all at firſt ſight.</p>
            <p>The firſt Text produc'd is, that known one in <hi>Rom. 3. 27. Where is boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then? It is excluded. By what Law? of Works? Nay, but by the Law
of Faith.</hi> Without looking on the Context, we may be ſatisfied by what the
Apoſtle ſaith in the ſame Verſe, that by the Law of Faith, he means no more
than that Doctrine of Grace which declares a believing Sinner to be juſtified
by the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, which by Faith he receiveth; for it is ſuch a
Law of Faith that excludes all boaſting. Now then, if it commanded
Faith, and promis'd Juſtification, on condition that this its Precept was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey'd,
Boaſting would not be excluded, but rather a great Occaſion would be
given to promote it: For why ſhould not a Man glory in his Faith, if it be
an Act of Obedience to this new Law, which by the Statute of it makes his
Juſtification to depend on this his Performance? He may then as well plead
that he hath done what was requir'd; and ſo he may as well claim Life and
Happineſs, on the Account of having done all that this new Law made neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to Salvation; as <hi>Adam,</hi> if continuing in his Primitive State, might have
form'd a Plea of his Right to Life, for having diſcharg'd all that Duty which
the Law of Works commanded and propos'd, as the Condition of his being
eternally Bleſſed. If he might have boaſted for having faithfully obſerv'd the
Covenant of Works, the Believer too may aſſume ſome Glory to himſelf
for having acted his Duty punctually to the Law of Faith; if the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this Law be ſuch, that it makes the promis'd Salvation dependant up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this his Obedience in believing. It will ſignify nothing to ſay, that the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:49801:33"/>
Law by which <hi>Adam</hi> was to have been juſtified, enjoin'd Works as the Terms
of his being ſo; but that this new Law inſiſts only on two Acts of Obedience,
Faith and Repentance, as all that it requires for our Juſtification: For theſe
two are Works done by us, and ſo we might boaſt that we have done ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
tho not ariſing to that height of Duty incumbent on our firſt Father;
by which, according to the Tenor of this new Law, we are juſtified. By the
Oppoſition which the Apoſtle makes of the Law of Faith to a Law of
Works, it is alſo manifeſt, that by the firſt he intends a pure Doctrine of
Grace, and by the other a Law, commanding ſomething to be done: For if
the Law of Faith requires any Works, and conſtituted them to be Conditions
of our obtaining the Bleſſings; make theſe Works as few as you will, and
call them by what Names you pleaſe, <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> yet this will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
from it, that both are Laws of Works; only with this difference, that the
one rigorouſly inſiſts on more Works than the other: which how this may
conſiſt with that Oppoſition the Apoſtle forms between them, I cannot very
well apprehend.</p>
            <p>We muſt therefore by the Law of Faith underſtand, not a Law in the ſtrict
and proper Senſe, preſcribing Works of any ſort as Conditions, but only the
Doctrine of Faith, and of the Believer's Juſtification by Chriſt's Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
which Faith receives. It is thus all the right Proteſtant Divines, who
have commented on this Epiſtle, interpret the Apoſtle's meaning; tho the
Popiſh Annotators wreſt it to the ſame Purpoſe for which it is brought in by
my Reverend Brother, as I ſhall prove by many Inſtances.</p>

Contzen.</hi> This laſt orders his Commentary on the Epiſtle to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
in a way of Diſputation, to refute the Hereticks, as he calls all thoſe
who believe the pure Truths of the Goſpel. One great Doctrine of theſe No-Hereticks
is, that the Goſpel is no Law. This ſuppos'd Error the Jeſuit ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
himſelf to confute; and in reſolving that Queſtion, What is the Law of
Works? and what the Law of Faith? he firſt propounds <hi>Bellarmine</hi>'s De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion
of it; the Sum whereof is, that the Goſpel is a Law of Works too,
but accompanied with Grace. But there is an Objection of <hi>Paraeus</hi> in the
way, That if the Goſpel be a Law, as containing in it Precepts and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
then the Diſtinction which the Apoſtle makes between the Law of
Faith, and Law of Works, cannot be preſerv'd; for both of them will agree
in commanding Works, however different thoſe Works may be which they
enjoin, and therefore they both of them muſt neceſſarily be Laws of Works;
unleſs any one will be ſo accurate a Diſputant, as to deny a Law to be a Law,
or Works to be Works. To remove this Objection, <hi>Contzen,</hi> (who being a
Jeſuit, was very well skill'd in all the Arts of Shuffling as well as any Man,
and knew the neceſſary Doubles and Turnings when he was hunted) like a
Politician in Divinity, makes this evaſive Anſwer; <hi>That both Laws command,
and yet the Law of Faith is not a Law of Works, though it commands Works;
becauſe it hath the Aids of Grace, by which the Works are perform'd. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Law of Faith is a Law of Grace, the Law of Works is without Grace.</hi>
This is ſtrange indeed; What! the Goſpel commands, and yet is not a Law of
Works; that is, the Goſpel commands, without bidding us to do any thing;
or to do, is not to work, but I know not what without a Name. Ay, but it
is not a Law of Works, becauſe it contains in it Grace, as a ſupply of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
to enable us to perform them. But this only proves the Works of their
new Goſpel to be eaſier, not that they are none at all. The beſt which can
be made of it amounts to no more than this, that their Goſpel is a gracious
Law of Works, a Law whoſe Exactions are not ſo hard and cruel as thoſe of
the Tyrannical Egyptians, to require Brick without Straw, a Law whoſe
Commands are moderated, and its leſſer degrees of Duty accommodated to
the weakneſs of our preſent State; and therefore it is not all Work, bu there is
an Alloy of a great mixture of Grace. This ſeems to be fairly offer'd to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
the Buſineſs: but what if the Apoſtle refuſeth the Compoſition? And
indeed, in my poor Judgment, (if a Man may know his Meaning by his
Words) it will not be admitted by him; for he oppoſeth the Goſpel, or Law
of Faith, to any Law of Works whatever, and however named <hi>gracious,</hi>
or rendred attractive by any other amiable Titles.</p>
            <p>But in the Cloſe of the Diſpute, this Jeſuit <hi>Contzen</hi> joyfully cries out, <hi>Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi>
And what animated his Courage? Really it was only this, that he thought
any more of his Learned Labours in this Affair were wholly ſuperſeded, by a
great many of the Proteſtants owning the ſame Aſſertion (which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:49801:34"/>
to prove) of the Goſpel's being a new Law. But what are the
Trophies of Conqueſt which he ſhews to this purpoſe? only <hi>Bertius</hi> the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minian,

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:49801:34"/>
no more effectual to prove his Aſſertion than any of the former: The whole
Verſe is thus, <hi>Iſa. 42. 4. He ſhall not fail, nor be diſcouraged, till he have ſet
Judgment in the Earth: and the Iſles ſhall wait for his Law.</hi> That by his
Law is meant a Declaration of Free Grace, is apparent from the genuine Senſe
of the Hebrew word, which in our Engliſh Bibles is tranſlated, [<hi>they ſhall wait

Language, renders it. We may then by a neceſſary Conſequence conclude,
that by Law here is meant, a publication of Free Grace by Chriſt, ſince the
poor Sinners of the Gentiles could not deſire or hope for any other. But
without any Criticiſms on the Hebrew Language, the foregoing Verſe of the
Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> inſtructs us to a right underſtanding of the following, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.
3. <hi>A bruiſed Reed ſhall he not break; and the ſmoking Flax ſhall he not
quench: he ſhall bring forth Judgment unto Truth.</hi> Now if Chriſt had
brought in a new Law, with Precepts ſuperadded to the old One, this would
have been to break the bruis'd Soul with repeated Strokes in greater ſtrength
and fierceneſs.</p>
            <p>There is another Scripture produc'd by my Learned Brother to be examin'd,
which he urgeth to prove, That the Goſpel as a new Law promiſeth Bleſſings
to the Performers of its Precepts, and threatens to puniſh all thoſe who
neglect them; <hi>Luke 19. 27. But thoſe mine Enemies which would not that I
ſhould reign over them, bring hither, and ſlay them before me.</hi> Now as I think,
who am very willing to be better inform'd, our bleſſed Lord Jeſus aſſerts on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
his Right as Univerſal Monarch of the World; which we are ſo far from
denying, that we heartily pray that his Kingdom may come in all the Shine
of its Glory, as we are ſure it will at the determin'd Time.</p>
            <p>Well, but to ſoften the harſh word <hi>Law,</hi> he adds the more allaying one of
<hi>Grace.</hi> But this will not do the Buſineſs, for a Law preſcribing Works is no
Covenant of Grace, if it be true what the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>Rom. 11. 6. And if
by Grace, then is it no more of Works: otherwiſe Grace is no more Grace. But
if it be of Works, then is it no more Grace: otherwiſe Work is no more Work.</hi>
Therefore his no angry Brethren, are in no Paſſion to hear the Voice of the
Law, if the old Moral One, as a continuing Rule to Believers, is meant;
and they are very glad of the joyful Sound of Grace, they only gaze and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
at the ſtrange Prodigy of thoſe two unnaturally join'd together, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
a Covenant of Grace.</p>
            <p>And tho with the greateſt rejoicing we moſt thankfully accept God's new
Covenant of Grace, yet we cannot own a new Law of his making, till we
hear it more clearly proclaim'd by God himſelf.</p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs I was a little ſurpriz'd at what I next read in my Reverend
Brother's Learned Diſcourſe; <hi>The Law of Grace we ſpeak of,</hi> (ſays he) <hi>is
both New and Old in different reſpects: It is New in reſpect of the Covenant
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:49801:35"/>
of Works made with</hi> Adam <hi>in his State of Innocency</hi>
               <note n="a" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Lorimer<hi>'s Apology,</hi> Chap. 2. Sect. 1. pag. 22.</note>. What! is it a new
Law of a freſher Date, that the old One being uſeleſs, God ſaw it needful to
promulgate another, lower'd to leſſer degrees of Duty, and ſo ſuted to the
preſent Eſtate of Sinners? I am confident my Learned Brother will not aſſert
this, tho it unhappily falls out that his Words ſeem to imply it<note n="b" place="bottom">Ibid. pag. 24.</note>.</p>
            <p>There remains nothing more than to examine his Humane Authorities;
which I will do, tho there is the greateſt uncertainty in the Citation of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
to abet an Opinion, when Men only take care and labour to wrack and
torture them to a forced Confeſſion of their own Senſe: For if the Words of
the Holy Ghoſt himſelf, who deliver'd his Meaning moſt diſtinctly, and with
the greateſt exactneſs, are yet wreſted and perverted to contrary Purpoſes, all
Humane Writings are much more liable to be disfigur'd by wrong Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>I will yet conſider in order the ſeveral Authorities alledg'd; and firſt as
to that of <hi>Juſtin Martyr.</hi> Any one who diſtinctly regards the Deſign of that
Father's Writing, will ſee, that however he makes uſe of the word <hi>Law,</hi> by
which to name the Goſpel, yet by Law he means no more, than a new Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
or Diſpenſation of Grace. For his Deſign is to prove, againſt a Jew
who was a great Admirer of his own Law, and its auguſt Ceremonies and
Worſhip, That all that ſolemn Pomp was excelled by the plain Evangelical
Doctrine; that this new Diſcovery of the Bleſſings of Grace in the real and
ſolid Subſtance, was infinitely preferable to all the old Repreſentations and
Shadows of thoſe good Things: And therefore by this new Law, or this new
Inſtruction of Grace coming, thoſe old Rudiments go off as uſeleſs to teach
us any longer. The Goſpel as a new Doctrine of Grace appearing, the old
Inſtitutions of Sacrifices and External Rites, civilly are to withdraw, to give
place to a ſuperiour and better Inſtructor. To prove this is the Deſign of that
Father's Dialogue againſt the Jew; and all that can be gather'd from his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the Goſpel a <hi>New Law,</hi> is only this, that it is a fuller and clearer Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Grace of God in Chriſt, as is evident from what follows a little
after thoſe Words cited by my Learned Brother, where <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
his Meaning about the Goſpel's being a New Law,<note n="c" place="bottom">

                  </gap>. Juſt. Mart. Dial. cum Tryph. pag. 229. oper. Edit. <hi>Pariſ.</hi> 1636.</note> that it is ſo as it
is a new and clearer Diſpenſation of Grace: for having cited that Place in <hi>Iſa.</hi>
55. 3, 4. expreſſing the Nature of the Goſpel, and upbraiding the Jew for
his Confidence in old Legal Performances, in Circumciſion, in eating unlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened
Bread, in waſhing in the Laver of Water, in the Blood of Sheep and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:49801:35"/>
Goats, and the Aſhes of an Heifer; It is not by theſe, ſays he, that Sinners are
purified, but by the Blood of Chriſt, and his Death; who died for that very
Purpoſe, as <hi>Eſa</hi> himſelf hath ſpoketh it. And then he largely recites the ſix 
laſt Verſes of the <hi>52d</hi> Chapter, and Chap. 53. entire, and the ſix firſt Verſes of
the <hi>54th</hi> Chapter of that Prophet; which contain the moſt clear and full Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of the Doctrine of Grace, as is in all the old Teſtament. So that all
which the Father intends by the Name of a <hi>new Law</hi> given to the Goſpel, is,
that it is a Doctrine of Grace newly revealed: And in this Senſe, I am very
willing to call it ſo too.</p>
            <p>But let us ſee if <hi>Cyprian</hi> gives his Vote for my Learned Brother. It is true,
that he ſpeaks frequently in his <hi>11th</hi> Epiſtle of the Law of the Goſpel; but it
is certain, that as he wrote this Epiſtle to complain of, and to rectify the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation
of Diſcipline in the Churches, that thoſe who had fallen into great,
and notorious Sins, were yet re-admitted into Communion before they had
given any Teſtimony of their Repentance; ſo by the Law of the Goſpel he
means only that due Diſcipline, which ought to be obſerved in all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of Chriſt<note n="a" place="bottom">Goulartii notae in Cyprian. Epiſt. 11. pag. 33. oper. Cyprian. Edit. Goulartii, <hi>Genev.</hi> 1593.</note>.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Cyprian</hi> alſo ſpeaks of a new Law which was to be given, he writing
againſt the Jews, and proving the Abolition of their Ceremonial Worſhip,
means no more by the new Law than what <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> did; that is, a new
Doctrine, and Inſtitution of Grace: And this the very words of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by my Learned Brother, wherein he calls this new Law, <hi>Another Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration,
and that by it the old intolerable Yoke of Ligal Obſervances was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd,</hi>
do evidence.</p>
            <p>The next Father, who is forc'd to come in to give witneſs to this new
Law, is <hi>Auguſtine:</hi> But what he ſays will not at all ſerve the Cauſe. For in
that his Diſcourſe of Grace and Free-will, his Deſign is to prove againſt the
Pelagians, that Man by the beſt uſe of his natural Powers, cannot obey the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
of the Moral Law; but that the Grace of the Goſpel is abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to ſtrengthen a Chriſtian to that Obedience which be pays; tho imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly,
to the old Law as the Rule of his Actions. And that great Light of his
Age makes the Difference between the new and old Law to be this that
the old Law conſiſted wholly in Precepts and Commands, and ſo was a killing
Letter to the Sinner; but the Nature of the Goſpel is to promiſe, and give
Grace:<note n="b" place="bottom">Cum dicitur diligamus invicem, Lex eſt; cum dicitur quia dilectio ex Deo eſt. Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia eſt. Auguſtin. de Gratia &amp; Libero arbitrio, cap. 18. fol. 284. pag. 2. Tom. 7. oper. <hi>Paris.</hi> 1571.</note> 
               <hi>When it is ſaid,</hi> (ſays he) 1 Joh. 4. 7. <hi>Let us love one another;
this is Law: when it is ſaid, Becauſe Love is of God, this is Grace.</hi> He aſſerts
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:49801:36"/>
that there are Precepts in the New Teſtament, and none ever had ſo little Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
as to deny it; but theſe Precepts do not properly belong to the
pure Nature of the Goſpel, but are only repeated and urg'd in it: but it is
that Grace which promiſes Pardon to the Sinner, and that Grace which makes
the Believer holy and obedient, that are the native Streams which are deriv'd
from this Spring. And it is apparent from the Words of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> cited by
my Reverend Brother, that this Father makes the old Law to be a Doctrine of
Works, and <hi>ſo a killing Letter without Grace;</hi> that is, without the Goſpel,
which as a pure Doctrine of Grace, ſhews how the Law is ſatisfied by Chriſt,
and how the Sinner and the Ungodly may be juſtified; and affords Supplies
of Grace ſutable to all the various Needs of the Believer. The other Place
cited out of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> proves no more than that we are freed from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
of the Law by the Law of Faith, which how it is to be underſtood
of the Doctrine of Faith, I have before ſhewn in reſouing <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 27. from its
perverted Meaning, Page 59. of this Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Salvian</hi>'s Teſtimony proves no more than that the Chriſtian Law, or the
Doctrine of Grace, was diſhonour'd by ſome Mens abuſing it to Licentiouſneſs.
<hi>Bradwardine</hi> I muſt confeſs ſpeaks plainly to my Reverend Brother's Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
but it is no wonder: for tho with incomparable Strength, and Cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Reaſon, he refuted the Pelagian Hereſies, yet he was a Papiſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
firm to the Belief of the Roman Creed, the principal Article of
which is Merit. He accordingly, tho utterly diſclaiming Works done by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
yet aſſerts Works done by Grace to be meritorious. To ſupport this Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion,
the Writers of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> have taken care to lay down ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as its main Foundation, that the Goſpel is a new Law; and therefore by
obeying of the Precepts of it, which are made the Conditions, we deſervedly
(as they aſſert) obtain, by virtue of God's Covenant ſtipulated with us on
ſuch Terms, the promiſed Rewards. <hi>Bradwardine</hi> accordingly maintains the
Goſpel to be a new Law, and that <hi>whoever ſhall keep this Chriſtian Law, ſhall
receive eternal Glory.</hi>

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Lorimer<hi>'s Apology,</hi> pag. 26.</note> So that this Man's Authority in the preſent Caſe
(however great and excellent he is in other Points) will not reflect any Glory
on this Hypotheſis; but rather doth diſparage it, ſince it evinceth how near
this Opinion of the Goſpel's being a new Law, approacheth to Popery, tho I
cannot entertain a thought, that any of my Reverend Brethren do deſignedly
make the leaſt advancing ſtep to it.</p>
            <p>As to the Teſtimony of the <hi>Leyden</hi> Profeſſors, they only mean that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
in a large and improper Senſe may be term'd a Law, becauſe there are
Precepts, Commands, and Threatnings in the Books of the New Teſtament.
But thoſe worthy Profeſſors, when they treat of the Goſpel in its ſtrict Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:49801:36"/>
they define it to be only a pure Word of Grace. For, ſays <hi>Polyander,</hi>

of the Divine Mercy in Conjunction with Juſtice:</hi> 1 Cor. 9. 14, 15. This is in
the ſame Diſputation cited by my Brother. And a little after the ſame Learned
<hi>Polyander</hi> renounceth the Opinion of the Schoolmen and Monks, aſſerting the
Goſpel to be a new Law; and diſclaims the Arminian and Socinian Doctrines,
which attribute to the Goſpel as a new Law, new Precepts that are proper and
peculiar to it. Whether then theſe Reverend Profeſſors ever once thought the
Goſpel, ſtrictly and properly taken, to be a Law, let any one judg.</p>
            <p>It is eaſy alſo to judg, that <hi>Gomarus</hi> underſtands the Goſpel in its larger Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation,
when he calls it a Law in the Place cited by my Reverend Brother;
for when before in the ſame Diſputation he defines the Goſpel, (and then to
be ſure he took it in its ſtrict and proper Senſe) he makes not the leaſt mention
of a Law, nor of Commands of Threatnings<note n="b" place="bottom">Gomar. Diſput. 15. Theſ. 25. pag. 52. Tom. 8. 3. oper. <hi>Amſtel.</hi> 1644.</note>: As I have before given the
Inſtance from his own words, Page 34. of this Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>It is weariſome to follow my Learned Brother through all his Citations, and
particularly to conſider them; there is no need to do it largely: and tho what
he tranſcribes out of Dr. <hi>Twiſs</hi> takes up almoſt three Pages, yet a ſhort Anſwer
will take off this Teſtimony too, and ſhew that it is nothing to the Purpoſe.
In a word, all that can be concluded from the Words of Dr. <hi>Twiſs</hi> is only
this, that God hath appointed a ſet and ſtated Order in our Salvation, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to which he proceeds. As he is not a God of Confuſion, he ſaves us regular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and beſtows his Bleſſings in a due Series; ſo that in a becoming Manner
one may follow the other: And how the Goſpel is ſuch a regular Order and
Harmony of Bleſſings, I have ſhewed before, Page 6. of this Diſcourſe.</p>
            <pb n="68" facs="tcp:49801:37"/>
            <p>And by this Way we may ſoberly and ſincerely deal with a poor dying Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
(to whom my Reverend Brother<note n="a" place="bottom">Apology, <hi>pag.</hi> 32, 33.</note> next brings me) without encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
his Preſumption in the general Notions which even wicked Men have of
God's being merciful, and Chriſt's dying for Sinners; or throwing him into
the Convulſions of Deſpair. If I ſhould tell him juſt dying, of a new Law which
muſt be obey'd by him, before he can entertain any hopes; that this new
Law requires Obedience from him, and till he hath done it, he muſt look
for nothing but Condemnation from its ſevere Sentence: If I tell him that one
Condition of this Law is that he reform the Courſe of a Life, of which he is
come within a point of the Period; and that unleſs he live better he cannot be
ſaved, when he hath but a few Moments longer to live: He would certainly
look very ghaſtly upon me, and think that I made his <hi>Mittimus</hi> to Hell. But
if I tell him, that the Bleſſings of the Covenant are inſeparable, and where
God gives one, they are followed with all the other; That where God confers
his Favour, he plants Grace too, and works Faith in the Heart of thoſe whom
he hath decreed to ſave: That this Faith, if true, is accompanied with Love;
and the natural Product of that is a ſincere Reſolution to pleaſe Chriſt, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
him; and if he can lay his Hand on his Heart, and find theſe Bleſſings
there, he may be aſſured of his Intereſt in the other, and that believing he is
juſtified by the Obedience of Chriſt to the Law performed for him. This
Declaration of the Goſpel to a ſtartled Sinner, who hath not one Minute longer
to promiſe to his affrighted Spirit, may (God making it the Power of God
unto Salvation) revive, and give new Life unto-him in the Agonies of Death.
But to amaze him with a Diſcourſe of new Laws, and Commands, and Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
would be to ſtab him to the Soul, and to murder him more cruelly
than his Diſeaſe.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>That this Opinion of the Goſpel's being a New Law, too much agrees with the

            </argument>
            <p>SINCE Popery and Arminianiſm, under various Names, and in purſuit
of different Ends, make the ſame ſtated Oppoſition to the Deſign of the
Goſpel; every Opinion which agrees with their Errors, deſerves to be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiciouſly
regarded, and is unworthy of any favourable reception. If it then
doth appear that this Doctrine of the Goſpel's being a new Law, hath been
ſtrongly maintain'd by the Romiſh Church in ſeveral Ages, as that which lays
the ſureſt Foundation for that dear Article of their Faith, the Merit of Works;
and hath all been zealouſly eſpouſed by the Arminians and Socinians, as a moſt
effectual Engine to overthrow Juſtification by the imputed Righteouſneſs of
Chriſt: Then all who love Jeſus the Redeemer, or are careful of their own
Salvation by him, will be very wary of giving a welcome Entertainment to
this new Law. That the Doctors of the Romiſh Church have all along aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted

               <q>1. The Evangelical Law, if its pure Inſtructions and Commands, and
Subſtance of its Works be conſidered, doth no more in it ſelf juſtify than the

doth not only ſhew what is to be done, but doth adminiſter Spirit and Virtue,

               <hi>Suarez,</hi> who for ſtrength of Mind, and clearneſs of Thought, is the beſt
of all the Schoolmen, ſpends the whole tenth Book of his large Volume a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Laws, to explain the Nature of this new Evangelical Law. He at the
very firſt lays down theſe two Aſſertions.<note n="p" place="bottom">Dicendum verò primò eſt Chriſtum dominum non ſolum ſuiſſe redemptorem, ſed etiam fuiſſe verum, &amp; proprium Legis latorem.—Dico ſecundo Lex Chriſti ſeu Lex no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va, eſt vera ac propriiſſima Lex praeceptiva. <hi>Suarez.</hi> de Legibus, lib. 10. cap. 2. pag. 696, 697. <hi>Mogunt.</hi> 1619.</note> 
               <q>1. That Chriſt was not only
a Redeemer but a true and proper Legiſlator. 2. That the Law of Chriſt,
or the new Law, is a true and moſt proper preceptive Law.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And then afterward aſſoiling that Difficulty, How this his new Law can ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify,
ſince it conſiſts in Precepts as well as the Old, and ſo could have no more
juſtifying Virtue in it than that:<note n="q" place="bottom">Ad diffitultatem eſt Reſponſio communis; gratiam convenire Legi novae quaſi per ſe, &amp; ex propris; antiquioribus vero Legibus non ex vi illarum, ſeu per ſe fuiſſe conjunctam, ſed per reſpectum ad Legem gratiae. Et ideo Legi gratiae ſimpliciter tribui juſtificationem non verò ſuperioribus Legibus.—Ob hanc ergo rationem ſpiritus gratiae dicitur eſſe proprius Legis novae quia data eſt eo tempore, in quo jam Author gratiae advenit, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demptionem hominum conſummavit, gratiam<expan>

               <q>But to this Difficulty (ſays he) there is
alſo a common Anſwer, That Grace doth agree to the new Law in it ſelf,
and as proper to it: but it was not join'd to the old preceding Laws from
their own force and Virtue, and as proper to them, but with reſpect to the
Law of Grace: And therefore Juſtification is ſimply attributed to the Law
of Grace, but not to the former Laws.—For this Reaſon therefore the
Spirit of Grace is ſaid to be proper to the new Law, becauſe this new Law
was given in which the Author of Grace was now come, and conſummated
the Redemption of Men, and merited Grace for all. Yes, he himſelf is the
Author, both of this Law and of Grace.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I will name one more, the Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> who as he fiercely oppos'd
the Doctrine of Grace, reviv'd by the firſt Reformers, he earneſtly ſat himſelf
to aſſert the Goſpel to be a new Law. And as he knew very well, that he
could not maintain the Merit of Works and Juſtification by them, without
this Aſſertion of the Goſpel's being a new Law, he begins his fourth Book
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:49801:39"/>
of Juſtification which is concerning the Righteouſneſs of Works, with eager
Endeavours to vindicate this Aſſertion againſt the Proteſtants. Among other
things, too long here to relate, he tells us; <q>That<note n="r" place="bottom">Et quidem ſi loquamur de Gratiâ Novi Teſtamenti, non diſtinguitur Lex ab Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelio: Quod Lex requirat opera, Evangelium non requirat opera; ſed quod Lex doceat quid ſit faciendum, Evangelium praebeat vires ad faciendum. Bellarm. de Juſtif. lib. 4. cap. 2. pag. 1011. In Tom. 4. Controv. <hi>Colon. Agrip.</hi> 1619.</note> indeed if we ſpeak of the
Grace of the New Teſtament, the Law is not diſtinguiſh'd from the Goſpel
in this, that the Law requires Works, but the Goſpel doth not require Works:
But in that the Law teacheth what is to be done, the Goſpel affords Strength
to do it. So that according to him, the new Law tho requiring Works, is
yet a Law of Grace, becauſe accompanied with Grace.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus it is evident, that for many paſt Ages down to our own, this Opinion
of the Goſpel's being a new Law was the conſtant Doctrine of the Anti-chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Church, and eagerly maintain'd to ſupport the Merit of Works. The So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians
and Arminians, as they join'd with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in denying the
Imputation of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, ſo they readily embrac'd this Figment of
the new Law; under the covert of which, they introduc'd an Evangelical
Righteouſneſs of our own in conformity to it, by which we are to be juſtified.
I ſhall not be large in proſecuting this Buſineſs, becauſe my Revernd and
Learned Brother, Mr. <hi>Stephen Lobb,</hi> will do it ſufficiently. I will only offer two
fair Evidences; the one of <hi>Socinus</hi> himſelf, the other of <hi>Epiſcopius.</hi>

that they are delighted with that Manner of Speaking, [<hi>viz.</hi> that Chriſt is a

much leſs becauſe they borrowed it from <hi>Socinus;</hi> but becauſe it is the Phraſe

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:49801:40"/>
and they believe nothing to be more neceſſary, than that it ſhould be
believ'd that Chriſt is the Maker of a new Law.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is plain then that this Aſſertion of the Goſpel's being a new Law, is a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh,
and Socinian, and Arminian Doctrine. What then ſhall I brand my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend
Brother with any of theſe hated Names? No, I am ſo far from doing
it, that I do not ſo much as think him to be on the Side of any of the three
Parties, tho he is ſo liberal in beſtowing Titles of Diſhonour upon thoſe who
differ from him, as to call them <hi>Antinomians;</hi> and ſo by virtue of an
hard Word, to name them the greateſt Villains which can live upon Earth.</p>
            <p>I know very well that the Papiſts, together with aſſerting the Goſpel to be
a Law, aſſert the Merit of Works; which is diſclaim'd by my Brother, and
yet is really included in his Hypotheſis: For what is Merit, but when the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
is due to ſome Work done? And now if the Goſpel be in that reſpect a
Law, that it requires Duties as Conditions of having a Claim to its Bleſſings,
and promiſes them to the Performance of thoſe Conditions, then to them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd,
tho of never ſo little Conſideration, the Bleſſings muſt be given not as
the Fruits of meer Grace, but as the Reſults of a juſt Debt. However, tho the
Opinion is not profeſſedly ſo rank as Popery, and Arminianiſm; yet in the
leaſt Nearneſs to thoſe deſtructive Errors there is Danger, and within the very
Confines dwell Plagues and Death. The People cannot then with too much
Zeal, be warned of the hazardous Approaches which lead them on to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd
into the Enemies Camp. They underſtand not the Niceties of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy,
and of Errors ſo refin'd that they eſcape their diſcerning they are not
afraid, and yet all the while the Venom works more deſperately for being
ſubtiliz'd, and the inviſible Spirits of it mortally ſeize their Brains, when they
ſtartled at the ſight of the Poiſon offer'd in its groſſer Bulk. I hope then my
Reverend Brother, and all others, will pardon me if my Love to the Truth
hath ſtirr'd me with ſome juſt Indignation againſt the Opinions, which fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
thoſe dangerous Errors concerning Juſtification by Works, and if I have
been moved to repreſent them in their own exact Shape and natural Colours.
For tho I will not avow theſe newly advanc'd Doctrines to be rank Popery,
and Arminianiſm; yet I muſt ſay, that they want but little of taking that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
and that even in this reſpect they are the more hurtful. For when a
groſs Error is wire-drawn to a ſlender Thred, it is the more miſchievous in
being not eaſily diſcernable, ſince ſo it ſlides inſenſibly into the Minds of the
Unwary. What tho the Merit of good Works is diſclaim'd; what tho the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinian
and Arminian Inferences from the Goſpel's being a new Law, are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own'd;
yet would it not be better for the Preſervation of the Truth in its Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and for the Safety of the Souls of the People, to forbear ſuch Phraſes and
Modes of Speech, which by the Enemies of the Goſpel are made uſe of to very
