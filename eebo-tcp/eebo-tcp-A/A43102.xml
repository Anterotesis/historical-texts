            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Then the Lord <hi>Rivers</hi> with about eight hundred men assaulted <hi>SALFORD</hi> on the other side of the VVater, and before the morning possessed himself of that Village being accounted the Suburbs of our Town, and rifled the Houses of all the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants who were forced to fly from their cruelty.</p>

to other all night without ceasing and yet thankes be to God without any dammage on our part.</p>
            <p>On Tuesday morning the Lord <hi>Strange</hi> sent a Message to the Towne, desiring a parley, at which he desired <hi>Cessation</hi> of <hi>Arms</hi> for 7. hours, which was granted, pretending he would come to Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conditions of Peace.</p>
            <p>But most persidiously in the time of Cessation, suffered his souldiers to plunder and pillage the Countries, and 2. or three Gentlemens Houses of good worth and credit, and very godly men, and seised up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a great house near the Town, upon which he caused to be planted two pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Ordnance to shoot to the Towne, and about three of the clock in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon the said Lord sent his Propositions of Peace to the town, <hi>to wit.</hi>

That he with his Army might have free pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage through the Towne which if they would grant, no prejudice or injury by him nor any of his Souldiers should be offered either to the persons or goods of any of the Townesmen; But wee refusing the same, he would then continue his seige and daiely assault with all the force he could; upon which Answer was returned wee would in no wise grant his demands, nor any other Propositions he should make, for he had violated his promise inti<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

            <p>On Wednesday morning the fight began again a fresh, and about twelve of the clock, about foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score of our men issued out of the Town to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary, with whom we had a sharp battell conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing for the space of 3. hours, but in the end the Enemy ga<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>On Friday the fight again began, and then the Lord Strange commanded their Ordnance to be charged with small bullets, to the end to scatter amongst us, but praised be God, none of our side were yet slain, we issued not out of the town this day till about two of the clock, and then marched out 1000. of us, with good hopes to have ended the siege, and routed our enemies, but it fell out con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, after about 2. or 3. hours fight with much courage on our side, the Souldiers of the enemy still running away in great numbers, being almost wearied, we sounded a retreat, for that night which the Lord Strange and his souldiers were right glad of not offering the least assault that night, this day were slain of their side not above 10. persons as we can know for certain, and about <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 words">

            <p>On Satterday morning the Lord Strange again sent a Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage to the Town for a cessation for two dayes, and in the meane time to have a Treaty for Peace. But we conceive that this was but to delay <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
