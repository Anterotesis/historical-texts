         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     </gap> there is diuine nature in the Meſſias.

                  <p>But, why is the epithet or word <hi>(Terrible)</hi> added?

From this multitude will I diſcerne mine owne people, that is, the right holy ones, which preferre the promiſe touching the mediator before ſacrifices, and doe knowe in what order ceremonies are to bee obſerued, and howe they pleaſe me namely by laying a foundation, that is, by acknowledging the mediator, and for his ſake in receiuing remiſſion of ſinnes, and beginning a new obedience mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall in their heart, which the commandement of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth. Such holy ones are the faithfull keepers of the teſtament or promiſe from me deliuered, and they are the publiſhers of righteouſnes which is made manifeſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the lawe, whereof the Lord and the Prophets doe beare witneſſe as in <hi>Rom.</hi> the <hi>3. chapter.</hi>

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:18503:35"/>
expounded in places theologicall.</p>
                  <p>For there is a ſixe-fold conſideration of things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary<note place="margin">A ſixefolde order to be conſidered in Prayer.</note> in Praier; firſt, we muſt conſider what we call vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, what maner of God, and where he made himſelfe kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen, to the ende thou maieſt diſcerne thy prayer from the prayer of the heathen: ſo in this place it is ſaide, Call<note place="margin">What God we call vpon.</note> vpon, not creatures, but me, the Creator and preſeruer of all things, made knowne by bringing the people out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> publiſhing the law, and ſending my onely begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Sonne into the world. Secondly, we muſt conſider<note place="margin">The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God vnto vs.</note> the commandement which is recited in theſe words, <hi>Call vpon me in the day of trouble:</hi> For, God will be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped with crauing of his grace, or fauour, and other giftes; to the end he may be diſcerned from euil natures, and that this honour may be giuen him, that he is wiſe, good, liberal, giuer of life, wiſdome, and other good gifts, and that he vouchſafeth to communicate his benefites vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs. And like as the breaking of that commandement, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill</hi> diſpleaſeth God: ſo alſo the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſecond commaundement, which is the neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of praier, diſpleaſeth him, where it is ſaid <hi>Ioh. 14. 13.</hi> and <hi>16. 23. Aske and ye ſhall receiue.</hi> The third conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration<note place="margin">Conuerſion of him that prayeth.</note> concerneth our conuerſion: for ſome man would ſay, what ſhall I aſke, ſeeing it is written, <hi>God heareth not ſinners, Matth. 9. 31.</hi> Here we muſt take holde vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the voice of the other <hi>Ezech. 33. 11. I liue</hi> (ſaieth the Lord) <hi>I will not the death of a ſinner, but that hee bee conuerted and liue.</hi> Let not him that calleth vpon God perſeuer and go forward in miſchiefes againſt conſcience, but let him be truely conuerted vnto God. And in euerie true prayer, conuerſion or repentance vnto God is made or increaſeth. The fourth conſideration is of the promiſe<note place="margin">Promiſe to him that prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</note> of grace, and confidence of the Mediator, that wee may come vnto God according to the ſaying, <hi>Epheſ. 3. 12. By him we dare boldly come by faith in him.</hi> Needefull it is then that we firſt by faith receiue forgiuenes of ſins,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:18503:36"/>
or reconciliation, and beleeue that praier pleaſeth God, and is not fruſtrate. Furthermore alſo other promiſes touching other benefits and the mitigation of calamities, muſt be looked vppon, as is here ſaide, <hi>Call vpon me in the day of tribulation, and I will deliuer thee.</hi> The fift conſideration of faith, here we muſt knowe, that faith<note place="margin">Asking in faith: Beleeuing God.</note> which craueth forgiueneſſe, reconciliation, life euerlaſting, and gouernment of the ſoule, ought in forme to craue theſe ſelfe ſame benefites, and looke for them without conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; becauſe God wil haue theſe to be craued for by name; and not to haue theſe gifts, is, to remaine an enemie of God, and to reproach God, or to iniure him according to the ſaying, <hi>He that beleeueth not in the Sonne, the wrath of God remaineth vpon him.</hi> Againe, he repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth God of lying. But faith which craueth corporall good things, as <hi>Dauid</hi> crauing of God, that he might be brought againe into his kingdome, required it with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; <hi>if it pleaſed God:</hi> becauſe both things muſt be knowen of vs, that we muſt aſke theſe benefites, and yet, that the church muſt be ſubiect vnto the croſſe, and oweth obedience vnto God, according to the ſaying <hi>1. Pet. 5. 6. Humble your ſelues vnder the mightie hand of God:</hi> and yet the prayer is not fruſtrated: for either the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is taken quite away, or elſe mitigated. Finally, needefull it is, that we moſt firmely keepe this rule: yea euen when we haue loſt our corporall benefits, and when we muſt aſſuredly forgo the life of the body, yet muſt we needes retaine the promiſe of grace and life euerlaſting, like as <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith <hi>cap. 13. 15. Yea thoug he ſhal kil me, yet will I truſt in him, and he ſhall be my Sauiour.</hi> The fixt conſideration of things to be craued, is, as ſaint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith in his firſt epiſtle <hi>ch. 5. 14, 15. Whatſoeuer thing<note place="margin">Asking accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Gods will obtaineth all.</note> you ſhall aske according to his wil he ſhal giue it you:</hi> that is, you may not aſke things forbidden by God, but ſuch as the manner of aſking them may agree with the table of the commandements, and with Gods promiſes,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:18503:36"/>
touching ſpirituall and corporall benefits. And God will haue Prayer and Faith to be exerciſed of vs, in crauing, not onely ſpirituall, but corporall benefites, according to the ſaying in <hi>Mathew 6. 11. Giue vs this day our dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bread.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For we muſt alwayes holde faſt the rule; In crauing of corporall benefites, faith ought to ſhine forth, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth the promiſe of grace: and we muſt adde hereunto an admonition touching circumſtances; namely, of the time, and of the maner of our deliuerance: God wil haue his preſence in the church to be acknowledged, and his help to be craued and looked for: he will haue our faith, prayer and hope to be exerciſed, and will not haue mens counſels or mens deuiſes to beare any ſway in gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our life; but hee will haue it knowen, that the church is gouerned by God aboue. He doth not then giue ſucceſſe by and by, and by ſuch maner of meanes, as mans reaſon conceiueth: like as <hi>Ioſeph, Ionas,</hi> and very many others in all ages were deliuered, far otherwiſe than they themſelues could deuiſe. Let theſe ſeeme to be ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well enough ſpoken touching <hi>Praier,</hi> becauſe there are exerciſed theologicall places in all mens hands, and other Bookes containing a longer explication or opening at ful of this vertue.</p>
                  <p>But like as God requireth of vs a petition in our prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to the end we ſhould acknowledge that there is a God, and that he is almighty, preſent, and a helper, that hee might communicate himſelfe in ſuch acknowledgement vnto vs: So he requireth a giuing of thankes, that this acknowledgement may go forward in vs. For when the acknowledgement of God is extinguiſhed in vnthankeful perſons, God then ceaſeth any longer to communicate himſelfe vnto them: like as moſt part of ſecure perſons after benefites receiued, do trifle it out with ſuch like co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations: perhappes thou art deliuered by chance, &amp;c. ſo they loſe quite the acknowledgement and preſence of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:18503:37"/>
God, when with the following commemoration and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion they ought to nouriſh and confirme the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of God and faith in him.</p>
                  <p>Seeing therefore <hi>Thankeſgiuing</hi> is a neceſſary wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping, there are for the moſt part, precepts ioyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with Prayer and Thankeſgiuing; becauſe both of them are neceſſary vnto the acknowledgement of God, as in this Pſalme it is thus ſaid, <hi>Call vpon me in the time of trouble and I wil deliuer thee, and thou ſhalt praiſe me, Pſal. 50. 15.</hi> verſe.</p>
                  <p>To what purpoſe then is this particle, <hi>In the day of trouble?</hi> firſt it ſignifieth that the glory of praier (the che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt of all others) ſhineth in aduerſitie or calamities: for all men in time of proſperity become more negligent then at other times, as in that verſe it is ſaid, <hi>Ouid de art Am.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>But in aduerſities and calamities praier is feruent, and not only craueth, but ſeeketh and knocketh. Furthermore, this little clauſe admoniſheth vs, that we ſhould earneſtly thinke vpon the publike and priuate perilles, wherein the church waxing old, and al the godly ones are exerciſed and diſtreſſed: for the nearer the day of the latter iudgement is at hand, ſo much more outrageous wrathfull ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the deuill againſt Chriſt: namely nowe fearing the ſentence wherein the exceeding filthines of the moſt prowd ſpirit ſhal be manifeſted vnto all creatures, and the horrible torments due vnto him ſhalbe increaſed.

This promiſe ought to be imbraced by fayth, becauſe it is the euerlaſting and immutable commaundement of God, that, in our conuerſion, (that is, in our vnfained ſorowes and feares) wee ſhould beleeue, we are receiued for his

Like vnto this is the other alſo, where hee craueth a <hi>right ſpirit,</hi> that is, not wauering in the word, not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried about with euery winde of doctrine, nor doubting in the will of God: But a heart ſtriuing againſt doubting, and ſurely and firmely ſetling it ſelfe in the promiſe, and which ſurely beleeueth that it hath God merciful, and that it is heard of God, and in this confidence calleth vppon God, and looketh for help from God: ſecondly, hee cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth<note place="margin">The holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</note> the <hi>holy ſpirit,</hi> that is, ſanctifying and illumining in our hearts ſuch motions, as he himſelfe is: for, as the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ghoſt is a ſubſtantiall loue, and coeternall ioy betwixt the Father and the Sonne; ſo is he ſent into the heartes of beleeuers, that hee may inflame in them loue and ioy ſetled in God, like as in <hi>2.

But here let vs conſider of the cauſes why the politicall lawe of <hi>Moſes</hi> was deſtroied, than which, there was none more excellent in al the world. And certs the firſt cauſe is, for that it pleaſed God to ſet downe<note place="margin">1</note> an horrible or fearefull example of his wrath againſt the enemies of Chriſt: Touching this cauſe Chriſt ſaith <hi>Luke 19. 44. Becauſe thou kneweſt not the time of thy viſitation. &amp;c.</hi> Therefore in theſe daies let them feare like puniſhments, which either deſpiſe the pure doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the goſpel with an Epicuriall contempt, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deour what they can to deſtroy the ſame with an vngodly wilfull ſtubbernes.

                     <pb n="142" facs="tcp:18503:75"/>
which they had in their owne nation might be taken away: For if <hi>Moiſes</hi> his policie, ſhould as vnto this day haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, no doubt of this theſe which were conuerted out of the Jewes would chalenge and take to themſelues a ſingular prerogatiue for their temple and ceremonies which they had. The fifth cauſe, that the deſtruction of the ſame policie might witneſſe that Chriſt hath beene preſent vpon earth. For it behaued that Chriſt ſhould be borne in <hi>Bethleem,</hi> and in very deede ſo was he when the policie of <hi>Moyſes</hi> ſtoode in force.
