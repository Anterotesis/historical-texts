            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE General Lamentations which the sad Occasion of this present Assembly has raised over this whole Countrey, as in a common Calamity, where every one bears a share, because so many do feel it, have so far prevented me in all that can be said to the praise of her, whose <hi>Remains</hi> are now to be laid up in the belief of the <hi>Resurrection of the Iust,</hi> at which time they are to be restored to her again, that I am very sensible it is not necessary to say any thing concerning her, for the raising among you the esteem that is due to her Memory, which is, and must be long very dear to you all. But as there is some disadvantage in speaking what is
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65709:4"/>
proper on this Subject, before those who knew her well, and so will think that I am as reserved in commending her, as she her self was in hiding her own Worth, and in concealing those <hi>Works</hi> which do now <hi>praise her;</hi> yet on the other hand I speak with the more assurance, because it is in the Countrey where she spent so many of her years. I should be afraid to say all that I have resolv'd on, if it were in the Audience of such as had been Strangers to the Course of her Life: It is a nice and tender thing to praise, especially in this Vicious and corrupted Age, in which so many are concerned to keep themselves in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and to decry a Virtue that must needs make their Vices shew more foul and odious; and who cannot bear what is due to others, because they know that it does not belong to themselves. And it must be confessed, that excessive Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations on these Occasions, in compliance with Custom, and the tenderness that seems then decent, where Flattery is thought more excusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, because the Person commended does not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it; these, I say, have given but too much reason to disregard what is said in discourses of this kind, in which it passes for a sort of rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness not to exceed, and for an unkindness to the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65709:4"/>
Friends of the Dead, not to praise out of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. But I am less in pain to enlarge upon this Subject, when I have so many Vouchers before me, and when I am to speak of things that have been so long the Observation of all these parts. I will use as little art in Speaking, as She did in Living; and will study to dress up a Memorial for her, with such a decent Simplicity, as she used in the dressing her Person, which as she did in haste, so I will be as short as may be. I will for some time interrupt my speaking of her, and consider the Text I have read to you, that so I may return with the more advantage to prosecute what I have now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun.</p>
            <p>This Chapter is a Poetical Composure; it is an <hi>Accrostick</hi> in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> according to the Custom of that time, for the help of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory. Every Verse, from the 10th to the end, begins with a new Letter of the Alpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet in their order. It is to little purpose to examine, whether the King, called <hi>Lemuel,</hi> to whom it is addressed, be <hi>Solomon</hi> under a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guised designation, or not; and whether it was a Poem made by his Mother, directing him how to chuse a Wife, and giving him a full
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65709:5"/>
Character of the Excellencies of a good one, suitable to the Simplicy of those Ages and Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, in which Women of the highest Rank, and even Queens themselves, managed their own Domestick Concerns; or if it was a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s, setting forth, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny enlargements of Poesy, the Advices that his Mother had given him; or if he only brings in the Person of his Mother, to make his Poetry look more Natural. It is to very little purpose to enquire into all this, and not possible to determine any part of it: Certain it is, that we have here a very noble and Elegant Description, of a faithful and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate, a discreet and an industrious Wife; who as she applied her chief care to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of her Husband and Children, so negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted not any of her Houshold-Affairs; she rise early, and sate up late; wrought with her own hands, and looked to the ways of her Houshold; she took care that her whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily should be well imployed; she was an honour as well as a help to her Husband: Her whole behaviour was both prudent and obliging; <hi>She opened her mouth with wisdom,</hi> not to evil speaking, nor idle talking; and <hi>in her
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65709:5"/>
tongue was the law of kindness;</hi> an exact, but engaging decency.</p>
            <p>All this is concluded with a short song, in which her Husband and Children should cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate her Praises, which, as it is probable, was to be sung among them by turns, according to the way of the <hi>Eastern</hi> Musick: The first might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, <hi>Many daughters have done vertuously;</hi> and to this another might answer, <hi>But thou excellest them all:</hi> Then one might sing, <hi>Favour is deceitful;</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Beauty is vain:</hi> And both together, <hi>But the woman that feareth the Lord, she shall be praised.</hi> Then one might sing, <hi>Give her,</hi> and another answer, <hi>of the fruit of her hands;</hi> and then both together, and <hi>Let her own works praise her in the gates.</hi> There is a plain Intimation given of the custom that was among the <hi>Jews</hi> to sing this Song by turns, on two of their great Solemnities in the <hi>Misna</hi>

            <p>By <hi>Favour,</hi> is to be meant all that is insinuating in a Womans Humour, Manner, and Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by which a Husband may be charmed: This is often <hi>deceitful,</hi> and under it a great deal of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyalty and Treachery is both hid and managed; these Arts being so many Practices upon the easie Husband, to deceive and blind him, to impose any thing upon him, and to obtain every thing
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65709:6"/>
from him. Therefore, tho a lively Air, a grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Behaviour, a soft Manner, a Pleasantness of Humour, and an entertaining Conversation, are very valuable Qualities, and have Powerful Charms in them, yet all this may be <hi>deceitful;</hi> much baseness and falshood may be under them; so that this singly cannot make a good Character.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Beauty is vain;</hi> this which strikes the eye, as the other does the Imagination, is yet slighter, it is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten false, especially in the East where beauty is as oft the work of Art, as of Nature, and it had been well if that practice had remained in the <hi>East</hi> still, and had not come into these <hi>Western</hi> parts; but suppose the Beauty to be both true and exact, <hi>it is vain</hi> in many other respects: It does not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways lodge a pure Soul, which does often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the more deformity, because it dwells with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a beautiful Figure, that but too often feeds pride, and is set off with Vanity, which both draws ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration and delights in it: it does insensibly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve the mind into voluptuousness, and in the end intangle it into many snares, and expose it to much Sin. It is <hi>Vain</hi> in another respect, it is subject to many accidents which may blast it, and if it escapes these, yet it must yield at last and fade with Age, if by the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitated
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65709:6"/>
wastings of Nature and other disorders, it does not fall sooner. These words run thus in the <hi>Hebrew, Favour, Falshood, Beauty, Vanity,</hi> and perhaps every one of these was to be sung by turns as the answer to the other.</p>
            <p>These are the two things by which that Sex is chiefly recommended to those who make slight and hasty Judgments, and that do often perceive their error when it is too late to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect it: but that upon which a true one can only be formed, lies in the words that follow<hi>—But the woman that feareth the Lord, she shall be praised.</hi> The fear of a discovery, and of shame; the fear of a Husband, and the apprehensions of his displeasure, are but feeble principles: they may restrain one at some times, and from some temptations, but it is only the <hi>fear of God</hi> that subdues the heart, that shoots its influence into the secretest springs of our actions, that overcomes the strongest inclinations, even in their first and invisible motions: this sets a Law, not only to one's actions, but to his very thoughts: The conduct of the outward part of life, when that is contradicted by the wishes and desires which are allowed a free range within, is but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint, and the acting of a part which is not
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65709:7"/>
natural; and nothing that is an affected force upon Nature can be either easy or lasting. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will be always at some time or other too hard for Rule and Form. And even a Firm Resolution will soon grow heavy and will at last be forgotten, if there are not principles for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med within, that give it a root, and afford it nourishment: therefore Vertue can have no settled basis nor foundation, unless its bottom be the <hi>true fear of God,</hi> a secret sence of a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream and perfect mind, that sees all we do, and that will judge us at last according to all that we have done. When this is lodged in the most retired corners of our Hearts; when the sense of it returns often upon us, to acquit or to condemn us; when we measure our selves and all our actions by our conformity to this Eternal Being; when we reckon it our supreme and only happiness, to become like unto it, and accepted of it; when no exercises become more delighting to us, than our Meditating of its Perfections, and of all the discoveries that it has made of it self; and when upon these Contemplations the mind grows to love and adore that Being, and to prostrate it self often before it, and dedicate it self entirely to serve and please it in all
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65709:7"/>
things, Then Virtue has a true fastning within, to which it cleaves, and which will support and strengthen it: And indeed Virtue, and the Fear of God do so mutually maintain one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that these who are equally Enemies to both, know that the rooting out the one, will soon draw the other after it. The Prophane Tribe of <hi>Libertines</hi> does chiefly hate Religion, because Virtue does ever accompany it; they find it often in their way, and wish there were as little of it in the World, as they feel in their own Breasts: but it were too barefaced a thing to endeavour to strike both at <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> at once. There is a sound in <hi>Vertue</hi> that carries Majesty with it, and commands the esteem of the whole World, so such as hate it, know that they must take care not to discover that too soon, lest they should draw a general Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon themselves. But <hi>Religion</hi> they think may be more safely struck at; the diversities a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, the scandals given by many that have pretended to it, the Invisible objects to which it relates; the distance we live at from the Ages in which the Miracles that confirmed it were wrought, and the many Impostures that have been put upon weak and credulous Multitudes,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65709:8"/>
do all afford some plausible appearances, which set off with Boldness and Scorn, and served up with Mirth and Gaiety, have been fatally suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful in Poysoning weak minds that cannot lay many things together, and cannot distinguish between Truth and the Varnish of it. But while these do thus undermine <hi>Religion,</hi> they seem to be mightily in love with <hi>Virtue,</hi> and pretend that it has had great force on Minds upon whom <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> had none at all; and that it may maintain its power very well in the Souls of Men, tho they were not over-awed with secret Terrours. Whereas in truth, they only hate <hi>Religion</hi> for the sake of that <hi>Virtue,</hi> which it commands and secures: and they could well look on, and let <hi>Religion</hi> bear full sway in the world, if it consisted only in some dark Speculations, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Performances, and contented with these, left men at liberty to do what they pleased; they know, and all the World has observed it too often, That as soon as the Impressions of <hi>Religion</hi> are defaced, the strength of <hi>Virtue</hi> is gone: for why should Men restrain their Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, bridle their Passions, and deny them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves any pleasures or advantages, if there is no sovereign Mind over us, to whom Obedience is
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65709:8"/>
due, who will reckon with us, and reward or punish us eternally according as we lead that course of life here, which he has assigned us as our passage to Eternity. If there is nothing in <hi>Virtue,</hi> but <hi>decency, interest,</hi> or <hi>humour,</hi> as these are all weak Principles, not able to bear much weight on them; so when both <hi>pleasure</hi> and <hi>advantage</hi> are in the other Scale, they will certainly downweigh them. Hence it is, that all those who go off from a Religious Education, and from the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Practises that must support it, do soon forsake all the strictness of Virtue. The fear of God is that Principle alone that can sanctify and perfect our Nature; the having our Minds full of high and sublime thoughts of that Supream Being that made and governs the World, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a just sense of his Authority over us, of our obligation to obey all his Laws, and to conform our very thoughts to his Nature and Will, and the framing our whole Lives, and the laying out our whole time, so as we may be ever accepted of by him, is the just and true notion of the fear of God. If any imagine that it consists only in the having some terrible thoughts of God, and of Sin, the performing some duties to God as a homage that will please
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65709:9"/>
him, and the looking over past Sins with some sad thoughts; and when that is done, if men return to them, and continue in them, and are only now and then a little troubled when they reflect on them, which is all the Notion that the greatest part, even of those who pass in the World for Religious, entertain of it, it is no wonder that great advantages are taken to decry Religion it self, when this is believed to be all the effect and power that it has. But the true <hi>fear of God</hi> is a much deeper Principle, and has a more noble ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect on all the powers of the Soul; it charms as well as reforms them, and elevates as well as it fortifies them; it follows a man to his Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and there if at any time it humbles him, it does quickly raise him up again: it gives him solid joys, when he perceives that he carries God's Image upon him, and is reconciled to him; it follows him through the whole bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, and even through the diversions of Life: It governs his Mind, and guides his Actions, and though the sound of the Word <hi>Fear</hi> carries terror in it, yet how severe so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the operation of it must be upon some occasions, it generally gives it such a noble sense of the goodness, as well as of the greatness of God, that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65709:9"/>
it becomes a Fear of Reverence tempered with Love, and not a Dread full of Guilt that strikes Horror. Those good Minds that give up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the Conduct of this <hi>Fear,</hi> and come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der its Discipline, feel both a Strength in it to govern them, and a Calm in it to settle them. If they do truly fear God, it exalts them above all base and dispiriting Fears; So that they fear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else; all the Accidents of Life and Death it self can give no Terror, where this has once had its true Effect. For a Man that <hi>fears God,</hi> and feels himself to be so governed by this <hi>Fear,</hi> that he has all Reason to conclude he is in his Favour, and under his Protection, is thereby raised far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all other Depressions; nothing can disturb him but his apprehensions of having offended that Goodness which he fears: and sometimes a great Tenderness of Mind, joyned with a deep Sence of Duty, will raise sad Reflections in those who have the justest Cause of rejoycing always in God. But such cloudy Thoughts, though they may at sometimes disquiet them a little, yet have a good Effect on them; they oblige them to great watchfulness, and beget in them a particular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to their Duty: and that very Anxiety which was the Effect of their Tenderness, and that raised some melancholly distrust in them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65709:10"/>
their own Condition, shews plainly how deep a Root this <hi>Fear</hi> has in them, when such ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions prove so painful.</p>
            <p>These are the happy Souls that rise above the World, and all its vain Hopes and Fears, and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle their Minds on God, whom they fear and serve with their whole Hearts. <hi>A Woman that fears the Lord,</hi> has in her Constitution and Method of Life, some advantages that help her forward to this Disposition of Mind; and she hath at the same time other things that ballance this in her. The Affections of that Sex are more tender, they are less hardy and bold; they are under a greater Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity of Form; <hi>Decency</hi> and <hi>Modesty</hi> are great Defences: They are not so much exposed to the Temptations that are in the World; they live at home, and do not range abroad; their Children, especially those of their own Sex, give them a constant Entertainment, and do commonly carry away much of their Hearts and Time; so that they are out of that loose Ramble, which is the great Corruption of Mankind. But to ballance all this, their Education is not so studied, nor so laboured, that thereby great Notions, and strong Reasonings may be formed in them, which give a Foundation to Knowledge and Religion; all which is more commonly laid in the Youth of our
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65709:10"/>
Sex. The Affections of Women are laid deep in their Natures, so that the common Afflictions of Life, especially of a Married State, from the Loss of Children, or of their Husbands, go far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into their Minds, and sink, and shake them more violently; to which the Decencies of their Griefs, that do, as it were, stake them down to it, contribute not a little; which do not allow them the Diversions to which Custom gives Men a freer and earlier admittance. These are the Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Disadvantages that they have, with Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a Religious Course of Life. Upon the whole Matter, it must be acknowledged, from the Observation of all Ages, that this Sex has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the Eminentest, the most Exact, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemished, the most Charitable and Bountiful, and the most Serious and Devout Fearers and Servers of God, that the World has yet had, and that <hi>Religion</hi> has never shined brighter than in their whole Deportment. And therefore such Women, especially if they happen to be in an Age in which Libertinism and Impiety has not only corrupted our Sex, but has even broke through the Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty of theirs, and almost made a Rape upon it; and in which all the Exactness of Vertue, and the Strictness of a Regular Life, has been laughed at, and despised, as the <hi>Stiffness of Form.</hi> I say,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65709:11"/>
in such an Age as ours, <hi>Women</hi> of Rank and Birth, of Quality and Fortune, that in spite of a Torrent of Vice, that had got Credit by Great Examples, and had lost the Sense of Shame by the Multitude of those that went into it, will still own and practice Religion and Vertue in the strictest and exactest manner ought to be celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with just Praises: And if the Example is set by them in such a manner, as not to frighten any from <hi>Religion,</hi> by the mixture of <hi>morose Sourness,</hi> or by the affectation of <hi>singular</hi> or <hi>superstitious</hi> Practices: If it, on the contrary, is shewed in Instances that must needs recommend <hi>Religion</hi> by the excellent Effects it has, and by the soft and gentle manner with which it is managed, then the <hi>Memory</hi> of such a <hi>Woman</hi> ought to be precious, it ought to be honoured with such deserved Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations, as are one part, though it be indeed one of the smallest, of the Rewards that are due unto Vertue. When this is so done, that it is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Flattery has no share in it, that it cannot corrupt the Person that is praised, into Vanity or Haughtiness of Mind, and when the chief Intent of such Praises is to set forth to the World a fresh Instance of the <hi>Power of Religion,</hi> and of its happy Influence upon whole Neighbourhoods, for the incouragement and instruction of such as
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65709:11"/>
chuse to follow good Patterns, then such Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations as they, are a piece of Natural E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and Justice; So they may give occasion to a Noble Emulation, and may offer a more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar and sensible Direction than can be given in Rules or Precepts. I need not add to all this, That no Custom has been more ancient, nor more universal among all Civilized Nations than the setting forth the Praises of the Dead at their Funerals: But indeed these have been ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally given out so lavishly, and often so unjust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that all Discourses of this kind appear with great Prejudices against them, and therefore they ought to be severely weighed.</p>
            <p>The following Words in my Text give such measures, that if these be observed, all Errors and Excesses will be prevented.<hi>—Give her the Fruit of her own Hands;</hi> That is, let her not be praised by a pompous setting forth of those things that were not her own, such as her Birth and Fortune, which are only the Distinctions of Divine Providence, by which Persons of Noble Minds are set in a higher Sphere, and are made capable of giving a more conspicuous Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and of being a more general and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65709:12"/>
Good to Mankind. Therefore the shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what were the real Instances, and the good Effects of her <hi>Religion,</hi> is the most proper way of praising her: and the less Pomp of Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, or Art of Disposition and Expression, that accompanies such a Description, it comes the nearer the Rules that are here given<hi>—Let her own Works praise her in the Gates.</hi> Among the <hi>Jews,</hi> their Courts of Judicature, and other Solemn Assemblies, were at their <hi>Gates:</hi> It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing judged much safer for a City, that the chief place of <hi>Concourse</hi> should rather be at and about its <hi>Gates,</hi> than in its <hi>Heart</hi> and <hi>Center:</hi> So that by <hi>Gates</hi> we are to understand the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of the People; and there it was that <hi>her Works</hi> were to <hi>praise her,</hi> every one having somewhat to say, that had either fallen under his own Observation, or that had come to his Knowledg: There was no need of an <hi>Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> to recite them, of a <hi>Poet</hi> to adorn them, or of <hi>Hired Mourners</hi> to sing them out in doleful Tunes, which were the Methods of those Times: All these might well be spared, when the Universal Sense of the Town, and the Groans of the Neighbourhood agreed in the same Character, and that a <hi>General Lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:65709:12"/>
followed a <hi>Common Loss.</hi> This is a Pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyrick that can never be suspected; for no Man misdoubts those Tears that fall upon a real Loss. When the Widows came to mourn over <hi>Dorcas,</hi> who had been <hi>full of good Works,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Acts 9. 39.</note> 
               <hi>and Alms-Deeds,</hi> and shewed the <hi>Coats and Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> which she had not only given them' but <hi>had made for them while she was with them:</hi> Here was a more powerful Strain of Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick than the most studied Composures.</p>
            <p>The reciting the Names, the Vertues and the Sufferings of the Primitive Christians and Martyrs, was in the First Ages of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty a great part even of the Office of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> it self; and the striking the Names of any out of those Registers and Memorials, was reckoned to be one of the severest Acts of the Discipline of the Church. It is true, the Abuses that were ushered in by this, do well excuse us, though in this particular we do not conform our selves to so ancient a Custom; yet when singular Instances come in our way, as we ought to rejoice to see that <hi>Religion</hi> has not yet lost its force, but can even in this degenerate Age, give Noble Instances of the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65709:13"/>
Power it has, and of the Effects that follow it, so we ought to set it out in its True and Natural Colours. We are not indeed to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Steps of a Church, that as she is made up of Lies, so lies more impudently in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing than in dressing up the Legends, and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth the Excellencies of those who have contributed to her enriching, or to her Exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that does plainly shew no regard ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to what is true, or to what is so much as likely in the Lives, or rather the Fables that are given out of her Saints: In which it is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, that no Care is had to tell things truly as they were, but as they think they ought to have been done; and that is managed in such a manner, as may most powerfully work on the Credulity or Superstition of the Age in which they write: They varying the Performances of their <hi>Saints</hi> according to the Taste of the several Ages in which they happen to write; and by these means they serve their Ends of deceiving the World by this Exchange of Sophisticated Ware, for the wealth and advantages that it brings to them. <hi>But we have not so learned Christ,</hi> we know no other <hi>Arts</hi> but the plain Simplicity of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; we dare not <hi>lye for God,</hi> and much less for the best Person upon <hi>Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:65709:13"/>
And now I am brought back to the Subject with which I began. If we have here before us the earthly Tabernacle of a Woman that <hi>feared the Lord,</hi> then it is just and reasonable for us to <hi>praise Her;</hi> but in the praising Her, I shall strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly observe the Direction of my Text, I will only <hi>give her those</hi> Commendations that are due to Her, that are <hi>the Fruit of her Hands,</hi> and will set before you some of <hi>Her Works,</hi> and leave them to <hi>praise Her</hi> by an Eloquence, that will have more Force and Beauty in it, than can be possibly put in Words. I will say nothing but that which I have good reason to believe to be true: for though I had not the honour of so particular a Knowledge of Her, as to be able to form out of it an entire Character, yet what I saw in Her, shewed so sincere and so profound a Piety, so severe and scrupulous a Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, so pure a Conscience, and such an exact Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, that from thence I have good reason to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve other Particulars, which I have received from those who have been long the nearest Witnesses to the whole Course of Her Life.</p>
            <p>This I must say, and you all know it to be true, that both in the Neighbouring City, which is the chief Part of my Care, and in this whole Countrey, She hath had this Character, to have been the greatest Example, and the Instrument of the most
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65709:14"/>
Good, of any Person that has been in these Parts within the Memory of Man.</p>
            <p>I will not lessen what I am to say concerning Her, by any account of Her Birth, of the Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of her own Family, or of that into which She married, nor of the Greatness of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune that descended to Her; if I should speak of these, I should not <hi>give her the Fruit of her own Hands;</hi> only it is no small part of a Character, that such things can neither swell a Mind to Pride, nor dissolve it into Vanity or Sensuality: Her descending to the concerns of the meanest Persons; Her going so oft about to the poorest Houses, where Her Charity or Assistance was necessary; Her constant care of the Sick; Her supplying them so plentifully with Medicines from that vast Store that She provided for them; Her sending oft for Physicians and Surgeons to them; Her frequent handling and dressing their Sores Herself, when Surgeons could not be had, which as She never affected to do, so She never declined it where it was necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; Her kneeling so oft down, and treating Ulcers which were so loathsome, that no Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity less than Hers, could have endured so odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a Sight; Her not being afraid even of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious Diseases, except that of the small Pox,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:65709:14"/>
in which Her care of Her Children obliged her to more Caution: All these Particulars of which I appeal to you that are before me, how many Instances you have seen and known, do fully shew that Her Rank and Fortune were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly considered by Herself as so many Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon Her, to be <hi>rich in good Works, and to be cloathed with Humility.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to give you her Character in that which according to my Text gives a just Title to praise, <hi>She feared the Lord greatly,</hi> she had so deep a sense of Religion, that she spent a great part of her time both in studying the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which she had laid well up in her Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, and in reading Books both of Devotion and of Instruction in Matters of Religion, which she did carefully: those who have attended on her many Years, have assured me, that she would not lose quite that time which was set off for her Dressing, and which the far greatest part make to be a studied and lengthened Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but she used then, either to read herself, or imploy another to do it, that so her Mind might have some share of that Time, and that it might not go all to her Person. She made Extracts out of many Books, but in short-hand, since they were only intended for her own or her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65709:15"/>
use; she also used her short-hand in taking the edifying Parts of Sermons, which she went over in private afterwards with her Children; she was frequent and constant in secret Prayer, which had been, as she owned to me, the chief Joy and Support of her Life; in that it was that she found Strength to bear the loss of Six Sons, one after another, all she ever had, and a dear Husband that was more than all: who was so dear to her, that with this single Consideration she quieted her Mind, after the loss of one Son which happened soon after her Lord had recovered of a great Sickness, that she could not complain of any thing which God did to her after he had granted her so great a Blessing. She was a Religious Observer of the Lord's-Day, but without Superstition or Affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; she never fail'd in a Course of many Years while in Health, to lay hold of every opportunity of receiving the Sacrament, and was always retired a day or two before it, and did rise ever very early on Communion-days, that she might be for a considerable time retir'd before she went to Church: She observed the daily Returns of religious Performances in her Family in a most regular manner, the Prayers of the Church being never discontinued, nor so much
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:65709:15"/>
as put off. She was constant in the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Church, and had so hearty an affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to it, that when she saw the danger of our being over-run with Popery, she exprest her sense of it in the tenderest manner, and told her Children that she had much rather go with them to a Stake, than see them defile themselves with the Idolatry of the Mass; yet her Zeal for her Religion did not transport her to any uncharitable Excesses, and therefore she had a due regard to Vertue and Goodness whereso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever she saw it. But though all about her saw how much Religion possessed her Thoughts, yet she shewed it as little as was possible, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept where the Obligations of a Mother, or of a Mistress of a Family required it. She took care to have all her Family know and fear God, such as could not read, she allowed them both Time and Books, and other necessary Helps for it, and she furnished all about her, not only those of her Houshold, but of the Countrey quite round her, with such Books as might instruct and direct them; and as her Modesty made that she would not assume to herself to be a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prover of those that were not under her Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, so the way she took, where she saw any occasion for it, was to send them such
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65709:16"/>
Books, in which they might find the Reproofs that they needed. When she reproved her Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, those who have been twenty Years a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her, have assured me she never did it in words of Reproach or Anger, but in the way that she believed was the most proper to have a good effect on them. She said, she was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally passionate; but she came to be early un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Power of Religion, and broke herself so entirely from it, that those who have known her the longest, do affirm they never saw her at any one time under the Power of it: She was more particularly gentle to those who were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately about her, so that neither her Grief for those great Afflictions, with which it pleased God to visit her, nor the sharp Pains, nor lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring Disease of which she died, ever drew an indecent Expression from her.</p>
            <p>Her Religion as it gave her much Joy, so it gave her some Trouble, while by an exactness that carried her into too scrupulous a Jealousy of her self; she was too apt to censure her own Defects and Coldnesses. She chose a proper Guide, to whom she gave frequently an account of the various Scenes of Thoughts that passed <note place="margin">The Lord <gap reason="illegible" extent="5 letters">
                     <desc>•••••</desc>
                  </gap>p of <hi>Worce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</hi>
               </note> in her Mind; her choice of one of my Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Brethren shewed how well she could judg
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:65709:16"/>
of a Person fit for such a Confidence, and she had found, as she told me, great Benefit and Comfort in his Conduct. Her Soul was so wholly dedicated to God, that she seemed to have no other concern upon her, but how to know and to do her Duty upon all Occasions; and it made even the Burden of her Sickness a redoubled Affliction to her, because it depres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed her Spirits, so that she could not raise them up to God, with that Chearfulness and Joy that she had felt on other Occasions; and that she did not fly towards Death with so entire a willingness, as had often formerly inflamed her Thoughts: she thought that even the desire of seeing the last part of her Care setled and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the World, was a concern below that Elevation of Soul with which a Christian ought to entertain the Approaches of Death.</p>
            <p>With all this deep Sense of Religion she had no sort of Affectation, Singularity, Censorious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or Sourness of Temper; she had all the decent chearfulness about her that became her, tho always governed with a stay'd Gravity, she affected nothing that made any extraordinary shew, so that in all indifferent things she lived like those of her Rank. She never placed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in little and assumed Severities, but stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:65709:17"/>
in the whole Course of her Life, to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise that <hi>pure Religion and undefiled with God and the Father, which is to visit the Widows and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therless in their Affliction, and to keep her self unspot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the World.</hi> She was free from that Spirit of Censoriousness, to which even good People are too prone; perhaps through the sharpness of their Zeal against Sin: but when the occasions of observing the Evil that was in the World came in her way, she made the right use of them in proper Reflections on them, to those who were under her Care. She loved the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacies of the Countrey, much more than the Diversions and Disorders of the Town: She loved to be at quiet, and to be either impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving her own Mind, or to be doing good to others: She had attained to a great understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the matters of Religion, and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and was not only conversant in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical, but even in the speculative parts of it. So much study as she used, with so true a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as she had, carried her a great way: next to that she studied Physick most; as that by which she found she had the greatest opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of doing the most good; and in this she set no bounds to her Care and Labour, and to the expence it drew with it: and in her later
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65709:17"/>
Years the extent of her Charity and the Zeal and Tenderness of it grew upon her very sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly; She had observed one constant Practice, upon any special Blessing that she received from God, to make a particular Largess of Charity, besides her ordinary Givings: but this of late encreased to great Sums, that walked round the Jayls of <hi>London,</hi> as well as amongst the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in these Parts; besides that Riches of her Liberality with which she relieved the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Irish Protestants:</hi> So that she seemed to be making haste to do all the good that was possible for her, as if she had had a secret Intimation that there was but a small Portion of time now before her. A slow Decay came to seize on her, while she was yet a great way from Old Age, being but Fifty when she died. She quickly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended that it would make an end of her, and so she set her self diligently to prepare for it.</p>
            <p>I must add one part of her Character, which I think so bright a one, that I am not afraid to rank it among those I have already menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned: She had so great a sense of the Goodness of God to the Nation in the late happy Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65709:18"/>
that she said her <hi>Nunc dimittis</hi> with the more Joy, because she had seen that <hi>Salvation which God hath wrought for us:</hi> She paid one Tax to the Government, with so hearty a Zeal, in offering up many earnest Prayers to God for its Establishment, that if many made so many Free-Will Offerings of that kind as she did, we might hope for a better account of all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Taxes; and a speedy end put to them all: and as she had so true an Affection to this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment her self, so she declared an unalte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Resolution of not bestowing that dear part of her Care, which she did not live to finish, to any but such as she believed were Faithful and Zealous to it.</p>
            <p>But now the Melancholy part is yet before me, I unwillingly go to it, but as the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course leads me, so I may well speak of it, since it was such as agreed with all that had gone before: she felt the Decays of Nature come so fast on her, that she prepared her self to meet her God: She had quite overcome all that unwillingness which so just a desire, as was formerly intimated, had raised in her: She rejoiced in the Will of God, and expressed

so much satisfaction and chearfulness even in her Looks, that it plainly appeared all was calm within: She was no more depressed with uneasy Reflections on her self, but had the Joy of a good Conscience, and the Assurance of the Love and Goodness of God through Jesus Christ, to so high a degree, that she felt not now those unjust Censures with which she alone had sometimes punished her self: For she was the only Person, that, as far as I have been informed, ever thought hardly of herself. Since I could never hear that she had an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, or that ever a considerable Injury was done her by any Person; her prudent, grave and unmedling Temper kept her out of the way of making Enemies, and to this was joyned a special Blessing of God, that preserved her from unjust Malice: Thus for meer want of occasion I could not learn how her Charity would have wrought towards an Enemy that had injured her in any sort: She continued during the Course of her Sickness, not only to have the Prayers of the Church said by her, but was very often, indeed almost con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly, observed to be raising up her Soul to God: She had resolved to fit her self for her

last Passage, with the great <hi>Viaticum</hi> of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, but Nature sunk all at once, and so fast that she could only communicate inwardly; yet though she could not end her Life with that most solemn Act of Church-Communion, She desired that Character of dying in the Churches Peace, that is given in <hi>Absolution,</hi> which she received with much devout Joy: At last she broke Prison, and left a feeble and exhausted Body, and is now entered into the <hi>Joy of her Lord,</hi> into that <hi>Rest</hi> to which she was so long aspiring, and of which she had felt so many ravishing Fore-tastes in her way to it. There she is now, in the Fellowship of Angels, and in the Presence of God, where she will remain, till the restitution of all things, that this her now forsaken Body shall be changed and be made meet for her to return to it, and to dwell in it for ever.</p>
            <p>And for her Memory, <hi>let her own Works praise her,</hi> and make her Name to be <hi>as Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment poured forth.</hi> May all in these Parts, that have either observed her Deportment, or felt the effects of her Charity, honour her, or rather Religion that made her to be what she tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

was, even a publick Blessing to the whole Countrey. Look through all the Companies of the gay Libertines, and see what you can find among them all compared to that which Religion wrought in her, and then acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that <hi>This is the Salt of the Earth, and the Light of the World.</hi> May all that hear of her, rise up and call her Blessed; and by a noble E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation, study to imitate the Vertues that shined so fair in her: May the great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily that is to succeed to her Seat, so far follow her steps, that they may dry up the Tears which do now flow so plentifully for her loss: May her noble Children answer the honour of being hers, and the Obligations that lie on them by the Example that they saw in her, and the Education that they received from her: And may he whom she loved and esteemed so highly, carry still with him so ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a sense of all the excellent Things that he observed and admired in her, that according to her last Words to him, <hi>Though they are now parted, since it was the Will of God that it must be so, yet they may meet again never to be separated, but to live eternally happy in that Fulness of Ioy, and in those Pleasures which are for evermore:</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:65709:20"/>
And in conclusion, May the Example she has set, and the Good she has done, be ever cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated; may it recommend true Religion to the World; <hi>Mark the Upright, and behold the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, for their latter End is Peace.</hi> To which God in his Mercy bring us all in his good and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Time.</p>
