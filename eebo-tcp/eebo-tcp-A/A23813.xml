            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N theſe words (though I ſay it not) ſome may, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance, fancy a proper Emblem of the Times; for here is the Inferiour warring againſt the Superiour, the Lower houſe againſt the Higher, the Members againſt the Minde, and, which is ſomewhat more, both pretend a legall Combate, both plead the Law is on their ſide; for the Members, as well as the Mind, pretend a Law, Law againſt Law; <hi>I finde a Law in my Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers warring againſt the Law of my Minde</hi>; ſo that both Mind and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers warring, give out, and boaſt they have Law for it, whileſt each ſeek the deſtruction of other, they both profeſs, as legall, to juſtifie their proceedings.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:94606:3"/>In the grand Difference and ſad Combuſtions of theſe dayes, no Man (I ſuppoſe) will hold a private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be a competent Arbitratour; and yet in this great Diſſenſion and Mutiny between Mind and Members, between Fleſh and Spirit (I conceive) there is no man ſo little intereſſed, but it concerns him neerly to be able to ſay in which of theſe is the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Power, it concerns every of us to be able to ſay whether it be in the power of the Mind, or the Members to propound a Law; whether it be in the power of the Mind or the Members to denounce a War; whether the Mind or the Members ought in this caſe, to have the <hi>Negative,</hi> or the Over-ruling Voice.</p>
            <p>For, How ſhall it be found poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to compound this difference? How in this War can we poſſibly be able to ſay or determine on which ſide we ought to be? (for <hi>Neutralls</hi> in this fight no men living can be) Whether we ought to ſide with the Mind or the Members? Whether the law of the ſupremeſt or of the loweſt portion of the ſoul ought to ſway the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94606:3"/>
whole man? This (ſay we) cannot, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it evidently ſhal appear in whether of theſe God hath placed this Power.</p>
            <p>For, if the Members have the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, if they muſt give the Law, it is then Rebellion in the Mind not to be ruled, or to war againſt them; But if the Mind have this preheminence, if Law and War ſhall prove only at her diſpoſe, 'tis then Rebellion in the Members, not to be captive at her Will, not to be guided by her Law, not to lay down Arms whenſoever ſhe commandeth. So that the main buſineſſe in this Text is too too like the diſcourſe of theſe dayes, point of Prerogative, Supremacy, Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy; for this the Members would have, this they claim, this they war for; and this the Mind will not aſſent unto. For,</p>
            <p>This ſhe challenges as her Royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as her Crown and Dignity, as her Right, and inſeparable Authority; This ſhe claims, and profeſſeth to hold from God; with this ſhe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, that ſhe, and ſhe only, is by God entruſted; yea, that ſhe is in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence bound to plant, not only a guard
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94606:4"/>
about her perſon, but being as the text implies, the Members are firſt in arms, ſhe is alſo bound to muſter up all the Forces ſhe can, to the ſubverſion and utter extirpation of what Law ſoever is enacted, or of what war ſoever ſhall be raiſed or commenced againſt the Mind: Now whether Mind or Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers can in this caſe produce beſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, the ſacred records of Scripture will clearly manifeſt; in them we ſhall impartially ſee which doth uſurp, and which uſurpeth not; which may raiſe war, and which (without apparent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion) may not ſtir a foot; which law we muſt, and which <hi>e contra</hi> we muſt not be ruled by. <hi>I finde a law in my Members,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Law and War are points of great conſequence: as then in high Courts points of that nature uſe to be; even ſo in the diſcuſſing of this Text ſhall we proceed. Firſt we ſhall put it to the Queſtion:</p>

               <note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> God without doubt is the originall of all power, of his fulneſſe it is, that every thing which hath power, hath the power it hath; for that man is ſuperiour to the beaſt of the field, and not they to him; it therefore only is, becauſe it pleas'd the Lord to give Man <hi>Power and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion</hi> over them, and not them over him. Or that Man, and not Woman,<note place="margin">Gen. 1 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> is the nobler ſex; that the Man over the Wife, and not the Wife over the Husband, hath the ruling or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding power, this is alſo from the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94606:5"/>
diſpoſition of the Almighty, becauſe to the firſt of all Wives he was pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſay,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.16.</note> 
               <hi>Thy deſire ſhall be ſubject to thine Husband, and he ſhall rule over thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether then of the grand Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders in the Text? Whether the Minde or Members ought to have the prehemimence and the ſuperior power? This we muſt learn from him, who is the fountain of all power, and the firſt ordainer of all Diſparity; for what he hath given to the Members, the Members muſt have, and what he hath allotted to the Mind, the Mind muſt not be deprived of; where the power of Law, and the power of War hath by God been placed, that is the moſt proper ſeat, there we muſt maintain, there look for it.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of times, when it pleaſed God to create the World, we ſhall read that he therefore made Beaſts to be ſubordinate, and under Man,<note place="margin">Gen. 1.27.28.</note> becauſe after his own <hi>Image,</hi> and according to his own <hi>Likeneſſe</hi> cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated he Man. Now between Mind and Members there is a much what like proportionable diſtinction, for as the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94606:5"/>
Beaſts and Brutes of the field, even ſo the Members, that is, the <hi>Paſſions, Fleſh,</hi> and <hi>lower parts of</hi> Man, they are wholly led by Senſe, and are in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare unto the Mind, no better then brutiſh, and void of underſtanding. As then man, by reaſon of his being created in the likeneſſe of God, is therefore ſuperiour over the beaſt of the field: even ſo for as much as the Mind is that, wherein man is made like unto God, and the Members, thoſe portions or paſſions by which man agreeth, and is like to Brutes, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt the Mind be ſuperiour to the Members, and have like power over them, as Man hath dominion over the Beaſt of the field.</p>
            <p>For as theſe two, Senſe, and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, make the ſpecificall difference between Man and Beaſt, even ſo doth it between Mind and Members; the Mind is that part of the ſoul in which God placed Reaſon; Underſtanding, Judgement, that part of the ſoul in which Grace, freedome of will, and choice of good is fixed and ſeated; whereas on the other ſide, by the Members we are to underſtand either
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94606:6"/>
the outward Senſes, and corporall Members of the body; the ſenſual ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, whether Concupiſcible, or Ira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcible; that is, all our Paſſions and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, ſuch as are, <hi>fear, joy, wrath, love, hope, grief,</hi> or the like. In a word, all whatſoever (which is indeed the <hi>Totum</hi> and all) all that we have (and may find the like in Brutes, all ſuch) whether Paſſions, or Deſires, or Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, they are compriſed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended under this word [Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.]</p>
            <p>If then Man himſelf, becauſe he is the Image of God, is therefore made ſuperiour to the Beaſts which have no underſtanding; certainly then that part of man, in which this ſimilitude or likeneſſe doth conſiſt, that power and portion of the ſoul, in which this Image of God is, that muſt needs be the ſupremeſt, nobleſt, and chief com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding portion, in that doubtleſſe (if in any) there muſt reſide the power of Law, War, and direction in all proceedings.</p>
            <p>Now the Apoſtle plainly tels us, the <hi>New man</hi> (that is, that part of man which beareth the Image of his Maker,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94606:6"/>
and the likeneſs of his God) is that portion of the ſoul which is capable of <hi>Knowledge,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Col. 3.10. Eph. 3.24.</note> capable of <hi>Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and true holineſſe.</hi> And this muſt needs be the <hi>mind of man,</hi> for the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and Members they cannot riſe to ſo high a pitch; hinder they oft both may, and do, but lead or guide they cannot, into the paths of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Col.</hi> 3.5. You have theſe words, <hi>Mortifie your Members which are upon earth.</hi> The power of life and death can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be in any other but the ſupreme hand; whereas then the ſpirit of God ſaith, <hi>Mortifie your Members,</hi> whereas it puts a kind of killing power (and that over the Members too) this manifeſtly infers the mind to be the ſuperiour fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty; yea, the Mind is that in which God hath placed the power of both Law and War.</p>
            <p>Again, if (as before I have proved) <hi>Eve</hi> was therefore ſubject unto <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> becauſe ſhe once daring to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, miſled her husband; then for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, the Affections, Senſes, Members, they muſt all be captivated and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Mind, for they never lead,

but they miſguide the mind, they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver counſell, but (as we very well phraſe it) they <hi>Tranſport</hi> the ſoul. That this our Kingdome is not now, as in our ſtate of <hi>more innocency</hi> it was wont to be (a <hi>pleaſing paradiſe</hi>) that now ſo many Swords are drawn, and ſo many ſluces of bloud let open; is not this becauſe we have (even yet) too many uxorious <hi>Adams?</hi> becauſe we have yet too many that ſuffer their <hi>Eves</hi> to lead them? or, to give it in the phraſe, and bounds of my Text, is it not becauſe things are managed rather by diſaffected paſſions, then by Law and Conſcience, rather by jarring Members then a compoſed Mind?</p>
            <p>The Scripture aſſureth, if the blind lead the blind (both will at length precipitate) both will fall into the ditch; the eye and light of the ſoul is the mind of man, in it and it only ſhineth the light of grace; all the Affections, Paſſions, and carnall De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, they are as ſo many Clouds, darkning and eclipſing this bleſſed light, and therefore if by them we ſhall ſuffer our ſelves to be led, if we ſhall ſquare our actions by their Law,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94606:7"/>
and order all our doings to give them content, we ſhall too late finde we have followed a blind guide, and that both Mind and Members muſt infallibly pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in this courſe.</p>
            <p>In the firſt <hi>verſ.</hi> of the following <hi>Ch.</hi> they who are in Chriſt Jeſus, they who in him would be found without condemnation, they muſt walk, not <hi>after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit:</hi> a plain evidence, that not the Paſſions, Luſts and Affections, not the Fleſh, and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers thereof, but the Spirit (that is the mind of man endowed with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit) that is it that muſt lead the way, that is it that muſt give the Law and Rule of walking; we muſt not walk after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit; not after the Members, but according to the Mind.</p>
            <p>Ecclus. 37.16. <hi>Let Reaſon go before every Enterpriſe, and Counſell before every action.</hi> That part and portion of the ſoul, in which God hath pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Reaſon, Counſell, Conſcience, Grace, that is it which muſt give di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to every Enterpriſe; our judgment, and not our luſts, our Mind, and not our Members, which have
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94606:8"/>
the power of Law and War. Paſs we then to the ſecond Conſiderable, let us ſee what is the Law of the Mind, and what is the Law of the Members.</p>
            <p>The Law of the mind is indeed no other but the Law of God, for <hi>I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the Law of God concerning the inward Man.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſe 22.</note> The inward Man, that is the Mind, Spirit, and better part of man, that acknowledging (like a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch) no ſuperior but God only, will not yeild to any but Gods Law, and therefore ſaith the regenerate mind, <hi>I delight in the Law of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Law of the Members, that is indeed rather a tumultuous Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance then a Law, it is rather a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinous Enforcement then a legall Courſe; it is, ſaith the Apoſtle plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">Verſe 25.</note> the <hi>Law of Sin,</hi> a Law which hath nothing of a Law in it, for it is indeed the breach of all Law, it is ſin (ſaith St. <hi>Paul</hi>) and yet becauſe the Members have ſo voted it, it muſt be called a Law, I ſee (ſaith the Text) <hi>Another Law in my Members.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Another Law,</hi> a Law clean contrary to the Law of the Mind; a Law (I may well ſay) clean contrary to the Law
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94606:8"/>
of God: For, as in all Monarchies, it is the Law and Order of God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty that Subjects receive from, and not give unto their Soveraigne Laws; even ſo it is the Law of God, the mind unto the members, not the members unto the minde preſcribe a Law: all our ſenſes, all our members, all our actions, and all our thoughts are bound to follow her guidance, they muſt come and go, do and ſuffer, when and what ſhe preſcribeth.</p>
            <p>Sure I am, it hath been reſolv'd of old (but wanting books I cannot cite the Authors) in matters of high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence and concernment, that they who are bound to obey, are not ſo much to attend the reaſon as the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of a command; the Subject is not bound to ſift his Soveraign, for if he were, I ſee not how it could be ſaid,<note place="margin">Prov. 25 3.</note> 
               <hi>The Kings heart can no man ſearch out</hi>: yea very good proof I have to ſay, our Saviour commanded St. <hi>Peter</hi> to do what he underſtood not,<note place="margin">Job. 13.7.</note> 
               <hi>What I do</hi> (ſaith the Maſter) <hi>thou knoweſt not now,</hi> and yet, under a fearfull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, he urged his Obedience. And indeed were it not thus between
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94606:9"/>
mind and Members, were not the ſenſes and affections to obey the mind till they were ſatisfyed, and ſaw reaſon for it; if that old ſaying be true, <hi>Amare &amp; ſapere ipſi Jovi non datur,</hi> that luſt and wiſdome can never conſiſt together, then for certain no exorbitant paſſion would ever become obedient and plia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the ſoul.</p>
            <p>But indeed, ſo abſolute a Monarch is the mind to the ſoul of man, that if any one affection, any one ſenſe, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or member ſhall dare to do any things againſt her judgement and her reſolve, that Perſon is really diſaffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, that Senſe infallibly malignant, and that member without all queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on delinquent in the Court of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: For look what is ſaid of a King, and by a King, the ſame is very ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliable to the ſoveraignty of the mind,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 3.4.</note> 
               <hi>Where the word of a King is, there is power.</hi> Where the Mind hath ſaid the word, there is no power in Man, to warrant the gain-ſaying of it; and if the following Interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in that verſe muſt poſitively be read, that is, —<hi>No man may ſay unto the King, What dost thou?</hi> Then
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94606:9"/>
is this regall preheminence a moſt pertinent explication of the Minds ſuperexcellency; for to it, no Senſe, no Member, no Paſſion, no Affection may ſay, What doſt thou? Yea, ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely hath God ſubjected the whole man to the direction and Law of the Minde, that albeit the Mind miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guides, albeit ſhe iſſues forth an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which will deſtroy the Members, yea, and the whole man to boot: yet <hi>Ment erronea ligat,</hi> yet for as much as the Minde or Conſcience is the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Judicatory in men, for as much as the Mind is (as we have ſworne our Soveraigne is) the <hi>only ſupreme,</hi> ſin we needs muſt, ſhould we not follow her even in a wrong direction, much more if we adhere not cloſe, whilſt yet her Law is the Law of God, and all her Judgements conſonant to his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. In a word, the Law of the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Mind is to go before, to guide and order even the whole man in the paths of righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>Now the Law of the Members, that is (as the Text ſpeaks) <hi>Another Law,</hi> that is a clean contrary courſe: for whereas it is the legall and divine
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:94606:10"/>
prerogative of the mind to give Law unto the whole man: the Members finding this a curbe unto their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and a main ſuppreſſion of their deſires, they ſtrive by all means poſſible to ſubvert this Order, to change this Government, to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw this Fundamentall Law; for they being carnall will not endure a ſpirituall Governour, they being ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, will not abide that the minde being but one, ſhould over-rule them, and therefore (as if it were their Charter, their priviledge, and their right) they ſtrive to give law unto their mind, and reſolve to wage a war, if ſhe be not led by them.</p>
            <p>James 4.1. <hi>From whence are Wars and Contentions amongſt you? are they not hence, even of your luſts that fight in your Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The lower Houſe of this Naturall Parliament in Man, conſiſts of many Members, of many Luſts, of many diſordered paſſions; all which, though they Combine, Covenant, and ſo farre agree, as to warre againſt the Minde, yet they have alſo their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall deſignes, and their particular
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:94606:10"/>
ends; for as when there was no King in <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Judg. 17.6</note> 
               <hi>Every man did what ſeemed good in his own eyes</hi>; even ſo, to the end that every man may walke as his Luſts lead him, that every Luſt may be a Law unto it ſelf, therefore as againſt a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon enemy, the Luſts and Members are continually warring againſt the Mind.</p>
            <p>Nor only ſo, but as St. <hi>James</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, <hi>They fight in our Members too</hi>; The Luſts war againſt, and quarrell one with another; and indeed no wonder, for amongſt equals who ſhould command? who obey? Why ſhould not Wrath have as much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand as Joy? Why not Joy as much as Love? Why not Love as much as any? That Member which deſires a Monopoly of pleaſure, wars againſt that, which ſtands upon Honour and Repute: and that Member, whoſe deſigne is Honour, endures not that which is bent upon Wealth and Riches. The Luſts of Man (even like contrary winds) they rage and ſwell one againſt the Minde, they admit a league; they are all like thoſe wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94606:11"/>
Citizens (in this they agree) <hi>We will not have this Man reigne over us.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 19.14.</note> The Law of the Minde ſhall not rule, regulate or order us; ſo that, as St. <hi>James</hi> hath taught us, even thence are Wars and Contentions, becauſe our Luſts fight in our Members.</p>
            <p>Eccleſ. 10.7. <hi>I have ſeen</hi> (ſaith Solomon) <hi>Servants on Horſes, and Princes walking as Servants on the ground.</hi> That ſight of <hi>Solomon,</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that which the Mind and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers differ and war about; for the Members, they, though Servants, would be on Horſes; Yea, they would have the Mind, though their Prince, to walke and wait upon them. And this is apparent from the words <hi>next following</hi> in the Text, for that which St. <hi>Paul</hi> complaines of, (though it bear the name of a Law) himſelf ſheweth was flat Tyranny; for the Members endevour to make even a very ſlave of the Mind—I ſee a Law in my Members warring againſt the Law of my Mind, and <hi>leading me Captive</hi> unto the Law of ſinne, which is in my Members [<hi>leading me Captive</hi>] Nothing will content the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94606:11"/>
Members, unleſſe they may captive and enſlave the Mind; and for this I am confident, there are very few of us, but may find in our ſouls, even an experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall proof.</p>
            <p>For, what Paſſion can you imagine in the ſoul, which, whileſt it is predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant, expects not from the Mind, what ſervice and aſſiſtance ſoever it ſhal pleaſe to challenge, yea, the Mind muſt leave all, and give diligent attendance to it only?</p>
            <p>Is the ſoul of any of us enflamed with Malice, and the thirſt of Revenge? Is there a <hi>Mordecai</hi> whom we ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and will have removed from the Kings gate? Doth not this Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſolicite the Mind, to contrive the means, and to lay the plot how this cruelty may be ſatisfyed? Yea, is not the Court full of terror and diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances? Is not the Mind a reſtleſſe wretch? Is ſhe not perpetually vext and moleſted, unleſſe ſhe paſſe what Bill ſoever this Tyrant in that behalf ſhall preſent unto her?</p>
            <p>Or, ſuppoſe Covetouſneſſe and deſire of gain to be predominant, can the Mind be quiet? Will this
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:94606:12"/>
paſſion be ſatisfied with either Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or Conſcience, or any manner of Moderation?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Acts</hi> 5. So Religious was the Princely part, and ſo devout was the Minde of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> that in Judgment and Piety, they thought all they had but a competent Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the Lords ſervice: But when their Members and covetous affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons began to mutiny, when the feare either of future want, or the Carnall and Covetous thought that they had promiſed too much; when theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to buſtle and gather head, when theſe had raiſed a Tumult and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtion in the ſoul; the poor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted Mind, even againſt Honour, Conſcience, yea, to her own undoing, is forced to repeal what ſhe had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore enacted: and though no leſſe then the robbing of God was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in it, aſſent ſhe gives to their violent importunity. And therefore very lively is St. <hi>Pauls</hi> expreſſion, <hi>I ſee a Law in my Members, leading me Captive to the Law of ſinne.</hi> Nothing can or will content the Members: No Law, no Peace, unleſſe they may
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:94606:12"/>
lead the minde Captive, and make her the Soveraigne become a ſlave unto their Luſts. Paſs we therefore to the third conſiderable, <hi>viz. Whether it be not damnable Rebellion to diſobey or reſiſt that part which God hath inveſted with this power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Of Rebellion indefinitely <hi>Samuel</hi> hath ſaid, it is as the ſin of <hi>Witchcraft,</hi> a ſin moſt abominable before God. Nor indeed have I yet met with any, who queſtion the guilt or <hi>Damnabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> of this crime, <hi>uno ore</hi> (for ought I know) all men in this agree: That which is indeed Rebellion, is a crying ſin, and a moſt damnable deſigne; all the difference and doubt is, what indeed Rebellion is, and what that power is which is damnable to reſiſt.</p>
            <p>I muſt not forget that my text is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Mind and the Members, and that Rebellion at this time concerns me no further, but only as it reſpects the outward and the inward man, the Monarchy and Government of every regenerate and good ſoul.</p>
            <p>Now for the better ſtating and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicating of this, I have obſerved
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:94606:13"/>
from Scripture, that every Jar, War, and oppoſition is not Rebellion; for Rebellion it was not, for the Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> and the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to wage War againſt each other; Rebellion it is not for Subject to conteſt with Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, neither is it a Rebellious act for the Soveraigne to Tyrannize over, and oppreſſe his people.</p>
            <p>For as by Scripture phraſe, I am warranted to ſpeak, Rebellion is ever the oppoſing of ſome higher power, and in ſpeciall of that power which by the Ordinance of God, they (who rebell, oppoſe and reſiſt) are bound to obey and ſuffer under; ſo that it is an act of Rebellion to withdraw from, or ſtand againſt that power, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which till ſome difference, diſtaſte, opportunity or grudge aroſe, we ever held our ſelves bound to live and to be governed by.</p>
            <p>For, let the ground of <hi>Iſraels</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt from <hi>Rehoboam</hi> their naturall King be what it may be, (ſure I am) when they ſo did, the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Iſrael rebelled againſt the houſe of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 King. 12.19.</note> Let the caſe be what it may be, when <hi>Edom</hi> deſerted <hi>Judah</hi> and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:94606:13"/>
made a King over themſelves, the Spirit of God ſaith,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 22.8.</note> 
               <hi>Edom rebelled from under the hand of Judah</hi>; yea, and albeit ſome countenance the fact, and ſeek by a Religious pretence to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ant the attempt, yet, when the Citizens of <hi>Libnah</hi> turned from their lawfull (though Idolatrous) King <hi>Jehoram,</hi> the Scripture phraſe in the <hi>Geneva</hi> Tranſlation is,<note place="margin">Verſ. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Then did Libnah rebell</hi>; whence to me it ſeems very clear, that we are bound under perill of Rebellion and the guilt thereof, to obey or ſuffer under that, whether it be Part, Perſon, or Faculty, which God hath inveſted with the power of giving, or preſcribing Law un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us.</p>
            <p>And indeed if you pleaſe to rely upon the <hi>Geneva</hi> Tranſlation, I then needed not to have thus wheeled about; for though our laſt Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion read it, <hi>I ſee a Law in my Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> Warring <hi>againſt the Law of my Mind,</hi> it is there ſaid, <hi>I ſee a Law in my Members</hi> Rebelling <hi>againſt the Law of my Mind.</hi> And indeed from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed inſtances it ſeemeth very clear, that all Warre againſt that power
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:94606:14"/>
which ought by Gods Ordinance to be obeyed, is indeed Rebellion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.23. St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath delivered it as a rule beyond exception, <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is not of Faith is ſin.</hi> Now that ſin (if deliberately done) cannot but be <hi>Rebellion</hi>: for, Faith being in that place no other thing then the Law of the Mind, then the Judgement of Reaſon and Conſcience; Faith being in that Text no other thing, but the Order and Direction of the <hi>Suprem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt</hi> power; for a man not to do accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to theſe directions, not to obey and be ruled by the <hi>higheſt</hi> Commander in the Soul; for a man not to ſubmit to the Mind, which is to him Gods Vicegerent, is indeed to rebell at once, both againſt God, and his Heavenly Ordinance.</p>
            <p>And in this reſpect, it ſeemeth to me, that God in holy Writ, doth ſo oft call ſinning <hi>Iſrael,</hi> a Rebellious people; a people who would rather be led by their own luſts, then by his Law, by their own affections, then by their own mind.</p>
            <p>Ezek. 2.5. <hi>Son of Man</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>I ſend thee to the Children of Iſrael, to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:94606:14"/>
a Rebellious Nation that hath rebelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They in Gods eſteem, Rebelled even againſt him, againſt God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who would neither ſubmit to that power which God gave his Prophets, nor yet to that wherewith he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed their minds, for the due order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Affections, Actions, and endevours of all turbulent and inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Members.</p>
            <p>Gal. 5.17. <hi>The Fleſh luſteth contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit contrary to the Fleſh.</hi> Fleſh and Spirit, Mind and Members, they are ever contrary and one againſt the other. War (as will appear in the next point) will ever be between them, for their deeds and their deſignes are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. But as I never read, neither can conceive, that a King, compared to his Subjects, can <hi>be a Rebell</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do I conceive it imaginable, how the Warre waged by the Mind a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Members, can be Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; nor on the contrary, how that which they raiſe againſt the mind, can poſſibly be any other: For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Superiour and Inferiour, there
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:94606:15"/>
cannot poſſibly be a War waged, but Rebellion it muſt be, and how the higher powers can be guilty of this crime, I am yet to learne. Whether then it be in the body Politick, or in the naturall Polity and Order of every particular, every ſoul muſt be Subject to the higher, or, as the Originall, <hi>the ſupper-excelling power</hi>: As the Subjects to the King, even ſo at leaſt muſt the Members be to the Mind; which to make the more clear and evident, we will paſſe to the laſt conſiderable, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> that is the <hi>Reſult or reſolution of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, viz.</hi> Whether a man ought to be guided by his Mind, or by his Members, yea, whether a man is not bound in Conſcience to War againſt the lower and inferiour of them.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his Tract of Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on tels us, there was one <hi>Tyribaſtus,</hi> who, when he ſhould have been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by the <hi>Perſian,</hi> drew his Cemiter, and (as he was a valiant man of his hands) defended himſelf valiantly; but as ſoon as they who came to lay hands on him cryed out, and proteſted, that they were to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tach him in the Kings Name, and by Commiſſion from his Majeſty, he laid down his weapon aforeſaid immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and offered both his hands to be bound and pinioned.</p>
            <p>An example ſtrongly convincing me, that even the Law and light of Nature, were it not clouded with carnall and perverſe affections, even that glimmering light were enough to teach the Mind, that reſiſt we may not againſt Gods ordinance. <hi>Tyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſtus</hi> threw down his Cemiter, and apprehends, in the very Name and Authority of a King, a Majeſty, and

This I am ſure was and is the Law of the mind.</p>
            <p>But the Law of our Sacrilegious and ungodly members is ſuch, that it will not allow, no not to God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a <hi>Property,</hi> nor the Church to be a Sanctuary for its own goods: like the Roman Pagan preſidents, they ſeem to profeſſe the Son of <hi>Mary</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to be ſerved in coſtly veſſels

            <p>Eccleſ. 18.30, 31. <hi>Go not after thy luſts, but refrain thy ſelf from thine Appetites, (for) if thou giveſt thy Soul the deſires that pleaſe her, ſhe will make thee a laughing ſtock to thine enemies that maligne thee.</hi> The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy way to captivate the Mind, and to bring its Soveraignty under the power of Malignant Enemies; is to give way to thy Luſts, and to let the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers preſcribe a Law unto thee; let them but have their deſires, and thou ſhalt ſoon be made a laughing-ſtock to thy Enemies round about thee: It is very likely, as the Devill to our Saviour, thy Members may promiſe thee a condition moſt glorious:<note place="margin">Mat. 4.8.</note>

But if thou once fall down and worſhip, if thou wilt ſuffer thy Mind to proſtitute, and yeild up it ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Members, they will ſoon (in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtead of a glorious ſtate) bring thee to an ungracious ſervitude. They will not allow thy Mind a Negative in any thing, for the ambition of ſin is, to <hi>reigne</hi> in our mortall Bodies.</p>
            <p>What then muſt the Mind do? without doubt Warre it muſt; for as therefore the Inferiour may not War, becauſe it hath a Superiour to appeal unto: even ſo on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, for as much as the Mind is the Supreme, War ſhe may, yea War ſhe muſt againſt the Members; for ſhe for them, not they for her, muſt be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God.</p>

of this world; a Kingdom he had, but ſaith he, <hi>My Kingdome is not of this world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now for the better explication of this aſſertion, we ſhall proceed by theſe three degrees:</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Kingdome of Chriſt is over this world.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Chriſt hath a Kingdome in this world.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Kingdome of Chriſt is not of this world.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>The Kingdom of Chriſt is over this world.</hi> Pſal. 99.1. <hi>The Lord is King, be the People never ſo impatient.</hi> The Lord is King, even our bleſſed Lord and Saviour, and that not only as God,<note place="margin">Mat. 28.18</note> but even as Man alſo. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is ſaid that <hi>All power is given to him both in Heaven and in Earth</hi>; Clear it is that he hath, and that he hath as Man too, power and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion even over the whole World. For being it is ſaid, <hi>All power,</hi> the Power of Soveraignty and Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on cannot be exempted: And, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is ſaid, <hi>All power is given,</hi> This ſhewes in what capacity he hath this power, to wit, in that by which he
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:94606:26"/>
is lower then the Father,<note place="margin">Iſa. 49.</note> in that by which he is made capable to receive <hi>ex dono,</hi> to take of gift, in that by which he is become the Saviour of the world. So that indeed the ſame perſon, who was the Saviour, he is alſo the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign of mankinde.</p>
               <p>And this may not improbably teach us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that Kings, his Vice-gerents, they are proportionably <hi>Saviours,</hi> as well as <hi>Soveraignes,</hi> nurſing Fathers as well as potent Princes: So that to withdraw from the protection of a Soveraigne, it is to deſpiſe and throw off a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. He who was the Saviour of the world, he is alſo King of Kings, and as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>The only Potentate.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.15.</note> And he under whoſe wings we have been ſecurely ſafe, let the ſad want of him now ſay, it was <hi>Chriſtus Domini,</hi> the Lords Anointed, the only Potentate, the only ſupreme Governour of this Kingdome.</p>
               <p>Or, take the point thus, Is it ſo that he, whoſe Kingdome is not of this world, hath for all that Power and Dominion over all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of this world? Maugre then all the deſignes, plots, jealouſies and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:94606:27"/>
fears, that Devill or Man can ſet on foot; Our Lord the King ſhall reach his end,<note place="margin">Pſal. 2 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Our Lord the King ſhall break their Bonds in ſunder, and caſt their Cords from him.</hi> For to him all power is given.</p>
               <p>Indeed if in the peruſall of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, we ſhould ſtand to obſerve the <hi>Induſtrious malice</hi> of his Enemies, we ſhall find their plot and deſigne was, <hi>even root and branch to cut him off</hi>; they endevoured to kill him with <hi>ſhame,</hi> and to bury him with <hi>Infamy:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 27.64</note> For when as a Malefactor they had put him to death, their greateſt care and thought of heart was, to prevent his Reſurrection. And therefore their great ſuit to <hi>Pilate</hi> is, <hi>Command that the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre be made ſure.</hi> Rebels are afraid of a King, though he be in his grave.</p>
               <p>And indeed they had cauſe ſo to be, for though his Kingdom was not of, yet I have ſhewed unto you it was over this world, over <hi>their Deſignes,</hi> over <hi>their Plots,</hi> over <hi>their Malice</hi>; in ſo much that you may read, that very ſtone, which they rejected, it
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:94606:27"/>
became the <hi>corner</hi> ſtone; And that very Soveraign, whom they <hi>ignominiouſly</hi> laid in the grave, and thought to ſecure by Souldiers, he had (witneſſe thoſe very Souldiers) a <hi>glorious Reſurrection,</hi> ſo that indeed there is no conteſting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Soveraignty.</p>
               <p>As the Kingdom of Chriſt is over <hi>this</hi> world, even ſo Chriſt, whoſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is not of this world, yet hath a Kingdom <hi>in this</hi> world.</p>
               <p>If you peruſe the Goſpell, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but finde that even then, when the major part, and prevailing party was moſt againſt him; even then, this Soveraigne had ſome <hi>Loyall</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, he had in his loweſt condition ſome, who though timorouſly, yet moſt <hi>cordially</hi> ſtuck unto him; ſo that he alwayes had a Kingdom, even in this world. And this is apparent from that laſt ſolemne prayer of his, where when he prayed for theſe, for theſe who were Loyall and true of heart, his Petition runs thus,<note place="margin">Joh. 17 15.</note> 
                  <hi>I pray not that thou ſhouldeſt take them out of the world:</hi> Out of the world he would not have his Subjects taken, for though <hi>not of</hi> the world, he was reſolved, and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:94606:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
doth to this hour preſerve a Kingdome <hi>in this</hi> world.</p>
               <p>And this the <hi>Jews,</hi> his Adverſaries, did too well perceive; for ſuch was his <hi>goodneſſe,</hi> ſuch his <hi>meekneſſe,</hi> ſuch his <hi>charity,</hi> that he did indeed draw all men after him.</p>
               <p>Whileſt he was yet at liberty, and the people might have acceſſe unto him, they flocked unto him from all places,<note place="margin">Mat. 19.</note> and <hi>he healed</hi> them; Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes followed him, and he without reſpect to what part they took, touched and cured ſuch as came unto him. In ſo much that his Malignant perſecutors are not aſhamed to vote what was done, <hi>digito Dei,</hi> with the finger of God, to be done by Beelze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bub the Prince of Devils: not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to ſay,<note place="margin">Joh. 11.48.</note> 
                  <hi>If we let him alone, all men will believe on him.</hi> If we let him alone, the people will leave us; if we let him alone, he will recover his king<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And unlikely it is not, but the conceit of this <hi>Epicurean</hi> paradiſe, may be a cauſe that many run ſuch mad couſes as they do, confidently believing they ſhall preſently have a Kingdom in this world.</p>

                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:94606:30"/>Firſt, My Kingdome is not <hi>de mundo,</hi> Not of the world.</p>
               <p>There is a great deal of difference being <hi>of</hi> the world, and <hi>in</hi> the world. <hi>Abraham, Iſaac, Jacob,</hi> and all the Holy men in thoſe dayes. <hi>Peter, Paul, Nathaniel,</hi> and all the Saints of their time; theſe were as much in the world, as <hi>Cain, Eſau, Manaſſes, Judas</hi>: Chriſt himſelf was as much <hi>in</hi> the world as any ſinner was, but <hi>of</hi> the world nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they nor he were.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In</hi> the world then, are all thoſe who live in the world, whether good or bad, whether Rebellious, or righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous: But <hi>of</hi> the world thoſe only are, who conforme themſelves unto the world; for as it is one thing to live <hi>in</hi> the Fleſh, and another worſe thing to live <hi>according</hi> to the Fleſh:<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> Even ſo it is one thing to live in the world, and a far worſe thing to live ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the World; for as they who live <hi>according to the fleſh,</hi> deny no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to themſelves which the fleſh requireth, but ſatisfie their luſts in the deſires thereof: Even ſo, ſuch as live according to the world, ſuch who are men of this world, they ſo live unto

it, that they know <hi>no King but the world</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For, they will obey nothing, profeſſe nothing, defend nothing, but what pleaſeth the world; Let their King be never ſo much vilifyed and diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, let him be aſſaulted with Swords and Staves, let him be arraign'd, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd, and nayled to a Croſſe; The men of this world they are reſolv'd to hold their own, they are reſolv'd they wil not part with their intereſt for his Honour.</p>
               <p>Whereas then our Saviour and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne tels <hi>Pilate, My Kingdome is not of this world</hi>: The meaning of this expreſſion cleerly is, my Subjects are not men worldly minded, my Kingdome is not of ſuch who are wedded to the world. As if he had thus ſaid to <hi>Pilate,</hi> —Whereas I ſtand here accuſed for the affectation of a <hi>Crown,</hi> and for being no friend to <hi>Caeſar</hi>; the truth is, there need be no ſuch jealouſies, or fears of me; for nor do I, nor mine, affect ſuch a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome as he hath, <hi>My Kingdome is not of this world.</hi> My Kingdome is not of ſuch, who ſtudy either for the Honour, the Pleaſure, or the Profits

               <p>Mat. 16.24. <hi>If any man will come after me, let him deny himſelf.</hi> And <hi>who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever will ſave his life ſhall loſe it, and whoſoever will loſe his life for my ſake, ſhall find it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He who here ſaith, My Kingdome is not of this world, he teacheth his Subjects a Self-denying Ordinance, teaching them as ſo many reſolute Souldiers, to renounce and dye unto the world. So that indeed the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt is of ſuch only, who look neithe upon life nor lively<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, when the honour and glory of their Saviour and Soveraigne is at ſtake.</p>
               <p>Thoſe then who violate his Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes by their Ordinances, thoſe who prefer their Votes to his Lawes, thoſe who counterfeit his Seals, ſubvert his Fundamentall Government, and make his Sacraments of no effect, ſuch as theſe are not only <hi>in,</hi> but <hi>of</hi> the

               <p>From which words we ſhall deduct and proceed upon theſe three Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations:</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Kingdome of Chriſt hath no need of a Sword to ſet it up.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Where there is ſuch a King there is no <hi>Co-ordination,</hi> no <hi>Medium</hi> between Chriſt and his ſervants.</p>

               <p>Firſt for the firſt, The Kingdome of Chriſt hath no need of a Sword for to ſet it up; for in this the Kingdome of Chriſt differeth from the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

               <p>1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 22. When <hi>David</hi> in his proſecution of his pious intendment had made large proviſion toward the building of a Temple to the Lord, he calling to his Son <hi>Solomon</hi> told him, <hi>My Son, the Word of the Lord came to me ſaying, Thou haſt ſhed bloud abundantly, and haſt made great War</hi>; thou (there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) <hi>ſhall not build a houſe unto my name,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>God would not that the very Type and Figure of the Kingdome of his Son ſhould be erected by a <hi>Sword<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>; yea, though he was otherwiſe a man after <hi>Gods own heart</hi>; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a <hi>Warriour,</hi> becauſe a <hi>Fighter,</hi> though but of the Lords own Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tells, God will not have an houſe

               <p>Certainly then, the way to ſet up Chriſt upon his Throne, the way to enlarge his Kingdome, and advance his Scepter, is not to enter into a Conſpiracy, to ſwear a Covenant, and to take up Armes; for if it ſo were, then were Chriſts Kingdome of this world; for it is the way of the men of this world, by force and fighting, to manage their Deſigns, ſo that they who would put ſuch a Forme upon Chriſts Kingdome, which never <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Indeed, the King of this Kingdome, our bleſſed Lord and Saviour, he hath an Army, but it is of Martyrs: he hath Servants, who ſtrive, and who do defend his Kingdome, but 'tis by their own and not by the bloud of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: he hath Souldiers, and fighting Miniſters, but 'tis not with carnall

               </p>
               <p>1 Cor. 1.23. <hi>Chriſtum praedicamus Crucifixum,</hi> we preach Chriſt Crucifyed. Did ever any Subject, who deſired to make his King glorious, and his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome eminent, publiſh the <hi>infirmities</hi> and preach the <hi>ſhame</hi> of his Soveraign? Did ever Embaſſador for the <hi>glory</hi> of his Maſter, report in forain parts how his Subjects had ſold, vilifyed, baniſh'd and impriſoned their Soveraign? (All too true.)

               </p>
               <p>Now behold, and ſee the wonder: He whoſe Kingdome is not of this world, by a courſe clean contrary to the world, he hath made himſelf the moſt glorious Kingdome in the world; For, not by the Arm of fleſh, but by the Fooliſhneſſe of preaching; not by glorying in his Victories, but in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing

               </p>
               <p>Indeed if we look into the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:94606:35"/>
of his Reign, we ſhall find Swords enough drawn againſt his Subjects: for to have been a Chriſtian, to have profeſt <hi>Loyalty</hi>; it was Malignancy enough, 'twas Capitall, 'twas indeed All. <hi>Bonus vir Cajo-Sejus, modo Chriſtianus; Cajo-Sejus</hi> was a good man, only he was a Chriſtian: and indeed the worſt Tyrants had to object in thoſe days; it only was <hi>their Allegiance,</hi> only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they proteſted, and according to proteſtation ſtuck cloſe to the Lords Anointed.</p>
               <p>Now here again is the wonder of this Kingdom, that <hi>lex nova non vindicat ſe ultore gladio.</hi> Theſe poor oppreſſed Subjects, they did not <hi>combine</hi> and make an Army, they did not <hi>aſsociate</hi> and make an head, they did not <hi>whet</hi> their Swords and make <hi>ready</hi> their Arrowes, but they laid down their lives, they reſign'd up their bodies, they neither feared nor cared what man could do unto them. <hi>Et ſic crevit Eccleſia.</hi> And hence it was that this Kingdom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo ample, hence it was the world became ſo full of worthies, and hence it was that Chriſt came to have <hi>a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that is not of this world.</hi>

               <p>Since Authority hath been diſputed, though the <hi>Word</hi> hath been kept, the <hi>Power</hi> of a King hath been much eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ſo that now we may admit of this diſtinction; a King <hi>Nominall,</hi> and a King <hi>Reall,</hi> a Perſon ſo called, and a Perſonage that is ſo indeed.</p>

nor hath any Nominall King more then his ſhare, and his perſonall inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in the Government.</p>
               <p>Now ſuch a King was not the King in the Text, he was <hi>not only</hi> in Name, but moſt <hi>really,</hi> and in power a King: God his Father, who ſet him upon the holy hill of <hi>Sion,</hi> he joyn'd none in Commiſſion with him, he appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted no <hi>Ephori,</hi> no <hi>five Members,</hi> no <hi>Committees</hi> for to over-ſee him; to him was given <gap reason="foreign">

                  <note place="margin">Iſa. 9.6.</note> the Prince of Peace: He and he only it was that could ſettle his Kingdom in peace: ſo that with ſuch a King as he, impoſſible it is there ſhould be a Co-ordination; as poſſible to have <hi>two</hi> Saviours of the world, as <hi>two</hi> Soveraignes of one and the ſame Kingdome, ſo that he might very well ſay, <hi>My Kingdom,</hi> for he had no compeer, no fellow in it: he might very well ſay, <hi>My Servants,</hi> for no <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall,</hi> he had to fight for him.</p>
               <p>Indeed it is moſt apparent, our King in the Text he had a Councell,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:94606:37"/>
                  <hi>a great Councell,</hi> a Councell inſpired with the holy Ghoſt: He had twelve Apoſtles, yet though there were twelve of them, he was <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſis major,</hi> he was greater then his body, for <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.18. <hi>He is the head of the body</hi>;<note place="margin">Col. 1.18.</note> he is the <hi>Head of his Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And indeed, as the head of no man is ſaid to be the head of the <hi>Arme,</hi> or the head of the <hi>hand,</hi> or the head of any particular member, but the head of the whole, the head of the body; even ſo the King in my Text, he who is ſaid to be the head of his Church, he is not head of this or that particular Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, or of every perſonall body, but he is the head of the whole, as they make one body.</p>
               <p>It is moſt true, every Member may ſay, this is my Head, and every ſubject may ſay, this is my King; but it is the Head, and the Head only, which can ſay, <hi>This is my body</hi>; the King, and the King only who can ſay, <hi>This is my Kingdome.</hi> So that there may be as well two Heads to one Body, as two <hi>co-ordinate Supremes</hi> in one King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. The King in my Text (it is moſt clear) approves no ſuch, where
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:94606:38"/>
he hath to do; for he ſaith perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, <hi>my Kingdome, my Servants,</hi> all but my ſelf are Inferiours, all but my ſelf are Subjects; <hi>If my Kingdome were of this World, my Servants would fight for me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed, if we look upon <hi>the great Councell</hi> of this King, if we look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Apoſtles, we ſhall finde they are in an hot contention, and make <hi>great debate,</hi> who ſhould be the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt among them. For when the King in my Text told them, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.22. <hi>Truly the Sonne of Man goeth</hi>—It preſently followes, <hi>There was ſtrife among them which of them ſhould be counted the greateſt.</hi> Co-ordinate powers they will juſtle: Take away this <hi>one King,</hi> and we ſhall finde none.

For when the

King in my text was but apprehended, and taken away by Souldiers, you ſhall find even of his deareſt ſervants, and of his Boſom Counſellors there was not a man ſtuck unto him.</p>
               <p>So that indeed a Kingdome admits no other then of this Diviſion, <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne</hi> and <hi>Servants, King</hi> and <hi>Subjects</hi>; for take Soveraignty from the King, and the World ſhall ſoon find he will grow a Servant quickly; for as the Diſciples, even ſo al Co-ordinates, they are ambitious to write this ſtile, <hi>my Kingdome, my Servants.</hi> And ſo to the laſt conſiderable.</p>
               <p>How far Subjects are Servants, which according to my Text hath this extent, Servants to defend their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign from both injury and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment: For, ſaith the King in my Text, <hi>If my Kingdome were of this world, my Servants would fight</hi>; and then adds for what, <hi>That I ſhould not be delivered to the Jews.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>My ſervants would fight.</hi> To fight is to hazard Life and Limbe, the deareſt things of this World. To fight, it implieth the leaving of Wife and Children, houſe and home, and to go where the Fight is: So that it may very well be doubted whether thoſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants have done their <hi>Duties,</hi> or thoſe ſubjects diſcharged their <hi>Allegiance,</hi> who have loſt only <hi>the paring</hi> of their nailes, or the <hi>Haire</hi> of their head; I mean nothing but their <hi>extraordinaries,</hi> nothing but their wonted wantonneſſe and fulneſſe for the Redemption of their Soveraign.</p>

If my Kingdome were of this World</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>then would my Servants,</hi> (not plot how to ſave, reſtore, and ſecure themſelves) but <hi>my Servants would fight.</hi> Thoſe who are able and have hearts, they ſhould not ſpend only their <hi>Breath,</hi> but even their <hi>Bloud,</hi> not only their <hi>Eſtates,</hi> but even <hi>themſelves</hi>; when the caſe is ſo ſad, that if they fight not, the King muſt ſuffer. <hi>Were my Kingdome of this world, my ſervants</hi> (ſaith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour) <hi>would fight,</hi> yea <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>The Jews conſidered before they proved <hi>Rebellious,</hi> and did deſpight unto their King; they were the <hi>most glorious</hi> Nation under Heaven, Gods people, a people Honourable at home, and Feared abroad: but when they had ſo far degenerated as to fall foul both upon Gods <hi>Prophets,</hi> and <hi>Gods anointed,</hi> when they <hi>Ston'd</hi> the one, and <hi>Blaſphem'd</hi> the other; from that <hi>time</hi> even unto <hi>this day</hi> they are become the moſt <hi>hatefull</hi> and odious people under Heaven, a people into whoſe hands rather then a King ſhould come, <hi>my ſervants would fight,</hi> ſaith the King in my Text.</p>
               <p>By Jewes in the Text then we may aptly underſtand not <hi>only</hi> the people of the <hi>Jews,</hi> but people of any Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or language whatſoever, that ſhall be <hi>ſo</hi> Jewiſh, as to endevour to make their King <hi>odious,</hi> ſo Jewiſh as to <hi>aſſault, Arraigne,</hi> and <hi>Crucifie</hi> their King; Subjects or Servants ought to fight, rather then to ſuffer their King to be in ſuch hands.</p>

               <p>It is well known there are in the World, who will ſooner fight for a <hi>Mistris</hi> (I had almoſt ſaid a whore)

               <p>To ſpeak then only a word of ſo great a point, I conceive this is a ſure foundation [No man may fight, or venture his life for that, which in cool bloud, judgement and right rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is not dearer then life] and of this nature there are not many things in the World.

               <p>Inſtances might be given (and thoſe not a few) even of Pagans, who, albeit they had no after-hopes, as Chriſtians have, yet for a publick good, for the peace and ſafety of a Kingdome they have dared to die. <hi>Codrus</hi> the Athenian, <hi>Curtius</hi> the Roman, both gave themſelves up for the good of their Country.

preſſeth his judgment for to quit him, I finde no fault in him, no nor yet <hi>Herod.</hi> But whom Malice deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers up, Innocence muſt not acquit; for Envy like Rebellion hath alway a deſigne againſt the perſon; yea, the more worth in the perſon; the more eager is his Perſecution, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.46. when the Officers ſent to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend him, brought this anſwer, <hi>never man ſpake like this man</hi>; his wiſdome and ſufficiency ſo aſtoniſhed them, they were now more then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſet againſt him; when they ſaw ſuch was his perfections, that he was ready to convert and draw all men after him, as it is in <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.50. then as <hi>Cajaphas, ſo they, it is expedient for us that he die the death</hi> for us, who cannot reign if he live; for us, who cannot live, if he do; for us, whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne hath been againſt his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for us, it is expedient that one, yea, this one ſhould die; his Wiſdom, his Innocence, his Perfections, his Integrity; all his excellencies we are to look upon, as ſo many perils, and therefore to <hi>Pilates</hi> propoſall of his Innocency and Integrity, the chief
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:94606:50"/>
Prieſts Officers returne this Acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Crucifie him, Crucifie him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, As by propoſall of his Innocency, even ſo alſo of his ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, <hi>Pilate</hi> ſought his delivery: for whereas in moſt men, there is ſo much naturall compaſſion, that when we ſee a very Malefactor in bitterneſſe of ſpirit, our bowels yerne, and we grow tender; <hi>Pilate</hi> thought to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce an Innocent in ſuch a plight, to ſhew one who had not deſerved a ſtripe, even to ſatisfie them ſo ſcourged, that his bloud might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a mantle to him. <hi>Pilate,</hi> I ſay, thought this, this if any thing might ſave his life, and therefore in this plight he ſaith, <hi>Behold the Man</hi>: but no ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes which are not mortall, no ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings which are not deadly, no bloud but the heart bloud can ſatisfie the malicious; and therefore albeit crown'd with Thorns, and flea'd with Whips, they ſtill cry, <hi>Execution, Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, let him be Crucifyed, let him be Crucifyed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Not only by propoſall of his Innocency and his ſorrows, but as he was a King, as he was the ſeat of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:94606:50"/>
Majeſty, as he was Royall, ſo alſo <hi>Pilate</hi> ſought his deliverance, and therefore in the verſe immediately before the Text, he ſaith unto the Jewes, <hi>Behold your King,</hi> ver. 14. Of the ſame perſon of whom he ſaid, <hi>Behold the Man,</hi> he now changing his ſtyle ſaith, <hi>Behold your King:</hi> as if he thus ſaid, if his ſorrowes as a man move you not, behold him as a King: Behold a King deprived of all his comforts, ſpoiled of all his goods, ſold by his Brethren, apprehended by his Subjects, ſcourged as a Villain, derided as a fool: Behold a King, who hath no other uſe of Majeſty, but to aggravate his miſery. Behold a King, whoſe ſufferings are as tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent as his perſon. Behold a King, who hath ſuffered things bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer then death. Behold a King, yea, your King, how he hath ſuffered even every thing but death. And will not this ſatisfie and content you? No, even all this will not do: For as ſome timerous fools, who though an Eele be flead, fear it while it yet ſtirs; and as cowards think no ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty while life appeares, even ſo the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:94606:51"/>
Rebellious Jewes, as if their King might have outlived his wounds, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered his loſſes, and turned his Reed into a Scepter; when <hi>Pilate</hi> ſaid, <hi>Behold your King</hi>; as if King were the bittereſt of all Corraſives, they cry out more fierce then ever, <hi>Tolle, Tolle, away with him, away with him,</hi> Juſtice and Execution both, <hi>Crucifie him, Crucifie him:</hi> And ſo we are brought to my Text, which was the laſt attempt; for when <hi>Pilate</hi> ſaw that neither his innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, nor his ſorrowes, nor his Majeſty could prevail, he then urgeth even their own credit: As if he had thus ſaid, If neither his being without a fault, nor his being in ſo heavy a plight, nor yet his being a King; yet for your own reſpects, and for your own repute ſpare the Sentence; for what is done unto your King will fall upon your ſelves, it will be diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable to you, and the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when it ſhall be ſaid, your King was Crucifyed. And thus you have the coherence and the reaſon why <hi>Pilate</hi> ſaid unto them, <hi>ſhall I Crucifie your King?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:94606:51"/>Now for the methodicall and better handling of the words, we ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of theſe two points, 1. To put a King to death, is againſt the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment both of Jew and Gentile, <hi>Pilate</hi> and the chief Prieſts. 2. What Jew and Gentile do againſt Judgement and Conſcience, that they do moſt barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly, <hi>Crucifie a King</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. To put a King to death is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the judgement both of Jew and Gentile. Jew and Gentile, it was the old diviſion of the World; and thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> takes it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.9. where ſaith he, <hi>Tribulation and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh upon every Soul of man that doth evill, of the Jew firſt, and alſo of the Gentile</hi>; that is upon every ſoul, upon all men; ſo that indeed the judgement of Jew and Gentile, it is the judgement of the whole World. Now that the judgement of Jew and Gentile were againſt this damnable and moſt horrid act, the putting of a King to death, this is evident, ſhould we go no further then the preſent verſe; for <hi>Pilate</hi> the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative of the Gentiles, the chief Prieſts, and Heads and Rulers of the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:94606:52"/>
Jews, both theſe in this very Text declare againſt it. Firſt, beſides all that hath been already ſaid, theſe very words in my Text argue <hi>Pilates</hi> diſavowing of it, <hi>Shall I Crucifie your King?</hi> Shall I paſſe Sentence of Death upon a King? Shall I deal with your King as with a Rogue? Send him to the Gibbet? Shall I do this? not I, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. if you will deal ſo with him, do it your ſelves, and therefore <hi>Pilate</hi> ſaith unto them, <hi>take ye him and Crucifie him</hi>; his Judgement and his Conſcience ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred the cruelty. And indeed no wonder, for if, as a Roman Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian,<note place="margin">Quintus Curtius.</note> 
                  <hi>Regium nomen gentes, quae ſub Regibus ſunt, pro Deo colunt:</hi> If the Gentiles, who lived under Kings, eſteemed the very name of a King as a deity, no wonder to hear a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Preſident ſtartle at the Sentence of a King. No wonder to hear <hi>Pilate</hi> ſay, <hi>Shall I Crucifie your King?</hi> For they who thus had the very name, they muſt needs have the perſon in veneration. Now as the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, ſo the very Jews in Judgement abhorred the very fact, abhorred the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:94606:52"/>
putting of their King to death. For when <hi>Pilate</hi> ſaid, <hi>Shall I Crucifie your King</hi>? Mark what immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, <hi>the chief Prieſts anſwered, We have no King but Caeſar</hi>: we have no ſuch King, he is no King of ours; were he our King, we would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire his ruine; were he our King, we would not have apprehended and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned him; were he our King, we would not thus proſecute him: <hi>The chief Prieſts anſwered, We have no King but Caeſar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Jews then it is evident, not in his regall, but in his perſonall ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, did perſecute our Saviour, not as King, but as Jeſus of <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth</hi> they brought him to his block. For in the 19. <hi>ver.</hi> when <hi>Pilate</hi> had made this inſcription, <hi>J. N. R. J. Jeſus of Nazareth King of the Jewes,</hi> the chief Prieſts became ſuitors to him to change the title, and to write, he ſaid <hi>I am King of the Jews,</hi> ver. 21. they would not by any means he ſhould be crucifyed under the notion and title of a King. Indeed as of one aſpiring to it they would have had it, but that they ſhould be ſuch curſed
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:94606:53"/>
wretches, as to bring a reall King unto a Croſſe; this even the Jewes abhorred, write him not King, but that he ſaid I am King. And indeed no wonder, for if we ſearch the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and obſerve but how highly, and to what end the Spirit of God uſeth the Name of a King, we ſhall finde the Jewes had very good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to reverence a King. For to ſhew that the perſon and ſtile of a King implies a full confluence of excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, when the Spirit of God makes an extraordinary alluſion, you ſhall finde he uſually borroweth from a King. <hi>Judg.</hi> 8.18. <hi>When Gideon asked Zeba and Zalmunna, What manner of men they were whom they ſlew at Tabor?</hi> They anſwered in the 18. verſ. <hi>as thou art, ſo are they, each one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled the Children of a King.</hi> The high expreſſion for ornament or beauty it is borrowed from a King, as the children of a King. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.14. <hi>The Kings Daughter is all glorious with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in</hi>: yea, and without too, for in the 15. <hi>v. She ſhall be brought unto the King in rayment of Needle-worke.</hi> When the Spirit of God ſpeaks of Grace,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:94606:53"/>
and glory, both alluſions relate unto the King; yea, ſo are the ſtiles of God and King interwoven in holy writ, that God is pleaſed not only to be called by theirs, but to allow them to be called by his Name. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.18. <hi>The Lord is King for ever and ever, the Lord our God he is a King:</hi> And as God is a King, even ſo the Jewes knew it was no blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to call a King a God; for I have ſaid, <hi>ye are Gods,</hi> ſaith the Lord: yea the moſt odious and higheſt accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that could be forged againſt poor <hi>Naboth,</hi> was in 1 <hi>King.</hi> 31.10. <hi>Thou didſt blaſpheme God and the King.</hi> Whereas then the Jewes were in the Book of God thus inſtructed of the Majeſty, and excellency of a King, <hi>Exod.</hi> 2.28. <hi>Their Law for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding them to revile their God, or ſo much as in thought to curſe the King, Eccleſ.</hi> 10.20. 'tis no wonder to hear them diſclaime their Soveraign, and to deny him their King, whoſe life they hunted after; <hi>Shall I Crucifie your King, ſaith Pilate? The chiefe Prieſts anſwered, We have no King but Caeſar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:94606:54"/>Though they deſtroyed and made away him who was indeed their King, yet they would not ſubſcribe, they would not as King own either the butchering or betraying of him, ſo that you ſee both <hi>Pilate</hi> and the chief Prieſts, both Jew and Gentile, they would both waſh their hands from this foul offence, they would not, did not put a King to death. The Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment both of Jew and Gentile was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it.</p>
               <p>The Application of this point ſhall teach us, to take heed that we do not betray our Conſciences, that we do not either for fear, or favour, for co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſſe or malice go againſt our own Conſciences, do againſt our own Judgement. Moſt true it is that of the Poet, <hi>Nemo repente fit turpiſſimus,</hi> No man at the firſt mounts to the height of wickedneſſe; but he who declines his Judgement, and he who can ſtretch or ſhrinke his Conſcience, as advantage admoniſheth, ſuch a one is preparing to all manner of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ormities.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pilate</hi> and the chief Prieſts in my Text, they are fearfull examples of
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:94606:54"/>
this truth, for when Fear ſate upon the Bench, and Malice ſtood Solicitor at the Barre; the poor King with all his Innocence, and for all his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, was ſure to miſcarry in the tryall: <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.24. <hi>When Pilate ſaw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water and waſhed his hands, ſaying, I am innocent of the bloud of this juſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>: See here in <hi>Pilate,</hi> how Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Judgement, how Fear and Conſcience ſtruggle: his Judgement that tels him the perſon was juſt, the bloud innocent, the King faultleſſe, and therefore as if the waſhing of his hands would have cleered his Conſcience, he calls for water and doth that; but him, whom his Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Conſcience pronounced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, him whom as a juſt perſon and a King, he would have delivered, even him, when fear ſuggeſted the fury of a multitude, when fear ſuggeſted a complaint to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> when fear ſtartled him with the hazard of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, then I ſay, even him whom Judgement acquitted, Fear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes; him, whom Conſcience pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:94606:55"/>
juſt, Fear delivers up him, who as a King, he was loath to Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie, even him, though a King, and a juſt one too, he will rather ſend to a Croſſe, then venture a Croſſe himſelfe. So that indeed not only the King in my Text, but even <hi>Pilate,</hi> the Lord Preſident himſelf, he had in ſtead of a Scepter, but a Reed, a Reed ſhaken with the winde, a Reed not able to ſtand in judgement, a Scepter that muſt bend as fear would have it.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Caiaphas</hi> ſate in Councell on the King in my Text, you ſhall finde he did not conſider what was juſt, but what was ſafe; <hi>John</hi> 11.49. <hi>Ye know nothing at all:</hi> as if he had ſaid, if ye move upon Principles of Right, Law, and juſtice, ye can do nothing, by them ye cannot take him away; but if ye conſider the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences of State, the ſafety of our ſelves, the ſecurity of the people, then expedient it is that one ſhould die, <hi>ver.</hi> 50. And indeed which of us is there that hath not a <hi>Caiaphas</hi> in his boſome? Which of us is there that doth not rather conſider the expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency then the juſtice of an Action?
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:94606:55"/>
which of us do not conſider whether what we do be not rather ſecure, then conſcionable? much more poiſing an outward broile, then an inward peace; and is not this the way to become as ſo many <hi>Pilates</hi>? Men who will ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice both Judgement, Loyalty, Conſcience and all honeſty to avoid an inconvenience. When <hi>Pilate</hi> gave eare unto his feares, he feares not with the ſame lips to ſentence, whom but now he pronounced without a fault.</p>
               <p>Now the good God grant that there be not a curſe impending over this Land, even for ſuch Judges; for ſuch who have rather ſteered by their Feares, then by their Conſciences; for ſuch who have rather for expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diency then Juſtice, condemned the Innocent.</p>
               <p>Again, as <hi>Pilates</hi> feare, even ſo the Pride, the Ambition and Malice of the chief Prieſt, theſe alſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted judgement, and theſe made the Conſcience paſſe what they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.18. <hi>Pilate knew that for envy they had delivered him,</hi> the perſecution of the King was a meer
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:94606:56"/>
piece of envy; they had nothing to lay to his charge, nothing could they prove, nay, nothing did they pretend but ſome State and forged ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: <hi>John</hi> 11.48. <hi>If we let him alone all men will believe on him, and the Romans ſhall come and take away both our King and Nation.</hi> Becauſe they were jealous of the Romans, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt he be taken away, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as indeed the Romans were reſerved to be the avengers of his bloud. <hi>The Romans came not till that time was come, in which his bloud was required of them and their children,</hi> verſ. 12. Sometimes his charge is, he made himſelf a King, whereas indeed he was no admitted, no elected, but a native King, <hi>born King of the Jews, Mat.</hi> 2.2. yea in <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. <hi>He ought to die, becauſe he made himſelf the Son of God</hi>; ſee the peeviſhneſſe of envy, they accuſe him for being what he could not but be from all eternity, the begotten of the Father, and no ſooner born, then born a King; and yet becauſe the Son of God, and becauſe a King, he muſt die the death; yea, yet tis worth the time to
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:94606:56"/>
ſee, how when Envy and Malice per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutes, ſo the perſon fals, they care not by what means; care not to ruine themſelves, ſo they ſee but his fall: The chief Prieſts in my Text, thoſe who pretended their King muſt therefore die, becauſe if not, <hi>Venient Romani,</hi> the Romans will come in, even theſe, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then he ſhall not die, will lay down even their own necks to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſervitude; for as if they were the faſt friends, and greateſt honourers of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> who but they cry out, <hi>We have no King but Caeſar?</hi> Crucifie Chriſt, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy Jeſus, for behold we are for the Roman party, <hi>no King but Caeſar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They who know any thing of the Jewiſh ſtory, cannot but know <hi>Caeſar,</hi> the Roman foraine power, thoſe were to the Jews the moſt hatefull things under Heaven: and yet to glut their ſpleen, and to ſatisfie their envy, behold <hi>Caeſar</hi> preferred to Chriſt, and a foraine juriſdiction before their own King: to ſuch a madneſſe are men brought, when lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving judgement and conſcience, they follow the wilde byas of corrupt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Indeed ſometimes, as the Father towards the Children, even ſo <hi>pater patriae,</hi> the Father of his Countrey, the King and Ruler of his people, he is touched with, is tender and ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the grievances and preſſures of his people; and for this very end it was, the King in my Text was born,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:94606:60"/>
for this very end it was he dyed, he was both the Saviour and Martyr of his people.</p>
               <p>But ſo rare is a reciprocall Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy from the people to the King, that it is not improbable, therefore the King is above their Judgement, becauſe amongſt his Subjects he can have no Peers, none of his own rank, no equals, and therefore no impartiall Judges of his ſufferings.</p>
               <p>And of this there can be no greater Preſident, then the perſon in my Text; for as there was never any ſorrow like his ſorrow, even ſo never leſſe regard then he had; for behold a King upon the Croſſe, and his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects reviling, mocking, and deriding of him: ſo that indeed before we can be truly and throughly ſenſible of this paſſion, of the paſſion of a King, we muſt put on higher then ordinary affections, we muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted, and through the grace of his bloud, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.6. we muſt be made Kings our ſelves, that is, men of more high and royall conceptions; we muſt take it into a very ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, how great a perſon, how
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:94606:60"/>
Noble, how Royall he was that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for us.</p>
               <p>I know there are ſome in the world, who are ready to ſay, what is a King but a man? As if there were nothing more in a King, then in an ordinary capacity: whereas to any man minding the book of God, it is evident, the King is far above his People, as the Hill above the Vale, or the Bramble below the Cedar: <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. When God renewed his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and promiſed a bleſſing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> he tels him, that he will not only make him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding fruitfull, but he would add this bleſſing alſo, <hi>Kings ſhall come out of thee, verſ.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>Now if to be the Father of Kings were no more, then to be the Father of ordinary men, God in ſaying, <hi>Kings ſhall come out of thee,</hi> had ſaid juſt nothing; and yet God, you ſee, as a ſpeciall and ſingular favour, after the promiſe of a numerous iſſue, even of whole Nations, adds, as more then all that, <hi>Kings ſhall come out of thee</hi>; ſo that Kings in Gods eſteem are more then ordinary men, more
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:94606:61"/>
then whole Nations. As God, ſo the man after Gods own heart, he thought, and knew ſo highly of a King, that he taxes it as one of the greateſt favours upon Earth, to be allied to a King: 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.23. <hi>Is it a light thing to be Sonne in Law to a King?</hi> Yea, that curſed wretch <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſabell,</hi> who though ſhe was full of bloud and iniquity, yet ſaith <hi>Jeh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>So that indeed, if we ſhould weigh Kings in the ballance of the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, it will be found that Kings will weigh much more than ordinary men: Whereas then it is ſaid in my Text, <hi>Shall I Crucifie your King?</hi> We ſhall betray the paſſion, if we take not ſerious cognizance of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
               <p>When Divines meditate, and ſpeak of the Incarnation, we thinke it no mean portion, of that great bleſſing that God hath pleaſed to ſend, not ſome new Creature, not an Angell, not a <hi>Seraphim,</hi> but his Sonne, that the Sonne became fleſh, that God
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:94606:61"/>
bleſſed for ever, would become a Babe, this it even aſtoniſhed appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion.</p>
               <p>Now as it is not poſſible we ſhould conceive as we ought, of the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, unleſſe we conſider who was Incarnate, and who it was took fleſh upon him: even ſo of the Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Agony, and bitterneſſe of his ſufferings, we can never take any tolerable eſtimate, or any valuable proportion, unleſſe conſideration be firſt had of the nobleneſſe, and who was the perſon that did ſuffer: God (<hi>qui omnia diſponit ſuaviter</hi>) who ſweetly diſpoſes all things, though he had been pleaſed his Son ſhould be borne, yet had not his wiſdome had uſe of this relation, he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have had him been born a King; or had he been born a King, he would never have taken ſuch order for the proclamation of it; he would never have brought wiſe men to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> to proclaime him King, neither would he ever have ſo guided the pen of <hi>Pilate,</hi> as to write upon the Croſſe, <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth King of the Jewes</hi>; but that his will was
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:94606:62"/>
and is, we ſhould look upon him a King, as well as a Saviour.</p>
               <p>Amongſt us men (even the moſt envious of us) we look upon the fault and failings of Kings, as the moſt eminent wickedneſſe. A wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed King, a Tyrant, a Murtherer, we thinke the moſt execrable of all ſinners; as ſome thought of thoſe, <hi>on whom the Tower of Siloe fell, Luk.</hi> 13.4. even ſo men generally hold of wicked Princes, even that they are ſinners above them, that dwell about them.</p>
               <p>To apply this then to our preſent purpoſe, if it be ſo that the eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Princes, and the excellency of Kings ſo dignifie and exalt their perſons, that the ſame crimes in them are much more abominable, then in meaner perſons; certainly then as their crimes, even ſo their ſufferings muſt be proportionably aggravated by their perſons the ſufferings of a King muſt needs be as far beyond the ſufferings of a Subject, as are the ſins of a Prince beyond the ſins of a Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant.</p>
               <p>Whereas then the perſon in my
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:94606:62"/>
Text is a ſuffering King, we muſt not look upon his Sufferings as the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of an ordinary perſon, for look by how much his perſon, by ſo much doth his Paſſion exceed the Sons of men; for if it be (as doubtleſſe it is) a great amplification of Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that he who ſuffered was a Son, it muſt yet be more that this Son was a King: for as an extraordinary fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God to his people <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as the Pſalmiſt ſayes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 136.17, 18. <hi>He ſmote great Kings, and flew mighty Kings for their ſakes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When Kings ſuffer, Heaven hath a great hand in it, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. <hi>The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, the Children of Iſrael, would not let David their King go out to battaile with them,</hi> becauſe ſay they in the 3. <hi>ver. Thou art worth ten thouſands of us</hi>: The Sufferings of the King muſt have at leaſt this valuation, for as God knowes how many thouſands ſuffer in a King, even ſo we may as ſoon count the Stars, as ſay for how many millions of men this King did ſuffer.</p>
               <p>A reaſon then why this Sonne of God, bleſſed for ever, was not only
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:94606:63"/>
born of a Virgin, but born a King, and dyed a King; A reaſon of this may very well be, becauſe he was to ſuffer the bittereſt of all torments, becauſe he was to ſuffer ſorrow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Parallel, becauſe he was to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſuch ſorrow, like to which there was no ſorrow; and this as man he could not have done, had he not been put into the moſt high and moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable condition. For whether we look upon the tenderneſſe of his conſtitution, the exquiſiteneſſe of his torture, the anguiſh and duration of the whole; all this had it been in the relation of a Subject, all this had it been in him, as a perſon of low condition, could not have amounted to what he did; for neither tenderneſſe nor torture, neither pain nor ſhame, neither ſmart nor ſorrow, is ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable and ſo valuable in any, as a Royall Subject.</p>
               <p>Whereas then, the Sufferer in my Text, is not only a God, but a King alſo; not only a Saviour but a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, in what capacity ſoever we look upon him, whether it be as God, or wether it be as Man: He was the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:94606:63"/>
only Supreme, and Soveraign ſufferer in the world.</p>
               <p>Paſſe we then from the nobleneſſe of the Sufferer, to take a glimpſe of the ignobleneſs of his Paſſion, imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this word Crucifie, <hi>they Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifyed their King, ver.</hi> 11. It was ſaid of old, <hi>Multorum manibus grande levatur opus,</hi> many hands make light worke; but if we would piercingly and exactly look upon this Paſſion, upon this murthering of a King, we ſhall finde many hands indeed, but for work the heavieſt that ever was read of; and how could it well be other, when the miſeries of this poor King was to ſatisfie the malice of two parties? <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.1. <hi>When the morning was come, all the chief Prieſts,</hi> and as the Greek hath it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>the lay-Presbyters, or the Elders of the people, took counſell against Jeſus to put him to death</hi>; they who prepared, plotted, and purpoſed their Kings deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they who raiſed an Army, and ſent Swords and ſtaves to apprehend him, theſe were (you ſee) an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of Prieſts and Elders, yet theſe were not they that did the deed, theſe
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:94606:64"/>
were not the Executioners, theſe Voted, but theſe did not Crucifie: Now in <hi>verſe</hi> 27. of the ſame Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, you ſhall find <hi>the Souldiers of the Governours took Jeſus into the common Hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of Souldiers, and they ſtripped him, they fooled him,</hi> verſe 28. <hi>they crowned, they mockt him, they ſpit upon him,</hi> verſe 29. and when they had ſported enough at his ſorrowes, then in the 35. <hi>verſe</hi> of the Chapter, <hi>They Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified him</hi>; they (not the Presbyters or Elders) but the Souldiers brought him to the block, they Crucified him. Not barely and ſimply put him to death, but they put him <hi>ad mortem erucis,</hi> to the death of the Croſſe; and indeed this had not been Envies Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-piece, had it not been ſo, had they not cloathed him with ſhame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as well as macerated him with pain; had they not put him as well to an ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as an irkſome death, Envy would have ſeemed too dull, and too cool a perſecutor.</p>
               <p>And therefore to expreſſe the zeal and activity of their cruelty, it is not ſaid here, they ſlew, but they Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:94606:64"/>
him, that is, they inflicted on him the extremity of ſhame, ſorrow, death. To a perſon of Honour, and eſpecially to the fountain of Honour, to a King, ſhame and diſhonour, it is bitterer then death: ſo that indeed it is hard to ſay, whether the diſpoſition to, and manner of his death, was not more affliction to the King, then death it ſelf: for if we look upon theſe three particulars (though we muſt paſſe over a thouſand bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes:)</p>
               <p n="1">1. What was done before they brought him to the Court of Juſtice?</p>
               <p n="2">2. What was done there?</p>
               <p n="3">3. What after Sentence? we ſhall finde there was nothing done, but what ſpeaks Tyranny and Malice.</p>
               <p>For firſt, to take off the appearance of their Envy, and to make Malice ſeem zeal unto the publick: behold the King muſt be brought as a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner to the Barre, and as a Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor before the Court of Juſtice: but if we obſerve the Tryall, we ſhall finde nothing but envy and Malice in it.</p>
               <p>For in a place I now cited, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.7.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:94606:65"/>I ſhewed unto you how the <hi>Priests and Elders took counſell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Jeſus to put him to death,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ever they brought him to the Court of Juſtice, before ever any Proceſſe drawn, or witneſſes found out, the Prieſts and Elders had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved upon the queſtion, they ſate in Councell, and had agreed, the King muſt die, the Preſident muſt and ſhould give the Sentence of death upon him: So that indeed the bringing him before a Judge, the bringing the King before <hi>Annas, Caiaphas, Herod</hi> and <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,</hi> this his appearance at four ſeverall Courts, it was only to put a faire Face upon an ugly Sentence, it only was, by the mockery of juſtice to cloak the cruelty of malice; for before ever he came thither, the Councell had determined, Jeſus their King muſt die.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſee the carriage of the buſineſſe when it came there, and we ſhall finde that he was not tryed by any courſe of Law, or by any legall principles: for if we look upon him as before <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> before the chief Prieſts and the Elders, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.59.
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:94606:65"/>
we ſhall find that all his Judges were parties, for the Scripture expreſly ſaith, <hi>the chief Priests and Elders, and all the Councell ſought falſe witneſſe againſt Jeſus,</hi> all the Councell, all that ſate his Judges, or that did riſe up in Judgment againſt him, they conſpired and plotted how to put their King to death; or look we upon him as he ſtood before <hi>Pilate,</hi> before the Preſident, and we ſhall finde it was the Multitude, it was the Tumult, it was Voices, not Law, that carryed the cauſe againſt him. <hi>When Pilate ſaw that he could not prevail any thing, but that rather a Tumult was made, Mat.</hi> 27.24. then he releaſed <hi>Barab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas,</hi> and delivered Jeſus to be Crucified; Tumult and Votes, not Law or Juſtice, brought the King unto his Croſſe.</p>
               <p>Indeed in the 25. <hi>ver.</hi> of the ſaid 27. Chapter of St. <hi>Matthew</hi> it is written, <hi>Then anſwered all the people, his bloud be on us, and our children</hi>; the chiefe Prieſts and Elders, the prime and cloſe managers of this deſigne, they inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and intitle the people to it, as if this had been an Act of the whole

               <p>And this wil appear from theſe two things,
<list>
                     <item>1. The place.</item>
                     <item>2. The Inſtrument of his death.</item>

               </p>
               <p>Firſt, the place, <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Royall City, the City of <hi>David</hi>; and muſt it not needs be an aggravation of ſhame, and ſorrow for the Sonne of <hi>David,</hi> for the King of <hi>Sion,</hi> there to lay his head upon the block, there to wear a Crowne of
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:94606:67"/>
Thornes, and there judicially to be put to death, where he, and he only ſhould have ſate upon the Throne? Indeed it was not done before his Palace, it was not done before his own doors, but it was done <hi>in Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentali parte,</hi> it was done in the Weſt part of the City, it was there done where it might bring moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt and diſtaſte upon him. <hi>Mans Calvariae, id est decollatorum,</hi> Mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> that is, according to <hi>Jerome,</hi> the place of common Execution, the place where Malefactors were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed; now there where that ſame day a couple of theeves were to be put to death, there, and in the midſt of them (as if he had been like to one of them) as a Tyrant, a Traytor, a Murtherer, and a publick enemy, they Crucifyed their King, and they put to death even the Lord of glory: So that indeed, not only the place, but the very inſtrument of his death, that he ſhould be nayl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Croſſe, be numbred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong tranſgreſſors, and dye a Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, this is to a King, to a righteous innocent King, a thing bitterer then death.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:94606:67"/>Secondly, And in a word then to conclude this point, when the Jews were ſo Rebellious as to conſpire and attempt the Killing of their King, they added this wickedneſſe above all, they killed him after the moſt ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous way, after the moſt irkſome and tedious invention, that thoſe times had.</p>
               <p>They were not ſo mercifull as to lay an Axe unto his throat, or a Sword unto his Heart, but in the places moſt remote, in the Hands and Feet, where they might multiply anguiſh, and not haſten death; where they might wound, but not kill; where they might afflict, but not diſpatch; there they tormented, there they tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured, there they ſtudyed to grieve and vex his righteous Soul: So that of all the ſad ſpectacles under Heaven, of all the cruelties that ever the Beaſts of the people preſented to the world, there is none like to oppreſſed Majeſty: never is Ambition, Envy, Malice, or what brutiſh affection ſoever ſo predominant, never is Rage and Fury ſo highly, and ſo full fed as when it drinks the bloud Royall;

               <p>Firſt, it ſhould teach us to be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, looking in all our croſſes and troubles on a Crucified King. Well known is that Motto, <hi>Bona agere, &amp; mala pati Regium eſt,</hi> To do good,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:94606:68"/>
and ſuffer evill, it is a Royall, and Kingly part; and indeed never did any King ſo act this part, as the King in my Text; for if we look upon his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions, and acts of grace, we ſhall find that they were beyond all that were ever granted.</p>
               <p>And on the otherſide, if we look upon the injuries and indignities he ſuffered, if we look upon the provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and vexations, the Inſolence and Malice, Jealouſies and Feares did heap upon him, we ſhall finde him a Patient beyond Preſident, ſo that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is hard to ſay, whether this King did more good, or ſuffered more evill for us; ſuch good he did, that except the integrety of his ſoul, he Sacrificed all the reſt.</p>
               <p>Such evill he endured, he loſt but all which man could deprive him of; ſuch good he did, that preſerving what might make him a Saviour, he gave up even all, as he was a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign; ſuch evill he indured, that thoſe very wretches, for whom he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, triumphed in his miſeries, and (though his Subjects) gloried to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult upon him. So that indeed there
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:94606:69"/>
cannot be an exacter piece of patience then this harrowed and Crucified King: 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Christ ſuffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye ſhould follow his ſteps.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our King not only ſuffered for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, but alſo for imitation; ſo that indeed we are not only to look upon him as a Saviour, but alſo as a ſufferer; not only who ſuffered for us, but alſo as one who made himſelfe an example to teach us to ſuffer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and indeed in what can we ſuffer, in which we have not him for an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? Honour, Freedome, Eſtate, Friends, Life, theſe are the darlings that we dote upon; and in which of theſe can we ſo deeply ſuffer in, as our King did? In Honour we cannot, for his is the Throne, and ours but the Footſtoole; he the Fountaine, and we but the waſt of his fulneſſe. And yet in point of Honour never was ſuch a ſufferer as he was, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they could never have made him ſuch a ſufferer, had they not firſt wounded, and deveſted him of his Honour: we ſhall ſee in <hi>Num.</hi> 16. that grand and firſt conſpiracy of

               <p>Again, as Diſhonour, even ſo Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, it is a preſſing grievance, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when the eſtate that ſhould ſweeten, and the Friends that ſhould comfort, are taken alſo; and yet if it pleaſe God to put us to it, it is no more then his own Son, no more then his own Anointed, no more then the King endured.

               </p>
               <p>And have not we here a leſſon well worth the learning? Shall God and the King be charitable, and ſhall not we? Shall they forgive, and we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute?

               <p>Had not the King in my Text been a King, whoſe wrath was much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his pity, of all men we had been moſt miſerable.

forgive heartily our very enemies.</p>
               <p>Our late Kings charity perſwaded him, that it was not his perſon but his errors, which his Subjects Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led againſt; it was not their malice, but their ſcruples that put them upon it; juſt like the King in my Text, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to weakneſſe then wilfulneſſe, rather to infirmity then to obſtinacy, rather to ignorance then envy, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes the high miſcarriages againſt him, <hi>Father forgive them, for they know not what they do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall conclude this point with that Heroick,<note place="margin">Plu.

                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:94606:75"/>Now if Magnanimity in a Heathen did this, what ſhould charity in a Chriſtian, eſpecially being animated with ſuch Royall Preſidents as we are? Though our bleſſed King in my Text, ſuffered ſuch indignities, even the fouleſt that malice could impoſe on Majeſty, though they ſpit upon him, Whipt him, and upon his very Croſſe derided him, yet in the bitterneſſe of that pain, behold his charity, <hi>Father forgive them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo I paſſe to the laſt uſe of this point, and that is, that it ſhould make us penitent; for it will appear, that it was not his, but our ſins; not his, but our Enormous crimes that Crucified the King: 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.25. the Prophet tels the people thus, <hi>If ye ſhall do wickedly, ye ſhall be conſumed, both you and your King</hi>; not only ye, but your King, ſo that you ſee the wickedneſſe of a people may be the cauſe of a Kings deſtruction: If you do wickedly, not only you, but your King alſo ſhall come to ruine, ye and your King ſhall periſh.</p>

               <p>It was our Pride that brought him into deriſion, our Covetouſneſſe made him poor, our Pomp that ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped him, our Wrath that wounded him; It was our Drunkenneſſe that made him thirſt, our Luſt that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured his thornes, our Riot that drew his bloud: ſo that indeed it concerns not only the Jews, but even us alſo to be penitent; it concernes not only his immediate perſecutors, but even us alſo to be humbled, and be caſt downe for the death of our King;

bloud, it is to be truly penitent, to be heartily ſorrowfull, to be grieved and pricked at the very heart, that we have done that, for the which Royall and Divine Majeſty did ſo deeply ſuffer. Nor only muſt we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, ſaith St. <hi>Peter,</hi> but convert alſo; that is, we muſt ſet the King upon his throne, we muſt, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> renders it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. <hi>Pull down all ſtrong holds, caſt down every ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, and bring every thought to the obedience of our King.</hi> For he who was deſpiſed, rejected of men, even he was the beloved, the Anointed of the Lord; he who was inſolently<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> triumphed over, and trampled upon by his Subjects, yet even he was more then Conquerour; yea he, who was cut off from the Land of the living, even he yet liveth, and liveth the King of glory.</p>
               <p>So that indeed, unleſſe we be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, unleſſe we ſuffer him to raign over us, unleſſe we kiſſe, reverence, and obey the Son, we periſh from the right way, we cannot avoid the guilt of his bloud.</p>

If he through Thorns and ſhame, through anguiſh, ſorrow, and ſhamefull death; if he through bloud, even his own bloud, was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to march unto his throne; how can we hope to ſit on thrones, unleſs we will trample on thornes? No Croſſe, no Crown. It is enough for the Servant to be as his Lord, enough for Chriſtians (ſince their King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was not) even after death to be glorious.</p>
               <p>And indeed, did we as he ſo look upon the joy that is ſet before us, as to ſpurne at the ſplendid vanities of this World, had we an Eye piercing into the Heavens, we would then, as did he, indure the Croſſe, and deſpiſe the ſhame; we would not then to go to God much fear or care what man can do unto us. Let us then in all our ſorrowes, all our ſufferings, in all the changes and chances of theſe ſad Times, remember we are
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:94606:79"/>
the profeſſed Servants of a Crucified King; of a King, who as to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maturity, injuſtice, ſhame, ſcorn and cruelty of his death, ſuffered more then we can fear, and all this to take away the ſting of our ſufferings, to teach us looking upon him not to fear to ſuffer; to teach us that his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings are the ſanctification of ours; to teach us not to value our bloud in his cauſe, who was pleaſed to ſhed his upon the Croſſe for us. To that King then, who bore our ſhame, let us aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe al honour; to that King that bare our ſorrowes, let us give all praiſe; to that King who gave his life for us, let us give up our lives; ſo ſhall we, who believe him Crucified, behold him glorified, and out of his fulneſſe receive ſuch a glory, as ſhall never be taken from us. Which he vouchſafe, who was Crucifyed for us, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous. To whom be all honour, and glory, now and for ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>

Councell of State, what by his Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations publiſhed by his Prophets, Treaties with him, and Anſwers from him, they were ſo far convinced, that even at their very Councell-Table, they were forced to ſay—<hi>If we let him alone, all men will believe on him</hi>;<note place="margin">Joh. 11.47.</note> yea ſo great and clear was the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of his worth, and wiſdom, that ſo far were the people undecei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that even they cryed out,<note place="margin">Mar. 7.37.</note> 
                  <hi>Bene omnia fecit</hi>; he hath done all things well. So that though ignorance in ſome might abate more then in ſome others, yet ſo clearly were moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced this was the Heir, that the guilt of wilful Murther it came heavily even upon the whole Nation.</p>
               <p>It would then by us be ſeriouſly and timeouſly conſidered, whether thoſe ſins will be allowed as ſins of Ignorance, which we act againſt Knowledge? or thoſe ſins of Infirmity which we act meerly to ſave a peny, or to ſatsfie a Luſt?</p>

               <p>This is the Heir, and this Heir he was <hi>Chriſtus Domini,</hi> the Lords Anointed, for this is that Heir of whom it is written, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.2. <hi>In theſe laſt dayes he hath ſpoken by his Sonne, whom he hath appointed Heir of all things.</hi> This is that Sonne and Heir, who is ſaid to be <hi>the Lord, the Chriſt, the Anointed of God</hi>;<note place="margin">Act. 4.26, 27.</note> And indeed his being thus, his being Gods Anointed, his being ſuch an Heir as had no <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour</hi> but his Father, no equall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth; His being ſuch an Heir, as was next and <hi>immediate</hi> under God, ſuch an Heir as was not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Landlord, but the King of the Vineyard, The <hi>Covenanting</hi> and Combining and making an head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch an Heir: This, this is the <hi>Treaſon,</hi> the Villany, and the abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Text.

But if we conſider his Inaugu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and the <hi>Additionalls</hi> to his Birth right, we ſhall then finde him an Heire of great Conſequence; For though where his Birth-right is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, he is onely ſtiled <hi>King of the Jewes,</hi> yet if we looke upon his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtiture, and Gods Deſignation, we ſhall finde it was not onely the <hi>Land</hi> of <hi>Judea,</hi> but even the whole World was his inheritance.

               <p>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:94606:93"/>The point then put to the queſtion, and that which they were to reaſon of, we may finde by the connexion of the precedent to this preſent verſe; for, ſaith the Father there,<note place="margin">Verſ. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>I will ſend my beloved Sonne</hi>: and then followeth to what end, and that is to ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they <hi>will reverence</hi> him, or no? Now upon this they meet, upon this they conſult, and in the negative they conclude, and vote they will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence. So that their debate and reaſonings, was probably upon theſe two heads:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Upon what they had done.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Upon what they were reſolv'd to doe: And both theſe we have within the confines of our parable.</p>
               <p>Firſt, an Epitome of what they had done, we have in the 10.11. and 12. verſes; and that briefly is, A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of their Lord, in the abuſe of his Meſſengers.<note place="margin">Mat. 21.35.</note> And indeed the firſt ſtep to pull down the Maſter it is to trample upon the Miniſter; They <hi>beat,</hi> they put to <hi>ſhame,</hi> yea they put to <hi>Death</hi> ſuch as were ſent unto them. Not onely did they deny their Duties, to pay their Tribute, and to ſend

fruit; but as if thoſe whom the Father ſent, had been ſo many <hi>Evill Counſellors,</hi> they take, and hang them up as Male-factors. Yea, and that they <hi>then</hi> doe, when indeed all their meſſages were <hi>meſſages of peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now having been not only <hi>rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> in denying their Obedience, but alſo <hi>ungratefull,</hi> even unto bloud, in the ſlaughter of the Prophets<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Husbandmen might very well fall a <hi>Reaſoning</hi> what was now to be done, whether Reverence, or Reſiſtance, whether a <hi>Submiſſion</hi> to the Heire; with an Act of pardon and Oblivion?

Yea, as if the <hi>Heire</hi> had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated, and put them upon all theſe villanies, they Reſolve further, they will be <hi>Avenged</hi> upon the Heire, and that is the ſecond point they Reaſon,

and conſult about—<hi>They Reaſoned among themſelves, ſaying, this is the Heire, come</hi>—let us take ſome order with him, let us ſo deale with him, that the Inheritance may be ours; ſo deale with him, that he may be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to <hi>us,</hi> not we to <hi>him</hi>; In a word, they Reaſoned, ſaying—<hi>This is the Heire, come let us kill him.</hi> So that the ſecond and maine part of their Reaſoning was how to diſpoſe, and order what was requiſite to this end; And indeed this required a great deale of Reaſoning too. For, if we looke but upon <hi>verſ.</hi> 5, 6. of this <hi>Chapter,</hi> we ſhall find they ſtood in ſuch <hi>Awe</hi> of the people, that they durſt not paſſe a raſh judgement, no not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Baptiſme of <hi>John,</hi> much leſſe upon the <hi>Heire</hi> in the Text. And therefore they firſt reaſon among themſelves how to take off the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and how to make him deſpicable in their eſteeme. And indeed, to ſumme up that long work in a word, this they did by taking <hi>his Revenew</hi> and his Honour from him. For take from the <hi>Heire</hi> his Vineyard, take even from <hi>Majeſty</hi> it ſelfe what ſhould
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:94606:95"/>
ſupport it, <hi>Reverence</hi> and <hi>Revenew,</hi> and then the Heire will be lookt upon more like a Carpenters Son, than the Lord of a Vineyard; ſo that in deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to reverence the Sonne, they rais'd a Scaffold for the ruine of him: And that's the <hi>Conſequence</hi> of their Treaty, after they had reaſon'd among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they conclude,— <hi>Occidamus, Let us kill him.</hi>

                  <hi>Our Inheritance.</hi> They who endure not an Inheritance in the Heir, when themſelves have got it, then they could be well content to ſay, <hi>Our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance</hi>: But ſee how differently unjuſt men, and the juſt God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, for that which the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men call <hi>ours,</hi> and <hi>our</hi> Inheritance; that the juſt God makes to them as <hi>Jonahs</hi> Gourd,<note place="margin">Jon. 4.7.</note> a thing of no conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance. So that the Husbandmen, when they caſt out <hi>the Heir,</hi> they were as farre miſtaken, as if the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners in <hi>Jonahs</hi> ſtory, had in ſtead of the <hi>Prophet</hi> caſt out the <hi>Pylot.</hi> For whom they caſt out was not the <hi>cauſe,</hi> but muſt have been the <hi>calmer</hi> of the Tempeſt.

               <p>There is a ſtory of a certain Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi>

                  <hi>Jezabel</hi> drew up the Conveyances of poor <hi>Naboths</hi> Vineyard in his own bloud, but it was cancel'd quickly, and waſht out with hers. <hi>Athalia</hi> (like the Husbandmen in my Text) with the <hi>bloud of Heirs,</hi>

               <p>And indeed (would time permit) it were not hard to ſhew theſe Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen, who by the <hi>Red Sea</hi> of the Heirs bloud, thought to bring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

to <hi>Canaan,</hi> in ſtead of <hi>Canaan</hi> brought upon themſelves a <hi>Miſerable Deſolation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Prieſts and Presbytery,</hi> thoſe who firſt conſpired, and plotted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Heir, thoſe who reckoned <hi>upon large Vineyards,</hi> and golden In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritances; even theſe by their <hi>own ſtratagem,</hi> were fruſtate in their hopes, and deprived of their Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. For as they by pretence of Juſt and Holy men, ſought to undermine the <hi>Heir,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ver. 20.</note> and to engroſſe the richeſt <hi>Vineyards</hi>: Even ſo another Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, under pretence of more zeal, and under pretence of more purity, Thoſe whom <hi>Joſephus</hi> cals the <hi>zealous,</hi> they enter upon their poſſeſſions, and they caſt even <hi>them</hi> out of their <hi>Vineyards</hi>; yea both the one and the other, when the <hi>Romans</hi> came, were <hi>themſelves ſerv'd</hi> as they <hi>ſerv'd</hi> the Heir, they were kill'd, and were caſt out of their Inheritance; yea, it was made capitall for any of theſe Husbandmen, ſo much as to look towards their Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance. So that of whatever ſhall be got by bloud, Uſurpation and unjuſt wayes, of that God will not ſuffer us
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:94606:108"/>
to have an Inheritance, nor permit any of us long to ſay, This is ours.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Pſ. 37.18.</note>To conclude all, <hi>The Lord knoweth the dayes of the upright, and their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance ſhall be for ever.</hi> Whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver deſires to have a durable Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, whether it be here or hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; the way to it is <hi>Righteouſneſſe</hi> and <hi>

For (as you have heard) thoſe who ſo highly dared, as to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe <hi>his Vineyard,</hi> and to call what was <hi>the Heirs</hi> their own; in ſtead of being <hi>Heires,</hi> the Father hath made them <hi>Vagabonds</hi> to this day: ſo that what the Heir in his perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſaid of himſelfe, the ſame may to this day be ſaid of thoſe <hi>rebellious Husbandmen, The Foxes have Holes and the Birds of the ayre have Neſts</hi>
                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:94606:108"/>
but in that <hi>Zion,</hi> which they ſought to build with bloud, and in that <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> which they thought to eſtabliſh by iniquity; thoſe, their children who ſlew the Heir, they have not where to lay their heads. And ſo, Lord, let it be to all thoſe who have evill will to <hi>Zion,</hi> ſo to them who delight in bloud.</p>
               <p>Indeed, the <hi>Inheritance of the Saints,</hi> and that which all good men look af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it was purchaſed <hi>with bloud,</hi> and with the bloud of the Heir too: But, 'twas not purchaſed for ſuch who <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in bloud,</hi> for ſuch who <hi>glory in their ſhame,</hi> nor for ſuch who ſtill <hi>continue murthering of the Heir.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If ſo then, when this tranſitory In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance ſhall fail, we would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into <hi>everlaſting habitations:</hi> If we would be <hi>Joynt Heirs</hi> with the Heir in my Text, and ſhare with him in his incorruptible Inheritance: Know we muſt, <hi>Tranſit Haereditas cum onere,</hi> This Inheritance paſſeth to none, but carryeth peculiar burthens and conditions with it, ſuch as are— Penitence, Faith, Obedience, Charity, Meekneſſe, Humilitity, and whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is agreeable to found Doctrine:
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:94606:109"/>
So that in a word, I ſhall cloſe with that of St. <hi>Paul,</hi>

                  <hi>If we ſuffer with him, we ſhall alſo be glorifyed with him.</hi> The way to be joynt Heir with the Heir in my Text, is not (as the worldly wiſe) to comply with all <hi>Intereſts</hi>: but it is ſo to ſet our ſoules upon <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and <hi>heavenly Inheritance,</hi> that we eſteem no <hi>worldly heritage,</hi> nothing that we call ours, not our <hi>goods,</hi> not our <hi>bloud,</hi> in order and relation unto it. For indeed, if we reſpect the comfort and durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it; <hi>we can Inherit,</hi> that is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely poſſeſſe as ours, nothing at all till we come to that; All then remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is, that we betake our ſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our prayers, that ſo <hi>our guilt</hi> of that Bloud may be exchanged into the <hi>Merit</hi> of it, and that we for his ſake may be made Co-heirs of ſuch an Inheritance, as never ſhall be taken from us.
