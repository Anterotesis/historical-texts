            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Credulity and Superstition of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind hath given great Opportunities and Advantages to cunning <hi>Knaves</hi> to spread their Nets, and lay their Traps in order to catch easie and unwary Creatures; these being led on by Ignorance, or Stupidity, they by Pride or Ambition, or else a Vile and Mercenary Principle; Therefore seeing we are in this State of Corruption, bred up to believe Contradictions and Impossibilities, led by the Nose with every State <hi>Mountebank,</hi> and <hi>Monkish Iugler,</hi> moved like <hi>Puppets</hi> by Strings and Wires; it seems high time to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate Humane Nature, and to free her from these Shackles, laid upon her in the very Cradle; for <hi>Man</hi> (who ought to be a Free and Rational <hi>Animal</hi>) in his present State is only an <hi>Engine</hi> and <hi>Machine,</hi> contriv'd for the Vanity and Luxury of <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Tyrants,</hi> who claim to themselves, and seem to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolize the Divine <hi>Stamp,</hi> tho' we are all made of the same Materials, by the same Tools, and in the same Mould, equal by Nature, met together and link'd in Societies by mutual Contracts, plac'd by turns one above another, and entrusted for some time with the Power of executing our own Laws, and all by general consent for the Publick Good of the whole <hi>Community</hi>; this is the genuine Shape and Figure of Primitive and Sound Government, not distemper'd and fatally infected with the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struous <hi>Excrescencies</hi> of Arbitrary <hi>Power</hi> in one single <hi>Member</hi> above all the Laws of the <hi>whole; Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility,</hi> Divine <hi>Right,</hi> &amp;c. started by <hi>Knaves</hi> and <hi>Sycophants,</hi> believ'd by <hi>Fools,</hi> who scarce ever heard of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Histories, and never read their own. I shall therefore give some Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples (out of an infinite number) of People ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in'd and utterly destroy'd by their easie Credulity, and good Nature, matter of Fact being a stronger Proof, and better Rule to steer Mankind, than the empty Notions of the <hi>Schools,</hi> invented only to perplex and confound our Ratiocination, lest it should discover the naked Truth of things. The present Letter will confine it self only to Publick Promises, Oaths, and Solemn Contracts, scandalously violated by the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not with <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Hereticks</hi> only, but amongst themselves: We will begin with the more remote Countries.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Portugueses</hi> have acted so trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherously with the <hi>Africans,</hi> and the Natives of both <hi>Indies,</hi> that the Cruelty of the History would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible, if it was not related by their own Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians; their Leagues and Treaties (the most sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Bonds under Heaven) were soon neglected, and the Spirit of their Religion broke all before it; how many Millions of those innocent Creatures were murder'd in cold Blood, and for Pastime sake, with all the variety of Torments that the Devil could inspire into them; how soon were the vast Regions of <hi>Mexico,</hi> New <hi>Spain, Peru, Hispaniola, Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,</hi> &amp;c. depopulated, above twenty Millions of the poor harmless Inhabitants being put to death in full Peace, and they the best natur'd People in the World, and very Ingenious; tho' they may seem Savages to a sort of Men, who think all <hi>Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> that differ from them in Habits, Manners, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes, Diet, Religion, Language, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that all-wise Nature hath contriv'd a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Scene of things for various Climates; Nay, such is the Inhumanity of these <hi>Catholick</hi> Nations here at home, that they will frequently bring Strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers (settled amongst them by the Laws of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce) and their own fellow Subjects into the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> especially if they are Rich, upon a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of some Heretical opinion, tho' they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves at first protect and license the Opinion; as in the case of <hi>Molino,</hi> whose Book had receiv'd an <hi>Imprimatur</hi> from most of the <hi>Inquisitors</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> and even from the Infallible <hi>Head</hi> of the Church, yet afterwards it was burnt, and he himself together with many of his Followers mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably tortur'd; the <hi>Pope</hi> scarce escaping the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment. The Generous <hi>Marshal Schomberg</hi> (dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out of <hi>France</hi> for his great Services) who had won many Battels for the <hi>Portugueses,</hi> and sav'd their Country, could not be suffer'd to end his Old Age amongst them, but was forc'd in the midst of Winter to commit himself to the Sea, and fly to an inhospitable Shoar.</p>
            <p>The present <hi>French King</hi> renounced all his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences on <hi>Flanders,</hi> concluded the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Treaty, and swore at the Altar, not to meddle with that Country, but how well he observ'd that Sacred Covenant, <hi>Baron D' Isola</hi> will best inform you in his <hi>Bouclier d'Etat,</hi> for which he was thought to be poison'd; neither hath the <hi>French Monarch</hi> been contented to break all Faith and Measures with the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> but he hath gone about to deceive and ruine the <hi>Pope, Emperour,</hi> all the <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours</hi> of the Empire, the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> the <hi>Swizzes,</hi> the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and the <hi>English,</hi> and not only these his Neighbours and Allies, but his own Protestant Subjects, who had all the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity that Solemn <hi>Edicts, Oaths,</hi> and <hi>Promises</hi> could afford them, besides many other obligations upon the Crown for bringing the King to the Throne;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55685:2"/>
yet all of a sudden they found themselves oppress'd and destroy'd by his Apostolical <hi>Dragoons</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their Temples razed, their Wives and Children taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, their Goods and Estates confiscated, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves cast into Prisons, sent to the Gallies, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten shot at like Birds: His seising of <hi>Lorrain, Franch Compte, Alsace, Strasburgh, Luxemburgh,</hi> the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality of <hi>Orange,</hi> the County of <hi>Avignon, Philips<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg,</hi> the whole <hi>Palatinate,</hi> the Electorates of <hi>Mentz, Treves,</hi> and <hi>Cologn,</hi> his building of Cittadels in the <hi>Empire</hi> and in <hi>Italy,</hi> &amp;c. are so contradictory to National Agreements, and Publick Treaties, that scarce a <hi>Iesuit</hi> or a <hi>Frenchman</hi> can have Impudence enough to defend them; a <hi>Banditto,</hi> a <hi>Pyrate,</hi> or a <hi>Pick-pocket</hi> would be asham'd of such Actions; and an ordinary Man would be hang'd for a Crime a Million times less. His seising upon <hi>Hudson</hi>'s Bay, and leading the <hi>English</hi> into Slavery; the <hi>French</hi> Treachery in the Engagement at Sea between us and the <hi>Dutch,</hi> their frequent seizing of our Ships, are light things, not worthy our Resentment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the Conduct of a <hi>Monsieur</hi> whom the World so justly vilifies and despises.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Emperour</hi> can have no good Pretence to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> or any other <hi>Catholick</hi> Prince for breach of Common Faith and Honesty, since he himself hath plaid the same Game with his <hi>Protestant</hi> Subjects, inviting some of the Chief of the <hi>Hungarian</hi> Nobility to <hi>Vienna,</hi> under the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of Treaty and Friendship, and then cutting off their Heads, seizing their Estates and Properties, destroying their Pastors and Churches, and extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pating the whole Reform'd Religion, after he had promis'd and stipulated to protect and give them the liberty of their Consciences. The <hi>Parisian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacres</hi> were carried on and executed under a Mask of Friendship, all the Principal <hi>Protestants</hi> of <hi>France</hi> being invited to the healing Marriage, to Revel and Caress, were Barbarously Butcher'd at the Toll of a Bell in their Beds, when they dream'd they slept securely. The <hi>Irish Massacre</hi> of above 200000 <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants</hi> was no less Treacherous, it was a Copy of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Cruelty in the West <hi>Indies,</hi> to whom the <hi>Irish</hi> are compar'd by Historians for their Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Inhumanity, tho' not for their Wit.</p>
            <p>The Persecutions of the <hi>Protestants</hi> in the Valleys of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> are another instance of Popish Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and baseness; they were under the common shelter of publick Pactions and Treaties, and had been solemnly own'd by the <hi>Dukes</hi> of <hi>Savoy,</hi> to be the most Loyal and the most Couragious of their Subjects. The present <hi>Duke,</hi> who undertook this last Persecution, was not content to destroy them with his own Troops, but call'd in the <hi>French</hi> to assist at the Comedy, to shoot them off the Rocks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to hunt them over the <hi>Alps,</hi> and to sell the strongest of them to the Gallies, that the very <hi>Turkish</hi> Slaves themselves might deride and insult over them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Catholicks,</hi> who have not Power or Opportunity to execute the same things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> seem to condemn the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in Publick, but sing <hi>te Deum</hi> in Private, and as soon as ever they have got a sufficient Force, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the like Barbarities, so essential to their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that all the instinct of Nature cannot separate them. The Holy <hi>Father</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> (tho' he sets up for a moderate and merciful <hi>Pontificate</hi>) order'd <hi>te Deum</hi> to be Sung up and down, for the extirpation of Heresy out of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Piedmont</hi>; and our English <hi>Catholicks</hi> have given us (as their Army and Interest encreas'd) several proofs, how well they can juggle and disguise themselves; setting up Courts of <hi>Inquisition,</hi> turning <hi>Protestants</hi> out of all Employs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and even out of their Freeholds, dispensing with Laws, Ravishing Charters, packing Corporations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all under a notion of Liberty or a Divine Right; they with their <hi>Accomplices</hi> defended illegal Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and set up an Authority above all our Laws, under the Cloak of a sham Liberty of Conscience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> racking at the very same time the Consciences of the Church of <hi>England</hi> Men, and undermining the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of our State: If Mr. <hi>Pen</hi> and his <hi>Disciples,</hi> had condemn'd the unlawfulness of the <hi>Declarations</hi> and the Dispensing Power, when they wrote so fast for Liberty of Conscience, they had then shew'd a generous zeal for a just Freedome in Matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and at the same time a due veneration to the <hi>Legislative</hi> Power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>(Kings, Lords,</hi> and <hi>Commons)</hi> but the secret of the <hi>Machine,</hi> was to Maintain and Erect a <hi>Prerogative</hi> above all Acts of <hi>Parliament,</hi> and consequently to introduce upon that bottom <hi>Tyranny</hi> and <hi>Popery</hi>; yet, notwithstanding all this uncontroulable Power, and shew of Grandeur, an Easterly Wind, and a Fleet of Fly-Boats, would cancel and undo all again. Our <hi>Monkish</hi> Historians relate of <hi>King Iohn,</hi> that being in some distress, he sent Sir <hi>Tho. Hardington,</hi> and Sir <hi>Ralph Fitz-Nichols,</hi> Ambassadours to <hi>Mirammumalim</hi> the great Emperour of <hi>Morocco,</hi> with offers of his Kingdom to him, upon Condition he would come and aid him, and that if he prevail'd, he would himself turn <hi>Mahometan</hi> and renounce <hi>Popery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will not insist upon the violations of Laws and Treaties in the Low <hi>Countries,</hi> or the <hi>Spanish</hi> Tyranny over them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have got so much by that Persecution and Cruelty, that they might be tempted to practise the like again; for by forcing the <hi>Netherlanders</hi> to take up Arms for their defence, and by necessitating <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi> to assist and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve them, they have set up a Free and Glorious <hi>State</hi> (as they themselves have call'd them in some Treaties) that hath preserv'd the languishing Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Liberty of <hi>Christendome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Base and Cowardly <hi>Massacre</hi> of that great <hi>Hero William Prince of Orange,</hi> of the Renowned Admiral <hi>Coligny,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>; the many Bloody Conspiracies for the Extirpation of the whole Race

            <p>The Reign of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> is another Scene of the Infidelity and Treachery of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> what Oaths did she take, what Promises and Protestations did she make to the <hi>Suffolk</hi> Men who had set the Crown upon her Head, and yet they were the first that felt the strokes of a Persecution from <hi>Her.</hi> Read her History in <hi>Fox</hi>'s <hi>Martyrs,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Burnet</hi>'s History of the Reformation.</p>
            <p>The many Conspiracies to destroy Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> and King <hi>Iames,</hi> the <hi>Gunpowder-Plot,</hi> the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels carried on in Popish Countries to take off King <hi>Charles</hi> the First, and the many late Popish Plots are a continued Series and Thred, carried on by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to break thro all Laws both of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> to erect an Universal <hi>Monarchy</hi> of <hi>Priest-Craft,</hi> and to bring the whole World under their Yoke. The <hi>Sweeds</hi> have taken an effectual and commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble way, to keep Popish <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Iesuits</hi> (those <hi>Boutefeus</hi> and disturbers of Societies, the declared Enemies to the Welfare of Mankind) out of their Countries, by Gelding them, and consequently ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring them incapable of Sacerdotal Functions, tho the <hi>Priests</hi> have found out a <hi>Salvo,</hi> and will say Mass and Confess, if they can procure their <hi>Testicles</hi> again, and carry them in their Pockets either preserv'd or in Powder: In <hi>Aethiopia, China,</hi> and <hi>Iapan,</hi> the Roman <hi>Priests</hi> have been so intollerably turbulent, and such extravagant Incendiaries, that they have been often Banished and put to Death; so that now they disguise themselves all over the <hi>Eastern</hi> Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, under the Names and Characters of <hi>Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians, Mechanics, Physitians, &amp;c.</hi> and dare not own their Mission to propagate a <hi>Faith,</hi> which is grown ridiculous all over <hi>Asia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The long and dreadful Civil Wars of <hi>France,</hi> the many <hi>Massacres</hi> and <hi>Persecutions,</hi> and lastly the Siege of <hi>Rochel,</hi> are living Instances how far we may rely upon Engagements and Laws, both as to the taking of that <hi>Bulwark,</hi> and the promised relief from hence, The <hi>Protestant</hi> Defenders of it, refusing to rely any longer upon Paper Edicts, and the word of a Most <hi>Christian King,</hi> had this <hi>City</hi> granted them as a cautionary Town for their Security, for before they had alwaies been deluded out of their Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages by fair Promises, insignificant Treaties, and the word of a King; yet <hi>Lewis</hi> the 13. following the vitious Examples of Treacherous Princes, fell upon this Glorious <hi>City,</hi> which, upon the account of their Laws and Priviledges, made a resistance and brave defence, (having never heard of Passive Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience amongst their Pastors) thinking it more lawful to defend their Rights, than it was for <hi>Lewis</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade them.</p>
            <p>As for the late and present <hi>Reign</hi> here in <hi>England,</hi> they are too nice and tender things for me to touch; whether the <hi>Transactions</hi> of them are consistant with the <hi>Coronation Oaths,</hi> the many <hi>Declarations, Protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> publick and solemn Promises, I am no fit Judge; they are more proper for the Gravity of an Historian, or the Authority of a <hi>Parliament</hi> to handle, than for a private Gentleman in a Letter to his Friend: The Bishops Papers, and the P. of <hi>Orange</hi>'s <hi>Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> are the best <hi>Memoirs</hi> of them, but they only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, where the two parts of the History of the growth of <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary</hi> Government left off, and how far we may trust to <hi>Catholick</hi> Stipulations, Oaths and Treaties, the facts of past and the present Age are the best <hi>Criterions</hi> and Rules to guide and determine us; for what happens every day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will in all probability happen to morrow, the same Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses alwaies produce the same Effects; and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is still the same Church it was a hundred years ago, that is, a Mass of Treachery, Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Perjury, and the highest Superstition; a <hi>Machine</hi> without any principle or setled Law of Motion, not to be mov'd or stopt with the weights of any private or publick <hi>Obligations</hi>; a <hi>Monster</hi> that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroys all that is sacred both in Heaven and Earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so Ravenous that it is never content, unless it gets the whole World into its Claws, and tears all to pieces in order to Salvation; a <hi>Proteus</hi> that turns it self into all shapes, a <hi>Chameleon</hi> that puts on all Colours according to its present circumstances, this day an <hi>Angel</hi> of Light, to morrow a <hi>Belzebub.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst all the <hi>Courts</hi> of <hi>Christendome</hi> where I have Conversed, that of <hi>Holland</hi> is the freest from Tricks and Falsehood; and tho' I am naturally jealous and suspitious of the Conduct of <hi>Princes,</hi> yet I could never discover the least Knavery within those Walls, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd to me another <hi>Athens</hi> of <hi>Philosophers,</hi> and the only Seat of <hi>Iustice</hi> and <hi>Vertue</hi> now left in the World; as for the Character of the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange,</hi> it is so faithfully drawn by Sir <hi>Will. Temple,</hi> Doctor <hi>Burnet,</hi> and in a half sheet lately Printed, that I, who am so averse from Flattery, that I can scarce speak a good word of any Body, or think one good thought of my self, will not write any further <hi>Panegyrick</hi> upon his <hi>Highness,</hi> only that he is a very Honest <hi>Man,</hi> a Great <hi>Souldier,</hi> and a Wise <hi>Prince,</hi> upon whose Word the World may safely rely. A late <hi>Pamphle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teer</hi> reviles the <hi>Prince</hi> with breaking his Oath when he took the <hi>Statholder</hi>'s Office upon him, not consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that the Oath was impos'd upon his <hi>Highness</hi> in his <hi>Minority</hi> by a <hi>French Faction,</hi> then jealous of the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55685:3"/>
aspiring and true Grandeur of his <hi>Young Soul</hi>; that the <hi>States</hi> themselves (to whom the Obligation was made) freed his <hi>Highness</hi> from the Bond; and that the necessity of Affairs, and the Importunities of the <hi>People</hi> forced that Dignity upon him, which his <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors</hi> had enjoy'd, and <hi>he</hi> so well deserv'd, that <hi>he</hi> sav'd the sinking Commonwealth (their <hi>Provinces</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing almost all Surpriz'd and Enslav'd by the <hi>French</hi>) compared to the gasping State of <hi>Rome</hi> after the loss at <hi>Cannae</hi>; His <hi>Highness</hi> was no more puft up with this Success, than he had been daunted with Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships and Misfortunes; alwaies the same <hi>Hero,</hi> Just, Serene, and Unchang'd under all Events, an Argument of the vastness of his Mind; whereas on the contrary, Mutability, (sometimes <hi>Tyrant,</hi> sometimes <hi>Father</hi> of a Country, sometimes Huffing, other times Sneaking) is oftentime a Symptome of a Mean and Cowardly <hi>Soul,</hi> vile and dissolute, born for Rapine and Destruction.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Princess,</hi> she may without any flattery be stiled the Honour and Glory of her Sex; the most Knowing, the most Virtuous, the Fairest, and yet the best Natur'd <hi>Princess</hi> in the World; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd and Admir'd by her Enemies, never seen in any Passion, always under a peculiar Sweetness of Temper, extremely moderate in her Pleasures, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing delight in Working and in Study, Humble and Affable in her Conversation, very pertinent in all Questions, Charitable to all <hi>Protestants,</hi> and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting their Churches: The <hi>Prince</hi> is often seen with her at the Prayers of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and she with the <hi>Prince,</hi> at the Devotion of his <hi>Church</hi>; she dispenses with the use of the Surplice, Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Altar, and the Name of <hi>Iesus,</hi> out of Compliance to a <hi>Country</hi> that adores her; being more intent upon the Intrinsick and Substantial Parts of Religion, <hi>Prayer</hi> and Good <hi>Works:</hi> She speaks several Languages even to Perfection, is entirely Obedient to the <hi>Prince,</hi> and <hi>he</hi> extremely dear to her; in a word, <hi>She</hi> is a <hi>Princess</hi> of many extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Virtues and Excellencies, without any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Vanity, or the least mixture of Vice; and upon whose Promise the World may safely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend: As for the many Plots and Conspiracies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this <hi>Royal Couple</hi> a short time may bring them all to light, and faithful Historians publish them to the World.</p>
            <p>Lastly, We may observe that whereas it hath been the Maxim of several Kings, both at home and abroad of late years, to contend and ourvie each other in Preying upon, and Destroying not only their Neighbours, but their own <hi>Protestant</hi> Subjects, by all methods of Perfidiousness and Cruelty; the only way to establish Tyranny, and to enslave the natural Freedom of Mankind, being to introduce a general Ignorance, Superstition, and Idolatry; for if once People can be perswaded that Statues and Idols are <hi>Divinities</hi> and adorable, and that a Wafer is the <hi>Infinite God,</hi> after two or three Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Words, utter'd by a vile Impostor and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent Cheat, then they may easily be brought to submit their necks to all the Yokes that a Tyrant and a Priest can invent and put upon them; for if once they part with their Reason, their Liberty will soon follow; as we behold every day in the misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enslav'd Countries where <hi>Popery</hi> domineers. On the contrary, it hath always been the steddy and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable Principle of the House of <hi>Orange</hi> to rescue <hi>Europe</hi> from its Oppressours, and to resettle Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon the Primitive and Immortal Foundation of <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Property</hi>; a Glorious Maxim, taken from the Old <hi>Roman Commonwealth,</hi> that Fought and Conquer'd so many Nations, only to set them Free, to Restore them wholsome Laws, their Natural and Civil Liberties; a Design so Generous, and every way Great, that the <hi>East</hi> groaning under the Fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Oppressions of their Tyrants, flew in to the <hi>Roman Eagles</hi> for Shelter and Protection, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whose Wings the several Nations liv'd Free, Safe and Happy, till Traitours and Usurpers began to break in upon the Sacred Laws of that vertuous <hi>Constitution,</hi> and to keep up Armies to defend that by Blood and Rapine, which <hi>Iustice</hi> would have thrown in their Face, and Punished them as they deserved; the Preservation and Welfare of the <hi>People</hi> being in all Ages call'd the Supreme <hi>Law,</hi> to which all the rest ought to tend.</p>
            <p>From the foregoing Relation of matter of Fact, it appears most plain, that the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> are not to be ty'd by Laws, Treaties, Promises, Oaths, or any other bonds of Humane Society; the sad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of this and other <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> declares to all Mankind the invalidity and insignificancy of all <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts</hi> and <hi>Agreements</hi> with the <hi>Papists,</hi> who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all their Solemn <hi>Covenants</hi> with <hi>Hereticks,</hi> do watch for all Advantages and Opportunities to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy them, being commanded thereunto by their <hi>Councils</hi> and the principles of their <hi>Church,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stigated by their <hi>Priests.</hi>
