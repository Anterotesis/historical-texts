            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Heaven and Hell muſt final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſhew the difference for
ever: And to reconcile them
is as unpoſſible, as to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
Light and Darkneſs. I
know that it is the endeavour of every faithful
Miniſter of Chriſt, to make this difference plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
known, and in Doctrine and Diſcipline to
ſeparate the precious from the vile; and to
make ungodly men know that they are ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and to give to each their proper portion,
and to keep the Churches as clean as they can
by lawful means. I know that the ruine of
this purging and differencing Diſcipline, is a
great part of the lamentable ruine of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:63037:7"/>
and occaſioneth that ſcandal to the Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans
and Heathens, becauſe of the wicked
lives of Chriſtians, which is one of the greateſt
hinderances of their converſion: And that all
Chriſtians ſhould uſe their utmoſt skill and
power, to recover Religion to its primitive Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and Splendour, and Diſcipline to the moſt
effectual regular exerciſe. And I know that
in mens private converſe there muſt be a great
care what company we converſe with, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
whom we make our familiars. And that
to be <hi>indifferent,</hi> and to intimate an equality
or likeneſs of the <hi>godly</hi> and the <hi>wicked,</hi> in <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
communion,</hi> and <hi>familiarity,</hi> is a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
ſign of an ungodly perſon. And upon
theſe accounts, I know that when perſons are
newly recovered from ungodlineſs themſelves,
they are very much inclined to fly from the
company of ſuch, as far as their ſafety doth
require: And by this inclination and their ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
they are frequently tempted to go fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from them in Church communion, than God
alloweth them to do, and inſtead of ſeparating
from them in their ſin, to ſeparate from them
in their duty; and to ſeparate from the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of Chriſt in his true worſhip, becauſe of the
mixture and preſence of the bad.</p>
            <p>And this they are drawn to, 1. By forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the <hi>Scripture pattern,</hi> and ſtate of the
Churches even in the <hi>pureſt age,</hi> and thinking
only what <hi>they deſire,</hi> rather than what is to
be expected or done.</p>
            <p>2. By forgetting the <hi>difference</hi> between the
<hi>Church viſible,</hi> which is alwayes mixt with
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:63037:7"/>
Hypocrites and offenders, and the <hi>Church invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible</hi>
which ſhall all be ſaved.</p>
            <p>3. By forgetting the difference between their
<hi>private familiarity,</hi> where they are chooſers
of their company themſelves; and their <hi>Church
communion,</hi> where the <hi>Paſtors</hi> are the Rulers
and Judges of the fitneſs of the members. Or
elſe not underſtanding that <hi>this uſe of the
Keyes,</hi> and judging of the fitneſs of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
is indeed the <hi>Paſtors Office,</hi> and not
theirs.</p>
            <p>4. By not conſidering that nothing muſt be
done by Diſcipline upon Offenders, but in a
courſe of <hi>Church-Juſtice,</hi> upon <hi>due Accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Summons, Audience, Proof</hi> and <hi>patient
Admonition:</hi> And not by caſting out any ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularly
upon the expectation of every one
that will ſay that they are ungodly and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous.</p>
            <p>5. By forgetting the great difference between

with them in their <hi>duty</hi> in which they
ſhould be encouraged.</p>
            <p>6. By forgetting the great difference of

            <p>7. By forgetting that God will have all

to have more hand in their Welfare or Miſery,
than other mens: And if they <hi>miſchooſe,</hi> the

            <p>8. By forgetting that God hath not left the
Church at arbitrary liberty to judge any <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:63037:8"/>
or <hi>Ungodly</hi> at their pleaſure; But hath
given us a ſet Teſt or Rule to judge them by;
which is <hi>[their ſober Profeſſion of Conſent
to the Baptiſmal Covenant;</hi> upon which the
Adult and their Infants have right to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm;
And being <hi>Baptized</hi> have Right to
Church Communion in all the Acts which their
<hi>Age</hi> and <hi>Underſtanding</hi> makes them capable
of: And it is Church-tyranny to refuſe ſuch
as ſhew <hi>this Title,</hi> till they are openly proved
to forfeit it, by <hi>Impenitency</hi> in groſs ſin after
publick admonition, and due means. This is
the truth, and the method of Chriſts diſcipline,
and the Rule of our Communion.</p>
            <p>9. By ſuperſtitious placing their Religion in
indifferent and undertermined things, and laying
a greater ſtreſs on the <hi>words</hi> of <hi>prayer,</hi> than
there is cauſe. Overvaluing their ſeveral out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
forms, expreſſions and orders, in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping
of God: when inſtead of provoking
each other to faith and fervency to Love and
to good works, they place more of Godlineſs in
<hi>words</hi> and <hi>circumſtances</hi> (which God hath
certainly left free to every mans conſcience)
than God doth place in them: And one thinks
that he is irregular, that prayeth without a
ſet form, and another that he is ungodly, that
prayeth not by the Spirit, who uſeth a ſet
form; when both do but ſpeak their own <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition,</hi>
and make Laws and Rules which
God never made. Superſtition and our own
additions in Religion (even in thoſe that cry
out much againſt it) is the occaſion of moſt of
our Church-diviſions. One ſide ſuppoſeth eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:63037:8"/>
diſorder or unfit expreſſion in <hi>free prayer</hi> to
be a greater fault than indeed it is: And that
its unlawful therefore to joyn with a Church
that hath no ſet forms: Another party ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth
the forms in the Church Lyturgy to be
worſe than they are; and that it is unlawful
to joyn in them, or to receive the Lords Supper
when they are uſed. When as God hath nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
tyed us <hi>to</hi> ſet forms, nor <hi>from</hi> them; ſave
only as unſuitableneſs to any particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
may make one leſs edifying than the other:
And both <hi>free prayers,</hi> and <hi>ſet forms, ſtudied
prayers,</hi> and <hi>ſudden prayers,</hi> are all the <hi>work
of man,</hi> (as to mans part): and therefore
they muſt needs be imperfect and faulty as man
is: And yet in both we may pray by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
even with the holy and fervent deſires
which the Spirit exciteth in us: And the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
may ordinarily be a Spirit of ſupplication
in us, and help our infirmities, in the one
way and in the other: And therefore, though
I will not <hi>equall</hi> them (For I prefer ſome
mens <hi>free praying</hi> before any forms, and I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the Common prayers before ſome mens <hi>free
prayers</hi>) yet I may ſay, that I will neither
Aſſent and Conſent to every word in the one,
nor in the other, no not of any man that ever
I heard: And yet I will not take it for unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to joyn with Church, or Family, or perſon
in the <hi>one,</hi> or in <hi>the other:</hi> yea, upon long
experience, if I had fully my own choice and
liberty, I would uſe <hi>free prayer</hi> one part of
the day (or one day) and a well compoſed
form another part, becauſe I ſee commodities
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63037:9"/>
by both, and ſuch inconveniences of either way
alone, as are, if poſſible to be avoided. But
when the Mind hath received a prejudice againſt
<hi>either way,</hi> by Education, Cuſtom, or former
diſtaſtes, no reaſon how clear ſoever will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
it, till age and experience do mellow
green and ſowre Spirits, and teach them to
judge of things ſoberly and impartially, not
as others judge of them, but as indeed they
are.</p>
            <p>10. And men are much furthered in the way
of ſeparation, by forgetting what good even hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites
themſelves, may receive by their ſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the viſible Church: And that it is not
for nothing that the Great Maſter of the Church,
hath ſo ordered the terms of admiſſion (upon
<hi>meer Profeſſion of Conſent to the Baptiſmal
Covenant</hi>) and of Excluſion (upon <hi>proved
Impenitency in groſs ſin after ſufficient ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition
and patience</hi>) as that multitudes
of bad men ever have been and will be in the
viſible Church: Though the regular ſtation that
ſuch perſons ſhould chooſe, till they come up
to ſincere conſent, is the place of Catechumens,
if they were not baptized in Infancy, and the
place of <hi>Penitents</hi> if they were, yet ſuppoſing
that they intrude further by a falſe profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
yet God hath provided great advantages,
in Church communion for their good, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
the innocent from imputation of ſin, by
reaſon of their preſence.</p>
            <p>11. And men are induced to ſeparation by
forgetting, how tender Chriſt is of the weakeſt
of his members, that are ſincere, and that he
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:63037:9"/>
had rather many hypocrites were received, than
one true Chriſtian ſhut out: For he hath a
day at hand, in which he will ſeparate the
Tares from the Wheat, and will take out of
his Kingdom all things that offend, and them
that work iniquity. And they conſider not
how impoſſible it is, to ſhut out all hypocrites,
and not to ſhut out many weak ones that are
ſincere.</p>
            <p>12. And it much wrongeth them that they
forget what a Mercy it is, that Chriſt hath not
made the power of the Paſtors or Church to be
arbitrary, in admiſſions or excluſions; but hath
tyed them up to certain terms, and preſcribed
to them whom to Receive or Reject: And that
they conſider not, what confuſions otherwiſe
would be brought into the Church, and what
Church-tyranny men would exerciſe; And how
the difference of mens <hi>Judgements, Intereſts,
Temptations</hi> and <hi>Paſſions,</hi> would make almoſt
as many ſorts of Churches, as there are indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual
Governours and Churches. And one
would make one meaſure, and another another
meaſure of their communion.</p>
            <p>13. And it greatly wrongeth ſuch men that
they never had right apprehenſions of the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
and <hi>great Neceſſity</hi> of <hi>Vanity</hi> among be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
and the Churches of Chriſt. They cry
out <hi>Truth muſt not be ſold for Peace,</hi> when
they neither know aright what is <hi>Truth</hi> or
<hi>Peace.</hi> But by <hi>Truth</hi> they mean their own
doubtful opinions, and by <hi>Peace</hi> they mean
their own quietneſs with men. We eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,
that as <hi>Peace</hi> ſignifieth our freedom from
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:63037:10"/>
perſecution or ſufferings, or from the reproach
of men, the leaſt holy truth is to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it, and more tenaciouſly held than it: But
if by <hi>Peace,</hi> they mean the <hi>Unity</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord</hi>
of believers, or of the Church of God,
they ſpeak dangerouſly, and ſuppoſe a pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
falſhood, that <hi>Gods Truth,</hi> and ſuch <hi>Peace</hi>
or <hi>Concord,</hi> may at any time be ſeparated:
And it is no wiſelier ſpoken, than if they had
ſaid, <hi>A mans eye-ſight or health is to be
preferred before the Union of his ſoul and
body, or before the Concord of Head and
Heart,</hi> or before the <hi>conjunction of his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</hi>
When as <hi>non cutis nulla eſt affectio.</hi>
Deſtroy the <hi>Subject,</hi> and you deſtroy the <hi>Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents.</hi>
Without <hi>union</hi> of <hi>parts,</hi> the Church
is no Church; Dividing it, is deſtroying it.
A Houſe or Kingdom divided, cannot ſtand.
And when it is no Church, it hath no <hi>Truth</hi> as
a Church, n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r any thing that dividers did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
for. An Integral member may rather
be cut off, than the whole ſhould periſh: But
what member will ſeparate it ſelf from the
b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dy? Or who but a murderer will on pretence
of curing, be a divider and diſſolver?</p>
            <p>14. And it wrongeth theſe Chriſtians much
that they look on the narrow ſpace of the
Churches about them, and forget the ſtate of
almoſt all Chriſts Churches in the whole world,
which are in a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> worſe condition than our
Pariſh Churches are: which though it ſhould
draw no man to like the leaſt imperfection in
them or in himſelf, nor to neglect any true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
duty, yet would it make a tender
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:63037:10"/>
Chriſtian rather tremblingly to return to Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
due Communion, than to dare to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
from almoſt all Chriſts viſible body upon
earth.</p>
            <p>15. And gazing all upon one ſide, doth
make men forget, how heinous an injury it is
to Chriſt, to rob him of the greateſt part of his
Churches, and to ſay, that they are none of
his: when they could eaſily perceive that it
would not be well taken by the King, if they
ſhould ſay, that he is <hi>King</hi> of no more, but
three or four Villages in the Land: And he
that can take four parts, yea, nineteen parts
of Chriſts Church from him to day, may take
away the fifth or the twentieth to morrow,
and ſo may turn Infidels, and deny Chriſt to be
Chriſt: For no Kingdom, no King.</p>
            <p>16. And they forget that as the Body muſt
have its due <hi>magnitude,</hi> as well as its <hi>come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſcite</hi> of parts; ſo we muſt be zealous for the
<hi>Greatneſs,</hi> as well as the <hi>Purity,</hi> the <hi>Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive</hi>
as well as the <hi>Intenſive</hi> growth of the
Church. And if Chriſts flock be little, they
diſhonour it that would make it tenfold leſs
than indeed it is; Jer. 30. 19. <hi>And out of
them ſhall proceed thanksgiving, and the
voice of them that make merry: And I will
multiply them, and they ſhall not be few,
and I will glorifie them, and they ſhall not
be ſmall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>17. And the <hi>Paſſion</hi> that is kindled in men by
their ſufferings, is very ſtrong in conquering
their judgements; ſo that too few in the whole
world are found ſo ſober, as not to go too far
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:63037:11"/>
from thoſe they ſuffer by; unleſs it be timerous
or temporizing complyers, that yield to eſcape
their further ſuffering.</p>
            <p>18. And men are ſtrangely forgetful of the
experiences of themſelves and others: And
when God hath let looſe the Spirit of diviſion
to the confuſions both of State and Churches,
and to the ruining of true Reformation, and
to the woful and ſcandalous diſſolution of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
particular Churches, where it hath come,
yet will not men underſtand or remember, but
ſee as if they did not ſee. <hi>Holland, England,
New England</hi> give them loud and lamentable
warnings, and yet they will not hear.</p>
            <p>19. And they that know what man is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
will not deny, but that in very many,
there is ſomething of that <hi>Pride</hi> (which ſome
call <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> but is too <hi>carnal</hi>) in mens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
to ſeparation. He that knoweth how
excellent a thing it is to be <hi>Wiſe,</hi> and <hi>Holy,</hi>
and <hi>Happy,</hi> is oft tempted to be deſirous that his
own excellency ſhould appear, and not be hid
by his joyning with ſuch as are taken for ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
common men; and ſo would ſtand fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from the common ſort of viſible Chriſtians,
than God would have him. And alſo ſome
perſons, who ſhould find the Evidences of Gods
favour and acceptance in the life of <hi>Faith,
and Love, and Holineſs,</hi> do lamentably quiet
themſelves inſtead of theſe, with being mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of ſuch ſtrict ſocieties, as profeſs even a
ſeparating conſpicuous holineſs.</p>
            <p>20. Laſtly, But one of the greateſt ſnares of
all is, that men cannot bear the Cenſures of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:63037:11"/>
thoſe that are inclined to <hi>Separation.</hi> And
therefore rather than be accounted and called by
them <hi>Formaliſts, Temporizers, Carnal,</hi> or
ſuch like, they will do as they do, and turn
their zeal into partial and unjuſt cenſures, of
the perſons, words, and outward Modes and
Circumſtances of Worſhip, of thoſe that they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
from.</p>
            <p>Theſe and ſuch other cauſes of Dividing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations,
I did (upon the ſpecial neceſſities
of the Churches, and ſome of my own acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance)
lay open in a Book called the <hi>Cure of
Church Diviſions;</hi> which made a great noiſe,
(as water powred upon the flames); But
though ſome upon miſunderſtanding, and ſome
by guilt and intereſt muttered much againſt
it, I never had a word againſt it privately or
publickly in writing, by way of Confutation
of any thing in it, ſave only a Libell of one
that now calleth himſelf <hi>Edward Bagſhaw,</hi> a
man that I am not acquainted with, though I
have ſeen and ſpoken with him, and though to
my trouble, when his fancy led him that way,
he unskilfully wrote for me againſt the Biſhop
then of <hi>Worceſter.</hi> I greatly rejoyce that in
theſe times of tryal, ſo few of the Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
Miniſters are by ſufferings and paſſions
hurried into the dividing extream. If inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
or intereſt would excuſe any ſin, I think
there are few Miniſters in <hi>England,</hi> who have
more inducements to the angry ſeparating way
than I have. But ſhall I therefore wrong the
Truth and Church of God, and my own and
others ſouls! God forbid.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:63037:12"/>
Brethren, it is none of my meaning to
diſoblige you from your ancient faithful
Miniſters. Nor yet to perſwade you to
hear any <hi>inſufficient</hi> or <hi>intolerable man;</hi>
much leſs to commit your ſouls to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoral
care of ſuch a perſon: nor yet to
prefer a <hi>worſe</hi> before a <hi>better,</hi> who may upon
<hi>lawful terms</hi> be enjoyed. But the things that
I perſwade you to, are theſe: 1. Not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
falſe uncharitable dividing principles
in your minds, which will break the peace
of all ſocieties.</p>
            <p>2. If you differ about Infant Baptiſm, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>depencie,
Common prayer or ſuch like, that yet
you will not think your differences oblige you
to deny Communion to all you differ from.</p>
            <p>3. That if you are ſo ſinfully partial, that
you cannot joyn in the ſame Churches, you
would yet live charitably and peaceably in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Churches.</p>
            <p>4. That you would not ſay any Church of
Chriſt is No Church, becauſe it is not of your
form or mode.</p>
            <p>5. That you would not ſay, that Communion
with any Church is unlawful, becauſe their
external worſhipping form, is not of your faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or before you have proved what you ſay.
My advice is calculated to the Vnion and
peace of all true Churches, and not thoſe of one
form or mode alone.</p>
            <p>And I note it as a conſiderable providence
of God, that I am drawn in to defend the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Love and Concord in theſe trying
times, againſt ſuch an adverſary as Mr. <hi>Bagſhaw</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:63037:12"/>
is. It hath of late been Gods way to let us
know the <hi>evil of Principles</hi> by their <hi>effects</hi> on
the men that we have had to do with: As <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant
principles</hi> would not have been ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
diſtaſted by us, if they had not ſhewed
themſelves in <hi>malignant practices;</hi> So <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
principles</hi> had never been ſufficiently
known in <hi>England,</hi> if they had not ruined a
Reformation, ſilenced ſo many hundred Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
and laid us in the dirt, as they have
done. And if the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of <hi>Dividers</hi> muſt be
judged of by the <hi>defenders,</hi> I adviſe you to
conſider of theſe things following.</p>
            <p>1. How many notorious falſe doctrines he
hath delivered?</p>
            <p>2. How many other notorious Crimes in two
Libells he hath committed? In ſpecial let every
ſober perſon judge, whether <hi>Ignorance, Teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
Pride</hi> and <hi>high ſelf-conceitedneſs</hi> with
<hi>malignant</hi> unconcealed <hi>calumny</hi> do not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file,
but even conſtitute or make up his
Books?</p>
            <p>3. What bitter enmity is here expreſt againſt
the Principles of Love, and Vnity, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
and Peace, and Sobriety it ſelf?</p>
            <p>4. How many ſcore notorious untruths he
ſhameleſly publiſheth in theſe two Libells?</p>
            <p>5. How much he fighteth againſt Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and ſo with groſs Impenitency aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vateth
all his crimes?</p>
            <p>6. How like his own Spirit is to that which
he accounteth the <hi>Spirit of impoſition and
perſecution?</hi> And how vehement he is againſt
the ſame perſons as ſuch are, and as impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:63037:13"/>
ſlandereth them, and as bitterly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly
deſigneth to make them odious (But he
that profeſſeth to make another odious, thereby
diſableth himſelf from doing it.)</p>
            <p>7. Whether ever in all your lives, you ſaw
two Libells written againſt another, which do
not only <hi>perform,</hi> but even <hi>attempt</hi> ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
and next to nothing at all, to give any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to the Books he writes againſt. Read
mine and read his, and I defie any thing but
madneſs it ſelf, or blind partiality or wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
to make any man think that he hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed
what I have written. I confeſs I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
at the mans inſenſibility, that doth not
perceive, how much he hath done, by pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an Anſwer, and giving none, or worſe than
none, to make his cauſe or himſelf contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Can any man in his wits think, that he
hath confuted the Principles of Concord which
I laid down in my Directions.</p>
            <p>8. Whether ſuch a man as this do ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
wiſer than <hi>Dod, Hilderſham, Ames, Baine,</hi>
and all the old Non-conformiſts according to
the importance of his boaſt? or whether he
give us cauſe to believe that God hath revealed
more to him than to them, while he himſelf can
no better reveal it unto others?</p>
            <p>9. When I had ſet down at leaſt thirty three
Vntruths which he deliberately dared to write
and publiſh, did you ever read ſuch a pittiful
vindication? He hath not ſpoken to any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
number of them: And of thoſe few
that he ſpeaketh to, try if you can find any
one of which he cleareth himſelf? And yet he
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:63037:13"/>
profeſſeth not repentance for any one of them?
Nay, to open his Impenitency, he profeſſeth
falſly that I cannot juſtly charge him with any
of them; and addeth in the laſt Libell forty
eight palpable Vntruths more? Juſt like one
that being accuſed of ſwearing, ſhould forty
eight times ſwear that he never ſware.</p>
            <p>10. How far he proceedeth in his ſeparation,
and how far he would draw poor unſtable
ſouls? It is not only from the Conformiſts and
the Pariſh Churches that he would have you
ſeparate, and all in the whole world that are
worſe than they; but alſo from all the Non-conformiſts
in <hi>England,</hi> that are not better than
I: as his concluding Advertiſement fully tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
you. All of my mind and meaſure are
unworthy of the communion of this <hi>humble,
tender, credible</hi> man.</p>
            <p>11. What means is there left in the world to
exempt a man from the malignant calumnies
of this Judge of the Churches? When in one
ſentence he telleth you, how much I have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
againſt the Biſhops, and in another that I
am in the ſame condemnation with him, and
yet in another, that I dare look no truth in
the face, that bringeth ſuffering; when
he talks of one point that all Chriſtians are
agreed in, and directly bringeth none. And
when he chargeth me with <hi>Atheiſtical arguing
againſt the divine and ſelf-evidencing au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Scripture, and therefore to be
Rejected of all, as one of the worſt ſort of
Hereticks, that under the notion of being a
Chriſtian and a Proteſtant, doth with his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:63037:14"/>
induſtry and cunning, labour to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
our foundation.]</hi> When I know of
no one man living in this Age, that hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<hi>ſo much</hi> (I ſay not, <hi>ſo well</hi>) for the
things in queſtion (Scripture and Chriſtianity)
as I have done. May not this man as modeſtly
charge Biſhop <hi>Downame</hi> to be a Papiſt, that
hath written ſo much to prove the Pope to be
Antichriſt? or ſay any thing elſe that he hath
liſt to ſay?</p>
            <p>12. Doth he not fix upon you by ſuch Libells
as theſe, an odious reproach? As if he would
perſwade the world, that you that he writeth to,
are ſo partial, ſo blind, ſo falſe to truth, and
to your own ſouls, and ſuch pernicious ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to peace, as that you will receive that
which is thus falſly ſaid to you, without ever read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what is ſaid on the other ſide, or againſt all
the evidence that contradicteth it, and will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
all theſe viſible untruths of his, without
any proof, upon the bare report of ſo raſh a
man.</p>
            <p>13. Whether following ſuch men and wayes
as this, is not the likelieſt way in the world,
not only to increaſe the reproach of the Non-conformiſts,
and make them all thought of, as
we do of the Quakers, and ſo to continue ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verities
againſt them as a company of furious
unſociable perſons; but alſo to harden men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a contempt of Religion it ſelf.</p>
            <p>14. Doth not God permit ſuch a Champion
of the Cauſe of Diviſion, thus criminally to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry,
that you may ſee that you are not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than thoſe you ſeparate from? You blame
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:63037:14"/>
them for ſubſcribing erroneouſly or falſly; And
which of them hath put thirty three, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
eight viſible untruths deliberatly in print,
and Impenitently ſtands in them as your Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion
hath done? Doth not this ſhew you, that
you are not ſo good, but that the Churches of
godly Paſtors are as worthy of your Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as you are of theirs? If one ſhould admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
one of your Church-members of one ſingle
deliberate avowed lye, would you not call him
to Repentance? And will you believe this man
and follow him upon his bare word, who hath
publiſhed eighty ſuch falſhoods? Yet I am not
one that think he loveth a lye, becauſe it is a
lye; but one that is thus guilty through proud
overvaluing his own unfurniſhed underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and through an extraordinary <hi>Raſhneſs</hi>
and want of <hi>tenderneſs</hi> of <hi>Conſcience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You have heretofore had better Guides, and
you have better ſtill: (I never met with two
Miniſters that approve his Libell, nor any but
Mr. <hi>Browne</hi> alone) you have a more peaceable
Rule; And if you are Chriſtians indeed, you
have a Peaceable Spirit, and a Saviour, who is
the Prince of peace (who hath prayed that all
his Diſciples may be one, <hi>John</hi> 17. 21.) and a
God who is the God of peace. Follow therefore
the Wiſdom that is both <hi>Pure</hi> and <hi>Peaceable,</hi>
and not that from beneath, which is earthly,
ſenſual and deviliſh, and worketh by envious
zeal and ſtrife, unto confuſion and every evil

               <p>HAving told you in my firſt Admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>p.</hi> 145. that <hi>if you write any more
at the rates</hi> you did, I ſhould <hi>give
you</hi> the <hi>laſt word, as not intending to
confute you,</hi> &amp;c. I found my ſelf in a ſtreight
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:63037:18"/>
when I read your ſecond—about my duty:
Though you trampled admonition under
your feet, and turn again and all to rend
me, I ought not to take you for a Swine or
Dog, and give you up as wholly hopeleſs,
till there is no remedy: being under the
command, Lev. 19. 17. <hi>Thou ſhalt not hate
thy brother in thy heart, thou ſhalt in any
wiſe rebuke thy neighbour and not ſuffer ſin
upon him!</hi> And Charity forbiddeth me to
deſert all thoſe ſouls whom you endeavour
to ſeduce, by denying them neceſſary infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
and ſilently to ſuffer them to live in
all the ſins in which you would enſnare them.
And yet I have been chidden by ſo many for
anſwering your laſt Writing, as containing
ſuch palpable <hi>ſcurrility, impertinency</hi> and <hi>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,</hi>
that I am afraid of waſting my time,
which I might better employ; and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
a leſſer matter before a greater: And I
expect you ſhould charge me as a breaker of
my promiſe: But of that you have your
ſelf diſcharged me, it being conditional <hi>[If
you write at the rates you did,</hi> &amp;c.] and but
the expreſſion of my <hi>[Intentions]</hi> which I
may well alter, when your alteration calleth
for it: For though you neither expreſs <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi>
nor <hi>Amend</hi> the faults, of which I
did admoniſh you, yet you here attempt
ſuch a Plea for ſeparation, as you did not in
your former writing, where you ſeemed to
expect that your bare aſſertions ſhould be
believed; but now you pretend to more ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentation:
which therefore I ſhall take
into conſideration.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:63037:18"/>
But ſtill I perceive the unavoidable ſtreights
into which you caſt me in the performance:
If I mention your <hi>Error</hi> and <hi>Sin,</hi> you will
think that I make you odious, and trample
upon your honour, and cauſe your perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and ſtrengthen your adverſaries: And
if I ſilence them all, I ſhall leave you under
ſin, which is worſe than perſecution, and I
ſhall neglect the ſouls of others, and I ſhall
betray the honour of Religion, as if its fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
were but ſuch as you, and as if our
Cauſe were guilty of all the <hi>Error and ſin</hi>
which you maintain. And if you are to be
believed if I do not <hi>reprove you,</hi> I ſhall <hi>but
little differ from you:</hi> For you ſay of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
caſe, pag. 11, 12. <hi>[There being but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
difference in the ſight of God,</hi> &amp;c.] And
what ſhould I do with you, when you caſt
me into ſuch a ſtreight?</p>
               <p>Why this I take to be my duty 1. Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
firſt to conſider of all the evil which
you charge upon my ſelf, that I may not be
guilty of the ſin of the times, which I am
conſtrained to lament in others, that is, <hi>An
obſtinate Enmity to Repentance;</hi> nor yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfully
neglect any help that God ſhall
any way vouchſafe me, for the diſcovery of
my ſin. 2. And then ſo to acquaint you
with your <hi>errors</hi> and <hi>miſcarriages,</hi> as may
tend, 1. To your repentance; 2. And to
other mens preſervation; 3. And to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
Religion, and the faithful afflicted Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of Chriſt, againſt the unjuſt accuſation
of thoſe, who would make the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:63037:19"/>
that your Caſe is theirs, and that their
principles and practices are ſuch as yours.
4. And in all to preſerve that juſt eſteem and
love which I owe you, as one that I think
yet upright in the main. I love your <hi>zeal</hi>
for that which you take to be the Truth:
I greatly love your <hi>Fortitude</hi> of mind, and
<hi>undaumedneſs</hi> under ſufferings, as ſuch; and
being ſo much above the fear of man: And
I think it a thouſand pitties that you have
not 1. A better Cauſe, 2. A humbler mind,
and better acquaintance with your ſelf, 3. A
ſounder and clearer judgement; 4. More
univerſal Charity; 5. More ſenſe of the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs

more Sobriety and Caution, and leſs teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Conſcience to avoid <hi>untruths;</hi> 7. And more
impartiality, to ſee that evil in your ſelf, and
thoſe of your opinion, which you can ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate
in thoſe by whom you ſuffer; and
8. Laſtly, That you have not leſs <hi>Enmity to
Repentance,</hi> and that you take an invitation
to <hi>Repentance</hi> to be a malicious reproach,
and will not underſtand why God recordeth
his ſervants ſins, nor will conſider how
much better it is that the reproach of ſin, do
fall upon us, than upon our Religion, or the
Church of God; and that we our ſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
our ſins, than that our adverſaries up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid
us with Impenitent juſtifying them.
And while you are ſo notoriouſly wanting
in all theſe things, the greater noiſe your
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:63037:19"/>
ſufferings make, the more injurious you will
be to the Truth, and to your brethren, and
the greater hardning to others: And Satan
will not only uſe you to the corrupting of
well-meaning peoples minds, and to the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Concord,</hi>
but alſo to the reproach of <hi>ſuffering it ſelf:</hi>
And while you cry out of perſecution, you
will prove a notable cauſe of all our defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
and afflictions, and a great temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
to the actors to juſtifie what they do.</p>
               <p>And now, on theſe terms, I ſhall conſider
of your words, and help you better to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand

I daily beg of God, that the decays of my
natural ſpirits and fervour by frigid age and
weakneſs, may not abate the true fervour of
my ſoul; much leſs any abatement of the
eſtimation of holy <hi>Truth,</hi> the ſearch of
which hath been the unwearied buſineſs, the
(almoſt) uninterrupted pleaſure of my life.
And ſpecially that my love to God, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and Holineſs may not decay, which
alas, was wofully cold, and little at the beſt.
But I confeſs to you, that I am for a <hi>middle
way</hi> between <hi>fury</hi> and <hi>ſtupidity, pride</hi> and
<hi>baſeneſs, ſuperſtition</hi> and <hi>profaneſs,</hi> the love

pernicious extreams.: And you remember
me of the folly of my youthful ignorance,
in which I preſently ſuſpected any man of
tepidity and carnal indifferency, who wrote
for reconciliation of Contenders, and for a
middle Conciliatory way, (ſuch as about
Arminianiſm, <hi>Pet. Molinaeus, Vſher, Voſſius,
Davenant, Hall, Preſton, Fenner, Crocius,

they who do not ſo ſin, as that <hi>[the place

<hi>Oliver Cromwells</hi> firſt Troop did under their

where I had the ſociety of very many

and was out of the heats of War: And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he expoſtulated with me himſelf for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing
his deſires: But the very firſt hour
that I went to his Army, which was after
<hi>Naſeby</hi> fight, he having notice of my words
and intentions, from a friend of his of the
<hi>Coventry</hi> Committee, I was entertained by
the jeers of his moſt intimate friends, as
<hi>one that came forſooth to Reclaim the Army,
and ſave the Kingdom, &amp;c.</hi> And in a year
and halfs time while I ſtayed among them,
he would never once ſpeak to me; nor was
I ever at his Quarters, but kept at a diſtance
as one of their adverſaries, and thoſe that
I had intereſt in were diſcountenanced for
my ſake. And had not a ſudden bleeding
brought me very near to death, and ſeparated
me from the Army, about the very day that
they had their firſt open Conſultation, for
the following Treaſonable Changes which
they made, I had hazarded my life upon
their diſpleaſure, in the contradicting them,
and drawing off as many from them as I
could, at the time when many did deſert

of the Miniſters at <hi>Coventry,</hi> I ſtayed with
them for that very end, when I had peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
opportunity to have returned to my

declare to thoſe that I converſt with, that I
took him and his Army to be guilty of moſt
perfidious Treaſon and Rebeilion, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
for an unqueſtionable Uſurper. And I
never ſpake one word to the contrary. And
being once before his death (being at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>)
invited to ſpeak with him, I expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
with him, by what Right our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was changed, and how he could prove
that all the people of <hi>England</hi> had loſt their

changes</hi> [The fabrication of an Inſtrument of

[Next this we had the Minor part of the

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:63037:30"/>
according to the Humble Petition and
Advice, (and ſworn to both): And now we
are wheeled about again.]</p>
               <p>Reader, did this man read all this, and
all the reſt that in that Book, eſpecially the
Preface and Concluſion, I then wrote (in
the bitterneſs of my ſoul) againſt the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my?
and did <hi>he believe himſelf, or could he
poſſibly believe himſelf, that I approved of the
ſetting up of</hi> Cromwell <hi>to be Protector?</hi> If he
do really believe himſelf, How unfit a man
is this (who underſtands not humane lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage)
to be the great refiner of the Church,
and to pretend to be wiſer than the Old
Non-conformiſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—If he <hi>do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi>
himſelf, how unfit is he to ſeparate
from us for our ſinfulneſs, or to be believed
by the people whom he ſeduceth.</p>
               <p>2. The words which he citeth, are only
in a Parentheſis, concerning which take this
true information. 1. Men uſed to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
between a <hi>Tyrant quoad jus,</hi> and a <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
quoad exercitium:</hi> And I ordinarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
<hi>Cromwell</hi> a Tyrant <hi>quoad jus,</hi> that is,
an Uſurper. 2. I never thought it laudable
to belye any man whomſoever, nor to make
his actions worſe than they are. I did not
diſlike any good, becauſe <hi>Cromwell</hi> did it:
I will not renounce God, or Chriſt, or
Piety, becauſe that <hi>Cromwell</hi> profeſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
owned them. All that was good in him,
was not made <hi>bad</hi> (as to the nature of the
thing) becauſe he did it. I never cenſured
<hi>Sulpitius Severus, Beda,</hi> or any other Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:63037:31"/>
for extolling the Chriſtian Piety of
<hi>Maximus,</hi> while they call him a Tyrant, as
to Title. I will not fall out with God, or
Scripture, or Honeſty, becauſe that <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi>
did ſpeak well of them all. 3. Note,
that I ſpake only of his <hi>Exerciſe</hi> of <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and not of his <hi>Right,</hi> which I ſtill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
to be Null.—4. And I inſtanced what
his <hi>Prudence was,</hi> (before) <hi>[His prudent
ſhunning of Engagements,]</hi> that he put not
upon us any Oaths or Promiſes of <hi>Allegiance</hi>
to himſelf; For he knew that we would
refuſe them, and thereby diſturb his peace.
It is known unqueſtionably that <hi>Cromwell</hi> did
many things that were (in their nature)
very laudable. 5. And I mentioned this
(not as a praiſe of him, but) as a Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Rebellious Army, who thought
they might take down all Government, to
ſet up themſelves, whom they could eaſilier
believe to be good and godly, than any
others: And whereas they pretended, that
it was for <hi>ungodlineſs,</hi> that they pulled down
their Superiours, I ſhewed them, that if they
could not believe that the King was godly,
nor the Parliament godly, nor the Minor
part of the Parliament (called the <hi>Rump</hi>)
godly, nor their Little Mock-Parliament
godly, yet they ſhould not have ſo accuſed
<hi>Cromwell,</hi> whom they cryed up, and ſet him
up themſelves, and magnified ſo highly as
they did. 6. And I meant this Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of ſome of his actions, as compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
only, and better than theirs that pulled
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:63037:31"/>
down that which themſelves ſet up. 7. And
yet, I thank you for calling me to review
thoſe words, and do hereby declare, that I
do take them to be unmeet (as ſpoken to
the Army that then had greatly provoked
me to grief) and that I unfeignedly <hi>Repent
of them;</hi> that you may ſee I love not Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence
in my ſelf, any more than in you:
And I wiſh that they had not been written,
being ſo lyable to ill effects; and it being
unmeet too much to praiſe even the good
that a Uſurper doth, leſt it take off the <hi>odium</hi>
of his Uſurpation.</p>

never denyed any thing that was good in

warned our Lawful Governours, that they
tempt not the people to diſlike them, by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing
any good which he did. 2. The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
falſhood, that I ſpeak worſe of him
now, than I did heretofore. Whereas the
truth is, that I ſpake in the time of his own
Uſurpation I am confident twenty times
againſt him, for once that I have ſpoken
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:63037:32"/>
ſince his death: Not that I changed my
opinion of him; but that it is ſo croſs to
humane nature, to inſult over even malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
in their ſufferings, eſpecially when we
ſuffer with them (though by them) and
when their adverſaries need no inſtigation,
that I have not been able to judge it my
duty, to ſpeak of that very evil, which I
and others ſuffer by: But have been hardly
put to it theſe eleven years, between the
thoughts of open diſowning thoſe ſins of
<hi>ſelf-exalting Vſurpers</hi> that have confounded
us, and a lothneſs to encreaſe the ſufferings
of thoſe that are underfoot. And this
laſt prevailing, I have greatly by it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed
my Superiours: And yet leſt I
ſhould harden men in impenitency, having
gently mentioned theſe Crimes, it diſpleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

how ſtrangely doth this man deſpiſe his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
while he again maketh it ſuch a thing

When in my firſt Book I told him, <hi>p.</hi> 374.

                  <hi>R. B.</hi> I gave a full anſwer to this, which
no reply is given to: As if you were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to ſay what your liſt, and hear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that is ſaid againſt it. As I told you
that I never ſaw him, nor ever had to do
with him, ſave that when I ſaw him take
part againſt the turbulent ſort of men, I
took it to be ſeaſonable by that Dedication
to perſwade him to do good and not hurt.
So I told you, that your words of <hi>[Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
a flattering Book to him]</hi> in common
ſenſe do diſtinguiſh between the <hi>Book</hi> and the
<hi>Dedication:</hi> Whether the <hi>Dedication</hi> were

                  <hi>flattery,</hi> I left to the Reader of it to judge,

affirmed <hi>[that there is not one ſyllable of
his Son in all the Books, but only in the Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.]</hi>
Yet this man goeth on, and falſly
chargeth me to deny that which I denyed
not, and reciteth my words in the Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to prove that the <hi>Book</hi> as diſtinct from
the Dedication was flattery.</p>

                  <hi>R. B.</hi> 1. Your <hi>[I mean, unleſs you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent]</hi>

When you ſay one thing, you think to ſolve

did you believe your ſelf that the Biſhop of
<hi>Worceſters</hi> words ſo many years ago, are a
proof that <hi>I repent not</hi> now? 4. And are
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:63037:33"/>
you yet inſenſible of your own partiality;
that then you blamed that in the Biſhop
which now you can freely do your ſelf?
Let your followers mark what Spirit you
are of, if you are reſolved not to know your
ſelf? Do you not ſee now that the man who
took it for ſo great a crime in the Biſhop,
can ſpeak himſelf, 1. Againſt the ſame man,
2. With the ſame accuſation, 3. In the ſame
manner. And is the ſame thing bad in the
Biſhop, and good in you? The matter is, it
ſeemeth now to be your concernment to
ſpeak it: Its like you would then have ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated

it is no fault in you? O what a blinding

hath any man to doubt, but if it were in
your power, you would ſilence me as much
as any Biſhop would? And will you not
yet ſee that which you are ſo angry with
me for telling you; viz. <hi>How much of the
very ſame Spirit is in Church-dividers, with
that which they moſt condemn in others:</hi> Why
then do you not ſeparate from your ſelves?</p>
               <p>5. But, though you may think its like
that you have me here in your ſnares, I ſhall
make this benefit of it, that you may ſee I
am not ſo great an enemy to <hi>Repenting,</hi> as
you declare your ſelf to be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I do hereby freely profeſs, that I Repent</hi>
1. Of all that ever I thought, ſaid, wrote, or
did ſince I was born, againſt the Peace of
Church or State; Againſt the King, his Perſon,
or Authority, as Supream in himſelf, or as De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivative

in any of his Officers, Magiſtrates,
or any Commiſſioned by him.</p>
               <p>2. That I Repent that I no more diſcouraged
the Spirit of pieviſh quarrelling with Superiours
and Church-orders, and (though I ever diſliked
and oppoſed it, yet) that I ſometimes did too
much encourage ſuch, as were of this temper,
by ſpeaking too ſharply againſt thoſe things
which I thought to be Church-corruptions; and
was too loth to diſpleaſe the contentious, for
fear of being uncapable of doing them good
(knowing the prophane to be much worſe than
they) and meeting with too few Religious
perſons, that were not too much pleaſed with
ſuch invectives.</p>
               <p>3. And I do Repent that I had not more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially
and diligently conſulted with the beſt
Lawyers that were againſt the Parliaments
Cauſe (For I knew of no Controverſie in Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
about it, but in Politicks and Law;) and
that I did not uſe all poſſible means of full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with the Caſe. And that for a little
while the Authority of ſuch Writers as
Mr. <hi>Rich. Hooker lib. 1. Eccleſ. Polit.</hi> and
Biſhop <hi>Bilſon,</hi> and other Epiſcopal Divines did
too much ſway my judgement toward the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Popular Power; And ſeeing the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
Epiſcopal, and Eraſtian, and not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
when the Wars began of two Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
among them all, nor among all their Lord
Lieutenants, Generalls, Major Generalls, or
Colonells, till long after, I was the eaſilyer
drawn to think that <hi>Hookers</hi> Political Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
had been commonly received by all; which
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:63037:34"/>
I diſcerned ſoon after upon ſtricter enquiry, to be
unſound, and have my ſelf written a Confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them, ready for the Preſs many years
ago.</p>
               <p>4. And all the reſt of my ſin in this buſineſs,
which I know not of particularly, I do Impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly
and Generally Repent of; and daily beg
of God (as I have done theſe twenty four
years and more) to give me a particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
of them, and not to ſuffer me to live or
dye in any impenitence, but ſo far to acquaint
me with all my great and publick ſins, that I
may openly confeſs them, and give others warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to avoid the like. <hi>This is the Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,

               <p>If you quarrel with it as not inſtancing

the Revocation of the Book which you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe,
I thought it beſt to <hi>Revoke the whole,</hi>
(though not as <hi>Retracting</hi> all the doctrine
of it,) becauſe if I had named the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
paſſages, ſome would have ſaid I had
mentioned too few, and ſome too many, and
few would have been ſatisfied; ſo is it in
the preſent Caſe.</p>
               <p>6. As to your Defence of me heretofore,
1. You know I never deſired it of you, nor
gave you thanks for it. For though you
took my part, you underſtood not my
Cauſe, and therefore in the main deſerted it.
2. I am not at all ambitious of ſuch an
Advocate, 1. Whoſe Defence was then judged
by all that I heard ſpeak of it, to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:63037:35"/>
only for <hi>boldneſs,</hi> and a handſome
<hi>Epiſtolary Style,</hi> having little of Judgement
or argumentative ſtrength: 2. Whoſe errors
and faults will diſgrace the Cauſe which he
defendeth: 3. Who can blow hot and cold,
and when his paſſion and erroneous intereſt
requireth it, can change hands, and take
up his adverſaries work, and do the ſame
thing in the main, which he accuſed.

                  <hi>R. B.</hi> I ſee but five expreſs falſhoods in

is, that it is <hi>Chriſts Temporal Reign,</hi> which I
call the <hi>fifth Monarchy way;</hi> when as I have
no ſuch words, nor meaning, but do my

1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 17. 2. that he hath power <hi>given him
over all fleſh; and that to this end he dyed,
roſe and revived, that he might be Lord of the
dead and living:</hi> Rom. 14. 9. and that he is
<hi>King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.</hi> But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he will Reign <hi>a thouſand years in corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
viſible preſence on earth,</hi> I am not wiſe
enough to know: But I am afraid of thoſe
opinions which draw down mens minds
from looking for a treaſure and reward in
Heaven, and tempt them to expect great
things on Earth. But in this Age cuſtome
hath taught men to diſtinguiſh between
thoſe called <hi>Fifth Monarchy men,</hi> and <hi>meer
Millenaries.</hi> And by the former name, I
mean ſuch as they that aſſumed that name
have been, whom I will not deſcribe, leſt I
ſeem to imitate you, or offend you more than
needs.</p>
               <p>2. The ſecond falſhood is, that I mention
the Doctrine of Chriſts Temporal Reign
with <hi>ſcorn</hi> and <hi>deriſion;</hi> when I only menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
the <hi>way by which</hi> many of my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
<hi>came to hold it,</hi> and the <hi>argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
which they uſed to defend it, with
<hi>pitty</hi> and <hi>diſſent,</hi> but not with <hi>ſcorn</hi> or deriſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
much leſs that doctrine which he
nameth.</p>
               <p>3. The third <hi>falſhood</hi> is, that <hi>I endeavour
to expoſe all that I think favour that opinion;</hi>
when as ſome of my moſt intimate and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
friends favour the <hi>Millenary</hi> Opinion:
and I know how commonly it was owned
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:63037:36"/>
by many of the Ancients, and who doth not
honour the name of Mr. <hi>Joſ. Mead,</hi> Dr. <hi>Twiſſe,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Baily,</hi> Mr. <hi>Porter, &amp;c.</hi> that did more
than favour it? And when did I ever endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to expoſe ſuch men? (its like you
mean, unto <hi>ſcorn,</hi> or ſome <hi>evil.</hi>)</p>
               <p>4. The fourth and notorious falſhood is,
that <hi>I dare not look any truth in the face,
that brings preſent danger with it:</hi> when him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
ſaith, that I am <hi>in the ſame condemnation
with them;</hi> which hath more truth in it in
a full ſenſe, than I will here open, leſt I ſeem
to diſhnour my Governours. And though
I confeſs that my Impriſonment was not ſo
long and ſharp as his, yet he can ſcarce be
ſo ignorant as to imagine, that he <hi>loſeth by
his judgement,</hi> ſo much as I do by mine,
<hi>quoad lucrum ceſſans, &amp; damnum emergens.</hi>
But his own Pen doth publiſh him temerari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
falſe: while he publiſheth me to have
been <hi>formerly as earneſt and open an aſſerter
as any of this Opinion;</hi> and doth not cite
one ſyllable whereby I ever did revoke it:
And I here as openly declare to him and all
the world, that I am ſtill of the ſame mind
that I was in that point, and I am ſtill rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to expreſs my mind in the ſame words
of mine which he reciteth. And while I
openly own the ſame words which he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counteth
ſo dangerous, and pretendeth that
they aſſert as much as any; judge whether
he be a man to be believed, that ſaith I dare
not look that truth in the face, which I
openly own, or any other that brings preſent
danger.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:63037:36"/>
5. The next notorious falſhood is, that
<hi>formerly I was as earneſt an aſſerter of it as
any;</hi> that is, of the <hi>Fifth Monarchy way. As
any?</hi> Have I written for the Millenary Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
as <hi>earneſtly</hi> and <hi>openly</hi> as Mr. <hi>Mead</hi> hath
done? Have I—I will paſs over late
practices. Nay did I ever write or ſpeak
one word for it? But you ſhall preſently ſee
how he confuteth himſelf. But before I
leave this, I muſt name <hi>two or three implyed
falſhoods</hi> in theſe words, beſides the <hi>five ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. The one is,<note place="margin">21ſt Falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed.</note> that <hi>the Doctrine of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Reign of Chriſt, brings preſent danger:</hi>
when as all Chriſtians that I know of, do
believe or hold his Temporal Reign: And as
for his <hi>Perſonai Corporal Viſible Reign,</hi> I never
heard of any Law againſt any that held it,
nor any danger that any man incurred, much
leſs any ſuffering for holding it. I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded,
if Chriſt came <hi>perſonally</hi> and <hi>viſibly</hi>
to demand it, the King himſelf would yield
up his Crown to him. But I muſt confeſs
to you, that if any man will call himſelf a
believer of the <hi>Fifth M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>narchy,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
will either deny the Authority of Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
that are bad, (even if they were Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels
or Perſecutors) or that they judge bad,
or will deny to ſwear Allegiance to the
King, or will maintain that good men may
ſeize upon the Government becauſe they are
good (or think themſelves ſo) and that
becauſe the Saints ſhall judge the world,
therefore they may depoſe bad Governours,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:63037:37"/>
and take their places, and ſet up themſelves
under pretence of ſetting up Chriſt; I deny

opinions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as knowing them to be no <hi>truths,</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>R. B.</hi> 1. You ſpake of <hi>danger</hi> before; you
now add <hi>Perſecution and Martyrdom,</hi> intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
that this is ſuch a perſecuted point;
which as far as ever I heard (who live in
the ſame Land, and have as hard thoughts
of <hi>perſecution</hi> as many others have) there is
not any thing true in your intimation.
Name the Law that is againſt the Opinion of
the <hi>deſirableneſs of a holy Government of all
the world?</hi> Name the perſon that ever ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for that Opinion? Though thoſe that
will reſiſt or pull down Governours, becauſe
they take them (juſtly or unjuſtly) to be
ungodly, may ſuffer for it. Again therefore
to imply danger of Martyrdom, for that
which no man (that ever I heard of) ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
for, and to feign the avoiding of that
danger, to be the Chief Cauſe of my recanting
or changing my mind or words, which I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
recanted or changed, is a monſtrous
courſe of fiction and temerity.</p>
               <p>2. Your talk of <hi>Recanting all that former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
I was convinced of]</hi> implyeth more teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and falſhood. Any man of humane
modeſty would have thought <hi>[All]</hi> too
bigg a word, when the inſtances produced
by him prove nothing. If you refer to
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:63037:39"/>
the <hi>Revocation</hi> of my <hi>Book,</hi> you ſhould have
opened your eyes, and ſeen that I profeſs
not to Recant all the doctrine of it, though
I <hi>revoke all the Book,</hi> and wiſh men to take
it as <hi>non-ſcriptum:</hi> And ſure <hi>that paſſage</hi> had
no <hi>peculiar</hi> recantation.</p>
               <p>3. But if Recantation be ſo eaſie to me,
remember that I pretend not to <hi>Infallibility,</hi>
nor am altogether unwilling to Repent. As
for Martyrdom, I take it to be every Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
duty, yea, neceſſary to ſalvation, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
for it; that is, to deny his life, and to
forſake all in true reſolution, for the ſake of
Chriſt, and hopes of Heaven: But how far
my heart is brought to a willingneſs of it,
though I am ſure you know not, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
venture to ſpeak what you know not:
yet I have no reaſon to boaſt, nor to be

               <p>But the Major is falſe, and therefore inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient

Tell your followers, 1. Is it falſe or true,
that ſufferings have their temptations as well
as Proſperity; and in particular to drive us
into uncharitableneſs and extreams from

as having ſuffered very much in

my infirmities, but I ſhall confeſs, that they
greatly aggravate my ſin, if your words be
true: For I have born the yoke from my
youth: ſince fourteen years of age I have
not been a year free from ſuffering, and ſince
twenty two but few dayes, and ſince 1646.
(which is about twenty five years, I have
had but few hours free from pain, (though
through Gods mercy, not intolerable.) I
have had ſufferings in Peace, and ſufferings
four years in War: The firſt year I preached
the Goſpel, my life was ſought by malice
for my Miniſterial work, and diſſent from
others: The next place I came to (where
I was after more bleſt, and ſpent my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours)
the firſt year I was hooted at in the
Streets, but for preaching the <hi>Original ſin</hi>
and <hi>miſery</hi> of mankind (which this man
feigneth me to extenuate, if not deny.) The
next year my life was ſought by an armed
Tumult, and ſtrangely preſerved, while
others were knockt down in the Streets, but
for looking after my ſafety. The ſame year
my life was ſought more publickly, and I
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:63037:41"/>
was forced into a Garriſon from my habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
through the fury that ſtill ſought my
life. And ſince then, O what wholſome and
conſtant ſufferings have been meaſured out
unto me, almoſt continually night and day.
I will ſay no more, but <hi>that</hi> above all the
external diſpoſals of my moſt wiſe and

daily thank him for my ſufferings. But

that I have ſinned ſo much under ſufferings,
and been ſo unfruitful after ſufferings, that I
have little cauſe to boaſt of <hi>cleanſing,</hi> and leſs
<hi>experience of comfort,</hi> than otherwiſe I might
have had. But yet I have ſo much experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

that you <hi>ſpeak it to my ſhame,</hi> is but to ſhew
that you could hardly ſpeak with any cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
many ſentences together: For your <hi>fear</hi>

diſcovered by your writings is ſo apparent, that
it cannot but be known and read of all men:
to go no further for inſtances than your laſt
Books, what needed you have told the world in

in a very populous Church, purpoſely
that it might be the further known. Is not
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:63037:45"/>
this like the Hypocrites to blow a Trumpet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and to do your actions that they may be
ſeen of men? What other end could you have
in doing that ſo publickly then, or in declaring
it now, but a vain glorious hope, that doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

your example, as their Pole-ſtar, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
direct their courſe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>R. B.</hi> 1. As to the Pride of my heart,<note place="margin">Of Pride.</note> I
ſhall firſt ſay this in general; that I am paſt
doubt I have too much of it: As no man
is wholly cured of that odious vice, ſo I am
one that have no cauſe to ſay that I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.
But theſe things I can confidently ſay,
1. That ſo far as I am proud, I ſin as much
againſt my <hi>own judgement,</hi> I imagine, as
moſt men alive do; there being ſew that
ever I was acquainted with, that have ſaid
and written more againſt it than I have
done: I have had theſe thirty years and
more, more odious conceptions of that ſin,
and a deeper ſenſe of its commonneſs and
prevalency in the world, and the wofull
ruines which it makes in the Church and
State and ſouls; and how frequently it
ſheweth it ſelf even in men of great piety
and worth, than of almoſt any other ſin.
I have had ſo many thouſand thoughts and
words againſt it, as make me much more
culpable, if I be proud. 2. And I ſhall ſin
as much againſt my <hi>Conſcience</hi> in being proud
as moſt men in the world. As my Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is ſo much againſt the ſin, ſo my <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi>
commandeth me a very <hi>Low</hi> and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:63037:46"/>
                  <hi>Conſtant</hi> ſelf-abaſement: It telleth me, that
whether I look to a corruptible painfull
fleſh, or to an Ignorant underſtanding, or to
a ſinful will, or to a ſinful and unprofitable
life, I have ſo little to be proud of, as will
render my pride exceeding odious. 3. I do
evidently ſee the odiouſneſs of this ſin in
others: Were it not for ſeeming to retort
your charge, I ſhould ſay, that though I
cannot as you do conclude of the heart, yet
the uſual Enſigns of <hi>Pride</hi> (with <hi>Temerity</hi>
and <hi>Injudiciouſneſs, Boldneſs</hi> and <hi>Blindneſs</hi>)
do appear to me ſo monſtrous in your Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
above the ſize that ordinary ſinners
ever fall to, as maketh me the more appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend,
how dreadful it is to give way to
pride in the beginnings; And methinks I
ſee as written on the front of your Writings,
<hi>Be not high-minded, but fear.</hi> Therefore I
am ſtill the more culpable, if I abound with
that which is ſo terrible a warning to me,
in your ſelf, and other ſuch as you. 4. And
as I every day watch and pray againſt it
(and if ever I knew any thing of my ſelf in
the world, I am certain that I live in an habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate
and ordinary apprehenſion of my baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and unworthineſs, and of the utter va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of humane applauſe) ſo I find my ſelf
partly glad that you tell me of my Pride,
that (whatever you mean) I may have one
more check to keep it under; and if it be
a meſſenger of Satan to buffet me, I hope it
will not be in vain. 5. And I can aſſure
you, that theſe Writings which ſo exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:63037:46"/>
you, had never come from me, if I
had not firſt ſo far conquered the eſteem
of man, and love of reputation, as to be
willing to caſt my ſelf upon reproach, and
to be much indifferent as to the opinion of
man? For I was not ſo ignorant as not to
foreſee that ſuch as you would take the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
and reproof of their errors for a
heinous injury, and be angry at him that
called them to repent, and would furiouſly
ſcatter the fetide excrements of their gall,
in revilings of ſuch as contradict them.
Methinks then you ſhould ſee, that I laid by
ſome Pride, when I cared ſo little for your
good word, and expoſed my ſelf ſo readily
to your Calumnies.</p>
               <p>2. And I muſt tell you that though you
do as much to cure my pride, as almoſt any
mortal man that ever I had to do with, by
the way of open demonſtration of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
of it by your ſelf (as the ſight of a
Leproſie would cure one that were in love
with it;) yet you are too blame for <hi>Tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
me ſo much to pride as you do on the
other ſide, while you decry it: For what is
it elſe but an inviting and tempting a man
to be proud, to tell the world, that you
have nothing to charge him with to prove
it, but ſuch ſilly Calumnies as theſe of
yours?</p>
               <p>3. And yet I will ſay, that I ſee now that
a mans enemies may be more uſeful to him
than his friends: For I can hear that of my
Pride from you, which never friend by
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:63037:47"/>
Word or Letter to my remembrance told
me in my life. The more too blame they,
if you be not miſtaken.</p>
               <p>2. But next let us ſee your evidence or
proof:<note place="margin">The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of my publick Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating.</note> Your firſt is, <hi>[What need I have
told the world, &amp;c.]</hi> would you have an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to your queſtion or not? If not, why
do you ask it? If you would, why did you
not take an anſwer when I gave it you;
nor ſo much as mention it, as if you read
it not, when you call for another? Is it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that you remembred, that many that
read your Papers, will never read mine, and
ſo will not know what I have ſaid, nor how
deceivingly you uſe them? It may be ſo:
But will that do your work, and hold at
laſt? If I repeat my anſwer, I ſhall offend
my Readers, for writing the ſame thing
twice, becauſe you take no notice of the
firſt. But this much I will return you now:
1. My avoiding <hi>publick communion</hi> for fear of
bringing more ſuffering on thoſe that ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled
it, (and that ſo many years together,)
was a ſcandal and temptation to others, and
tended to make them think, that I held it
to be unlawful; as <hi>Peters</hi> Separation was a
ſcandal to <hi>Barnabas</hi> and others: And do
you think every man that avoideth ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing,
is therefore proud: Are not humble
men bound to avoid ſcandal as well as
others? If a man by many years forbearing
all publick Prayer or Sacrament, ſhould
tempt others to think that he is againſt
them, or accounts them needleſs, how
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:63037:47"/>
ſhould he cure that ſcandal, but by doing
that openly, and open pleading for it, which
he is ſuppoſed to be againſt? Doth <hi>Paul</hi>
make ſcandal to be the deſtroying of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
ſoul, and a thing to be avoided on ſuch
hard terms as he mentioneth, and do you
think that the open avoiding it, is to be
charged with Pride? How directly do you
ſet your ſelf againſt the way of the Spirit of
God?</p>
               <p>2. I had for the ſame reaſon become a
ſcandal alſo to our Governours, and to many
ſober Conformable men, who were tempted
by my omiſſion, to think the Non-conformiſts
to be pieviſh Dividers, who follow Parties
and Paſſion, more than their own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences?
And would any thing cure this ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
alſo, that had not been notified? Or is
the ſcandal of ſo many ſuch perſons no evil
to be avoided; nor their miſ-judging of the
Non-conformiſts to be cured by ſuch as did
occaſion it?</p>
               <p>3. Is not every Miniſter of Chriſt a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
perſon? Should they not be the Lights
of the world, that cannot and ſhould not
be hid? Is every man Proud, that is not
Mad? Whether my <hi>Actions be noted,</hi> is a
matter of <hi>fact?</hi> The queſtion is not, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I be ſo regardable, as to be <hi>worthy</hi>
notice? but whether <hi>de facto</hi> any do note
what I do? And do you doubt of it? Why
then do you write two invectives to cure
their eſteem of me? Do you not perceive
here how your <hi>work</hi> contradicts your ſelf?
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:63037:48"/>
And muſt I needs as my duty, be ſo mad,
as not to know that any obſerve me, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
what I do, for fear of being proud?
You might as well make it a duty to go
naked in the Streets, leſt I be proud if I
think that any one will obſerve me. 4. And
are not Miniſters bound to teach the people
by <hi>Example,</hi> as well as by Doctrine? You
dare not deny it. And is that example,
which is <hi>unknown?</hi> Will you teach men to
ſay againſt Gods command, I muſt not be ſo
Proud as to think that my <hi>example</hi> will be
obſerved or regarded? God ſaith, 1 Tim.
4. 12. <hi>Be thou an example of the believers in
word, in converſation, in charity, in Spirit, in
faith, in purity:</hi> Muſt none that think mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of themſelves obey this? O but, you will
reply, <hi>Is not this like Hypocrites, to do your
actions to be ſeen of men?</hi> Chriſt will have
us all to <hi>let our light ſo ſhine before men</hi> (not
with the Hypocrite to get their applauſe to
our ſelves, but for their own good and
Gods glory) <hi>that they may ſee our good
works, and glorifie our Father which is in
Heaven.</hi> O but ſaith Mr. <hi>Bagſhaw, What
other end can you have in doing this, but a
vain-glorious hope, that doubting Chriſtians
may look on your example as their Pole-ſtar,
&amp;c</hi> And indeed will ſuch a ſcorn of <hi>E. B.</hi>
diſoblige all Chriſts Miniſters from obeying
their Lord, and allow them to live in open
ſcandal, for fear of thinking it lawful to be
<hi>Exemplary?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. Do you think indeed that you are not
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:63037:48"/>
noted your ſelf? Do you neither in <hi>Life</hi> nor
in your <hi>ſufferings,</hi> intend to be publickly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary?
Do you not forbear the publick
<hi>Aſſemblies,</hi> the rather that your example may
move others? Thus ſtill a perverſe Spirit
condemneth it ſelf.</p>
               <p>6. If <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Example</hi> be the two
means commanded, by which Miniſters muſt
edifie the Church, is it not Pride as well to
expect that our <hi>words</hi> ſhould be heeded, as
our <hi>Examples?</hi> And could an Atheiſt deal
more impudently and prophanely, than to
tell all Miniſters, you are notoriouſly proud
in expecting that all the Congregation ſhould
take heed of what you ſay? Do you not
preach or talk to your own auditors, and
expect obſervation? What if another <hi>E. B.</hi>
were among them and ſhould ſay, How
proud are you to expect that we ſhould all
regard your words, as if you were our <hi>Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtar?</hi>
Theſe are not meet Leſſons for a ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
to teach the people.</p>

men of all judgements have written againſt

are accounted the <hi>Iſhmael</hi> of the age?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>R. B.</hi> Alas, poor man! Is this Conſcience
ſcrupulous of Communion with us Publicans
and ſinners? Here are no leſs than three
more viſible <hi>Vntruths</hi> thraſt together. 1. That
I ſay, <hi>[That men of all judgements have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:63037:49"/>
againſt me]</hi> when my words are theſe
<hi>[Whereas our differences in Doctrine, Worſhip
and Diſcipline have engaged men of ſeveral
minds in ſuch Writings againſt me.]</hi> Where
did I ſay, that men of the judgement of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
or <hi>Paul,</hi> of <hi>Auguſtine</hi> or <hi>Proſper,</hi> wrote
againſt me? Are thoſe Infidels, Quakers,
with the <hi>&amp;c. [All]?</hi> 2. That I <hi>glory</hi> that
I am accounted the <hi>Iſhmael</hi> of the age
(which is intimated in the queſtion) or
<hi>boaſt</hi> of mens contradiction? Which is ſo
notorious a falſhood, that I mention it only
as <hi>other mens contradiction of each other</hi> (who
blame me for <hi>contrary</hi> things) and as my <hi>own
trouble.</hi> I only told you, how impoſſible it
is for me to pleaſe all men, while men ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
ſo many contrary things of me: The
Anabaptiſts are quite diſpleaſed with me for
writing for Infants Baptiſm: The Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts
are angry, becauſe I will not ſubſcribe
that <hi>[It is certain by Gods Word, that Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
which are baptized, dying before they
commit actuall ſin, are undoubtedly ſaved]</hi>
without excepting thoſe that are <hi>wrongfully
baptized, Turks, Heathens, &amp;c.</hi> The Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians
are offended with me for oppoſing
their ſubverſion of the Goſpel under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of extolling free grace: And others
are angry that I come ſo near them, as to
the ceſſation of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law. And ſo it is
with all the reſt. How vain therefore is it
to turn a Man-pleaſer, when the task is as
impoſſible as unprofitable. But O, ſaith
<hi>E. B.</hi> what a <hi>ſtrange boaſt</hi> is this, to <hi>tell us that
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:63037:49"/>
men of all judgements have written againſt
you!</hi> That which I recite as my <hi>tryal</hi> and
<hi>trouble,</hi> he falſly tells the world, I <hi>boaſt</hi> of.</p>
               <p>3. The third known falſhood is (inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated)
that <hi>[I offend all and pleaſe none.]</hi>
As if he did believe that thoſe whom I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
(even with an <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) were <hi>[all]</hi> and
there were <hi>no</hi> others in the world?</p>
               <p>2. But beſides theſe falſhoods, he again
condemneth himſelf for his accuſation. For
1. If it be a matter of <hi>Pride</hi> to declare that I
am <hi>written againſt,</hi> why will this man <hi>write
himſelf againſt me,</hi> and tempt me to be <hi>more
proud,</hi> when he <hi>accuſeth</hi> me of pride? Is not
his Writing publiſhed by himſelf? Why then
will he publiſh that which himſelf ſuppoſeth
to be my <hi>glorying?</hi> and ſo advance my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation?
(which few adverſaries ever did
more effectually) 2. And if I <hi>offend all</hi> and
<hi>pleaſe none,</hi> what need he be at all this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to ſave men from being <hi>pleaſed</hi> by me?
But it is fatal or natural to men of his vice,
to have bad memories.</p>
               <p>The former untruth he again implyeth,
<hi>[You would be grieved for grieving them,
and not put it in among your triumphs, that

He that hath once ventured upon an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth,

               <p>As for the worthy Opponents whom he
nameth, 1. I can honour and love them as
much as he, without thinking them infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
And I can. differ from them without

diſaffection. 2. Which of them is it that the
man would have me grieve for grieving?
Doubtleſs thoſe that are in the points con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted
of his mind! So kind is he to
them or himſelf. It cannot be <hi>all,</hi> unleſs
he would have me, either ſay nothing of
the matter, or write contrary things to

not differ from moſt whom he nameth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,

not thus to grieve many more than

did ever read what I wrote againſt them,
either you believe your ſelf, or not. If you
do, how unfit are you to be believed of any
that know no better what is credible in a

ever read it? You will take this very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
its like for my pride, which you make
neceſſary to ſhew your temerity and deceit.
But if you do not believe your ſelf, how
much leſs ſhould others believe you?
7. Will no ſober Readers think that you ſet
your ſelf to do the Devils work, againſt the

<hi>ſilence</hi> us from <hi>writing</hi> by your contumely

Let your conſcience tell you, if I had
obeyed you from the firſt, and never writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
whether the Devil or moſt that have
made uſe of what I wrote, would have
thankt you more? 8. Did not the Primitive
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:63037:52"/>
Teachers, Apoſtles and others leave us their
Examples for <hi>Writing,</hi> as well as for <hi>Vocal</hi>
Teaching? And are they not two wayes of
predicating or publiſhing the ſame Goſpel?
And if ſo, would he ſerve God or the Devil,

ſo much, as the beſt men do? 9. And do
you not yet ſee how much you have of the

               <p>Your reaſon is, 1. Ridiculouſly fallacious,
2. And if all were granted, reacheth not the

               <p>1. It is Ridiculous, to argue, <hi>If a Dioceſane

Which is nothing to the queſtion. And
when you ſay that there is the ſame reaſon of

owned, 1. As a true Church of Chriſtians,
in its conſtitution. 2. And as a <hi>Pariſh
Church,</hi> limited by thoſe bounds, without
reſpect to the Dioceſane.</p>
               <p>2. And if it were to be diſowned as a

                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:63037:55"/>
I will ſhew you your Argument in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
caſe. Suppoſe that Uſurpers ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the form of Kingly Government, and ſet
up themſelves in another form, and ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
all the Independent Churches in the
Land, but ſet over them Civil officers in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
County of their own; and ſhould make a
Law, that none ſhall be a member of a
Church that liveth not within five miles of
the Meeting place. In this caſe, the <hi>Church</hi> is a
<hi>Church</hi> in its own Conſtitution; and that it
is confirmed to a Parochial circuit, or that it
is under uſurping Magiſtrates is an accidental
thing, which doth not nullifie it. And if you
argue <hi>[If the Vſurpers Commonwealth as
ſuch, be not to be communicated with or owned,
then the Church which is part of it is not to
be owned.</hi> Yes, as a <hi>Church,</hi> but not as a
part of the <hi>Common-wealth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If Independent Churches were under the
Turks Government, they may be parts of an
Infidel and perhaps uſurped Kingdom, and
yet be true Churches and to be owned.</p>
               <p>If Presbyterian Claſſical Churches be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
ſinful, and the Law ſaid that all the
Independent or particular Churches ſhall be
under the ſeveral Claſſes, and be part of thoſe
Churches, the Churches will be true Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
nevertheleſs. For, 1. Perhaps moſt of
them conſent not to the Laws determination,
but only forbear an open contradiction.
2. And in others of them the <hi>people</hi> may not
conſent though the <hi>Paſtor</hi> do. 3. And if
they <hi>do conſent,</hi> and it be their <hi>ſin,</hi> it will
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:63037:56"/>
not nullifie the particular Church; being but
an unwarrantable Accident.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Vniverſities</hi> were as unlawful as many
Separatiſts judge them, yet Dr. <hi>Goodwins</hi>
Church, <hi>e. g.</hi> in <hi>Oxford</hi> might have been
part of the Univerſity, and yet a true Church,
and to be diſowned as part of the Univerſity,
and yet not as a Church.</p>
               <p>If you were a member of an unlawful
Society, Army, Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> You may be
diſowned as a member of that Society,
and yet not as a Chriſtian, or as a Man.</p>
               <p>Now would not the Boyes laugh at you if
you ſhould reaſon thus: An uſurped Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh
Kingdom or Common-wealth, as
ſuch is unlawful, and not to be communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with; A Claſſical Church as ſuch is not
to be communicated with; An Univerſity as
ſuch is not to be communicated with:
Therefore ſuch or ſuch a particular Church
as ſuch is not to be communicated with,
which is a part of that Kingdom, that Claſſis,
that Univerſity! <hi>E. B.</hi> a Chriſtian is a member
of a Society which is not to be owned:
<hi>Ergo E. B.</hi> a Chriſtian as ſuch is not to be
owned. What more apparent than that the
conſequent ſhould be but this? <hi>Therefore ſuch
a Church ſhould not be owned, as it is a Part
of ſuch a Kingdom, Claſſis, Vniverſity,</hi> &amp;c.
which is all accidental to the Church.</p>
               <p>So that here is a double Equivocation,
and more than four terms: 1. <hi>[As ſuch]</hi>
ſpeaketh (as I ſaid) one eſſence in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent,
and another in the Conſequent.
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:63037:56"/>
2. The word <hi>[Communicating]</hi> ſpeaketh ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
things in the Antecedent and in the
Conſequent. For to <hi>Communicate</hi> with a
Dioceſane Church, is not to <hi>Aſſemble</hi> with it
in publick Worſhip: For a Dioceſs (in our
ſenſe) cannot ſo aſſemble: but it is to
own the Dioceſane Relation, and Prelats.
But to Communicate with a particular
Church in a Pariſh, is to have perſonal
Communion in the Worſhip of the Aſſembly.
So that this is your Argument if put in plain
words: <hi>[If it be unlawful to Communicate
with a Dioceſane Church as ſuch, by owning the
Dioceſanes and the relation to them, then it is
unlawful to communicate with a true parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Church in a Pariſh, (or bounded Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chially)
in the Aſſembly Worſhip as it is ſuch a
particular Church, which is part of that Dioceſane
Church: But,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, It may be
unlawful to communicate with it <hi>as</hi> a <hi>Part,</hi>
and that by <hi>Dioceſane Communion;</hi> but not <hi>as a
true Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> by <hi>aſſembly communion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Or thus</hi> [It is unlawful, <hi>e. g.</hi> to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with the Army of <hi>Maximus, Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel,</hi>
&amp;c. as ſuch: But many Chriſtians are
parts of the Army of <hi>Maximus, Cromwel,</hi> &amp;c.
Therefore it is unlawful to have communion
with thoſe Chriſtians: Becauſe there is the
ſame reaſon of the parts as of the whole.
Anſ. 1. <hi>Chriſtians are not parts of the Army
as Chriſtians, but as thoſe Souldiers. 2. It is
unlawful to have Military Communion with
them as parts of that Army; but not to have
Chriſtian Communion with them as Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>

of the Pariſh-Miniſters, but muſt even upon
that account alſo be ſeparated from; ſince either
by open conſent, or elſe by an Vndoing and
Pernicious ſilence they have all made themſelves
guilty of that grievous ſin: There being but
little difference in the ſight of God, between the
perſecuting Brethren our ſelves, and (by not
ſharply reproving it) ſeeming to approve of it
in others.</p>

                  <hi>R. B.</hi> 1. Your repeated miſtake of my

                  <note place="margin">Whether all the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution.</note>

not, I paſs by. 2. Every one that is by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
conſequence <hi>guilty of our ſilencing</hi> doth
not <hi>conſent</hi> to it. Otherwiſe You, and I,
and all the ſilenced Miniſters in <hi>England</hi> do
<hi>conſent</hi> to it. For he is blindly impenitent
that will deny that we are any way guilty
of it.</p>
               <p>3. You do but cover one open ſin with
another;<note place="margin">Slander.</note> even ſeparation with uncharitable
ſlander of many hundred godly Conformable
Miniſters, whom you accuſe of this conſent.
I know ſcarce any one of my acquaintance
whom I take for a faithful diligent Paſtor,
and whom I perſwade men to hear, but they
are grieved at the heart for the ſilencing of
ſo many and ſuch. I hear ſome complain
of it privately, and ſome lament it publickly,
and earneſtly pray that God would reſtore
them; But I never heard one of them
own it.</p>
               <p>4. I plead not for <hi>Vndoing, Pernicious ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence:</hi>
I think too many are deeply guilty
by it: My teſtimony in this caſe is viſible
among the Writings whoſe number you
prove me proud by. But if you make this
a proof of the duty of ſeparation, you will
make mad work of it. For, 1. You know
not mens opportunities to ſpeak: And
where there is no opportunity, there its no
duty. 2. You know not who hath ſpoken
their diſſent plainly and who not. It may
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:63037:58"/>
he ſome have done it in the Convocation: It
may be ſome have done it privately,<note place="margin">Of repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſins of others.</note> and
ſome publickly already in due ſeaſon. And
we are not to expect an account from them
of all that they ſay. 3. To whom is it that
you would have all the Countrey Miniſters
ſpeak againſt our ſilencing? To thoſe that
did it they have no acceſs; and they are
out of hearing. And muſt they needs
talk to the people of their ſuperiours actions,
and ſpeak againſt them behind their backs?
4. If we know that one, two, twenty have
ſpoken or written plainly in reproof of a ſin,
are all the Miniſters in the Land bound to do
the ſame over again? Muſt they all leave their
flocks to come up to <hi>London</hi> to do it? Or
muſt they every one publiſh his reproof in
Print? 5. All ſilence, or not-reproving is not
a ſeeming conſent: much leſs in Gods ſight
little different from <hi>perſecution.</hi> Were all
the Churches in the Empire Perſecutors, or
to be ſeparated from, which did not reprove
the Emperours for baniſhing <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> and
<hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> and ſuch others? Of all the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced
Miniſters in <hi>London</hi> or <hi>England,</hi> how
ſmall a number is there that have <hi>[ſharply
reproved]</hi> the ſilencers? And perhaps they
that have done it moſt ſharply may have
been more ſharp than did beſeem them.</p>
               <p>To conclude Readers,<note place="margin">Narrow Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</note> mark here by this
reaſon how few you muſt hold communion
with in the Land or in the world, if you
will be the Diſciples of Mr. <hi>Bagſhaw;</hi> Away
from Conformiſts and Non-conformiſts that
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:63037:59"/>
have <hi>[ſharply reproved]</hi> perſecutors. This
is the way to be able to gueſs at the names
and numbers of thoſe that by his rule you
muſt Communicate with.</p>
               <p>5. But what if they have <hi>ſharply reproved</hi>
this one ſin? you cannot prove that they
themſelves have done ſo by <hi>all other ſins:</hi>
Even you your ſelf have left ſome unrepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:
And will not the want of the <hi>ſharp
reproving</hi> of other ſins as well as of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
make your communion with ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful?</p>
               <p>6. But at the worſt; <hi>not reproving</hi> can be
but a particular ſin? And it is not every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
ſin that maketh Communion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful.</p>
               <p>7. And have you firſt admoniſhed them of
that ſin, and tryed all theſe Miniſters whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they be penitent? Yea or ever heard
them ſpeak for themſelves? Or do you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 15. and make to your ſelf
and followers a new Law, that whomſoever
you ſhall ſuſpect or accuſe of ſin, you muſt
alſo ſeparate from?</p>
               <p>8. But by this rule of yours, methinks
few if any ſhould be liker to be accepted in
your communion than my ſelf, if <hi>reproving
perſecution</hi> would ſerve turn. And yet even
I alſo am rejected by you, as being not <hi>wiſe</hi>
or <hi>good</hi> enough to communicate with ſuch as
you, but as one of the worſt of Hereticks to
be rejected of all.</p>

done; while you teach the world, that it is
but little different in the ſight of God, to

ſo diſown it. For if it make the ſins of my

I ſhall not be innocent if I <hi>reprove</hi> not <hi>you</hi>

ſome worthy and able men, among the Pariſh
Miniſters (which for my own part I believe
never a whit the more becauſe you affirm it)
yet this we muſt ſay, that their ſin is great in
ſubmitting to ſo undue a way of entering into
the Miniſtry; and therefore we both forbear
our ſelves, and warn all others not to hear
them; becauſe we cannot think our Lord Chriſt
ever ſent ſuch to Preach in his name, who di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
and by a ſolemn Oath have renounced
their Chriſtian liberty under pretence of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Chriſt; and are indeed nothing elſe (as to
the whole diſcharge and exerciſe of their office)
but ſervants of men—in conſiſtent with being

               <p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:63037:60"/>
                  <hi>R. B.</hi> 1. Either you think there are ſome
<hi>worthy able</hi> men among them, or you do
not. If you do, why ſhould you be ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant
as to queſtion the aſſertion of it, and
ſo loth to grant it? If you do not, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
is ſo falſe and malignant an accuſer of the
brethren,<note place="margin">All ſinners are not to be ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from.</note> to be the conducter of ſouls, or the
Hiſtorian of the age, that will not <hi>know</hi> a
thing ſo publick and notorious.</p>
               <p>2. As for your not believing me, no men
are ſo hardly brought to believe the truth
from others, as they that are conſcious of
ordinary falſhood from themſelves.</p>
               <p>3. I think I could prove <hi>their ſin</hi> as effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
as you can: But muſt we ſeparate
from <hi>all ſinners?</hi> or from all that ſin in
their <hi>entrance into the Miniſtry?</hi> And why
not as well from all <hi>other ſins</hi> of equal great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?
Do you warn all others not to hear
your ſelf? Or do you yet take your ſelf to
be no ſinner? or no great ſinner? What if
the Presbyterians think the Independents
way of entrance to be <hi>undue?</hi> And the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents
think ſo of the Presbyterians?
And both of the Anabaptiſts? and the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts
of them both, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Muſt they all there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
warm all men not to hear each other?
Mr. <hi>Nye</hi> thought not ſo, when he wrote for

the Author of two Books of Calumnies and

4. Moſt that I ſpeak of did enter into the

way heretofore, and do but <hi>continue</hi> on the

How then can you ſay they <hi>unduely enter into
the Miniſtry?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. Did you know before you wrote this,
that all ſuch as we perſwade men to hear,
have by <hi>Oath</hi> renounced their Chriſtian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty?
what Oath is it that you mean? If
you mean the Oath of Supremacy or Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance,
unleſs Popery be Chriſtian Liberty,
we know of none ſuch which theſe renounce.
And I know of no other Oath, except that
of Canonical obedience <hi>in licitis &amp; honeſtis.</hi>
And for that, 1. I find not that the Act,
or Canons do impoſe it on thoſe that come
for Ordination; (nor am ſo well skil'd in
the Law as to know by what Law it is
done;) 2. I know that men have been or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
ordained without it. And to
ſuch your reaſon for ſeparation is vain.
3. Mr. <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> and other old Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts
were wont to ſay that they obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Dioceſanes, and ſo did promiſe them
obedience, only as they are the <hi>Kings Officers,</hi>
deputed for the exerciſe of that <hi>Civil or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercive

that give away?</p>
               <p>4. But ſuppoſe that you are the

Canonical obedience,<note place="margin">6th Falſe doctrine.</note> and the Oath

Is it not falſe doctrine to conclude, that
Chriſt never ſent out any that had as great
a ſin as this? what none? when he ſent out
<hi>Judas</hi> himſelf, who was firſt a Thief and
after a Traytor? Do you think then that
Chriſt ever ſent out Lyars, Railers, furious

                  <hi>as to

and untruth. He that is a ſervant of Chriſt,
and a true Paſtor of a Chriſtian Church, and
a ſound Preacher of the Goſpel, and an helper
of believers faith, and a lover of the peoples
ſouls, and a diligent upright labourer for
mens ſalvation, is ſomething elſe than a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
of man (even in the diſcharge of their
Miniſterial office.) But ſuch are many of
the Conformable Miniſters: <hi>Ergo</hi>—</p>
               <p>Prove if you can that Dr. <hi>Preſton, Sibbes,
Stoughton, Whittaker,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bolton, Whateley,

ſave eight or nine at moſt (being all Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts)
<hi>were nothing elſe but the ſervants of

Your Father thought otherwiſe of Mr. <hi>Bolton,</hi>
and perhaps they were both as wiſe as you.
Prove now that Mr. <hi>Gurnal,</hi> Mr. <hi>Trap,</hi>
Dr. <hi>Lightfoot,</hi> Dr. <hi>Walker,</hi> Mr. <hi>Langley,</hi> and
many others that I can name that are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
men in <hi>London</hi> and round about it, are
nothing elſe but the ſervants of men? And
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:63037:61"/>
will it not be as hard to prove one to be a
ſervant of Chriſt who ſerveth Satan by
<hi>falſhood</hi> and <hi>malice,</hi> and <hi>calumniating Chriſts

<hi>it not the queſtion,</hi> which <hi>is the queſtion,</hi> is
untrue.</p>
               <p>2. We have here another taſte of your
inſolency: To call them Magiſterially <hi>[weak</hi>

not to examine, nor once notifie to the

is, nay which we ſuppoſe you in the

the words ſave one, and implicitly as to
that: For <hi>Defective</hi> and <hi>faulty</hi> are words
that you condeſcend to uſe: And when you
ſay [a Church] you muſt mean a <hi>Church</hi>
that hath Truth of Eſſence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or elſe you ſpeak

                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:63037:62"/>

Am I not free? 4, 5. Have we not power to
eat and to drink? Have we not power to lead
about a Siſter, a Wife, as well as other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles?
12. If others be partakers of this power
over you, are not we rather? Nevertheleſs we
have not uſed this power, but ſuffered all
things leſt we ſhould hinder the Goſpel of
Chriſt.—15. But I have uſed none of theſe
things—19<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For though I be free from all
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:63037:64"/>
men, yet have I made my ſelf ſervant to all,
that I might gain the more: And unto the
Jews I became a Jew, that I might gain the
Jews; To them that are under the Law, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Law, that I might gain them that are
under the Law: To them that are without
the Law, as without Law, that I might
gain them that are without Law. To the
weak I became as weak, that I might gain
the weak: I am made all things to all men,
that I might by all means ſave ſome. And
this I do for the Goſpels ſake—<hi>See 1 Cor.

               </p>
               <p>1 Cor. 16. 25, 28, 29, 30, 31. <hi>Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is ſold in the Shambles eat, asking no

ſay unto you, This is offered in ſacrifice to
Idols, eat not, for his ſake that ſhewed it, and
for conſcience ſake</hi> (Thus our liberty is not
to be exerciſed againſt <hi>Love:</hi> for we have no
liberty to hurt our <hi>brethren) 29. Conſcience
I ſay, not thine own, but of the others: Thus
others by weakneſs,</hi> and conſequently Rulers

Conſcience is the Rule of my Right, or his
judgement taketh away my title to liberty;
but his intereſt and the Law of Love, do
take away my Right of <hi>uſing</hi> my liberty to
anothers hurt. 3. <hi>For if I by grace be a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker</hi>
(that is, lawfully according to my
Chriſtian liberty) <hi>why am I evil ſpoken of
for that for which I give thanks,</hi> (that is, it
is a fault in thoſe that accuſe me of ſin, when
I do that which is lawful, in it ſelf, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted
from the Conſequents or ſcandal):
<hi>Whether therefore ye eat or drink,</hi> (which

               <p>I beſeech you therefore <hi>while you promiſe

them the <hi>ſervants</hi> of <hi>ſin, 2 Pet.</hi> 2. 19. And
take notice that <hi>Liberty</hi> muſt be diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

                  <hi>to preſerve our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty?
Paul</hi> hath here ſhewed you another
way: 1. By doctrinal defence to defend it
againſt falſe Teachers, that would doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
brings us into bondage. To maintain
againſt ſuch as you who add to Gods Laws,
that we are not bound to do that which is
not commanded, or to forbear that which
is not by God forbidden, though you ſay
we are. 2. <hi>To uſe our Liberty</hi> as it tendeth
to Gods glory and mans good, and <hi>diſuſe</hi> it
when it croſſeth theſe, (but not deny our
<hi>right.</hi>) This is the Scripture way of preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it: and not to think that we have no
way to preſerve it, but by doing hurt, or
croſſing Love by Church-diviſions.</p>
               <p>3. No falſhood is a juſt defence of our
Chriſtian liberty: But to ſay, that a true
Church is no true Church, or true Worſhip
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:63037:65"/>
is no true Worſhip, or that it is not Lawful
to communicate where it is lawful, is a
falſhood. Therefore it is no juſt defence of
our Liberty.</p>

2. That being preſent where they are uſed,<note place="margin">9. Falſe doctrine.</note>

               <p>Where note, 1. That it is not <hi>Part of the

he ſpeaketh of. 2. That I proved the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to both theſe at large, and the man
ſaith only that he hath my <hi>word for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,</hi>
and giveth not a ſyllable of anſwer to
my twenty inſtances, and many undenyable
reaſons to the contrary. Doth he not either
highly eſteem his own reaſon and authority,
that thinketh it ſhould be received, if he do
but ſay the word, without attempting to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
whats ſaid againſt him: or elſe doth he
not greatly deſpiſe his own Readers and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers,
in taking them for ſuch credulous
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:63037:66"/>
ductile ſouls, as will take his bare word
without expecting <hi>any</hi> reaſon from him to
confute what is ſaid on the other ſide? Or is
all this on preſumption, that his Reader will
not know what I have ſaid? <hi>Sermon Notes,

all theſe are not therefore unlawful.</p>
               <p>And I proved that all Miniſters, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies

is not therefore lawful to ſeparate from
them all. If you your ſelf ſay that you ſay
nothing in preaching or praying but what
is commanded you, and that your Worſhip
hath no ſin, you deceive your ſelf, and the
truth is not in you. <hi>But</hi> if you think it a
ſin for any to hear you, or have communion
with you, why do you not plainly tell
your hearers ſo? To keep far from a falſe
matter, (as from writing falſhoods by the

ſins, is one thing; and for Children to tell
their Fathers, or People their Paſtors, we
muſt not worſhip God with you, becauſe

Peace is but ill bought, if we muſt purchaſe it
at ſo dear a rate as the loſs of truth: And
this Truth concerning the ſole Soveraign Power
of our Lord Chriſt in appointing all matters of
his Worſhip—is a point ſo neceſſary to be
maintained, and ſo utterly inconſiſtent with the
ſuppoſing that any thing is to be obtruded
which he hath not commanded, that we dare not

which may prejudice that fundamental.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>R. B.</hi> 1. How oft have I anſwered that

hear it again in the old confuſion without
any notice of what hath been ſaid. See my
Treatiſe of <hi>Infant Baptiſm</hi> on that point par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly.
Do I fell thirty three Truths,
when I read thirty three untruths in your
Writings? Do I ſell Truth, if I ſhould hear
you preach or pray erroneouſly, and <hi>impoſe</hi>
your confuſed prayers on the people? or
impoſe this or that <hi>Metre</hi> or <hi>Tune</hi> on them in
ſinging of Pſalms?</p>
               <p>2. Here you ſay <hi>[Matters of Worſhip]</hi>
before it was <hi>[in Worſhip.]</hi> And even the
word. <hi>[Worſhip]</hi> is taken ſo variouſly, as
calls for explication, before we determine
whether man may appoint <hi>matters of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip:</hi>
For if you will call <hi>[putting off the

and Metres, and Tunes, and the <hi>Method</hi> and

the name of <hi>Worſhip,</hi> then man may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
it.</p>
               <p>3. It is an untrue ſuppoſition, and but a
begging of the queſtion, that our preſence
with any thing obtruded unlawfully, is a
prejudice to that fundamental of the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty
of Chriſt. All men that ſin do ſin
againſt his Soveraignty: And all that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude
any thing unlawfully, ſin againſt it by
that obtruſion. But if you obtrude a raſh
and paſſionate prayer on the people, or an
erroneous or diſorderly prayer, or an ill-compoſed
Hymn or Pſalm, their preſence is
no approbation of your error, nor denying
of Chriſts Soveraignty.</p>
               <p>Do you, or can you believe and make all
your followers believe, that the Synagogue-Worſhip,
and the Temple-Worſhip were
kept ſo pure, by the Prieſts, Levites, and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees
in Chriſts dayes, as that there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of humane Tradition obtruded? Or
nothing but what God commanded? Can
you believe this? Or can you believe that
Chriſt was not uſually or often preſent
there? See Luke 4. 16. <hi>At</hi> Nazareth <hi>where
he had been brought up, as his cuſtom was, he
went into the Synagogue on the Sabbath day</hi>—And
of <hi>Paul</hi> its ſaid, Acts 17. 2.
<hi>As his manner was, he went in to them, and
three Sabbath dayes reaſoned</hi>—Or do you
believe, that Chriſt was a ſinner? and that he

1. That in the Primitive Churches
there were many corruptions, which the Apoſtle

of them to ſeparate. But I anſwer—It is not
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:63037:68"/>
corruption or error barely conſidered as ſuch, that
we account to be a ſufficient ground of ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration:
But the Impoſing of that error with
on high hand, and making a ſubmiſſion to it
(at leaſt in our practice and outward obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance)
the very condition of Communion:

all this ſo fully, why will you deign to
confute a Book, while you diſdain to take
notice what it ſaith?</p>
               <p>1. Who would have thought that you are
ſo much looſer in your communion than we
are? I will ſeparate from that Church which
in the eſſential matter (<hi>Paſtor,</hi> or <hi>all the

to any eſſential point of Chriſtianity, though

blended and hudled up together, but—to
be an holy ſeparate people—and
to depart from unrighteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>R. B.</hi> 1. Remember Reader, (for <hi>he will

that it is not <hi>Corruption</hi> and <hi>Error barely as
ſuch, that is a ſufficient ground of ſeparation,</hi>
without <hi>Impoſition:</hi> And now here is nothing
but <hi>Mixture</hi> of <hi>Holy</hi> and <hi>Vnholy.</hi> Reconcile
theſe if you can.</p>
               <p>2. Chriſt that was <hi>perfectly ſeparated from

a ſinner is ſuch as Chriſt never</hi> called
<hi>or</hi> deſigned <hi>him to be. But your Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

[Whatever Church is ſuch as Chriſt did not

with: But all the Pariſh Churches are
ſuch as Chriſt did not call or deſign them to
be; Ergo—<hi>The Minor you prove,</hi> What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever

unholy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is ſuch as Chriſt did not call or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
them to be: <hi>But the</hi> Pariſh Churches are
ſuch—</p>
               <p>But I anſwer you; 1. A Church is no
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:63037:70"/>
Church that <hi>wants</hi> the <hi>Eſſentials</hi> required by
Chriſt: But he that will not communicate
with Church or perſon that wants the <hi>Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
which Chriſt <hi>calleth them to,</hi> ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
with no Church or perſon on

               <p>2. The word <hi>[mixt]</hi> is ambiguous; and
implyeth a double act; one of the <hi>Impure

the other of the <hi>holy,</hi> who joyn

And it followeth not, that if a

to have Communion with that Church in

all Churches into ſtrife and bitter envyings,
confuſion, and every evil work. For <hi>Railers</hi>

muſt be avoided: And if any member of
the Church ſhall think that one Railer, or
one Covetous perſon is kept in unjuſtly,
away they muſt go, and condemn the Church
as unworthy of Communion. And who
will not think that read your Book, that
you would be one of the firſt accuſed of
<hi>Railing?</hi> Yea, how few even of the ſtricteſt
ſeparating <hi>Churches</hi> are they, that neglect

be it may be a rich or powerful man, that
will perſecute or divide the Church if he be

               <p>6. But Sir, our queſtion is not only of

               <p>4. They that voluntarily neglect their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
(without hinderance by the force of
men) are more to be blamed than thoſe that
are ſo forced. But in the Primitive Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
Diſcipline was lamentably neglected
voluntarily; as appeareth in the Caſe of
moſt of the ſeven Churches, <hi>Rev. 2. &amp;</hi> 3.
for which they are threatned by Chriſt, and
in the <hi>Corinthians</hi> caſe: yea, corrupted by
ſuch as <hi>Diotrophes.</hi> And do you think that

not through diſability, but negligence

which they fell into in the ages after,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>An Vniverſal degenerating in the Eſſentials

being ſo early, if I can underſtand you, you
do (as the <hi>Seekers</hi>) unchurch the univerſal
Church of Chriſt. For if it <hi>Degenerated
Vniverſally in the Eſſentials of doctrine, it
Vniverſally apoſtatized from Chriſtianity:</hi> For
where any <hi>Eſſential</hi> part is loſt, the <hi>Eſſence</hi>

let not raſhneſs or paſſion blind you to over-overlook
the dreadfulneſs of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
               <p>1. If Chriſt had then no Church (as he
had not, if the <hi>Eſſential degeneration</hi> was <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal</hi>)
then he was no King of the Church
on Earth,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi>'s do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note> no Lord, no Teacher, no Saviour
of the Church; no Interceſſor for it in the
Heavens? And do you not then dethrone
him, and deny him indeed to be the Chriſt?
What, <hi>a Head without a Body?</hi> A <hi>King</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a <hi>Kingdom?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. So you will make all Gods Promiſes of
his Churches perpetuity, as built on the

if the whole Church failed, and the Promiſes

               <p>3. If all the Church apoſtatized, how ſhall

               <p>4. And then the Article <hi>[I believe the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <p>
                  <hi>R. B.</hi> 1. Whether by <hi>[our Churches]</hi>
you mean only the <hi>Pariſh Churches</hi> of <hi>godly
Miniſters,</hi> or alſo <hi>All</hi> the <hi>Proteſtant Churches,</hi>
and <hi>all other Vniverſally</hi> through the world, I
am not ſure: But as far as I can conjecture
by your words you mean; <hi>All.</hi> Becauſe
you ſpeak of them as in a <hi>Continuance in
part</hi> in the <hi>Vniverſal degeneration</hi> in <hi>Eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als;</hi>
And you ſpeak of them as avoiding Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
but in part, and call them <hi>[our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,]</hi>
and mention no Church in the world
here that you own as a true Church (and
whether any where in all your writings I
remember not.) I confeſs I pretend not
to know the mind of ſo careleſs a Writer by
any words, but very plain ones: But if
this be your mind as it ſeemeth to be, you
would do well (being ſo bold a man)
to tell the world your mind more plainly:
And you that think that no Truth is to be
ſold (as you call it) for Peace, let Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents,
Presbyterians, Separatiſts, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> know it, if indeed you think
that all their Churches are to be ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from, as well as the Pariſh Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.
If this be your mind, I ſuppoſe you
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:63037:75"/>
are but a <hi>Preacher</hi> to <hi>Auditors</hi> your ſelf, and
not a <hi>Paſtor</hi> to any <hi>Church.</hi> He that thinks
no Truth ſhould be concealed for fear of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering,
ſhould not carry it in darkneſs and
diſſimulation to the Paſtors and Churches
about him, if really he believe them to be
no Paſtors or Churches, or not to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
with. But I think that you bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
deſerve to be diſowned by them, than
they by you.</p>
               <p>Certainly few or no Proteſtant Church,
that I have known, will ſay that it is <hi>reſtored
to the primitive pattern</hi> and <hi>Purity</hi> in <hi>degree.</hi>
If that therefore be your meaning, you do
ſeparate from all the Churches in the world.
But if you mean not, <hi>in Degree,</hi> but in
<hi>Eſſence,</hi> I ſtill challenge you to prove that the
Churches in queſtion want any thing <hi>Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial;</hi>

But when errour is once impoſed,

And if we ſhould miſtake a point of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogie

us. This is ſomething.</p>
               <p>2. Well, but what is the crime that
maketh our Communion unlawful? <hi>[when
errour is once impoſed,</hi> &amp;c.] ſo then (if you
can ſpeak ſenſe) <hi>any errour Impoſed</hi> will do
it. What if it be Impoſed on the Church,
to uſe a Tranſlation of the Bible that hath
ſome errour in (And is there any with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out?)
Muſt that Church needs be ſeparated
from? And yet the Church that uſed the
ſame Voluntarily (and therefore more ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully)
is not to be ſeparated from? What if
erroneouſly it be impoſed on <hi>the Church to
meet at an inconvenient time or place?</hi> What
if ſome flaw or errour in Chronologie on
ſmaller-matters, were in their impoſed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
which the Paſtour erroneouſly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth
to? It ſeems an <hi>Infallible Impoſing
Church</hi> may be communicated with, and no
other. But do you not know that there is a
<hi>Miniſterial as well as a Magiſtratical forcing</hi>
Impoſition? Every Paſtour that ſpeaketh as
by Commiſſion from Chriſt, Impoſeth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
on the people! He Impoſeth doctrine,
and Method, and words in prayer, and
times, places, utenſils, orders, metres, tunes,
as aforeſaid. Muſt all theſe be ſeparated
from (that is almoſt all the Paſtors in the
World;) And is there no remedie?</p>
               <p>3. But perhaps you lay all the ſtreſs <hi>[on a

ſtrong hand and force!]</hi> If ſo, prove that
your <hi>Miniſterial Impoſition</hi> of errour in your
Prayer or Conduct, doth not make Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
unlawful; and yet that forcible impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
doth? As if <hi>Voluntary</hi> reception made
leſs the ſin! Prove that the Church of the
Jews was nullified whenever any errour was
impoſed by authority! Or when the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees
then in power had corrupted it in Chriſts
time by force. If this were your meaning,
then ſeparation could ſcarce be Lawful, till
there was a <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> a Chriſtian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
who (being not infallible) might
force or impoſe ſomething amiſs, whereas
you before talk of an <hi>early univerſal failing,</hi>
neceſſitating ſeparation. It ſeems then that
no Countries are ſo unhappy as thoſe that
have Chriſtian Magiſtrates, who being falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
impoſe ſome errour: And that in all
the Ages and Countries that have Heathen
or Infidel Rulers, (notwithſtanding Church
Corruptions not forced) Separation is a ſin.</p>
               <p>4. But I would fain know, whether it be the
<hi>Impoſition,</hi> that nullifieth the Church, or makes
Communion unlawful, or only the <hi>obeying</hi> that
Impoſition? If it be the <hi>Impoſition,</hi> then a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Prince may nullifie the Church at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.
If it be only the <hi>obedience,</hi> then, 1. Muſt it
be <hi>once obeying</hi> or <hi>continual?</hi> What if <hi>Aurelian</hi>
or <hi>Diocleſian</hi> forbid Church-aſſemblies: will
once obeying them nullifie all the Churches,

force only that doth it; And Independent, or

from that are falſe? Do not corrupt Copies

they not do ſo to his?</p>
               <p>10. How can he judge of the various

               <p>12. Is any man <hi>Infallible</hi> in <hi>Tranſlating?</hi>
Is there a <hi>promiſe</hi> of Infallibility to them?</p>
               <p>13. Do not the Tranſlations differ?</p>

And how ſhall he judge of thoſe he ſeeth
not?</p>
               <p>16. Is it by <hi>Inſpiration</hi> from Heaven, ſuch
as the <hi>Prophets</hi> had, that the true Reading
muſt be <hi>known?</hi> or to ordinary (at leaſt
ſanctified) Reaſon by evidence in the Text it
ſelf? If the former, none but Prophets can
know it. If the later, you can prove it to
a Rational or ſanctified man, from ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſick
evidence. For inſtance ſuppoſe a
man never ſaw but two Printed Engliſh
Bibles, and was never told which is right
by others, and in one is Printed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 2.
he <hi>[deſpiſed the ſame] viz.</hi> the <hi>Croſs,</hi> and in

17. Do all the Men and Women that are
Godly actually know the true and uncorrupt
copies and readings, by the Book it ſelf
without mans teſtimony? Or what is the
name of that one Man or Woman in the
World that you know, who without ever
hearing it from man, could tell all the true
readings from the falſe, or could tell that the
<hi>Canticles</hi> or <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> or the Book of <hi>Jonas</hi>
were Canonical, and that the Book of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruck,
Wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtle to the <hi>Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diceans,</hi>
and <hi>Clemens</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> were
not. Do you know his name, that ever
knew this by Reading the Bible only, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being ever told it by any? If not, and if
it be <hi>ſine quâ non</hi> to mens receiving of the
Bible it ſelf, that ſome one brings it to their
hands; judge how wiſely and fairly you
deal with poor ſouls to talk at ſuch a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
and yet confuſed rate.</p>
               <p>And, 18. Let me ask you one queſtion
more; Is it neceſſary to Salvation that men
be able <hi>to read?</hi> Hath God promiſed it to
all or moſt that ſhall be ſaved? Faith com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
by hearing, as the moſt ordinary way of
old: And he that will Preach the Goſpel
to moſt Nations under Heaven, muſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
more than can read, or but a few. And
if you Preach the Goſpel to a Congregation
that cannot read, do you recite all the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
readings in the Hebrew and Greek to
them? If not, can they judge of that they
never heard? If you do, are they ever
the wiſer as to know of themſelves
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:63037:81"/>
which of them is the right?</p>
               <p>19. But if you ſay that you ſuppoſe not
only Grace but great Learning and Study
to diſcern theſe things, how cometh it to
paſs that the moſt Learned, Studious and
Godly men do ſtill ſo much differ about
the various Readings? (as <hi>Lud. Capellus,
Vſher, Heinſius, Bootius, De Dieu,</hi> and
others.) And how come the Churches in
the Ages next the Apoſtles to leave out ſo
many Books of the Canon as many of them
did, while others received them? And <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Althamar</hi> and others, to ſet no more
by <hi>James</hi>'s Epiſtle than they did? And ſo
many Godly men long, and yet, to receive
much of the Apocrypha?</p>
               <p>20. How durſt you that ſpeak ſo hardly
of the Jeſuits, honour them ſo much as to
make your ſilly ones believe, that their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
in this is no worſe than mine, when
in ſo many Books, I have left that at large
which may confute you?</p>
               <p>And you (wiſely) ask me to tell you
<hi>whether I will take the Jeſuits into my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,</hi>
becauſe they hold the ſame with
the Arminians with whom I will commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate!
ſo they hold the ſame with all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
that there is a God, and a Chriſt and
the Scripture true? But it is not for this that
I renounce their Communion, but for ſome
things elſe. Will you communicate with
none that holdeth any thing (yea any er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour)
which the Jeſuits hold? Or did you
dream that the Arminians hold all that the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:63037:82"/>

Arminians hold all that the Jeſuits hold?

this poor man, who here openly tells thee,
that either he underſtands not common ſenſe,
or elſe takes no heed what he ſaith, but
bringeth a new untruth to juſtifie a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,

in his act. He telleth you the

<hi>Vntruth</hi>) becauſe I ſaid <hi>[Many think

us to ſubdue.]</hi> Here he firſt leaveth out
ſeveral words, eſpecially the word <hi>[inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate]</hi>
becauſe he read not the later Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
And yet he put in the word
<hi>[only]</hi> which the Printer in the laſt Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
hath left out, and which openly ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the falſhood of his charge. Is it all
one to ſay, that [by <hi>Fleſh is meant not only
Indwelling ſin,</hi> and to ſay <hi>It is not meant at
all?]</hi> Do you think he took any heed of
the word <hi>[only]</hi> when he wrote it? My
buſineſs (not in the Premonition as he
miſ-reports, but in the <hi>Epiſtle</hi>) was to
prove the ſinfulneſs of <hi>fleſh-pleaſing,</hi> and
that when the Scripture bids us <hi>ſubdue the
fleſh, and make no proviſion for it,</hi> &amp;c. It
doth not only mean, <hi>ſubdue the habits of
Indwelling ſin in the underſtanding and will,
and make no Proviſion for them, but</hi> alſo
that we muſt prevent <hi>actual ſin by ſubduing
the ſenſitive appetite</hi> unto reaſon, and
ruling it by faith, and that even Original
and habitual ſin it ſelf conſiſteth partly in
the <hi>Inordinateneſs</hi> of that Appetite; And
here I implyed this proof from the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the Name; <hi>q. d.</hi> [If the ſin to
be ſubdued be called <hi>Fleſh,</hi> then the
Fleſhly appetite is not wholly to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded;
For there is ſome reaſon why ſin
is called <hi>Fleſh,</hi> rather than <hi>Spirit.</hi> And
what can the reaſon be, but that 1. The
ſenſitive appetite it ſelf is <hi>Inordinate,</hi> and
ſo part of the ſeat of ſin; and 2. The
underſtanding and will are enſlaved to the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:63037:84"/>
ſenſe or fleſh, and are vitiated with a ſinful
inclination to ſerve the fleſh or ſenſe it
ſelf: And therefore he that readeth in
Scripture ſuch paſſages as require us to
ſubdue <hi>the fleſh,</hi> he muſt not deceive him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
by thinking that it is <hi>only Indwelling
ſin</hi> (that is in the ſuperiour faculties) that
is meant by fleſh, and that <hi>the ſenſitive appetite</hi>
is not here meant at all, When as 1. <hi>Original
ſin it ſelf is partly in the ſenſitive appetite;</hi> And,
2. <hi>Actual ſin</hi> is to be reſiſted by ſubduing
the <hi>ſenſitive appetite</hi> to reaſon, and bringing
the body into ſubjection as well as <hi>Indwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſin.</hi> to be extirpated. And if the Name
of <hi>Fleſh</hi> be put upon <hi>Indwelling ſin,</hi> from
the <hi>Fleſhly</hi> intereſt and Inordinate appetite,
then ſurely this it ſelf is not wholly to be
excluded, as no part of the ſenſe of the
word <hi>Fleſh</hi> in Scripture. And when my
words plainly expreſs this ſenſe, with what
face could this man, not only put other
words upon me, which were none of my
own, but alſo another ſenſe, and a ſenſe
clean contrary to the words? And this
to juſtifie a former falſhood; And this
after that in divers Writings I have fully,
and plainly diſputed of <hi>Original</hi> ſin as it]
is the corruption of the <hi>ſuperiour facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;</hi>
and in divers Books about Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
ſhewed the neceſſity of the cleanſing and

all the mortification of ſin, and reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

If I did miſtake here I recant my errour;

3. The Book doth plead for that opinion.
4. His Epiſtle is before the Book as a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing

that opinion to this day. And all theſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances
might induce ſuch a judgement of
him. But if he took it up between the

               <p>[6. That I impoſed abſtinence upon my

and nonſence in a Woman are more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable
than in her Teachers: Why doth
She render <hi>a Reaſon</hi> why She durſt not
eat, if by that <hi>fear</hi> and for that <hi>reaſon</hi>
ſhe did not impoſe abſtinence on her ſelf?
Did <hi>any other</hi> impoſe it, or ſhut her
mouth? Is not that our own doing
which we give a reaſon of, and ſay that
we did it through fear? Doth not he
that giveth a Thief his Purſe, conſent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to it, and make it his own act to
ſave his life? If ſhe knew not what ſhe
did, why is ſhe angry for being thought
Melancholy, (which is many a Godly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
caſe?) If ſhe did know, why doth
ſhe falſly call it an untruth, that ſhe impoſed
it on her ſelf? By this taſte you may
ſee that even in well-meaning people the
ſame principles will oft have the ſame
practices, when here are five untruths in
this ſhort Letter, and four at leaſt of her
accuſation of my words are viſible un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths.</p>
               <p>But I would know of Mr. <hi>E. B.</hi> or her,
whether it be true doctrine, <hi>that one out
of Chriſt ſhould not eat, becauſe they have
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:63037:94"/>
no right,</hi> and whether almoſt to conſume
her ſelf with Famine was well done? If
ſo, muſt all wicked men do ſo? If it be
falſe doctrine (as undoubtedly it is) I
further ask, whether it was the ſpirit of
God, or Satan that was the Author of
it? I hope ſhe dare not father ſin and
falſhood on Gods Spirit: And if it was
a <hi>Temptation</hi> of <hi>Satan</hi> (as it was) I
ask whether to yield ſo far to a Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſo much againſt the light of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
nature, and ſelf-preſervation, in a
caſe ſo plain that common people know
the errour of it, and to proceed ſo long
almoſt to famiſhment in that errour and ſin,
I ſay, whether this ſhewed not ſome flaw at
that time in <hi>natural underſtanding</hi> and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as well as in <hi>grace?</hi> If it did (as ſure it
did) what could it be leſs than Melancholy?
And I hope it was never the mind of
Mr. <hi>Jordan,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Browne</hi> in that Book,
to father this opinion or practice on Gods
ſpirit. I doubt not but God thus oft
tryeth his own; but it is as little doubt
but that he oft leaveth them under Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
as the Tempters opportunity and
advantage. And its pitty that poor ſouls
ſhould be angry with thoſe that know their
caſe, better than they themſelves, and truly
pitty them.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Joſeph Baker</hi> then Preacher in <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter</hi>
(a man of unqueſtionable Prudence
and Credit, now with Chriſt) told me
all that I have ſaid of this Woman, and
that ſhe had not been at Church of a long
time before, and was paſſing along the
Streets, and was ſuddenly moved to go in
to the Church at Lecture time; and that
ſhe was ſtruck as aforeſaid at the hearing of
the Text, and before Sermon was done
could hardly forbear crying out in Church;
and that ſhe had on the conceit of their
ſtrictneſs faln in among the Quakers; and
been often at their meetings; but hearing
them ſpeak againſt <hi>Scriptures</hi> and <hi>Miniſters</hi>
was troubled, and thought that they ſpake
that which her experience would not ſuffer
her to conſent to: and that ſhe was like in
theſe perplexities to fall into great Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly,
and her body alſo to be weakened by
the troubles of her mind, and that through
his motion or perſwaſion ſhe was deſirous
to ſpeak with me: I had no reaſon to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
belief to him: When I came next to his
houſe the Gentle-woman came to me, and
he and ſhe together repeated the ſubſtance of
all this again, and ſhe ſpake not a ſyllable
againſt it: And ſpeaking a few words to
diſſwade her from the <hi>Quakers</hi> in haſte, I
never ſaw her more: The ſaid Mr. <hi>Baker</hi>
told me after of all her ſad and Melancholy
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:63037:99"/>
abſtinence and weakneſs, and of Mr. <hi>Browne</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Jordanes</hi> frequency with her;
And ſhortly after ſhewed me the Book, with
Mr. <hi>Brownes</hi> Epiſtle to it, and told me that
which they now thus quarrel with, that
Mr. <hi>Browne</hi> was one of the publiſhers of it,
and was for the doctrine in it. Though I
diſcerned by the Book that ſhe her ſelf was
taken with that point. Theſe things I
long heard affirmed and confirmed, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
contradicted till this day, and now you
hear that the <hi>Timeing</hi> of Mr. <hi>Brownes Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi>

                  <hi>R. B.</hi> Here are three more viſible <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths</hi>
in point of fact, 1. That I argue
againſt the <hi>Divine Authority</hi> of the Scripture;
yea or the <hi>ſelf-evidencing</hi> either; which I
have written for at large in three ſeveral
Treatiſes. 1. In the 2d Part of my Saints
Reſt. 2. In a Book called the Unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs
of Infidelity. 3. In my <hi>Reaſons of
the Chriſtian Religion,</hi> moſt fully: but never
wrote a word againſt it. 2. That I do
with <hi>my induſtry and cunning labour to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
our foundation:</hi> Hath this man written
more for the foundation than thoſe three
Books? 3. That <hi>I deny any certainty but what
may be gathered from the truth of Hiſtory:</hi>
For which he citeth not one word in which
I ever ſaid ſo, nor can: But the contrary is
legible in the forecited Volumes, at large.</p>
               <p>As to the matter of his Accuſation I will
not here write another Book, to tell men
what I have written in the former: Read
my own words, even thoſe he accuſeth, and
my Treatiſe for the Chriſtian Religion, and
judge as you ſee Cauſe; But for them that
will believe him to ſave them the labour
of reading it in my own Books, as if ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
man were liker to tell rightly what I
have written than the Books them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
I leave them to judge, and do
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:63037:101"/>
as they are, and as ſuch men lead
them.</p>
               <p>And how far Tradition or Hiſtory, or
Humane aide and Teſtimony is neceſſary
to our Reception of the Scripture, I have
long agoe opened at large in the Preface to
the ſecond Part of my Saints Reſt, and
ſhewed you that Dr. <hi>Whitaker, Chemnitius,
Davenant, Rob. Baronius</hi> and other Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
uſually ſay the ſame that I do, and
that otherwiſe by caſting away <hi>ſuch ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
means,</hi> Proud-ignorance and pieviſh
wrangling will cut the throat of faith it
ſelf, and undermine the Church of God.</p>
               <p>Reader, I will conclude alſo with an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition
as my Accuſer doth; As thou
loveſt Chriſtianity, Scripture and thy ſoul,
take heed of thoſe <hi>Ignorant deſtroying-defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
of the Scripture, who would tell the
Infidel world, that they may continue Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels
till we can prove, that the <hi>Scripture
alone by its own light,</hi> without humane
Teſtimony, Hiſtory or Tradition, will bring
it ſelf to all mens hands without mans
bringing it, and will tranſlate it ſelf, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

The Scripture and Chriſtian Religion taken

ſelf which may prove that <hi>frame,</hi> and <hi>all the
eſſential</hi> parts of our Religion to be of God;
And the true proof of the Divine Authority
of the Scripture, is by the evidence of the
<hi>ſpirit;</hi> not a <hi>new Revelation</hi> of the ſpirit;
But by a double <hi>Impreſſion</hi> of <hi>Gods own Image
made by the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> one upon the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
it ſelf,</hi> The other by the Scripture in
its continued efficacy on <hi>Belivers ſouls:</hi>
And both theſe Images are the Impreſſes of
the Trinity of Divine Principles, even of
the <hi>Power, Wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs of God;</hi>
which are unimitably done in both. This
is the true proof that Scripture is the word
of God.</p>
               <p>But this proof excludeth not but ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
the Miniſtry and Teſtimony of man as
a ſubſervient help and means; even to bring
it to us, to tranſlate it, to teach us how to
know both the ſenſe and verity of it, and
to teſtifie which is the true Canon, Copies,
Reading, Tranſlation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And they are
ignorant ſubverting deceivers and deſtroyers
of your ſouls, who would ſeparate the
<hi>Word,</hi> the <hi>Spirit</hi> and the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> which
Chriſt hath conjoyned as neceſſary together
for your faith: and that would caſt out ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient
helps as unneceſſary under pretence
of the ſufficiency of the Scripture. As if
<hi>Printing</hi> it were needleſs, becauſe Scripture
is ſufficient of it ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:63037:103"/>
And the fore-ſaid ſelf-evidencing Light is
not ſufficient without humane help and Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
to make you know <hi>every Canonical
Book</hi> from the <hi>Apocryphal,</hi> nor to know the

the Oath of Allegiance that they are ſilenced,

to the words which conclude the life of
Mr. <hi>Powel, That ſince ſuch a time he hath

BUT I have one thing more to Advertiſe
the Reader of, that I was too blame to
believe Mr. <hi>Bagſhaw</hi> in his recitation of my
own words, in his <hi>pag.</hi> 5. where he ſaith
that [of <hi>Cromwell</hi> himſelf, though he
dyed in his ſinful Uſurpation without mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſting
any repentance, I give this Saint-like
Character in my <hi>Pref.</hi> to the Army, The
late Protector did prudently, piouſly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
exerciſe the Government.] Having noted
that I ſpake againſt <hi>Oliver</hi> a few leaves
diſtant, I too raſhly believed Mr. <hi>Bagſhaw</hi>
that this paſſage was ſpoken of him too.
But upon peruſal I find it is moſt notorious
that I ſpake it of his Son, when the Army
had brought him to a reſignation, which any
man may ſee that will peruſe the place.
Hereafter therefore I will not ſo haſtily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
ſo common a—in what he writeth
of the moſt viſible ſubject, of my ſelf or
others.</p>
