            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>HAD I! O had I! <hi>Batt,</hi> thy face and throat,</l>
            <l>Could I betune the Flock with such sweet note,</l>

            <l>And rob Church-Pews, to crown thy head with Bays.</l>
            <l>Or had I for thy sake the Triple-sconce</l>

            <l>Clerk, Poet, Cutler, Baw, waw, waw, besides</l>
            <l>That Cardinal vertue, for on Mules it rides,</l>
            <l>Patience I mean, in which thou dost excel,</l>
            <l>As all thy Neighbours and thy Wife can tell;</l>
            <l>Three Trumps then would I sound to thy renown,</l>
            <l>And from thy Fame immortalize my own.</l>
            <l>Ingenious <hi>Batt!</hi> by Trade and Nature fit</l>
            <l>To set an Edge both on our Knives and Wit.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Vulcan,</hi> they say, made mighty Arms for <hi>Mars,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>(Cuckolds are kind) but he ne'r made a Verse.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Apollo</hi> he made Verses, but in's life</l>
            <l>I never heard that ere he made a Knife.</l>
            <l>Now <hi>Batt</hi> does all that both these Gods could do;</l>
            <l>Hammers out Verses, and hard Iron too.</l>
            <l>To sheath strong sense in Metaphorick words,</l>
            <l>Is but the making Scabbards for his Swords.</l>
            <l>He is a two-fac'd Pump, whose Spouts do run</l>

            <l>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:45782:3"/>
Have you not seen the thing our Butler uses,</l>
            <l>With cabin'd belly, things call'd double Cruises?</l>
            <l>The right side Vinegar, the left holds Oyl;</l>
            <l>The Emblem's <hi>that</hi> of Wit, and <hi>this</hi> of Toyl.</l>
            <l>Such is the Skull of <hi>Batt,</hi> in which the Brains</l>
            <l>Are parted into Poetry and Pains.</l>
            <l>He writes and works so equally, you'd think</l>
            <l>One Cheek were black'd with Smoak, t'other with Ink.</l>
            <l>Thrice-happy temper! for what makes our life</l>
            <l>More pleasant than a good Wit and good Knife?</l>
            <l>Without their help, who can good <hi>Christmas</hi> keep?</l>
            <l>Our Teeth would water, and our Eyes would weep:</l>
            <l>Hunger and Dulness would invade our Feasts,</l>
            <l>Did not <hi>Batt</hi> finde us Arms against such Guests.</l>
            <l>He is the cunning Engineer, whose Skill</l>
            <l>Makes Tools to carve the Goose, and shape the Quill:</l>
            <l>Fancy and Wit unto our Meals supplies;</l>
            <l>Carols, and not minc'd meat, make <hi>Christmas</hi>-pies.</l>
            <l>'Tis Mirth, not Dishes, sets a Table off;</l>
            <l>Brutes and Phanaticks eat and never laugh.</l>
            <l>What man of Teeth then can be so ingrate,</l>
            <l>To slice Roast-beef, and not remember <hi>Batt?</hi>
            </l>
            <l>When Brawn with powdred Wig comes swaggering in,</l>
            <l>And mighty Serjeant ushers in the Chine,</l>
            <l>What ought a wise man first to think upon?</l>
            <l>Have I my Tools? if not, I am undone:</l>
            <l>For 'tis a Law concerns both Saint and Sinner,</l>
            <l>That he that hath no Knife, must have no Dinner.</l>
            <l>So he falls on; Pig, Goose, and Capon feel</l>
            <l>The goodness of his Stomach, and <hi>Batt</hi>'s Steel.</l>
            <l>In such fierce Frays, alas, there no Remorse is;</l>
            <l>All Flesh is Grass, which makes men eat like Horses:</l>
            <l>But when the Battle's done, off goes the Hat,</l>
            <l>And each man sheaths, with God-a-mercy <hi>Batt.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>So when the Mistris cannot hit the Joynt,</l>
            <l>Which proves sometimes, you know, a difficult point,</l>
            <l>Think on a Cuckold, straight the Gossips cry:</l>
            <l>But think of <hi>Batt</hi>'s good Carving-knife, say I;</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:45782:3"/>
That still nicks sure, without offence and scandal:</l>
            <l>Dull Blades may be beholding to their Handle;</l>
            <l>But those <hi>Batt</hi> makes are all so sharp they scorn</l>
            <l>To be so charmed by his Neighbours Horn.</l>
            <l>When I the Edges of his Ware have seen,</l>
            <l>(Seen they could not be, they were all so keen)</l>
            <l>When I have found their Temper all so good,</l>
            <l>From the long Rapier to the Oyster-spud;</l>
            <l>Happy, thrice happy 'tis, I us'd to say,</l>
            <l>For all mankind, who wish for length of day;</l>
            <l>That <hi>Batt</hi> no Cutler is unto the Fates;</l>
            <l>His Sheers would cut our Threads off at strange rates:</l>
            <l>Snip—'tis no more; there's work for <hi>Batt,</hi> and die</l>
            <l>We must, to finde him Cakes and Elegie.</l>
            <l>O mortal men! is Eating all you do</l>
            <l>At Christ-tide? or the making Sing-songs? No:</l>
            <l>Our <hi>Batt</hi> can dance, play at high Jinks with Dice,</l>
            <l>At any primitive Orthodoxal Vice.</l>
            <l>Shooing the wild Mare, tumbling the young Wenches,</l>
            <l>Drinking all night, and Sleeping on the Benches.</l>
            <l>I'll say that for him, were he to be hang'd,</l>
            <l>He is as true a Blade as ever twang'd.</l>
            <l>Shew me a man can shuffle fair and cut,</l>
            <l>Yet always have three Trays in hand at Put:</l>
            <l>Shew me a man can turn up Noddy still,</l>
            <l>And deal himself three Fives too when he will:</l>
            <l>Concludes with One and thirty, and a Pair;</l>
            <l>Never fails Ten in Stock, and yet plays fair.</l>
            <l>If <hi>Batt</hi> be not that Wight, I loose my aim;</l>
            <l>If any else pretend unto the same,</l>
            <l>And say we dare not match him for a Pot,</l>
            <l>They lye—provided <hi>Batt</hi>'s Wife knew it not.</l>
            <l>Heark, the Bell toll at <hi>Holy-Roods;</hi> away</l>
            <l>To Church, this is <hi>Batt</hi>'s Exercising-day.</l>
            <l>He's sally'd out from sign of Pole and Bason,</l>
            <l>With Clergy-Cloak, clean Band, and Sunday face on.</l>
            <l>Some commend Eunuchs chanting in the Quire,</l>
            <l>But how they should learn Prick-song, I admire.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:45782:4"/>
Some praise their Skill who in white Surplice sing</l>
            <l>Fa, la, fa, sol, Anthems, or some such thing:</l>
            <l>But let them not our smutty Clerk despise;</l>
            <l>Blackbirds still whistle better than Magpies.</l>
            <l>Their charming Trills and Thrombo's must give place</l>
            <l>To the melodious Consort of <hi>Batt</hi>'s face;</l>
            <l>Where Eyes and Nose, Mouth, Beard, and Chin agree</l>
            <l>In each sweet Note: A Quire themselves they be;</l>
            <l>And better Musick it most times appears,</l>
            <l>To see his Strains, than hear the best of theirs.</l>
            <l>Then at the Godly Twang, the two last Sta—aves,</l>
            <l>Without which, Service is but done by halves:</l>
