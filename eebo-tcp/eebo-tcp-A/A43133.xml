            <title>The precious blood of the son of God shed without the gates of Jerusalem for the redemption of lost and undone sinners: whereby his great love to mankind is undeniably manifested, in these following particulars; his agony in the garden; being betrayed by Judas, being falsly accused before Annas, Caiaphas, Herod and Pilate; his being scourged, scorned, and spitefully used; his condemnation and going to execution; how he was crucified; of his being reviled, and pardoning the thief upon the cross; and of his giving up the ghost. All which is practically applyed and improved, for the bringing of sinners out of the way of sin and hell, into wisdom's ways, whose ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>BY the reading of this small Treatise, you may in some measure, be made sensible of what Christ hath done for you in order to your everlasting Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Wherein his great Love is manifested unto all: <hi>For greater Love hath no Man than this, to lay down his Life for his Friends;</hi> but he hath laid it down for his greatest Enemies, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem them from everlasting De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction. By these sad and dolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Sufferings of our Saviour,
<pb facs="tcp:32116:3"/>
we may see also what a dreadful and Soul-destroying thing Sin is, that nothing but the precious Blood of the eternal Son of God could make Satisfaction for it. Oh what Cause have we then to admire and adore the mighty God of Heaven for his infinite Mercy towards us, in sending his Son, his only begotten Son, <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> to redeem us from Death and Hell! Seeing such great things have been done for us, let us make it our daily Practice and Business to walk in some measure answerable to them: That we may so do, is, and shall be the hearty Prayer of your Soul's Cordial Friend;</p>

            <head>OF Our Saviour's Agony IN THE GARDEN.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>Matth. Chap. 26. Ver. 38.</bibl>
               <q>Then saith he unto them, My Soul is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sorrowful, even unto death; tarry ye here and watch with me.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>AND not designing to take notice of the Meanness of his Birth, and that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Course of Sorrow and Misery, that attended the former part of his Life; wherein he took up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him not only the Form of a Sinner, but a Servant: I shall consider the time only towards his Death; wherein, in a most especial manner, his great love to Mankind is manifested: For as every natural Motion groweth more ardent
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:32116:4"/>
towards the end; so the Love of Christ towards the true Church, his Spouse. Not that he loved us better in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of his Life; but it did then most appear: As some sort of Fire, the more Water is thrown upon it, the hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it burns; so both the Apprehension and Presence of Death was so far from lessening his Love, that it did rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease it.</p>
            <p>Therefore, as in all the Passages of his Life, so more especially towards his Death, all his Doctrine was Holy, Just, and Good, <hi>(Milk for the Weak, Meat for the Strong, Medicine for the Sick, not too deep for the Simple, nor too shallow for the Wise)</hi> but as a Ford wherein the Lamb may wade, and the Elephant swim; all his Actions were the Works of Justice and Mercy, Examples of all Vertues, but most especially of Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which is the Foundation of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Vertues, as Love, Pity, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion, whereof our Miseries stood most in need.</p>
            <p>His Life was so Pure and Holy, that by that Example he hath set us, we may plainly see what is either want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or amiss in our selves, even the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:32116:4"/>
Book which the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> speaks of, That he saw, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 2. written within by Instruction, without by Example of Life; wherein we have what to <hi>contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate,</hi> what to <hi>imitate,</hi> and what to <hi>admire:</hi> So that whosoever doth not only study, but like the Prophet, seek, he shall attain inestimable, both <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Vertue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When our Saviour begun his Passion in the Garden of <hi>Gethsemane,</hi> he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with those three Disciples, who not long before had seen his Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Transfiguration upon Mount <hi>Tabor;</hi> to the end, that seeing so great a Change, they might be sensible of the greatness of God's Severity, and of his Love. O Treasure of Heaven! O Light and Life of the World! How was his Glory ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scured! his Strength abated! his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage appaled! insomuch that he did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge to his Disciples, <hi>that his Soul was heavy unto death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Saviour began his Conflict with Prayer, giving Example to us, in all our Troubles to do the like; teaching us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in what manner we ought to pray; first, <hi>in that he did fall prostrate upon the Ground,</hi> he did thereby instruct us, that with the greatest Humility
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:32116:5"/>
and Reverence we must present our selves before the Majesty of Almighty God: Secondly, <hi>by his earnest praying,</hi> with what fervency of Spirit we ought to beat at Heaven Gates. Thirdly, <hi>by his often praying,</hi> we have an Example of Perseverance, until he that doth engage us to beg, shall let us have his Favour so far as to obtain. Lastly, <hi>He hath taught us to renounce our own Wills, and to resign our Desires to the pleasure of Almighty God.</hi> These things, if at all times we endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to perform, but especially in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonies of Death, the Angels will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come to comfort us; for God will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly send us strength to bear, what he is not pleased to remove.</p>
            <p>But wherefore did our Saviour pray, <hi>That if it were possible this Cup might pass from him?</hi> Did he not freely and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily offer up himself for Sin to save Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners? yes, desirously; for no necessity could be cast upon him; no complaint of Justice, because he was innocent; no necessity through weakness, because he was Almighty, for he had twelve Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Angels at his Command; but it was to comfort and strengthen his weak-hearted Members, that their Courage
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:32116:5"/>
might not be cast down under any Tryal or Tribulation that God might call them to! And also he did hereby declare, That he did bear the natural Weaknesses of our Flesh: For none can possibly ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine the greatness of those Sorrows and Miseries that he went through.</p>
            <p>Lastly, he would manifest to us, That he did consist of two Natures, and two Wills; not so separate as to make two Persons, nor so confounded as to make one Nature and Will, but distinguish'd in their essential Properties and Operations. In his Humane Will, he did pray to avoid this Cup; in his Divine Will, he did desire it. He did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire Death, in regard of the end; but in regard to it self, he did pray to avoid it. Yet his Humane Will was not contra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>y or repugnant to his Divine Will: Yet being surprized with the fear of Death, through the frailty of his Hamane Will, he seemed not to think of that which he perfectly did know; not as drawing or declining from his Father's Will, but forthwith resuming his Resolution, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted himself to his Decree.</p>
            <p>There is no Question bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

were exceeding great; yet nothing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to the Torments of his Soul. In bodily Pains 'tis possible some have born as much as he: But as for the Sorrow of his Soul, the unspeakable Sorrows of his Soul there was never any came near him: And indeed, the Pain of the Body is not comparable to the the Sorrow of the Soul, Prov. 18. 14. <hi>The Spirit of a Man shall sustain his other Infirmities: But a woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Spirit who can hear?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And first begun his Sorrows in his Soul. For as Sin beginneth always at the Soul, and from thence extendeth to the Body, it was most proper that the Punishment of Sin should begin at the Soul, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards proceed to the Body.</p>
            <p>This Grief of Soul of our Saviour's was very great, as one of the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists testifieth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 37. <hi>He began to wax sorrowful, and grievously troubled:</hi> Another, <hi>Mark</hi> 14. 34. <hi>He began to be afraid, and in great heaviness:</hi> and says, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 14. <hi>He was in an Agony.</hi> But in a more peculiar manner he did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press it himself, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 38. <hi>Now is my Soul tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ubled, now is my Soul heavy even unto death;</hi> and also by Actions
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:32116:6"/>
in that when no violence was offered to his Body, no Man stood near him to do him any harm; he was so much inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pressed in Spirit, and in so great an Agony, that in an extream cold Night when he lay upon the cold Earth, all the Forces of his Body were distracted, the Humours disturbed, the Pores opened, and he was cast into a great and bloody Sweat: not a thin faint Sweat, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of such great Drops, which issued so plenteously from every part of his Body, that they came through his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, and trickled to the Ground in great abundance, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 44. Sure never was any Garden thus watered, never Ground thus wet. <hi>Adam</hi> might moisten the Earth with the Sweat of his Brows; but never was it moistned but at that time with a bloody Sweat.</p>
            <p>O let us therefore look upon our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and upon our selves: Upon our Saviour as upon the true <hi>Adam,</hi> not cast, but came out of Paradice of his o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

were at that time his only Tormentors; for the Executioners did not then tear him with Whips, they did not then press a Crown of Thorns upon his Head. It was not the Nails nor the Spear that then did pierce him, but it was our Offences that did so much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict him; our Sins were the heavy Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then under which he did so grievously sweat.</p>
            <p>For then were represented to him the Sins of the whole World, both past and to come; which to him who bears so great a Love and Zeal to the Honour of his Father, it could not but be an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable Sorrow and Trouble to him.</p>
            <p>Then also was presented to him the most terrible sight in the World, the great Fury of the Father, before whose Majesty, when he is moved to Wrath, the Angels cover their Faces, the Mountains sweat, the Earth trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth, the Sea flyeth; before whom, if he appears as Judge, no Creature can stand; and verily, if the Wrath of God against one Sinner, for one Sin, be term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Unquenchable Fire, a Worm that d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Words can the Wisdom of Men devise to represent the <hi>terribleness</hi> of that Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that was against him, who was to drink of the whole Cup of his Father's Wrath; not for one Sin only, but for the Sins of the whole World; and if he had left one drop, if he had not drank up the very Dregs, we had not been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused from eternal Damnation. Also he beheld the Ingratitude of many, who would not endeavour to make any profit to their own Souls, of this great Benefit, which doubtless was a sharper cut to him than all the outward Torments he endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; ever as it is less grievous to a Man to take pains for another, than to know that his Pains shall not be regarded.</p>
            <p>Our blessed Saviour did bend under this heavy Burthen, and dipt his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in his own Blood; and he took the Cup of his Father's Wrath, which had no mixture of Mercy in it: He did lay upon his Shoulders a light Burthen, and a sweet Yoke: but we have laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him an unmerciful Load, which none but himself is able to bear. No Element is heavy in its proper place; and therefore as one that diveth into the Water, feeleth not the Weight of the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:32116:9"/>
Water which is above. So he that is plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the depth of his Sins, has no sense how heavy they are, because Sin is there in its natural place, But Sin in our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour was out of its proper place, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove its Sphere, and therefore lay the more grievously upon him. For if a Sinner that is sanctified is oftentimes pressed with his own Sins, that he crieth out with holy <hi>David,</hi> Psalm 38. <hi>My iniquities are a sore Burthen, too heavy for me to bear:</hi> How grievous must this Sea of Sin be to him who is Sanctification it self, and from whom it all flows?</p>
            <p>O heavenly Father! What is this that thy innocent Son, thy only Son, thy Son in whom thou art well pleased, in this humble and heavy manner laboureth before thee? <hi>Their Fathers hoped in thee, and thou didst deliver them; they called upon thee, and were not confounded.</hi> Wherefore then is thy innocent and only Son, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of thy Substance, forsaken of thee? How shall we sinful Wretches expect to find any Mercy with thee, seeing thou art so seve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

when thou seest this miserable Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle of him that is so dear unto thee? This bloody Sweat, whereof every drop is of greater value than a Thousand Worlds? Is it not a sufficient Satisfaction for our Sins, a sufficient Price for our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption? O admirable and upright Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice! for this was but a small Skirmish to the main Battel which did follow after. Sure if thy Eyes, Holy Father, were fix'd upon the Cross, whereunto thy on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Son was fastned, thou wouldst not be satisfied nor appeased, because thou hadst before ordained, that Death, which was a Curse belonging to Sin, must also be the Punishment of thy Son; that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil that prevailed by a Tree, should also be by a Tree subdued.</p>
            <p>O what a painful Purchase has our Saviour made! what a sharp Price has he paid for our Redemption! how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable may we think was the end of his Sufferings, when the beginning was so dreadful! and how cruel were those Torments, that were by him to be endured, which were so terrible in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing feared! O therefore let the sight of our Sins draw some Drops of Tears now

from our Eyes, seeing they did draw so many Drops of Blood from every part of our Redeemer's Body: Take a little touch of that Grief which did lie so heavy upon him whose Power sustaineth the Heavens, that it made his Soul heavy unto death, being so deeply drowned in the Nature of Man, that he seemed to forget that he was God. Let us accuse and condemn our selves of all manner of unworthiness, and take up with a godly Sorrow, both for love to our Saviour, and in hatred to our Sins; the one for suffering for our sakes; and the other for being the only cause of it; and let us not be like to the Disciples that were with our Saviour, who fell into a sound and secure Sleep, whilst their Master both watched, prayed, and sweat a bloody Sweat for their Redemption: He was like a loving Father, who spares no pains to get Bread for his Children, whilst they remain free both from Trouble and Care: If drowsiness of Spirit overcomes thee, pray to God to awaken thee with his Heavenly Voice; if that will not do, to make you smart with the Rod of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, that so you may watch and pray lest you fall into Temptation.</p>

               <p>BUT when the Son of God did in so high a degree, both love and value the Sons of Men, that he thought nothing painful to himself that might be profitable to them; yet see how the Sons of Men did either value or love the Son of God; they took all Occasions, first to slander him, and afterwards to slay him; they sold him one to another for thirty Pieces of Silver.</p>
               <p>O devilish and malicious Spirits, to hate the Author of our eternal Salvation. As no means are thought bad enough to bring him to his Death, so to underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue the Lord of all Creatures, as not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Beasts are sold at so base a Price! O infinite inequality of Affection between God and Man! God came to save Man,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:32116:11"/>
and Man goeth about to destroy God: God bought Man with the dearest Drops of his Blood, and Man sold God for Thirty Pieces of Siver: O the Love of the Lord Jesus was great, when he came to redeem those that were lost, and the Saviour of the Redeemed, how great was his Love, to come into the World, when he had no need, nor we any Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <hi>to sanctifie it with his Justice, to enrich it with his Grace, to enstruct it with his Doctrine, to confirm it by his Example, to redeem it with his Blood?</hi> that as by the Pride of one, who being but Man, did aspire to be God, we were condemned; so by the Humility of another, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, became Man, we should be saved.</p>
               <p>Being sold at the Price of Thirty Pieces of Silver, to such cruel Merchants as desire no Profit by him but his Life, the Traytor <hi>Judas,</hi> whose Feet a little before he had washed, came unto him, attended with a bloody Band: And how willing our Saviour was to embrace his Passion, did appear by his voluntary presenting himself to them, and in that he turned not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his Face from this barbarous Beast
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:32116:12"/>
that came to kiss him. But, O innocent Lord! What hast thou to deal with Traytors and Tormentors? What Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie between the Lamb and the Wolf? What Commerce between God and <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our Saviour did not only permit <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> to kiss him, but he did also smite his obstinate Heart with this soft Speech, <hi>Friend, wherefore comest thou? dost thou betray the Son of Man with a Kiss?</hi> But wherefore did our Saviour call <hi>Judas</hi> Friend, when he had betrayed him? To testifie, that altho' the Knot of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship was broke on his part, yet on our Saviour's it remained whole and entire, to reduce him again to his Friendship; for if he could have said without despair, with holy <hi>David, I have sinned,</hi> he should presently have heard, <hi>I have forgiven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If our Saviour had kissed <hi>Judas,</hi> he should never have despaired, or destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himself; for his Kisses inspire Life; and therefore the Spouse beginneth the most excellent <hi>Canticle</hi> with these Words, Cant. 1. 1. <hi>Let him kiss me with the Kisses of his Mouth.</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 10. <hi>It is he that hath loved us first.</hi> Ephes. 1. 4. <hi>It is he that hath chosen us, and not</hi>

               <p>But they proceeded notwithstanding to lay Sacrilegious Hands upon him, as upon a Malefactor, to bind his Holy Hands (which had wrought so many Miracles among them) with rough and knotty Cords, his Disciples either for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking of him, or falling off from him; and to lead him away in a more oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious manner than the Ark of the Testimony was taken and carried away by the Uncircumcised <hi>Philistines.</hi> Poor

and miserable <hi>Jews,</hi> whom do you thus hale away? Against whom have you taken up Arms? Your Prisoner hath made you Captives; he whom you have bound with Cords, hath chained you with Fetters of Iron; he hath been to you as a Bait, or a Hook that taketh the Takers: Never was Force so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately applied: Never was Prey so impossible to be held, and so dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to be let go; for he soon got out of your Hands, but you shall never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void his Curse. O People, well beloved, thy malicious Madness hath made thee miserable, thou art ruinously cast down, thou art finally cast out, and that which was no People is planted in thy place: You came with Torches and Lanthorns to apprehend the Son of Truth, but you would not see his glorious Light, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you remain the blindest People in the World; insomuch that all the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies that have been spoken of you have been performed by you against your selves.</p>
               <p>But what Folly is this, O ye <hi>Jews!</hi> how far is it beyond all Folly, to carry him with Bands of Men, that went of his own Accord? into whose Brain

               <p>He that hath power to give Life un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Dead, could he not have kept himself in Life?

Assure your selves such was his infinite Charity, wherewith he goeth to the Cross, to appease his Father's Wrath, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem the Sins of the World, that you should have more to do to keep him in Life, than you have to carry him to his Death: He hath far greater, both care and haste to redeem you, than you can possibly have to murder him; for he had not redeemed us, if his Death had been forced upon him; if his Sacrifice had not been vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary, it had not been satisfactory; we could not have been saved by his Obedience, if he had not died of his own accord; and the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:32116:14"/>
he whom Death is able to kill: But Death had no such Power over the Son of God, for he did voluntarily lay down his Soul, even when he would himself. O senseless <hi>Jews!</hi> He that is to bury so many Figures, to fulfil so many Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, to accomplish so great a Business as the Redemption of the whole World, to what end should he run from you?</p>
               <p>By all this you may see what base abuse was offered to the Son of God; Certainly if it had not been the Will of his Father, and of himself, it had been better that Mankind should have rotted in their own Corruption, than that infinite Vertue, perfect Felicity, the true Glory, the eternal Word and Wisdom of the Father, should be so basely and vilely abused by those Sons of <hi>Belial.</hi> But since it was his Pleasure, because by this way he would manifest his Love, it is our part to accept it with thankful Hearts, and with Reverence, both to love, honour, and praise him for the same.</p>
               <p>Therefore let us lift up our Voices at all times, and in all places, to the Praise of Almighty God, for this his

Our Saviour was seated in Majesty and Glory, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vironed with Angels, hearing the sweet Harmony of his own Praise, doing wonderful things in Heaven, and in the Earth, and in all the deep places: But we lay in the Mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour bowed down the Heavens, and came down; not by changing place, but by manifesting himself in a holy Humanity: He was admirable in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but he became miserable and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible upon Earth: He changed the Name of Majesty into Mercy: and did cover himself with the Sackcloth of Mortality, and did enter, as it were, into Perdition, wherein he did both

willingly wallow and take delight: But our Saviour received no Spot nor Soil; but he did stretch forth his Hand to the Work of his Hands, whereby he drew sorth; he did cleanse, he did cloath, he did comfort and confirm us, he did reach forth his Hand by his blessed Birth, he did draw us by his Doctrine, he did cleanse us by his Death, he did cloath us by his Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, he did comfort us by his Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and he did confirm us by his send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Holy Ghost; therefore let us praise and magnifie the Lord for his great Love towards us; for in all his Works he was ours mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

which is like to an Eccho, a meer emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Sound without Substance which feeds and flatters us with wrong Names, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing our foolish and idle Fancies, till we fall into the Pit of everlasting Destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: For we may easily see and find by daily experience how variable Men are in their Opinoins, constant only in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constancy and persisting in nothing more than in change.</p>
               <p>They who cryed <hi>Hosanna</hi> in the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, soon after cry, Let him be crucified: They who saluted him for their King, do presently profess, That they have no King but <hi>Caesar:</hi> They who met him with Olive Branches, do now present him with Swords and Staves: They who did spread their Garments before him, now take his own Garments from him: They who did acknowledge and adore him for the Son of God, they in few days prefer <hi>Barabbas,</hi> a Thief and a Murtherer, before him: Therefore by this you may see what cause we have to give credit to the Judgment of the Men of this World.</p>
               <p>Who will trust the Love of this World, which is so uncertain? Who will be so base as to fawn upon it for a few crumbs

               <p>Behold, from hence we may draw both Divine and Moral Comforts in all Miseries, that either Malice or Unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness can bring upon us; Divine, for that no greater Reproach, Shame, or Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my can befal us, than did our Lord and Master for our Sakes: Moral, for that we may see how foolish and false the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of Men are, prone always to judge well of the wicked, and hardly of the Good.</p>
               <p>For behold, here Vertue is counted Vice, Truth Blasphemy, and Wisdom Folly. Behold the Peace maker of the World is judged a seditious Person? the Fulfiller of the Law, a Breaker of the Law; our Saviour a Sinner, our God a Devil. Wherefore should we murmur or repine at any Trouble that doth befal us? God handleth thee no otherwise than he did his only Son? no nor so bad neither; and it is not only a Comfort, but a Glory, to be a Partner

               <p>Blessed be the Name of the most high God, who is the Comfort of our Life, the Light of our Eyes, the End of our Desires: All his Angels and Saints, yea, all Creatures for ever praise him, for by the Merits of his unspeakable Charity and Humility, he bowed his back to endure the Misery that was due to us for our Sins.

               <p>Now when <hi>Pilate</hi> saw that <hi>Jesus</hi> looked so pitiful, he thought the sight of him sufficient to break the blood Purposes of his Enemies; he led him forth to the People, and said, Behold the Man! what would you have more? if it be for Malice that you are so vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent against him, behold how mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable he is!

Certainly this shewing of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus doth plainly shew he was made a woful Spectacle; so woful, as <hi>Pilate</hi> did verily believe, that the very sight of him would have moved the hardest Heart to relent, and say, This is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough we desire no more.

Although our Saviour was accused of Blasohemy, of which he was guiltless, yet the Death of the Cross is not that Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that is due for such a C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>But all this was done that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures might be fulfilled: The Death of the Cross was appointed by the Father, and accepted by the Son; it had been prefigured and prophesied: Jesus him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self had foretold more than once, That he should be delivered by the Jews to the Gentiles to be crucified. What then shall we say, but with the Church of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> acknowledge, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 27. <hi>That Herod and Pilate, with the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles and People of Israel assembled, to do whatsoever the Hand and Counsel of God had determined.</hi> Many times before, when the Jews went about to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend our Saviour, they wanted Power,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:32116:23"/>
as <hi>John</hi> 7. 30. and 10. 30. when upon suspicion of Blasphemy, they would have stoned him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 59. when they would have thrown him headlong from the edge of an Hill, he easily escaped them, <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 29. even in the day time in their popular Cities environed with the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Throngs, because then his time was not come, and also these were not the Deaths appointed for him: But when the time came that the Jews should deliver him to the Gentiles to be condemned and crucified, he voluntarily submitted himself into their Hands.</p>
               <p>For when the time was come, he would not escape, nor the Jews could desire no other Death for him, but the Death of the Cross. Among all that vast Multitude, there was not any vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety either in Voice or Opinion; they all agreed to take away Life from the Son of God; they all agreed he should be crucified; they all agreed to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer <hi>Barabbas,</hi> who had slain the living, before him who had brought the dead to life. If we separate the Work of God from the Work of Man, we shall find the greatest Mercy in saving Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:32116:24"/>
and the greatest Cruelty and Malice in oppressing of a Friend. This is usually two Properties of the Wicked, first in Matters of Vertue to disagree; so many Men, so many Minds; but in Wickedness and Mischief, being quickned by one Spirit, they all jump in one Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, always concur in one Desire.</p>
               <p>Seeing then that our Saviour <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>And if we find nor feel no Compassion of those Pains and Anguishes he endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, we may assure our selves we want the true Love that we ought to have for him; for they who love, are always truly sorrowful for the Miseries and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities of those they affect.

               <epigraph>
                  <bibl>Matth. 27. 22, 22.</bibl>
                  <q>Pilate saith unto them, What shall I then do unto Jesus, which is called Christ? They all said unto him, Let him be crucified. And the Governour said, What evil hath he done? But they cryed out the more, saying, let him be crucified.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>NOW although <hi>Pilate</hi> had openly declared, That Christ was inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and also that he had Authority to acquit him, yet gave way either to the Favour or Fury of the Jews, rather than to Justice, he pronounced Sentence of death against him, and delivered him to his cruel and merciless Enemies: O un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just President! by thy own Judgment, thy Judgment was unjust, for thou gavest Sentence of death against him, whom
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:32116:26"/>
thrice before thou hadst pronounced In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent. Certainly in thee, O President, this was the greatest piece of Injustice thou couldest possibly have committed; but it was a just Sentence of the High President of Heaven, before whom all the Sins of the World stand in naked view; and who will not suffer one of them to pass unpunished: therefore because the whole World was not able to make satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for one Sin, he drew the Sword of his Justice, and smote therewith his Innocent Son, who only was able of all Men, both to bear and to break his Wrath off from Sinners for Sin. But O just Judge! thou art never stirred to Wrath but by Sin; thou art never very wrath but with great Sins. At this time thy Wrath was very great, and thou didst grievously smite thy only Son; but in him thou couldst find no Sin at all.</p>
               <p>What! didst thou not only release Offenders, but with <hi>Caiaphas</hi> the High-Priest, cause the Innocent, without cause, to be smitten? And is it not more against the Law of Justice, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the Innocent, than to discharge and acquit the Guilty? How then may we count it Justice, which doth not
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:32116:27"/>
only release Offenders, but also punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Innocent? O Light! which had decreed this Mystery in thy holy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel from the beginning, open thou our Understandings, break off the Mistiness from our Minds, that we may plainly see and understand this great Work of Justice and of Mercy, which is more admirable than all thy wonderful Works besides.</p>
               <p>Certainly he is not unjustly charged, although he oweth nothing from himself, that undertaketh another Man's Debt; nor doth the Judge do any more wrong in giving Sentence against a voluntary Surety, than if he gave it against the principal Debtor.

               <p>So then it was his Love, and his Father's Justice that cast him into these Extremities; Love entreated that Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners might be saved; and Justice exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted that Sin might be punished: To satisfie both which Suits, the mean

thee, and making them obedient to thy Will. Seeing we have so rich a Treasure, so liberal a Distributer of the same; how is it possible we should not rise in Hope? Justice hath sound out a way to strike the Innocent, and cannot Mercy find a means to save the Guilty?

               <p>If therefore we have the greater, we have no cause to sear the less: for Justice has executed her Severity upon the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and Mercy will shew her Favour up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Offenders.</p>
               <p>Yea, if it was Justice that the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent should be condemned and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, for to make Satisfaction for Sin, it is Justice also, that the Offenders for whom he suffered, should be discharged from that Debt, that the voluntary Surety hath fully paid: Therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Grace is not due to a Sinner, as a Sinner, yet it is due to him as he is redeem'd.

To be sure he will find there no sick Persons to cure, no Devils to cast out, no Temples wherein to teach; but there he will find Dead to raise, and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to forgive, there he will find many scattered Souls of executed Offenders, which expect his coming, which as the true <hi>Elizeus,</hi> thy dead Body should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store them to Life?</p>
               <p>What should all this mean, that our Saviour has not only made choice of an infamous Death, but of an infamous Place; the Place was infamous, but the Death was accursed; <hi>for cursed is every one that hangeth on a Tree:</hi> It did not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie his Love to die for us, but he must die the most accu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Certainly our Saviour's Death con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth many Mysteries. It is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for us to say, that he died for us, but we are further to consider how

ye would die; which was by the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious death of the Cross: with whom also? even with Malefactors: When? in the principal strength and beauty of his Age: In what Year? in the great Year of Jubilee: Upon what Day? at the great Solemnity of the Passover, even when they did celebrate the Figure of him: In what place? on the Mount of <hi>Calvary,</hi> only made glorious by his Death.</p>
               <p>He was neither privily made away, nor tumultuously slain; he dyed not in a Corner that dyed for all the World; he was condemned in the publick place of Judgment, and suffered upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon place of Execution: upon a Day and a Year of the grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>It was objected against him, that he was a Friend to Publicans and Sinners: True, he was a true Friend to them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but his Friendship did never more plainly appear than in this Action, and upon this place; in this place he was most friendly to Sinners: In Heaven he is giorious: In Hell furious: In the World marvellous; but upon Mount <hi>Calvary</hi> he was merciful and gracious; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Mercy upon Mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> we could never enjoy his Glory in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>

For although he can command us as Slaves, yet will

he have us entreated as Sons. Let us not be ashamed to stoop under Christ's Cross; for he hath now taken away both the Infamy and the Curse of the Cross; he hath made the Cross a Tribunal, a Throne of Judgment; be not ashamed of that Name which was a Reproach among the <hi>Romans,</hi> as Gibbet-bearer, or Cross-carrier; because Malefactors used to bear their own Crosses.

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ied, let us cast our Sins upon him; for woe be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, if when they nail him to the Cross,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:32116:33"/>
they nail not our Offences with him: Assuredly, unless our Sins are crucified with him; we shall never be raised to Life by him; sear not that he will shrink from them, or shake them off; for he hath manifestly declared both his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and his Care: His Courage appears in that he forbad the Women to weep for him; he manifested his Care in shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself more sensible of their Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities than his own.</p>
               <p>But stay let us consider, and run not so fast by so high a Mystery: What new thing is this? Our Saviour would not speak one Word to <hi>Herod,</hi> nor make <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> any Answer, altho' he was urged to it; but without Request he turned his Face, and spake to them that wept after him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Herod</hi> questioned upon Curiosity, and <hi>Pilate</hi> by way of Authority; but the Daughters of <hi>Sion</hi> wept out of pure pity, and therefore the Words of the one reached no farther than his Ears, but the Luke-warm Drops of the other pierced his Heart: He takes pity up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on those that take pity upon others:
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:32116:34"/>
he values the Tears of the Pitiful, much more than the Words of the Mighty; for which cause he did not only turn and speak to those weeping Women, but did seem more sensible of their Tears, than his own Torments.</p>
               <p>By this we may see which is the best way to obtain Favour of our Lord Jesus Christ, that it is better to sue to him with force of Tears, than multitude of Words, because Words are formed by the Tongue, but Tears commonly proceed from the Heart, possess'd either with Grief or Love: Let us use few Word, and weep more, for this is the Language of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; this the most prevailing Voice to call upon God; Tears overcome the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible, appease the Omnipotent, and torment the Devil more than Hell fire: When Tears cry to God, when he is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuned by true Tears, he will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay to come to comfort us, but will grow presently familiar with us.</p>
               <p>But O Redeemer of our Lives, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is it thy pleasure that we should not weep for thee? Thou didst weep for <hi>Lazarus;</hi> thou didst also weep for the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:32116:34"/>
Stones and Walls of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and wilt thou not permit us to weep for thee? Dost thou make so small an account of the loss of thy Life? Shall we so little value the shedding of thy most precious Blood? What Law of Equity or Justice is it, to command us to love thee, and yet to forbid us to weep for thee? For how doth he love thee, that weepeth not at thy most cruel Torment? Or wherefore dost thou consent we should weep for our selves, and not for thee? Are we of greater value than thou? And can any of us be less worthily, or more shamefully punished?</p>
               <p>What shall we say? Shall we with Reverence leave this high and obscure Mystery, among many others to thy Divine Judgment? Or wouldst thou signifie to those weeping Women, that they should not judge of thee as then they saw thee; nor of thine Enemies, nor of themselves, according to that State wherein then they were? Or dost thou give us to understand too, that it sufficeth not that we weep for thee, if we do not discern how we weep; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause right Weeping consists not in
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:32116:35"/>
multitude, but in well placing of our Tears? Or is it thy pleasure we should not weep for thy Death, but the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of thy Death? According to which Rule, we have more cause that commit, than those that suffer outrage and wrong: Or wouldest thou have us to understand, that our Life should be a long Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, a continual crucifying of our selves, and that we may have more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to shew Compassion to the Wicked while they live, than the Good when they die? For it is better to die, than to live amongst wicked Men, because in Death there is but one bitter Morsel to swallow, but the Society of the Wicked is a continual Torment.</p>
               <p>Or, Lastly, Didst thou mean that we should not weep for thee, in compassion to our selves, because our Sins are so great, that we have time little enough to lament for them? And as thou art grieved at our Sins more than thy own Sufferings, so thou takest greater plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure that we let fall Tears for them, than for thee; for if we should not bewail our Sins, thy suffering for us will little avail us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:32116:35"/>
First therefore we must weep in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion to our selves, and then for thy Passion: We must acknowledge our Offences first, and then be much agrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for thy Wounds: for if thou hadst suffered for thy self, it should have been our Duty to weep only for thee; but since thou didst suffer for our Sins, it is most convenient that we should pour forth Tears principally for them.</p>
               <p>However it is, forbid us not, O good Jesu! Forbid us not, we beseech thee, to weep for thee, for if thou dost, with Tears we will entreat thee that we may weep.</p>
               <p>We will entreat thee rather not to weep for the traiterous City <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> than not to suffer us to weep for thee. O Lord of all Life! Do not only permit, but enable us to weep, and accept our Praises watered with our Tears.</p>
               <p>With bended Knees, and with all our Hearts, swallowed up with a true Sense of our own Unworthiness, and with all Fear and Reve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Wherefore then, O good Jesus, was this Extremity used against thee? Were thy Executioners so covetous as to enjoy thy Apparel, or were they so cruel to encrease thy Shame? Or wouldest thou testifie thy Love, in that thou wouldest not be exempted from any Ignominy we had deserved; and in that thou didst discover thy naked Flesh, and not hide any part of thy Body from us, as before it had been covered with Figures and Ceremonies as with a Veil: When <hi>Adam</hi> had sinned, he would have hid himself from the Presence of God, because he was naked, being then attached with Impurity of Soul, as well as Obscenity of Body, which are the chief Causes of Shame; but our Second <hi>Adam</hi> took both this Sin and this Shame upon his naked Body, to carry them to the Cross, and to crucifie them with him.</p>

Should not the Father handle thee as a Sinner, seeing he findeth thee so charged with Sins?

               <p>Hereby thou hast given us Example, <hi>First,</hi> to be merciful towards the Needy, seeing that out of Compassion to us, thou hadst no Pity upon thy self, but wert cloathed with our Sins, and our Shame, to clothe us with thy Innocency and Glory.</p>

Whatsoever will do us good he hath imparted to us, and hath taken to himself whatsoever might do us harm. But in regard of your selves, O ye stiff-necked Jews! it had been better your Tongues had been torn out of your Throats, than they should have been thus impiously employed; all your insulting is but like the putting of a red hot Iron into cold Water, to make a great Noise to extinguish your selves: For since you have disavowed the God of your Fathers, and have said, you would have no King but <hi>Caesar;</hi> since you have said, <hi>His Blood be upon us, and upon our Children;</hi> since you have mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously taken away his Life, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd his Death, your Walls have been thrown down, your Temple burnt, your Kingdom ruined, your selves either slain or captivated, or

As you have quitted him, and delivered him to the Gentiles, so hath he ever since discharged you, and planted his Church, especially amongst them. As you have renounced your King, who was so plainly prophesied, and so long expected; and betaken your selves on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>Caesar,</hi> so he hath delivered you into <hi>Caesar's</hi> Hands; he hath given you your Choice: but it cost you dear, it cost you the Lives of eleven hundred thousand Persons in one Siege, besides ninety thousand, who were made Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives. And because you did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly say, <hi>Let this Blood be upon us,</hi> but also added, <hi>and upon our Children,</hi> you have your Desires; for your Posterity have been dispersed and despised in all Countries, and in most Piaces evil-entreated. So it often falleth out, that the Wicked have no greater Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this World, than the Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of their own Desires.

               <p>But with respect to our Saviour what can be sufficiently said? To be so affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted as never was any! for he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised and evil-entreated in the midst of all his Afflictions; in all Calamities it is some Comfort to find some Compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; we desi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But these Bandogs of Satan, these Hell-hounds had utterly put away all sense of Humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from them: They were so far from Pity, that they were mightily pleased and satisfied, in seeing the unheard of Cruelty of themselves, and Calamity of our Saviour. Again, a generous Heart is more touched with Grief, to see his Enemies take pleasure in his Death, than to endure it; yea, oftentimes a free and noble Spirit taketh not his Death from his Enemies so unkindly, as one spiteful and abu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Son of God, by how much more than others he deserved the contrary. For in all our Calamities, it doth much ease the pain we endure, when we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it with the Fault we have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: But because our Saviour could compare these Contempts that were put upon him, not only with his Faults, nor his Innocency only, but with his innumerable and inestimable Deserts, he did the more grieve at them, or rather at the Malice from whence they did proceed. And further, his Love was so great for the Salvation of Mens Souls, that his Torments were not so grievous to him, as to see that they did his Tormentors no good: It was worse than Death to him, to see his Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners would make no profit of his Death: even as a loving Friend esteemeth less his Labour for another, than to find it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable and not accepted; or as a good Mother grieveth more at the ung<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Or must he deliver whom you please, or when you please, or after what manner you will prescribe? Did ever any trust in God and was not delivered? Or did God ever finally for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake those whom he favours? Or is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from temporal Calamities, an assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Sign of God's Favour? No.</p>

                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:32116:46"/>
Certainly God delivereth the wicked out of desperate Distress; many times he suffereth the Godly to sink under bo dily Oppressions; but this is no conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Argument, that he favoureth the one, or forsaketh the other. O ye great Doctors of the Law, that by Prosperity and Adversity judge of the Favour or Hatred of God, tell us then, whether God loved best, <hi>Abel</hi> or <hi>Cain, Jacob</hi> or <hi>Esau:</hi> Tell us, wherefore were not the Prophets delivered from Death, <hi>who were murthered by your Fathers, and whose Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers you did build.</hi> If such Deliverances be an infallible Argument both of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour from God and trust in him, veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Judgments of God are not only secret and unsearchable, but for the most part counterpoint to that which the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural sense of Man would prescribe. Temporal Occurrences may go and come, we may flourish, or we may wither in this World, as God in Mercy or Judgment may see best for us: But nothing makes a Man miserable or happy, but that which is eternal.</p>

It was they, who in the midst of his miserable State, most insolently insulted over him: It was they, who when he cried out, <hi>Eloi, Eloi,</hi> did in a base man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner de ide him, saying, <hi>He calls for Elias:</hi> It was they, who when with extream Faintness and Pains, and by reason of the great loss of his Blood, he did thirst, not only denied him a drop of Water, as <hi>Abraham</hi> denied to the rich Glutton in Hell, but gave him Vinegar and Gall to redouble his Torments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> He was deprived of all heavenly Comforts, which is the true Restorative in all dolorous Distress: And this was the cause of his heavy Cry; not that his Friends, but his Father did then forsake him; not that Earth, but that Heaven did not yield him any Comfort.</p>

All the Punishments which the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned do endure, are commonly brought under two Heads, <hi>viz.</hi> Pain of Sense, and Pain of Loss: Now the Pains of Sense were very sharp, both upon the Body of our Saviour, and upon his Soul; upon his Body, not only in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the greatness, and baseness, and variety of his Torments, but also in regard of the Body it self; for as it was mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culously made, so was it of a more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Constitution, of a more apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Sense to feel Torments, than Bodies brought forth by an ordinary Course of Nature. The Pains of his Soul were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable, even unanswerable too.

Agony of our Saviour, the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was not severed from the Humane Nature; only it did not exercise the Actions, to administer Comfort and Strength, otherwise than to support it from being overthrown.

               <p>AFter, when Jesus knew that all things were performed, he cried with a loud Voice, and bowed his Head, and gave up the Ghost; and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:32116:54"/>
the Sun was darkened; the Veil of the Temple rent through the midst, <hi>John</hi> 19. 30. And the Earth did quake, and the Stones were cloven, and the Graves did open, and many Bodies of the Saints which slept arose, and came out of the Graves, after his Resurrection, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared unto many, <hi>Luke</hi> 23. <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. When the Centurion, and they that were with him watching Jesus, saw the Earthquake, and the things that were done, they feared greatly, and said, <hi>Truly this Man was the Son of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What is this, O gracious Lord God! who ever saw two such Contraries com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined together! Whoever saw such Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery joyn'd to such Might! when was so great Glory accompanied at any time with so great Grief! Who is he that is so humble, and yet so high! Who is so powerful, and yet so poor! He that is contemned on Earth, is honoured in Heaven; he that is fastned naked to the Cross, maketh the Earth to quake; he that died, raised the Dead to Life. O our sweet Saviour! thou didst now manifestly declare who thou wast, and wherefore thou camest into the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:32116:54"/>
The Centurion, and they that were with him, did acknowledge thee to be the Son of God, and the Dead whom thou raisedst to Life, did testifie that thou camest to overcome Death. We will make no account of the Jews scof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing at thee, seeing the Heavens, the Earth, the Living and the Dead, did witness for thee.</p>
               <p>And thus likewise in all the other Passages of his Life, our Saviour did so bear and behave himself, that he never did so high a Miracle, but therein his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity did appear; nor did he ever so mean a Work, but his Divinity did therein shine: All his Actions participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of both his Natures; in every thing that he did or suffered, the Glory of the one was joined with the Humility of the other. It was great Humility to be conceived, but it was great Glory to be conceived by the Holy Ghost. It was great Humility to be born, but it was great Glory to be born of a pure Virgin. It was great Humility to be born in a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but it was great Glory to be worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped of the Wise Men. It was great Humility to lie among Beasts; but it
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:32116:55"/>
was great Glory to be honoured by the Angels. It was great Humility to be circumcised, but it was great Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be named Saviour. It was great Humility to be baptized among Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, but it was great Glory that the Heavens opened, and that the Spirit visibly descended upon him. Lastly, it was great Humility to die upon the Cross, but it was great Glory that both Heaven and Earth were disturbed thereat: That all Creatures adored his Death, except Man only, for whom he died.</p>
               <p>The Sun beholding his great Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor naked, drew in his Light to cover him with Darkness, for as our Saviour was betrayed, apprehended, scorned, reviled, spit upon, and buffeted in the Night; so it was not inconvenient that the residue of this Work of Darkness should in Darkness be accomplished, even as he said to the Jews, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 52. <hi>This is your very hour and power of Darkness.</hi> But let us consider, here are three Miracles before us: First, That this Eclipse of the Sun happen'd on the Fourteenth Day of the Moon;
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:32116:55"/>
that is, in the full Opposition of the Sun and the Moon: Whereas natural Eclipses happen in their Conjunction, when the Moon is directly interposed between the Sun and our Sight. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued the space of three Hours, whereas natural Eclipses continue not above the fourth part of an Hour, and hardly that. It was a total Eclipse, which never hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened by the Interposition of the Moon, by reason it is so far inferiour to the Sun in magnitude.</p>
               <p>What then shall we say, but that the Sun drew in his Light, because it should not display so sad a Spectacle! That the Heavens hid their Beauty, and suited themselves to their Makers State, that they covered the Body of Jesus, that was sacrilegiously used, with Darkness as with a Veil! One Star shewed the Glory of the Lord at his Nativity; but the most glorious Star pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>formed this Service at the time of his Death; neither was this Darkness ever better resembled, than by the Darkness that was spread over the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> but now over <hi>Goshen,</hi> where the <hi>Jews</hi> did inhabit. At this
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:32116:56"/>
time the Land of the Jews only was darkned, and all other Countries re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained Light. And that time the true Light was only among the Jews: since this time they have been the greatest Strangers to it. And at the end of this Darkness, when Jesus cried with a loud Voice, and yielded up the Ghost, the Earth trembled also, and the Rocks did rend, whereof in the Land of <hi>Jewry,</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Damascus,</hi> and in the Mountains of <hi>Arabia,</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents and Accounts of it remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Day. Therefore do not think, O ye <hi>Jews,</hi> as his Life ended, so did his Power: He that laid down his Life, retaineth his Power both in the Heavens, and upon the whole Earth; and was a less Matter to rise again, than to suffer himself to die. You cannot say, that these things which were done at the very Hour of his Death, were done by any ordinary means; wherefore you must acknowledge in him Divine Majesty, or Devilish Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice in your selves. You were mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously bent against him indeed, but if all Men in the World oppose and be against him, you see by what means
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:32116:56"/>
he is able both to declare his Glory and his Power, when no Man either durst or would open his Mouth in his Defence. He did but utter his Voice, and Five great and terrible Tongues did speak for him: The Sun, which is the lively Lamp of the World, the Earth, the Rocks, the Veil of the Temple, and the Dead, when all Men were silent; the Elements, the Stones, the Dead did speak, they all preached his Mercies, and thundered forth his Threatnings.</p>
               <p>O good Jesu, it was a great Voice indeed, whereat the principal Powers of Heaven, Earth and Hell di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ke, which did astonish the Living and the Dead. As the Cry of our Sins did reach to the Justice of thy Father, so did thy Voice reach to his Mercy: Thou didst cry with a great Voice to call the Living, and summon the Dead; that if any should lose himself, if any would not be converted to thee, it should not be because he was not called, but because he would not come.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:32116:57"/>
But woe be to every Soul which is not converted, which will not come; woe be to every Soul that is not moved at this Voice, this mighty Voice. O crucified Jesu, have Mercy upon us poor Sinners, that are prostrate before thee, and let our humble Voices enter into thy Ears, that thy mighty Voice may sink into our Souls. Give unto us a true Sense of these thy Sufferings, both of Compassion (as it is reason that the Members should condole with the Head) and also of Fear, that our Minds be not more hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy than the Earth that trembled, that our Hearts be not more hard than the Stones that did cleave, and that our Souls be not more fleepy than the Dead that did arise at the Power of thy Passion. O great Redeemer of the World, if all Creatures did fear thee when hanging upon the Cross, what will they do when thou shalt come to Judgment? If thou wert so mighty in thy greatest Weakness, what wilt thou be in thy gre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

come to thee, what will the Work of thy Justice do, and the Voice of thy Fury, <hi>Depart from me, ye cursed, into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Fire?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We adore and admire thy Blood, thy Death, thy Burial, thy victorious Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, thy Ascension into Glory: By these we are refreshed, from these we draw the Breath of Life, O our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, we desire thee only, we offer up our selves wholly unto thee; we want nothing, we wish for nothing but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thee; for thou alone art sufficient for us; thou art our King, our Lord, our Tutor, our Governour, our Father, the Paradise of our Hearts, the Nest where our Souls shall rest for ever, the Haven wherein we shall be saved, the Glass wherein we shall behold our selves, the Staff that only stayeth us, the Tréa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure whereto we trust. Who is so libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral as he who hath given himself for so vile Creatures? Who so loving as he, who hath not spared himself for his very Enemies?</p>

to thee, but dost rather help them, and accompany them, and lead them in the way, receive our loose or lost Souls which seek after thee; raise us up by the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of thy Passion, from the death of Sin, and by the same Virtue endow us with Wisdom and Strength, that by the one we may prevent, and by the other resist the Attempts of our most dangerous E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, the Flesh, the World and the Devil: The Flesh idle and voluptuous, the World vain and curious, the Devil subtle and malicious. Grant unto us by the same Virtue, that the Yoke of thy Commandments may be sweet, and the Burthen of thy Cross light unto us; that we may contemn the trifling Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis of this World, and not weakly yield to the Calamities or vain Pleasures of this Life, but that with unmoveable Minds, we may bear the one, and forbear the other.</p>
               <p>All this was done against Jesus, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Day of the Preparation for the Passover, according to the corrupt Tradition of the Jews, for Jesus, who most punctually observed the Law, had eaten the Passover the Day before; and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:32116:58"/>
because the Day following was an high Sabbath, and the Law had ordained, That the Body of the Offender should not hang all Night upon the Tree, the Jews desired of <hi>Pilate,</hi> that the crucified Bodies might not hang upon the Cross, being very scrupulous in small Matters, but had wide and naughty Consciences in Matters of Weight. Against Jesus they made particular Suit, that his Sepulcher should be made sure for three Days, lest his Body might be taken away, because he had said, that within three Days he would rise again to Life.</p>
               <p>So they buried him in a Garden, close adjoining to the City, whereby the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God did cut off many Cavils and Doubts, which might have been made, in case his Body had either been removed far off, or secretly buried, or left abroad.</p>

in the midst of our chiefest De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, should make us always mindful of his Death.</p>
               <p>His Body was richly dressed to the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, that the Prophecy of him might be fulfilled, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. 9. <hi>His Grave shall be with the Rich at his Death.</hi> And further, to manifest the same unto us, which he spake upon the Cross, that he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished his Charge; that the terrible Tempest of his Sufferings he had fully bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>n; that his Honour and Estimation was then to follow.</p>
               <p>To instruct us also, that the difference between Men and Beasts doth not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine with our Lives, but that the Dead are to have honest Respect, not only out of particular Kindness, or of Blood; not only out of general Humanity, engraved by the Finger of Nature in all Men, but also out of Christian Duty; partly in regard of the many Graces imparted to the Bodies of Men in this Life, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to testifie our Faith of the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Hope of Glory in the Life to come.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:32116:59"/>
And also his Body was put into a new Sepulcher, wherein no dead Body had been laid before, to the end that his Enemies should not suspect or surmise that he raised some other to Life, as he did the dead Body of <hi>Elizeus,</hi> and not himself.</p>
               <p>Lastly, they stopped the Mouth of the Sepulcher with a great Stone, which could not without great force and noise be rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led away; they sealed this Stone, and set a Guard of their own Men at Arms about it, to make sure as they thought, that his Body should not be taken away; but as it usually falleth out, that the greatest Enemies of the Truth, are the greatest means to advance it; so the Seals and Guards did the more evidently seal the Resurrection of Jesus, than all the other Circumstances besides: They did evidently declare, That he was not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the Sepulcher as a Captive, but that as a Victor he pursued Death to his Cavern and Fort, namely, the Grave: And there gave him so deadly a Wound, that he should be no more Death, but the Entrance into Life.</p>

But when he that would not descend from the Cross, did rise out of his Grave, when he had broken the Chains of Death, when he was returned, with <hi>Daniel,</hi> out of the Lion's Den, and with <hi>Jonas,</hi> out of the Whales Belly; they corrupted the Watch to say, That whilst they slept his Disciples came and stole him away. And this was the Accomplishment of their Malice, this did set them alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether without excuse, this is also the nature of Sinners in a desperate degree, who in despite of God and their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, will not fear to offend; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever Sin they are not able by some colour to defend, they will endeavour by another Sin to conceal.

Would any have been so adventurous, as to have stay'd the taking them off, and folded them together in such order, whilst the Watch slept round about them? All Men know that Myrrh sticketh as fast as Pitch or Glue? And what Pleasure, or what leisure can we imagine the Disciples should have to stay to pull off his Clothes, that doubtless stuck ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary close, and to bear away the Body rather naked than covered? Theft, Deceit, a guilty Conscience al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways is afraid, they want time, they dispatch hastily what they go about, they have no leisure to lay things in order; a guilty Conscience ever work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in extream Fear.
