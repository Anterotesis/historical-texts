            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He States have diſpatched new Orders to Van-Trump; and their Inſtructions are gone both by Sea and Land to his Randezvouz at St. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins. Not withſtanding, frequent allarmes arrive daily about the greatneſs of your Engliſh prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations; yet their Lordſhips ſeem reſolved to caſt all upon the chance of War. And to heighten the people in Zealand, they are fed with abundance of Rumors touching England. At Middleburgh and other places it is given out, that Gen. Blake is laid aſide, at put in priſon. At London they ſay the people are in a great upror<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Such phantſies are very frequent in theſe parts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:51752:3"/>
But how they will ſalve their own ſores, I know not; for <hi>Trump</hi> hath loſt his main maſt, and a great hole has bin made in the ſides of his fleet. Certain it is, that no l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Others are ſo foul, that they muſt be ſent home for Trimming and Tallowing. And therefore the States here have ordered 60 freſh Sail, as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit, to be ready againſt the 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

And for the better diſpatch they have ſent <hi>Dewit</hi> to quicken all the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralties; he and the Directors have already been at <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> and <hi>Saerdam</hi> to give Order.</p>
                  <p>Meſſengers have been likewiſe ſent to the Eaſt-Indy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to borrow what ſhips they can ſpare for the publike ſervice, but they have returned no anſwer as yet. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, here is talk of nothing but the having a hundred ſhips ready againſt Spring; and yet there are but few viſible, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the new ones now a building, to the number of 30 or 40. And for ſea-men you may gueſs they are not over-ſtockt, ſeeing they reſolve no Fleet ſhall go now for <hi>Greenland,</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uſe for the men againſt you in <hi>England.</hi> Wherefore the Drums have been thundering again at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> to awaken the people, and new Orders are iſſued out to quicken the Work of new Frigots. The great Eaſt Indy ſhip is making ready for <hi>Tromp</hi> at <hi>Ancuſen;</hi> and of this new ſupply reſolved on, they intend about 30 for the Sound.</p>
                  <p>Great brags are made here of their alliance with <hi>Denmark,</hi> giving our, That they expect great ſupplies thence for their aſſiſtance. But the Daniſh Reſident here in the <hi>Hague</hi> has made an unexpected motion to their Lordſhips for laying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the Treaty of Redemption, formerly made betwixt <hi>them</hi> and his Maſter, and reſume another way, which fills their heads with jealouſie.</p>
                  <p>They have likewiſe an eye ſtill upon the intercourſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt

                  <p>They have news alſo, That the Swede will inſiſt reſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the maintaining of a free Trade betwixt the Hans-Towns and Sweden; wherein they reſolve here to croſs the Swede, and give a ſtop to that Trade, by placing 3 or 4 men of War to lie in the <hi>Emes</hi> to block up the Trade of <hi>Emden,</hi> and will fortifie <hi>Delf Seilar,</hi> that they may prevent you by hook or by crook of all neceſſaries for ſhipping out of thoſe parts. <hi>Vantrump</hi> hath ſent a ſhort <hi>Letter</hi> to his mighty Maſters, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring, That he was forced to paſs from <hi>Gravelin</hi> to the Iſle of <hi>Rhee,</hi> by reaſon he could not get convenient ſupply of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions; inſomuch that many of his men are viſited with ſic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and made diſſerviceable for want of food; his ſhips and rigging much ſhatter'd and torn, by diſtreſs of weather and ſtorm, and therefore deſires that ſome Veſſels may be ſpeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him with ſupplies, both of Veſſels, Men, and Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; without which he muſt be forced to return, and leave the Merchants ſhips behind him. Whereupon the States im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly ordered that a conſiderable ſum ſhould be forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſent unto him.</p>
                  <p>Here is a great decay of Trade, and a mighty increaſe of Taxes; inſtead of comfort, our ſorrowes increaſe, and the Lord knowes when we ſhall have an end; for now there is Excize laid upon <hi>Butter, Egges, Cheeſe,</hi> and the ſmalleſt Fowl; and no man dare ſay, <hi>Why muſt we not be free?</hi> But this is our comfort, Extremes ſeldome but break their own Necks.</p>
                  <p>And that which doth moſt ſtartle them at preſent, is, That thoſe Engliſh ſhips which were blockt up by ours at <hi>Porto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longone,</hi> are gotten out to ſea, and, in defiance of the Dutch, gave them all the go-by.

                  <p>THe Merchants are now in great hopes, that fom good will be done with the King, in reference to our ſhips detained; becauſe our Reſident Mr. Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaw hath now had audience in a very honourable manner, though his Majeſty was not there, which ſo netled the Dutch ſpectators, that within two houres after the Reſidents return to his lodging, a deſperate Crew of Varlets ſet upon his Coach-man as he was coming home; and all that they did then, was onely to affront the man without blowes. But within a ſhort ſpace after, the ſame pack of Beagles ſcenting two of the Reſidents ſervants as they were going to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the firſt affront, fell upon them, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly wounded one of them in the hand, purſuing them even home to the door of the Reſidents houſe, and endeavoured to force their paſſage by ſword and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol; but it pleaſed God to prevent them, though not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the aſſault and tumult continued for half an hour. Immediatly hereupon the Reſident ſent to acquaint the King with this violence, which both him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his Councel ſeemed to reſent very highly, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning anſwer, That care ſhould be taken to find out the chief Actors, and puniſh them ſeverely; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Guard was ſent abroad to diſcover them; but as yet I hear not of a man taken. The Reſident hath
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51752:4"/>
been abroad ſince to viſit ſome of the principall men of the Kingdom, who promiſe fair, aſſuring him of the Kings and their own deep ſenſe of the violation, and willing him to reſt confident of the ſame ſecurity here as their Ambaſſadors lately found in England.</p>
                  <p>The Dutch here hath been very ſtudious to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie their own cauſe and affaires, in hope to draw on this King to imbark with them, and become Englands declared enemy. His Fleet is fitting as faſt as may be; and large ſums are promiſed by the Lord Keyſar, Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomaſter of Dort, who hath likewiſe given out, That their Admiral Tromp hath taken ſeventy of your ſhips laden with Coales, and nine of your men of war, which were their Convoy. But there are few of belief to credit this high-bounc'd ſtory. From Hamburgh news is come hither, that the Senate there is reſolved to ſend their Syndic or Recorder to the Parliament of England, which invites the Daniſh Court to have a more watchful eye toward the deſign of Sweden.</p>

and Conti; but they refuſed, ſaying, That they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged no other Powers but the King of France and the Prince of Orange. Upon which anſwer, the ſtout Elmers went from words to blowes, and for a ſhort time exceeding hot was the diſpute; but, at laſt, the Hollander being weary of action, and pretty han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomly bang'd, retired on ſhipboard, from whence they l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
