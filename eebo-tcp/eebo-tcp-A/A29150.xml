            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Ark of the Covenant,</hi> and conducted it with Reverence into the moſt Holy place; whilſt to add to the Magnificence of the Ceremony, the <hi>Levites which were the Singers, having Cym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals and Pſalteries and Harps, ſtood at the Eaſt end of the Brazen Altar, and with them a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty Prieſts Sounding with Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets;</hi> as you may read in the Verſes juſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding my Text. And certainly, if an incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible Multitude of Spectators and Aſſiſtants, if the quality as well as number of the Perſons Aſſembled, if the Statelineſs and Beauty of the Scene and Action, if a pompous expence of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt innumerable Sacrifices, and a Delightful Variety of all ſorts of <hi>Muſick,</hi> can give Life and Quickneſs, Majeſty and Splendour to any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance; the Religious Feſtival which this Chapter gives an account of, may juſtly chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge the <hi>preference</hi> above all others, that ever occurred throughout the whole <hi>Jewiſh Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my:</hi> And therefore we find, that according to God's method of proceeding with that People, whoſe more eminent Acts of Piety he uſually Honoured, with ſome Senſible Demonſtration of his favour, he Manifeſted his Approval of

this Devout Solemnity, by filling the <hi>Temple</hi> with his Glory, and giving viſible Tokens of of his more immediate Preſence. But if amongſt all thoſe Religious performances, which were ſeverally exerciſed upon this Solemn occaſion, we may be allowed to Conjecture or Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, which was moſt valuable in the ſight of God; we may (I believe) very ſafely conclude, that it was not the bare Aſſembling themſelves together, nor the Coſtly Pageantry of their Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Oblations; ſince theſe were but ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dumb ſhews of Religion, and a compliance only with the dead Letter of the Law;) But it was that <hi>Lively</hi> Sacrifice of <hi>Praiſes</hi> and <hi>Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving;</hi> that agreeable Melody, and Harmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Conſort of many Hearts and Voices, and Inſtruments <hi>as one;</hi> that drew down upon the devout performers, an unqueſtionable evidence of his Approbation; to this it was, that he ſet his own Seal, and made it (as it were) the Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of his extraordinary Appearance: For we are not told, that he took any <hi>publick</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of all the foregoing Exerciſes of Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <hi>But</hi> (ſays the Text) <hi>it came even to paſs, as the Trumpeters and Singers were as One, to make</hi>

the Life, ſhe will appear as bright and beautiful as an <hi>Angel;</hi> ſet off with all thoſe Charms and and raiſing Attractions, which may moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully Recommend her to our Affections; allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and encouraging the trueſt chearfulneſs, and not claſhing with, or condemning any <hi>Innocent</hi> Delights: And therefore nothing has done her a greater prejudice, nothing has more hindered her Diffuſiveneſs and Efficacy, than the falſe Draughts made of her by ſome ſort of People, who would have her to conſiſt in Moroſeneſs and Auſterity: They dreſs her up like a Fiend or a Fury, they arm her with Snakes and Whips, and Firebrands; and having thus made her an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Loathing and Averſion, they pretend to recommend her under ſo frightful an Appearance; It is through their means, who limn her after this hideous manner, that <hi>Muſick</hi> her obſequious and uſeful Handmaid, has run the hazard of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſcarded from her Service; as if ſhe were an Attendant too light and airy, to comport with the gravity of ſo reſerved a Miſtreſs. But in this they deal with her, as they did with the other, and repreſent her much different from what ſhe really is; making that lightneſs eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial

ſo has this been made an inſtrument of looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſenſuality; but if this were ſufficient to exclude it from the <hi>Temple,</hi> when purified from that Allay which debated it's value; <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etry</hi> as well as <hi>Muſick,</hi> muſt be baniſhed from our Churches, and the <hi>Pſalms</hi> as well as <hi>Harp</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> muſt be forbidden to us; ſince the two Sacred Siſters have been equal Sufferers, having both been proſtituted to the moſt ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Employments.

Nothing is ſo proper or ſo available as this for compoſing our minds, and ſetling them in a Sedate and quiet poſture; for reducing our ſtraggling thoughts, and fixing them to their Duty; for calming and allaying our diſorderly paſſions, or for lifting up the Soul in a devout Contemplation: When we

Signal Deliverances; ſuch as thoſe already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Deborah:</hi> It's firſt Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction into the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, was by the grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful piety of King <hi>David;</hi> who appointed cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Levites</hi> to thank and praiſe God, in a form which he borrowed from one of his own <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and which are the very words recorded in my Text; purſuant alſo to this, the Apoſtle advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes us, that when <hi>we are merry, we ſhould ſing Pſalms,</hi> for <hi>Muſick</hi> being the moſt chearful way of exerciſing our Devotion, ſhould therefore be appropriated to the moſt Delightful Act of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety; and that is praiſing God for the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold expreſſions, of his Goodneſs and Mercy towards the Sons of Men. All other Duties of Religion, ſeem to carry ſome ſort of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs along with them; for they either put us in mind of our igno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ance and forgetfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as in hearing the Word; or of our wants and neceſſities, as in Prayer; or of our Sins and Infirmities, as in Repentance; but <hi>Praiſe</hi> is ſuch a Duty, as is entertaining in it's Nature, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries no allay with it to damp our ſatisfaction: To Reflect upon the goodneſs of our God, and the many Signal Evidences which we have had
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:47888:11"/>
of his loving kindneſs; to thank him for thoſe Mercies which we have already received, and thereby put our ſelves in a condition to expect freſh Bleſſings; this is nothing elſe but the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Delight, and an employment the moſt deſirable, and moſt Raviſhing of any; <hi>it is a good thing to ſing praiſes unto our God, yea, a joyful and pleaſant thing it is to be thankful:</hi> And therefore this is the Religious Worſhip which is practiſed by the Church Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant in Heaven, as being not at all incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with our conveniency of the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate Happineſs. Indeed in our times of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, in the Acts of Mortiſication and Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial, when we afflict our Souls, and keep our Bodies under; <hi>Muſick</hi> which is apt to elevate the Spirits, and Recreate the Senſes, would appear as improper as <hi>Mirth</hi> at <hi>Funerals;</hi> but the Church has it's <hi>Feſtivals</hi> as well as <hi>Vigils;</hi> and where the occaſions of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

And certainly, if ever any People had juſt Reaſon
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:47888:11"/>
to join together their Voices and their Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and to give the greater Evidences of a Devout Thankfullneſs; We of this Kingdom are moſt eminently obliged to it, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of thoſe Bleſſings which we have ſo late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly experienced; when in ſtead of the Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of a diſmal War, we find our Souls re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſht with the <hi>abundance of Peace;</hi> and with <hi>his</hi> ſafe Arrival and long wiſhed for preſence, to <hi>whom</hi> we ſtand indebted for ſo precious a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: Peace then is reſtored to us within our Walls, Peace that Baniſher of <hi>Diſcord,</hi> that Mother of <hi>Harmony,</hi> that Band of Union to conſenting Minds, that Nurſe and Patroneſs of uſeful Arts and Sciences: This our long abſent gueſt, condeſcends to viſit us again; Let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive her with Hearts overflowing with <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude;</hi> with a joy as great, as the <hi>Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> ſhe imparts; as Univerſal, as the Bleſſings ſhe diſpences. And O!

Lord! That they <hi>would lift</hi> up their Hearts and <hi>their Voices together, with Trumpets and Cym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals, and Inſtruments of Muſick;</hi> and with Joint conſent would <hi>praiſe the Lord ſaying, For he is good, for his Mercy endureth for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver!</hi> How delightful a Melody, would this Conſort of <hi>Brethren that dwell together in Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> make in the Ears of God our common Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther! How certainly would he teſtifie his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of this Harmony, <hi>by filling the whole Nation with his Glory!</hi> Which brings me to the</p>
            <p>3<hi>d.</hi> And laſt Obſervation, which may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from the words of my Text; Namely, how <hi>Signal</hi> an Evidence God has been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to give us, of his avow'd <hi>Allowance</hi> and <hi>Approbation,</hi> of this uſe of <hi>Muſick</hi> in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
            <p>You may remember that I hinted to you in the beginning of this Diſcourſe, after how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent and engaging a manner, God was wont to proceed with the People of the <hi>Jews,</hi> in Relation to their Acts of more Solemn Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Such of theſe as were more Eminent and Remarkable, he frequently teſtified his <hi>Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> of, by ſome viſible and extraordinary <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:47888:12"/>
of his Favour; which was uſually done, either <hi>by the Fire of God deſcending from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and Conſuming their Sacrifices</hi> and <hi>Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> as in the great Conteſt between <hi>Elijah</hi> and the Prieſts of <hi>Baal;</hi> or elſe <hi>filling the place of Worſhip with a Cloud, and with his Glory,</hi> as in the inſtance that is now before us. And to whatſoever Religious performances, we find theſe marks affixed of the Divine <hi>Approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> we may very ſafely conclude of them, that not only the Scope of the Action in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, but every particular Circumſtance and Ceremony of it, was agreeable to his Will, and well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>pleaſing in his Sight; For had there been a failure in any one part, God would never have ſet his own ſtamp upon it, to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant it's currancy and perfection. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was not barely <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Dedication of the <hi>Temple,</hi> and his bringing the <hi>Ark</hi> into the <hi>Holieſt of Holies;</hi> but the Method and Manner alſo of his proceedings in it, his Aſſembling the Congregation, his offering up Sacrifices, his Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Thankſgivings, his Voices and his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whoſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> uſage was confirmed, and whoſe practice was approved of by God's Vouchſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:47888:13"/>
of the <hi>Schekinah,</hi> or Divine Preſence. Let us not then queſtion at any time, (when we exerciſe this Duty after this Solemn manner, in which we find it was Diſcharged upon this Eminent Occaſion) but that God will counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and encourage our performance, as a moſt acceptable part of Religious Worſhip: But if we expect to have it equally approved of, our management of it muſt be with equal Decency: We muſt baniſh from it all Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Confuſion, For <hi>the Trumpeters and Singers were as one,</hi> we muſt take the Subject of our Entertainment from the <hi>Oracles</hi> of God, and not dare to introduce into his Church, any ſuch compoſures as are not Sacred and Solemn: For they <hi>lift up their Voices, and praiſed God, ſaying, in the words of the Royal Prophet, For he is good, for his Mercy endureth for ever:</hi> Nor muſt thoſe who are converſant in this Heavenly Employment, Diſhonour God with their <hi>Actions,</hi> whilſt they Honour him with their <hi>Voices;</hi> for <hi>they were the Levites and the Prieſts,</hi> Perſons Dedicated to his immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Service, to whom this part of his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip was intruſted: And I would to God,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:47888:13"/>
that all thoſe who are conſtantly attendant upon this moſt Solemn Office of Religion, would conſider the Honour and Gravity of their Calling; would look upon themſelves, as enter'd into a lower ſort of <hi>Holy Orders,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing appointed to Miniſter to <hi>God</hi> in his <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> and would never derogate from the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credneſs of their Employment, by an irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Life, or an indecent Behaviour. Then would God declare his acceptance of this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, by inward aſſurances of his favour; as he formerly teſtified his Approbation of it, by outward Evidences of his Preſence. For though the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Sacrifices are ſwallowed up, in that great Oblation which <hi>Chriſt</hi> offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed once for all; though the <hi>Temple</hi> which was Dedicated, and the <hi>Ark</hi> which was pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in it, are both Superſeded by the <hi>Temple</hi> of his Body, which was the true <hi>Ark</hi> of the Covenant of God; Yet Praiſes and Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving to our Almighty Benefactour; and this Delightful way of tendring them, with the joynt Melody of <hi>Voices</hi> and <hi>Inſtruments</hi> of <hi>Muſick;</hi> has continued ever ſince in the Church of God; will (I doubt not) remain in it
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:47888:14"/>
unto the end of the World; and will after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards attend it into the Manſions of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; and make a conſiderable part of it's infinite Felicity. And this ſeems to me to be a Subſtantial Reaſon, why God here Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh'd it above the other Acts of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, by vouchſaſing his <hi>Preſence</hi> at that particular juncture, becauſe this was to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſt all the other Ceremonies; and to be a ſtanding Duty in the Service of his Church, when the reſt ſhould vaniſh and be done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
            <p>And now I have gone through with the Method I propoſed; I have vindicated the <hi>innocence</hi> and <hi>uſefullneſs</hi> of Church <hi>Muſick;</hi> I have ſhew'd upon what occaſion it is moſt ſitly employed, and have examined that Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of the <hi>Divine Allowance,</hi> which it has ſo eminently in the words of my Text. And tho' it might perhaps be expected upon this occaſion, that I ſhould ſay ſomething of <hi>Muſick</hi> in General, of its Antiquity and Excellency, it's force and energy, of that unaccountable Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and ſurprizing Subtilneſs, by which it inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates it ſelf into our Veins, mixes with our Blood,
