            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Political Aphoriſms: OR THE True MAXIMS of Government DISPLAYED.</head>
            <p>IT is evident that no Rule or Form of Government is preſcribed by the Law of God and Nature; for that then they would be both immutable, and the ſelf-ſame in all Countries. For the better proof whereof, it is neceſſary to ſhew, how far Government proceeds from Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and how far from Man; to wit, that Man is ſociable, and inclined to live together in Company, which proceeds from Nature, and conſequently alſo from God, that is Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Nature; from whence do proceed all private Houſes, then Villages, then Towns, then Caſtles, then Cities, and then Kingdoms and Common-wealths (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith in his Book of Politicks). Tho Government in like manner, and Juriſdiction of Magiſtrates, which does follow neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon this living together in Company, be alſo of Nature; yet the particular form or manner of this or that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in this or that Faſhion, as to have many Governors, few, or one, and thoſe either Kings, Dukes, Earls, or the like; or that they ſhould have this or that Authority more or leſs, for longer or ſhorter time, or be by Succeſſion, or Election themſelves and their Children, or next in Blood: All theſe things (I ſay) are not by Law Natural or Divine (for then, as hath been ſaid, they ſhould be all one in all Countries and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:32540:3"/>
Nations) for God ſaid, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.18. <hi>It is not good that Man ſhould be alone, I will make him an Help-meet</hi> (or Aſſiſtant like unto himſelf): So that as this firſt Society of our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents was of God, and for ſo great purpoſe as the one to help and aſſiſt (not deſtroy or inſlave) the other: So all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Societies, as proceeding from this firſt, ſtand upon the ſame ground of God's Ordinance, for the ſelf-ſame end of Mans Utility or Happineſs; all which is confirmed by the Conſent and Uſe of all Nations throughout the World; which general Conſent <hi>Cicero</hi> calleth <hi>Ipſius vocem Naturae,</hi> the Voice of Nature her ſelf. For there was never yet any Nation found either of ancient times, or of later days, by the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the <hi>Indies,</hi> or elſe-where, where Men living together, had not ſome kind of Magiſtrate, or Superior to govern them; which evidently declareth, that Magiſtracy is alſo from Nature, and from God that created Nature (though not in this or that particular Form:) which Point our Civil Law doth prove in like manner, in the beginning of our Digeſt, <hi>de origine Juris civilis &amp; omnium Magiſtratuum,</hi> of the beginning of the Civil Law, and of all Magiſtrates, which beginning is referred to the firſt Principle of Natural In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, and God's Inſtitution. Though Common-wealths and Government of the ſame by Magiſtrates are of Nature; yet the particular Forms or manner of Governments are not of Nature, but are left unto every Nation and Country to chuſe what Form of Government they like beſt, and think moſt fit for the Natures and Conditions of the People.</p>
            <p>By the State of Nature we are all equal, there being no Superiority or Subordination one above another; there can be nothing more rational, than that Creatures of the ſame Species and Rank promiſcuouſly born to all the ſame Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of Nature, and the uſe of the ſame Faculties ſhould alſo be equal one amongſt another, without God by any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt Declaration of his Will had ſet one above another, and given him Superiority or Soveraignty. Were it not for the Corruption and Viciouſneſs of degenerate Men, there would be no need of any other State; for every one in that State being both Judg and Executioner of the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which is to puniſh according to the Offence committed.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:32540:3"/>
Men being partial to themſelves, Paſſion and Revenge is very apt to carry them too far in their own Caſes, as well as Negligence and Unconcernedneſs makes them too remiſs in other Mens. This makes every one willingly give up his ſingle Power of puniſhing to one alone, of more, as they ſhall think moſt convenient, and by ſuch Rules as the Community, or thoſe authorized by them to that purpoſe, ſhall agree on, with intention in every one the better to preſerve himſelf, his Liberty and Property. What is it but Flattery to the natural Vanity and Ambition of Men, too apt of it ſelf to grow and increaſe with the Poſſeſſion of any Power, who would perſwade thoſe Monarchs in Authority, that they may do what they pleaſe, becauſe they have Authority to do more than others; ſince Rational Creatures cannot be ſuppoſed, when free, to put themſelves into Subjection to another for their own harm, which were to put themſelves in a worſe Condition than in the State of Nature, wherein they had liberty to defend their Lives and Properties againſt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſions of any Man or Men whatſoever; whereas by giving up themſelves to the abſolute Arbitrary Power of any Man, they have diſarm'd themſelves, and armed him to make a Prey of them when he pleaſes.</p>
            <p>I have been the longer in ſpeaking of the State of Nature, and the natural Inſtinct to Society and Government, for that it is the Fountain of all the reſt that enſueth in a Common-wealth; but if we reſpect God and Nature, as well might all the diverſity of Governments, which have been, and now are in the World, have followed one Law, as ſo different, but that neither God, nor Nature (which is from God) hath preſcribed any of thoſe particular Forms, but concurreth or permitteth ſuch which the Common-wealth appoints. Can any Man ſay that God and Nature did not concur as well with <hi>Italy</hi> when it had but one Prince, as now when it hath ſo many, and the like with <hi>Germany,</hi> and alſo with <hi>Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which was once one Common-wealth under the Dukes and Marqueſſes of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and now are divided into thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Cantons or Common-wealths, under popular Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates of their own? <hi>England</hi> alſo was firſt a Monarchy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Britains,</hi> and then a Province under the <hi>Romans,</hi> and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:32540:4"/>
after that divided into ſeven Kingdoms at once, under the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and after them of the <hi>Danes,</hi> and then the <hi>Normans,</hi> and then the <hi>French,</hi> and now a Monarchy again under the <hi>Engliſh</hi>; and all this by God's Providence and Permiſſion, who ſuffered his own peculiar People the Jews to be under divers manner of Governments at divers times; at firſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Patriarchs, <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi>; then under Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, as <hi>Moſes, Joſhua,</hi> and the like; then under Judges, as <hi>Othoniel, Ebud</hi> and <hi>Gideon</hi>; then under High Prieſts, as <hi>Eli</hi> and <hi>Samuel</hi>; then under Kings, as <hi>Saul, David,</hi> and the reſt; then under Captains and High Prieſts again, as <hi>Zorobbabel, Judas Maccabeus,</hi> and his Brethren; until the Government was laſtly taken from them, and they brought under the Power of the <hi>Romans.</hi> And laſt of all that God does concur with what Magiſtrate or Magiſtrates the Community thinks fit to appoint, is plain by the Teſtimony of holy Scripture, as when God ſaid to <hi>Solomon, By me Kings rule, and Nobles, even all the Judges of the Earth,</hi> Prov. 8.16. that is, by his Permiſſion they govern, tho choſen by the People; and St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romans</hi> avoucheth, that Authority is not but of God, <hi>and therefore he that reſiſteth Authority, reſiſteth God,</hi> Rom. 13. which is to be underſtood of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, Power and Juriſdiction in it ſelf according to the Laws of every Country.</p>
            <p>All Politick Societies began from a voluntary Union and mutual Agreement of Men, freely acting in the choice of their Governours, and Forms of Government.</p>
            <p>All Kings receive their Royal Dignity from the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity by whom they are made the Superiour Miniſter and Ruler of the People.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ariſtotle, Cicero, Auguſtin, Forteſcue,</hi> and all other Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians agree, that Kingdoms and Common-wealths were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtent before Kings; for there muſt be a Kingdom and Society of Men to govern, before there can be a King elected by them to govern them; and thoſe Kingdoms and Societies of Men had (for the moſt part) ſome Common Laws of their own free Choice by which they were governed, before they had Kings, which Laws they ſwore their Kings to obſerve, before they would crown or admit them to the Government, as is
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:32540:4"/>
evident by the Coronation-Oaths of all Chriſtian and Pagan Kings continued to this Day.</p>
            <p>The Safety of the People is the Supreameſt Law; and what they by common Conſent have Enacted, only for the Publick Safety, they may, without any Obſtacle, alter when things require it, by the like common Conſent.</p>
            <p>The lawful Power of making Laws to command whoſe Politick Societies of Men, belongeth ſo properly unto the ſame intire Societies, that for any Prince or Potentate, of what kind ſoever upon Earth, to exerciſe the ſame of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and not by expreſs Commiſſion immediately and perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally received from God, or elſe by Authority derived at firſt from their Conſent, upon whoſe Perſons they impoſe Laws, it is no better than meer Tyranny. <hi>Laws they are not therefore, which Publick Approbation hath not made ſo.</hi> Hooker's <hi>Eccl. Pol. l.</hi> 1. §. 10.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whoſoever</hi> (ſays <hi>Ariſtotle) is governed by a Man without a Law, is governed by a Man, and by a Beaſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As every Man, in the delivery of the Gift of his own Goods, may impoſe what Covenant or Condition he pleaſes; and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man is Moderator and Diſpoſer of his own Eſtate. So in the voluntary Inſtitution of a King, and Royal Power, it is lawful for the People, ſubmitting themſelves, to preſcribe the King and his Succeſſors what Law they pleaſe, ſo as it be not Unreaſonable and Unjuſt, and directly againſt the Rights of a Supream Governour.</p>
            <p>No Man can be born an Abſolute King; no Man can be a King by himſelf; no King can Reign without the People. Whereas on the contrary, the People may both be, and are by themſelves, and are in Time before a King. By which it appears that all Kings were and are conſtituted by the People, becauſe, by the Law of Nature, there is no Superiority one above another; and God has no where commanded the World, or any part thereof, to be governed by this or that Form, or by this or that Perſon; therefore all Superiority and Authority muſt, and does proceed from the People, ſince, by the Law of God and Nature, there is no Superiority one above another.</p>

            <p>'Tis plain, from what hath been ſaid, that all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment proceeds from the People. Now I will prove that they have Authority to put back the next Inheritors to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, when unfit or uncapable to Govern: And alſo to diſpoſſeſs them that are in lawful Poſſeſſion, if they fulfil not the Laws and Conditions by which, and for which their Dignities were given them; and when it is done upon juſt and urgent Cauſes, and by Publick Authority of the whole Body, the Juſtice thereof is plain; as when the Prince ſhall endeavour to eſtabliſh Idolatry, contrary to the Laws of the Land; or any Religion which is repugnant to the Scripture, as <hi>Popery,</hi> &amp;c. or to deſtroy the People, or make them Slaves to his Tyrannical Will and Pleaſure: For as the whole Body is of more Authority than the Head, and may cure it when out of order; ſo may the Weal-Publick cure or purge their Heads, when they are pernitious or deſtructive to the Body Politick; ſeeing that a Body Civil may have divers Heads by Succeſſion or Election, and cannot be bound to one, as a Body Natural is: which Body Natural, if it had Ability to cut off its aking or ſickly Head, and take another, I doubt not but it would do it, and that all Men would confeſs it had Authority ſufficient, and Reaſon ſo to do, rather than the other Parts ſhould periſh, or live in Pain and continual Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: So may the Body Politick chuſe another Head and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour in the room of its deſtructive One; which hath been done for many Ages, and God hath wonderfully concurred therein (for the moſt part) with ſuch Judicial Acts of the Common-Wealth againſt their Evil Princes; not only proſpering the ſame, but by giving them commonly ſome no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Succeſſor in Place of the Deprived, thereby both to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the Fact, and remedy the Fault of him that went before. Firſt, King <hi>Saul</hi> was ſlain by the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> by God's Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for not fulfilling the Law and Limits preſcribed unto
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:32540:5"/>
him. <hi>Ammon</hi> was lawful King alſo, yet was he ſlain, for that he walked not in the way preſcribed him by God, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 21. and <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Joſiah</hi> were made Kings in their rooms, who were two moſt excellent Princes. <hi>Shalum, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kahiah,</hi> and <hi>Pekah,</hi> three wicked and idolatrous Kings of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> were, by God's juſt Judgment, ſlain one after another. And all the Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who violated the Covenant and Conditions annexed to their Crowns, did, for the moſt part, loſe their Lives, and underwent the utter Extirpation of their Poſterities from the Crown. <hi>Rehoboham</hi> (for only) threatning to oppreſs the People, was deſerted by them, who choſe <hi>Jeroboham</hi> his Servant in his ſtead, which was approved on by God.</p>
            <p>If I ſhould inſtance all the Kings over the Children of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> whom God permitted (and appointed) to be ſlain, and thoſe that were carried away Captive by the Heathens for their unjuſt Government, I ſhould be too copious. But I will leave the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and give you ſeveral Examples of the depriving of Evil Princes of the Government, in <hi>France, Spain, Portugal,</hi> &amp;c. and laſt of all in <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England</hi>; and of the Happineſs and Proſperity that did attend thoſe Kingdoms upon ſuch Acts, which can be imputed to nothing but the Bleſſing of Almighty God which attended thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings; and by conſequence he approved thereof, and does approve of ſuch Acts.</p>
            <p>There has been two great Changes made of the Royal Line in <hi>France</hi>; the firſt from <hi>Pharamond</hi> to the Line of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin,</hi> the ſecond from <hi>Pepin</hi> to <hi>Hugo Capet. Childerick</hi> the Third was deprived for his Evil Government, and <hi>Pepin</hi> was choſen King in his ſtead, whoſe Poſterity reigned for many Years after him, and were brave Kings, as Hiſtory doth teſtify.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lewis</hi> the Third, and <hi>Charles</hi> ſirnamed <hi>Le-Groſs,</hi> were both deprived by the States of <hi>France</hi> for their ill Government, and ſuch who were thought more worthy, appointed in their ſtead. All French Hiſtories do attribute to theſe great Changes that have been made by the People, the Proſperity and Greatneſs of their preſent Kingdom. <hi>Henry</hi> the Third,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:32540:6"/>
before he was King of <hi>France,</hi> was choſen King of <hi>Polonia:</hi> But for departing thence without leave, and not returning at his Day, was deprived by publick Act of Parliament. If I were to mention all the Acts of this Nature throughout <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> I ſhould be too tedious, therefore I will mention only ſome few.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Spain, Flaveo Suintila</hi> was deprived for his Evil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, together with all his Poſterity, and <hi>Siſſinando</hi> choſen in his room.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> ſirnamed the <hi>Cruel,</hi> for his injurious Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with his Subjects, they reſolved to dethrone him; and to that intent ſent for a Baſtard Brother of his, named <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> that lived in <hi>France,</hi> deſiring him to come, with ſome French Men, to aſſiſt them in that Act, and take the Crown upon himſelf. Which he did, by the help of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and ſlew him in Fight hand to hand, and ſo enjoyed the Crown, as doth his Off-ſpring to this Day. This <hi>Henry</hi> was a moſt Excellent King, as well for his Courage in War, as for his other brave Qualities.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Portugal, Don Sanco</hi> the Second, was deprived, by the Univerſal Conſent of all <hi>Portugal,</hi> and <hi>Don Alanſo</hi> his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſet up: Who, amongſt other great Exploits, was the firſt that ſet <hi>Portugal</hi> free from all Subjection, Dependance, and Homage to the Kingdom of <hi>Caſtile.</hi> And his Son, who was his Succeſſor, builded and founded above forty great Towns in <hi>Portugal:</hi> Who was likewiſe a moſt rare Prince, and his Off-ſpring ruleth there to this Day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ciſternus,</hi> King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> for his intolerable Cruelty, was deprived, and his Wife and three Children diſinherited, and his Uncle <hi>Frederick</hi> was choſen King in his ſtead, whoſe Off-ſpring remaineth in the Crown.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Nobility and Gentry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> took Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Durſtus</hi> their King, for his intolerable Cruelty, and ſlew him and his Confederates in Battel, (and put by his Sons, leſt they ſhould imitate their Father's Vices) and elected
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:32540:6"/>
               <hi>Even,</hi> his Brother, King; who leaving a Baſtard Son, the Kingdom was conferred on him. <hi>Crathy Cinthus</hi> having ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized and ſlain <hi>Donald</hi> for his Tyranny, he was unanimouſly elected King. <hi>Ethus</hi> was, for his Evil Government, depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and <hi>Gregory</hi> made King in his ſtead. <hi>Buchanan,</hi> a Scots<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſpeaking of his Country, ſaith, <hi>That it was free from the beginning, created it ſelf Kings upon this very Law, that the Empire being conferred on them by the Suffrages of the People; if the Matter required it, they might take it away by the ſame Suffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</hi> Of which Law many Footſteps have remained even to our Age.</p>
            <p>I will end this Narration with Examples out of <hi>England,</hi> (before and ſince the Conqueſt) <hi>Archigallo, Emerian, Vorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gern, Sigibert</hi> King of the Weſt-Saxons; <hi>Beornred,</hi> and <hi>Alured</hi> King of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> were all deprived of their Thrones for their Evil Government, and ſuch who were thought more Worthy preferred in their Stead. King <hi>Edwin</hi> being depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for his Unjuſt Government, the Crown was given to his Brother <hi>Edgar,</hi> who was <hi>one of the rareſt Princes that the World had in his Time, both for Peace and War, Juſtice, Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Valour: He kept a Navy</hi> (ſaith <hi>Stow) of three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand and ſix hundred Ships, diſtributed in divers Parts for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Realm; and he built and reſtored forty ſeven Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries at his own Charge,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Crown of <hi>England</hi> hath been altered by the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and ſettled upon thoſe from whom they expected more Juſtice than from the right Heirs; Witneſs the Electing and Crowning of <hi>Edelwald</hi> and <hi>Caſebelian; Egbert</hi> not next in Blood, <hi>Edward, Adalſton,</hi> and <hi>Harold,</hi> who were all Illegiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate; and <hi>Edred,</hi> againſt the Right of his two Nephews, <hi>Canutus</hi> a Foreigner, and <hi>Hardiknute,</hi> without Title, and <hi>Edward the Confeſſor,</hi> againſt the Right Heirs.</p>
            <p>After the Conqueſt, <hi>Anno.</hi> 1087. <hi>Robert</hi> the Elder Brother was put aſide, and <hi>William Rufus,</hi> the third Son of <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror, was Elected: After whoſe Death, <hi>Henry</hi> the Firſt, his Younger Brother (though not next Heir) was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen by the People, not ſummoned by Writ. After the Death of <hi>Henry</hi> the Firſt, <hi>Stephen</hi> was choſen King againſt the right
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:32540:7"/>
of <hi>Maud,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Henry</hi> the Firſt. After his Death <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond was admitted King, againſt the Right of his Mother <hi>Maud.</hi> After the Death of <hi>Richard</hi> the Firſt, King <hi>John</hi> (Earl of <hi>Morton</hi>) was Elected, and <hi>Arthur</hi> the Right Heir diſinherited. <hi>Henry</hi> the Third was choſen againſt the Right of <hi>Eleanor</hi> Prince <hi>Arthur</hi>'s Siſter. At the Death of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, the States of the Kingdom met and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Government, by appointing Officers, and what elſe was neceſſary for the Defence of the Realm, and <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth was ſet up by the People during the Life of <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth.</p>
            <p>Now it is plain, that the Kings and Queens of <hi>England,</hi> ever ſince <hi>William Rufus</hi>'s Time, have proceeded from thoſe who were ſet up by the People againſt the next Heirs. King <hi>Edward</hi> the Second, <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, and <hi>Richard</hi> the Third, were, for not governing according to the Laws of the Land, deprived of the Government, and <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, and <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth and Seventh, were preferred in their rooms, which were moſt Rare and Valiant Princes, who have done many Important Acts in this Kingdom, and have raiſed many Families to Nobility, put down others, changed States both abroad and at home, altered the Courſe of Deſcent in the Blood Royal, and the like; which was unjuſt, and is void at this Day, if the Changes and Deprivations of the former Kings were unlawful, and conſequently all thoſe Princes that have ſucceeded them (which yet never failed of a conſtant Lineal Deſcent) were Uſurpers; and thoſe that do pretend to the Crown of <hi>England</hi> at this Day, have no Title at all, (which was yet never denied) for that from thoſe Men they deſcended, who were put in the place of the aforementioned, deprived by the Common-Wealth: And this is, and hath been the Cuſtom and Practice of all King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and Common-Wealths, to deprive their Princes for their Evil Government; and that God hath, and does concur with the ſame, is plain from the Examples before-mentioned, of the Proſperity and Happineſs that hath attended thoſe Acts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:32540:7"/>The Barons, Prelates, and Commons took a ſolemn Oath, That if King <hi>John</hi> ſhould refuſe to grant and confirm their Laws and Liberties, they would wage War againſt him ſo long, and withdraw themſelves from their Allegiance to him, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he ſhould confirm to them by a Charter, ratified with his Seal, all things which they required: and that if the King ſhould afterwards peradventure recede from his Oath, as they verily believed he would, by reaſon of his double-dealing, they would forthwith, by ſeizing on his Caſtles, compel him to give Satisfaction. He afterwards breaking his Oath and Promiſe, the Barons ſaid, <hi>What ſhall we do with this wicked King? if we let him thus alone he will deſtroy us and our People; it is expedient therefore that he ſhould be expelled the Throne, we will not have him any longer to reign over us:</hi> and accordingly they ſent for <hi>Lewis</hi> the Prince of <hi>France,</hi> to be their King, and ſwore Fealty to him, but they afterwards diſcovering that he had ſworn that he would oppreſs them, and extirpate all their Kindred, they rejected him, and ſet up <hi>Henry</hi> the Third.</p>
            <p>The Biſhops of <hi>Hereford, Lincoln,</hi> and ſeveral Earls, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons and Knights for each County, being deputed to go to <hi>Edward</hi> II, and demand a Surrender of the Crown, ſaid to him, <hi>That unleſs he did of himſelf renounce his Crown and Scepter, the People would neither endure him, or any of his Children, as their Soveraign; but diſclaiming all Homage and Fealty, would elect ſome other for King who ſhould not be of the Blood</hi>; upon which the King reſigned his Crown, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By the common Uſage of <hi>England,</hi> which is the common Law of <hi>England,</hi> Kings may be deprived for evil Government, and others ſet up in their ſtead, is plain from the afore-going Examples.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Richard</hi> the Firſt being taken Priſoner by the Emperor in his Return from the Holy Land, it was decreed, that the fourth part of all that Year's Rents, and of all the Moveables, as well of the Clergy as of the Laity, and all the Woolls of the Abbots of the Order of <hi>Ciſterſians</hi> and of <hi>Semphringham,</hi> and all the Gold and Silver Chalices, and Treaſure of all Churches, ſhould be paid in towards the Ranſom of the King, which was done accordingly. If all this was given for the Liberty of one Man; certainly much more ought to be given now,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:32540:8"/>
when all our Liberties and Properties, and even our Religion too lies at ſtake, if Neceſſity required it, which God forbid.</p>
            <p>By the Law of Nature, <hi>Salus Populi,</hi> the Welfare of the People, is both the ſupream and firſt Law in Government, and the ſcope and end of all other Laws, and of Government it ſelf; becauſe the Safety of the Body Politick is ever to be preferred before any one Perſon whatſoever.</p>
            <p>No Human Law is binding which is contrary to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or the general Laws of Nature.</p>
            <p>Religion doth not overthrow Nature, whoſe chiefeſt Principle is to preſerve her ſelf; and God doth not counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance Sin in the greateſt, but rewards the Puniſher, witneſs <hi>Jehu,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The end for which Men enter into Society, is not bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to live, but to live happily, anſwerable to the Excellency of their Kind, which Happineſs is not to be had out of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.</p>
            <p>All Common-wealths are in a State of Nature one with another.</p>
            <p>As Magiſtrates were deſigned for a general Good; ſo the Obligation to them muſt be underſtood ſo, as to be ſtill in Subordination to the main End; for the reaſon of all Law and Government is the Publick Good.</p>
            <p>Government being for the benefit of the Governed, and not for the ſole advantage of the Governours, but only for theirs with the reſt, as they make a part of that Politick Body, each of whoſe Parts and Members are taken care of, and directed in their peculiar Function for the good of the whole, by the Laws of the Society.</p>
            <p>The end of Government being the Preſervation of all as much as may be, even the Guilty are to be ſpared where it can prove no prejudice to the Innocent.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The publick Power of all Society is above every Soul contained in the ſame Society; and the Principal uſe of that Power is to give Laws unto all that are under it, which Laws in ſuch caſes we muſt obey, unleſs there be reaſon ſhewed which may neceſſarily inforce that the Law of Reaſon or of God doth injoyn the contrary.</q>

                  <hi>T. Cicero</hi> ſaith, there is one Nature of all Men; that even Nature it ſelf preſcribes this, that a Man ought to take care of a Man who ever he be, even for this very cauſe, that he is a Man. If otherwiſe, all human Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation muſt neceſſarily be diſſolved; therefore, as there are two Foundations of Juſtice: Firſt, that no hurt be done to any; next, that the Profit of all, if it can be done, be advanced.</q>
            </p>
            <p>That all Magiſtates and Governours do proceed from the People, is plain from the following Examples in Scripture; <hi>Deut.</hi> 16.18, 19. the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> are commanded to make Judges and Officers throughout their Tribes. <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.14, 15. <hi>When thou art come into the Land,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and ſhalt ſay, I will ſet a King over we, like as all the Nations that are about me: Thou ſhalt in any wiſe ſet him King over thee, whom the Lord thy God ſhall chooſe: One from among thy Brethren ſhalt thou ſet over thee; thou mayſt not ſet a Stranger over thee.</hi> So God did only reſerve to himſelf the Nomination of their King; by which he deſigned to make his People more happy than they could expect by their own peculiar Choice; he knowing the Heart of Man, and Corruption of his Nature, would be ſure to nominate ſuch who was moſt fit to govern his People.</p>
            <p>God did not require the Jews to accept of him for King whom he ſhould chuſe, but left it to their own free Will, whether they would accept him or no, is plain from the following Examples. Upon the Death of <hi>Saul, David</hi> was ſet up by the Appointment of Almighty God, yet there was only the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> that followed <hi>David</hi> and made him King, eleven Tribes following <hi>Iſhboſheth, Saul</hi>'s Son, whom they made King; and though <hi>David</hi> had a long War againſt the Houſe of <hi>Saul,</hi> yet he calls them not Rebels, neither do we find that God puniſhed them, or ſent any Judgment upon them for not accepting of <hi>David</hi> as King; and when <hi>Rechab</hi> and <hi>Banah</hi> had ſlain <hi>Iſhboſheth,</hi> and brought his Head to <hi>David</hi> at <hi>Hebron,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Behold the Head of thine Enemy!</hi> yet <hi>David,</hi> inſtead of rewarding them, cauſed them to be ſlain for killing of <hi>Iſhboſheth,</hi> whom he calls a righteous Perſon, not a Rebel: After whoſe Death all thoſe Tribes
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:32540:9"/>
came to <hi>David,</hi> and made a Compact with him for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of ſuch Conditions which they thought neceſſary for the ſecuring of their Liberty before they made him King: 2 <hi>Sam. Chap.</hi> 2, 3, 4, 5. The making of <hi>Solomon</hi> King by <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> his Father, was not thought ſufficient without the Peoples Conſent, elſe why did the People anoint <hi>Solomon,</hi> and make him King the ſecond time. We read, <hi>Judg.</hi> 8.21, 22, 23. that after <hi>Gideon</hi> had ſlain <hi>Zebah</hi> and <hi>Zalmunna</hi> with the Midia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites, the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſaid unto <hi>Gideon, Rule thou over us, both thou and thy Sons, and thy Sons Son alſo; for thou haſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered us from the Hand of</hi> Midian. But he refuſing their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, they afterwards made his Baſtard-Son <hi>Abimelech</hi> King, though he had threeſcore and ten lawfully-begotten Sons. <hi>Zim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri</hi> having ſlain <hi>Baaſha</hi> King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> reigned in his ſtead, but the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> hearing thereof, rejected him, and made <hi>Omri</hi> the Captain of the Hoſt King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 16.15, 16. The Kingdom of <hi>Edom</hi> appointed a Deputy to rule over them inſtead of a King, and gave him Royal Authority, there being then no King in <hi>Edom,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.47. See <hi>Macchab.</hi> 9.28, 29, 30. &amp; 13.8, 9. &amp; 14.41 to 49. By which it is further appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent that their Kings and Governours were choſen by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>As propinquity of Blood is a great Preheminence towards the attaining of any Crown, yet it doth not bind the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth to yield thereto, and to admit at hap-hazard eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that is next by Succeſſion of Blood, (as was falſly affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>R. L'eſtrange</hi> and many others, when the Parliament would have diſinherited the Duke of <hi>York</hi> as unfit to govern this Nation, he being a Papiſt) if weighty Reaſons require the contrary, becauſe ſhe is bound to conſider well and mature<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Perſon that is to enter, whether he be like to perform his Duty and Charge to be committed to him: For to admit him that is an Enemy or unfit to govern, is to conſent to the deſtroying of the Common-wealth. See how God dealt in this point with the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. after he had granted to them the ſame Government as the other Nations round about them had, whoſe Kings did ordinarily reign by Succeſſion as ours do at this day, and as moſt of the Kings of the Jews did afterwards: yet that this Law of ſucceeding by
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:32540:9"/>
Proximity of Birth, though for the moſt part it ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, yet He ſhewed plainly that upon juſt Cauſes it might be altered, as in the caſe of <hi>Saul,</hi> who left behind him many Children, yet not any of them ſucceeded him, except <hi>Iſhboſheth,</hi> who was not his eldeſt Son, who was anointed King by <hi>Abner</hi> the general Captain of that Nation, to whom eleven Tribes followed, until he was ſlain; and then they choſe <hi>David.</hi> And <hi>Jonathan, Saul</hi>'s other Son, ſo much praiſed in holy Scripture, being ſlain in War, his Son <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> did not ſucceed in the Crown, though by Succeſſion he had much greater Right to it than <hi>David</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God promiſed <hi>David</hi> that his Seed ſhould reign <hi>(for ever)</hi> after him — Yet we do not find this performed to any of his elder Sons, nor to any of their Offspring, but only to <hi>Solomon</hi> his younger and tenth Son. <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> the lawful Son and Heir of King <hi>Solomon,</hi> coming to <hi>Shichem,</hi> where all the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were aſſembled together for his Coronati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and admiſſion to the Crown, (for until that time he was not accounted true King) who refuſing to eaſe them of ſome heavy Impoſitions which they had received from his Father, ten Tribes of the twelve refuſe to admit him their King, and choſe <hi>Jeroboam</hi> his Servant, and made him their lawful King, and God allowed thereof; for when <hi>Rehoboam</hi> had prepared an hundred and fourſcore thouſand choſen Men, who were War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, to reduce thoſe ten Tribes to the Obedience of their Natural Prince, God commanded them to deſiſt by his Prophet <hi>Shemaiah,</hi> and ſo they did. Theſe and the like Determinations of the People about admitting or refuſing of Princes to reign or not to reign over them, when their Deſignments are to good Ends, and for juſt Cauſes, are allowed by God, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times are his own ſpecial Drifts and Diſpoſitions, though they ſeem to come from Man.</p>
            <p>He who is ſet up or made King by the Conſent of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, hath a juſt Title againſt the next Heir of the Blood and his Iſſue, who are put by the Crown; elſe moſt of the Princes now reigning in <hi>Europe</hi> would be Uſurpers, and want good Titles to their Crowns, they or their Anceſtors being ſet up by the People, which were not the right Heirs of the Royal Stock.</p>
            <p>The Laws of the Commonwealth is the very Soul of a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick Body.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:32540:10"/>Kings and Emperors always have been, are, and ought to be ſubject to the Laws of their Kingdoms; not above them, to violate, break or alter them at their pleaſures, they being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged by their Coronation-Oaths, in all Ages and Kingdoms, inviolably to obſerve them: for St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, A Prince is the Miniſter of God for the Peoples Good, and Tribute and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom are paid to him, that he may continually attend thereto.</p>
            <p>The Defence and Procuration of the Common-wealth is to be managed to the benefit of thoſe who are committed, not of thoſe to whom it is committed. A juſt Governour for the benefit of the People, is more careful of the Publick Good and Welfare, than of his own private Advantage.</p>
            <p>Allegiance is nothing but Obedience according to Law, which when the Prince violates, he has no Right to Obedience.</p>
            <p>There is a mutual Obligation between the King and People, which whether it be only Civil or Natural, tacit, or in expreſs Words, can be taken away by no Agreements, violated by no Law, reſcinded by no Force.</p>
            <p>A Kingdom is nothing elſe but the mutual Stipulation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the People and their Kings.</p>
            <p>The ſupream Authority of a Nation belongs to thoſe who have the Legiſlative Authority reſerved to them; but not to thoſe who have only the Executive, which is plainly a Truſt when it is ſeparated from the Legiſlative Power; and all Truſts by their Nature import, That thoſe to whom they are given are accountable, though no ſuch Condition is ſpecified.</p>
            <p>If the Subject may in no caſe reſiſt, then there can be no Law, but the Will and Pleaſure of the Prince: for whoever muſt be oppoſed in nothing, may do every thing; then all our Laws ſignify no more than ſo many Cyphers: And what are the Law-makers but ſo many Fools or Mad-men, who give themſelves trouble to no purpoſe? For if the King is not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to govern by thoſe Laws that they make, to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe are the People to obey ſuch Laws?</p>
            <p>Whether another has Right to my Goods, or, if he demand them, I have no Right to keep them, is all one.</p>
            <p>If the King ſue me by pretence of Law, and endeavour to take away my Money, my Houſe or my Land, I may defend them by the Law; but if he comes armed to take away my
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:32540:10"/>
Liberty, Life and Religion, which are mine by the Laws of God and Man, may I not ſecure them with a good Conſcience?</p>
            <p>Every Man has a Right to preſerve himſelf, his Rights and Priviledges, againſt him who has no Authority to invade them: And this was the Caſe of <hi>Moſes,</hi> who ſeeing an Egyptian ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Hebrew, he ſlew him. And <hi>Samſon</hi> made War upon the Philiſtines for burning his Wife and her Father, who were both but private Perſons, who knew they could have no other kind of Juſtice againſt them, but what the Law of Nature gives every Man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We ought</hi> (ſaith the Learned <hi>Junius Brutus</hi> in his Diſcourſe of Government) <hi>to conſider that all Princes are born Men.</hi> We cannot therefore expect to have only perfect Princes, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we ought to think it well with us if we have gained but indifferent ones: therefore the Prince ſhall not preſently be a Tyrant if he keep not meaſure in ſome things, if now and then he obey not Reaſon, if he more ſlowly ſeek the Publick Good, if he be leſs diligent in adminiſtring Juſtice. For ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Man is not ſet over Men as if he were ſome God, as he is over Beaſts, but as he is a Man born in the ſame Condition with them: as that Prince ſhall be proud, who will abuſe Men like Beaſts; ſo that People ſhall be unjuſt, who ſhall ſeek a God in a Prince, and a Divinity in this frail Nature. But truly if he ſhall wilfully ſubvert the Republick; if he ſhall wilfully pervert the Laws; if he ſhall have no care of his Faith, none of his Promiſes, none of Juſtice, none of Piety; if himſelf become an Enemy of his People, or ſhall uſe all or the chiefeſt Notes we have mentioned, then verily he may be judged a Tyrant, that is, an Enemy of God and Men: And by how much longer he is tolerated, the more intolerable he becomes, and they may act againſt him whatever they may uſe againſt a Tyrant either by Law or juſt Force. Tyranny is not only a Crime, but the Head, and, as it were, the heap of all Crimes; therefore is he ſo much the more wicked than any Thief, Murtherer, or ſacrilegious Perſon, by how much it is more grievous to offend many and all, than particular Perſons. Now if all theſe be reputed Enemies, if they be capitally pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, if they ſuffer pains of Death, can any invent a Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment worthy ſo horrid a Crime?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:32540:11"/>The Laws are the Nerves and Sinews of Society; and as the Magiſtrate is above the People, ſo is the Law above the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, or elſe there can be no Civil Society.</p>
            <p>He who makes himſelf above all Law, is no Member of a Common wealth, but a meer Tyrant.</p>
            <p>If a Magiſtrate, notwithſtanding all Laws made for the well-governing a Community, will act plainly deſtructive to that Community, they are diſcharged either from Active or Paſſive Obedience, and indiſpenſibly obliged by the Law of Nature to Reſiſtance.</p>
            <p>Is it not reaſonable and juſt I ſhould have a right to deſtroy him who threatens me with Deſtruction? for by the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Law of Nature, Man being to be preſerved as much as poſſible, when all cannot be preſerved, the Safety of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent is to be preferred; I ſay, he who having renounced his Reaſon, the common Rule and Meaſure God hath given to Mankind, by endeavouring to deſtroy me, is thereby become as a Beaſt of Prey, and ought to be treated accordingly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Laws</hi> (ſays <hi>Tully) are above the Magiſtrates, as the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates are above the People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He who is deſtructive to the Being of another, hath quitted the Reaſon which God hath given to be the Rule betwixt Man and Man of Juſtice and Equity, hath put himſelf into the State of War with the other, and is as noxious as any ſavage Beaſt that ſeeks his Deſtruction.</p>
            <p>No Man in Civil Society can be exempted from the Laws of it: for if there be no Appeal on Earth, for Redreſs or Security againſt any Miſchief the Prince may do, then every Man in that Society is in a State of Nature with him, in reſpect of him.</p>

               <hi>Thucidides</hi> l. 2. ſaith, <q>Not only thoſe are Tyrants who reduce others into Servitude, but much rather thoſe, who when they may repulſe that Violence, take no care to do it; but eſpecially thoſe who will be called the Defenders of <hi>Greece</hi> and the Common Country, but yet help not their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed Country.</q>

            <p>If a Man may be a Wolf to a Man, nothing forbids but that a Man may be a God to a Man, as it is in the Proverb. Therefore Antiquity hath enrolled <hi>Hercules</hi> amongſt the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

of the Gods, becauſe he puniſhed and tamed <hi>Procruſtes, Buſyris,</hi> and other Tyrants, the Peſts of Mankind, and Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the World. So alſo the Roman Empire, as long as it ſtood free, was often called the Patrocine againſt the Robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Tyrants, becauſe the Senate was the Haven and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge of Kings, People and Nations.</p>
            <p>It is as lawful, and more reaſonable, to prevent the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing of our Religion, Laws, Rights and Priviledges, from any Man or Men whatſoever amongſt our ſelves, as from a foreign Power; becauſe one acts contrary to the Laws of God and the Country, and the other being not ſubject to the Laws of the Country, can be no ways bound by it.</p>
            <p>It was thought no Injuſtice in the Ship to caſt out the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, when they found he was likely to prove the Wrack of them all; and the Almighty ſhewed he approved of their Act, by quieting the Storm when he was gone. The Scripture, that hath ſet us none but good Examples, tells us, That ſome Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſhould not have one of their Race left that piſſeth againſt the Wall: Now what were their Faults but Idolatry and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of their People? Then how can it be a Sin in a Nation to free themſelves from an idolatrous and oppreſſing King? When it is done by the greateſt and moſt conſiderable part thereof, it does ſilently imply a Conſent of God; for it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be Covetouſneſs or Ambition that moves ſuch a Multitude.</p>
            <p>When once the Chriſtian Religion is become a part of the Subjects Property by the Laws and Conſtitutions of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, then it is to be conſidered as one of their principal Rights: and ſo may be defended as well as any other Civil Right; ſince that thoſe different Forms of Government that the Jews were under, is no Rule for the Government of any Nation or People whatſoever.</p>
            <p>The Principles of Natural Religion give thoſe who are in Authority, no Power at all, but only ſecure them in the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of that which is theirs by the Laws of the Country.</p>

If Reſiſtance was Unlawful, and a Sin, ſurely <hi>David,</hi> a Man after God's own Heart, would have known it; and then he would not have involved the ſix hundred Men that came to his Aſſiſtance in the Sin of Rebellion, but have told them, that the Prince was not to be reſiſted, though never ſo great a Tyrant.</p>

               <hi>Lucifer Calaritanus,</hi> a famous Chriſtian, wrote a Book a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Conſtantius</hi> the Emperor, which he ſent him to read; wherein he calls him, and his Idolatrous Biſhops, <hi>Blaſphemers</hi>; and charges him with inviting the Chriſtians to Idolatry, and tells him, <hi>he ought to be put to Death for ſo doing, by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God, in</hi> Deut. 13. where God ſays, That <hi>he that</hi> (but) <hi>intices ſecretly to Idolatry, ſhall be put to death.</hi> And this was approved on by the great Biſhop <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> and thoſe Chriſtians that were with him, who calls it, <hi>The Light of Truth, the Doctrine of the True Faith: How came you</hi> (ſays he to <hi>Calaritanus) to underſtand the Senſe and Meaning of the Scripture ſo perfectly, if the Holy Ghoſt had not aſſiſted you in it?</hi> Now I would fain know, whether, he that is aiding and aſſiſting towards the bringing in of Idolatry, (as the Popiſh Religion is) is not as worthy of Death, as he that only inticeth to Idolatry? And this is the Caſe of many who call themſelves of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who are for the Reſtoration of King <hi>James,</hi> and by conſequence of Idolatry.</p>
            <p>Surely if God had commanded the Yoke of Subjection to the Tyrannical Will of Princes, 'tis ſtrange that neither the

            <p>In the Barons Wars, under <hi>Simon</hi> of <hi>Monfort,</hi> the King and his Sons were taken Priſoners; but the Prince eſcaping, fights <hi>Simon</hi> and kills him: The Hiſtorians of thoſe Times calls him not a Rebel or a Traytor, but a Martyr for the Liberties of Church and State.</p>
            <p>If Reſiſtance be unlawful upon any Account whatſoever, then were all thoſe People guilty of Rebellion, who in all Ages have reſiſted or turned out their Evil and Deſtructive Kings and Governours; and then the Jews were guilty of this Sin, for ſlaying and turning out ſeveral of their Kings, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any appointment from God in Scripture. So likewiſe the Primitive Chriſtians did involve themſelves under the Guilt of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Damnation, for reſiſting of their Kings and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors; and likewiſe the Chriſtians in all Ages ſince, who have reſiſted their Princes by turning them out, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And then Biſhop <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> (Author of our <hi>Creed</hi>) and thoſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians with him, did alſo come under the Guilt of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Damnation, for approving of <hi>Calaritanus</hi>'s Book, which, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Doctrine of <hi>Paſſive Obedience,</hi> was a Treaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Rebellious Book; for the Incendiaries to Rebellion, are as guilty as they that are actually in it.

            <p>Were the Doctrine of <hi>Paſſive Obedience,</hi> without reſerve, a True Doctrine, no doubt but we ſhould have had a better Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count thereof than from a few Court-Divines, who have moſt learnedly interpreted the Will and Pleaſure of the Prince a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Laws of Nature, or of the Country, to be the Powers which St. <hi>Paul</hi> requires Obedience unto, under the pain of Damnation.

               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:32540:14"/>With what Face can any Man aſſert that <hi>Paſſive Obedience,</hi> without reſerve, is the Doctrine of the Goſpel? which is charging God with as palpable a Contradiction as any two things can be, it being diametrically oppoſite to the Law of Self-preſervation, which is the Law of Nature, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of the Almighty, which Law is Sacred, and not to be infringed by any Man.</p>
            <p>God never commanded any thing contrary to the Law of Nature, unleſs it were in the Caſe of <hi>Abraham</hi> in command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him (as a tryal of his Faith) to offer up his Son <hi>Iſaac.</hi>

            <p>Protection is the only cauſe of Allegiance and Obedience, is plain, from the Example of <hi>David</hi> and his ſix hundred Men, who were protected from <hi>Saul</hi> and his Army, by <hi>Achiſh</hi> King of the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> who gave them <hi>Ziklag</hi> to live in, and <hi>David</hi> and his Men fought for the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> againſt the <hi>Geſhurites, Gezrites</hi> and the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> and ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them. <hi>David</hi> owed no Allegiance to <hi>Saul,</hi> who ſought his deſtruction, is plain; for when <hi>Achiſh</hi> told <hi>David</hi> that he and his Men ſhould go with him to fight againſt the Children of <hi>Iſrael; David</hi> offered his ſervice, and ſaid to <hi>Achiſh, Surely thou ſhalt know what thy Servant can do.</hi> Then <hi>Achiſh</hi> ſaid unto <hi>David, Therefore I will make thee keeper of my Head for ever.</hi> So <hi>David</hi> and his Men went in the rear of the Army; and when the Lords of the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> would not let <hi>David</hi> and his Men, fight for them, leſt they ſhould betray them into the hands of <hi>Saul</hi> and his Army, then <hi>David</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulated with <hi>Achiſh,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>What have I done? and what haſt thou found in thy Servant, ſo long as I have been with thee unto this day, that I may not go fight againſt the Enemies of my Lord the King?</hi> 1 Sam. <hi>Chap.</hi> 27, 28, 29. This is a plain caſe, that <hi>David</hi> intended to fight <hi>Saul</hi> and his Army. Now the Intention of the Mind is as bad as the Act; and yet it is no ways ſaid, that <hi>David</hi> repented thereof, or of his arming the ſix hundred Men (before mentioned) with deſign to fight his lawful Soveraign King <hi>Saul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Primitive Chriſtians took Protection to be the only cauſe of Allegiance: For when <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen Emperor of the <hi>Romans,</hi> (not by the free Conſent of the People, but) by the Souldiers, during the Life of <hi>Conſtantius</hi>

the lawful Poſſeſſor of the Throne. The Chriſtians did not reckon themſelves obliged to fight for <hi>Conſtantius</hi> againſt <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>; for they troubled not their Heads with the Rights of Princes.</p>

            <p>Abſolute Monarchy is inconſiſtent with Civil Society; and therefore can be no Form of Civil Government, which is to remedy the Inconveniencies of the State of Nature.</p>
            <p>No Man, or Society of Men, have Power to deliver up their Preſervation, or the Means of it, to the abſolute Will of any Man; and they will have always a right to preſerve what they have not Power to part with.</p>
            <p>No power can exempt Princes from the Obligation, to the Eternal Laws of God and Nature.</p>
            <p>As no Body can transfer to another more Power than he has in himſelf, and no Body has an Abſolute Arbitrary Power over himſelf, or over any other, to deſtroy his own Life, or take away the Life and Property of another; therefore a Man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give ſuch Authority to any, or ſubject himſelf to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:32540:15"/>
Power of another: for the Law of Nature is an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Rule to all Men, whoſe Actions muſt be conformable to that Law, which is the Will of God. For the Fundamental Law of Nature being the Preſervation of Mankind, no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Law can be good or valid againſt it; and much leſs the Will and Pleaſure of a Prince againſt the Law and Cuſtom of the Country, which ſhall be prejudicial to the Subject.</p>
            <p>As the Happineſs and Proſperity of Kingdoms depend upon the Conſervation of their Laws; if the Laws depend upon the Luſt of one Man, would not the Kingdom fall to ruin in a ſhort ſpace? But the Laws are better and greater than Kings, who are bound to obey them. Then is it not better to obey the Laws, rather than the King? Who can obey the King violating the Law? Who will or can refuſe to give Aid to the Law when infringed?</p>
            <p>It is impoſſible any Body in a Society ſhould have a right to do the Community harm.</p>
            <p>All Kings and Princes are, and ought to be bound by the Laws, and are not exempted from them, and this Doctrine ought to be inculcated into the Minds of Princes from their Infancy.</p>
            <p>Let the Prince be either from God, or from Men, yet to think that the World was created by God, and in it Men, that they ſhould ſerve only for the benefit and uſe of Princes, is an Abſurdity as groſs as can be ſpoken; ſince God hath made us free and equal: But Princes were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained only for the Peoples benefit, that ſo they might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocently preſerve Human and Civil Society with greater Facility, helping one the other with mutual Benefits.</p>
            <p>In all Diſputes between Power and Liberty, Power muſt always be proved, but Liberty proves it ſelf; the one being founded upon poſitive Law, the other upon the Law of Nature.</p>
            <p>With what Ignorance do ſome aſſert, that <hi>Adam</hi> was an Abſolute Monarch, and that Paternal Authority is an Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Authority? for that the Father of a Family governs by no other Law than by his own Will, and the Father is not to be reſiſted by his Child? and that <hi>Adam</hi> had a Monarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, Abſolute, Supream, Paternal Power? and that all King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:32540:15"/>
Authority is a Fatherly Authority, and therefore irreſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable? and that no Laws can bind the King, or annul this Authority?</p>
            <p>How could <hi>Adam</hi> be an Abſolute Monarch, when God gave him the Herbs but in common with the Beaſts? <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.29, 30. Can it be thought that God gave him an Abſolute Authority of Life and Death over Man, who had not Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to kill any Beaſt to ſatisfy his Hunger? certainly he had no Abſolute Dominion over even the Brutal part of the Creatures (much leſs over Man) who could not make that uſe of them as was permitted to <hi>Noah</hi> and his Sons, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.3. where God ſays, <hi>Every moving thing that liveth ſhall be meat for you; even, as the green Herbs, have I given you all things.</hi> Is it not as reaſonable to believe, that God would have curſed <hi>Adam</hi> if he had killed his Son <hi>Abel,</hi> as <hi>Cain</hi> for killing him? <hi>Cain</hi> was very ſenſible every one had, by the Law of Nature, a right to kill him for being guilty of Blood, when he ſaid, <hi>every one that found him ſhould ſlay him,</hi> Gen. 4.14. God made no exemption to the greateſt Man living who ſhould be guilty of innocent Blood, when he ſaid, <hi>He that ſheddeth Mans Blood, by Man ſhall his Blood be ſhed,</hi> Gen. 9.6. nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Noab</hi> or his Sons were exempted from this great Law; and therefore could have no abſolute Authority: ſince God has no where given any Man ſuch Authority, there can be no ſuch Authority; for the Community cannot make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Slaves by inveſting ſuch an Authority in any Man: ſhould they do it, it is not binding, it being againſt the Law of Nature.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Noah</hi> was Heir to <hi>Adam</hi> (I ask) which of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Sons was Heir to him? for if by Right it deſcended to all his Sons, then it muſt have deſcended to all their Sons, and ſo on; if ſo, then are all Men become equal and independent, as being the Off-ſpring of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Noah:</hi> If it deſcended only to the eldeſt, and ſo on, then there can be but one lawful Monarch in the World, and who that is, is impoſſible to be found out; ſo that Paternal Monarchical Authority, take it which way you will, it comes to juſt nothing at all.</p>
            <p>Where human Inſtitution gives it not, the Firſt-born has no right at all above his Brethren.</p>
            <p>No Man has an abſolute Authority over the Creatures
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:32540:16"/>
(much leſs over Mankind) becauſe they were given (for the uſe of all Men) as occaſion ſhould ſerve: ſhould any Man or Men deſtroy them for their Will and Pleaſure, beyond what is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the uſe of Man, or for his Preſervation, it would be a Sin, and therefore could be no Authority; for God au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorizes no Man to commit a Sin, tho he often permits it.</p>
            <p>The Law of God and Nature gives the Father no abſolute Dominion over the Life, Liberty or Eſtate of his Child, and therefore he can have no abſolute Authority; and where there is no abſolute Authority, there can be no abſolute Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection due. There is an eternal Obligation on Parents to nouriſh, preſerve, and bring up their Off-ſpring, and under theſe Circumſtances Obedience is due, and not otherwiſe. What is a Father to a Child more than another Perſon, when he endeavours to deſtroy him? Nay, is he not ſo much the more odious as the Act is more barbarous, for a Father to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to deſtroy his own Off-ſpring, than for another Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon endeavouring it? certainly in ſuch a caſe no Paſſive O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience can be due, it tending to his Deſtruction (not for his Good) which is no Fatherly Act, and therefore not to be ſubmitted to.</p>
            <p>He that lets any Perſon whatſoever deſtroy him, when it is in his power to preſerve his Life by defending himſelf, does tacitly conſent to his own Death, and therefore is guilty of his own Blood as well as he that deſtroys him: Whereas by defending himſelf, there can be but one guilty of Blood, (which is the Invader) in which Defence, if he kills the other, his Blood lies at his own door: By which it follows, that Paſſive Obedience to unjuſt Violence is a Sin, but reſiſting ſuch Violence is no Sin, but the Duty of every Man. The firſt Duty that I owe is to God, the ſecond to my ſelf in preſerving my ſelf, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the third to my Parent and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign, in obeying them in all things reaſonable and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
            <p>By all the Precepts in Scripture which require Obedience to Parents, Homage and Obedience is as due to the one as to the other; for 'tis nowhere ſaid, Children obey your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and no more; the Mother is mentioned before the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.3. <hi>Ye ſhall fear every Man his Mother, and his Father.</hi> Sure <hi>Solomon</hi> was not ignorant what belonged
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:32540:16"/>
to him as a King, or a Father, when he ſaid, <hi>My Son, hear the Inſtructions of thy Father, and forſake not the Law of thy Mother:</hi> And our Saviour ſays, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.4. <hi>Honour thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Mother.</hi> And <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.1. <hi>Children, obey your Parents,</hi> &amp;c. If Paternal Authority be an abſolute Authority, I ask, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be in the eldeſt of the Family? if ſo, Whether a Grandfather can diſpenſe with his Grand-Child's paying the Honour due to his Parents by the fifth Commandment? 'Tis evident in common Senſe, the Grandfather cannot diſcharge the Grand-Child from the Obedience due to his Parents, neither can a Father diſpenſe with his Child's Obedience due to the Laws of the Land; therefore the Obedience required to Parents in Scripture is not to an abſolute Authority, for there can be no abſolute Authority where there is an Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity above it.</p>
            <p>With what Folly and Ignorance do ſome aſſert, That the Kings of <hi>England</hi> are Abſolute, as proceeding from <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror? To which I anſwer, That a Conqueror has no right of Dominion (much leſs any Abſolute Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity) over the Wife and Children of the Conquered, or over thoſe who aſſiſted not againſt him.</p>
            <p>Conqueſt may claim ſuch a Right as Thieves uſe over thoſe whom they can maſter, which is a Right of Tenure, but no Tenure of Right.</p>
            <p>Conqueſt may reſtore a Right, Forfeiture may loſe a Right, but 'tis Conſent only that can tranſact or give a Right.</p>
            <p>There is no other Abſolute Power, than over Captives taken in a juſt War.</p>
            <p>If the Poſſeſſion of the whole Earth was in one Perſon, yet he would have no Power over the Life or Liberty of another, or over that which another gets by his own Induſtry, for Propriety in Land gives no Man Authority over another.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror made a League or Compact with the Nobles and Lords of the Land, to the performance of which, he takes an Oath to obſerve the ancient Laws of the Realm, eſtabliſhed by his Predeceſſors the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> and eſpecially of <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor; as likewiſe did <hi>Henry</hi> the Firſt, with the Emendations his Father had made to them. <hi>Stephen</hi> who ſucceeded <hi>Henry,</hi> made a Compact, and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:32540:17"/>
promised a Meloration of their Laws according to their Minds. <hi>William Rufus, Henry</hi> the Firſt, and <hi>Stephen</hi> get the Conſent of the People by promiſing to grant them their uſual Laws, and ancient Cuſtoms. <hi>Henry</hi> the Firſt, <hi>Richard</hi> the Firſt, King <hi>John,</hi> and <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, oblige them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at their Coronations to grant them, and then the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple conſented to own them as their King; and <hi>Richard</hi> the Firſt, and King <hi>John</hi> were conjured by the Arch-biſhops not to take upon them the Crown, unleſs they intended to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their Oaths. If any King refuſed ſo to do, the Nobles thought it their Concern to hinder his Coronation, till he had either made or promiſed this Engagement.</p>
            <p>What can be more abſurd than to ſay, That there is an abſolute Subjection due to a Prince, whom the Laws of God, Nature and the Country, have not given ſuch Authority? as if Men were made as ſo many Herds of Cattel, only for the Uſe, Service and Pleaſure of their Princes.</p>
            <p>But ſome do object, That the anointing of Kings at their Coronations makes their Perſons Sacred, Unqueſtionable and Irreſiſtable, for any Tyrannical or Exorbitant Actions what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. To which I anſwer, That every Chriſtian's<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is a Sacrament of Chriſt's Inſtitution; a Spiritual Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Sanctification which makes a Perſon as ſacred, yea more holy than the Anointing of Kings can or doth of it ſelf, (that being no Sacrament) a Truth which no Chriſtian can, without Blaſphemy, deny: And yet no Chriſtian is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from Reſiſtance, Cenſure, or Puniſhments, according to the nature of his Crime; and therefore the Anointing of Kings at their Coronations cannot do it; it being a Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Jews, not inſtituted by Chriſt, or any ways com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be continued by the Apoſtles, or their Succeſſors; it ſignifying only the chuſing or preferring one before ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſo became the Ceremony of conſecrating to any ſpecial Office, and ſo was ordinarily uſed in the enſtalling Men to Offices of any Eminency.</p>
            <p>The Reign of a good King reſembles that of Heaven, over which there is but one God, for he is no leſs beloved of the Vertuous than feared of the Bad; and if human Frailty could admit a Succeſſion of good Kings, there were no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, Power being ever more glorious in one, than when it is divided.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:32540:17"/>'Tis not the Title of a King, but the Power (which is the Laws) which is inveſted in him, which makes the difference betwixt him and other Men in the executing of this Power: his Perſon is ſacred, and not to be reſiſted, he being above every Soul contained in the ſame Society, and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be reſiſted, or deprived of his Office by any part, or by the whole Community, without the greateſt Sin of Robbery and Injuſtice imaginable.</p>
            <p>If a Government (ſay ſome) may be diſturbed for any unlawful Proceedings of the Governour, or his Miniſters, how can any Government be ſafe? To which I anſwer, That it is not lawful for every private Man to fly into the Boſom of his Prince, for he is no competent Judg, be he of never ſo great a Quality; elſe a King was the moſt miſerable Man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, lying at the Mercy of every deſperate Fellow's Cenſure.</p>
            <p>It is impoſſible for one, or a few oppreſſed Men, to diſturb the Government, where the Body or the People do not think themſelves concerned in it, and that the Conſequences ſeem not to threaten all; yea when it does, yet the People are not very forward to diſturb the Government; as in King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second's time, when the Charters were condemned, and ſeized upon in order to make us Slaves, and the Laws per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to the loſs of many innocent Lives, and many other Oppreſſions too many to inſert, and yet no body offered to diſturb the Government; I ſay, till the Miſchief be grown general, and the Deſigns of the Rulers become notorious, then, and then only, will the People be for righting themſelves.</p>
            <p>Whoſoever, either Ruler or Subject, by Force goes about to invade the Rights of either Prince or People, and lays the Foundation for overturning the Conſtitution and Frame of any juſt Government, he is guilty of the greateſt Crime, I think, a Man is capable of, being to anſwer for all thoſe Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs of Blood, Rapine and Deſolation, which the breaking to pieces of Governments brings on a Country; and he who does it, is juſtly to be eſteemed the Common Enemy and Peſt of Mankind, and is ſo to be treated accordingly; and how far the late King <hi>James</hi> was guilty of this, I leave the World to judg.</p>
